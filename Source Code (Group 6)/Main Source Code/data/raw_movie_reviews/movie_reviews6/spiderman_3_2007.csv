I feel I have to defend it. While I am not big on special effects and CGI, I will set those aside for the moment.Anyone who grew up reading Spider-Man should know that putting 40 years of comic history into a movie (or 3) is a hard task. But I feel like they succeeded here. Venom comes across pretty accurately considering how much they had to truncate it, and the Sandman is decent despite some interesting modifications.The biggest problem I had with this film is that if they do not make a fourth, they leave open too many plot lines. And, as far as I know, no such film is in the works. But that is more an issue of the studio, I think.","32 out of 38 found this helpful.

We have two incredible movies and then we have this one. It's definitely the lesser of the three and that says a lot, because its predecessors we're fantastic. The movie struggles to find out what it's really about and we get a movie filled with too many villains that doesn't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any at all. The acting is a little edgy this time around, but I think that's because of the script and the constant rewriting of it. It bugs me a little, because this could have easily been the definitive ""Spider-Man"" if Raimi had just removed some things from the movie and maybe added a couple of more good lines to the script.","123 out of 139 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Spider-Man 3 is adequate, but adequate just isn't enough.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1650141/?ref_=tt_urv","thecowardlylorin","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur11232826/?ref_=tt_urv","5 May 2007","My feelings after watching the third film are somewhere in the neighborhood of satisfied, but that feeling is fairly disappointing. Satisfied more or less means adequate and to follow a sequel that I consider excellent with a film that's only adequate is a certainly a step down. Positively, Spider-Man 3 does reasonably well at maintaining a feeling similar to that of the first two films. I never felt like I wasn't seeing the same world or characters and that's important to me. Continuity in tone really helps hold a series together. The Matrix Reloaded never felt to me like I was witnessing the continuation of the story and world presented in the first installment. The scenery and characters felt like weak and dull recreations and that really bugged me. The New-York of Spider-Man 3 is about the same as before, as is Peter's apartment, The Daily Bugle offices, etc. Peter, Harry, Mary Jane, Aunt May, etc. also carry over well and it's easy to jump back into their lives. Where it doesn't feel like its predecessors is in its pacing and scope. The film tries to tell a lot of story for one film, much more than either the previous installments. This makes it messy. If you took Spider-Man 1 and 2's stories, wove them together and compressed them into one 2 hour film, you'd have a mess pretty similar to Spider-Man 3. A lot of this has to do with poor exposition and the decision to include three villains. In good exposition, events lead to other events and it all seems to flow naturally. Some films end up feeling like a story wasn't really even written, but instead a series of well-crafted scenes that don't necessarily fit well together. A bunch of smaller scenes are then written to connect those scenes. These scenes can feel very forced because they often rely heavily on coincidence. The Matrix Reloaded is full of these contrived scenes and so is Spider-Man 3. They're frustrating because they act like speed bumps where the plot suddenly feels awkward and my enjoyment of the film drops. One scene sticks out particularly in Spider-Man 3 as too awkward. Venom, one of the super-villains, is swinging through alleyways when he is ambushed by the Sandman, another villain. Venom proposes they team to get Spider-Man together, Sandman agrees, end scene. This scene is needed to set up the final, huge battle of the film but just seems poorly worked in. For one it's very short, and two the characters don't know each other and have completely different motives for being villains. That the two would decide that quickly to become partners after coincidentally running into each other is just sloppy to watch.Despite how it seems, I didn't hate the film. I was just disappointed in its flow as a narrative and thought it aimed much higher than it should have in terms of what to include plot wise. Regardless though, many scenes were very enjoyable to watch and I don't just mean action scenes. The Daily Bugle scenes, as always, were great and funny. The addition of Topher Grace as Peter's photographer rival, Eddie Brock, was great casting. His line delivery works perfectly with his character's sleazy personality and his scenes with Peter are some of the best. The character Harry Osborne returns and becomes one of the film's three villains: a new Green Goblin that takes over where the Goblin of the first film left off. Harry and Peter's relationship is probably the most interesting part of the story. Their struggle between being friends and enemies makes for some tense moments. One of my favorite scenes in the film is a verbal confrontation in a diner between Peter and Harry. Playing off Peter's presumption that he and Harry are back on good terms, Harry orchestrates a bit of nasty drama that sticks a knife in Pete's love life. He has Peter meet him in a diner just to drive the knife in a little further. As Pete storms out, Harry is awash in sadistic joy with himself before making a fast and creepy exit. Harry is really the best handled villain of the film. Not only as the Green Goblin Jr. fighting Spider-Man in the sky much the way his father did, but as Harry, Peter's estranged friend, using their friendship as a pretty sharp weapon against him. The villain I could have done without was the Sandman. His character was interesting but his place in the film as a main character seemed unnecessary and forced. He's an escaped convict running from the police who accidentally falls into a big science experiment and becomes the Sandman. He is also apparently the actual killer of Peter's uncle Ben thus giving Peter motivation to go after him. This reworking of the first film's story seems very far fetched and unnecessary. The computer effects used to create Sandman are terrific as is the performance by Thomas Hayden-Church, but I think the film would have improved without him. More time could then have been given to the conflicts with Harry and Eddie and likewise Goblin and Venom. Venom is particularly nice because he's the only villain not the product of some crazy experiment gone wrong. His creation is almost entirely Peter's fault. Venom acts as a slimy toothy grinning anti-Spider-Man, who hates Spider-Man on a personal level after Eddie Brock loses his job and girlfriend and holds Peter responsible. Two villains definitely would've been enough for one film, especially two villains that feel wronged by Peter personally, not just Peter as Spider-Man. I don't really want them to continue this series, but since it seems like they may anyway, I hope some lesson is learned with number three that less really can be more. If the time that was spent awkwardly packing too many stories into one film was instead spent working on one good story so that it flowed naturally, Spider-Man 3 could have excelled the way number two did.","308 out of 471 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Enjoyable, but the weakest of the series","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2192343/?ref_=tt_urv","TheLittleSongbird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv","16 January 2010","By all means, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie, but the many flaws with the film make it the weakest of the series. But it is still enjoyable, however I did think the first two were better in terms of plot, characterisation and pacing. Well, there are a lot of good things. Out of the three films, this one is the best visually. The look of the whole film is mind blowing, with splendid special effects, brilliantly choreographed fight sequences and spectacular set pieces. The music is excellent, and the direction was efficient enough.And the acting is very good, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are appealing as Peter and Mary-Jane and Rosemary Harris sparkles as Auntie May. Topher Grace is great as Brock but underused as Venom, but as Sandman Thomas Haden Church was note perfect and the best developed of the villains. James Franco is an improvement as Harry, and Bryce Dallas Howard is delightfully photogenic as Gwen Stacey. I loved JK Simmons as Jameson, in all three Spider-Man movies he stole every scene he appeared in.However, there are a number of things that made it inferior to the first two. Basically and most importantly, and this was a similar problem I had with Pirates of the Caribbean:At World's End, it all felt a bit bloated. Two reasons made it so. One was too many characters. Primarily the villains, here, we get not one but three villains. While they were well performed, the character development of the villains felt rushed. Venom especially had way too little screen time as a result, and the final showdown between them felt a tad on the contrived side. Whereas you felt the menace of the Green Goblin and the tragedy of Dr Octopuss you are not always sure what to think here. Second, the plot as result to cramming too much in particularly with the idea of Spider-Man turning bad was rather convoluted, and was further disadvantaged by some surprisingly stodgy pacing. Other flaws were that the scripting lacked freshness and authenticity and the film was a bit too long.All in all, it certainly wasn't bad. As a matter of fact it was enjoyable. But it could've been better. 6/10 Bethany Cox","57 out of 81 found this helpful.

My friends tensely asked if I liked it, I said ""Yes, of course!!"" They nodded weakly in response. On the way home, I kept thinking to myself. ""You liked it! C'mon! It's Spiderman!"" Now, it's two days later, the euphoria of waiting for Spidey to come out has subsided, and I've begun to look at this flick a bit more (shall I say it?) critically.It's plain to see that Sam Raimi is a fantastic director. He knows when to do what and realizes that he is making a superhero movie, which is why the Spider-man movies have done so well. It's not like the recent Batman and Superman who try to hide the fact that they're just fun superhero films. Raimi knows his material and embraces it. The effects were astounding as usual. Spiderman's one-on-one fight with the Sandman and the crane scene being the major highlights. I thought these features would outbalance the weaker spots of the film, but unfortunately they did not.As far as acting goes, I'm surprised to say that Topher Grace stole the show. I remember how outraged everyone was when he was chosen, but obviously someone knew what they were doing when they let him on as Venom. James Franco and Kirsten Dunst played their usual selves (I can't help but think of Dunst dreaming of getting back to work with Sofia Coppola while doing these films). However, Tobey Maguire REALLY disappointed me. I've always thought he was so great at Spidey, which is undeniable in the first two films and even in this one...when he has his red suit on. Maguire is a one note actor, at least as far as Spidey goes. He just could not pull off the black suit; he wasn't good at being bad. Then came the horrific bridge scene with MJ. Along with most other people I've talked to, my entire theater erupted in laughter when he started crying. It was just...sad...and not in the way the writers intended it.Speaking of the writing, I hate to be beating a dead horse, but c'mon: 3 villains, Sandman's background, trouble with MJ, Harry's changing attitudes, 2 different Spidermans, competition at the Bugle, Gwen Stacy, etc. It was just WAY TOO MUCH! Even if you had four hours, it's just too much to cram into the audience in one sitting. The great thing about Spiderman 2 (the best of the trilogy) is how focused it was. You had the inner struggle, the villain and his relationship with MJ. There it was! Beautifully filmed and written. From the first 15 minutes of Spiderman 3, I knew that all these parallel story lines were going to crash within the next two hours. The sequence that shows how far they've fallen from part two is the whole emo/hair in the eyes/eyeliner/oh so cool ""bad"" Spiderman scenes. The first few minutes of this was funny in the same way that the ""Raindrops are Falling on my Head"" scene in part two was great, but this time they stretched a good thing way too far. This whole sequence is what sticks in my mind and refuses to let me think that the film was just as great as the rest.I tried to like it! I really did! I just can't fool myself any longer. Some critics like Peter Travers for Rolling Stone are saying that we can let this one slide because it's Spiderman, but I couldn't disagree more. Spiderman 3 missed the mark and, deep down inside, we all know it.","1,012 out of 1,478 found this helpful.

While it does contain some of the best action sequences I've ever seen, it is far from the best film ever made.The problem with the film is that there is simply too much going on. First off you have the Peter/MJ relationship bumping along, add to that the Peter/Harry story line still playing out, plus we have the addition of the Sandman story and coming in in the final half hour is the addition of Venom. Its too much for the movie to handle, the result of which it all feels half baked. Very few of the characters get the proper amount of time to develop with the worst offender is Eddie Brock and Venom who get zero and so seem to belong in another movie (Venom looks great which makes his under use seem even worse). The real proof the film has too much going on was that there are a couple of times where the plot is moved along by sudden out of left field revelations. The only one I""ll reveal, because its in the trailer, is that Sandman killed Uncle Ben in the first film. Had the film been better plotted the revelation wouldn't have been necessary, nor would any of the others. There are some bright spots, the majority of the Sandman material is sterling, with the first appearance of Sandman in the sand pit almost perfect, and the sequence that makes up his first battle with Spidey one of the greatest things I've ever seen put on film. The Sandman sequences alone make it worth slogging through the ups and downs of the rest of the movie.Is it a bad movie? No, just a disappointing one. Its clear that this could have and should have been the best in the series (and maybe the best film of the year) had all of the right pieces been put in place, indeed the final sequences in the film probably would have reduced most audiences to tears had they gotten the rest of the film right.As I said the film is worth seeing at some point, just don't feel the need to run out with everyone else. Was it worth fighting the crowds the first weekend to see? Not really, but it is worth seeing. Hopefully they'll take a break before they make the next one, maybe they'll make the one that this movie should have been","196 out of 312 found this helpful.

The movie starts off nicely with a great looking action sequence that implies how great the rest of it could be. The special effects are fantastic. Unfortunately, the movie is so convoluted that anything like a coherent plot is lost, as well as any significant character development further than Harry, Mary Jane or Peter himself.Peter's ""transformation"" into a darker self when he dons the dark suit is laughable. You're not sure whether you're watching a comedy, a drama, or a purposefully ridiculous B movie. Peter's actions are so over the top that you just want to laugh at the script rather than WITH it.The main villains get only a short amount of screen time, and by the ""big"" ending you're just wondering when Dawson's Creek is going to end and when Spiderman 3 will begin. 90% of the film consists of Peter Parker walking around, crying, and making a fool of himself in various over-the-top ways. Perhaps I went in with too many expectations, such as the possibility of an atmosphere to the film that would fit with what was happening.As a fan of the old cartoon, and a real fan of Venom, I was incredibly let down by the amount of time spent on his character, as well as the fact that Topher Grace is essentially Eric from That 70's Show, and I don't mean that it's the same actor. He's the same scrawny, sarcastic joker that he always plays, which, if you're familiar with the comic or the cartoon, Eddie Brock was NOT. Even if you've never heard of Venom or aren't a big fan, the villain has a total of about fifteen minutes on screen and isn't very exciting, nor is anything about him explained. He's simply suddenly THERE, as if thrown into the movie only to get butts in the seats. So feels the entire movie. It all seems like filler, even as the end credits start.There was a point about halfway through the movie that I simply gave up trying to justify the movie, and realized that it was just plain bad. They tried to do too much, and by having so many villains, weren't able to make a single one very deep. And the whole ""inner conflict"" theme is a joke. Literally. Peter's ""dark side"" is more comedy than anything else.I recommend waiting for this to come out on video and giving it a rent if you're really that much of a fan. Overall, it's a big let down considering the expectations and hype surrounding it.","783 out of 1,362 found this helpful.

Impossible? Well... some of the reviewers here on IMDb seem to agree. I, however, do not. I went into this film with some trepidation and reasonable expectations. The Venom saga has been, since it first appeared in print, one of my all-time favorite multiple issue story arcs in comics. How this story could be made into a film following in the somewhat less weighty footsteps of Spiderman and Spiderman 2 was hard to imagine. The film did justice to the story-line - keeping almost all of its dark thematic content, while modifying its plot points and reducing its heavy depressive tone in order to keep the film entertaining and fast-paced. But don't expect this to be the same lengthy exploration that the comics provide.Sam and Ivan Raimi can add this to their long list of satisfying films.Briefly, Spiderman is having his normal share of growing pains. His love for MJ is now matched by his self-absorption and his addiction to heroism. Of course Harry still wants to kill him to avenge his father's death, and somewhere out there is his uncle's killer - who is about to become The Sandman. Just as things really start to fall apart, his costume turns black and develops a sinister aspect. He becomes more powerful, more ruthless, and a more conflicted being than the hero he had been. And Peter even dons black eye liner and a decidedly emo haircut. Unlike most recent comic book adaptations on the big screen, the story (to this point) offers plenty of room for humor, which Raimi could never pass up. J. J. Jameson and Bruce Campbell's excellent cameo are pure comedic relief from the somewhat heavy subject matter that seems immanent throughout this film. You'll laugh... you'll cry... You'll fall in love, if you can handle a new take on the classic Venom tale, with some worthwhile additions.Things go from bad but kind of funny to worse and pretty serious. The film explores emotions more than any superhero film I have thus far seen - with the possible exception of the original Punisher. It nicely studies Spidey's humanity, ego, fallibility, and his previously unexplored dark side, and forces our hero to confront all three both symbolically and physically in order to redeem himself.Tobey Maguire turns in his best Spidey performance yet, and is excellently supported by Kirsten Dunst and Rosemary Harris. James Franco turns in a great interpretation of Harry - much needed for this story-line. This cinematography is more wide-open and hyperbolic than the previous Raimi Spiderman films - as one would expect given the storyline. It is not surprising that the film went a little beyond the pale in terms of special effects - again unavoidable given the subject matter. But the CGI did become a little distracting towards the end.I have read a lot of disappointed reviews of this film, but honestly, I found much to praise and very little to complain about. Highly recommended especially for Venom fans.","187 out of 311 found this helpful.

I thought it was hammed up and bloated with special effects that are hallmarks for most summer releases. However, after watching it a few more times the movie has grown on me to the point that I think this was, while not a great masterpiece, a very good film.Sure, there are plot holes and characters that aren't truly developed or fleshed out. Some scenes are down right ridiculous (the night time experiment that spawns Sandman). Yes, some of the CGI borders on cartoonish - the fight between Sandman and Spiderman in the subway comes to mind. And there are clichés, like the old damsel-in-distress scenarios that Mary Jane continually finds herself in. But this is a superhero flick and it's not supposed to be completely realistic. So like Steve Winwood says, just roll with it.What makes this movie rewatchable is the acting and the overall theme of forgiveness as it pertains to Peter Parker and Spiderman. Tobey Maguire, Thomas Haden Church, and of course J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson rise above the hokiness and give great performances. Even James Franco delivers - he just plays a great jerk. And Rosemary Harris makes the best of her limited role as Aunt May and gives a high quality performance. Kirsten Dunst is the weak link again I don't know I just don't like her in these films.The final scene between Spiderman and Sandman was very touching and done so well. In the end, Peter learns how to truly forgive, an act that releases his heart from all of the pain he's been carrying around since his Uncle was murdered. Although I despised this final scene on the first viewing, thinking it was a little too tidy and contrived, I now realize that this was the culmination of the trilogy that finally rounds out who Spiderman truly is. The dark, vengeful corner of Peter's heart which the Symbiote latched onto was exposed and destroyed by the love he demonstrated after Sandman's confession. Peter saw what he would have become - Venom - if he did not confront his hatred and then let it go. This final installment in the series is a fine capstone. In all, one of the better superhero and summer blockbuster movies I've ever seen.","9 out of 11 found this helpful.

After the first two films literally set the character scenes and the hopeful return of the goblin this film could have been fantastic!Sadly however by slipping in some terrible and cheesy dialogue, an over-abundance of new characters and then trying to take on one of the greatest characters from the comics and cartoons the film comes out with an average marking!Firstly I have to say I enjoyed this film, it was fun, the special effects were fantastic and the fight scenes therefore played out very well.This film did however destroyed any character building made by the previous two and results in a serious lack of cohesion to the other two and because of this cannot be placed within the same league.Sandmand and the new goblin both admirable foes and both shown well, however venom could have been so much more and came across far too weak as far as I am concerned and seemed to be slipped on the back of an average film to try and boost ratings. I am not one for cliffhangers in large franchises, I mean the only reason I didn't see the 3rd matrix film was because the cliffhanger was pointless and the second film killed off any point of a third, however a full venom film would have made sense due to its sheer fantastic reasoning and design, even introducing the character carnage would have been fantastic, but he seems rushed in this film, and thats not the way to win over die hard fans and new fans the like!Anyway, I appear to be ranting, I would recommend you watch this film, its fun, its got great action and the Bruce Campbell cameo was fantastic, however do not watch this thinking you are going to get the same quality and attention to detail as the first two films, watch it like X-Men 3, as this is just what it is, a good trilogy spoilt by the lack of development and the need to force as many characters in at once. Oh and by the way, if you love over the top American patriotism, then this is definitely the film for you!","200 out of 349 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Big-Budget Special-Effects Extravaganza, Out Of Focus","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1650558/?ref_=tt_urv","HalRagland","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur8329378/?ref_=tt_urv","6 May 2007","""Spider-Man 3"" comes really close to being as difficult to follow as an ""X-Men"" movie. Well, maybe not that close since an ""X-Men"" movie requires the viewer to try to follow the lives of at least a dozen different characters. But I think it was a mistake for the makers to have Spidey contend with three different villains in one film. Unlike the two superior predecessors, it felt like they were trying to cram three movies into one with ""Spider-Man 3"".I was most disappointed with the use, or misuse, of the Harry Osborne/Green Goblin character. We know that Harry must become the Green Goblin if he is going to have the ability to take on his super hero nemesis Peter Parker/Spider-Man. The makers of ""Spider-Man 3"" waste no time in picking up where ""Spider-Man 2"" left off. Not only does the movie not allow the viewer to observe Harry's transformation into the Green Goblin, but Harry doesn't even dress appropriately for his role. He wears a black uniform and never becomes the public menace his father did. I was looking forward to the Daily Bugle covers about the return of the menace of the Green Goblin. Instead Harry's campaign of revenge against Peter is quickly side tracked by a bout with amnesia after suffering a blow to the head in a fall during his first fight with Peter. After all, the film needs to introduce two more villains, Sandman and Venom, before it ends.Whereas, in the first two films the viewer really gets to know the Norman Osborn and Otto Octavius characters, in ""Spider-Man 3"" the length of time devoted to the villains amounts to a movie short. Along the way Peter Parker must also contend with his dark side and his troubles in his relationship with his love Mary Jane Watson. Meanwhile, the landlord's daughter, Ursula, is back to amuse viewers once again with her adolescent crush on Pete. Add to all this the time needed to develop the Sandman and Venom villains, plus Gwen Stacy, and I was left wondering exactly what the movie is about.""Spider-Man 3"" is big budget extravaganza that is out of focus in the areas of character and plot development. While it has its laugh inducing comic moments and the best special effects sequences money can buy, it has little else to offer. While I really wanted to see the first two movies again, because I enjoyed the transformation of the main characters into super heroes and villains, it feels like the only reason to see ""Spider-Man 3"" is to check out the special effects again. If there are more Spider-Man films made, and there is no reason to believe there won't be given the money involved in releasing another film, then I would hope that the makers would simplify the story once again and do what made the first two films so enjoyable to watch.","244 out of 409 found this helpful.

As a film critic, there's a lot to be desired.The action and effects are easily the best in the series. Some of the most stunning effects I have seen. Unfortunately, the acting and dialogue is probably the worst.The Good: I appreciate what elements Sam Raimi brings to this film from the comic, specifically, the Venom symbiote. It's a gutsy move to include it, because it's a stretch for the casual Spider-Man fan to digest an alien coming down and taking over Peter Parker (& Brock), but hey, it's true to the comic.I also loved the Sandman action sequences, good use of his powers. But making him the gunman of Peter's uncle Ben was a little over the top for me, especially given the ending. To Raimi's defense, at least they give you SOME reason to understand the Sandman's motivations. I was really hoping Venom would be better utilized but he was more of a one-hit wonder character than anything substantial. He's more used as a device to demonstrate the alien's power over people.In the end, the action sequences are wonderful and thrilling and found myself wanting to rewind and watch is slow motion more than once.The Bad: Much of the dialogue is forced, failing to flow nearly as easily or believably as 1 or 2. Tobey Maguire seems far less comfortable with the character in this film, which is surprising and unfortunate. Too many homage scenes too, where the writers felt they should give EVERY character that's been in any of the first films at least 5-10 minutes of screen time (like the landlord and his daughter.) This was a huge complaint I had about Pirates II...give us substance instead of what you THINK we want to see more of.Also, there's times where scenes are so unbelievable from a HUMAN standpoint, you almost can't believe the scene was ever approved. Case in point - in one scene, Gwen Stacy barely clings to a damaged building, dangling 30 stories up. Below are her father and boyfriend watching from the street. One would think they would be panic stricken, especially the father. Instead, both as docile as two strangers watching the evening news. They are so blase in fact, that Brock (Stacey's BF) takes the opportunity to tell the her father that he's been dating her. Meanwhile, she's seconds from death. I felt more panic from the extra in Spider-Man 1 where she's waiting to see if her baby is rescued from a burning building.And my biggest issue should not be news to Hollywood - GOOD MOVIES DO NOT NEED TO BE 2.5 HOURS LONG! This movie could have EASILY dropped 30-40 minutes and been a great film. They spend WAY too long on needless scene after needless scene (the part where Parker shows up with Stacy at the Jazz club could have been a 5 minute scene; instead, it's dragged on for 15 minutes and it's not even a good scene.) What's worse, many of these unnecessary scenes are redundant - how many dramatic scenes do we need to illustrate the tension between Parker and MJ? I didn't count, but it seemed like 20 when there only needed to be maybe 3.In the end, despite my complaints, I did enjoy the film. It's a must-see on the big screen given its effects and cinematography. If there is a SM4, let's hope for a less contrived and convoluted script.","14 out of 20 found this helpful.

As soon as it came out the comic book nerds started whining about how Sam Raimi did something wrong and whatnot. The truth is that someone will always find something wrong or different from the comics, and it could have been... but it isn't!! So stop whining and enjoy it.It's very good (gave it 8/10), filled with cgi and fast-paced action, along with a decent script and dialogue. Maybe not as good as the first two, it has weak spots like several plot holes and insufficient character development. Casting was great, with Thomas Haden Church as Sandman and Topher Grace as Venom, along with the original cast. The acting was great, sometimes awkward, a great cameo from Bruce Campbell, and a great job from Raimi. It's what someone should expect from a summer blockbuster, and even more, something to expect from a Spider-Man like movie.","62 out of 118 found this helpful.

It was what I thought.Exactly, filmmakers discovered that #2 was successful because we were in the human side of the characters at the same time with the hero and superhero story experience. They (producers, filmmakers, writers, etc) were too far trying to play with #2 formula and they got a Very Unbelievable film..""Tacky"", ""Corny"" and ""A Real Latino Soap-opera"":* Spider Black, a new character that is so clever and acting like a ""bad guy"". Funny. And as a Peter, with that new hair style and punky-make up...trying to walk like Travolta (saturday night fever) with the wrong song, and ""shooting pistols with hands"" to girls in the street...Even them did run away. ""hahahaha"". But at least, he got that Venom (Topher) got fired. We need a smarter writer.* Oh my gush, Tobey is dancing 2 ""coreographies"" (Xanadu) in the film....because a touch of musicals never is bad in today's Hollywood films. He is terrible (talented actor, terrible dancer)...Give me a break.* Now Peter is Sally Field @ the Oscars?: ""They love me, They really love me"" Nooo Please !!!!* Spider Red kissing and saving the life of Cromwell's daughter for the drama of ""jeaulosy"" of Mary Jane. (The writer watch too much Latino Telenovelas (soap-operas) (I am Latino, I know what I am talking about). * Mary Jane...she never was so needy girl before. Where did her ovaries go?. Her doubts between Harry or Peter. Oh please she didn't get amnesia...It was Harry the cuckoo.* The New Goblin that gets amnesia in the right moment to confuse Mary Jane. Before he could remember his revenge, and at the end, he is coming to help and die for his hated pal. Please.* A SandMan, that is not so bad, the man is always in the wrong place in the wrong time, even Peter/Spidey believed that he is his uncle killer...Come on !!! Etc etc etcSorry guys but the audience in the theater was bored at the middle of the film. Looking around the theater.

So I guess this movie is worth seeing once on the big screen. But I am not going to buy it.Why? Because Spider-Man 2 was an amazing film and although it had those random cheesy scenes of slow-motion and stuff, it still was amazing and had wonderful plot and Alfred Molina really brought some depth to his character. But in the end, Spider-Man 3 lacks those qualities. It lacks strong plot that really brings this movie together cohesively. Instead, the film is really just a mess of stuff happening. It was overkill in every region of the film: too many characters, too many villains, too many dramatic shifts, too many unexplained scenes that didn't fit into what was going on, and by far, too much weird creepy stuff.What I mean is that Tobey Maguire's character is supposed to be influenced by the symbiote like it influences Brock to become Venom, but in the end, Tobey Maguire can't play evil or bad so much as just creepy. And although the film really seemed to be going for realistic unlike the first two (less campy comic stuff and more dramatic feeling), it still ended up with the one sequence in the middle of the film which was just UNNECESSARY!!!! You will know what it is when you see it.Furthermore, as far as the acting goes, Tobey Maguire didn't do much for me. He seemed to finally show the fact that he really just wasn't right for the role in the end. Surely he fills the costume out right, but when he's walking around as Peter Parker, he really doesn't fit the role. In this film, James Franco is truly the scene-stealer and best actor of the film! They finally gave him screen time as he is in it quite a bit. I loved him and he definitely made the movie worthwhile in the end. Kirsten Dunst also surprised by playing MJ as a much more mature MJ and less like a damsel in distress all the time. She really did a good job. And she sings, and she actually sings well!!! It was a shock, I thought it was someone else but you can tell that it's her voice! It's a total shock! And also, Thomas Haden Church as Sandman was a very good choice, but unfortunately he just totally was not given enough screen time. Again, too many villains to focus on so Sandman and Eddie Brock as Venom become little more than appearances for the ending battle. Venom was done well and Topher Grace really did a good job, but again, lack of screen time. Also, Bryce Dallas Howard appears for about ten minutes and does a decent job with what little she was given. Unfortunately, although I think she's going to be an amazing actress in the future, her role in this film made me angry because all it did was make Spider-Man/Peter Parker very unlikable.All in all, this film lacks direction and story and is just a webbing of random connected scenes and events and ideas that were thrown together. Extreme deviation from the comics is present in this film and I think the deviation is definitely bad because it makes the film too predictable and too sentimental and gooey. Oh, and this is perhaps the most pro-United States propaganda film I have seen in recent years! Beware the scene when Spider-Man is seen in front of a giant American flag: you will laugh your butt off it is so obnoxious.","60 out of 121 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, this film really is a let down, especially if you were to be a huge fan or really enjoyed the first two films! The major problems were the storyline, the feeble attempt at trying to include comedy in it, and to be honest, the acting isn't that great! I also think they tried to put too much into it instead of making it more of a classic superhero film! I don't really think there was enough action in the film and therefore it didn't use the characters to their full potential, especially Sandman! Wasted in my opinion because they could have done so much more! The big budget obviously still allowed them to make the film look good with the special effects, but unfortunately the visual was actually the best bit about the black suit and the whole 'good Spidey vs. evil Spidey'! Now, this does sound like a bad review but all it is really is meaning to say that they had so much they could have done, and they just didn't hit the mark!

I got the comics when I was a kid (sold then later (bangs head against the wall)) and I've seen and bought the previous two movies. But after seeing this for the first time, my first impression is that I am not going to buy this one.There is the obvious criticism about the black suit, of course, and how Peter gets it (don't worry, won't spoil it for you), but that's a detail, really, as the way he got it in the comics would take not just an entire movie, but a whole range of characters we haven't seen on screen before, so there is no way they could make that work. The solution they chose is fine, albeit somewhat unimaginative.I've wondered why I felt disappointed when I left the theater. Part of my disappointment lies in the fact that apparently for Spider-man 3, better had to mean: more. More action, more enemies, more Bang. And I disagree with that. So much is dealt with in this episode, that nothing gets much depth. Or rather: it doesn't come together as a movie. There's no glue, and when the dust settles in the end, we're not left with much.Another issue was credibility. At several points during the movie I shook my head in disbelief and asked myself: why does this happen? What's the motivation, the reasoning behind it? That question applied to the actions of at least 4 characters. Getting from A to B in a movie can be necessary, but do take some care as to how you pull it off! I'll go see it again, see if perhaps I'm just having a bad day. I mean: there's some good stuff in there as well, and the scene in the jazz club is awesome. There's enough for me to tell you you should probably go see this if you're a Spidey fan, but I didn't feel the spark.For now: 6 out of 10 - I'm disappointed.","31 out of 61 found this helpful.

Yes, it packed a ton of things into it, but it made it feel more like an event. I have read comics in my life, mainly Spider-Man and Batman comics... I'm familiar with the original comics origin story of Venom and all of these characters before they hit movie screens, but I still can't understand some of the hatred and criticism that the film got. There are issues, which I'll list below, but the film has a strong emotional core with its characters that shines through here.The dramatic elements, according to many reviewers and critics are done poorly here, but that's not the case. It's easy to feel the hurt Peter feels when MJ has to break some horrible news to him, you see his anger when he realizes Marko's connection to his murdered uncle, Ben, and the roller coaster that is Harry throughout the film even lets you sympathize with his position because you see, for the first time since the first film and done even better here, a more ""innocent"" side to Harry, though it doesn't last long.Also, I did read plenty of online reviews prior to viewing and many of them gave me the feeling that the only way Peter's anger and 'dark side' is shown is through a dance number in a jazz club, which is not the case at all. You see Peter going overboard and saying and doing hurtful things all throughout the mid-section of the film, causing problems for himself and other characters and fully descending deeper and deeper into his own vengeance and anger. A lot of this part of the film is lightened with comedic elements, which is true. There is indeed a dance number, but there's a point to it and plays into a more emotionally charged scene later on. If you've read anything about tonal shifts or the film being called a ""mess"", I'd say don't believe it. It's done with class and maturity to make it a bit more fun, yet it doesn't take away from the more emotional and mature scenes that come prior and afterward.Of the fight scenes, all were done well. Sandman's scenes throughout are usually the most beautiful and interesting, while Venom is done quite well too. One thing I did sorely miss was the use of the plural speech from Venom. A ""We're not Brock... we are Venom!"" line might have been nice. Its a minor grievance though, and all of the action scenes are done quite well, specifically the first and last.The film is flawed, yes, but it's also quite fun. This is a small list of issues that are present throughout the film that are result of mostly lazy scriptwriting/storytelling, but didn't ruin the movie, at least for me.Issues: - Harry's Amnesia: Amnesia always feels like lazy writing, in almost every case (except maybe Memento). In this case, it's fairly weak but its forgivable as it allows you to see a side of Harry that hasn't been seen in a long while. It opens him up to more feelings and truly allows for sympathy when things go bad for him, and particularly the end. So, to me, it was quite forgivable as I saw why they used it.Aside from those issues, I disagreed with many of the other critiques that I've read. I don't find the comic aspects disheartening, they were done well, but from the reviews I thought it would be light on the serious and dramatic content of the films, ie, I wouldn't be emotionally invested in the characters this time around. That turned out to be false though, at least it was for me. The special effects were great, the action was great, the acting was great... but what really holds this film and makes it all feel worth it is the emotional attachment to its characters and the way it builds your feelings for them. All of these characters are flawed, some very seriously, but you care about what happens to them all and brings the first two films full-circle in terms of pretty much everything. It wraps up what's been done in the previous two and does some of those things even better.","62 out of 83 found this helpful.

Haden does make an excellent Marko/Sandman and plays his role well, but others do not. Grace isn't the most intimidating actor they could have gone for for Venom, making a very evil character a bit limp. Even the previously great Franco is transformed into something disappointing. Not only did they bypass Hobgoblin for the 'New Goblin', but giving him a snowboard glider (etc.) just showed that they were trying way too hard to make him cool. Howard as Gwen Stacy isn't too inspiring either, thankfully Simmons as Jameson is continued brilliance.It is ambitious in the introduction of three villains, perhaps only faulted by none of them particularly interlinking. Scenes do jump about a lot as each arc is continued. The Sandman arc is great though, and perfectly supported by the soundtrack. However Venom is not given nearly enough time, but that's probably a good thing, as it looks and sounds terrible.In comparison to the previous two Spider-Man installments, there seemed to be a backwards step in CGI action. Plus camera shots at times were poor, the type of things that take you out from the story.Known more for the subsequent memes than iconic scenes, badboy Peter Parker will always be infamous but utterly enjoyable.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

My vote goes to it being the ""best"" although I prefer Superman and Batman over Spidey in the superhero category, anyway. However, I did find this movie extremely entertaining. Silly? Yes, but it's a Marvel Comics cartoon-come-to-life, so anything goes. A little too long? Probably.....yet I was never bored watching this, and I - and I assume most people - certainly got their money's worth for action, special effects, cool villains, romance, sentiment, good vs. evil, revenge vs. forgiveness, etc. Even two main characters: Spider-Man and his pal Harry - both had two different personalities in this story. There is so much material packed into this movie, it almost too much for one sitting. The film can wear you out!.Myself, I thought ""The Sandman"" was the coolest part of this movie. I've read a few of the comic books and thought he was the most interesting of the villains so I was curious to see how he'd be presented in here. I was not disappointed. His scenes were awesome!This is a rare film: a ton of action and, at the end, a sincere message of forgiveness, not revenge, being the answer. Wow, is that refreshing to hear. Yes, the revenge is more fun......but never as satisfying. For a little over two hours of totally escapist entertainment, this fills the bill.","44 out of 59 found this helpful.

Whether you want to see it as a love triangle, or a retelling of ancient mythologies concerning revenge, betrayal and the ghosts of father figures, these three characters were introduced in the first movie's opening scenes, and it their dynamic that has driven the narrative ever sinceuntil now.While 'Spiderman 3' is by no means a bad movie, it is nowhere near as good as it should have been and fails to satisfy for the simple reason that Sam Raimi forgot what these movies were about. For the first movie, Raimi had the writing talents of David Koepp, one of the most successful screenwriters around. For the sequel, Pulitzer Prize winning Michael Chabon contributed to a screenplay written by the Oscar-winning Alvin Sargent. For the third installment, Raimi makes the all too common mistake of developing delusions of grandeur and feeling that he can take over the writing duties himself. Though Sargent is credited as a co-writer, it's clear from the mess of a screenplay that his input was limited. Raimi's screenplay forgets everything that the two previous movies stood for and were clearly moving towards, and abandon all dramatic consistency and cohesive storytelling in favor of redundant characters supplying equally redundant CGI set-pieces.'Spiderman 3' feels as though it was made by different people with a different vision. The emotional drama between Peter and Mary Jane, so carefully built over the last few years, becomes illogical soap opera theatrics. Harry becomes a leering painter of Impressionist masterpieces. Peter starts crying all the time and develops a 'Saturday Night Fever' obsession. Sandman is completely redundant, receiving no character development and vanishing as inexplicably as he arrived. Similarly, Eddie Brock serves absolutely no purpose in the movie other than to become Venom in the final scenes. Very little of New York or its citizens are involved in the story, which is claustrophobically self contained  there are barely two scenes in the newsroom and the citizens of New York rarely seem to be in real peril.Again, it needs saying that 'Spiderman 3' is by no means a bad film, but it does nothing to close out the trilogy or provide anything close to satisfying emotional or dramatic closure, the fault for which can only be laid, unfortunately, on Sam Raimi.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

My favorite part was when Spidey-Man says to Harry ""Look at little Goblin Jr., gonna cry?"" now that got me. I love how this movie expands on Peter's ""bully"" persona by just raising the meanness of what he says like when he sees that Eddie Brock forged a photo to make Spider-Man look bad and Pete says ""I'm gonna put some dirt in your eye."". And that only leads to him telling Brock he's trash and getting the idiotic fool fired from The Daily Bugle. And if you don't know what I mean when I talk about how the bully aspect of Peter shines more in this one, well in the first two he does things that Bully Maguire would do. For example in the first one where he says ""I missed the part where that's my problem."" and in the second where he gulfs down half a hot dog after seeing ambulance and police cars go by. But in the third installment he just goes all out and I love it.","21 out of 26 found this helpful.

Story - as always - is complex with not one but 3 villains to contend with but (unlike the last batch of Star Wars) you can actually follow the story. And that's saying something. Least interesting parts of the movie were the (very obviously) digitial flying/fighting scenes. It's a bit sad that with all the hundreds of millions thrown at the screen that it still looks fake. In its own way original Superman's effects were just as good - Just a different kind of fake. Digital extras stand out like a sore thumb.Best thing in this movie is Thomas Haden Church's Sandman. Best supervillian performance in a while. Credible, fearsome and very moving. Tobey Maguire also stretches some acting muscle, playing a bad guy and a psychotic '77 John Travolta. There's are some genuinely funny scenes. Didn't even recognise Bryce Dallas Howard. Was surprised to see she played Blondie when end credits rolled.Multimedia screening I attended garnered a round of applause at the end.

He also surpassed the first Green Goblin in my opinion. James Franco really stepped up his game again for this film and to me he was the best actor involved.Venom was brilliant to watch although he did only have a short time on screen, however i'm not sure we've seen the last of him (and I was one of the people saying he wouldn't be back). Sandman was just as good as I was hoping and overall it was a fun film to watch.If you didn't like the first two then I doubt that you'll like this one but if you did then you'll love it because it holds all of the same characteristics that we have come to expect from a Spider-Man film.Most of the plots were closed by the end of the film and I will say this last thing.

The CGI is quite good (although not perfect), the action sequences move at a breakneck speed and the villains are charismatic. At the same time there are unbearable lengths with sappy dialog (and no, this movie didn't have to be over two hours long!) and some really crappy acting.As much as Tobey Maguire seemed like an interesting pick for Spidey/Peter Parker at first, his performance in this one really makes you wish someone else had gotten the part in the first place. When he plays bad-boy Parker at some point in ""Spider-Man 3"" it's totally unbelievable and annoying. It's not solely his fault, though. That whole scene is completely exaggerated.The character developpment is a mess at times. Characters swith from good to evil to sick to good again without any logic, just so at the end the right characters can be killed or die a heroic death that also rids them of any guilt they had brought upon themselves earlier on.Among the whole big name-cast, the special effects and the spectacular action sequences, the hidden highlight is once again Bruce Campbell, who has a ""Fawlty Towers""-esquire little cameo here.The main flaw for fans is probably that Venom, the one villain they waited for the most, doesn't get enough screen time and yes, it's true that the main villain, Sandman, just isn't very interesting. It would have been a good idea not to cram so many different story lines into this sequel, but to concentrate on one of them and flesh it out carefully.As it is ""Spider-Man 3"" is certainly no improvement over its predecessors but it's still quite entertaining.

Not without its problems but surely this is quite definitely the popcorn entertainment movie of the year. Upon immediate completion of the movie I was torn because I was aware that what I had just watched was indeed a great entertainment movie but I was ever so slightly disappointed because of the inevitable comparison to the second movie of the series which remains the best of the bunch by far. First lets start with the acting. Tobey Maguire is quite clearly having fun with the character this time around. He gets to delve a little more with Peter Parker's negative sides. We see a more confident (bordering on complacent) Peter Parker and Maguire suits this change in the character. Maguire gives great credibility to the character despite some very foul overacting when Peter turns 'bad'. However, Maguire still looks and sounds incredibly like Peter Parker. Kirsten Dunst does a rehash of the character from the first two movies. J.K. Simmons is as always hilarious and all the scenes with him are loaded with charm and humor and he truly steals every scene he is in. James Franco returns as Harry Osborn and this movie is truly his swan-song. He produces the greatest acting I have seen from him yet and he makes his character truly interesting to watch and his personal enigmas are at the very least as interesting as Parker's. Thomas Haden Church is one of the new additions to the cast. He is Sandman a lowly thug who by mere chance gets powers that make him almost unbeatable. Unfortunately he doesn't get that much character to work with and Sandman becomes just a reason to show off some admittedly awesome special effects. He only shows his talent by the very end of the movie (you'll know when you see it). Topher Grace gets the honor of playing the arguably most beloved villain in the entire Marvel universe, Venom and surprisingly he's very good. I was a little worried when I heard he had been hired to play Venom because of his history of comedic parts but he turns out to have dramatic flair as well. I have to admire Sam Raimi's guts for hiring such a new name for the part. Grace works hard and it shows. Eddie Brock Jr. becomes a very likable character and that is almost to his credit alone. Story wise the film is solid if a bit uneven. The pace is like in the previous movies well structured and there are very few slow points. The films primary strength is the central conflict with Peter, Mary-Jane and Harry Osborn because this part is very well told and filled with tension and emotion. The dialog is like in the previous movies not always completely believable but that hardly matters taking the source material into consideration. The new characters are introduced well enough if a bit hastily and this is the films primary flaw. There are simply too many characters to keep track of and unfortunately this means we do not get nearly as much of Venom and Sandman as we should have. And since we are on the subject of villains I should say that Venom is every bit as menacing as he should be. He proves to be more than a match for Spider-Man and that is the way it was in the comics so kudos to Mr. Raimi for that. However, my primary grudge with the entire movie is that Venom simply isn't enough in it. Had it been up to me I would have split the movie in two. By that we would have gotten more screen time for Sandman who would then have become a much better villain. Also it would have given us the opportunity to get Venom as a primary villain in a possible fourth movie. Effects wise the movie is of course breath taking. We see some of the most spectacular action sequences ever committed to celluloid and taking the film's budget into account that is hardly surprising. The action and effects in the previous movies were spectacular but in this one they go completely over the top and I for one enjoy this development. It somehow brings the movie closer to the source material and I have always claimed that this is what the series needed to do to attract the hard core fans. The end sequence is simply stunning and indeed a very worthy finale. Comparing the effects to the other big summer movie event, Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, I would say that Spider-Man comes out on top as the effects are nothing short of groundbreaking.Christopher Young was chosen to compose a score instead of Danny Elfman after Elfman and Sam Raimi had a falling out at some point while making the score for the second film and while he did produce a decent score it is by no means memorable like the scores from the previous movies. However, credit must be given where credit is due for Danny Elfman casts quite a shadow and the score is adequately bombastic and grand for a super hero movie of this kind of scale.Spider-Man 3 is a great summer movie but try not to judge it by the standards set by the second movie because it does not add up. All in all, however, Spider-Man 3 is a fantastic movie loaded with special effects and a good story. I know that the Spider-Man movies have generated a lot of money and there will in all probability be a fourth Spider-Man movie and I for one welcome the prospect because I believe that there are a lot more stories from the Spider-Man universe that deserves a chance to be seen on the big screen.

OK I'm going to mention the plot as little as possible for fear of any spoilers but I will presume that people have seen the trailer.This is a bold third instalment by Raimi in so much that it really does not rely on any key action scenes or set pieces to maintain interest. Indeed like the first two the film is very much character driven, but importantly a much darker and essentially more fun side of Spidey is seen here, which reminded me of aspects of Superman 3. All three of the bad guys are excellent particularly Thomas Hayden Church as the Sandman. Compared to the previous films the baddies occupy much less screen time particularly Venom, which I imagine people will miss, indeed Peter Parkers psyche is much more under scrutiny than before.Stan Lee has a nice little cameo, and Bruce Campbell has a scene stealing turn as an hilarious Maitre D, which unfortunately ends too soon. The CGI barring a couple of odd moments is generally excellent and like every Hollywood film these days at least 15 minutes could be cut off this. Slight catty comment here, but Kirsten Dunst really was not looking particularly good in the second half of this film, presumably this was deliberate maybe to subvert the expectations of the babe girlfriend, which in itself was a nice change.It would be nice for the series to go out on a high, but I see Spiderman 4 has already been announced, but to be honest I'm not really sure where else the series can go and keep its high standard.","22 out of 45 found this helpful.

I've studied this in some detail in the film business. Its a mundane insight and I won't bore you with it.Let's just say that of all the superhero movies, this one has the most possibilities for giving us exciting dimensional vision. ""King Kong"" did it, and I saw some titillating motions in another WETA project, ""Van Helsing."" And there was some promise in the last Spiderman's fight with Ock. And its not as if dull studios can't do dimensional: just watch that first chase in ""Casino Royale.""But this is as pure a cinematic waste as I've experienced, so let's talk about why it fails and why it appears not to.Film is a matter of assembly across different worlds. There's the central world of the embodiment anchored by the actors of course, and there's the world of the cinematic cosmos, how the world works and the eye we borrow behaves in it. On these two armatures are assembled all sorts of bits that each are placed individually but that we seldom see as bits. What we are meant to see is the overall organism, the being of the thing.There are only two ways for this to emerge. Either you use convention or you rely on some coherent orchestration, usually from one mind. Here it is mere convention and why this is ordinary, even ordinarily ordinary. I've given up on Raimi, and so apparently have all his talented collaborators: Dykstra, Elfman the most obvious. He's the new Verhoeven.He's interested in events and not circumstance. Snapshots (as is Jonah Jameson) instead of story; parts instead of assemblies. Its film-making 101, this, that real film is not about independent panels like a comic book. There's motion involved. That motion has to behave in accordance with and at the same time define and illustrate the world we see and the dynamics of how we see it. Those rules of motion are negotiated over time between us and the filmmakers, and constitute an evolving vocabulary. What he have here is the cinematic equivalent of two hours or ""you know"" and other such automatic, meaningless utterances. Part of what we pay for is this game, and under normal circumstances the question we decide is whether we want sugar or meat. Here we get cardboard.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.","15 out of 28 found this helpful.

Tobey Maguire's portrayal of Peter Parker remains solid, and the film editing keeps the story moving at a brisk pace, although it juggles multiple plotlines. The film's strength lies in its exploration of the consequences of power and vengeance, with the symbiote-infused Peter Parker providing an intriguing character arc. However, it falters with a somewhat cluttered narrative, too many villains, and occasional tonal shifts. The music adds to the film's emotional depth, and the cinematography captures the kinetic energy of Spidey's web-slinging with flair. ""Spider-Man 3"" may not reach the heights of its predecessors, but it's an okay installment that explores the dark side of heroism while providing moments of web-slinging excitement for fans.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, it is one of those 'hate it or love it' movies. The story is very complex, but the incredible visuals (including all the actors being very good looking) make up for it...a little bit. All in all, Spider-Man 3 might disappoint some, but there are those who will have a great time. Don't go in with high expectations...just sit back and enjoy the ride.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) appears to have finally found balance in his life. He is in love with the girl of his dreams, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), and all of New York loves his alter ego, Spider-Man. Despite this beautiful scenario, trouble lurks ahead. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), the man actually responsible for Uncle Ben's death, has escaped from prison and genetically combined with sand particles, and Harry Osborn (James Franco) is plotting his revenge against Peter/Spidey for the murder of his father. To make matters worse, Peter and MJ's relationship is threatened by other people (including Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy), and there is a competing photographer at the Daily Bugle named Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a young man with a venomous future ahead of him because of an alien symbiote that has landed on Earth, eventually taking over Peter's suit and changing him as a person...confusing, ain't it?As always, Spider-Man 3 is very well casted. I'll start off with our returning 3 stars, Maguire, Dunst, and Franco. Maguire needed to show even more acting muscle this time around, as Peter changes drastically throughout the movie. He pulls it off well, and some scenes are so different from the Peter we know to the point of extreme laughter. Aside from that, Maguire captures the often changing personality of Peter with ease, and gives a great performance. Kirsten Dunst gives her best performance as MJ, but she still isn't really that likable, which is a shame because MJ is supposed to be a character the audience loves just like Spider-Man. She has her moments, however. James Franco is extremely likable in the film, even though he is a villainous character. You'll identify more with Harry than you will with Peter, and I'm not the only one who liked him more than Peter. Franco's performance is layered and unpredictable (except the end), very similar to Willem Dafoe in Spider-Man 1. Thomas Haden Church is also likable, and he hopes people like him because he must've worked out for a century to transform from a scrawny middle aged man to a very cut and muscular man. He transforms into the Sandman, a villain that isn't really popular, but his inclusion really allows for some phenomenal effects that will blow you away. I'm sure filming that part was a pain. My favorite performance of the film was Topher Grace as Eddie Brock, and eventually Spider-Man's arch-nemesis, Venom. Grace is sickeningly sarcastic in the character, and when he does become Venom, will be scary. He gets some of the best lines in the whole film. Grace nailed the role when so many people doubted him, and I'm really happy with the way he played Venom. Definitely one of the most unforgettable bad guys of recent memory. Bryce Dallas Howard is also likable in limited screen time (maybe it's because she's absolutely beautiful). Dylan Baker has a slightly increased role as Dr. Connors, and his involvement in this film (you'll get this next statement when you see the movie) leaves a small window of chance for another Spider-Man movie, because of the material that he keeps.The visuals are breathtaking, especially the climactic fight sequence, which incorporates almost all the main characters. The two main villains of the film are computer generated, and that is incredible because they really don't look like it. Venom especially. The detail added to each scene is remarkable. It's amazing what a flip or web shoot every now and then will do to improve your action sequences. The action is by far the strongest point of the film. The weakest is the writing. The brothers Raimi crammed way too much into this film. 3 villains plus all the inner turmoil Peter suffers is too much to keep track of in one 2 and a half hour film. That is another fault. The movie is way too long. It focuses too much on Peter and not Spider-Man, making it have moments where it'll seem like a chick flick because of all the relationship drama. Sam Raimi forgot to make a movie about a superhero. Instead we've got a movie about a guy who happens to be a superhero. I enjoyed all the acting and action, but the story was way too rushed and should have been spread over two movies. While Thomas Haden Church was good, the movie could have been made without the entire Sandman storyline. They could have left the Uncle Ben subplot alone, and given all that time (Sandman has by far the most screen time of any of the baddies) to the wonderful Topher Grace and Venom. It was really disappointing to see Venom go to waste like that. Because this route was taken, the stories behind Gwen Stacy and Eddie Brock are chopped and sadly nonexistent. Brock was turned from one of the most developed, dark, and three dimensional characters into a two dimensional sadistic crazy man with little motive, and the writers should be ashamed. That's Carnage, not Venom. Venom has very little screen time, and in my mind should have had his own movie to fight Spider-Man...after all, he is Spider-Man's worst enemy.Spider-Man 3 is a good film. It's definitely up there with the better comic movies, but it didn't reach my expectations. Due to some strong violence and the scary Venom, Spider-Man 3 probably isn't appropriate for kids 11 and under.7/10 --spy","88 out of 172 found this helpful.

It's unfortunate to say because I see what Raimi was trying to accomplish. Peter Parker is put into a position where he's become egotistical, and overconfident in himself. And that's affecting his relationship with his friends, his love life, and his superhero life.The BIGGEST weakness of this movie is that there are too many story lines, and because of that, the overarching theme and message of this movie is messy. The Harry Goblin storyline was under baked, the Sandman storyline was under baked, and the Venom Symbiote storyline was wasted potential. (Don't get me started on Emo Peter. I hate you internet memes...) If Sony didn't interfere, the movie would have faired so much better.

It is extremely shallow and disjointed. Here are just a few examples without spoiling anything:1. Peter and MJ's non-reaction to the thing that happens near them close to the beginning of the film. 2. Eddie Brock's attitude and line to Captain Stacy after the ""incident."" 3. The Butler. THE BUTLER!!!!!The dialog is atrocious. The action sequences are pretty good. I wish someone had given me the time codes for when the action sequences occur and I would have sat in the hallway until the times came up. I felt embarrassed for Topher Grace. I think he succeeded in making the best out of an extremely poorly written role. James Cromwell. Tobey did fine, but the director needs to remember that less (weeping) is more. (Future directors of Claire Danes, I'm talking to you.) Some of the emotion that Tobey was forced to create from thin air (due to the lousy script) also made me feel embarrassed for him. I fear that some of the odd choices he appeared to make were actually the fault of the editor or director, because several times I found myself asking, ""Why did his eyes just widen like crazy? Why is he making that face?"" James Franco did fine with poorly written dialog. Kirsten Dunst obviously knows where a body is buried. She emits zero honest emotion in her performance. I defy you to watch a scene from the first movie with your hand over her eyes and then distinguish any difference in the emotional output of her face. I WANT to like her. It's as if she's never gotten out of the line delivery from ""Interview with a Vampire."" Also, I'm sick of movies preaching to me. Desiring justice and being filled with revenge are NOT the same thing. Reacting to a violent attack with violence does not ALWAYS make the attacker and victim equally guilty of wrongdoing. Did you notice ""James Cromwell"" earlier in this paragraph? ""Why was he stuck in there?"" you might ask yourself. That's the same question you'll ask if you see this movie; such is the case with many poorly executed character arcs. Thank God for J.K. Simmons. The audience I saw this film with seemed relieved and appreciative to finally be hearing some good line delivery. Thanks J.K! Bruce Campbell also did a good job. Other comedy in Spider-man 3 feels so contrived that it cheapens the entire film. I'm not saying it's not funny, but...well, you'll see. You'll see when you no doubt pay to go see this film and you, like me, will probably have to look at your shoes during the scenes with some of the worst dialog since Jar Jar Binks.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

Everything with J Jonah Jameson is gold (as expected), most of the action satisfies, Bruce Campbell's cameo here is hilarious, and the concept of Spider-Man becoming cocky and letting his ego run rampant is an interesting and compelling contrast to how down in the dumps Peter was in Spider-Man 2.Some setpieces don't fare super well though- namely the first action sequence, which easily has the weakest special effects of any scene in the film, and as such makes a bad first impression. As every reviewer will also tell you, there's too many villains, and while some of the infamous Emo Peter I'm sure is supposed to be funny, I feel like a lot of it crosses into unintentionally hilarious.It's a messy but far from worthless ending to Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy.

In this part, the writers and director tried to pay attention to the inner, dark world of Peter Parker and at the same time made a huge number of enemies, so that the plot threads got mixed up and it was not possible to show the potential of the characters in full. But first things first:The first is the hero. Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man, is having a good time, his girlfriend is performing on Broadway, and city officials are giving him the key to the city. Everything is fine, criminals are even afraid to go outside. And the hero has no doubt whether he should be an ordinary man or a super hero, he can combine everything.Secondly, the villains. As mentioned above, there were too many of them. It is clear that Harry Osborn has not gone anywhere and his revenge has not cooled either, this is the strongest aspect of the plot, the theme of friendship and hatred, the director and screenwriters did not miss it and presented it as it should. Venom is the best villain in the history of Spider-Man. But the screen time of the main villain is too limited. Flint Marco is an escaped prisoner who killed Uncle Ben, this character is not that superfluous, he is connected with the plot, he was not poorly included, they made his story well, but there was already too many plotlines going on at once.Third is the film itself. Spider-Man 3 is a good film, but there are just too many storylines, too many events and characters, all of this is very difficult to comprehend, and especially to convey in two hours of screen time. From the point of view of pure entertainment, there are no complaints, as before, this is a well-made movie, with a lot of beautiful special effects. Still, it's a worthy conclusion to the trilogy.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Never having seen Spider-Man 3 at all, and hearing what I heard, I wasn't optimistic. There were accurate comments, and others who were unrealistic with their reviews. This movie had a fantastic base plot. Topher Grace is a huge pussy but, hey, so is Toby Maguire. So if you can get past the worst dance in movie history, this was a valid addition to the trilogy. Some of the CGI was questionable, I blame the saturation of characters. Too many people with too much maintenance, leaving major story arcs left most untouched. I just got a major feeling of deja vu from seeing the Batman franchise crash and burn after Batman & Robin. With Spider-Man 3 being far less of an atrocity there was still plenty of room for a Spider-Man 4. Now with Spidey joining the cinematic universe hopefully they can finally get it right.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The fact that this sequel is by far the worst of the Spider-Man trilogy is stated as an actual FACT. Just when I thought that there couldn't be more drama in the Spider-Man trilogy Sam Raimi proves me wrong! Sam forget the drama lessons you've learned at directors school, and focus on telling the story of Spider-Man properly. Watch the 90s animated series, and read comic book or two. You had a great Marvel francise, which would have been a great movie trilogy. But you've messed it up with all this drama junk! As a Spidey fan! I've got to say quit while your down!!

Yeah, Bully Maguire is a fantastic meme, but in this movie, it doesn't really work, yet it has some logic in it, but the execution isn't the most proper in this movie. So yeah, I respect the people who dislike this movie and I accept the fact that this is easily the worst of this exquisite trilogy, but in my opinion, it's good. Not great, not super-good or excellent, but still a solid comic-book movie. And yeah, I'm sad that the 4th installment didn't happen, because this trilogy had a lot of great moments and has a lot of fans. Instead, we got The Amazing Spider-Man and - ehm, ok I guess.

A decade has pass and now I'm start to see some people hating on this movie and it left me shock to see many people dislike it. I started to research to see why the movie was bad and I'll admit...it made some valid points. Too many villains in one movie, Eddie Brock and Venom, emo Peter, the writing, and probably more. I had to watch the trilogy again to understand it and I get the hate...and I still like the movie.To be honest, I think the memes from this movie just makes the movie more entertaining. What I like about the Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy is that each character has their own story. Most people don't like Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom, but to me, he seems more accurate to what Eddie Brock suppose to be and he represents the dark side of Peter. Some of these flaws, to me, actually help this movie.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

However Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)'s life is spiraling after a bad review gets her fired from her Broadway show. A new lady Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) comes into Peter's life. She's his fellow student and gets rescued by Spider-man. Harry Osborn (James Franco) still wants revenge as The New Goblin. Love complications abound for Peter when MJ gets jealous and Harry loses his memory then regains it back, only to blackmail MJ.There is more. Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is an escaped convict. When he gets caught in a experimental machine, he's transformed into the Sandman. Later Peter finds out that Flint is Uncle Ben's true killer. Also a black substance from a fallen meteor attach to Spider-man forming a symbiotic relationship. Spider-man becomes dark in more ways than just the color. Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is Gwen's boyfriend and a competitor for Peter's job as photographer. He's a little weasel. When Peter rips off the symbiont, it attach itself to Eddie Brock and he becomes Venom.There are just too many villains, and too much story. Director Sam Raimi struggles to squeeze everything in. It's hard to lay all the blame on Raimi, but he has to take on his share. It still has its entertaining moments. There is good action, and the new villains look great visually. Let's face it. When the villain gets amnesia then switches back and that's a side story, this thing is overstuffed. Also the tone of the movie is problematic. Bruce Campbell and J.K. Simmons are making childish campy fun. Tobey Maguire looks silly desperate to be believable as dark. That part is cringe-worthy. Topher Grace also overdoes his weasel character. Too many times, the movie goes into silly territories. The best thing in the movie is the theme of forgiveness. Peter Parker, Harry Osborn, and even MJ have to find their better angels as they escape their individual darkness. At least, all the stories have that connective tissue.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

Really, does anyone remember anything that Two-Face and Poison Ivy actually did? After building his rollicking action empire with tight, one-on-one contests between our friendly neighbourhood hero and his nemeses, Raimi falls into the trap of taking Spider-Man 3 a villain too far. It has nothing to do with the CG qualities of either Sandman or Venom (they're as well-rendered as you'd expect from the next instalment of an $800million franchise). It's simply that the film introduces so many problems for Peter Parker to deal with, it doesn't fully focus on any.On the verge of proposing to Mary Jane, Peter is so caught up in his own hype that he has become a self-absorbed prat. Outwardly, they're fine, but he is so busy enjoying the adulation and attention - hey, police chief's daughter Gwen Stacy, how YOU doin'? - that he's oblivious to any problems MJ might have.And anyway, there's also some unfinished business with Harry 'Goblin Jr' Osborne, cocky photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is after his job at the Bugle, and convict Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) is now a much bigger problem than when he first escaped after having his DNA replaced with sand. The guy's a walking building site.Then a black goo from outer space which feeds on human aggression (drug metaphor ahoy!) transforms Peter into a swaggering, greasy-fringed idiot - like a member of The Killers who's seen Saturday Night Fever too many times.But his turn to the dark side is reflected in the spider-suit's cool new look which is later adopted by Brock when the terrible treacle turns him into Venom. Let's get ready for a tag-team rumble Needless to say, it all looks fantastic. But, for all its impressive, whiplash-inducing set-pieces, jokey interludes, cute cameos (including Bruce Campbell as a Pythonesque maitre d') and general vertiginous pizazz, the plot regularly loses momentum.How many messages on commitment, redemption and doing the right thing does one film need? What's with the ridiculous climactic commentary from that TV reporter with the bad English accent and her geriatric, googly-eyed anchorman? Would Bryce Dallas Howard like to give me a call the next time she has this little to do in a movie? Like Spidey himself, Raimi appears to have gotten carried away by the success of his previous exploits. Webby 3.0 certainly gives you plenty of whiz-bang for your buck, but it doesn't get that spider sense tingling.","14 out of 28 found this helpful.

I was disturbed by some of the laughing from the audience at key points. There were a lot of moments in the movies that asked its audience for emotion. Maybe too many for some people. I felt like this required knowledge from the previous two movies. The characters were built really well through the three movies and I felt like this one had rights to ask emotion from us. I guess I can be a sappy guy or hopeless romantic. Whatever you want to call it. I did enjoy the movie throughly. I don't know if I gave it the emotion that Mr. Raimi was looking for. I was on the verge of tears at some point but just the verge. All in all I would say its worth the price of admission. Great action sequences and great build up of the characters. Don't know if we need another but I guess that will be up to Tobey, Kirstin, Sam and the rest.

Unfortunately, however, the action set-pieces are too dizzyingly-edited to be properly evaluated; still, the high-rise stunt early on and the climactic battle of the mutants are undeniably spectacular.Besides, the complicated plot results in gross overlength - featuring yet another round of the Tobey Macguire/Kirsten Dunst/James Franco love triangle, too many adversaries for Spider-man (with allegiances shifting frequently and unconvincingly), and a baffling insistence on the deaths of the Willem Dafoe and Cliff Robertson characters from the first film! A platinum blonde Bryce Dallas Howard brings some much-needed freshness to the proceedings - though her role, ultimately, proves of little consequence.The Sandman's back-story is especially ludicrous and sentimental with an utterly wasted Theresa Russell as his resentful wife; Venom, however, is interesting (especially in the way he represents Spider-man's alter ego) - but comes to the fore far too late into the game: his demise is nicely handled, too, but it's then ruined by the apparent necessity to eliminate the Topher Grace character. The scenes involving the 'Evil Peter Parker' swagger, then, are eye-rollingly embarrassing, as is the musical number sung by Dunst during her disastrous Broadway stint! The film allows Bruce Campbell yet another delightful cameo, and there's even a wonderful bit involving Spider-man co-creator Stan Lee. In the end, SPIDER-MAN 3 succeeds mainly as a slick and solidly entertaining ride (as long as one doesn't analyze it too deeply).","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

With abilities that all of us would like to have,Spidey gathered millions of fans as the years came by. The Story was captivating,the Villains tough,the Moves Cool and Mary Jane nice.Spider-Man represented the superhero in all of us.He wasn't an alien from another planet,he wasn't a rich businessman,but the Guy next door.The Shy Guy,that rarely talks and is considered boring,but that when the moment comes,changes his personality and his alter ego saves the day.Yes,Spider-Man came closer to teen fans more than the other superheroes exactly because of this:He was just a student,with lots of problems,exactly like most of his readers.Years passed and the period when superheroes started appearing on the big screen came. Due to the complexity of Spidey's moves,every attempt to create a Spider-Man movie failed.All Up to 2002,when at last a man took Up the Challenge. This man was Sam Raimi(the director of The Evil Dead).The timing was right,since this is the age of special effects and almost everything can now be turned into a movie,and thus the movie was a success for a first try and fans were pleased.2 Years Later,Spider-Man 2 was even better,with more action and a greater villain.However,it was clear the the first two movies were just warming up. Raimi hadn't unleashed his best yet. Now he has.Spider-Man 3 isn't only a great sequel,it's the best Spider-Man ever.The reasons are obvious. We got even more action-packed scenes. The story is as good as the ones before.All actors give good performances and manage to bring,yet again,the comic book to life.Tobey Maguire IS Spider-Man/Peter Parker and Kirsten Dunst is lovely as MJ. Bryce Dallas Howard makes a hot appearance as Gwen Stacy,Parker's 2nd love interest. All this and a Cameo from Bruce Campbell(Ash from The Evil Dead)makes the movie nice.But those reasons are not enough to make it more special than the other Spider-man movies.What is it Then?The Villains of course! How can't a Spider-Man movie be good,since it features 3 villains at the same time?We got Spidey's childhood friend Harry Osborn,who follows in the footsteps of his father and becomes the evil Hobgoblin(or New Goblin as mentioned on IMDb) and makes the skies insecure as he flies menaciously.Then we Got the Evil Sandman,who makes for a great enemy. How can u beat a man made out of sand,who can regenerate every part of his body? Well,you'll have to find out in cinemas.But the show is truly stolen by the Great Venom! Combined with an alien symbiotic costume,Eddie Brock finally becomes Spider-Man's strongest(and scariest)enemy.Almost all the merit for the greatness of this movies goes to him. Ever since I first saw Venom in the animated television series,I couldn't help but doubt and dream how would he be in a possible movie.At last my wish came true. Venom looked awesome on screen,I couldn't have imagined him better. He will surely be this year's best CGI character.To Sum Up,Spider-Man 3 is not only one of this summer's best movies,it is also the best Spider-Man yet.Fans of Spider-Man 3,watch this movie and you won't be disappointed.With Venom finally alive,this movie is Not to Be Missed.","10 out of 20 found this helpful.

They have completely destroyed it. The script is extremely weak. The actions are nowhere near expectations - in fact, I found myself growing impatient wondering when the next action scene would be. 90% of the time in this movie focused on the characters' emotions which failed to deliver anyway. I felt no sympathy, no emotion, just itchiness of wanting to leave the cinema. I walked into the cinema expecting actions and good fun, or at least a good strong script. I did not want to go in there to listen to tasteless words, to watch stretchy scenes (that were supposed to be meaningful but were oh so disappointing), or to witness a directing disaster such as of the scene where Spider Man danced in the Jazz Bar. It was HORRIBLY directed, just terrible! I could not bare the last 5 minutes of the movie. I just wanted it to end right away because I didn't want walk out on something I paid for. I guess everyone else felt the same because the minute the credits started to roll, EVERYBODY stood up at the same time like there was fire under everyone's bottom.We left the cinema feeling frustrated, cheated, misled by the trailer, and, we couldn't leave the cinema fast enough.","41 out of 78 found this helpful.

"","","An amusement suffering by comparison with its predecessor.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1645241/?ref_=tt_urv","JohnDeSando","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1391596/?ref_=tt_urv","28 April 2007","Like a middle-aged man on a mission, Spider-Man 3 sags in the middle, takes a while to get somewhere, but still likes the girls, swells a progress or two, and shows some of the old idealism that fights with maturity's pragmatism. Most disappointing of all is this pre-mid-life hero, Peter Parker, aka Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire), obsessed with his love, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), and his desire to marry her.Enough already. He needs to save New York from the Sandman (an interesting new villain played by a fine actor, Thomas Haden Church) and Venom (Topher Grace). Director Sam Raimi, who knows a thing or two about split-personality Spider-Men and the evil forces overcoming good men with his Simple Plan, indulges his melodramatic longings through most of the film's mid section with the endless exchanges between Peter and MJ.Raimi does do well with the dueling good and evil theme, starting with Peter's sudden change brought on by black globs from another world. When he supposedly eliminates the Sandman for murdering his uncle, Peter is confounded by his will to do it and his moral compass, which keeps getting into his conscience. Even the Sandman struggles between his devotion to his little girl and acting like King Kong to scare the heck out of Manhattanites. Raimi does a service to the youngsters of the audience by stressing the importance of choices, a kind of comic-book existentialism.But Marvel Comics and Stan Lee live on. Yet, at 139 minutes (12 more minutes than SM2), SM3 is 39 minutes too long, notwithstanding the outstanding FX. SM 2 was much better, not just because Pulitzer-winner Michael Chabon was one of the writers, but because it took Doc Ock (Alfred Molina) so seriously he seemed to have more lines than Dunst, who here is petulant and self-centered enough to lose my interest. As I wrote in 2004, Spider-Man 2 ""is a movie to draw you firmly and forever into its warm web, even more than the original did."" SM3 is an add on, an amusement suffering by comparison with its predecessor.","14 out of 30 found this helpful.

It had a bunch of action and thin story. It butchered the series for me. I glad to announce this film didn't have the same affect. I was more wary this time, yes, but also still excited. The writers handled the story very well and there was plenty of eye popping action. Still the film lacked a good strong drive like its predecessor.I will address the short comings first. I will point out the obvious. Kirsten Dunst can't sing very well, but that is addressed in the film. The thing is that we have to hear her sing twice, a very bad idea. It wasn't the most pleasant thing to hear although she is decent. My next point of minuses is the origin of the symbiote. It just falls from the sky. A rather weak way for it magically appear, but they had few options other than go with the Ultimate origin where it is man-made. Still little more cause for its arrival would have made it stronger. My third and final point is in regards to the final ending. It was needed at all and added nothing to the progression of the characters other than for a happier note to end on.Now onto the positive stuff of which there is a mass. First the stupendous battles, and let me tell there are some big ones. They were very well staged and brought to being. The final battle especially did a great job of bringing everything together. The special effects are dazzling especially Sandman. The first appearance of his is pure film magic as we see the cells change in Marko's body and the reconstruction after being turned into sand particles. Venom was great to, but nothing spectacular aside from the ""Alien"" moments.Before I go on praising this film I will provide a brief description of the plot. Picking up from where the other film left off, MJ and Peter have finally gotten together and things are looking fantastic for Spider-Man and Parker as he has the girl of his dreams and has the city on his sides even the newspaper, a shocker. But things quickly go south when Harry Osborne swoops in and tries to kill Parker as revenge because he believes Spider-Man/Parker's to be the murderer of his father. He looses not only the battle, but his memory after taking a few nasty hits. Flint Marko is then brought on the scene as a misunderstood runaway convict. Through crazy chance he falls into a test area and is turned into the Sandman. Parker is mad at Marko at this point because he believes him to be the true murderer of his Uncle Ben. I won't reveal much more, but Venom/Eddie Brock does have a pretty big part in the last section of the film as does the symbiote about half way and a little before when it falls from the sky. All in all, it is a nice setup for some serious encounters/fights.The relationship between Mary Jane and Peter Parker is pretty key to the film as it drives much of Peter's personal decisions and problems. It's done quite well, aside from Mary Jane singing. Peter wants to ask her to marry him, but it doesn't work out. Aunt May has some great moments in here where she really shines. Everyone is back and more. Jameson is as steaming mad as ever and provides quite a few laughing fits involving his temper. Even the great theme is used to great affect from beginning to ending, something that was sorely missing in the last X-Men film.The film is one of the best entries in the series, but not quite up to Spider-Man 2 which was pitch perfect and never stumbled for a moment. It successfully engages three villains with Spider-Man/Peter Parker, but it doesn't quite resolve everything as grandly as Spider-Man 2 did. Still far from a disappointment which is sure to please most everyone action wise and for those romantic fans it will frustrate you.","19 out of 44 found this helpful.

If the audience cares about the characters the effects just enhance the experience. I am a fan of the comics. So it is suffice to say don't go to this movie expecting a concrete copy of the characters comic lives. What Taimi has done is capture the soul of the characters. Peter Parker is interesting because he continues to have problems. Not just the enemies he faces but the enemies within. I felt that the first films theme was responsibility, the second film's theme was choices, and this new movies theme is about forgiveness. This is what I love about this film though it is dark the hero still manages to rise up and face what ever odds are against him. Each character is important and the villains are delightful. Definitely a 10/10.We are in rare territory where a entire trilogy is continues to impress.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

And it's also true we pounce to criticize them with harsh cruelty when they fail to meet our expectations. 'Spiderman 3' is a perfect summer blockbuster at its own credit. But it has got two wonderful movies as its prequels... so, it faces a tough challenge.Three villains... one of them my favorite - Venom. Where the movie really fails is its attempts to show the backgrounds of all three of them. OK, the goblin needs no background. But Venom gets the least screen time and I'm not satisfied. A good villain needs time to grow... See, all of the major Spidey villains have their brighter pasts from where they slowly transform to villains. In this film this transformation is hurried and shown abruptly, which quite kills the movie's mood. I believe the film wastes more time on Sandman than it needed.Another major aspect of the film is Peter Parker's alter ego as the black spiderman after he's infected by the symbiote. I loved the sequence in the jazz club for sure, but I also think the character is shown overtly egomaniacal and unnecessarily irritating. Maguire tries hard to create the contrast between the real Peter and the infected Peter and thus in both cases, he over-acted. Along with his acting, several scenes are also written with excessive emotions and often they are laughable.But, there are also numerous bright points in the film of course. I just loved the use of humor in this film... especially in scenes involving JK Simmons and Bruce Campbell. And the special visual and sound effects are awesome, you know, as they should be. The fighting sequences, though not very innovative, but always fun to watch. The overall acting is not bad... with James Franco and Topher Grace both stealing the show.So, to wrap it up, one would definitely enjoy the film. But every time I think about Spidey2, I compare them... and this one somehow loses.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

Part two was had a lot of merit, but Spidey 3 is just an effective marketing job and Sam Raimi has finally yielded to the pressure of the movie's backers. The fake melodrama, especially towards the end, makes your stomach turn. No amount of CGI can make up for a poor plot line. Both Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst were on the BBC to plug the movie. Then it was already obvious that Mary Jane's part would be disproportionately inferior to that of Spiderman's. Actually, nearly all the good scenes in the movie occur when Spiderman meets his dark side. It was kind of fun rooting for the bad guy. The rest of the picture was far too cheesy.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

"","","Worst Film of 2007, or the new Milena?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1677750/?ref_=tt_urv","GrantKanigan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10350035/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2007","It's sad to see a great trilogy end so horribly. That is, if Spiderman 3 is the end of the series, (i.e., it has made so much money another sequel may already be in the works). Spiderman 3 is not only the worst film in the series; it is one of the worst films of the new millennium. The third outing in the otherwise excellent film series centers around an assortment of characters; Peter Parker, (Tobey Maguire), and his acceptance of being a hero loved by New York, Mary Jane Watson, (Kirsten Dunst), and her anxiety of being a failure as an actress, Harry Osborne, (James Franco), and his obsession with killing Peter, Eddie Brock, (Topher Grace) a photographer compelled to take Peter's job, and Flint Marko, (Thomas Haden Church), a criminal that turns out to be the man who really killed Peter's Uncle Ben in the first Spiderman film. The intimidating cast of characters seems to be too much at first, and in the end, it still is. There is too much time spent on introducing the characters and getting to know them that the plot loses screen time to the characters. There are about 5 more main players in the film that I haven't mentioned already, but if I tried to explain them this whole review would be filled with names and pointless plot lines. Sadly, in a stellar cast, only three actors show their excellent acting abilities, in little screen time; Bruce Campbell (of the cult film Army of Darkness from the Evil Dead trilogy), who plays a gut-busting Maître d' at a French restaurant, Thomas Haden Church, (Sideways), as not so much of a villain but more of a lost soul in a role as a criminal and villain Sandman, and Topher Grace, (That 70's Show's Eric Foreman), as an aspiring photographer whose hate eventually turns him into the infamous Spiderman villain Venom. One of the films major downfalls is its ridiculous plot. The most important element of the plot, the black ooze that turns Peter from normal to evil, and Topher Grace's character into venom, comes from an asteroid that falls out of the sky. To showcase how evil this makes Peter, the filmmakers put makeup on him, have him strut through New York snapping his fingers and eyeing women for nearly fifteen minutes all while wearing his ""evil-spidey"" black outfit underneath his clothes. What is supposed to be funny turns out to be dumb, tedious, and irrelevant, ultimately killing any chance of the film being good enough to view more than once. There is so much wrong with this film that I could fill up all of Rolling Stone with its failures. I hated this film. Even if you loved the first two films, Spiderman 3 is boring, brainless and not worth seeing. Ever. Let me put it this way; instead of dumbing down the plot to get to the widest audience, the plot is so dumb it may actually lower the audience's IQ.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

That is if I make a comparison between Spider-Man 3 and Spider-Man 2. But regardless of comparison, Spider-Man 3 is not a bad movie. It just isn't great, that's all.The movie began with a lengthy title intro, throwing in snippets from the movie Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2, which left me with a bad feeling to how things will turn out. The intro wasn't well done. It was quite shabby, even lazy if to put it more harshly. Aesthetically speaking it wasn't impressive.It was like as if portraying the way Peter Parker a.k.a Spider-Man is living his life after being celebrated as the city's hero. Life is good, so good that our hero has forgotten his place and purpose. Spider-Man, in this latest from the franchise is missing its spunk. It has forgotten what made it great. I'm talking about having the audience emotionally touched by Peter Parker's struggle, having mind-blowing actions that leaves the audience in awe, and the impact of the dialogues that inspires.My suspect is that the filmmakers tried to put too much into this movie. There must be something somewhere that went amiss producing it.Let me explain. While the main focus of the film revolves around our hero's disposition from fighting the darkness that exists in him, there were too many sub-plots that took away and undermine it. There was the love story between Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). There was the meaning of friendship between Peter Parker and Harry Osborn (James Franco). There was Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) being linked to the murder of Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). And there was Venom (Topher Grace).With so many motives to act out, it is inevitable that the film would fall short. There are too many pieces in this puzzle too trying to piece together in one film, despite its length. The tempo is really slow right from the start. If not for the hilarious-ness of some scenes, with quite a few notably of James Jameson (J.K. Simmons), Peter's boss at the Daily Bugle, the movie can be considered rather dry for a comic genre film.Sandman and Venom, the main villains, were not well depicted. There were supposed to be much more about them, yet in the film they were reduced to just mere bad guys with bad luck that ultimately led them to become Spider-Man's foe. Character play is weak.It is agonizing to see Spider-Man 3 following X-Men 3's path of condensing story lines and mixing in Superman Returns's mellow love story attempt. This is not the best formula for an inspirational Superhero movie.The last fight sequence toward the end where Spider-Man battles Sandman and Venom though became the savior for this Superhero film. Thank goodness for it.All in all, ""With great power comes great responsibilities"" wasn't that great. But I'll like to agree with this message that Spider-Man 3 brings and that is in life we are given choices, some will lead to good and some will be bad. When confronted can you do the right thing?Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) told Peter Parker in the film, ""Do yourself a favor by first doing the most difficult thing, forgive yourself.""All of us had made choices in our lives. For all those that went wrong, there is no longer anything we can do about them, but we can always learn from them so we can make right choices in time to come.At least that part in Spider-Man 3 is right. ""May"" Spider-Man 4 be ""right"" after 3.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

His girlfriend Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) is the lead star of a musical show in Broadway, and he wants to propose her. After defeating Harry ""New Goblin"" Osmond (James Franco), Harry is hit on the head, has amnesia and they become friends again. Meanwhile, the smalltime crook Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who had actually killed Peter's uncle, escapes from prison and is accidentally submitted to an experiment in a sand pit of a laboratory, transforming in the Sandman. Peter Parker is also threatened in his job by the new ambitious photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). His life turns upside down when an alien being is attached to him, increasing his aggressiveness and his dark side. Harry recalls his last memories and decides to destroy Peter; the jealous Mary Jane breaks out with him; the alien Venon bonds to Eddie, increasing his revenge wish; and the Sandman wants to destroy the Spider Man.""Spider-Man 3"" is not as good as the other two previous movies, but it is also a great film. The characters change their attitudes along the story, with Peter Parker beginning silly and fascinated, showing off his ""Tom Cruise"" hidden side, and returning to a balanced man in the end and capable to forgive. Harry Osmond begins revengeful, and I just question why his butler only discloses the truth about the death of his father in the very end. Flint Marko is a complex character, presented as a cold blood killer in the beginning and ending as a desperate father with bad luck. The special effects are top-notch; there are many stunning action scenes and the final message about choices is very positive. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Aranha 3"" (""Spider-Man 3"")","23 out of 34 found this helpful.

In almost every aspect it was overstated, leaving the audience no room/need/desire (delete as appropriate) to interpret/appreciate situations for themselves. When a director has to cut to a (bad) English accent yelling ""I don't know how much more of this he can take"" to tell you that the protagonist's taking a spanking you really have to question the quality of a production.Sure, a lot of money has been spent on special effects, but they fail to serve as more than eye candy... I didn't feel drawn into the action scenes at any point. The only genuine reaction the film pushed out of me was a slight jump when the goblin grabbed MJ.There was plenty of plot I suppose, but none of it convincing or engaging- the characters were entirely selfish and unlikeable (not necessarily a bad thing in a movie, but hardly appropriate for a light superhero film) and deviated so wildly from their templates that I simply didn't see the link to their comic book namesakes by the end. Venom's potential as a foe was utterly wasted, not because of a villain overload- 3 bad chaps is perfectly doable- but because it was barely addressed as a character or an idea. The only information we received as the Symbiote were a couple of statements Parker's teacher plucks from thin air.Instead of exploring the themes of Spiderman and his opponents, or even just giving fun action, we were given two and a half hours of Peter Parker acting like a turd. Even that was over-baked. I cringed, I despaired, I regretted the fact that I've already signed down to see it on a staff social tomorrow as well.Truly lamentable.","17 out of 29 found this helpful.

Both these movies had very good acting, excellent writing, and great choreography and action. But what made both these movies so good was the fact that they were very well paced, had just one antagonist, and had a lot of drama.Spiderman 3 was my absolute ""must watch"" film for the year. However, after the first hour or so, I was getting more and more disappointed.The acting wasn't fantastic. Good performances by most of the cast, but Tobey and Dunst (who happen to be the most important), weren't as good. The writing was done well, especially the comedy, but towards the end I thought there was just too much. You want to laugh a little, but you don't want Spiderman to turn out as a comic. That's where this movie fell flat for me.The pacing was terrible. The build up as good, and the entire climax and all the post movie drama happen in no more than 15 minutes. It's as though the movie just suddenly races past, and then immediately stops. Just like this review.6/10","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Sure, you could spend all day picking faults with the film if you really wanted to, but what's the point? The first two films set the bar very high for comic book movies, and this film is not a disappointment considering what went before it. I have to say that I'm not a 'Spiderman fanboy' and have, in fact, not even read the comics; but that is testament to the brilliance of Sam Raimi's vision as he has managed to turn Spider-Man into a franchise that is accessible to everyone. The plot this time around is far more complex than in the last two. Spider-Man's celebrity status has grown among the people of New York City. His private life is going well also. However, good things never last long; and Spider-Man is about to face a threat from his former best friend Harry Osborne who wants revenge for the death of his father, as well as a 'simian' life form from another planet and the return of his uncle's killer, this time in the guise of powerful new villain 'Sandman'.The most outstanding thing about this film is definitely the special effects. The fight scenes are brilliantly realised, and Sam Raimi certainly knows how to put a thrilling compilation together. The Sandman provides Spider-Man 3 with its best visuals, as the Terminator 2-style villain switches between sand and flesh in style, and the director constantly makes good use of this set-up. The visuals are obviously important in a film like this, and the film contains many a memorable scene. The best of these sequences come in the form of the creation of the villains, and while it has to be said that the way they come about is a little convenient (Sandman stumbles upon a nuclear experiment with sand...), it's not too difficult to believe since the film takes place in a world where a human/spider hybrid fights criminals in New York City. Popular Spider-Man villain Venom makes an appearance also, albeit it a brief one. However, the way that his character is built up makes up for the lack of screen time that the resulting villain has.One of the most common problems viewers have picked out with this film is the fact that there are a lot of different plot lines going on. It's true that the film does become more than a little bit complex and the new characters suffer as a result of that. But the Spider-Man Universe is obviously a vast one, and Sam Raimi had a lot on his plate when it came to writing a story that would please the fans, stay true to the comics and entertain the audience. He actually juggles the numerous plot threads very well, as most of the points get across and the impending plot holes aren't enough to spoil anyone's enjoyment. Sam Raimi's sense of humour is brilliant, it was obvious that the likes of J.K. Simmons and B-movie legend Bruce Campbell were going to provide comic relief (and they do), but the funniest thing about the film for me was Peter Parker's reaction to the black suit. In a sequence that seems to be rather widely disliked, Spidey goes from geeky physics student to a (sort of) suave lady-killer with hilarious results. The sequence shows a lot more imagination than many directors would have given the idea of a superhero turned 'dark'.The acting is largely decent also. The returning characters all give performances that you would expect from there, while the new additions fit in well. Thomas Hayden Church pretty much sleepwalks through his role, but he's still an asset to the film as he completely looks and feels like he has come straight out of a comic book! Topher Grace is slimy and irritating as he should be, and the sequence immediately before he changes into Venom says a lot about his character. Overall, Spider-Man 3 is not exactly a perfect film - but it's certainly an entertaining one and I know for sure that I'll be seeing it again!","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

There is such a plethora of characters, plot lines, villains and monsters - all vying for attention and getting in each others' way in the process - that the movie feels as if it has been assembled by a committee rather than having arisen from a single artist's organic vision.The ostensible selling point of ""Spider-Man 3"" is that the meek and mild-mannered Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) dons a mysterious black suit that suddenly turns him into a heartless, cranky bad guy. The suit, which is actually a creepy-crawly creature from outer space that changes the personality of whomever it clings to, is only one of four villains Spidey has to contend with here - in as clear a case of malefactor overload as we've encountered in quite some time. No wonder Spider-Man looks so worn out (we seriously thought it might just be the by-product of sequel-fatigue). The others foes include his friend, Harry Osborn, aka New Goblin (James Franco), who still believes Parker was responsible for his father's death; Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), the actual murderer of Parker's uncle who has been transformed into a giant killer sandman; and a cocky little newspaper photographer, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who is determined to snap a photo of Spider-Man doing something bad so as to tarnish the superhero's hitherto sterling reputation around town (Brock becomes a victim of the dark suit as well). One would think that with all this occupying the hero, the scenarists (Ivan Raimi, Alvin Sargent and writer/director Sam Raimi) wouldn't have much time left over for romantic entanglements, but one would be wrong in that assumption, for a great deal of the film is devoted to the relationship between Parker and his girlfriend, Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), who has become a tremendously needy, whiney and self-pitying character in this installment. In fact, so tedious is the romance this time around that whatever charisma and charm Maguire and Dunst exuded as a couple in the previous two films has been completely wiped out on this occasion. While I must concede that they are both tremendously likable actors, I think they may have gone once too often to the well with these particular roles. Maguire's impossibly sweet and good-natured demeanor has become particularly annoying at this point (although he isn't all that convincing when he's trying to play the bad-boy villain either).I've never been much of a fan of Spider-Man, either in comic book form or in the movies, but one of the reasons why ""Spider-Man 2"" worked as a film and the others haven't is because, in that movie, Parker's crippling self-doubts about whether or not he was really cut out to be a superhero gave a depth to the character that was psychologically sound and which made it easy for the audience to identify with him. In ""Spider-Man 3,"" however, Parker essentially has his ""evil"" thrust upon him from an outside source and, thus, that key psychological dimension is now lacking. Instead, the filmmakers have decided to really turn on the waterworks in this film, with just about everybody breaking down in tears at one point or another, culminating in an ending so syrupy and sappy that both dieters and diabetics should probably leave the theater a good fifteen minutes before the close of the story.That pretty much leaves the special effects, which run the gamut from decent (they still haven't really figured out how to make Spiderman's ""flying"" very convincing on screen) to spectacular (the Sandman is a really cool creature, indeed). The fight scenes are impressively hectic and noisy (which may explain the headache I developed halfway through the film), but it is rather difficult to develop much of a personal rooting interest in the outcome when a group of what are essentially invincible figures are battling it out for supremacy. And talk about villain overkill! With ""Spider-Man 3,"" the superhero's movie batting-average drops from an impressive .500 to a middling .333. Let's hope he can raise it back up the next time he steps up to the plate.","49 out of 98 found this helpful.

The theater was packed and everyone was so hyped to see it, I mean, could you ask for a better movie experience? Spider-Man 3 has massive special effects that I have to admit were very impressive, the actors were fun, and the story was pretty good, but I have to honestly say that after all that hype, I wasn't incredibly impressed. Unfortunately, Spider-Man 3 left me and my friends with no closure to what could have been an excellent trilogy. But still this was indeed an exciting summer blockbuster that I'm sure you won't wanna miss.Spider Man has been given a day in dedication from New York, he is admired and loved by all, and quite frankly, it's getting to his head. Peter however is still the geek in real life, not too respected by anyone, but he still has Mary Jane who he wants to ask to marry him. Mary Jane is struggling in her career and is questioning her relationship with Peter and Spider Man. Harry is also back and during a huge fight between him and Spider Man he is knocked unconscious and has short term memory, but slowly realizes that he is still thirsty for revenge on his father's death. But that's the little of Peter's problem when a black goo turns him into an evil alternate of Spider Man and when Peter finds out that the man who actually killed his uncle is at large, he lets the evil out and is only out for cold revenge.Spider Man 3 is a great blockbuster that is the big start to our summer of trilogies, I would highly recommend this movie for anyone, it was a lot of fun to watch. But I wouldn't expect the greatest movie, I still love the first one the best, but I'm sure you will get 2 hours of pure entertainment, the special effects were awesome and I hope there is eventually another Spider Man in the near future. Great jokes, corny lines, fantastic fights, and exciting plots, super hero movies, aren't they great?7/10","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

Then too, the scenes with ROSEMARY HARRIS, a warm and engaging actress, add to the almost soap opera flavor of the script in dealing with Spidey's human side.But fortunately, there are enough humorous moments to atone for some of the script's shortcomings in this regard. BRUCE CAMPBELL as a French Maitre d' has a wonderful bit at the restaurant where Spidey is preparing to meet and propose to Mary Jane with a ring. And even bigger bits of humor are provided by J. K. SIMMONS as J. Jonah Jameson, the harried boss of the Daily Bugle, notably in his wonderful office scene where a diligent secretary has a novel way of reminding him to take his blood pressure pills. He's a welcome scene-stealing presence in any scene.There's plenty of villainy going on in the guise of three chaps bent on destroying Spider-Man, the best of which is THOMAS HADEN CHURCH as the ex-convict who gets caught up in an experiment that turns him into the Sandman creature that terrorizes New York City. His transformation scenes are brilliantly done with the CGI effects outdoing themselves. He has that tough guy persona that looks just right for the role.But the best written part for one of the three villains belongs to JAMES FRANCO who is able to convey much more of what makes Goblin II tick. He switches from affable to intense hatred with the greatest of ease and gets a lot out of the character he's playing.Not as well scripted, but easily among the best performers in the film, is TOPHER GRACE, arrogant rival photographer at the Daily Bugle, who does a fine job as a Spider-Man adversary when he turns into Venom. Unfortunately, this comes pretty late in the film (almost as an afterthought by the writers) and he doesn't get enough time on screen to flesh out the character which would have been one of the most interesting villains if time permitted.As it is, it all runs well over two hours and stays on a pretty smooth course throughout, for such a long film. Except for the lulls whenever Spidey deals with his romantic complications, it's a pretty fast-moving story that has some eye-filling special effects whenever things get too dull in the storytelling department.TOBEY MAGUIRE certainly gets a chance to stretch. When his darker side takes over (and he's wearing that black suit), he shows a side of his screen personality that's been hidden in all the other Spider-Man films, and his arrogance with dance moves--while staying in character with his nerdy side--are played for laughs which are intentional.BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD makes a suitable cliff-hanging sort of heroine who can scream as well as Fay Wray (the Queen of Scream), and THERESA RUSSELL stands out in her one brief scene as Mrs. Marko.I thoroughly enjoyed it as a blockbuster movie designed to entertain and thrill as only these Spider-Man movies can. The CGI is remarkable for the Sandman sequences, all the production values are first class and Christopher Young's background score is a decided asset. But, personally, I still think I preferred the other two Spider-Man films over this one.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, it follows two pretty good Spider-Man films, so that's kind of a disappointment. If you've seen the previews, you can probably guess what goes wrong: too many villains, and too many characters in general. If you thought Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was sloppily written with all its stories going on (and I didn't myself), this one's going to look like Hell. They have to cut between Peter and MJ, Harry Osbourne, Flint Marko (aka Sandman), and Eddie Brock (aka, at least late in the movie, Venom). A million things happen, and the screenwriters (only three listed, but my guess is there were dozens) have a difficult time keeping it together. They seem to forget characters' motivations at times, and they forget to explain some things, or explain them so quickly that, when they're referenced later in the movie, you have to backtrack and figure it all out. My favorite is the whole relationship between Eddie Brock, Peter Parker's photographer rival, and Gwen Stacy, a classmate of Parker's who becomes Mary Jane's romantic rival. Gwen serves as about ten different plot points at once; it becomes pretty amusing. And she's played by Bryce Dallas Howard, most famous for her extremely bizarre turns in M. Night Shyamalan's last two movies (and to a lesser extent her excellent performance in Lars von Trier's Manderlay). It's just weird to see her as the blonde bombshell type. Gwen and Eddie's relationship is briefly mentioned twice early in the film, with the two barely making contact in the two scenes they share. Later, once Brock is Venom, he is apparently angry at Spider-Man for stealing his girlfriend. This whole thing just made me giggle. Oh, and don't even ask about Harry Osbourne's butler, who magically appears at one point and delivers the stupidest deus ex machina in recent movie memory. Okay, so the movie's badly made. Doesn't mean it isn't entertaining, though. The action sequences are fun, even though a couple of them are so fast you can't tell what's going on. There are a couple of comic sequences which are amusing, even if they feel weird in the context of the film. Particularly funny is the scene where Peter Parker struts down the street wearing the evil black Spider-Man costume under his clothes (it amplifies his aggression, or some such swiftly explained nonsense). And, hey, although it's bad, it's never boring, and I'd even say it's close to entertainingly bad. I mean, I can't hate a film too much that has a climax where Tobey Maguire fights the mechanic from Wings and Eric Foreman.","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

My brother works in the comic book industry and I simply could not wait to see this with him and the rest of my family. (Insert enormous sigh here). I've read many of the negative comments and feedback, and I can unreservedly say that I agree with them ALL. My family and I were HUGELY DISAPPOINTED with this movie, and that simply SUCKS since we were expecting SO MUCH more. Our theatre was packed, and when the movie *finally* ended, the reaction was definitely mixed, with most of the feeling being in the ""What the?!"" category. Many people sat shaking their heads in utter disbelief and shock. I just cannot believe that Sam Raimi is now on the same shameless loser level as George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers. I won't go on with any more tedious remarks about WHY the film sucked, since many of you have already eloquently expressed the same views. But I will say, that I left the theatre feeling pretty much the same way I did after seeing ""The Phantom Menace"" and ""Matrix: Revolutions"". This will go down as the most hyped and most surprisingly disappointing movie, EVER. I won't even buy the DVD. When I asked my brother afterward what he thought of the movie, he simply responded: ""What movie?"" It's our inside joke for when a movie's SUCK FACTOR is off the charts. We simply deny it's existence. Spiderman 2, however, will always be my favorite superhero/comic book movie. It was sheer genius, and I guess, lightning in a bottle for the filmmakers, since they've now become creatively anemic. So as far as I'm concerned, there are only TWO Spiderman films. And maan, that hurts.","17 out of 30 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Not as fantastic as the previous two Spidey flicks","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1647522/?ref_=tt_urv","jemps918","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10756301/?ref_=tt_urv","1 May 2007","Attended the sunrise screening of Spidey 3 in Alabang and the place was buzzing with excitement. It was most fortunate to premiere the film open on a holiday (May 1) because it was pretty packed.The verdict: not as fantastic as the previous two Spidey flicks, but it's recommended viewing anyway just so you can form your own opinion on it.True Spiderman comic fans might be disappointed to see that a lot of what's in the main comicbook story lines and characterizations were not dutifully translated on screen. The movie also runs on too long, but nevertheless, the special effects are amazing.We also get to see a more human side of Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) developing a split personality: Plain vs. Mod Peter Parker/Spidey. In this installment, Spidey's fame inexplicably gets to his head, much to his girlfriend MJ (Kirsten Dunst)'s dismay. He comes across an alien symbiote that attaches itself to him and feeds his darker, more aggressive side.We get a few laughs when Peter embraces this more vengeful side of him, and his style suddenly gets more mod: dark eyeliner, dark skinny suits, sleek parted hair. He looks like he belongs in an alternative/punk/rock band, complete with the attitude.Meanwhile, the villains were pretty impressive: Goblin Jr. (James Franco) battles it out with Spidey to avenge his father's death. Thomas Haden Church (Sideways) plays the powerful, indestructible and ever elusive Sandman, while Topher Grace (That 70s Show, In Good Company) plays Parker's nemesis Eddie Brock/Venom. However, there are quite a number of plot holes (like, how come Peter can control the symbiote as a suit but on Eddie it attaches itself fully and gives him really bad teeth?).The movie entertained the kids in some parts, but the natives grew increasingly restless as the movie culminates to a flat close. It was as if director Sam Raimi just wanted to throw everything in there. Nonetheless, this movie is pretty sure to rake in the big bucks just with all the hype alone.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

She and I made a deal to do this after SM2. We'll both remember this ""date"" for a long time. Theater was packed, which added to the excitement, but for me, once the movie started the excitement quickly melted away.I expected a lot more from SM3 then it delivered. Lots more. And I see from reading other reviews, that I am not alone here. I won't repeat what others have already said, but I'll add that if the budget for this movie was what I've been hearing - 250-300 million - its hard to believe that its producers couldn't come up with a better product. No, a **much** better product.Sure some of the CGI was good, although too quick to keep up with in some cases, but without a good story and character development to back it up..... you know the rest.SM1 - 7, SM2 - 9, SM3 - 5 (and that might be a bit generous)Worth seeing? Yep, but don't expect what 1 and 2 delivered, unfortunately.Also wonder why the IMDb user ratings are what they are compared to the reviews. They definitely don't line up, by what looks like a large margin. Take a look and see for yourself.","28 out of 54 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Good, but still the weakest Spider-man film so far.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1648981/?ref_=tt_urv","TJ1380","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1299658/?ref_=tt_urv","4 May 2007","It becomes pretty obvious why this ""Spider-man"" film is the weakest of the three when one looks at the plot. After two movies of nothing but bad luck, things are finally going well for Peter Parker. He's loved by all of New York, he's acing his college classes, and he's ready to propose to Mary Jane. In fact, his life is going so well that he doesn't seem to realize that his relationship with Mary Jane is failing. Meanwhile, Harry has finally decided to try to kill Peter to avenge his father's death, but a head injury causes him to lose his memory and basically go back to being the best friend that he used to be to Peter. Meanwhile, an escaped convict named Flint Marko has a bizarre accident and becomes a being made entirely out of sand (naturally called The Sandman). It is also revealed that he was involved in the death of Peter's Uncle Ben, which drives Peter to seek revenge. Peter is also competing for a staff position at the Daily Bugle against a sleazy new photographer named Eddie Brock. While all this is happening, a strange alien substance that crashed to Earth on a meteor has bonded with Peter, which increases his powers and gives him a cool new black suit, but it also turns him into a cocky, angry, arrogant, violent jerk.Any one of the main story lines could've made a good movie by itself. The problem here is that we get all of this as well as a handful of minor subplots in one movie that still isn't long enough to handle them even at nearly two and a half hours. It doesn't handle any of this stuff particularly badly, but it's still way too much for one movie to handle. The film seems to introduce one subplot, focus on it for awhile, and move on to something else. Some genuinely interesting characters are introduced and quickly disappear until the film is ready to pick up whatever subplot they're involved in. That's not to say this is a bad movie. There's still a lot to like here despite the obvious flaws. The acting is still on par with what we saw in the first two movies. Tobey Maguire still plays Peter Parker like a geeky yet earnest young man that the audience can't help but like, yet he's giving something new to do here for the first time in this series. The main plot focuses on Peter's dark side as it is brought out by the black alien suit, and the film really has fun with that. There will probably be a lot of complaints about the fact that Peter's transformation is handled with more of a sense of humor than anything, but I for one enjoyed seeing Maguire act like a total jerk. That's really the best way to describe Peter's behavior. He gets angry with people over small things, he starts dating an attractive classmate to make Mary Jane jealous, he orders his coworkers at the Daily Bugle around like he owns the place, and generally behaves with a cockiness and arrogance that we haven't seen from the character before. Like I said, this is usually handled with more of a sense of humor than people might like (there's even a goofy moment where Peter struts down the street like he's John Travolta in ""Saturday Night Fever""), so I have a feeling the hardcore Spider-man fans who know about this subplot from the comics will be divided. The supporting cast is largely the same as in the first two movies, with J.K. Simmons once again stealing the show as Peter's quick-tempered fast talking boss J. Jonah Jameson. James Franco and Kirsten Dunst once again make up the main supporting cast as Harry and Mary Jane. Franco has probably the most interesting and tragic story arc here, with his character undergoing numerous changes that are all surprisingly believable. On the other hand, Dunst is practically wasted. The relationship between Peter and Mary Jane has always been at the heart of the ""Spider-man"" movies, but I just didn't care for Mary Jane at all here. She comes off as selfish, petty, and so unlikable that I really didn't care when she was inevitably placed back into the role of damsel in distress. As for the newcomers Thomas Haden Church and Topher Grace, they do a great job as long as they're on screen. Church plays The Sandman as a reluctant and genuinely remorseful villain who almost has a good reason for doing what he does, and Grace manages to make the audience hate Eddie Brock for being such an arrogant prick while still giving him a great story arc that turns him into a real threat to Spider-man. Both of these characters make great villains, and it's a real shame that the film can't go into greater detail with them.The action and special effects are about what I expected from this kind of movie. They never reach the heights that they did in moments like the great fight on the train in ""Spider-man 2,"" but they still manage to be exciting. The two best moments are clearly the birth of the Sandman (in which Flint Marko slowly pulls himself together after turning into a pile of sand) and the final battle royale where all the major characters fight it out at a construction site. Like I said, there's nothing that tops the train scene from ""Spider-man 2,"" but the film does come close.Despite it's obvious flaws, this really wasn't a bad movie. It still retains plenty of the charm of the first two ""Spider-man"" movies, but it just tries to do way too much for one film to handle. I would've rather seen Sam Raimi go the route taken by ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and film two much tighter movies instead of one rather sloppy one.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I felt like a movie that costs around 215 million dollars to make, would be a f*ing good movie. This was definitely not the case.

Go watch the Amazing Spider-Man series, and enjoy as the so-called ""Peter"" does a flip on his skateboard and write ""I love you"" with his webs on bridge (Ha-ha-ha!). Sam Raimi didn't want to include Venom in this movie, but was forced to. All the fans complain about is that he didn't get enough screen time. Touche to that, truly. BUT, even the little screen time given to him was enough for us to see what he did in a very little time, and we wanted him dead. Now, for the best parts, tell me, didn't you guys like the Sandman part? The bad-ass villain was everything I wanted in this movie, and more. AGAIN, WANT TO SEE A BAD EXAMPLE OF TOO MANY VILLAINS IN ONE MOVIE? WATCH THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN 2! This movie didn't leave anything half-assed at least. The movie has grossed much more than any of the later Spider-Man movies (or should I even call them that) earned, and the only thing I was disappointed in was that they couldn't get the original series to finish off properly. Long story short, despite what you guys might say, I really loved this movie, and you should really look into the fact that Tobey pulled off the emo part well too.","14 out of 20 found this helpful.

I am however a long standing Scottish cinema manager, have a love for films and have (like everyone else here) an opinion. When commenting here I draw from my film experience as well as my boy-hood love of the arachnid hero! I am fortunate to have had an advance screening of the 3rd installment and had been excited for weeks and months and yes, I probably did build my expectations up too much but this was only setting me up for a plumit to earth with no web to fire and save me! On a positive angle I could not have been more impressed by the action sequences. This is a fine example of what C.G.I is capable of and is really the saving grace of this film and is what is going to pull the punters through our cinema doors.Unfortunately I found these sequences lost in what was a fairly average and lost plot. There seemed no structure with this movie and I felt it was always just too long a wait until the next 'big scene'. Please tell me also why I should have to cringe at least 3 times in this film after watching scenes which seemed to be better placed in a 3rd rate rom-com. You should not be cringing at Spiderman...you should be on the edge of your seat! Didn't want to give spoilers away, just my opinions. Most will enjoy this movie but it is not a shade on the fantastic second Spidey. If you haven't seen it yet...enjoy. It is the start of a great summer of film hits!","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Not the best however. In this Spiderman film, it seemed like the villains were there just to give the movie an actual bad guy. It focused a lot on Peter Parker's inner feelings, along with Mary Jane's. The bad guys in this were The Sandman (Church) and Venom (Grace). It felt weird to me having Topher Grace as Venom, or even including Venom at all. The character of Venom doesn't appear until late in the film, which felt weird passing him off as a main villain at the last minute. Topher Grace, however, was great as the photographer that became Venom. He played a small, but great role. Thomas Haden Church played a quieter villain with not much to say, but he has a screen presence that came across quite well. James Cromwell was in this for some reason, I have no idea why. As for the movie itself, it was very entertaining. Sometimes it would become too much of a comedy for it's own good, or too dramatic, but it still was fun to watch, so I can't say I was disappointed. One more added bonus to the film was a hilarious cameo that worked well by Bruce Campbell as a maitre'd.My rating: *** out of ****. 136 mins.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Everything seems to be a messy mixture of cheap action and drama films. Firstly, every scene was badly made, they meant nothing together. It was impossible for me to find even a small reasonable connection between them. In other words, this movie meant about nothing but a bunch of ... What a poor script! Second, every character seems to be normalized horribly. No one of them even have a individual personality and they act like they're all out of mind. Yeah, this is really supportive and suitable for a amazing bad script.Every good movie must has something something to differentiate itself from others and to make audiences remember about.

The original cast returns where they left off, with Peter Parker in a happy relationship with Mary-Jane, and for his grand finale, he has to battle not one, not two, but three comic book villains! Audiences waited patiently during the first two movies for the most popular Spider-Man bad guy to show up: Eddie Brock and his alter-ego Venom finally join the big screen. In addition to Venom, Gwen Stacey, Sandman, and the New Goblin make appearances as well.Thomas Haden Church guest stars and will tug on your heart strings even though he's one of the bad guys. My brother had never seen him in a movie before, and he thought the studio had made an entirely digital character. He really does look like he was peeled off the comic book pages and digitally enhanced to look like a 3-D human actor. It's a fine line to walk when you're trying to personify a comic villain with a sad backstory, and Thomas nails it. You'll be reaching for your Kleenexes and marveling at how Sony Pictures created a digital actor with such lifelike expressions. Just kidding. But if you're expecting the most impressive digital effects of all three movies, you won't be disappointed. Thomas's character literally disintegrates into grains of sand in nearly every scene! How do they do that? How do they get the slimy symbiote to crawl in and infect Topher Grace? The special effects in Spider-Man 3 are truly incredible.This one is the best of the three, and since everyone knows origin stories are usually the best, this one's got to be fantastic to wear the crown. Every plot point moves quickly, and you'll feel as harried and exhausted as Peter Parker by the time it's all over. Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, is given a slightly different backstory than the comic books, but it makes so much sense, it won't bother even the biggest fans. He's a rival photographer at the same newspaper, headed by the hilarious J.K. Simmons, and when he loses his job, his girl, and his respect, he vows to get even. The evil in his heart is quickly joined by Venom, and the rest is history.Those of you who miss Willem Dafoe and believe all other villains to be inferior will be happy that he still makes appearances in later movies through mirrors and memories. Before his son, James Franco, can avenge him, he gets a pretty bad bump on the head and forgets everything. Kirsten Dunst wants to help her old friend, and as she's nursing him back to health, they grow closer. This is the movie and the moment you've been waiting for, folks: the omelet scene. How cute are they? It's such a cute scene, and in a full, entertaining movie with action scenes galore, songs and dances, and everyone's favorite villain dominating the screen, the omelet scene might be my favorite. The ""I'm the other guy"" diner scene is close second.With all the drama included in this movie, there has to be quite a bit of comic relief to counteract it and make audiences feel better. Thankfully, there are tons of jokes to keep you laughing. Kirsten Dunst tries her hand at a Broadway musical, but bad reviews write up that her voice can't be heard past the first row. Tobey defends her, insisting he heard her perfectly. ""You were in the first row!"" she sighs. There's a proposal looming over their heads, as Tobey borrows his aunt's ring and tries to plan a perfect evening, but it ends in comic disaster. So rest assured, even though this one has some very sad moments-what's a conclusion without some tears?-you'll have plenty of laughs to cushion the blow.Everyone gets his day in the sun in this movie, so no matter who your favorite character is, he or she will get a gem or two as they close out the franchise. If you love Tobey Maguire, he gets to break out of his shell and find out how much fun it is to be the bad guy for a change. If you love Kirsten Dunst, your heart will break for her as she tries to sort out her relationship troubles with her very complicated boyfriend. Rosemary Harris fans will appreciate her wise wisdom, and J.K. Simmons fans will appreciate his secretary Elizabeth Banks's efforts to calm him down. If you like James Franco, you'll fall in love with him all over again in this one; if your tastes run more rugged, you'll root for Thomas Haden Church to get a second chance. You'll even feel sorry for Topher Grace as he's utterly humiliated, and you won't hold any grudges against sweet Bryce Dallas Howard, who innocently causes trouble.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spiderman flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""","15 out of 22 found this helpful.

After waiting in line for 50 minutes then sitting for 2.20 minutes on a seat i came out of the the place and was frustrated. My dad asked how the movie was and i smiled and lied ""the best of the year"" What i was really thinking was this is the worst movie and how come my birthday comes once a year and i choose this movie.Now its 10 days after it came out. This movie was a waste of my time and i made a list of bad and good things. Here we go! The Good: Great Effects. (The Giant Sandman at end of movie) Great Action. (Venom and Spidey fighting) Great Story ( The Whole movie) Great Villains ( Venom) Great Comedy ( J. Jonah Jameson) The Bad: Costumes ( They don't look really cool such as Spider-man. its just a suit but nothing else special, seeing Brock's face in a costume is stupid, Harrys costume is not so cool ) Mary Jane ( Mary Jane obviously ruins the whole movie. Why is everything about Mary Jane. 3/4 Of the movie is about her. For God Sake ever since Spider-man 1 started he starts talking about Mary-Jane) Time Limit for Venom ( When Venom appeared the movie was almost over and he was only in it for 15 minutes.Then he explodes with the suit. How Ridicoulous) Ideas: ( Whos stupid idea was to have venom and Harry The Bridge Scene ( God how embarrassing for Tobey Maguire to have him and his fake crying act) WE WILL NEVER FORGET.Explanation ( Since when does some strange liquid come from a meteor) Emo ( Stupid Idea of Peter going emu) As you can see there are positive and negative for this movie. This movie is worth a rental. If you are curious enough to see it do yourself a favor and wait till the DVD comes out and rent it. I only think this movie is worth watching in theaters if you like a good romance story with a little bit of action.

But years later, I found out critics and audience ranting about it because of its overload of villains. How much you spread negativity and hatred towards it I am not able to hate it. Because I still enjoy 3rd part like the first two. Its true that film has some drawbacks. Obviously the film suffers because of multiple villains(because raimi was forced to include venom). There are many loopholes in the script eg: why that butler was silent for so many years when he knew the truth about norman's death way before. And the climax gives us a sense of déjà vu where like the previous two films mj is kidnapped by the villain in order to reach spidey.Despite pressure from studios Sam raimi managed to keep it as entertaining as the two. Its so sad this franchise ends in a bad way. Wish we could have seen spiderman 4.I love Sam raimi trilogy.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I thought 1 was good and 2 was excellent. Yes, a lot of the dialogue is cheesy, but it's a comic book series. It's based on action and stories.Now that we got this out of the way, let me say that if this wasn't a part of the Spider-Man series then this would be on every critics bottom 10 list for the year.I was so excited to see it, but they really took the cheesy dialogue, really lame scenes and horrible attempts to elicit emotional responses to an all time high.By now, we all know the story. Peter Parker is a photographer with an alter-ego...he is Spider-Man. He's in love with the emotionally hard to figure out Mary Jane Watson.Very early in the movie we get one of the 'anticipated' matchups when Harry and Peter fight. Not Spider-Man, but Peter. Harry is all done out in his father's goblin suit.Of course this first battle ends out in a victory for Spidey. Harry takes a huge hit to the head on a bar and is knocked out and is dying. Peter gets him to a hospital where the doctors are able to save him, but he now has what could be permanent short-term memory loss. He can't remember his anger for Peter, he can't remember if he has a girlfriend or not...he pretty much only remembers up until high school.The other 'Bad guys' are played by Thomas Haden Church, who is a character called ""The Sandman"" who can do amazing things after being involved in a freak accident while on the run from the police after breaking out of prison, and the other is Topher Grace who plays Venom. We'll get to him later.Peter finds out that his grandfather's murderer was not found originally and that the convict escaped from prison is the one who did it.With his anger growing, a black, sticky, ooze creeps on to Peter and takes over. He is now Venom. He has nothing but anger and revenge in his heart.After a series of unfortunate events, he feels the need to get rid of the suit. He fights himself to get it off and finally does so only to have the black ooze transfer on to Peter's arch enemy from The Bugle, Edward Brock.I can't say much more without giving away the plot, but good gosh this was bad. There are many scenes that make you cringe because of how bad the dialogue is and there are plenty of scenes that tested my gag reflex (Harry and MJ doing the twist, Peter walking down the street with a new attitude and pointing and winking at girls as he goes along, Peter doing pelvic thrusts in a men's store, Peter dancing and playing piano in a jazz bar, etc.) Peter's Venom side is actually quite intriguing though. When he is Peter, he has an attitude. He will willingly fight people on the street without his suit. Not bad guys, he'll fight people who just plain tick him off. His edge is nice, but not really useful except for in a couple of scenes.Overall, this is probably the worst comic book movie ever. Not kidding.I'd avoid at all cost, but knowing that it's Spider-Man, I know most can't resist. They're curious and they have to know.Well, don't say I didn't warn you...","31 out of 61 found this helpful.

Putting aside all the cheezy graphics that this film brings and what could be the worst performance of Tobey Maguire's career one major thing is missing from this movie...a good director. Sam Raimi has massacred the whole venom plot line of Spiderman. Venom in the comic book makes Peter Parker evil, but in the film he just seems, for lack of a better word, goofy. The whole sequence where Spiderman is taken over by venom, where he apparently turns emo, is absurd. He turns pure evil, even going so far as to dance with another woman in from of Mary Jane. How sycophantic can you get? Terrible, Terrible addition to a great series.","17 out of 31 found this helpful.

The original, while fresh and exciting was not without it's flaws. With all of it's back story and build-up we were left with only the beginning, the first chapter in adventures yet to come and thus not as inviting to multiple viewings. A strong, charming film and a worthy realization of Spidey on the big screen, but it still, like Peter Parker himself, certainly had room to grow and mature. Enter Spider-Man 2. Hilarious, exciting, heartbreaking and sometimes all at once (look no further than the tour-de-force finale) it is not only a stellar ""superhero"" flick but a well crafted, emotionally powerful and sincere film of any genre. It had raised the bar for blockbusters across the board. Now comes Spider-Man 3. With word of a mammoth budget and incredibly high fan expectation, meeting status quo will and has been interpreted by many as failure. Public perception seems to be as of this writing, that the film is not up to snuff of the previous 2, however in truth it is as good in different ways than it's predecessors, just not better. This is a no win scenario as it no longer has the benefit of first time novelty and must raise the stakes across the board to not only deal with it's own track record, but several franchises that have become more mature and complex in their own right (Batman Begins, Superman Returns and even non-superhero pulled from comic epics like 300 and Sin City). So the film piles on even more battles, more set pieces with outcomes determining bigger stakes and even bigger sacrifices. As a whole it is quite a wonder to see how it all gels in the end and makes sense because there is a lot going on here. Unfortunately, fans and critics (especially critics) are often cynical with ongoing installments of any series, and here the most vocal and easily annoyed are given some legitimate ammunition. 1) There is far too much emphasis in getting characters out of their masks and reminding us of the actor's abilities and not realizing the characters themselves. Voices are rarely altered (this vocal oversight is most noticeably a problem with Venom) and characters rarely wear the full costumes and masks they have been celebrated and associated with on page for decades. It seems quite obvious the studio paid for names, and thusly want bang for the buck. So we not only get a number of big ""thespian"" moments of tears, songs and dance (literally) to satisfy actor needs to ""showcase"" but we also get Spidey to often without a mask, Goblin 2 who rarely uses the protective mask that you would assume he needs to be safe during his acrobatic daring do and a constant facial reminder of who exactly is playing Venom (and at times in poorly chosen moments which detract from menace). The viewer is often ""taken"" out of the film. 2)Not enough forward progression. Some loose ends are tied, but the film leaves many still dangling and some rather large ones open altogether! While there is redemption, on the whole there is a feeling that this is an ""installment"" rather than true closure. That being said, anyone who tells you the money isn't on the screen must have been watching a different film. From the quiet almost poetic creation of the Sandman as he forms human shape; to the many brawls throughout the film, leading up to the juggernaut finale, you get your CGI money's worth, even if you do loose a little of the humanity in all of the many computer pixels buzzing around. The human moments are still the franchise's strongest points and there's more drama here than a full night of 1980's prime time soap opera. The whole endeavor may be a victim of it's own excess, but only the truly jaded and cynical viewer wont appreciate the tapestry of spectacle and emotion woven by director Sam Raimi and Comapny for what is still a Summer blockbuster entertainment that aims to be more than a clichéd collection of one liners and eye candy. It has a lot to live up and to, and sometimes fails but it remains a worthy successor in truly unique escapist franchise. 'Nuff said.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The acting is poor. The writing is predictable and cheesy. The action, which the Spider-Man series has been so good at portraying, was jumpy and short-lived. I couldn't believe that the plot had to go in so many directions. It was a bit hard to follow at times and did not lend itself to character development. Although the same writers and directors were employed for this installment, it seemed like they were grasping at air. Take everything that you liked from the previous movies and make it completely over-done. They should have stuck to a single villain because there is not a lot of development of the Sandman character. It also suffers from the success and critical acclaim of the first two movies in that the movie tries to include every good thing but fails miserably in the amalgamation. The previews make it look great and totally appealing but you can really show an extremely lacking plot in a 30 second TV spot. Yes it will make a boatload of money but that can't overrule how utterly disappointing this first summer blockbuster is.","33 out of 67 found this helpful.

So, in that context, I would just like to say that Spiderman 3 was a total dog's breakfast, and advise you to see something else.Its a rare cinema experience to see so many keen and eager people at the beginning of a film, with their chatting, fidgeting, laughing and excited expectations; and then to have these same people at the end of a film realising that, despite their best intentions, they have been completely let down, and so they simply quietly disperse.It fails because one senses the producers are more concerned about the survival of the franchise and the drive-thru burger license than the credibility of the story. You realise early on its all going to be so safely, completely and nicely resolved that any plot development is really only a distraction, and you start to wish the audience could have a show of hands to fast-forward thru the dull convoluted middle bits for the obvious showdown at the end.Its such a bland soulless CGI affair that you serious start thinking that even a cameo appearance by Jar Jar Binks would improve it (""Me's a tinking me Jar Jar senses are tinkling""). At least Jar Jar would be able to hand over the award for most stupid CGI creation, with ""The Monster from the Bag of Liquorice"" now being clearly the most ludicrous creation of all time.Forgetting all the logical inconsistencies and incredibly remote coincidences in the story (and thankfully, 15 minutes after you leave the cinema, you find that you do), the biggest sadness with this film is that the three characters, who you invested some emotional commitment to in the first two films, fail to develop or grow in any meaningful way. They just have a series of set pieces seemingly designed by a committee that is only missing someone in the background holding up a sign saying ""They are Now Sad"", ""They are Now Happy"", ""They are Now Angry"", or ""They are Now Trying to Be Funny"". It you do intend to watch this film, watch the first two first; because after seeing Spiderman 3, you will find the first two forever tainted, as you know now where its all going to head. Oh; and the praise. The Morwell Cinema in Victoria has assigned seating. Fantastic idea guys, I wish everyone would do this.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

There are a few more sub-plots  an alien black organism transforming Spider Man and later his competitive reporter to evil ones, and lastly the Sand Man. So in this movie as you must have noticed there are three enemies that Spider Man has to fight  Sand Man, Osborn Junior and the alien. With love story, action, drama and emotions - in the end Spider Man triumphs and I liked the movie just for its total entertainment value.The Director Sam Raimi has himself taken a shot at co-writing the screenplay with his elder brother Ivan Raimi. I think Sam has handled the complicated story line in a very sophisticated way on screen. He has given ample time and scope for each character to develop. The under-lying emotion in the script is obviously the love-story of Spider Man. The friendly neighborhood Spider Man is vulnerable, funny, humane, emotional and lovable when he is Peter Parker. There are good sequences of actions spread across the whole movie from time to time. With the number of enemies growing  we become eager to watch the ending on how Spider Man will fight all of them. This Spider Man also dances and grooves like John Travolta on the street showing his mean side.Toby Maguire excels in his role and it would be difficult to image any other face than him as Spider Man. Kristen Dust, James Franco, Thomas Hayden (as Sand Man) have played their part with director's cut.If you ask me what is not there in the movie  I have to think a hundred times to answer that question. Everything is there. The movie has all the entertainment cliché  but I never expected more than that from a Spider Man movie.I was happy to see for the first time - young, old, boys, girls, man and woman people  a whole range of mixed crowd enjoying the movie. Being a spectator I too enjoyed it. Take a huge bag of pop-corn, bottle of cola and chill out with die hard Spider Man fans  I think you will enjoy it more than me.(Stars 7 out of 10)","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Darker than its predecessors, it asks the question that has plagued us for three years now: How will ""Spider-Man 3"" condense so many Marvel Comics' story lines and sub-plots into a 140-minute feature-length running time?I had my own reservations about such notions when it was first announced that Spider-Man would be facing not one, not two, but THREE super-villains, each with long, drawn-out back-stories (and many comic book issues) of their own. As a lifelong fan of Spidey, the creation of Stan Lee and Steve Ditko for Marvel Comics, I was glad to hear that my favorite character (aside from Spider-Man himself) would be making a big-screen appearance now. After viewing the movie, another character becomes a favorite (more on this later).The ""Spider-Man"" title is well-known in the comics industry for being one of the best examples of a superhero whose problems outside of saving the world were given times and places in print to be properly fleshed out. Peter Parker (played superbly in the movies by Tobey Maguire, who's unsure if he'll return for part IV, if one ever manifests itself) was a geek, a loner, in grade and financial trouble, and had romantic woes; a bite from a genetically altered spider only compounded his problems. So this is why so many average Joes, like me, could relate to Spider-Man so easily. Although DC Comics had Batman and Superman, who both had great story lines, adventures and romantic entanglements of their own, it was Spidey's persistent personal problems that won over readers. The first two movies have addressed these perfectly.In ""Spider-Man 3,"" things seem to be looking up for our hero, both as Peter Parker and as Spider-Man, though they won't be that way for long. It seems he's finally gotten his life together and everything is going his way: Spider-Man has saved New York City from certain danger so many times he's finally getting the respect he so richly deserves (including the Key to the City). At school, he's at the top of his class, and he's about to pop the question to girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).However, he is still haunted by his inability to patch up his friendship with best pal Harry Osborn (James Franco), who blames Spider-Man and Peter for his father Norman Osborn's/Green Goblin's (played in the first film by Willem Dafoe, who also shows up here posthumously) death, although much is still unknown to the son, who eventually transforms himself into the notorious Green Goblin II, the first villain. And even though Mary Jane is a great Broadway actress and Peter tries to reassure her of that fact, she earns terrible reviews for her performance and is painfully distressed by the news. But because Peter is letting his newfound fame go to his head, it's difficult for her to express her real feelings to him.The meat of the story gets underway when a mysterious black ooze bonds with Peter, and the alien symbiote brings about a darker side of his personality that threatens to destroy him. Once in the new ""black suit,"" he comes to add revenge to his list of to-do items when he discovers that escaped convict Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) was involved in the death of his beloved Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson, in flashback). Marko, on the other hand, while fleeing the cops, falls into an experimental vat and has his molecules zapped away, later reconstituting himself with the sand to become the Sandman. The Sandman becomes villain #2.Meanwhile, a rival photographer at the Daily Bugle, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), wants Peter's job of peddling photographs of Spider-Man to editor J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons). Brock is also dating Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), who may or may not be flirting with Peter. Needless to say, when the two share a kiss and Mary Jane sees it, she doesn't take it lightly. The Black Suit continues an assault on Peter, who becomes increasingly hostile and once realizing what it's done to him, separates from it, the symbiote later bonding with a vengeful Eddie Brock to become Venom, villain #3. Can Peter Parker/Spider-Man overcome Green Goblin II, The Sandman and Venom (favorite), his inner demons, and get back Mary Jane and save the world within the allotted 140 minutes?Co-screenwriter Raimi returns to his love-labor project triumphant. While some things could have been better fleshed out, the 140-minute running time was really pushing it in terms of story. Still, he and brother Ivan's screenplay manages to play itself out reasonably, although I still believe much was left on the cutting room floor. It's also obvious Raimi's taken cues from the ""Superman"" movies on how to craft an epic story. It is true that ""Spider-Man 3"" seems to do a lot, but you have to give Raimi credit for doing what he was able to do, combing the pages of Marvel Comics and combining basically 40 years worth of storyline into 2 1/2 hours.While I doubt Tobey Maguire will probably return for another sequel, this is undoubtedly the actor's finest performance. It's amazing how well he was able to balance the tangled emotions of his tormented character. Although he has to be the least expressive good actor out there, I really liked him here, especially in his ""darker"" scenes. The other actors were good, including the great Rosemary Harris as Aunt May and especially Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko/The Sandman, who, like Dr. Otto Octavius/Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina) from ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004), earns our hearts as a sympathetic villain.For this fan, ""Spider-Man 3"" is a bit of a mixed triumph, but it's a valiant effort from actors and filmmakers that know the heart of their material well.10/10","26 out of 44 found this helpful.

The action scenes like most of them in this series are super fun and entertaining, the final battle with all the villains is really cool and exciting. I really like Harry's story arc and how it finally concludes in this film, I really like sandman and his compelling story and the way his story ties back to Peter is a cool way to give his character motivation. The main problem with this film is the symbiote because it's just super unnecessary, venom is a throwaway villain in this film and the black suit is just an awful side plot that ends up with the iconic cringe fest that is the dancing scene, Mary-Jane is a manipulative cow and I cannot stand her character in this movie, Peter is dumb as hell and makes some of the worst life choices I've ever seen. Yes this movie has a lot of dumb stuff in it but as a massive Spider-Man fan I just can't help but love this movie, and to be fair if you watch all these movies back to back they just feel the same.

Sandman, Green Goblin, Venom and Spiderman's dark sidehow many things? In my opinion, they should have toned it down and put some stuff in spiderman-4. My sister ( was disappointed that Venom (arch nemesis) was killed so easily. BUTAlthough all of these conflicts seemed overwhelming at times, I felt that this movie was taken in the best way with all of those conflicts. Anyways, Richard Corliss (Time Magazine) accurately commented on how the male characters in this movie were more ahem* sensitive than usual. I daresay that Spiderman cried much more than all the women put together in the movie and at the end his sobbing became so intense that my cousins started laughing. Maybe I am weird, but Peter Parker seemed so emotional and boyish to me that I was happy when he turned into the tough and insensitive guy for a change. Sandman also shed many tears, sinking this movie to an unusual depth. Although I found this male crying thing different, I'm not sure whether it aroused tears or snickers. I guess it's different for everybody and you'll have to decide for yourself","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Peter and MJ start to have relationship troubles, he begins to consider what Spider-Man means to him and how it's changed his life, all while a new villain is created and hatches a plot to get spidey.But where it was done so wonderfully in Spider-Man 2, it suffers in this film. This is due mainly to two things. Firstly, we've already seen it before so it doesn't feel fresh as it did in #2. Secondly, Spider-Man 2 had only one villain so the story focused completely on Doc Ock and as a result he became a very multidimensional and compelling character. In this installment, the villain duties are shared between Venom and Sandman, and neither character is developed anywhere near the level Doc Ock was. Venom in particular is presented almost as an afterthought, though Topher Grace does do a good job as Eddie Brock.There's a sequence in the film where Peter, possessed by the symbiote (the thing that gives him his black suit) starts doing some crazy things behaviour-wise. Although it's meant to be serious, they seem to go way over the top with it and it comes off seeming like little more than comedy relief. This particular sequence doesn't really seem to fit in the film very well.The Harry Osborn story gets mixed up here too as he takes not one, not two, but THREE character turns in the course of the movie and the subplot involving him seems underdeveloped and rushed.On the plus side, the special and visual effects are spectacular, save for one particularly cheesy scene where Spidey just happens to jump right in front of an American flag. The main actors do a passable job, Kirsten Dunst likely gives the strongest performance as MJ, also Rosemary Harris delivers another sweet yet strong performance as Aunt Mae.The other bright spots acting wise were J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and the incomparable Bruce Campbell as an extremely funny french maitre'd in one particularly memorable scene.In conclusion, the film is a bit of a letdown, but the disappointment is compounded by the fact that all the pieces were here for a great story, but it just didn't pull together like it could've. Definitely worth the price of admission though, even an average Spiderman movie is a pretty darned good superhero flick.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

If I had to talk about all the things wrong with this movie in-depth, I could probably go on for hours. Hours that would be better spent than the hours I wasted sitting at this cornball cry-fest. First thing's first: Where exactly has Spiderman's ""Spider-sense"" gone?How does someone who can sense even the least amount of danger to himself (ie. getting hit by a car, etc.) not sense or see the spiraling meteor of fiery, gooey-black death falling 10 feet away from him? Oh yeah...he's too wrapped up in making googly weepy-eyes at Mary-Jane. That's another thing. This is in NO way a superhero movie. If you go into this expecting to be as blown away as you were during Spiderman I and II, allow me to pop that bubble. At most, amidst the random singing, dancing, weeping, angsting, and general ""WAH"" from Peter Parker, this comes off as a musical romance. A dramatic, musical romance. And here I thought I was sitting down to watch...oh, I don't know...Spiderman? All the awesome CG and special effects and acting of the last two movies seemed to have vanished into the night, as it seems the makers behind this little suck-fest hit bottom of the barrel and vomited out the worst possible script in superhero history. This was even more painful to sit through than The Hulk. The villains are non-existent. Want to know why? Because there are NO villains in this movie. Only...*sniffle*...misunderstood victims :'( Aw...waaaaaah. Sandman and Hobgoblin both are but beaten-down shadows of themselves, and the only semi-saving grace in that particular department has to be Brock in his Carnage-suit, and even that was a far stretch.As for Mary-Jane and Peter...never have I hated both characters more. Peter Parker is reduced to a whiny, emo-spouting gothchilde (seriously, he wears eye-liner at one point...EYELINER!) and Mary-Jane is sufficiently slutified, becoming a jealous, entitlement-obsessed ninth-grader, just enough to send Parker over the edge.All in all, avoid at all costs unless you want this particular franchise ruined for you.","14 out of 25 found this helpful.

The bad Peter Parker is laughable, as is the slow mo landing besides a giant waving American flag. You can invariably predict what's going to happen next. A breeze block lands in Mary Janes taxi whilst she's suspended 80 feet above the street in a web. Is she going to bash a baddie's head with it?

No Seriously.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9308601/?ref_=tt_urv","ryanpersaud-59415","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur65683941/?ref_=tt_urv","6 September 2023","I remember back in May 2007 walking out of the theatre after watching Spider-Man 3, one of the most highly anticipated movies of the year, and thinking to myself, ""that was pretty good."" I was about 16 at the time, and like any 16 year old, parting with $10 just to admit the thing I paid for *wasn't good* was impossible. Yet, I remember going to my friend's house after and his sister asking me, ""how was it?"" And my answer?""Pretty gooooood."" I stressed the good because I knew, deep down, Spider-Man 3 wasn't good. It was a pretty bad movie, actually. Yet, years (and memes) later, a whopping 8 Spider-Man movies later, three Spider-Men (yes, I'm including Miles, fight me), and I think we can safely say, Spider-Man 3 wasn't *as bad* as most of us originally thought. Perhaps because we have so many filmic depictions of the character to choose from nowadays, this film doesn't come off as nearly as bad. I also think it's because we've seen far worse films (i.e. The Amazing Spider-Man series).The Good:1. It's funny. Like REALLY funny. Spider-Man 3 is a perfect example of ""so bad it's good."" There are so many unintentional (and perhaps, secretly intentional) moments that will have anyone cracking up like crazy. James Franco plays the funniest and dopiest version of Harry Osborn you could imagine. Topher Grace's Eddie Brock literally PRAYS in a church for God to ""kill Peter Parker"" with complete sincerity. There are so many weird and awkward side characters spouting hilarious one-liners, you can't help by have tears in your eyes by the end of this. Who can forget Emo Peter and his goofy sequence? Who could forget the jazz club scene? The pie scene with Harry?I suspect that Raimi, clearly not being a fan of including Venom in this film, just botched it on purpose. He made Venom a joke and Peter's turn to the dark side hilariously bad. I see it as a big middle finger to Sony, which I can completely get behind.2. The final action sequence + ending. As goofy and stupid as this movie is, I think the ending is genuinely awesome. It's emotional, it's touching, and it's satisfying. I really don't know what else to say. That it's accompanied by one of the best action sequences a Spider-Man film has shown us makes it even better. Sandman, despite being a no show for most of the movie, is a really terrifying villain and actually seems like someone Spider-Man COULDN'T easily defeat. The tandem of Spidey and Harry's Goblin was fun and creative. And while Venom was botched completely here, I can't deny some cool visuals came out of it.3. Raimi's style. At the end of the day, I'd still rather re-watch this movie than most of the live action films that came after it. A big part of this is the heart, personality, and style Raimi brings to the table. Yes this movie can be cringey and awkward at times. But it's par for the course with these movies. He's also easily the best director to take on this character, and it shows.The Bad:","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It has all the parts needed for a great action flick, but with no continuity. All the separate scenes felt disjointed and slopped together. The characters go through changes almost at random, every 5 minutes. Peter Parker's comic change in the middle of the movie was over the top, but it worked for me. It was meant to be comical and it was. The rest of his emotions were almost ridiculous. Every time he cried the opening-night audience around me laughed hysterically.I won't ruin the ending. I don't need to. Just think, ""cliche"" and you already know the ending. The movie was drowning in sappy emotion towards the end. I can just imagine the writers of this script sitting around saying to each other, ""Everyone does movies with non-stop action til the end. Let's deliver a real message."" I choked on that message as it was crammed down my throat.And in the end, they finished off with even more sappy emotion which left me totally unsatisfied. No uplifting joy at the end of this movie.

Plus, the action - while fun - feels less impactful than it should, mainly thanks to the overuse of digital body doubles; most of it is too big and too silly to ever feel like our heroes are ever really in danger (even though they are). However, despite its problems, this is still an enjoyable picture. It has several entertaining sequences and plenty of strong character development (the stuff surrounding 'The Sandman' is nearly perfect, for example). It also has a solid underlying theme and feels like a satisfying conclusion to its trilogy. Sometimes, it's great; sometimes, it's frustrating. Basically, it has all the right elements, but it doesn't quite come together as well as it should. In general, it works really well until it nears its final movement, which is where its narrative starts to feel over-cluttered and generally messy. It's clear that there are too many cooks in the kitchen behind the scenes. Still, everything comes together for a thematically rich and surprisingly affecting ending. This ending is so good that it almost makes you forget about the picture's less successful elements. The overall affair definitely isn't as bad as many would have you believe. It's a good movie with a great movie trapped inside it, one that's annoyingly close to getting out. 7/10","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I had high expectations and felt like I was dropped off one of those NY skyscrapers like one of the characters in every Spider-man flick. Except unlike those casted, I want to hit the pavement.The casting of Sandman was great, as were his scenes. His scenes where he was 10 feet tall and under that is. Otherwise it was pretty lame.Topher did a decent job as Venom as well. I didn't think he could pull off Eddie Brock, especially being a big fan of That 70's Show -- but he did well.Tobey stunk. Dunst stunk. Tons of horrible attempts at bad, bad, BAD comedy scenes which really kill the film unless you're one of those cheesy audience members that laughs at everything. You know, people that true movie-goers can't stand.Nothing special about this movie that made it stick out or any better than the previous 2. It's the worst of the trilogy thus far. Crap dialog, a lot of real corny scenes, and too much Spider-man minus the mask yet again.","12 out of 21 found this helpful.

Now Spider-Man, being famous and all, had to face new dangerous enemies while reconciling with people close to him.For a movie with multiple villains, I was pretty disappointed in terms of storyline. There's too many central characters to make each of them compelling. Also because of this there's less time dedicated to Peter Parker as a character. I don't think the movie went deep into Peter's character as much as it should like in the second one.For the positives, the action was definitely better. The fight between Spider-Man and Venom and Harry Osborn were entertaining, although they could be disorienting at times. Of course, Toby was just rocking it as Peter Parker, who became more edgy and cool. That iconic dancing in the street scene was so funny. That's another good thing: there were more comedic moments that worked well.Overall, I still enjoyed it, although I wanted more. 7.5/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The main problem being that there is just too much going in in the script, that it all comes out as rushed, half baked, and often cheesy and contrived.All the main cast are back again. Tobey Maguire does get to deliver some good scenes, like his anger over the Sandman/Ben connection, and his conflict with Harry Osborn. But he also delivers some cringe worthy stuff, notably the dancing stuff.Kirsten Dunst is absolutely dire as MJ. She irritates, moans, criticizes, and cries her way through the movie. She is truly unlikable in this movie. She commits so many offenses in this movie. From her hypocritical behavior over the Spidey/Gwen publicity kiss, to giving into Harry's empty threat to break Peter's heart, to her constant whining about her fading career.James Franco is probably the best actor of the movie. Although his character falls short in some areas. For starters he is not a Goblin. He is a guy in a black jumpsuit on a hoverboard. His grand revenge plan is nothing more than a silly break up of Peter and MJ, which made no sense. He spends a lot of the movie as a nice guy with amnesia, too. That said, he does deliver some great stuff. Notably his gloating to Peter about breaking him and MJ up. And that mansion fight was superb. His death scene was also emotionally great.Then we have Sandman, played by Thomas Haden Church, an actor who is utterly wasted in this movie. Sandman seems like an out of place element. He is a poor thief, who just wants to steal some money to help his sick daughter. But he's got a backstory. Turns out he's the guy who actually shot Uncle Ben. The other guy from Spider-Man 1 was just an accomplice. A horrible and needless contrived connection of Sandman to Peter. Sandman's is a visually pleasing villain (his birth scene is incredible), except in the scenes where he grows to giant proportions, and comes across as a retarded version of the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man from Ghostbusters. Church is a fine actor, but he is just a cog in a CGI machine. He has so little dialogue. Topher Grace plays the third baddie in the movie's trio of villains. He is Eddie Brock, a cocky and sleazy photographer competing with Peter for a permanent staff job at the Daily Bugle, who eventually becomes the symbiotic villain, Venom. He is even less used than Church. The script leaves him very little room to even become an important element until the climax. Bryce Dallas Howard plays iconic Spidey girl, Gwen Stacy. She's sweet, charming, pretty....and pointless. She is an object of Eddie Brock's affections, but this is only mentioned in ONE brief scene between them. She is simply a plot device to make MJ needlessly jealous. A darn shame, because Howard was ten times more likable than Dunst's MJ.The supporting cast like Aunt May and Jonah Jameson unsurprisingly have less screen time, but are still solid in what they are given to work with. Especially Aunt May, when she lectures Peter over the evils of revenge.The whole symbiote storyline was also excess baggage. Just look at how the symbiote is introduced. It falls from the sky, and randomly decides to hitch a ride on Peter's scooter. Why? The movie was supposed to be the darkest of the trilogy as it dealt with the whole theme of revenge. But it actually has more cheesy jokes, campiness, and off color jokes than the other two movies.But a lot of this was down to Sony, as they saddled Sam Raimi with characters that he didn't want to use: The symbiote storyline, Eddie Brock, and Gwen Stacy. I give him points for doing the best he could in a difficult situation.The movie has it's faults, but the good out weighs the bad whether it be the conclusion to Peter and Harry's arcs or the fight scenes. Spiderman 3 is a worthwhile watch.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Such a movie defies review because there is nothing substantive to review. All the talent, all the time, all the money and all the other creative resources that were expended to make this movie are ultimately wasted, all for nothing. Spiderman and his enemies are comic-book characters and no amount of special effects can change that fact. The characters are insipidly shallow, but what else is to be expected from a comic book story brought to the screen? That does not mean that movie can't be a moneymaker because it is a commercial product, but even compared to Superman or Batman, the movie does not contain enough intellectual content to sustain any drama. But if this is the kind of escapist fare that sells, then more power to the market place.There is one exception to the above comments.

Between a complete lack of character development and plot that jump between too many stories the movie was just all over the place. It is unbelievable that with material already written that has lasted the test of time for almost fifty years that something so bad could be turned out. But between too many not so good lookin fight scenes that looked fake and were not well choreographed and awful performances from Maguire, Franco, Dunst, and especially Thomas Hayden Church, who proved to the world why after Wings he was out of a work so long, this movie was a complete disaster. I don't know what people thought this sounded good on paper, or thought it was going find during production, and still thought it was good during editing but they all have no clue what they are doing. This movie will be one of the highest grossing movies of the year but in the end it will be remembered for its failure to live up to its predecessors and its effective murder of the Spider-man franchise.","38 out of 82 found this helpful.

The first two films are good movies, this film is a good superhero movie, there are lines of dialogue so corny they wouldn't feel out of place in the 60s Batman show and that dancing, oh that dancing. I like the cast, I think Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco all do well and I liked the portrayal of Sandman by Thomas Church, the problem I think was Topher Grace, I don't necessarily think it was his performance that let down the film but after he gets the symbiote I feel the film goes down hill. As always Danny Elfman is delivering a great score and I like the direction by Sam Raimi. This isn't a great film but it's silly and light-hearted and definitely not a waste of time to watch. I'm looking forward to seeing Thomas Church in the new Spider-Man film and wouldn't be completely against seeing Topher Grace as well although preferably not too much of him.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Please do not write to me messages about your opinions keep them to your selves.While the main hero struggles deeper with relationship with new characters shouldn't be considered a flaw. The movie isn't trying to focus so hard with the new comers which I'm glad about. It means more involvement with main characters and theirs struggles with one another.Uncle Ben death twist doesn't bother me. Since there are different recarnations of spiderman which have different circumstances to one another. There was a similar twist where Black Cats Dad is the real killer in the Spectacular Spider-Man show which was made shortly after this film.But please this film may have flaws but doesn't every other super hero film do.I'm a generous critic and some flaws are difficult to avoid no matter how hard you try. I'm not treating this film with arrogance or discrimination but with respect.I criticise with my opinion and not use other people's. Because I'm my own human being and I am no hypocrite.The reason I love this is it's different to the first two. In this film Spider-Man allies with a anti-hero who was villian at the throughout the film. To help him tackle the likes of Sandman and Venom. So it's a fair match two against two.There are few negatives in this film. Which have been edited in the editors cut which I'm thankful for.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

"7","/10","An amazing end to the trilogy.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1651497/?ref_=tt_urv","theshadow908","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1899620/?ref_=tt_urv","7 May 2007","When Spider-Man 3 begins, everything is going great for Peter Parker. New York finally loves and supports Spider-Man, he's doing great in school, and his relationship with Mary Jane couldn't be better. In fact, he's going to pop the question. Unfortunately, things start happening that get in the way of Peter's plans. Harry Osborn returns as the New Goblin and tries to kill him, he finds out that a new villain called the Sandman is his uncle's actual killer, and a strange alien creature takes the form of a black costume and tries to possess him. The alien begins to make Peter more aggressive as his new found fame goes to his head, making him cocky. Finally, Peter realizes that something is wrong, and he gets rid of the strange substance. Unfortunately, the creature attaches itself to Eddie Brock, a man who has lost everything to Peter Parker, and a new villain is formed. Quite possibly the most evil and deadliest villain Spider-Man has ever faced. Though this movie isn't as good as the first two in the series, it's still amazing and a lot of fun.What I liked about the first two movies was that they had a formula to them that allowed for plenty of personal drama for the characters as well as plenty of action. In this movie, Sam Raimi tries to squeeze in tons of personal drama between Peter and Mary Jane as well as Peter and Harry, and Peter and Eddie Brock, and Sandman and his daughter, and the list goes on, while also having action scenes featuring New Goblin, Sandman, a malfunctioning crane, and eventually Venom. This made certain scenes seem rushed and pointless. I liked that they kept the movie both funny and serious, because the humour in this series has always been a high point for me. The twenty or so minutes where Peter becomes evil were so enjoyable and humorous to me that I just couldn't stop smiling. The plot isn't that bad because it covers all the points that needed to be covered, and by the end of the movie it ties everything up nicely, leaving no need for a 4th film though I'm sure that it will happen. The action scenes in this movie are fantastic. The crane sequence was done really well and featured some of the best special effects yet. Also, the ways Spider-Man maneuvered in that scene were amazing. Both of Peter's fights with Harry were incredibly awesome. They were the most violent and intense fights in the whole series, and I loved them. As with the first two films there were a few lines of dialogue that made me cringe. Sam Lee's cameo in this film was his worst cameo to date. Now, what I really didn't like about this film was the characters of Sandman and Venom. The movie needed New Goblin because it was a continuation, but either Sandman or Venom should have been cut out. My reason is that Sandman was pretty much pointless to the rest of the story, and if he was gone, Venom could have had more screen time and development. If Venom was taken out, his character wouldn't have been destroyed the way it was. Venom had so little screen time that it literally annoyed me. And half the time he was on screen, he retracted his mask so it was just Eddie Brock with a black suit on. I really didn't like what Raimi did with the character, though I am happy I saw him in live action at all. I also didn't like that Mary Jane was whining about Peter being Spider-Man through the whole movie, and that by the time the movie ended, Peter still hadn't proposed.The acting in this movie is just as good as the other two. Tobey Maguire did a good job playing both the good and the evil Peter Parker. Kirsten Dunst played Mary Jane well once again, though I didn't really like her character in this. James Franco did an amazing job as Harry in this movie, especially when he was insane. He gave his best performance in this movie. Thomas Haden Church was pretty good as Sandman, he looked the part, but he didn't really get to do a whole lot with his talent. Topher Grace was funny as Eddie Brock, and he was surprisingly good when he became Venom. He's no longer Eric Foreman to me.Overall, the first two films are better, but Spider-Man 3 is an amazing ending to this trilogy, and if they decide to make a 4, 5, and 6, I hope they can be as epic and as interesting as these films were.7.5/10","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It becomes bloated, with a plot that's only a tiny bit more interesting than watching grass grow. After watching this movie, I have to wonder...why was it even made? Have we gotten to the point where a movie can be created with the same mentality as a TV show created to round out a season? Did they create this one just so they could release some sort of Spiderman title for '07? Yes. This movie was recycled from the previous 2 movies with worse acting, musical composition, editing...everything. All in a longer package. Great. Save your money, buy the DVD if you must, and fast forward through the boring filler. In fact, just skip to the end, and don't watch how the Sandman story resolves itself. Simply terrible. On the plus side, I suppose the air conditioning didn't die during the agonizing 140 minutes. Great.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

The movie undoubtedly has its qualities, but unfortunately also some weaknesses.At the beginning it seems that Peter has found his balance. He is happy and everything is going as it should. This is how it looks at first glance. It doesn't take long and you realize that his success is going over his head and he's getting cocky. Of course, this is human to a certain extent, yet he becomes arrogant and suddenly everything is no longer running smoothly.The movie really has its strengths. Starting with Sandman. He's not an evil person, but is still a criminal by his actions. Supposedly good intentions do not justify crimes. For me this is really interesting figure.The Symbiont and Venom are of course also highlights of the movie.But now we come to the biggest minus point. Peter's new hairstyle, his overly arrogant behavior and especially his ridiculously embarrassing dancing moves. What the hell is this? I know what this is trying to symbolize, but it's just too much and anything but believable. These inserts seem like foreign bodies in the movie.Peter's ego could have been portrayed much better and more credibly at this point. Up to this point the movie war really good.The final fight with Venom was epically staged and fun. However, the final exit was meager and didn't do justice to the entire previous performance. You feel that the maximum running time of the movie was reached and a cut had to be made.Overall, we are talking about a very successful trilogy. The last part also had its highlights, but it couldn't keep up with the first two parts.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Its pretty hard to ruin one of these movies, and yet this one was ridiculously gluttonous and completely left the Spiderman formula, that was working, behind.Let me start with the positive. The special effects were top rate. When you compare the special effects from Spidey 3 to Spidey 1 there is quite a leap. Sandman was just incredible to watch when he was on screen, though note to directors, lets chill on the Thomas Haden Church close ups, I wanted to hand him some lip balm and face moisturizer! Venom was a little more cartoony, where Sandman was just visually cool. So the special effects team, top marks.As for the movie itself, look its 140 minutes I will never have back. Peter Parker sings and dances in a jazz club for crying out loud. We have to endure Kirsten Dunst singing. We have to endure the introduction and set up of Flint Marko (Sandman, Eddie Brock (Venom), and Gwen Stacy. The only one I felt was handled appropriately was Gwen Stacy, and thats only because she was a lesser character therefore she didn't really require as much. And and the vengeful Harry Osborne (New Green Goblin?)into the mix and you have a movie that is very reminiscent of the god awful ""Batman and Robin"" with all those cast of characters they seemed to try to ram down your throat. ENOUGH.As a result of this decision to inundate us with new characters, and still try to intertwine the troubled love story between Peter and MJ (I just don't care about by the way), the movie over reached. It couldn't pull it all together. What is needed is to go back to the one villain format with the angst of life on this. We attach ourselves to the problems of Peter's personal life. But you can't properly take care of that aspect with an interesting angle on his personal life AND properly take care of the real thing everyone came to see. Spiderman fighting the bad guy.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

Over the last few years movies that have been over hyped have failed to live up to audience expectations. So does Spiderman 3 live up to the hype?The purpose of trailers is to draw audiences to watch the movie by showing captivating scenes from the movie. In action movies it's the most action packed scenes that we see. However, the thing about trailers is that they can't help judge how good the storyline and plot of the movie is. Producers and marketing executive have banked on this philosophy for the past few years. We all agree that the Spiderman 3 trailers got us fired up for the movie but how good is the story? Let's start with the good thingsThe action sequences were superb The action sequences were the best of all the Spiderman movies and probably the best to grace the movie screens. The fights were awesome They tried to incorporate comedy in the movie that works They tried to incorporate more light comedy into the movie than all the other Spiderman movies that actually works.The element of surprise Some scenes literary jolted me off my seat. I liked that.Sorry, that was all that was good about the movieI have to admit that when I heard that there were going to be three bad guys in the movie that got me fired up. Being the ultimate Spiderman fan, I swore that I was going to see it as soon as it hit the cinema. But it's because of these three bad guys in one movie that the storyline and plot are patheticIt doesn't fully pick up where it left off In Spiderman 2, Peter was struggling to balance school, a job, being Spiderman and love. He was failing miserably and this was made him unsure of his powers and ultimately was the reason he was losing them. In Spiderman 3, he's able to quite easily without an explanation of how.Plot and Storyline are messed up!!! The storyline doesn't flow. It's crowded with too many subplots. It's like a collection of short stories about Spiderman mixed together to form one. It's annoying because one story is barely over before another starts. If you were told to explain what goes on during the movie from start to finish, trust me, you wouldn't be able.There is too much coincidence Movies like this about coincidence, that I know, but the way it occurs in this movie sheds light on the fact that the writers did a bad job. It's like they were patching up things using coincidence so that the story would work.Some aspects of the movie aren't complete but the movie still moves on. Coming back to an earlier point, some things that happen during the movie aren't settled even to the end. I would like to give examples but I don't want to spoil for those who haven't watched.The main problem with the movie is that they tried to do too much in one movie. I understand that this was supposed to be the last one but not in the expense of making a good movie. I would have preferred if Spiderman went out with a bang.The most disappointing thing about the movie is the lack of strong themes and a strong message. If they were there they weren't brought out well.The music could have been better. I believe most producers and directors don't pay much attention to this but it's very important. More could have been done about this.If you want to know whether to watch it on big screen, its simple; that's the only way you'll enjoy the movie. The special effect and action sequences make it worth big screen.However, if you want to watch it on small screen it's not worth it unless you have a home theatre. It was an attempt by producers to buy audience using the expensive special effects rather than a good story, themes and message.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's nowhere near the 7.3 it's reflecting right now! I would recommend that anybody who wants to see this should wait for DVD. Aside from CG effects (some of which look fake anyway), the film is quite empty. There are too many villains, first of all. B/c of the number, they end up being half-developed and lacking character. There's inconsistency as to why there's even a meltdown in MJ's and Peter's relationship. Characters also completely act out of character.If you want to see a review that's dead-on, read the one posted in the S.F. Chronicle by Mick LaSalle.

And if we're not just hopping on the bandwagon this movie isn't out of place in the trilogy. I mean they all have stupid and goofy stuff this isn't its first time around the block. Yeah, the movie has too many villains and they all fight for the spotlight at the very end but, Sandman really gets the golden treatment for this movie. Venom just kind of gets shoe-horned in there but Sandman has a really good story and just kills it. Also Black Suit Spiderman is really dope. The entire train fight sequence is so cool and I don't think any other Spiderman movie can ever replicate that kind of badass stuff. The action as a whole is better. As well as the CGI which could rival some movies today.

"7","/10","It's not bad. There's too much going on, but it's still entertaining","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2636569/?ref_=tt_urv","Movie_Muse_Reviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2496397/?ref_=tt_urv","2 July 2012","After two wildly success movies, Sony's ""Spider-Man"" franchise led by director Sam Raimi seemed as if it could do no wrong. My, how spoiled we were by ""Spider-Man"" and ""Spider- Man 2"" that we could be so naive.""Spider-Man 3"" isn't bad, just ambitious and convoluted. Like its predecessors, the story and screenplay's primary focus remains on Peter Parker/Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire), the man trying to balance being a student, a boyfriend and New York's No. 1 crime-fighter, and how his new journey will change his perspective on playing all those parts. It's the smallest juggling act of all, however, compared to the plot of this movie.""Spider-Man 3"" features three villains and four romances between five people. The numbers pretty much say it all there as far as the notion of ""too much going on"" is concerned. There's no reason a similar core story couldn't be told with half as many subplots, and as such the resulting story reeks of studio interference.The first big-screen appearance of Venom is certainly the big selling point, but if the core of the story is the sun, the story of Venom and Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) is Saturn. The symbiote arrives via meteor shower early on, but doesn't latch on to Peter until an hour into the film (nearly halfway). Venom doesn't rear his sinister head until the 100-minute mark (that's all the time most films get). So ... did anyone really want to include Venom in this film?You don't get the sense that Raimi did. Sure, he and fellow writers Ivan Raimi (his brother) and Alvin Sargent find a way to genuinely connect the symbiote subplot to Peter's journey in the film and make it seem as if Venom's appearance is essential to this story, but it has no weight or power — just a lot of great visual effects work.The character of Flint Marko a.k.a. Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) comes off more like a Raimi kind of character. Like Dr. Octopus, and even in a sense Green Goblin before him, Sandman is a sympathetic villain as his motivation is to find the money to make his ill young daughter well again. But as with the film's many parts that show promise, the juggling act stunts it almost completely. Church's character and performance comes across as one- dimensional, especially after he disappears for the entire middle act.The other reason he would've been a fine choice as a solo villain is the way he's linked into the murder of Uncle Ben. To Raimi, Peter has never been able to get over the guilt of incidentally bringing about his uncle's death, and Marko's role in it complicates things for Peter emotionally. This story line provides the one true sense of continuity between the three films and could have potentially put a rounded punctuation mark and emotional note on Raimi's trilogy, but rather than have two characters who badly misunderstand each other duking it out, Venom has to join the party.Oh, have I not mentioned the third villain yet? As suggested in the second film's conclusion, Harry Osborn (James Franco) takes on the mantle of the New Goblin to avenge his father's death and kill Spider-Man, who he knows is Peter. Rather than talk it out with his best friend, he finds him on the street and tries to kill him. This whole subplot — despite being a thrilling action sequence — feels like unfinished business from the second film rather than an integral part of the third. In fact, it results in Harry suffering amnesia, at least as long as it takes to focus on developing the other subplots in the film before vengeful Harry becomes necessary again.Pause from the criticism to praise how high the action and visual effects bar is raised between ""Spider-Man 2"" and ""Spider-Man 3."" The CGI looks excellent and the early action scenes showcase Spider-Man doing aerial stunts like we'd never imagined.The other crowning achievement of the franchise has been the romance. We knew the fact that Peter and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) finally came together at the second film's end wouldn't be so happily ever after, but now suddenly they are out of touch with each other's feelings and afraid to tell each other the truth despite MJ knowing Peter's biggest secret. After getting fired from her new show, MJ devolves into a needy and jealous character and Peter has let the fame of being Spider-Man get to his head. These qualities didn't exist before in these characters, but suddenly they do. To complicate matters, Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) comes between them as well. The story of the symbiote is meant to exacerbate their relationship problems, just as it does all the other subplots of the film. Actually, that is about as connected as it all ever gets. The symbiote suit is Peter's choice, and it has consequences throughout each element of the movie.This is Emo Peter's cue. The symbiote naturally has a negative influence on Peter, but rather than simply amplifying aggression or other emotions, it makes him cocky. Raimi gives Maguire this emo look and films him walking down the street handing out catcalls land doing a dance routine in the jazz club where MJ works to make her jealous. Raimi has never shied away from humor, but these scenes are tonally light years away from the rest of the film not to mention the franchise, and they sour nearly the whole movie experience.It's easy to deconstruct the problems of ""Spider-Man 3,"" however, and harder to admit that it's an engaging film with good intentions. Minus the emo sequences, it's just a disappointment, though it didn't have to be. If only there weren't an impossible amount going on, or at least someone told any of the film's creative minds that obvious fact beforehand.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Simmons, Bryce Dallas Howard and Dylan BakerGenre: Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi/ThrillerRated: PG-13It was 3 years after they released Spider-Man 2 and now there's Spider-Man 3. The first 2 Spider-Man movies were good and there were high expectations for this movie. So in this movie, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has finally managed to balance his relationship with Mary Jane (Kristen Dunst) and his responsibility as Spider-Man while Harry Osborn (James Franco) is out for his revenge (with a new green goblin suit) on Peter for killing his father while Spider-Man is trying to take down Flint Marko/Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) for killing his uncle. Peter Parker loses all hope until his suit turns black and becomes stronger and faster but effects his behavior with a darker attitude. Also we finally get to see Venom (Topher Grace) on the big screen after long awaited! This movie is alright but not the best out of the whole series. I really think that putting Sandman in this movie wasn't necessary, I thought Venom should have had more screen time and I thought this movie had too many sub- plots to it. Plus I didn't like it how they made Peter Parker so emo to the point where he acted like a little whiny bitch. Other than those nit picks, I thought the movie was alright but if they're going to go for a fourth movie then they need to not make so many sub-plots and stick to the main story.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

C'mon Sam Raimi, give the damned screenplay and writing to someone else. You are an excellent director, but your writing sucks. Where was venom? WHY DIDN'T HE TALK LIKE VENOM? Venom had a bit part, when in the comic he was central. I guess cramming 2 and a half villains (""New"" Goblin doesn't count as a whole villain of course) in a feature-length film would require a bit of choppiness to the flow, which was what happened. A sad event to a character here, anger there. And what was with spidey in the symbiote suit? He looked like an emo kid. Ahh... isn't darkness and anger metal's realm? I may be nit-piking but emo kids usually spend a lot of the time tear-dropping, and not kicking all sorts of ass and being belligerent. Am I really that out of touch with kids these days? *sigh*By the way, Tobey McGuire did a fantastic job of acting out the anger and in-your-face attitude that comes with Evil Spidey. Well played, indeed. Whoever painted his face up and combed his hair and picked out his clothes should be shot. Repeatedly. I guess I'm just disappointed that the movie doesn't capture that same feeling of the human condition the first one did, and to a lesser extent, the second. I remember having feelings like parker did all the time when I was younger, dealing with all this crap at once. Now it appears that on top of all that he has an alien suit and a sandman to deal with. And, of course, what would a Spider-Man Movie be without a bunch of Mary Jane drama. What a load.The effects were pretty decent, I had the pleasure of not watching it in the theater (this strips movies of their ""shock"" value of the effects). Without 200 decibel, bass-heavy sounds you can really pay attention to the overall feel of the effects. Hooray for higher poly counts. Great. Whatever. The sand looks like sand. And, in many places, moves a lot like it. Whoopity-doo. Venom's spaztic and evil movements were pretty neat in my opinion, I'd like to attribute that to art directors and story board artists, and Todd McFarlane of course.Overall, comic book movies are reverting to the bland, cheesy, boring, cardboard crap the 80s vomited forth. Where's Dolph Lundgren? I can't wait for Transformers from Michael Bay, it might just be the knife in the coffin that sends the comic book movies back into hibernation just as the punishers and supermans did in the 80s. Christopher Nolan, we need you now!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

So i will make it quick. Allow me to start with, I liked the first Spiderman. I DID NOT like the second one. The CGI was horrible. I do agree that the original Green Goblin looked like something from the POwer Rangers, but the first one was good. So tonight I went to the 12:01 a.m. showing with a friend who really wanted to see it.We are returned to spidey(Toby Maguire) and his girl MJ (Kirsten Dunst, ick) and how wonderfully in love they are. Harry is still not happy with spidey/peter for killing his dad. MJ is performing on Broadway in a musical (with a not so good voice) and Spidey has become the savior of the city. It seems as though nothing could go wrong, but.... OUt of the blue, Harry decides he needs to seek revenge on spidey for the death of his father and becomes the New Green Goblin guy. A fight ensues, Spidey wins, knocks Harry unconscious, BAM he has forgotten the fact that Spidey stole his girlfriend (that he was too afraid to talk to in the first one, so I'm so on Harry's side here) and that he thinks spidey killed his father. All is well. The three are BFF. Enter Sandman/Flint Marko. Marko is an escaped felon with a sick daughter. The police inform spidey and aunt may that flint is the one who murdered uncle ben. This angers Spidey. Between all of this enter Gwen Stacy (played by a wonderful Bryce Dalas Howard) who is the daughter of the police chief and whom spidey saves and kisses (MJ gets mad). Throughout this some strange black goo hits earth from the sky, climbs to spidey and overcomes him. Flint Marko becomes sandman by some freak accident involving, guess this.....sand. Spidey becomes his own enemy and turns bad for a while, MJ and Spidey have some problems and topher grace is the only reason worht going to see this film as Eddie Brock.Cenom who is in love with Gwen. There are more corny lines in this movie than in all the national lampoon movies and American pie movies combined. The audience is supposed to be on spidermans side, especially when harry tries to steal MJ back, but really, what kind of friend steals his best friends girlfriend and keeps his identity a secret. I""m on Harry's side and i understand where topher grace's character is coming from. He gets called a fraud, but wtf is spidey, how does peter get pictures? I found this film ridiculous, in all honesty. THere are really stupid dance scenes. Corny one liners, the plot has too many villains and do not develop any of them enough for you to not want the to win. I know this will be the top grossing film of the year, which makes me sad. Because this film seems to have had no thought go into it, and some pretty rough acting by maguire and dunst. A movie for the kids, maybe.Rated PG 13 for violence. 140 minutes.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

I really liked Harry. I thought he did a really good job acting and he was a pleasant surprise at the end. However, two thing REALLY bothered me: 1)The parts in the street with Peter dancing and flirting were so lame, I wish they were not in the film.

Rewatching it with a fresh outlook on film and being less judgmental than I used to be, I found myself enjoying it far more than I originally did. How they handled Venom was immensely disappointing when I first watched it, but now that we have a more proper Venom film, I can see the merit in this one. Besides, who doesn't love Topher Grace? He seems born to have played the polar opposite of Tobey Maguire, who I never loved as Peter Parker but thought he was a decent enough fit. That said, the weird and comical manner in which they portrayed Venom through Parker was odd, but Eddie Brock's ""version"" was much more satisfying. The ethically conflicted villain played by Thomas Hayden Church was great, and James Franco surprisingly effective both humorously and seriously. Then there's Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy, perhaps my biggest reason for giving this a rewatch. And I'm not the least bit disappointed. Action and effects wise, everything was phenomenal especially for '07. Structurally the movie was kind of all over the place and way too long, but pacing never felt like an issue. Inferior to its predecessors but still very entertaining; and I'm not really a big Spider-Man fan to begin with.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The writing for this film is beyond mediocre and insults my intelligence as a film and comic book aficionado. All of the characters in Spider-man 3 do not interact as normal human beings would in real life. This hurts the emotional connection you're supposed to make with Peter Parker, Mary Jane and Harry Osborn. This stems from someone who does not understand how to write real characters into a script. These are not the same characters who I loved watching in the first two films, these are imposters. It seems even the actors know they are in a bad film because they give a boring and dishonest performance. One of the reasons people go to see a Spider-man film is because of the creative villains. In Spider-man 3 both the Sandman and Venom get cheated out of screen time to serve the purpose of continuing the badly written love triangle between the main characters. The only time I smiled and was mildly interested was when Aunt May gave Peter advice or when J.J. was doing his comedic part. Sadly they get very little screen time as well.I think Spider-man 3 was ironically the end of Spider-man for all the die-hard fans that turned up for the superior Spider-man 1 and 2.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

I liked it when I watched it the first time especially, the evil Peter Parker (he was the best interpretation how the symbiote will affect that version of Peter Parker). Then, the death of Harry was inevitable and necessary. Three villains were the best thing that happened to the movie. One redeemed and sacrificed himself, one was not entirely evil but need made him evil and he sided with the good, the third one was the true villain but even he had layers as Eddie Brock. Had there been a Spider-Man 4, we would have gotten characters that could have been leaps and bound richer, character wise cuz this was the base. One aspect is that this movie was kind of a turning point in Peter Parker's life as he became more mature. Other technical aspects like cinematography, editing, VFX were top notch.This movie is slowly turning into a classic and still being talked about extensively, for good or for worse. And it still will.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

By now, you should know the plot overview. Instead of a lone antagonist, the movie has opted to feature three villains. Yes, three villains! As if properly weaving three villains into the storyline was not already a lofty goal, the movie decides to dip its entire arm into the cookie jar by centralizing Peter Parker's rocky relationship with Mary-Jane Watson. In between the confrontations and fights, you will be treated to moments of tension between Peter and Mary-Jane as well as moments of lunacy on Peter's end.The movie's main problem is that it's overly ambitious. It seems that the production team wanted to cram as much as possible in 140 minutes. In doing so, a few of the characters were left largely undeveloped, the transitions from scene to scene were, at times, rough and absolutely lacking in style, and the plot eventually crumbles as it progresses.Do not get me wrong, though, the movie is entertaining. If anything, the movie's truly spectacular moments comes in the form of its action scenes. Believe me, the fight scenes are much better when compared to the movie's predecessors. The action choreography and the visual effects have been refined to near-perfection. Every hard hit and slow-motion event serves well in drawing you into the experience. The acting was all right. Rosemary Harris shined as Aunt Mae. On the lower end of the scale, however, Tobey Maguire stunk. Most of his 'sad' scenes had the whole audience in my theater laughing, what with his contorted facial expressions and all.Lastly, I have to comment on the movie's message. The theme here is revenge and evil. The movie brilliantly extends its theme to cover not only Peter, but the villains as well. However, any potential for a poignant perspective on revenge or hatred is shattered at the movie's childish treatment of such a deep subject. To summarize, the movie basically has this to say about revenge: ""LOL, like, revenge makes U da evil!""Despite being a good film, I have to nominate this as the worst Spider-Man in the series as of so far.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Like most of the sequels Spider Man 3 could not, unfortunately, excel its antecedent Spider Man 2. Alas, Sam Raimis Spidey is caught in the web of too many foes this time- foes forcibly cut and pasted from the history of Spider Man 1( Sandman), and foes cosmetically invented. Like Dickens novels the movie has too many threads to be handled by the viewer. Obviously one or the other thread would be left untied in the end. There would be no other option amidst yawning audience in 2 hours 20 minutes duration but to feel bored at times. Character wise Mary J Watson disappoints through out the movie by means of her egocentric-ism. However it is Peter Parker/Spider Man who shines in his negative energy. Also the variety of shades in Harry Osbornes character are occupying. Although there is a feeling of fragmentation throughout the movie. Yet it could be lauded, clapped for and recommended because it seems to be propagating what is known as humanism. Remember Spider Man 3 is strictly an art NOT for arts sake. It is something beyond. The villainous projection of each bad man like Sandman and Venom is sort of justified in the light of human nature. Their demeanour though is loathsome, their psyche is never the same. We hate them not as we did Green Goblin or Dr. Octavius. And more ironically , perhaps for the first time viewers frown at hero and sympathize villains. However Spider Man 3 could be watched for its thrilling action sequences and portrayal of contradictions of human life.Sam Raimis 3rd Spidey is not as weak as the first part but nor is more stronger than the 2nd.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Kirsten Dunst and James Franco are great once again and J. K. Simmons continues to steal all of his scenes. Thomas Hayden Church is really good but sadly, Topher Grace is a pretty weak villain who lacks any screen presence.Sam Raimi's direction is great, his trademark sensibilities are still present and there's some extremely impressive action sequences, despite the annoyingly inconsistent CG.

I didn't care about anyone in this movie, not the guy not the girl. I didn't care if the guy got the girl. Well I did care about one person and largely because he's a very good actor and his character had the most depth, guess who? Harry. He was the only likable character of the main trio. Who else did I like? Gwen & Venom - also more depth. I really liked Venom. It's funny in a movie where you are supposed to be rooting for the heroes I was rooting for Venom and Harry. How odd. If they were to do this movie again, they should get a better story, one where you actually care about the characters. What's with the marriage plot? They are like 25. Average age to get married in this society 30. It was like a plot from 1910 or trying to marry people off at 18. In a movie, movies about marriage don't really cut it unless they are for 12 year olds, epics or romantic comedies with lots of crude fart jokes. I hate when they do this. They did it to superman: lois and clark. That was such a great show but then they tried to make superman a daddy. The action was great in this film but in the final action scene, I found myself saying 'is it over?' why because I didn't care. And also it didn't make sense. I mean Harry lives through being smashed against a brick wall, falling 50 feet, and a killer explosion with only second degree burns. Like come on. Spiderman saved him in the beginning in two seconds by rushing him to a hospital, like he couldn't manage that again in the 10 minutes of sap. He certainly had enough time.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

The story is my least favorite out of the three but it's still good considering Sam Raimi was forced to add a storyline he didn't want to. The only villain was supposed to be Sandman but he was forced to add Venom. If you ask me, the Venom storyline is just as good as the Sandman side of the story. It also has more stakes than the first two. It's still as attracting as the first two. It also keeps its responsibility theme. The acting is still great considering the dialogue and certain scenes (the fans know what I'm talking about) can be pretty corny. The cinematography is really similar to the 2nd movie while both of them are very different from the 1st. The editing and pacing is similar to the 2nd even though some scenes just shouldn't be in there at all. The effects are still great! And it's sound, especially for Venoms screeching is awesome. And of course... it keeps the amazing and iconic score. While I wouldn't say it's one of a kind like the first two, Sam still did an amazing job after what he was given. 9.0/10!

The villains (mostly venom)2. Bully MaguireThe Sandman doesn't have a reason to be against Spider-Man. He doesn't want to hurt Spider-Man. He just wants to steal money and be on his way. For example, Green Goblin WANTED Spider-Man dead, causing HIM to chase spidey. I Eddie Brock is the only one who wants Spider-Man dead, but that is a smaller plot line that we all can agree is pretty weak. Now, Spider-Man is also not worried about chasing the Sandman. He has found the venom symbiote and has transitioned in ""Bully Maguire"" he is driven by his own ego and his ultimate goal is to make Mary Jane miserable. Peter Parker is a villain. The resolution to the movie is Peter realizing that he needs to forgive others and do what is right. The theme of this movie is forgiveness. Harry Osborn forgives Peter for killing his father, and Peter forgives the Sandman for killing uncle Ben. In the end, this is more than just some superhero movie. Its an emotional tale of redemption.

He has the woman of his dreams (who is making her debut on Broadway by the way); his freelance photographer job has him getting paid with some consistency, and there are even rumblings that a staff position could be open soon; and on top of all that, when he wears his pajamas in public, everyone adores him. Spider-Man 3 starts out all rainbows and lollipops for Peter and his friendly neighborhood alter-ego, but anyone who is a long time fan of Spider-Man knows the good times never last. Complicating Peter's moving-towards-perfect life are a former best friend who wants him dead, a grease ball of a photographer gunning for his job, and a little alien glob looking for a good time. Unfortunately for director Sam Raimi and co-writers Ivan Raimi and Alan Sargent, the problems with the script far out weigh any troubles Spidey is about to encounter.Spider-Man 3 suffers from the same problem that many comic book sequels do  trying so hard to out-do your predecessors that you feel the need to add more villains, rather than focusing on the story-telling that made the original so good. In this movie we get Sandman, Venom, New Goblin (VERY creative) as well as Dark Spidey himself. The charm of the original story was that we got to know our hero and villain as people before we saw them with powers. With this many new characters, that evolution is lost, necessitating quick set-ups that turn the aggressors into cardboard cut outs and stereotypes. On top of that, while trying to force the action and origins of the villains, we get contrived set ups that bend our imagination to the limits. I'm all for ""Suspension of Disbelief"" when seeing a movie, but don't try to get me to suspend my intelligence and just accept what you're offering no questions asked. And therein lies the biggest flaw of Spider-Man 3.The storytellers expect you to take enormous leaps of faith with the story, asking you to blindly accept some major coincidences and convenient timing to keep the story moving forward. In example (and don't worry  no spoilers here), we're expected to believe that the experiment that eventually turns Flint Marko into Sandman is happening at a very insecure location close to New York, that it is not being visually monitored, and even when a scientist notices an abnormality before the experiment begins his report is ignored. The movie is riddled with inconsistencies like that, which makes the experience less enjoyable.What IS enjoyable about Spider-Man 3 are select performances, and the humor Sam Raimi weaves throughout the picture to break the tension. Tobey Maguire is allowed to have a lot more fun as Peter Parker, first allowing the city's love of his alter ego to go to his head. Then when that alien glob connects itself to Peter and starts playing upon some of his less admirable traits, Maguire shines. He's lovably out of place as a nerd with an attitude, then eerily overconfident when showing off to anyone who will pay attention. And it's even better when Spider-Man loses the conscience of Peter Parker.Topher Grace is a perfect anti-Parker as Eddie Brock. Cocky, uncaring for anyone but himself, and willing to do whatever he can to move his vision of a perfect life forward. You hate this guy almost from the get-go, and that's a good thing. Thomas Hayden Church's turn as Sandman doesn't give him much material to work, and every time they try to get a tear out of us for this unfortunate man, it leaves you rolling your eyes instead. For the lighter moments, J.K. Simmons reprising his role as Daily Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson is a godsend. He embodies everything Spider-Man fans over the years have loved to hate about J-J-J over the years. And a nice turn by Raimi favorite Bruce Campbell in a small role as the maitre d' at a snooty French restaurant is priceless.The other thing to love about the movie is the special effects. Marko's transformation into Sandman is really eye popping. The CGI for that character is extremely consistent and very appealing throughout the film. Raimi's direction through the action sequences is good, but it would be nice to start things off a little slow and build up to the quick cutting flights through the cityscape, rather than hitting us with that right out of the box. The first views of Venom left me wanting more, but the real problem is that there was no emotion in the villain's face, so anytime they wanted the creature to have a real conversation, they were forced peel back the costume and let Topher do the talking.There are a lot of holes in this film with which I had problems. Like where did the Spidey Sense disappear? If Harry's lone obsession is destroying Parker, then why is he going to a play? How does Brock know about Marko's power? And the biggest problem I have with just about every comic book movie  if these characters went 30, 40, even 50 years in print without anyone knowing their secret identities, why are there multiple people in every film that figure it out? But despite all those holes and inconsistencies, I have to say I enjoyed this movie. If you can grind your way through the long lapses in action, you will really enjoy it when you arrive. And for comic fans that have emotional attachments to these characters, some of the moments will have you cheering, and even squirming. Spider-Man 3 pales in comparison to its predecessors, but I still recommend you see it, rating it a 6.5 out of 10","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Sure it was really messy, has pacing issues and tried to fit too many things but it was a good movie. Certainly not as good as the other 2 and has aged the worst in terms of visuals but it works and is perfectly watchable.If Spider-Man 2 was the burden of the mask then Spider-Man 3 is the arrogance that comes with fame, which has mixed result. The Emo Parker scene is almost universally hated but its my absolute favorite part of the movie and one of my favorite moments in any Spider-Man media be it movies, games, cartoon, animated or even comics. I will always love that part of the movie and maybe thats why I'm more fond of this movie than most other.Obvious problem was Venom which was just bad, it was absolutely unwatchable and its such a shame too since so far Sam Raimi has nailed the essence of every Spider-Man villain up until now. Compared to Tom Hardy Venom this is the equivalent of Facepaint Deadpool from the Wolverine movie.But everything else was fine. And its not as bad as people remember it to be.

More villains than the first two combined, SF that are breath taking and the spider get a new cool suit. Sadly it seems that despite the much larger budget than the first two, that the money came right out of the fund for the script. This is apparent in the ending or should I say endings. The script is so weak that it takes three fade-outs to tie up the most of the storyline and still you feel like something is missing, but luckily at this point in the movie, you have already stopped paying attention to the storyline. What ( I believe) is the problem with the storyline, is not, that it is all that bad but someone got something wrong, and wrote a movie that was supposed to be an hour longer. Then higher up someone said ""hmm we've already spent too much money on SF let just cut out all the cool parts and epic scenes, and make a movie out of those."" The end product became a movie that never builds any suspense and the web that holds the plot together is so weak, that the motives of both the heroes and the villains feels unreal, You never feel any empathy with any of them, with the two first movies really had going for them.The only thing left to comment is the characters. Mary Jane has suddenly completely changed from being a sweet, fresh, smiling girl, that is vibrant and always in touch with life, to something quit the opposite. In this movie she is weak, repressed and just depressing to watch. Peter Parker on the other hand changes his personality several times i the movie, signified by a different hairstyle and a bit of eyeliner (real subtle). This could have been cool but it just looks like a bad The Mask impersonation and make Parkers meeting with the dark side look like a joke.","37 out of 81 found this helpful.

At times some of the explosions from the green goblin no.2's grenades were hilariously bad. Also, the girder smashing through the building, again, hilariously bad. Blatant greenscreen at times also and some terrible backgrounds. Then there was the film. Overlong, stupid and forced performance by Maguire, the moneys gone to that ones head....Didn't the plot just plod and plod and plod?! It felt like a better movie on pause, seriously. I was just sitting in the theatre and the good side of my movie viewing brain was rotting, ever so slightly. Who wrote the script for this?! It was very funny, that it was so pathetically written 80% of the way. 'You gotta get back on the horse MJ.' 'oh don't gimme the horse thing again.' Classy. I mean haha, I've heard better dialogue in porn. Then like all the dialogue was about the woes of MaryJane. Reiterated about 20 times. Yawwwwwwwwn. We don't care. WE DON'T CARE. Story was superbly boring. Simply one of the dullest action movies I have ever seen. Not even saved by the action sequences. Which were generally weak, to short and very repetitive choreography wise. The action sequences came out of nowhere quelling my interest in them whatsoever and the score for the film did little to get the blood pumping. The action just felt sub par the whole way through. venom was a little pussy with no personality. Definitely a poor, poor screen treatment. What was Raimi thinking? Before seeing this I felt a little disappointed at hearing rumours that Maguire wouldn't want to be in anymore spiderman films. Now I think his explanation that it felt like a trilogy is more a nice way of saying I don't want to be in this film. Hell, maybe he performaed so annoyingly badly on purpose so as to give a more competent actor a chance in the role of spidey. If this ends as a trilogy its been a weak finish.Summed up in less lines: Weak baddies, weak fights, a slow, slithering pace. poor performances all round save for maybe James Franco. Script could have gone through many more drafts. So much unnecessary bits in there. Scores a couple points for the bit where parker has the venom power.4/10 Sorry about the convoluted way in which I sum things up here. The special effects were my first gripe upon hearing some reviewer had raved about how spectacular they were.","13 out of 24 found this helpful.

It turned out that self-conflict portion wasn't that a big part of the story afterall. The goo falling out of the sky was very interesting. I would have like to know more about it, where it comes from, and the way that it bring the darkside of someone. Well, maybe in SM4. I felt that actor was not a good choice to play Venom. I can't find hatred in that face, or just bad acting. Another problem I find is that this one has more lame dialogues than the previous 2 movies, some of the lamest. Nevertheless, it does have some of the best action sequences that I'd seen, awesome actions.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was so boring with cheesy SFX, the camera shook a lot during the action scenes which really made me dizzy especially when Peter & Harry were fighting for the first time. Do not mistake that the third is the best because it's not, that is what I thought as well but the best is the second. The film looked really amazing in the trailer with 3 villains but I was more interested in Venom not Harry or the Sandman because Harry is just the same as his dad in the first one and the Sandman is a similarity to the T-1000 in Terminator 2, but unfortunately Venom hardly appeared for about 10 minutes. The first appearance of all 3 villains was awful; the whole film is far too slow with a lot of useless scenes and lacks a decent story. It is supposed to be the most expensive film ever with a budget of $250 million but there is hardly anything I can see that looks expensive. The only thing I enjoyed in the cinema hall was my popcorn & juice and when it all ran out I went to get some more although I never do that but I wanted to save myself from boredom.","22 out of 45 found this helpful.

"9","/10","The rumors are true - Spidey 3 is the best of the lot!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1644487/?ref_=tt_urv","saarvardi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2812446/?ref_=tt_urv","26 April 2007","By now you've all probably heard the rumors about the quality of Sam Raimi's latest addition to the pantheon of big-screen adaptations for comic book classics (aka Spider-Man 3). If not, let me give it to you straight and simple: they are all true.Spider-Man 3 is the best film of the Spider-Man trilogy to date. In fact, it's bigger and better than its predecessors on so many levels; I don't even know where to begin. It's in this third installment of the series that the director allows the now matured and established characters to fully realize themselves. By doing so, Spider-Man 3 becomes a plot-driven piece of film, alongside being your lovable big-budget summer uber-buster as well. It is this cinematic achievement that'll make future audiences admire this film long after its initial box-office impact will worn off. And trust me; this will be an enormous hit from a mile if I've ever seen one (note that this review is typed on Thursday, April 26th, 8 days before Spider-Man 3's US premier, after I had the pleasure of attending a special press screening in Ramat-Gan, Israel).The thing is, I've never been a big fan of the first Spider-Man. The second one was much better, in my opinion, but only after seeing it I realized how much the original was required in order to establish the three main characters - Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), Mare Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry Osborn (James Franco). This time around, this impossible love triangle finally dukes it out, as other character building devices, such as Osborn's oath to avenge his father's death, Parker's long yearning for MJ and his deterrence in finding anyone linked to his Uncle's death in part 1 - all reach a staggering crescendo, with some extremely dramatic consequences. On top of this all, Parker also has two brand new enemies to fight off - one of them being the alien form commonly referred to as Venom (Topher Grace in a nice change of style from his usual shenanigans) and the other being a small time escape con who by chance enters a scientific facility and is transformed into the Sandman (the always wonderful Thomas Hayden Church).At the end, it all comes down to a battle between good and evil, with messages of redemption and remorse playing a crucial role in the way the plot unfolds. The digital effects are at the top of their game as well, and entertain at the purest level of awesomeness (sorry, couldn't find a more subtle word). At some point, I remember telling my girlfriend what a great time I'm having - something I don't remember saying at the theater for some time now. Also, I am very glad the writers tried to close as much arcs as they could, making the trilogy as a whole smarter and more satisfying.As expected, Spidey 3 is not without its flaws, with many dialogs being somewhat cheesy and mostly clichéd (although it is a comic book adaptation, so don't expect Shakespeare), and a lot of the religious/patriotic themes were a little too much to bear. However, this all doesn't really matter that much when you're watching a film like Spider-Man 3. The main idea here is to sit back and enjoy, and hope Summer 2007 can maintain this level of quality throughout its upcoming blockbusters.","146 out of 297 found this helpful.

Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) seems to have everything going his way. His girlfriend (Kirsten Dunst) now knows he truly is the titled character and they are about to be wed. Plus her aspirations as a serious stage actress seem to be becoming reality while his college career continues to take flight. However, there are evil forces that loom in seemingly every direction. James Franco is back and still seeking revenge on his father's death which occurred at the conclusion of the original. An escaped convict (Thomas Haden Church), who might have had something to do with Maguire's uncle's death, has become some strange sort of super-villain after a strange accident that gives the character human/sand-like powers. Then we have an upstart cameraman (Topher Grace) who wants to steal Maguire's spotlight at work, and finally a strange cosmic black substance that attaches itself to entities of rage. Still with me? ""Spider-Man 3"" comes with too much baggage. The first two were heavy enough as they were, but this one is way too cute and smart for its own good. Too many side-stories, too many black and white characteristics of the major players and too many special effects-laden sequences that dull rather than excite cause this movie to be a gigantic bore of near epic proportions. It is saying a lot when B-movie ham Bruce Campbell, with his typical cameo, ends up being the most interesting and intriguing part of the whole flimsy production. 2.5 out of 5 stars.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

They were thrilling, fun, action-packed and the CGI was candy for the eyes... but the reason I loved them was they had solid stories with characters who weren't perfect, but you couldn't help but root for them anyway. That is what is lacking in Spider-Man 3 - the central story is extremely weak. It's like director Sam Raimi was throwing ideas at the wall and, if something stuck, he'd use it whether it helped move the narrative along or not.Don't get me wrong, there were plot lines that had a lot of potential. I think The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) could have been a great tragic anti-hero, along the lines of The Green Goblin and Doc Ock, if he had been given the proper treatment. He had an intriguing back-story, unfortunately that was abandoned early in the film to make way for snazzy effects. Granted, the scene where he is resurrected as a creature of sand is heartfelt, moving and the effects are breath-taking. The rest of the time he's in his sand form he's flying around New York City looking like a second cousin to the smoke monster on Lost. Ultimately, The Sandman is very one-dimensional because there isn't time to develop his character.I admit I was not a fan of Spider-Man before the movies. I've never read the comic book and most of my Spidey knowledge was obtained through wikipedia.com. But from what I understand, Venom is like The Joker in the Spider-Man universe. With that said, I'm surprised how one-note the writers, director Raimi and his brother Ivan, made the character. While The Sandman had a little bit of complexity and heart, Vemon was nasty just for the sake of being nasty. He had no redeeming qualities. Topher Grace was clearly having a great time shedding his ""good boy"" image, which made the character far more interesting than he deserved to be. In the hands of a less capable actor Venom would have fallen completely flat.As for the main characters in the film, I felt like I was watching the same actors playing totally different people. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) was rude, vain and arrogant. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) was solemn, mopey and secretive. In the first two movies I could see the mutual attraction they had for each other. I felt the spark. At the end of the Spider-Man 2, when Mary Jane tells Peter to, ""go get 'em, tiger""... it was all the proof I needed that these two were meant for each other. In Spider-Man 3 it seemed they didn't even like each other. Peter deliberately hurt Mary Jane by upside-down kissing newcomer Gwen Stacey (Bryce Dallas Howard) in front of hundreds of supporters (including MJ), and Mary Jane opened her heart to Harry Osbourne (brilliantly played by James Franco) without even considering Peter. I could see flashes of their original personalities towards the end of the film, but by then it was almost too late. Other characters (Aunt May - played by Rosemary Harris - and the previously mentioned Gwen Stacey) served little to no point in the movie and should have been left on the cutting room floor.The main plot was intriguing and would have been fantastic if it had been executed correctly. It wasn't. According to press releases and commercials we were going to see Peter's ""dark side"" after he comes into contact with a black, gooey substance from outer space that brings out a person's more aggressive qualities. I'm not sure we saw Peter's dark side as much as we saw his emo side. I was expecting Angelus (from season 2 of Buffy) and what I got was a skinny nerd with really bad hair strutting down the street, pointing at pretty girls, and dancing in a jazz club. I could tell Maguire was having a lot of fun, but Peter certainly didn't come off as mean or menacing. Again, I blame that on having too many pots on the stove. The climax of the movie (which puts Mary Jane in danger... again) was so ridiculous I felt like I was watching a big-screen version of that old video game, Rampage. And a deus ex machina near the end of the film was so contrived I'm amazed the characters didn't just speak directly to the audience. Toss in about 10 interesting but abandoned sub-plots (and a soap opera twist!) and you have a general idea of what to expect.Spider-Man 3 is basically two movies being smashed into one final product. And since it was just announced that there will be at least 3 more installments to the franchise I don't understand why Raimi felt the need to pack so much into 2 hours and 19 minutes. He should have held off on the dark Peter/Venom storyline and saved it for a later movie. He still had more than enough material for the third movie and he could have made it a character study worthy of it's predecessors.This isn't to say I had a horrible time or that the movie is a total disappointment. The special effects were dazzling, I laughed out loud more than once (courtsey of the hilarious J. K. Simmons and J. Jonah Jameson), there was plenty of ""edge-of-your-seat"" action and a few sequences were beautiful (especially at the end). Still, Spider-Man 3 could have been so much more than it was. But even with this small hiccup I hope the creative team (Raimi, Maguire and Dunst) return for the next three movies or the franchise will truly fall into ""Batman: The Schumacher Era"" territory. And that would be a shame. I draw the line at spider nipples!","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It had the greatest story of all three, which is very complex so some people might confuse it with being 'all over the place'. The acting was great, and Tobey's change in character, from good to evil, was interesting. The one thing I was disappointed in was the change in music conductors. It had a StarWars feel to it at some points. Other than that, the many characters had a real reason for their actions that made sense, the acting was great, some dialogue was very close to the comic's, and it had great action scenes with romance and touching moments. It is a must for any fan of Spider-man or someone looking for a great movie.","36 out of 65 found this helpful.

Many people who go to see spider-man swing around and capture the bad guys will be disappointed. Of the 140 minutes the movie takes up, he's in costume maybe 50 tops. The villains seem like they aren't really thought out, and even harry's turn seemed a bit rushed and tied up just for the sake of doing so.While the action sequences are great, they are still too far and few in between. Even with the wonderful planning of each one they all seem to have something a little off. Wither certain parts aren't really finished(the crane scene) or the civilians don't react at all the way they should for a giant sand monster and a vicious black monster without a name (the final battle).While the actual spider-man sequences were pretty well done, the peter parker scenes (more than 70% of the movie) seemed too drawn out and boring. While trying to be funny they seemed to have tried to hard and missed their mark (it was funner to make fun OF them)m when trying to be serious, it sometimes seemed over the top (and ended up being funnier than the comic relief). In the end the movie just seemed like it didn't know what it wanted to be: A good character piece or a great action movie. You are left with a sort of awkward feeling where you don't know when to laugh, when to be serious, when it's OK to call Peter stupid, or why it took the butler so long to open his mouth.overall nothing is really changed from the end of 2 except there are a few less people around to cause peter trouble, and it doesn't seem like MJ and Pete have made any progress.this movie suffers from over exposure, and trying to take on too much. If you don't buy into the hype you may be able to enjoy this, but if you've already taken it all in, you will be disappointed.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's essentially the best b-movie ever. I think the people making it have a really good sense of fun for the none too serious viewers and those with a sense of irony to bask in. Best action sequences ever, absolutely unbelievable. Never seen anything like it.I think the films work so much better than a lot of other superhero films because Sam Raimi has made the films appear as though the true story behind the myths of the comic books and has packed the films full of themes which hold it altogether. Also the direction is spot on and all the shots just seem like images from the comic books. The CGI team must be the best in the world too because it really is visual entertainment of the highest degree. See it, switch off your mind and enjoy it.","35 out of 63 found this helpful.

Some people are going to say that this is the best Spiderman yet. I know for certain it will beat out the first two films at the box office, but that still doesn't make it as good as Spiderman 2, and it's not quite on the same par as the first film either.The problem this time around is that there are entirely too many sub-plots and villains. The last two films dealt with only one villain, and that made it possible for character development. Doc Ock was still the best villain, but with this film we have three separate villains, and in a movie that was 2 and a half hours long, that still wasn't enough time to make them interesting.The main stars suffer a little bit here as well. The performance by Tobey Maquire wasn't as strong, and both Kirsten Dunst and James Franco were simply one note. I could tell that their performances were strained, and that only proves that the rumors may be true about the main stars not returning for part 4 if there is one.However, I must give kudos to the special effects. They were by far some of the best yet, and with a budget at over 250 million dollars, I can see why. But special effects alone do not make good movies. Character development and interesting story lines will always beat them out, and that is the part of the movie that rings a little hollow. There were also some nice action scenes, but even then there was nothing that really jumped out at you. Some of the scenes in Spiderman 3 were reminiscent of part 1 and 2. There was nothing original, and there were no wow scenes like the way Spiderman stopped the speeding train in part 2, or how he seemed to almost fly down the street on his web lines trying to catch the man who was thought to have killed his uncle in part 1.Sadly, Spidermen 3 doesn't quite make the grade, but I have no doubt it will still break box office records once its theater run is over.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The producers of the ""Batman"" movies found that well dry after Burton was replaced by Joel Schumacher, who made two awful films.Now Raimi's latest effort, ""Spider-Man 3,"" is here, and while it's nowhere near as catastrophic as, say, ""Batman & Robin,"" it's long, wan and tired in the vein of ""Superman Returns."" There's still a lightness of touch -- Raimi can reliably punctuate a film of this scale with skewed humor -- but the verve, the thrill, the razzle and the dazzle are all but gone. And I suspect people who love Spider-Man from the comic books will be more disappointed with it than people whose chief connection to him is through the movies.Raimi has all his stars back: Tobey Maguire in the title role, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane, James Franco as Harry, Rosemary Harris as Aunt May. They're joined by two new faces: Thomas Haden Church as career criminal Flint Marko who transforms into the Sandman, and Topher Grace, as Parker's career rival, Eddie Brock, who becomes the anti-Spider-Man known as Venom.They're all perfectly suited to their tasks: the strengths of Maguire, Dunst, Franco and Harris have been steady throughout the series; Church and Grace fit their roles nicely; and such stalwarts as J. K. Simmons, Elizabeth Banks and, especially, Bruce Campbell provide swell comic moments.But the comedy is surrounded by a lot of melodramatic storytelling, little of which truly compels: In addition to a romantic crisis with Mary Jane and a protracted effort to reconcile with Harry, Parker's host to an alien parasite that changes his personality, he learns that Marko is the real killer of his Uncle Ben, and he accidentally creates -- and then must vanquish -- Venom. And the action scenes, so impressive in the previous films, bring nothing new or especially memorable.""Spider-Man 3"" is a likable film -- Maguire's personality, or Raimi's channeled through him, is genuinely charming. But the tenor of the film is too often too muted, melancholy and enervated for something of its size. When Parker first figured out how to swoop through the city on his webs in the first film, it imparted a rush. But nothing here quite ever catches so big a breeze; far too often, it feels grounded, dutiful, dull. At the end, Parker is ambivalent about both his romance and his crime-fighting career. And I suspect that audiences might feel similarly uncertain about further Spider-Man adventures.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

In fact by the time I was sitting comfortably in my seat about to watch the movie I felt I had seen way too much of the movie already, and was actually pretty sick of seeing numerous Spiderman posters dotted around all over the place. However, despite ignoring my slight hesitations, despite realising it was never going to live up to hype over the movie, the ultimate disappointment of this movie is the fact it left me feeling empty. For a two and a half movie boasting three villains, two romances, numerous fight sequences and lots of crying its quite an achievement. In fact the movie seems to be lacking a lot of things. It never seems ambitious, in fact at times it feels like its running in circles rather than movie the story forward. And the only time the story seems to movie forward it eventually goes backwards yet again. I suppose where the movies goes wrong is the fact is decides to introduce three villains, all three interesting enough, but then the director has decided to use them barely at all and just make them add to an already over packed movie. I will give the movie its due, it isn't bad. In fact had this not have been the big summer opening this might have scored a 7/10. However despite its cool action sequences, half decent performances and a final hour that does really work, it never feels as good as it could have been. Spiderman 1 was flawed but was still a well though out movie, Spiderman 2 was absolutely spectacular, but Spiderman 3 is a jumbled mess with moments of brilliance. In terms of sequels this seems to go firmly alongside X3, too much goes on in both of those movies.Well lets first talk about the performances. First has to be Tobey Maguire as I am about to say something I never thought possible. I have finally excepted him as Spiderman. In the past two movies I found him annoying, here, despite when he decides to go emo on us (excruciatingly awful scenes there), he does a brilliant job. He seems to be well thought out here, his character conveying vast ranges of emotions. My only problem with him were in the ""evil-Spidey"" sequences, that were very bad in my eyes. Kirsten Dunst here seems sidelined, well not her character, but her performance. She has little to work with here, she seems more prop placement than a character in her own right. Topher Grace is pretty good as Venom and his alter-ego, but his character has far too little screen time so we never really get to see his purpose in the movie. As I've said many times Venom deserves a movie all to himself, not ten minutes of screen time! Sandman, played by Thomas Haden Church perhaps frustrated me the most. Church is a superb actor, yet here he seems pointless. Sandman as a character is never explored, an unnecessary sub-plot about his daughter just adds layers to a story that is way too over packed. My view is that either Sandman or Venom had to be dropped for this movie to ever reach its full potential. Now James Franco does well, he's easily the best thing in the movie. His character is the most complicated and remains the most interesting. Gwen Stacey on the other hand, well lets not even go there. A waste of an opportunity if you ask me.The action sequences of Spiderman 3 I suppose are its highlights, a shame there are huge gaps between the fights, and not a single one comes even slightly close to the greatness of the train scrap between Doc Ock and Spiderman in the first sequel. The fights here looks amazing, the CGI is very impressive, especially the stuff with Venom and Sandman. And the final fight sequence is something behold. Yet all the fights get a bit repetitive after a while, the stuff with Sandman is instantly forgettable. In fact its only the Goblin and Spiderman sequences that really stick firmly in memory, they're brilliantly edited and they have a power the other fight sequences really seem to lack. As I've said there's not too much action, the movie is padded out to 2 and half hours with annoying romance sequences and lots of crying. The romance goes nowhere once again and seems to be doing another lap of what we've seen before. It now just seems boring and I wish Raimi would get a backbone and give them something daring to deal with.Overall Spiderman 3 comes out as passable entertainment. But for a movie hyped up to be the best film of the year it just manages to scrape above average. A plodding run time, too much going on and lots of other faults make it a forgettable experience. The action sequences and good performances make the movie do well, and if you're a Spiderman fan you're still likely to enjoy the movie. But don't expect anything amazing, as Spiderman 3 is anything but.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

That is nothing new really, most horrible movies don't put any clips of scenes that are not good in trailers. Really movie editors should do a trailer first and if they like that edit the movie to that feel, and leave all the campy over the top crap on the cutting room floor.The story was pretty weak but it had a lot of characters that felt flat because there was no time to develop them into anything worth while. For me that wasn't really the issue, I could have lived with a weak story as long as it was believable enough, and the movie had the action to fill up our entertainment cup. Luckily after reading reviews and getting a phone call from a friend letting me know that he walked out half way through, I let down my hype and was ready to get disappointed. And while watching the movie, there were little ""humorous"" scenes in and around that could be easily looked past, but then Peter got Emo... er taken over by the symbiot, and made a real fool out of himself. I really understand where the script was trying to go with this, but it was executed so badly. It would have worked for sure in a comic book or even as a cartoon, but live action? Do people not look at these scenes after they're shot and see what a mess it is? Not sure if it's the actor's fault (Toby just can't pull of some things, like not looking so stupid when he's crying) or the Director's. Ether way there is no excuse for that.So that is what basically ruined the movie for me, taking that whole section out and if you haven't seen the movie you will know what it is when/if you see it, would make for a better film. Still weak, but at least not a 5 out of 10, at least a 7.My suggestion to people seeing it for the first time, as soon as you see Emo-Peter walking on the street like a Greaser. Get up of your seat, go get a refill on your 2 liter cup of soda, take you're time in the washroom, make conversation with the staff and come back in about 10-15 minutes. It's definitely a better use of your time.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

First of all, tackling three major villains in one movie is a lot, but somehow the movie keeps it all under control. Second, some of the humor is the best in the series. Third, great action scenes (although arguably no better than Spider-Man 2's). Fourth (and this seems to be my unique opinion), I think the acting (as a whole) is the best in this movie.But, there are a few things I just can't ignore. One, WHY did they have to try to do so much in one movie? While they definitely pull it off, Venom, Green Goblin, and even Sandman could carry an entire movie alone. There's definitely a lack of a ""main"" villain in this movie. It actually hurts a little to see Venom treated as a tacked-on villain.Two, how do I describe it...a lack of satiety. For a 2 and a half hour movie, I still felt that there were some pieces missing. The movie was entertaining, but is THIS going to be the last one in the series? If so, all I can say is I'm not satisfied...I want more. Pardon me for sounding pretentious, but I feel like spider-man has not completed the emotional journey he starts in this movie. It's like the movie built up to a climax that doesn't quite happen.Still, taken on its own the movie is definitely worth watching, entertaining, and funny. If nothing else, this movie does two things very well: Spider-Man's decent into darkness, and sympathizing for the Sandman.7/10","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

For me, this film represents the worst of the trilogy.The main problem in this film is its script. It has many threads, but never develops any of them strongly, so that the film becomes muddled and tedious. Rather than focusing on a jumbled array of side plots and three villains, this film should have focused on developing some side plots and one or maybe two of its villains instead. As it was, the plot developments that were put forth were mostly lax. The development of the ""dark Peter Parker"" subplot was actually laughable as Peter suddenly decided on a more conspicuous and blackened hair style and makeup. Even the film's final conflict wasn't particularly exciting.Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst's roles in this film aren't on par with what they had to work with in previous films. James Franco is proficient as Harry and did have some notable scenes. Thomas Haden Church is effective as Flint Marko, but the character was very underdeveloped by the script. Invariably the best performance of the film was from J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. Topher Grace's character was developed as a trite ""office rival"" and was unnecessary. However, Bruce Campbell's cameo as the Maître d' was amusing. Overall, though, ""Spider-Man 3"" was a disappointing entry into the superhero genre.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The first two installments in the franchise helped rejuvenate the comic book movie, making them be taken seriously and showing that a little imagination surrounded by the real world could create suspense, action, and heart. Spider-Man 3 had a lot of expectations to live up to, and not just to be cohesive and complete with three villains and a couple new faces on the side. I know I myself went into the film to see whether Sam Raimi and company could round the story out and keep true to what had come before. By the end, while not completely satisfied and somewhat letdown at times, I found that I could still come out with a smile. The arcs of our principal characters come to a close and the presentation is a sight to behold. Unfortunately, with all the spectacle, money, and talent going into it, I just wished it would have stayed truer in tone and brought a little more to the table.First off, the acting is fantastic as usual; if nothing else, the trio of films showed that comic book films didn't need to be campy. Tobey Maguire proves again why he was, and is, the only choice to play the titular role. If Sony backs up their statements that a fourth go is in store with or without him, I may join the masses in boycotting it and taking a stand for artistic credibility rather than financial gain. Even when Maguire needed to ham it up (more on this later), he is the perfect mixture of geek and cool to pull it off perfectly. Kirsten Dunst does well again, showing some emotion in what is more simply a damsel-in-distress role than the previous films and James Franco is good also. Franco needs to show some huge range going from villain to amnesiac happy-go-lucky kid, and while he goes a tad overboard on the giddiness, the part works. As for the newcomers, Raimi shows once again that he has some clout and Hollywood cred, assembling one of the biggest casts with people doing very little. Bryce Dallas Howard is little more than a pawn at the expense of the plot and James Cromwell is a blink and you'll miss him blip on the screen. Even our new villains are given much less screen time than anticipated, however, they step it up and really steal the show.Thomas Haden Church truly inhabits the inner conflicted soul of Sandman. Everything he does is for love and while he may not want to do some things, he has no problem doing them if it may bring him closer to his daughter. Church gives a layered and nuanced performance, never falling into the one-dimensional villain trap a character like this usually does. As for the long awaited arrival of Venom, Topher Grace shows why he deserves the big budget roles to go along with his more accomplished indie porfolio. The malice and manic hysteria that comes out of him is both fun and frightening and he becomes an enjoyable foe to our hero. Along with the superb acting, we are given some spectacular visual effects. While some set pieces and background animation at many times looks cartoony and unpolished, you cannot fault the sandwork or the alien symbiote creature. The amount of detail taken on these two villains definitely shows where the enormous budget went, and it is good to see it was used to great effect.Where the film ultimately falls apart, in my opinion, is with the story itself. This is the first of the trilogy not to have a comic book mythology veteran behind the script. With most coming from Raimi himself and his brother, it shows a bit of a lack of stakes that the previous two had. Instead we are given a complete tonal change and a ton of slapstick and comedic moments. Some sequences, like that of Maguire dancing through the streets, confidence oozing from him due to the symbiote, really slow the film down to a crawl. The movie tries at too many times to be cute and while this might work to offset the dark and suspenseful moments in other films, Spider-Man 3 doesn't really have many rough spots to counteract. Sure the fight scenes are spectacular, but they just lack the sense of urgency from the past installments, always keeping the viewer removed from what is happening, just waiting for the heroes to be victorious. What started as a dark tale of heroism and the battle of one's own demons, with the first two chapters, concludes in a very heavy-handed and sentimental way.By no means am I not recommending this film thoughI enjoyed it throughout and only in a few instances did I feel its length. It is just that with the second part upping the ante like it did from its already great predecessor, I was disappointed that this final chapter ended up being the least successful of the three. Maybe it was because so much was happening and it all had to be resolved in one film, maybe it was that this is possibly the last Spider-Man from Raimi and he needed to end it all on his terms, I don't know. What I do know, though, is that the writing is not as intelligent as it was and sappiness, along with unintentional laughs, sometimes made me cringe. However, when the fighting started and emotions ran high, you can't not be caught up in it allat least until the dust settles.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Toby and Kirsten are by far the worst actors in a long time to get such a huge series of rolls. I truly don't understand how this is considered good? Doesn't anyone remember the Crow? How great that movie was? How great some comic book movies can be? These studios continue to release senseless drivel and people keep paying to see it. These movies just get worse and worse every time. Luckily the 300 came out this year and sort of redeemed the comic/graphic novel world of films. But it's not enough. The viewer has to demand more at some point or its just all a waste of time. The reality is, there are some studio execs out there making decisions about creativity and style of which, they have none. Junk in is junk out.

This film is without a doubt the best film of the trilogy, as well as the best film of the year. Many fans will complain about the climax, and its deviation from the comics, but I enjoyed every minute of this movie and I could care less about any deviation from the comics. Raimi has fun with this film and treats it as his masterpiece of the three. That being said, I'm not sure they're going to do a fourth one. The great thing is, there are loose ends that are subtly left untied, unlike X3. There could very well be a fourth one, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if Lizard was one of the villains, since Dr. Connors has been in the last two films. There were two things that impressed me most about this film. One was that they could tie all the plot lines together cohesively, as well as have enough room for sufficient character development. The second was the acting. James Franco, as well as Topher Grace embrace their villainy. Thomas Hayden Church is great as the tragic Sandman. Kirsten Dunst is beautiful from the opening scene. Tobey Maguire proves he can act. He's absolutely off the wall. I enjoyed this so much that I wanna go again tomorrow night!

There are many examples of this. Alien 3, Lethal Weapon 3, even Return of the Jedi is for me the weakest film in the 1st Star Wars trilogy. Spider-Man 3 is no exception. It is in no way a complete failure, but is the weakest of the Spider-Man films. It has been reported that it is the most expensive film of all time, and there lies the problem. I think that Sam Raimi and company had so much money and pressure to deliver a home run on this film that they packed the movie with way to much stuff. There are three villains this time, Sandman, Venom, and The Green Goblin. That is one too many, the movie lacks the focus of the first two. It's all over the place. There is the inner conflicts that Peter Parker deals with, his relationship with Mary Jane, it all was dealt with much better in the other 2 films. The disadvantage with here is that the audience is already so familiar with these characters that there isn't anything really new, so the conflicts between them are not as compelling.Yes, the FX are impressive, but they are nothing that we haven't seen before. The action is well done, but without the strong story it just doesn't involve me more because the CGI cost so much. Sam Raimi balanced all the elements of a big budget summer movie to near perfection in Spider-man 2, the FX and action were there, but the story is what made it a great movie. Here he was given as many toys as he wanted and it almost got completely away from him.It is entertaining, but I heard almost every person that was walking out the theater say that Spider-Man 2 was much better.Grade: B-","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I have never really liked the casting of Toby Maguire in the first place, but the casting choices in this third installment were atrocious all around. Bryce Howard as a romantic rival to Kirsten Dunst seemed an incredibly ridiculous notion, not because she doesn't have the looks, but Kirsten Dunst is what you'd call a teen female ""heartthrob"" and Bryce Howard isn't. She looks so out of place it's distracting. Topher Grace as Venom is ridiculous. Period. I've liked him in other things but it was almost like he was trying to be worse than he had to be. I realize Sam Raimi makes horribly cheesy films but Topher wasn't even good cheesy. Just ridiculous cheesy. It's possible that Thomas Hayden Church, while not really suited to be a super-villain, did the best acting and character work in the entire show. I was disappointed with just about everything else in the movie with the exception of J.K. Simmons who has been consistently dynamite since the first installation. Pretty depressing turn of events for Spider-man fans if you ask me.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The special effects team did a great job especially with the final action sequence although I thought some of the venom sequences were a little poor, such as when venom was talking the mouth movements looked quite bad and Eddie Brock's teeth changing to fangs permanently looked pretty stupid. Kirsten Dunst looked great, I thought she looked awful in Spiderman 2. Great to see the return of certain characters such as J Jameson, the Russian landlord, his daughter and the thug from number 1, not to mention Harry Osbourne who gave the best performance in the movie, he really gives a good show of conflicting emotions. The negatives are based primarily on a lot of cheesy acting. I know they were trying to show extremes between good and evil but dancing stupidly down the street? terrible child actors proclaiming ""wicked, cool!"",the annoying news reporter on scene for the final showdown, not to mention that Spider-man's heroic entry at the final battle shows the American flag flying behind him, disgusted flashback to Super-man (1978) anyone? The film never really explores Sandman's story properly, we learn his daughter is dying but not why, we learn Flint was trying to get money to pay for treatment but not what kind of treatment. He says he's not a bad guy but a guy who had bad luck, we know Flint killed Uncle Ben and his ""justifying story"" really has no justification and we're supposed to have sympathy for this guy? Besides all this information we know from the previews and trailers, no more information is given in the movie which is kinda annoying. The origin of Venom isn't explored properly, Harry Osbourne isn't really given enough screen time to give his character justice, consider that they've been teasing it for two movies and he gets half a dozen short scenes to wrap it all up!, all in all, having three opponents for spidey is all well and good if you can explore them properly, this is never really done but they did make for some great action sequences. I would also say it's a very soppy movie in that it features A lot of singing, dancing and extravagant dresses, it was mostly a chick flick with undertones of comic action. All in all, a chick flick crossed with an action movie. If you're a fan of the comics then this won't satisfy you as it doesn't explore the characters properly, although it is cool to see such infamous villains brought to life. If you're an action movie fan the action scenes are great but you will probably get bored by the chick flick scenes and vice versa, chick flick fans might get bored of the action scenes, but these tend to be over reasonably fast. I loved Spider-man and I liked Spider-man 2 a lot but I was so disappointed by Spider-man 3 that I have had to write my views immediately. Franco rocked as Harry and Simmons was great as Jonah, apart from that I cringed in my seat as opposed to sitting on the edge with excitement, wait for the rental, cheaper and you can pause it occasionally to recover from the awful cheesy moments for which Sam Raimi can not be forgiven. I looked forward to this for a long time, I am very, very disappointed.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Spiderman 3 I felt didn't live up to its prior titles or roles. the characters are an interesting pick for villains but the development just wasn't fully there. It seemed as if the developers and screen writers tried to fit way to much into a 2.5 hour movie.Topher Grace wasn't the best pick of the role of Eddie Brock. In my past experience in comic books Eddie Brock has always been this big tall body building guy that was strong in stature, Topher Grace didn't meet any of those requirements. Sitting there watching him you didn't know if this guy really is supposed to be Venom or some annoying Jimmy the photographer.Despite the fact it did have a very strong opener, making it the leading movie opening of all times, one could predict this movie won't do as well as the first titles did. Special effects were very strong, The Sandman which everybody thought would have been weak was a very well done character.From reading other posts you can pretty much make the same judgement, your either A. going to see spiderman with the expectations of this movie being as well as the first 2 or B.

Spidey-3 delivers all that you could dream in 2 hours and 20 mins. You want action, than you got it!!! Spidey-3 without a doubt has the best special effects to date... some of the most intense fight scenes your going to ever see... the fight scenes alone are worth the price of admission. The scenes with the crane going out of control... I dare someone say that was not the best action scene EVER created!!! And the most realistic looking one...I understand people being mad at all of the plots... but you got to realize while in production... they thought it was the last one... so they wanted to wrap everything up! And when Peters Parker is ""BAD"" I mean, come on... he's already a geek... so you should expect him to be a geeky bad guy... I love the way he is betrayed, fits his character.I agree certain things should of ended differently... but o well... at least it didn't screw everything up like Superman Returns did... Spidey-3 is very loyal to the comic...And last thing... Spider-Man without Tobey will suck major balls... He might not be the idea Spider-Man... but he's the BEST fit for Peter Parker... and that's what separates Spider-Man from the rest of the Super Hero movies... cause Spider-Man, despite the name... is about Peter Parker... Superman is about super-man, Batman about Batman... and so fourth. You connect with Peter Parker... not Spider-Man. Other movie you connect with the Super Hero.

"","","Visually stunning, stylized, underrated superhero movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2483829/?ref_=tt_urv","maximvit","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25592259/?ref_=tt_urv","4 September 2011","There is probably going to be lots of disagreement here, but I think this is the best Spider-Man movie out of Sam Raimi's trilogy.Spider-Man 3 picks off where Spider-man 2 ended: with Peter Parker and MJ dating, growth of popularity as Spiderman, but of course, there are some problems. A strange black sludge starts to posses Spiderman, a new villain named Sandman appears and Peter's best friend, Harry gets the Green Goblin's gadgets and becomes the New Goblin in order to avenge his father.This is probably something where we will agree: visually, it is the best. The stunning birth of Sandman, the intense mid-air fight between Spiderman and the New Goblin, the creepy black sludge and the spectacular ending fight scene are all amazing and would have deserved an Visual-effects Oscar more then Spiderman 2.But not just in technicals, I think this movie is better then Spiderman and Spiderman 2. The storyline is well great, even tough there are basically three villains, it is still well put together to go with the relationship between MJ and Peter and the murder of Peter's uncle. The actors all do just as good, (and that is very good) job like in the first two movies and this is probably the funniest movie out of the three as well.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

A love triangle, a family drama, a dark alter-ego story and not one, not two, but THREE major villains. And all that in just over two hours.Does it work? Well, yes and no. More no then yes, actually.For me the whole movie seems rushed. Everything happens as quickly as possible to make room for some more things to happen. Relationships between characters change and re-change every five minutes, good guys go bad, bad guys go good... it's basically all a big mess. The action scenes are good, but I must say that by this time I am a bit dumbed down to spectacular CGI action sequences. Gone are the days when one minute of T-Rex roaring into camera made my day - now I want a good story to go with my jumping, exploding, punching and swinging stuff.Peter Parker got it worst this time around. One minute he's happy, then depressed, then a bit too full of himself, angry, then cocky, then back to sad again... it's all bit irritating, really. Mary Jane is stripped down to a clichéd ""girlfriend who feels neglected"" character. The Green goblin story basically repeats itself. Sandman is neither here or there - this guy needs psychoteraphy, not superhero clashes. (Note to Sandman: make up your mind already!) And Venom is just tacked on - the black suit story should really have carried on to the next installment instead of getting a ham-fisted treatment.Is the movie bad? Well, not entirely, you still get your proverbially entertaining Spidey action sequences, and some of the effects are really good. But it all seems.. lacking somehow. One of the true reasons Spiderman was so well accepted as a character was his human side, but the characters in this movie are not human in any aspect, and I'm not really talking about their superhero mutations. They are victims of a relentless plot, which throws them, twists them and turns and leaves them gasping for air. It's hard to sympathize with protagonists who aren't really sure themselves if they are heroes, villains or just plain confused.And that's it. Just my 2 cents.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The plot is not as deep as spider-man 2, in which- among other things- spider-man had to deal with his inner conflicts between his love and his responsibilities. Such a plot depth is replaced in spider-man 3 with more characters and more villains, which leads us to the point of the movie not having enough character development. Too many characters+ too many villains lead to that you don't get to see enough of each villain, for me that was the case with venom and sandman, i really wanted to see more of these two with more fight scenes with spider-man.The special effects are very good, and the acting is excellent.Overall it is an entertaining and enjoyable movie.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Even since I was a young boy about twenty years ago, I've always kept in touch with Spiderman and its various comic adaptations. More or less its had its own variations but some things remained the same, and in my honest opinion, gave our hero its unique taste as compared to other super beings. Making Spiderman more 'mortal', more 'human' in comparison to other famous heroes like Superman and Batman. Villains, were always very important to Spidey's life. Most importantly, Harry's GG and Venom were always his arch-rivals in the comics. Both due to power clashing, but also due to psychological reasons. The reason for this small intro, is to better explain to me why this movie would be fan to watch as a 'standalone' adaptation, had we not seen the previous two spideys. I think it suffered from the same thing X3 suffered. Too much to tell, too little time, too propagandistic at times that does not befit a hero like spidey (too many messages, too many notations, too much patriotism). Worse of all, it took Spiderman life's most important characters, like MJ, Harry, and Venom and minored them to sidekick level. the movie builds, and builds, and builds up quite efficiently but then it runs out of time. And hurriedly throws everything together. Not explaining a thing about venom neutralizing spider's sense. Not a thing about the depth of Harry's confused state for Peter (never in my knowledge did such an ending come on Harry. Instead, the two always mind-twisted one another using each one's past traumatic experiences)Spidey's adaptation of his darker self was a bliss though, and Jona was amazing as always. Pity they didn't' give him more time.Overall, a 6/10. Too cliché, and too shallow at certain points, but still a spiderman. And at certain moments, performances save the day.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Maybe this is why it was such a disappointment when the movie was terrible. The plot of the movie is that Spiderman is know liked by most of the city because of his triumph over Doc Ock in the last film. In this new film, there are 3, basically four new villains. They are the sandman, the new goblin, venom, and the black-suited Spiderman himself. The sandman escapes from jail and is now lose in the city trying to steal money to help his sick daughter or something like that. Peter learns that the true murderer of his uncle Ben was the sandman. The new goblin (Harry Osbourne) now knows the true identity of Spiderman and seeks revenge on him for his fathers death. A meteor or something falls from the sky and in it is a black goo that takes over Peter Parkers' body while he is wearing the suit, which turns his suit black and turns his personality evil i guess. During all of this going on, Peter also struggles to maintain his relationship with Mary Jane and deal with a new photographer (Topher Grace) at work. Eventually the black goo leaves Spiderman and goes onto Eddie Brock (Grace)turn him into venom. I know it sounds like a lot to handle and that is the major reason why this movie turned out so bad.Bad because:There were too many things going on throughout the movie that it was like trying to followed 5 or 6 different stories all at one time. The movie focused too much of the relationship between Mary Jane and Peter that the was not much of Spiderman The ending was just plain retarded. Harry should not have died. Venom was only in the movie at the end for like 15 minutes when the whole movie should have just focused on his character and not the other villains. The main villain in my opinion was the sandman which i thought was the most boring character. Bryce Dallas Howards' role as Gwen Stacy was definitely not needed in the movie -the voice of venom sounded like a little girl. Spiderman jumping in front of an American flag. Characters that were in the movie at the beginning were not there again until the end. The sandman being able to fly through the air as a bunch of sand was corny. It was way too easy for Spiderman to defeat venom, all he had to do was make a loud noise. Tobey Mcquire dancingGood Because- The acting of James Franco, Topher Grace, Rosemary Harris, J.K. Simmons, and Bruce Campbell The alley scence of Spiderman and the new goblin. Venom looked cool. Funny. Its a movie about Spiderman.I would recommend seeing this movie once just so you can see really how bad it is compared to the first 2.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The third movie did not live up to the promise and hype. Waited way too long for the symbiont to latch onto Peter and then not enough of Peter as the black Spiderman. The fight scenes were good (what little there were). Bottom line is too much romance and not enough action. Let's face facts, Spiderman is an action superhero not a soap opera star. The first two movies kept me on the edge of my seat, but I actually found myself starting to nod off a few times in this movie. Especially during the tragic dance scene in the bar. In the comic book the symbiont would ""cloth"" Peter when he needed to turn into Spiderman. It is then that the symbiont started taking over Peter's mind, not when he was walking around as Peter Parker. I am surprised Stan Lee didn't step up during the filming and say STOP!, this is all wrong!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I usually give movies a big benefit of the doubt just for the fact it takes a lot of work, time, effort and cost to make a movie....But it also takes a lot of work to make ME not like a movie, and this one did a pretty good job at that. The 'dramatic' emotional scenes were terrible. I mean, the acting was so terribly poor at certain scenes that it actually seemed like they tried it in one take. OR that the CONSTANT scenes with attempts at being humorous made the actors too laid-back to pull off a serious scene.We also have FAR too many convenience issues in the film. I can understand one or two, it's a movie after all, but this one had one too many.If you are a Spidey fan, odds are this film will leave you asking 'Why?' and telling yourself that if a sequel doesn't happen, JUST so they can take a shot at redeeming themselves, you are going to be upset with the so-called 'wrap up' to this trilogy.If you haven't seen it, it's still definitely worth seeing it...

Granted, a lot of people do not share this opinion, but then we all have differing tastes do we not. For me I was extremely surprised at how well the movie was made and how the story progressed...from all the reviews I was expecting a bit of a jumbled mess instead of a story that may had a lot of plot points, but for me they all came together quite nicely in the end. There is quite a lot of drama in this one, I will not deny that either as this was the complaint of a couple of people I know. I say a movie needs heart to keep your emotions going, and it was not like there was no action in this one, this one had more action than the previous two installments. When I read about this movie from critics and such I was not expecting what I got, I had a rather negative review ready to go on how this movie should have only been the black suit without Venom and how he should be introduced in the next movie, in the end Venom was not quite in the movie as much as I would have liked, but I still enjoyed the scenes he was in as Topher Grace was surprisingly effective as the character. And speaking of effective Thomas Haden Church was also excellent as the hulking yet sad Sandman. The plot, everything is going alright with Spidey at the beginning, the city of New York has embraced Peter Parker's alter ego, this however kind of blinds Peter from the fact MJ's career is not going quite so good and he does a few things that he should not. If this were not enough Harry attacks him as the New Goblin and another super villain appears as the Sandman, a powerful foe seemingly unstoppable. Add to this the fact that Flint Marko, aka the Sandman, may have actually been the one to kill his uncle and the pressure is really on Parker as now the old stirrings of revenge have surfaced. Fortunately, thanks to an accident Harry seems to be his old self again, not so fortunate some sort of alien material has now attached itself to Spider man and now Spidey and Peter are exhibiting a darker edge. So that is how it plays out, throw in an annoying new photographer named Eddie Brock causing Peter and Spidey headaches and you have a wild ride as there are fights in the skies of New York, on the streets, in the subways, and finally the biggest fight in any of the Spidey movies at a building under construction, an all out battle with two villains and even two heroes. However, this movie will not be for everyone as there are stretches where the movie is really dramatic between the action scenes, and even though I loved it, it still left me depressed too. Still if it ends on this it will be okay, however I do believe there is an opening for a sequel and if there is one I do believe the focus will be on that one particular character that some complain was not in this one enough. Though one thing was kind of lame, was Peter walking through the streets doing his little shuffle, I do think they could have come up with a better way to portray his dark side than that as I would have at least included a scene of him in the black suit taking out some criminals with a bit more force than necessary.","52 out of 101 found this helpful.

This is hands down one of the biggest disappointments. I came in with the highest of expectations and it managed to fall so short of these that I actually am amazed. The movie seemed hastily thrown together, with more characters than they knew what to do with. They would introduce one, then through terribly written plot, they would place them on the back burner while they introduced another superfluous character. I could not believe that this was the same director as the first two. Aside from the horrendous character selection they also managed to make the movie as corny as they possibly could. (Spoiler Alert) Franco and Maguire must have cried about seven to eight times between them. SPOILER ALERT: here is the number one reason why it was terrible: Venom is in it for 15 minutes and mostly sports the head of TV's Eric Foreman (Topher Grace). They managed to make one of the most bad ass villains in comic history the biggest pu$$y of all. It seemed as if they threw venom in last minute and decided to just film him getting his a$$ kicked most of the time.All in all I beg you not to see this movie in theaters, I can not believe what a waste of time and money it is. Just wait for the DVD at least then you can be disappointed in the comfort of your own home.","36 out of 81 found this helpful.

I can't remember the last time I was so enthralled by a film and for nearly 3 hours and 45 Mons, that isn't bad going.I thought the first two were great but this Spider-man 3 has it all; action, character, drama, romance, humour and a lot of violence. Just the way I like my comic book movies.Sam Raimi did a great job but I really do hope that this is the last so that the team and the franchise can finish on a high. I don't think they have anywhere else to go in terms of quality, other than down. (definitely if Sam will no longer be directing and the cast is different - Tobey Maguire will be in his late 30's, and still at high school?!) I'm going to go and see it again as soon as I get a chance. I recommend you go see it. Especially if they do a fourth, and even more especially if they give the directors job to that idiot Mark Steven Johnson.","31 out of 57 found this helpful.

Spiderman3 wil go down as one of the all time best movies. If ou can see it at the IMAX then so much the better. The Plot: Peter Parker (Maguire), a.k.a. Spider-Man, faces a series of new challenges and threats as he embraces public adulation for the first time. His new-found self confidence causes him to take his relationships for granted -- namely his union with M.J. (Dunst), which is tested by the presence of the doting Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard). Self-assuredness also comes into play as he faces not one, but two powerful villains: Sandman (Church), an escaped convict made powerful by a nuclear explosion, and Venom (Grace), a parasitic life form from our hero's past. User Rating: THE BUZZ: Production on S-M 3 started quietly (and much less dramatically than its predecessor) in November, 2005. There were no chubby Tobey stories in the trades, no rumors of Jake Gyl replacing him ... just reports that our hero will face down not one, but two of his fiercest opponents. The formula rebooted the Batman franchise, and it's all but a guarantee to help make the third film in the series the most successful yet. Poor Topher Grace is facing the same fanboy scrutiny that Maguire himself weathered back when he was originally cast. In our minds, the actors are wonderfully paired. Though what's with the emphasis on the blondish boys and the minimal appearances of Mary Jane and new rival Gwen?","30 out of 55 found this helpful.

The storyline is very weak , when i first saw the posters of the movie i thought that it was about that black material that came from the sky to fall just next to spider-man !!! i also thought that it gonna be sad or dramatic or something like that , when u see the movie u feel that they tried to make a combination of stories that are not connected to each other so the movie appeared very far away from being a one unit . these are my notes :1) that black material why it fall exactly next to spider-man ? and why it waited until half the movie to move and attack him although it was under his bed all the time ?!!!!2) Harry isn't a bad guy , he just wanted to revenge for his father death , he loved M.J , then you find him suddenly attacks her just to break spider's heart ?!! and that stupid old man in harry's apartment waited until the end of the movie to tell harry that his father killed himself !! then harry suddenly turned into a good guy again to help spider ?!!!!!3) the Sandman was a bad guy or a good guy !? well we will never know , after stealing banks and destroying buildings spider forgave him and let him go !! yes u are a good guy , go steal some banks to help Ur sick daughter !! then why didn't he ask spider-man for help from the beginning ?4) the worst part of the movie was when that black thing controlled spider-man , it was supposed to turn him into an evil spider , but he kept saving people , and instead of stealing banks or attacking cops , he just walked around the road dancing and looking at girls !!5) the strangest thing in this movie was that camera man , faking pictures doesn't mean that he is a monster !! but after that black material controlled him he became more than a monster !! the thing that me laugh is why he jumped at the bomb when spider-man was killing the black material ? the answer is simple someone must die at the end of the movie !! , by the way every movie based on a comic book for some reason must end with the kidnapping of the girl and the super-hero tries to save her !!6) i didn't know that there are celebrations for super-heroes where they come and show in front of the crowds !! i thought that they come and help people then disappear !! finally , spider man 3 could have been done very better than this , the movie is too long that i'll never see it again , i'm a spider-man fan , but i'm very disappointed , i think we shall wait for the 4th part hopping that it gonna be better !!!!!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

A dreadful script mixed with radical changes of pace (it's an action film! No, it's a screwball comedy! Now it's a darkly psychological drama! No, now it's a song-and-dance extravaganza!), combined with Tobey Maguire, Kristen Dunst and Topher Grace all competing to out-suck one another all adds up to a film that is both poorly executed and - bizarrely, given the subject matter - deathly dull. Not even the special effects are that glittering. JK Simmons, Ted Raimi and Bruce Campbell make it almost worth watching bits of, but a better evening's entertainment could be had slamming one's genitals in a car door. The dialogue would certainly be better.","25 out of 54 found this helpful.

I thought the character development in the first two films were brilliant and enjoyed the second movie over the first one.My thoughts on the third film was that this tried too hard to be so many different kinds of films. I will try not to put any spoilers into it. The film was formulaic and was full of many predictable plot points and chock full of hokey clichés. This like the Schumacher Batman sequels tried to implement too many character onto screen and could have been trimmed significantly. The visual effects were brilliant, and the acting was on par with the rest of the series, it just didn't hold the same emotional impact on me as the other did. There were also some plot holes. Perhaps I will enjoy it more on a second viewing when it comes to DVD. As of now the hype and expectations from the previous films have cast too big a shadow on this film for me. Spider-Man 3 isn't necessarily a bad movie, it just wasn't what I thought it would be. The plot could have been made into two movies if this was re-cut it could have helped it by making it Spider-Man 3 and Spider-Man 4. It was just too much for one movie. 6 out of 10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It is epic, sprawling, magnificent, meaningful, beautiful. Anyone who doesn't enjoy this movie must be a pretty spoilt brat or a cynical old misery. For near on three hours it envelops you in its world and makes you CARE about the characters. How's that for a special effects laden blockbuster, a movie with characters that matter? The comedy works, the emotion works, the action works. Everything Raimi tries comes off. The set pieces are particularly astounding, ranging from an out of control crane to Spidey's numerous battles with the meaty villains on show. Like others, I think this is by far the best of the three (though I loved the first two as well). It's a modern-day classic, an enrapturing fantasy that exhibits all that's best in modern movie making. An experience not to be missed.","126 out of 266 found this helpful.

Spider-Man 2 is said to be the best superhero movie ever made, and topping it is nearly impossible. For the third film, Raimi tried to make a bigger movie instead of a better one. He succeeded. Spider-Man 3 has more of everything. More villains, more love story, more fight scenes. It's bigger, but it's not necessarily better.One of Spiderman's biggest flaws is too much in too little of time. Too many villains and too many characters seemed to drag the film down a bit. But no matter, Raimi seems to catch your attention, right before you drown into all the nonsense, with his breathtaking action sequences. Unfortunately, there was simply not enough time to make a flawless movie with all the characters, villains and plots they throw at you in spider-man 3. However, you will be entertained. I guarantee you that; with the genius action sequences and the comedy, it seems to me that spider-man 3 just has a double dose of everything, some good, and some bad. Luckily unlike those other failed third superhero movies, Spider-Man 3 is the first of its kind to keep the same cast and crew together through three films. That's enough to keep it swinging. Still there's no denying that trying to squeeze so many different villains into a single movie hurts it. Yes, there were some cheesy parts of the movie, but what is a superhero movie without them! It's a comic book movie for goodness sakes! Howevever, if you go into the movie, leaving behind your realistic thinking; hence black goo coming from outer space with no explanation on how, you'll be able to sit back and enjoy one of the most entertaining superhero movies around.","36 out of 68 found this helpful.

Fulfilling it's obligatory requirements in spades, Spider-Man 3 continues to provide enough action, romance, drama, and comedy to justify another family outing. This time around though, mostly in place of a steady narrative lies the littered extracts of multiple threads tied together. In place of one encompassing conflict, the compacted screenplay attempts to mold no less then three of Spider-Man's enemies into this action extravaganza. For better or worse this will make or break the film for fans. Different concentration on Spidey's multiple adversaries lends well to keeping a diverse set of cutting edge fight sequences on hand, probably outshining any of the visceral memories from the last two films. But in fragmenting his attention amongst the different villains, Raimi (who this time was actually involved in writing the script) never really brings a worthwhile conflict to the fore, instead indulging crowds with an assortment of spectacular though mostly insignificant brawls. The technology behind capturing these heated battles has obviously never been better, as always there are plenty of moments that beg to be witnessed on a theater screen, but the overall impression is a bunch of fabulous, adrenaline pumping scenes that do not add up to cohesive whole.Still, it may be for that very indulgence that the film is as successful as it will most likely be. Whereas in the past I felt perhaps too much time was spent on completely clichéd wisdom, taking Parker's struggles to an unnecessary pulpit of sorts, this time around the heavy-handed dialog seemed toned down a bit, more in touch with web-slinging roots that dominate the visuals. Yes, there is another trial Parker must face within himself as he continues to identify the real person he thinks he is, but this time psychological undertones do not drown out Spider-Man's intended purpose, which would be to dazzle.And dazzle it does, cutting through much of the generic repetition with some of the finest CGI technical work to date. Exemplifying the quality design this team has become known for, right from the start it is apparent the action will definitely be trying to one-up some tough predecessors. From the film's first breakneck action sequence, Raimi shows his phenomenal talent for directing at high speeds, and puts forth some truly exciting chases. Along with Maguire's newfound pleasure in taking this little walk to the dark side, lies the heart and soul of another box office smash. Raimi is just able to ink out another worthwhile story from these mostly reused elements between spectacular confrontations, fittingly ending this trilogy on an appropriate, if obvious note. One does wonder what he will have left to say, if rumors hold true and Spider-Man is given a second trio of films; most characters just feel used up from this point out.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Many uppity Film-Critics and jaded Fanboys have Weighed in on the Weight of the Thing, but that's the Thing. This End to the Trilogy is a Darkly Heavy Conclusion and it is a Spectacular Spider-Man to say the Least.Director Sam Raimi and the State of the Art SFX Team, and the Returning Cast are in Full Throttle for this Last Entry in Their Series. It's like in the Early Years of its Silver Age Comics when the Monthly Titles were 12 cents and then there was that anticipated OverSized Annual, Costing a Whopping 25 cents. Excelsior!This is Oversized and it Cost More to make. While that can Signal Trouble, Not So for this Power-Packed Picture. It is Edgier too. A Tale from a Director who Knows Dark and Edgy and Sam Raimi Lets Fly with All He's Got. Spidey. Goblin, Venom, and Sandman have Battle Scenes that are so Fantastic that they Literally Set the Bar for this Type of Thing.The Movie Exudes Excellence from the Get-Go. It's a Non-Stop array of Births, Transformations, and shifting Personas and Allegiances that are Bizarre, Befitting its Comic-Book Roots. This one is more Gritty than the Previous Films, with some Horrific Undertones. But also Included is some Black Comedy that Lightens the Mood, but Not for Long.Other returning Characters are here for Continuity. Of Course there's Mary Jane who provides a Love Triangle with Tragic Consequences and a Twist, J. Jonah Jameson, Aunt May, and this jam Packed Extravaganza also Introduces Gwen Stacey.There's as much here and More than anyone Could Expect and this Extraordinary Movie is Bursting with Bravado, and Sentimentality. An Underrated Comic-Book Movie that is Exceptional Entertainment and perhaps Over Time when this First Wave of Super-Hero Movies are Not Taken so much For Granted, its Reputation and Radiance will become more Appreciated. Nuff Said.","12 out of 19 found this helpful.

That is how I feel about the Spider-Man series. How many times do we have to see the damsel in distress (Kirsten Dunst)? And as for Ms. Dunst, she has the unique ability to annoy both on and off the screen. On screen, I have never found her that attractive and there is just some thing about her that rubs me the wrong way. When her character was in danger of plummeting to a painful death, I kept hoping that she would. No such luck. Many other folks feel the same way. As for off screen, when she was interviewed about the potential for a Spider-Man 4, she said, ""well, no one will come to see another one with out me and Tobey"". Guess again, Kirsten, 76% of those polled could care less if you reappeared! Now, as to the movie itself, about 20-30 minutes would have been better left on the cutting room floor. No one cares about Kirsten's performance in some stupid musical (in fact, I kept trying to find the ""fast forward"" button on my seat). And Tobey's performance as ""the bad"" Spider-Man was torturous and unfunny (Tom Welling makes a much better ""bad"" super hero when he is affected by red Kryptonite).As for the plot, it meanders around a lot before getting to some impressive special effects. I particularly liked the Sandman, despite the obvious logical problems (such as why is the sand solid one minute and then porous the nextbut hey, it is based on a comic book!). The Green Goblin II was pretty cool too. The other villain is somewhat of a surprise so I won't spoil it by revealing the identity of the last villain. My only problem with the villains is the writer's insistence on making them have a tragic back story that makes some of their villainy forgivable (they already did the same with Green Goblin I and Doc Ock). How about making the villain just be evil for evil's sake? So, to sum up my review, the movie is probably worth seeing on the big screen for the special effects and not much else. 6/10","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Of course, this ""moral"" is unworkable and therefore cannot be consistently applied. Spiderman will continue to go after the bad guys, whatever syrupy lessons May Parker may try to foist on him.

And I was disappointed, most definitely. While I love the character the two proceeding movies, this one suffered from the great third syndrome.Two things: Firstly, this movie splayed out at one end a romantic melodrama, on the other end, a serious metaphorical discussion of free will and good and evil, and yet on another a raucous slapstick comedy. And a runtime of 140 minutes, or 2 hours and 20 minutes is far too long for this movie. The scenes with the aunt, in my thinking, could have been all cut. She provided absolutely nothing to the movie, except cliché after idiotic cliché. It was half tedium to see her on the screen and half unintentional humor. When I was ten years old I bought the first six Venom Comics ""guest-starring Spider-Man"" and I thoroughly enjoyed that little series (Feb 1992  Jul 1992).The second thing: the special effects will most likely get an Oscar nomination (even though it is very far from that time). The Sandman special effects were awesome, some of the best shots in the movie. However, to me, I thought most of these special effects while most likely supremely expensive and meticulously crafted were too video-game like. Almost everything looked slightly animated, just ever-so-slightly but enough that any average viewer would notice this. My favorite comic book superhero of all time is Superman, and always has been. If anyone has the DVD to the first two movies in 1978 & 1980 with Christopher Reeve (shot as one continuous movie), you can see what great special effects are like. This was before digital photography, and all of these special effects in the first two Superman movies were done optically with so much planning, designing and practicing. It proposed they could make you believe a man could fly and they did do that. The effects in Superman & Superman II have not dulled with time. Effects of this magnitude cannot really be seen these days, and it is probably mostly a budgetary and time issue. Superman paved the way for creating an Oscar category for special visual effects, because in its time it didn't exist. The Superman special effects artists were awarded with a special achievement Oscar instead. Now this is a serious category every year at the Academy Award ceremony.Now I didn't hate Spider-Man 3, but it was nowhere near as great as Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2. It suffered kind of like Superman III suffered. In Superman III there was a mix of comedy and ""serious issues"", which reviewers didn't like. And Superman turned evil for a little while as well. Batman Begins was not afraid to take a beloved superhero and explore his dark side with a fictionalized version Bob Kane's origin story of the Bat-Man. That is one of best superhero movies made in a long while.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Just because a movie is called ""Spiderman"" doesn't give its makers license to indulge themselves at my - and it seems thousands of other - Spidey fans' expense. It seems that Raimi & Co (couldn't he afford a professional screenwriter?) should be charged with Culture Treason - for taking a treasured national icon and destroying it for personal gain.This picture reminds me of Titanic. There, the makers also knew that no matter how badly they wrote the story, people would pay money just to watch the spectacle of that great ship going down.Raimi & Sony are, of course, cackling with laughter all the way to the bank, while our beloved Spiderman lies dying in the gutter, coughing Spidey-blood.

This film finally delivers some of the dark feel that moves the comic-book genre away from children. With these pros in mind, the cons really detracted from the film. We saw a departure from good script writing for broad story (as in X3, only not nearly as bad). Some of the scenes just got flat out ridiculous, but never really hurt the whole feel of the film, it just kinda shocked you out of engrossment. This movie is not as likely to please as the last two, which made the superhero genre a good measure better. I have a feeling that the studio pressured Sam Raimi into making the film as big in scope as it was, but Raimi still pulled all the loose ends together masterfully. Bravo. The only people who should be angry about this film are comic-book junkies (Some films change superhero story lines for the better, guys) and people who are fed up with the super-hero glut of films (the world would be a better place without the likes of Ghost Rider and Fantastic Four). Overall, it was very enjoyable and still stands as one of the better examples of what a superhero film should be.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

With all 3 movies being directed by Sam Raimi, I had thought there would be a steady improvement. Maybe giving the Director story-writing control was not such a good idea. Here in my country, supermalls with 12 theaters are all simultaneously showing Spiderman 3. Comic-book fans will also not be impressed by the simplified translations. I prefer the comic book versions of Venom and Harry Osborne.

And yet again my anticipation was quickly deflated. It seems like every Spiderman movie catches me out like that. Anyway, the film is good. I know I started on a negative note, but it really is a solid film. The Sandman looks very good, and venom steals the show. It's a bit too long(as usual). There's a fantastic cameo from Bruce Campbell, which really nailed the Spiderman sense of humour, and it was good to see him again. The things that disappoint me are unfortunately rather important for a movie in that they are the two leading actors, Tobey Maguire fit the original part perfectly, but he has not matured, he remains the gormless, lost teenage geek. Kirsten Dunst turns out a very run of the mill performance, and has two rather unnecessary songs.Overall, I wasn't massively downhearted as it really only is Saturday afternoon entertainment, and Spiderman has never been the kind of film you would look forward to watching again.

But his world is quickly turned upside down as he comes under attack from Sandman, Goblin Jr and an alien substance that transforms Peter into something far darker than his super hero better self.There is a school of thought that says that sequels are always the tricky films for directors to take on, that may be so in most genres, but for comic book adaptations, all films are tricky. By the time of director Sam Raimi releasing Spider-Man 3, he had not only shown the world that he clearly loved the Spider-Man characters, he showed that he also knew how to better the franchise with the second instalment. So really, if we are all honest here, it was going to take a monumental effort to not just only better parts one and two, but to merely make a film to sit alongside those finely crafted pictures as well! That he managed neither is no great surprise when watching it now after the dust has settled a few years later. In his over eagerness to entertain us the fans, and with studio interference that Raimi to date refuses to over elaborate on (Venom-AKA Eddie Brock-it was-ahem-requested he find room for), Raimi lost sight of the less is more policy that made the first two Spidey movies great.When I first came out of the cinema after my original viewing, my head was chocked full of villains, not only that, but also Peter's love life struggles, it is in short, way too much for one movie. I had enjoyed myself for sure, hell! Raimi knows how to give his fans a good time, but when you break it own there are so many missed opportunities it grates substantially on the discerning movie watching fan. Thomas Haden Church is a fine actor, but as Marko he has little to do, so come the excellent transformation into Sandman, Church is a forgotten prop. Then there is the almost unforgivable act of losing James Franco {Goblin Jr} in amongst the collage of goings on, his Harry Osborn has a neat complexity to him and more attention to detail with this character arc would have provided great rewards I'm sure. Kirsten Dunst returns as Mary Jane but appears to be regressing in acting ability, is she bored I wonder? Or is she just not that very good an actress? The less said about Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom the better, tho in fairness Raimi never wanted the character in the film, so it's hardly surprising that the best thing about the character is the entertaining effects as Venom snarls and snaps. Bryce Dallas Howard is sparky as Gwen Stacy, and J.K. Simmons as usual owns every scene he is in.Yet in spite of my grievances, after my HD revisit to the film I find myself warming to the Raimi franchise misfire. Clever themes such as power and its devilish off shoots are fleshed out, while the humour here is possibly the best of the three films thus far. The romantic angle between MJ and Peter is given serious thought and dare I say it, an adult make over. Whilst Tobey Maguire really has improved as an actor with each subsequent film, not withstanding an ill advised Saturday Night Fever sequence, Parker's venture to the dark side is excellently realised by Maguire. But ultimately it's with the action sequences that many younger viewers judge a Spider-Man film by, and part three is not found wanting, with a double team ultimate smack down raising the bar in gloriously over the top enjoyment. 7/10At the time of writing the above Raimi had agreed to do Spider-Man 4, I feel sure that lessons would have been learned, as it is now, both Raimi and Maguire have left the franchise. The head honcho executives have other ideas for the next instalment.......","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Spiderman 3: Quite underrated, much better than expected.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4147796/?ref_=tt_urv","Achyut_Prashast_Singh","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur46915265/?ref_=tt_urv","29 April 2018","I remember watching the film some 11 years ago. In the present time, I didn't remember anything much, so I decided to watch the film today, in the highest quality (4K). I was surprised to find how underrated it is, and with this, it's pretty obvious that I loved the film.SPIDERMAN 3 has a great depth if seen carefully. There's nothing really disappointing about the film. It's entertaining, dark, funny, emotional, thought provoking and enthralling apart from being action-packed, thrilling and visually striking. In this film, Spidey is something like never before. Tobey Maguire has actually done a great job, and he impresses in every single scene he's present. His other side has been explored very well. The other actors have done an excellent job too; every single performance clicks. Emotionally too, this film is very gripping. The visual effects and action sequences are simply one of the best ones ever. 
The climactic action block is one of the best ones ever. The cinematography is remarkable, while the sound effects too are phenomenal. Another great thing is that there's a lot going on in the film, and none of it feels unnecessary. There's a lot of visible depth in the screenplay, and it doesn't just focus on one character. This too makes the film an impressive one. And I must not forget to say, I somewhat loved Black Spiderman even more and found him a bit cooler, even though it's the original Spiderman who's my favorite and remains unbeatable. I really loved Peter's dance too!Films like SPIDERMAN 3 are often underrated but they are nevertheless worth watching and collecting. This isn't just a great superhero film, but also a thought-provoking, heart touching action film.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

Along with the villains we have the ""dark"" side of Spider-man and the MJ, Gwen, Harry and Peter love triangle/square and the rise and fall of Brock all to deal with.2/ Far too many coincidences for my liking, the meteor falling that close to MJ and Peter, Sandman falling into some particle accelerator, Gwen's floor being demolished by the crane etc etc.........(its a comic-book movie though I suppose) 3/ Too many fight scenes.4/ The Gwen character, not a required element that the movie needed.5/ Sandman turning out to be Uncle Ben's killer, another story strand that was not required and just made the movie even harder to come together.The Positives- 1/ The effects are OUT-STANDING.2/ The fight scenes are spectacular. (too many though).3/ Acting, considering this is a comic-book/event movie the acting was top-drawer, especially from Tobey.4/ The fun factor, Bruce Campbell and J. K. Simmons are FANTASTICALLY funny. As is the ""dark"" Peter Parker.5/ The MJ/Peter love story, I genuinely felt sorry for the both of them and willed them to sort everything out. Kirsten performance was subdued but still impressive.6/ The Excitement factor, from the starting credits to the end credits this was none stop,yes the film was far too busy, but at least thanks to that the movie is extremely exciting throughout.7/ The ""dark"" Spider-man and Peter Parker. I believe the Sam (Raimi) could have dropped the whole Sandman character from this episode and introduced the black entity/""tormented"" Spider-man earlier which in turn would have given Venon/Brock some much needed extra screen time. But the ""dark"" suited Spider-man was an impressive part of the movie.Overall the movie was excellent, yes as I stated the film was far from immune to serious flaws, but I can genuinely say that I came out the theatre satisfied I had seen a GREAT Spider-man movie! 9/10- A great effort, and a high quality event/comic-book movie. Fingers crossed we get a 4th movie with the same cast involved, unlikely(?). Time will soon tell. This is very much worth the entry cost, just for the spectacle of it all!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I mean, you've got 3 villains, plus each of their backgrounds, MJ's troubles, Harry's numerous changes of heart, 2 different Spidermans, competition between Parker and Eddie Brock at the newspaper, Gwen Stacy, and more. What was great about Spiderman 2, was that the plot was much more visible and focused; all you had to deal with was Parker's inner struggle, and his relationship with MJ, and his fight against the villain, Doc Ock. Additionally, I thought the writing was a tad flat and uninspired; perhaps a surprise considering it was written by veteran, Alvin Sargent (although he wrote Spiderman 2 alone, but co-wrote 3 with Sam and Ivan Raimi - so maybe that had something to do with it).~Cast~ Really, no stand-out performances among the main cast. The character of MJ is a bit of a useless brat in this film, and I never much liked Kirsten Dunst, who doesn't make any of her feelings in the film look genuine. Tobey Maguire was competent, but was painful to watch during Peter Parker's eye-liner-clad bad boy scenes (yeah, what was that all about anyway? Talk about losing the plot!). Franco was annoying as he was in the previous two; but that's mainly due to the kind of character he had to work with. Still, he didn't make a convincing villain, and the same can be said for Topher Grace, who was irritating before he became the vastly under-written Venom. Much better were Thomas Haden Church, who succeeded in bringing us a villain for whom we had an ounce of sympathy. Bryce Dallas Howard played her part well, as did J.K Simmons (yet again). The highlight of the film, however, had to be Bruce Campbell as the Maître d'. Hilarious.~Music~ Bit of a mish-mash score here. Danny Elfman was hired, as he was for the previous two, but had a falling out with Sam Raimi and left the project. Christopher Young was brought in to score the film, but film chiefs thought he did a poor job and replaced some of his work with snippets of music recycled from previous Spiderman/Danny Elfman films. Still, the sentimental moments worked, and Christopher Young did a decent enough job. Even so, I think Elfman's scores, while they do the trick, have never been phenomenal in any respect.~Other~ For a film with a $260 million dollar budget, the effects didn't blow me away as I had much expected them to. The visuals in both the first two films weren't overly impressive either, so it didn't bother me all that much. The best parts (with regard to visual effects) were undoubtedly the Sandman's scenes.~Summary~ Well it kept me entertained for its lengthy running time. Solid cast, a plot that was overcrowded but enjoyable enough, and a lot of polish, owed to it's huge-ass budget. Should certainly appeal to the masses, and is likely to go on to be one of the most financially successful films of all-time. But after the great Spiderman 2, I can't help but think Raimi has let the side down a little.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Then I heard from friends attending the midnight preview that it was a horrid waste of time. I didn't care. I wanted so badly to love Spiderman 3 and walked into the theater with very high hopes.To say I was disappointed would be an understatement. First off, there was way too much going on, and every character in the film was underused. Bryce Dallas Howard is a wonderful actress, but hardly had time to shine. There were too many bad guys. Each bad guy had a fascinating story, however, and I wish that they were put in separate films so the audience could see more of them. The first two films had a great balance of action and romance, the third one too much romance. At the end of the film I felt as if nothing had been accomplished, like I had just sat through two and a half hours of nothingness. I was very bored.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

He's happy with all his Spider - Man fans, he's back to getting the highest grades in his class and he's planning to propose to Mary Jane. But then a strange black entity from another world crashes on earth in the form of a meteor. It bonds with Peter Parker and causes him to become arrogant and unpleasant, as he battles new villains (Including the Sandman, the best villain of the series in my opinion) and begins to seek revenge.As I stated before the acting is very good when compared to the prequels, every cast member gives a credible performance. The CGI is amazing, all though there are a few times when it becomes just a little too obvious. A few problems with the film is that it begins to drag towards the end, as it is 140 minutes long and 15 minutes longer than its prequels. The love story between Mary Jane and Peter went a little too deep in my opinion, and some of it seemed unnecessary. There are some incredibly corny lines, but what would you expect from this kind of film? Also, the strange black goo-like substance that attach's itself to Peter and makes him ""evil"" seemed a little forced. He wouldn't notice or even hear a meteor crashing down thirty meters away from him? And the fact it went after him out of all the millions of people living in New York seemed just a little too coincidental.Although in the end these problems are only small, as the positives heavily out weigh the negatives, as Spider - Man 3 is a great popcorn movie to lose yourself in for a few hours on a Friday/Saturday night. I feel that it does not deserve all the negative reviews. 8/10 - A must see for all Spidey fans, this film does not disappoint.","83 out of 172 found this helpful.

Both previous movies were good and stayed true to the comic story line. Most people didn't like this third installment out of the many to come (possibly 8 total), but I'll tell you why it was good.This movie took the storyline elements of the Spider-Man comics to the fullest here and introduced very important characters, like the Stacy family and Eddie Brock, and continues the life and times of Peter Parker in a short but well done way. The love interests Peter has in both Betty Ross and Gwen Stacy are portrayed well and get the point across, though not exactly like the comics.Forgiveness as the theme and moral of the story is put across directly and powerfully. Character conflict with Mary Jane and Peter is especially good and dramatic. Acting is successful and real like in the previous films and the action is fantastic, as always.Unfortunately, the film was too busy. Too much was going on with two villains and the drama. The excess of content lead to less character development, which left the villains not being as omnipotent and invigorating to the story as the other films. From a fan stand-point, Venom not being emphasized while attached to Parker or Brock was the most disappointing thing. All-in-all, this Spidey film is a good addition to its predecessors and is worth the watch despite its short comings.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's true that in my opinion, it lacked action, especially the final battle, but still, an iconic literary figure was brought to life on the big screen with respect, and creativity. The second one I really enjoyed. The action was insanely good, the personal story was touching, and I walked out of the theatre feeling quite good about what I just saw (as Dashboard Confessional played ""Vindicated"" during the credits). Now Spidey 3 comes out and I'm totally disappointed again. For starters, There was WAY too much crammed in one movie, so it lacked sufficient depth with most of the sub-plots. As a matter of fact the only character I was remotely pleased with was in fact Harry, who had a great story, and was portrayed really well by James Franco. However, you have the Sandman who just happens upon a scientific experiment that turns him into Sand/Human Hybrid. I'll let that one go. Next you have Topher Grace cast in the role of Eddie Brock/Venom. In the comics he was a body builder, intimidating in his own right, terrifying when fused with the symboite. As much as I like Grace, he did not fit the bill. And there was SO much more that could have been done with Venom. So much. Fans wanted him, not Mud Man!! To make matters worse, Gwen Stacy was in it and served no purpose, neither did her father. The fights were over the top, but were poorly balanced against bad stories in the background (like Peter and MJ fighting over nonsense and him being to dumb to just say ""yes dear""). The worst parts of the movie were: 1)Cool Guy Peter 2)The instant wrap-up of the Eddie Brock, not Venom, it was way too hasty. 3)The Butlers sudden wisdom 4)The terribly crappy fight in the end 5)The fact that Venom had like, zero screen time I dunno what it is about Marvel Movies that they cant pull of good trilogies (Xmen and Blade both dropped the ball on number three). You'd think this would be a slam dunk, but it wasn't. It was bad. It reminded me of Hulk and Superman Returns, both potential to be classics but they failed because the directors tried to improve upon what was already good. You let me down Mr. Rami. You let me down.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The thread of emotional struggles between love, hate, revenge, jealousy, envy, pride, etc, are fun to watch. But with so much going on and the tidy clean up at the end, you feel cheated somewhat.The bad; too many villains and too many subplots. This was not the time to introduce TWO new villains. I would have been content with just the introduction of either Venom or Sandman rather than throwing them both into the mix. The Sandman story needed much more time to develop, yet ends up taking too much time away from this film which ultimately causes the film to merely brush over the whole Venom storyline. I have to agree with many that the special effects seemed a bit too......well, like special effects. I found myself many times being taken out of the moment by sub-par character effects. The good; Gwen Stacy. I thought Howard was great. She is gorgeous, so much so that Kirsten Dunst looks rather plain compared to her. Jamison and all the supporting cast once again come with their A-game. Tobey is very good as is Dunst, though she by far is saddled with the least appealing character this go around.

Hes supposed to be dealing with all kinds of villains and difficulties....this movie covered all areas of the character. Sure there wasn't such a deep emotional content with this one but we've seen that already. If this movie was an hour longer just to tie up all the emotions, it would be a waste of time. All the fans want now is to see spidey face cool villains that have him beat....and win.","31 out of 58 found this helpful.

Not to mention the laughable 'evil peter Parker' dancing down the street like an idiot scene. The plot was hard to follow from start to finish even with knowledge of the first two films (who's only saving grace is that they were hardly as bad as the new one!) and was overly complicated by having two bad guys and a string of moral and romantic dilemma's all running at once. The cgi for such a high budget film was unconvincing, but was it supposed to be realistic? Maybe not but it should have been. There's only so much thread shooting and swinging from buildings that an audience can take. One positive: The police chiefs daughter was quite hot.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

I went and saw the movie and realized one thing. I can't trust anything anyone says until I go see the movie for myself. Spidey 3 does not only satisfy with breathtaking effects. The storyline goes along quite well although more Venom would of been nice. There is something to be said about a trilogy that makes you laugh, cry, and entertain with the best special effects. This is no X-men 3 or Matrix Revolutions. This is better than anything I have ever seen before in my life. I would encourage you to see this movie regardless of the Critics.","14 out of 23 found this helpful.

In fact, it took everything good about the second and added more action and excitement.Spider-Man 3 is not just a good comic book movie. It's a great movie period. Rarely have I gone through such a range of emotions during a film (not since SM2 anyway). Absolutely an incredible experience that everybody should be a part of and everybody should rush to see.The complexity, depth, heart and action were off the charts. I honestly can't remember when I saw a better movie. I totally agree with the film critic who said it's the best of the three movies due to the added complexities in its storytelling and the evolution and growth of the characters as a whole since the first movie. I was stunned that SM3 is actually an improvement on what was essentially a classic. I know many movies claim to have something for everyone but this one manages to pull it off while remaining interesting and compelling all the way through. There are spectacular action scenes as well as heartfelt family moments. There is romance and there is humor. I can't imagine anyone at any age not enjoying some aspect of this film.Director Sam Raimi, the cast, the crew and writers should all be proud of this masterpiece and take a bow. The only remotely negative thing I have to say about this movie is how can they possibly top it now? Then again, I said that after Spider-Man 2 so who knows? Bring on Spider-Man 4!","8 out of 42 found this helpful.

The film rolled up to speed and the requisite clapping and whoops ensued. 140 minutes and a polite applause later we filed out. All of us shook our heads, some shaking in confusion while others shook in unguarded disappointment. This, after all, was not the Spiderman 3 we had anticipated. It was something broader, something simpler, something light. But to call this third entry into the mega-franchise a complete blunder is a gross overreaction. It's more that the big gust of air Spiderman 2 inhaled in preparation for the big trilogy finish is not the same air exhaled in Spiderman 3. The film is still the same gosh-wow cinematic event it was three years agoonly this time around, things have gone a bit goofy. Things are as they were when we left Spiderman swinging through the steel and concrete canyons of the Manhattan skyline in 2004. He's still with the budding Broadway starlet Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and still at odds with his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), who now seeks revenge for his father's death. Peter's lost in romance and fame, anticipating a city festival in Spiderman's honor and spinning webs for him and MJ to lie upon beneath the shooting stars. He's pitching the idea of a marriage proposal to his widowed Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and excelling in school with his lab partner/supermodel Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard). Yep, things are good in Spidey-land; and especially good when Harry awakes from a harsh concussive coma to have forgotten Peter's involvement in his father's death. But leave a particle physics experiment and an alien meteorite alone long enough and you're bound to face a stray supervillain. So inevitably, it isn't long until Sandman (Thomas Hayden Church) and Venom are on the loose, robbing banks and infecting enterprising photographers (Topher Grace) like supervillains tend to do. What's changed most here is the text behind the production. The original Spiderman was penned by David Koepp, screen writing veteran of Jurassic Park, Mission: Impossible and War of the Worlds. Spiderman 2 brought on board Alvin Sargent, a quieter writer known for Robert Redford's Ordinary People and the adultery riff, Unfaithful. This time around, Sam Raimi and his older brother Ivan penned the script with the help of Mr. Sargent. Sam Raimi's writing credentials include The Evil Dead, Evil Dead II, and Army of Darkness. Though all three films are giddily remembered in all the majestic cheeseball glory, none of them would be considered the right material for the third entry into this multi-billion dollar franchise. And who trusted Sam's older brother Ivan to help put this story into theatres? Ivan's a doctor, not a writer. Anyway, this family pairing gave Spiderman 3 the wily gift of Camp humor. And Camp is something like the ugly lovechild of Satire and Parody: mischievous and unwieldy. When it works, it works (e.g. Evil Dead). When it doesn't work, the backlash from the audience can be fierce. And in Spiderman 3, the backlash will be vociferous. The sequence most in question finds Peter Parker under the control of Venom, the alien parasite that, when infected, transforms its host into the manifestation of its worst character traits. We expect the grimmer, haunting side of Spiderman to rear its head here. Instead, Raimi gives Peter the emo hair-flip and pencils in black eye-liner. He dances in the street and gives the eye to girls walking past. He goes to a jazz club and showcases his surprise piano talents, dancing on top of the piano and picking a fight with the bartender while jutting his crotch out towards the ladies. And if that weren't an awkward enough addition to the Spiderman legend, Raimi poses all of this as a quasi musical dance number. So if nothing else, it is a fascinating and hideous thing watching the colossal Spiderman franchise nearly cannibalize itself in a matter of two short scenes.Luckily, the action sequences are nothing if not spectacles, as usual. The feats of CGI workmanship are as we've come to expect from the Spiderman franchise, the perspective whirling about as if through the eyes of a highly enraged bumble-bee. If you aren't nauseated, you'll be amazed. The villains are the best they've yet been, with Sandman showcasing the state of artistic digital animation and the creepy, parasitic Venom living up to its insatiable hype by the film's end. It's all structured so as to make the action into fresh and sugary prizes for enduring the lesser story bits forced in between. Spiderman has always pretended to be story-driven. And in the first two films the script was convincing enough so that we shrugged our shoulders and played along. But the Raimi brothers have indulged maybe too sloppily into comic book traditions this time and have let their story stray into something of an unintended joke. But for a franchise that relies on the tent-poles of event summer cinema, Spiderman 3 is still a blissful two and a half hour block of escapist fun. Though it's lighter and maybe dumber, it's still pretty and it's still electric. Samuel Osborn","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

From falling debris to the fighting sequences - the special effects are superb.I felt the inclusion of three villains here is what really makes the film. Three villains with their own fantastic backgrounds and relationship with Parker. I have got to say I really love the cast - a top job was done here also. And, very surprisingly, there was some good comedy in here also! Spidey 3 really has everything you could ever hope for in a film. I'll keep quiet about the storyline details, but it was very well done. It was intense, funny, and sometimes sad, but just a great movie overall.

It assumed that there needed to be more, more villains, more action, higher stakes, and at the end the film suffered for it.The Green Goblin, Venom, the Sandman, there were three major villains and three villain stories to tell and as a result the film lost focus.Not that it didn't have it's charms.Topher Grace isn't exactly the buff Eddie Brock we know from the comic books, but he works splendidly in a Raimi vision of Spider Man. He is the perfect foil for Tobey Maguire's character.Thomas Haden Church doesn't exactly fall to the bottom either. He adds a depth to a character that is allowed only so little screen time in a jumbled film.The problem isn't with the cast, the cast was great. And as usual Raini does an excellent job at directing.It's not as horrible as people say.The problem comes in with the plot itself, the script, there was too much.The tags the trailers, everything hinted towards Venom and Venom should have been the driving force behind the film. Had they stayed with a singular villain and not cut the movie into three little plot lines, it would have been a nicely streamlined success.Instead, however, they tried to throw too many at the audience at once, just like they did with the Batman movies, and just like Batman Forever and Batman and Robin, Spider Man 3 became a disjointed mess of a film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Simply put, the negative reviews for this film are from people who know very little, or nothing, about Spider-Man.This film follows quite closely to a couple of story lines in the Spider-Man Universe and certainly helps develop the character of Peter Parker. Essentially, the first two films were not the end of Peter's growth as a hero and as a man, and this can easily turn some people off. The turnoff is honestly for those who want instant gratification, they don't want dialog, they want a fight. Spider-Man 3, in my opinion, does a fantastic job bringing BOTH to the table.It's very difficult to teach the entire backdrop of the Spider-Man stories to those who are not familiar with the comics because it took 40+ years to produce them (and would take a very long time to summarize for those who have not read them). Is this movie perfect? No, but no movies are, every movie is with flaws and we are not long to point them out.If everyone knew, however, the complete history of Spider-Man, they would be quite happy with this film. Without giving spoilers, I can honestly tell you that this movie is very much worth your time and money. The acting was very good, the dialog was emotional when it needed to be, serious when it needed to be and sometimes, just funny. Bring your family and enjoy, this movie is ANYTHING but a let down. Like I pointed out before, I suspect the negativity is coming from people who know absolutely nothing about Spider-Man.Period.","45 out of 91 found this helpful.

"6","/10","well, the trilogy is now RUINED","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1746061/?ref_=tt_urv","Netscape_Navigator","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3070483/?ref_=tt_urv","14 October 2007","I loved the first two, I gave them both 10s. It's amazing how much of a joke this is compared to the first two. Although this one isn't completely terrible, the quality level is nowhere near the others, this one just feels so sloppy. There's three main reasons why this movie was a joke compared to the first two: REASON 1: It lacks all of the humanity that made the first two so great. The first two movies had great characters that were well written, and had motivations for everything they did. Nothing that the Green Goblin or Doc Ock did felt arbitrary. Their very existence was written in a very believable way, and all their actions and crimes had purpose to them to achieve some end goal. Tell me again, WHAT exactly was Sandman up to again the whole time?REASON 2: Humor was too over the top. This series has always been known for its tongue in cheek type campy humor, and it worked great in the first two. Here it felt so forced, there were so many cringe inducing scenes. From the overplayed gimmick of that desk buzzer ringing loudly at J. Jonah Jameson's desk (it's funnier if you do it just a couple times... not ONE HUNDRED times), to the absolutely horrific child actors and the terrible lines they were made to speak, everything was so over the top. During the climax of the movie, they completely slowed the movie down by putting in what felt like a 5 minute scene of Jameson asking that little girl for her camera, as she replied with all the acting talent of 2007's Bionic Woman. It's crazy that someone consciously put that unnatural scene in there. The whole thing is just so wrong.REASON 3: Too many subplots. I guess this pretty much ties in to Reason 1, the very reason why every character was shallow and paper thin was because this movie had one too many villains. Neither of the villains got enough time to be developed, and every time they show up it all feels so disjointed. They should've taken out one of the villains, and went much much deeper into one of the subplots, such as Peter's inner struggle. It would've been very interesting to see a truly dark, evil Spider-Man, and not an eyeliner wearing dancing buffoon. Scenes that were poorly written:**When Peter was looking at the ring in his hand, and Mary Jane unexpectedly knocks, why was he fumbling around as to where to hide the ring, only to eventually put it in his pocket? Wouldn't his pocket be the FIRST choice?**The scene where Gwen Stacy perilously hangs off the building, as her boyfriend and father look on calmly and talk to each other. I'm at a total loss of words here.**The butler dude that out of nowhere, all of a sudden deciding to tell Harry that his father's wounds came from his glider, so THEREFORE the wounds were self-inflicted. Was the script writer on CRACK here??**You could really tell the writers had no idea how to justify the meeting of Venom and Sandman with the way they had them just conveniently meet by chance, and say, ""we both hate him, wanna team up real quick?"" That should be a felony to write something like that.**I think this is more of an opinion based on my own understanding of the world, but I'm completely confused about how Peter could kiss Gwen Stacy in front of his girlfriend and not realize it's a big deal?**The ending of Sandman's story arc. He might as well have just stayed home if he's just gonna pathetically wisk away like that in the end with nothing resolved. What was that?This could've been a great movie had they tightened up the script, trimmed off the fat, left off one of the villains, and focused on the core of the story. Instead they made it into a cartoony, childish extravaganza that trips over itself trying to do too many things. I waited 3 years for this movie to come out...","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was not a sequel , it was a spoof of Spiderman. As far as I'm concerned there are only a Spiderman 1 and 2. I'm going to go into denial and push Spiderman 3's very existence out of my mind. Sam , please don't make a new Evil Dead , let it be. If Sam kills his best work , i wont see another one of his movies again. BOOOOOOOOOOOOO! For shaaaaaaame , just another sold out ,run of the mill , unoriginal Steven Spielberg kinda guy now huh Sam.

If, like me and my group of friends, you are a fan of the comic series, you will be too. 1) Sandman is supposed to be sick and twisted, not a misunderstood man, down on his luck, trying to do something good, but going about it the wrong way. 2) Venom is the greatest threat to Spiderman, more than any other villain, because he can do everything Spiderman can do, but Spidey's spider sense doesn't work with Venom (and it is pure evil and cannot be killed with anything smaller than a fuel-air bomb). I'm not even going to say what he did with Harry, it is simply outrageous.I think the director spent too much time playing therapist, trying to give Spiderman some closure, resolving his issues. Spiderman is a superhero. As such, he is a tragic figure, like all super heroes. They don't get closure, but they fight on despite their deep inner turmoil, that is what makes a super hero heroic. So go ahead and see Spiderman in theaters, the DVD won't be worth the money.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Drama, excitement, incredible action scenes, good triumphing over adversity and so on. The third failed on all of these levels. Firstly it took ages to get going and was overly sentimental, secondly it had too many villains and as a result failed to develop any of them fully, thirdly the action scenes were poorly choreographed and confusing, fourthly...you get the picture.It seems as though Raimi wanted to include as much as possible in as short amount of time as possible which resulted in glaring inconsistencies, weak character development and many unexplained occurrences. However all, yes all of these things stand pale in inadequateness when compared to the strutting ""emo"" Peter Parker, which, was the moment when I utterly gave up on the film.Someone please annihilate this film from existence and do it again...please.","12 out of 24 found this helpful.

The beauty of the film lies in its action, with its superb visual effects. Although I didn't feel he was required, Flint Marko's transformation into Sandman is truly mind-blowing. Tobey Maguire is really awesome as the new ""changed"" Peter Parker and does some really good acting. James Franco's role as Harry Osborne is lovable, and, at the end of the movie, I felt he was the real hero, not Spider-Man. And story-wise, maybe Spider-Man 2 had a better storyline.Venom was given way too less screen time (4 minutes). Venom deserves an entire movie to himself, he's Spider-Man's toughest enemy! The music is very good, the music that is played in the opening credits are really good. But sometimes the film loses it's pace. J.K. Simmon's role as J.J. Jameson is very comical, specially his first seen, where he is seen ""trying"" to control his anger. Topher Grace fitted very well in Eddie Brock's role, plus he got some of the best dialogues as well! The film is just superb! I enjoyed the movie... I'm looking forward to Spidey 4... and I can't wait for the DVD!","31 out of 60 found this helpful.

However Spiderman 3 is one of the worst films i have ever seen to be honest it is terrible. The film struggles to make clear partition between action, comedy and musical, with Kursten Dunst having two singing numbers in the film one wonders is she trying to launch a singing career.The comedy was the worst with the audience bursting into laughter but at the end of the film no one could remember why.Acting, well what can be said besides what acting , at best it was wooden with Toby McGuire's illusive fake wide eyes looking like he was high through out the film and Kursten Dunst's fake crying where all you can see is her second chin wobble below her jaw.The action when it arrives is good, very stylised but it lacks continuity. The fight scenes are over to fast except for the last one which just keeps on going as all the audience are on the edge of their seats to leave the cinema because they have been bored all the way through.Listening to the audience leave the cinema, showed how terrible this film is. All were complaining that it was too long, there are two many bad guys non with particularly great motives.In conclusion all i can say is save your money, this film shows me why people download movies because they save money on ridiculously expensive tickets and they don't have to sit through 2 and a half hours of an emo peter parker! Well Done Sam Raimi you ruined the trilogy!","21 out of 47 found this helpful.

In Spider-man 3, Sam Raimi is given complete control of the film, and he produces one of the greatest works of art in the entirety of human history. The horrid dialogue and sub-par acting only help to enhance the best comedy of the year. The 2 and a half hour long epic was mostly worthless and boring, but the stretch of comedy where Peter Parker becomes a failed emo womanizer is worth every second of it. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who has the slightest bit of a humor hidden somewhere in their body. Any Evil Dead fan will feel right at home with the jovial jokes spread throughout. If you are a real fan of Spider-man, stay clear. If you're drunk and want to enjoy an evening laughing at bad actors, go see this movie this very instant.

Unfortunately this one, while still being OK, didn't quite measure up to the lofty heights of the first two, for a number of reasons.The plot revolves around Peter Parker ( Tobey Maguire ) at a high point in his life- his relationship with Mary Jane ( Kirsten Dunst ) has never been better, he's getting top graders in his classes, and Spider-Man is now regarded as the hero that he truly is. However this is soon shattered as Harry Osborn ( James Franco ) begins to plot his revenge on Parker. Furthermore, Uncle Ben's killer, Flint Marko ( Thomas Haden Church ) has been transformed into something else- the Sandman. Add to that the new black costume, which is much more than it seems.The fact is, that despite it being a two and a half hour movie, nothing gets truly covered well enough and there is the same fight sequence at the end of the movie. The best scene in the whole movie, in fact, involves Bruce Campbell as a hilarious waiter that seems to be channeling Inspector Clouseau. Many of the movies better moments, besides the action sense, involved humour in some way.And then there's Venom, who they don't really know how to design as his head isn't quite big enough to look right. Instead it almost looks like his mouth has been drawn on separately with a life of its own.Spider-Man 3 crams too much into one movie and as such has to use dumb plot devices to keep the story moving ( there is one near the end that will have people screaming 'why?!' ). It moves too fast for the plot to work, but it's the plot's too cumbersome and unwieldy anyway.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This what this film, more so than the first 2 capture. Examples of this would be in comic books, we are taken from scene to scene, a picture board if you will (which is what a comic action hero is)that are segments, fragments of plot.At first they seem like bits and pieces, but then those bits and pieces come together and form the particular comic book series number of that month. This what this film is and it is spot on a perfect adaptation of that style. It is an adaption I have never seen done more perfectly than this film achieves.Spiderman 1 had some of these elements. The second film went away from that and was more like a glorified soap opera.This one by far gets it, and gets it dead on right.Some people are complaining about all the simultaneous plot line occurring in this film, that "" they are too much for such a short span of time"". << EXACTLY!! For those people who say that, how often did you read action cartoon comic books?THAT IS EXACTLY HOW THEY ARE!! This is a brilliantly done film, it delivers to those who truly want a true comic book adaptation.It is not meant to be totally cohesive and brilliant in the sense of a real life film.IT IS A COMIC BOOK ACTION HERO ADAPTION, and the best I have ever seen.Go into the Movie with that in mind and you will see most people are not GETTING IT!!I did and I really loved it!!","29 out of 56 found this helpful.

However, before watching it, we noticed a certain exaggeration due to the company, directors and businessmen in the industry who want to make the film a box office breakthrough and not a dramatically textual and perfect quality film by writing. The creation of a Black Spiderman who was possessed by an alien force is unnecessary and the creation of 3 villains even less. But among the villains is one that completes a cycle well done throughout the journey of the Spider, his friend Harry. That in the previous plot he discovers that his father's ""killer"" (Green Goblin) is Parker, and in this film he returns with all his energy focused on Peter's revenge and overthrow, both in his personal life and in that of a superhero. The film has great special effects, with the beautiful flying scenes of Spiderman and the battle scenes in a skyscraper in New York are epic; the main characters are the same, with the same actors and unfortunately they discovered the beautiful and talented Bryce Dallas Howard only in the third, because she convinces much more than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane. The new characters keep the film's focus on Peter's personal and heroic struggle. The film ends in great style completing a beautiful saga of this who is one of the best superheroes in the history of cinema and who will have his flights and struggles immortalized in cinema.Film seen on August 13, 2020.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Given that, I am happy to see the way in which the writers have set up the pre-cast characters of their choice (Given that everyone Peter Parker ever touches becomes a bad guy they had a wide range). I found that they took a way to comedic approach to a movie that is supposed to be a boy gets girl thing. I mean, come one! They did know that scene walking down the street was the text book definition of over kill, didn't they? That said, they did a good job on the Goblin, Venom and The Sandman. The composer has done an excellent job even with his supercilious lot. The different themes for the costumes and music for the 'new look spidey' scenes.

Yes i agree with the critics, 3 stars suits the features of the film. It was a excellent, awesome, and hilarious film but some parts i LOVED, and others i didn't care for. Many things were packed into this film, and my favorite was the Spider-Man and Venom conflict, by far. Even though the film did a great job on the special effects, i mean a fabulous job, Venom should have been bigger and more muscular. My two favorite characters were the Anti-Spidey and Venom, the two funny characters in the film: Ant-spidey, funny and selfish, Venom/Eddie Brock, selfish with self centered funny comments. Go see this film, but get to the theater 1 hour and 20 minutes early, for parking, waiting in line for tickets, getting a satisfactory seat, going to the bathroom and getting you concession stand food and drink. Once the movie starts, enjoy the action, drama, and selfish humor that makes the spidey franchise what it is, i mean you always have to have at least one funny villain.

Who the hell even care how much Venom YOU want to see in this movie? This is Sam Raimi's movie and he does NOT like Venom.Spiderman 3 had an excellent script, an excellent ensemble of characters that delivers an excellent, integrated central theme with a multitude of side plots to drill into. At the same time, it defies newton laws and laws of relativity as per usual and provides us with some of the greatest action sequences without seeing heads fall or limbs severed. OK, maybe sand limbs, but they're not real...But apparently a lot of the viewers got perplexed. Things apparently have grown out of their scope of understanding and they don't like it. Funny, because an equally if not more confusing and complicated movie won best picture last year. What was that, oh, that was The Departed. Perhaps it's the lack of swearing in Spiderman that spelled its doom.Or perhaps it's because people don't find REAL LIFE relationship issues, REAL LIFE quagmire of hatred and vengeance, all that interesting, or at all important to be shown on big screen. I beg to differ. I think Spiderman 3 has not only achieved to illustrate, in graphic colors, how severed a relationship can be with the slightest miscommunication, how quickly can a simple vengeance spiral out of proportion before the world is at stake, it has also delivered some of the best antidotes and cures, in the most simple, common words.Unlike some other films that expose ugly social issues and walk away without cleaning up the mess. Spiderman is up close and personal and soldiers on. Unfortunately... it is too much ahead of its time, or perhaps any time.","14 out of 24 found this helpful.

There are a number of story lines dealing with Spiderman, with Parker and with a number of other characters, and they all mix well together and builds up to the final scenes of the movie. The three major villains ensures that the melodrama doesn't get too boring, like I think it did in Spiderman 2.Tobey Mcguire is a bit wooden in Spiderman 3. It's the way he played Spiderman in the previous movies, but it doesn't work very well here. I hate to say it, because he is so good in many other movies, but I think he is one of the weak points in Spiderman 3. The rest of the cast is good, and like many others I liked Bruce Campbells performance very much, though it was brief.The fight scenes works fine, especially the last one, and in particular the Sandman special effects. But some people may find the movie too slow.There is nothing new or original in Spiderman 3, not even a major villain, but the crew gets the job done, and fans of Spiderman will probably find it very good.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

How enough of you have voted it into the region of 7/10 is an utter mystery to me and in writing this article, I feel like the only sane voice in an insane world.Just to say it out loud - this film was to the Superhero genre what David Hasslehoff is to pop music - an embarrassment. (Sorry Hoff, you are a legend but only the Germans are tone deaf enough to buy any of your records - stick to TV, the camera loves you).I for one did not go to the cinema yesterday and part with nearly £30 (allowing for fiancée in tow and the usual mortgage to buy a small coke and popcorn) to see a horrendous love story, crammed full of nauseating schmaltz about the love between a man and a woman, a man and his friend, a man and his aunt, a different man and his sick daughter, a spider and a gooey black alien, etc. etc. I paid that money to see Spiderman kick some ass, rescue a bunch of people, throw around some really heavy stuff with his super strength, and generally save the day.Don't even get me started about the ""humour"" that was attempted within the film. On what felt like at least a dozen occasions I found myself sliding out of my seat, trying to hide myself from the rest of the audience in case anyone recognised me watching the worst film of 2007 (it would have been the worst film of the last decade, were it not for ""The Thin Red Line"" - 1998).For anyone planning to make a Superhero film from here on in, do yourself (and more importantly the rest of us) a favour, and do two things. First, watch Batman Begins, then, phone Christopher Nolan and ask him to Direct your movie. That is the kind of gritty, action packed film people want to see, with an excellent script and perhaps most importantly, a plot.I was going to end this article, Spiderman R.I.P., but Batman was salvaged so there is hope, but the current franchise has certainly sent Spidey towards the plug hole.......","15 out of 32 found this helpful.

That's not sand choking you... it's the three plots that could easily each be a movie in itself. The writing has already been mentioned. It's impossible to do justice to that much content, and while it is a mess at times, it doesn't do as bad as could be expected. This has fewer cringe-inducing moments than the first two, but what there is is potent. For the first time in the trilogy, I actually laughed when I was meant to(and quite a few times where I wasn't). I wouldn't object to every single frame that contains singing and dancing in this to be excised, and possibly torched. The action is engaging and cool. I never found Maguire threatening. The added characters are underused, not developed enough and kind of a waste of a lot of fantastic comic material. Like the second flick, this didn't have a finished script ready when production began, and oh boy did it show this time. They managed to work it out on that sequel, not with this one. It still looks excellent. The effects are astounding. There are memorable sequences in this. The cast is all great. Grace obviously doesn't make an impressive, well, if you should know what he plays, you probably already do, so to avoid spoilers, I won't put it here. I get why they gave him the role, and his performance isn't ""poor"", as such. It's unfortunate that the decision was made to jam so much into this one, when it could be better if split up. All in all, this is entertaining, if not as dramatic and epic as it would like to be. There are several featurettes, most of which I will review at their respective entries on this site, photo galleries, trailers(for this and other flicks), a music video and two commentary tracks, a Raimi & actors one, and a film-makers(producers) one. I recommend this to those looking for a fun follow-up to the first two, that tries for, and generally succeeds reasonably at, being as deep and interesting as its immediate predecessor. 7/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was really painful to watch all things go into the toilet and sitting there, with no escape, witnessing the horror that brought this franchise to hell.This movie was really cheesy.Every scene popped out of nowhere and expects us to know what is going on? Really though, so many gaps, so many flaws, and this franchise is suffering right now and I'm preying that this movie was all just a big joke to laugh at and they'll show the real 'Spider-Man 3' on July 4th competing with 'Transformers'. I really doubt that's happening, but I'm still preying because the only way this franchise is saved is:1) They fix up 'Spider-Man 3' as much as they can to let people know that this is the real movie in the franchise from what 'Spider-Man' and 'Spider-Man 2' brought.2) They make 'Spider-Man 4' spectacular with great drama, great action, and a really mind-blowing story that'll make us all forget the tragedy 'Spider-Man 3' gave us.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I didn't expect this ending but, in retrospect, it was the most satisfying ending and befitting spiderman's character.Are there clichés in the movie? Yes, there are and in spite of them, this is a wonderfully entertaining production.The magic of the previous movies is still there in the third feature. No matter what whining reviews you may have read, characters are well developed - in fact, any more development and we could have watched Hamlet instead.The two new villains are completely different in terms of personality and motive. Sandman succeeds in moving the audience on more than one occasion whereas Venom inspires mostly contempt. Watch the scene when sandman quietly emerges for the first time. The gentle movements, the music and the pathos are brilliant and it is a scene I would want to watch over and over again.This is also a story of revenge and the liberation of forgiveness. Without it, it wouldn't be a great movie - it would be an ordinary one about evil and retribution. Spiderman 3 continues to rise and to deliver its messages about the paradox of being both good and bad, about being small and magnanimous, cruel and merciful - and human.","9 out of 14 found this helpful.

Not only did it ramp up the quality of the action set pieces and visual effects considerably from its predecessor (the entirety of what most action blockbuster sequels encompass) but it also tracked and maintained the natural progression of all the characters involved, based on what was left after the first film. It wasn't afraid to further explore the emotional weight that comes with been a teenage superhero, nor to flesh out a villain that was sympathetic and not entirely malevolent. This, along with the perfect interplay of comedy and dazzling action made SM2 in my opinion the perfect comic-book movie. No surprise then that I had high hopes for this second sequel (as if no one else did!). From what had already passed and with a considerably bigger budget ($250 million +, the trailers prove that alone), Sam Raimi and co. were looking to once again up the stakes in all areas. But surely no one can beat the ""perfect"" comic-book movie?All is rosy and right with our friendly neighbourhood Spiderman at the outset of his latest adventure. In stark contrast to what began the first sequel, the man sized creepy crawly is the toast of the city, now balanced perfectly with alter ego Peter Parker's straight A student life and blooming Broadway beau Mary Jane Watson, who is now aware of Peter's secret. However, not all is serene under the screen. Peter's best friend, Harry Osborn, is still seeking revenge for his father's death and now that he knows who's behind the mask of his adversary, he can finally squish the bug from the source by continuing is father's legacy as the New Goblin.Enough for the latest episode you say? Well barely half an hour in, at least three more plots surface; during a night under the stars for Peter and MJ, a meteor strikes covertly close by, subsequently releasing a writhing, crawling black ooze that manages to hitch hike home with Peter that same night; a rival photographer in the form of Eddy Brock (Topher Grace) is slithering his way into the Daily Bugle as Spiderman's new photographer, much to Pete's disdain; Flint Marco (Thomas Hayden Church) is a runaway criminal and allegedly the real killer of Peter's Uncle Ben (a major plot motivation) who ends up accidentally trapped in an elaborate experimentation chamber that turns him into a disintegrating sand monster, aka the Sandman.So after two paragraphs I've basically described almost the entire setup act. This is nothing we haven't seen in the trailers and even more is yet to come. There's the case of Spidey's black suit, Gwen Stacey (Bryce Dallas Howard) as the rival love interest, Venom and not to mention how all this affects Peter and MJ's relationship. People who are familiar with the comics or have seen the trailers will be aware of most of these plot points so I'm not going to elaborate, and for those who aren't aware, well, I don't have the space.Yes, Spider-Man 3 is stuffed when it comes to content. The filmmakers have clearly seen this as possibly the capper on the trilogy so they decided to add in as many popular characters, villains and stories as possible while settling a number of plot lines started in the first two films. What results is at times an immensely entertaining film with action set pieces and special effects that out do its predecessors, trademark moments of zany and self aware comedy (Spidey empties his boots of sand after a long bout with the Sandman, asking himself ""Where do these guys come from?"") and our favourite characters portrayed perfectly by skilled actors. But by the end there's a distinct sense that everything else that the other films nailed could have gone smoother had they reduced the content.This movie has enough to span at least two and to be honest that's probably what should have happened. While the black suited Spiderman is partly the result of the Sandman's existence, due to Peter's thirst for revenge for his uncle's true killer (feeding the black clinging symbiote), it could have been left for another film, leaving Peter to deal with the Sandman, Harry and MJ here. That's more than enough to engage for 2 hours. As much as I loved Peter's new attitude with the black suit and all the comedy that ensued, the development needed more time to illicit the sense of struggle in the character (Black Spidey is hardly seen in action nor are the symbiote's origins thoroughly explained).Venom is another example. Probably the most infamous villain in the comic books, he's given nothing more than 20 minutes of screen time here, making him seem like a complete after thought, just shoehorned in for popularity's sake. He looks cool and his eventual appearance sticks to the source, but it's too little of too much too late. Along with the black suit, Venom should have been reserved for another film. New villains, especially of this ilk, need that time to develop. Venom and Sandman each deserved a full length feature at least.Despite these annoying flaws, there's no denying Spider-Man 3 is still a very entertaining comic-book film due its incredible action (New Goblin vs Peter can take the prize for that), gorgeous special effects (Sandman's first appearance is a short film in and of itself due to its beauty alone) and show stopping comedy (Bruce Campbell once again has a hilarious cameo). It's never boring despite the length and the pacing is fairly consistent. It's also the most fun you'll have at the movies thus far this year, so I recommend it for that alone. But as an entry in the superior Spider-Man saga, it falls behind number 2's stunning all round quality and even number 1's tight plotting. In the end, they really couldn't improve on the perfect comic-book movie. Go figure!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Peter Parker was always a refreshing, nerdy take on the super-hero, and decent characters combined with lovely effects, art-direction, lovable cast, and dialog made the first movie great, the second a bit less so.Sadly, the third installment of Spider-Man fails to impress as much as it's predecessors. Here, we meet a new and interesting Parker and company, but it somehow feels constructed. The characters reasoning becomes clichés, uninspiring and hard to relate to. There are also allot of new faces in this movie. Whether it's setting the stage for a follow-up, or just a means to trying to top the previous movies, they simply become to many in too little time, making the movie in some ways resembling Parker's own way of swinging through the city from action to action.Probably, there will be a director's cut of this movies at some point, and if it adds another 30-40 minutes of film allowing us to get to know the characters better, Spider-Man 3 might as well score as high as eight. But for now however, with all it's swinging about, it's a six.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Only weakness is Kirsten Dunst.Comedy: 8/10. J.K. Simmons was (as always) amazing. The whole Emo Peter thing was funny! Sometimes a little overdone (Jazz Club) but overall funny! Action: 10/10. Best Action Sequences of all 3! Sandman was very interesting as far as effects go! Overall: 9/10, not as good as Spider-Man 2 but what did you expect? This movie was very underrated but I loved it and thought it was a lot of fun!","10 out of 16 found this helpful.

It is no secret that the vision of Sam Raimi for the Spider-Man franchise is that of a love story, but to continue milking the whole ""star cross lovers"" angle up to a third movie, got old really fast. The way that this film was conceived was to sum up the previous two so there is bound to be unresolved issues. But to continue picking at that particular scar in the life of Peter Parker shows lackluster by the creating team. Spider-Man notoriety as a bad luck magnet is well established in the comics and there is a ton of problems that have a negative effect in the life of Peter to choose from, aside from women problems. Without giving too much away here is a little dissection of the film.Performances Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man/Peter Parker I was hopping to see a more evolved version of Spidey comic-wise. More wisecracks and less mopping around. And we do get to see a little bit of that but nothing alike the comics.Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson We see her character devolve more into a redhead version of Kristen Dunst and we definitely see less of Mary Jane Watson in her performance.James Franco as New Goblin/Harry Osborn This guy stole the show. Swinging back and forth between Peter's best friend and a homicidal maniac out for Pete's throat, he easily gave the best performance of the movie. I would have loved to see the costume department come up with a better version of the Goblin costume though.Thomas Haden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko Not so different from the comic book version. Thomas Haden Church delivered a solid performance.Topher Grace as Venom/Eddie Brock A very good portrayal of Edward Brock Jr. and a lame version of Venom. 'Nuff said! The rest of the performances were OK. Bryce Dallas as Gwen Stacy sold her character fairly well. As always Rosemary Harris (May Parker) did an excellent job and so did J.K. Simmons as crazy J. Jonah Jameson. There was nothing special about James Cromwell performance as Captain Stacy and Dylan Baker didn't brought nothing new to the table while continuing his role as Dr. Curt Connors. As expected Bill Nunn (Joseph 'Robbie' Robertson) Bruce Campbell (as the Maître d') and Elizabeth Banks (Miss Brant) deliver the goods in their respective roles. The extras in the movie could have done a better job selling their reaction to the surroundings. The kids in the movie did a better job than the adults.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Maybe I'm too into comics and the story or there's something wrong with me, but this movie jumps around too much like a frog. Let's face it Marvel and Sam Raimi were looking to make money and how else but another movie. Please hear me, Sam Raimi leave the writing to someone who can write a well rounded story, not looking to put butts in the seats. How does a crew based on capitalizing on a story and a trend kill off one of the books top character, Venom. This movie was like the Venom commercial, a few minutes long. And Toby dancing around and being overtaken by the symbiotic suit was more of a joke than almost anything other than trying to pack all the new villains into this film. So Sam if you can here me concentrate more on the story than your fancy CGI. Please Sandman wasn't awful but towards than end he lost most physical characteristics and began looking like a heap of something for the final fight. And the only way to bring the Sandman as the real killer of Uncle Ben was ridiculous, and just so we had another character to lose track on with the jumpy story line and lousy plot. The only thing these films seem to truly follow off of the comics are the cash register, i.e. the characters names. Everything else is a sloppy job of a story. From experience as a director Raimi should have learned where to develop the story rather than trying to cram ten pounds of sh!t in a five pound bag. My only other disgust with this film is it set records for money making since America is dumb and naive enough to sit and watch this crap. Way to go Raimi, Marvel and America!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The character of Sandman was also good and had great moments and depth to him. Peter's struggles with Harry and Eddie Brock were good as well.

Among the hardest to please includes the comic book studs. The comic book fans have different expectations from that of the rest of the mainstream. It is a difficult job to do, but the Spider-Man series at this point had done a fantastic job gratifying everybody. Combining excellent special effects, great acting, a wonderful script, and good direction; the Spider-Man films rank as among the best films based off comic books. Spider-Man 2 stands as the best of them all, even above Batman Begins and Superman. But, with the third installment looming and multiple plots being revealed, it was looking like a movie with a lot of content for something that's just 140 minutes.This is pretty much what makes and breaks Spider-Man 3; the sheer amount of things going on. Packing in way too much when it easily could convert into two films, Spider-Man 3 disappoints mildly because of lack of consistent pacing, lack of development, and lack of direction. The special effects and the musical score also takes a step backwards. Spider-Man 3 is a lot of fun and at times hilarious and jaw-dropping, but at other moments just misses the mark. The potential was there, it had the opportunity to be the best superhero film in existence, but with everyone having to share screen time, nobody besides Spider-Man actually got much time to present their capabilities (in terms of character and the acting). The list of underused characters is astounding; from Harry to Sandman, to J. Jameson, to most unfortunately, Venom.Spider-Man 3 takes place right after part 2, in which Peter Parker and Spider-Man are enjoying a new life of acceptance, success, and happiness. In the meantime, the new girlfriend MJ isn't getting the breaks in terms of her career. Things take a turn for the worse when ex-friend Harry tries to kill Peter in honor of his father, when an escaped convict accidentally gets superpowers, when a meteorite lands on Earth with a mysterious substance, and there is a new photography rival in Parker's newspaper. Despite the plot taking a few twists and turns, this movie is mostly drama. We still don't have the smart-aleck one-liners and laid-back attitude of Peter from the comic books, even though it seems like all the humor in the franchise has and will only come from Bruce Campbell (in another great cameo) and J. Simmons (underused, but scene-stealing). The writing is decent, but still has its moments of bad dialogue and somewhat unnecessary moments.The acting isn't that bad, especially when compared to other superhero flicks, it gets the job done. Topher Grace is the big surprise as he pulls off a surprisingly decent performance as Venom, while the rising star Thomas Haden Church does a superb job as a broken escape convict-turned supervillian Sandman. James Franco is the best among the main characters however playing the confused, angry, and sometimes charming (when happy) Harry. The special effects, as stated before, wasn't as good the third time around because it was rather overused in multiple instances. It does not help that the Oscar-winning special effects team behind the second installment did not make a return. The pacing however is really what hurts the movie the most. With so much to tell in so little time, the pacing goes rather fast for a Spider-Man movie, and then it leads to nobody but Spider-Man going through changes in front of the audience. The villains, while potentially horrifically menacing, pale in comparison to the enemies in the first two simply because they weren't in the movie much at all. Venom, the most-hyped portion of Spider-Man 3, gets very little screen time when he could easily have been a deadly force to reckon with.By the time the final act rolls around, the setbacks of the movie become very clear. Spider-Man 3 tried to add so much, tried to pack such a heavy punch, that we get a rather anti-climactic final battle, and an anti-climatic ending. The final sequence, despite being rather truthful to the comic books, still somewhat feels rushed and does not deliver as much as the previous battles throughout the movie. Instead of being a wild ride final chapter, we get a heavy dosage of melodrama. Yes, the Spider-Man films are about character and the emotions they go through more so than the action, but this time it was taken a bit too far. The chemistry between Parker and MJ wasn't as strong this time, as it was spent mostly bickering. So what happened? They tried pleasing everybody, from the comic book buffs to the action buffs to the fans of the previous installments. The end result is a rather mixed bag with its fun scenes and battles, but boy could it have been something else.Bottom Line: The third installment is not as good as the previous two, but still has plenty of good moments and some incredible action. However, trying to build so much, trying to tell so many stories and introduce so many characters, the plot feels rather tangled. They failed to build upon the villains, and we don't get to see them develop into the monsters they become like before. Worst of all, Venom, a character that could have really stolen the show and added horror and suspense to the picture, becomes nothing more than almost a mere cameo. The Spider-Man franchise isn't ready to give up, but perhaps its time to pass the directing and writing baton to others who might be able to give the trilogy a little face lift. They seem to have lost the way with this franchise, and perhaps with a new cast they can steer it in the right direction. Don't come into this movie expecting brilliance, but rather a decent popcorn flick with its flawsin other words, the typical popcorn flick.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

That would seem like an endearing quality if this was a coming-of-age movie about the sand-in-the-face nerd finally overcoming bullies and low self-esteem to win the girl of his dreams, but it's not so wonderful or interesting in a superhero movie.Sure, Spidey DOES have low self-esteem, and sure, Peter Parker IS a nerdy little twit, but he's no weakling - that ship has long since sailed. Now, Spider-Man is the hero of children across the city, so there's less reason to empathize with him, to identify our own uncoolness within Parker.The problems with this movie are manifold. To begin with, the webslinger has far too many bad guys to face. First, there's the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), an escaped convict who fell into a particle accelerator and now has the properties of, well, sand. Then there's an alien parasite, conveniently falling from the sky so it can latch onto Peter and bring out the worst in his repressed personality. Then there's Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a supremely vicious rival photographer. Oh, and Harry Osborn (James Franco), the son of the Green Goblin; he thinks Spidey killed his pop (he didn't), and he knows Peter is Spidey (oops). So you can imagine what's on Harry's mind.With all of these villains, you'd think there'd be plenty of conflict. Clearly, however, the writers felt something else was needed, so they invented a highly contrived plot thread in which Peter (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane's (Kirsten Dunst) relationship disintegrates. It should be no surprise to you whatsoever that somehow this relationship gets resuscitated by movie's end. They're together! They're apart! They hate each other! They love each other! You'll hate them both! And what bugs me more than the obviousness, the sheer craptastic predictability of the relationship angle, is that both MJ and Peter act like completely selfish, rotten jerks to each other - and we're supposed to eat that up. Apparently, we're supposed to think, ""Hey, yeah, that's exactly how it is!"" Supporters of the movie might point to the fact that Peter's under Venom's control when he's treating MJ like garbage, but that's not true - he's a creep to her well before Venom shows up. He's smug, self-centered, clearly soaking up the adoration of the city like he was Donald Trump handing out low-income housing in Brooklyn. Okay, maybe not that smug, but still. Peter Parker, in this movie, behaves exactly opposite from what makes Peter Parker interesting to the rest of us in the first place - that he is an insecure dweeb who happens to have superpowers. A crass, smarmy punk is not appealing.There's one telling scene - it was in the trailer, too - that shows Peter strutting down the street, wearing the Venom costume under his normal clothes, and every girl stops to stare at this supposed virile paragon of masculinity. Yeah, Peter Parker. The problem is that Tobey Maguire isn't much of an actor, and when he has to stray from the golly-gee innocent-lamb of Peter Parker, his inabilities are completely exposed. In short, he sucks ass. He can't carry a scene without putting on a mask and looking like he's swinging on some web-like substance. The casting of Maguire made sense originally, because he looks exactly like the kind of doofus nitwit you'd expect Peter Parker to be, but in this movie, when he has to be more than just that doofus, Maguire can't hack it.Speaking of looking like he's swinging .... isn't the whole purpose of CGI to make awesome things look real? Remember back in the day when actors would be in a car, appearing to drive through a city, when it was obvious they were on a set with the city scene playing in the background? I mean, on the cheaper films, it was pretty clear what was going on. The CGI in this movie is a lot like that. When Spider-Man is swinging between buildings, it looks like they took Maguire jumping around and plopped it onto a city background. It looks terrible, and it's distracting.So, let's recap. Too many villains (they should have stuck with Sandman and Harry), a shallow, ridiculous relationship, poor special effects, and bad acting, at least on Maguire's part. But hey, I can't blame him entirely - Sam Raimi's script turns Spider-Man into Emo Spidey - complete with stereotypical Goth haircut and dull monotone! And who knew that simply wearing the Venom costume could make one an accomplished jazz pianist and dancer? With all of these obvious inadequacies, you'd think that the door would finally be closed on this series, but since the movie did well, you can bet a S-M 4 will pollute the theaters sooner rather than later.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The first one introduced us to the lovable Peter Parker and alter ego Spider-man superbly, brilliantly capturing the normalcy and rather uninspiring life of Peter Parker before his dramatic transformation, this being one of the chief reasons for the comic books' widespread appeal. The second movie went that stage further: more action; more humour; a fantastically portrayed Doc Ock (who's excellent CGI made for some breathtaking action sequences) and a more engaging plot. The internal battle within Peter was the most wonderful thing about the second movie, where he came to understand that the right thing is not always the easiest, but it is his responsibility to still follow the right course, whatever the personal sacrifice.As a consequence of these two brilliant forerunners, there was huge anticipation for this third installment. The question is: has it delivered? The answer is not a simple one. In many ways it does deliver and in some it doesn't. The idea of internal struggle which made the second film so compelling has been employed again here, where the mysterious symbiote causes adverse changes to Peter's character. Just as in the second film, we can again relate to the idea of a darker side to our character; which thankfully most of us choose to subdue. Whatever people may say about the third movie exhibiting too many villains and multiple story lines, there is one thing that cannot be denied: the black suited Spider-man has been adapted down to a tee. The darkening of Peter's character and the power the new suit brings, with the personal difficulties Peter is experiencing and the emergence of Sandman, truly makes for an engaging storyline with some truly hilarious moments mixed in. The friendship of Peter and Harry Osborn (Green Goblin) is put through the ringer again in this movie, where Harry, all kitted out in his new Goblin gear, seeks revenge for the supposed murder of his father. The strength of these two estranged friends' relationship is shown, making for a climactic but in truth, rather disappointing final scene, although this is more down to the rather uninspiring Venom than anything relating to Harry. Indeed, the Harry-Peter storyline is quite simply excellent. The character of Sandman, although having a rather clichéd misunderstood I'm a good guy really back-story, is done well, and helps to bring closure finally to the Uncle Ben saga.Unfortunately, there are problems, relating particularly to one single character. The main criticism of the this movie is quite simply that the character of Venom, who in the comic book is considered Spider-mans' greatest enemy, indeed his arch-enemy, who possesses all the same powers but is quite simply better, is portrayed exceptionally poorly on screen. As the villain and character everyone was so excited to see, Venom is a total disappointment. Not only is he given very little screen time, but the character development is lacklustre, the motivations for his intense hatred of Spider-man, though shown, are uninspired, and the taunting and general attitude of the comic book character has been wholly bi-passed, to allow time for Sandman and the Green Goblin. I therefore have to agree with critics who say that there are too many villains. Venom is such a complex, rich and above all significant character, as he essentially represents the darker side of Spider-mans' character that he has dispelled when ridding himself of the symbiote, that the attention paid to him in this film is totally unsatisfactory. I would have far preferred to see the emergence of Venom at the very end of the film, ready for a fourth installment. It almost seems as though Sam Raimi felt as though it was his last chance and the demand for Venom from the fans was too great so he simply decided to cram as much in as possible. In the end, one thing apparently failed to register: less can sometimes be more.For a film which is primarily concerned with revenge and forgiveness (for Uncle Ben's murder, for Norman Osborn's, for Peter's spat with Mary-Jane and vice versa), it succeeds. However, the rather disappointing end and the ease with which the crucial character of Venom is defeated, leaves a rather sour taste in the mouth as you get up from your seat and exit the movie theatre.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

After and exciting initiator (with an unforgettable kiss) and a magnificent second installment, the chance to see a total crap and a drain on one's resources was really plausible. And, on the contrary, it isn't so: there are many flaws, but the film is very agreeable. The figures of Eddie Brock, funny swine, and of Gwen Stacy, a bit silly goose and rival of the mythic Mary Jane, are only touched (but they'd deserve a considerable investigation), whereas Flint Marko/Sandman is rather unlikely. Peter Parker's dark side is not so dark, and the risk to have an headache after the screening is quite high. But sometimes it's therapeutic dreaming in the dark of a movie theater with a popcorn bowl by the hands: cinema is also this.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But compared to the previous installments, it just doesn't have that extra something that made the other ones great. Maybe it was too much talking not enough action. Adding some drama is great, especially when the drama is backstabbing and betrayal, but there wasn't a great action scene. The first had the great Parade and bridge scene, the second had the train scene, the bank scene (which still gives me chills seeing an old woman falling off a building only to be saved seconds before) and the final dock scene. Compared to these, the Harry vs. Peter scene and the construction sight just don't cut it. And just like the second, there is a scene of awkward walking and facial expressions that is just unbearable. This is a good movie no doubt, but it leaves us dangling for a 4th installment.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There will always be things in comic book sources that don't really function or translate well onto screen, and vice-versa. Without a doubt, the Spider-Man film franchise, as well as the new Batman franchise and X-Men trilogy, are the greatest comic book films ever. V for Vendetta, 300, and Sin City don't count as they were based on graphic novels, not comic books. Yes there is a difference. But let's talk Spider-Man 3.As mentioned before, Spider-Man 3 is not perfect. There are parts that don't feel like they really advance the story or simply don't flow very well. The major flaw of Spider-Man 3 is it's attempt to do too many things at once. There are three villains, Harry Osborn, Sandman, and Venom. Additionally, there is of course the love story, which now is back to a love triangle involving Peter, Mary Jane, and Harry. ALSO, Spider-Man must deal with the power-responsibility catch after acquiring his new black suit, compliments of a symbiote from space, AND, Peter has a new potential love interest, Gwen Stacy. Phew...talk about a lot of ground to cover.Whereas in most comic book films, the story will cover the hero, or heroes' struggles with identity and purpose, they only focus on one to two villains at a time. But Spider-Man 3 gives us three, and in some ways four, noting on how Spidey becomes somewhat of an arse after getting the black suit. This causes the story to become so divided as the creative teams attempts to give each story an equal amount of screen time, that they become very shallow and not deep enough to touch on the human side that the other two films, specifically the flawless second installment, really connected on.But even with it's big flaw of being bloated, Spider-Man 3 does have many great things going for it that show why the web-slinger's outings have always been simply great. First and foremost, the film doesn't take itself too seriously, though there are a lot of tears shed. It remains one of the most fun experiences you will have watching a movie. I would highly advise seeing it on the big screen, because like the first two installments, as well as other epics, it just doesn't translate into a TV as well. The visual effects in this latest film do the impossible and top the second one. The action is simply fantastic and will not leave viewers disappointed. Also, fans will love the designs on Venom and the more hardcore fans will be drooling over the simply amazing visuals on both Venom, Sandman, and pretty much the whole movie.All in all, Spider-Man 3 is one hell of a way to start the summer movie season of 2007, one that promise to bring in a whole plethora f fantastic movies to come. Also, it's a great way to conclude the current trilogy.8.9/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The hype, trailers and build-up had this destined to be the #1 film of the summer (and it probably will be to be honest). A sign of Toby Maguire putting on a few pounds probably means he's had enough of the Spider-Man series, and there probably won't be anymore.However...The film starts with Peter Parker loving his ""claim-to-fame"" as Spidey - he swallows his pride and forgets that Mary Jane is also part of his life. A fantastic battle scene within the opening shows the quality of the special effects put into this 3rd film. They really have outdone themselves in this Spidey, but the lack of story and depth to characters showed.It seemed as though they decided to fill in comic moments to tie up loose ends in the film, which weren't really that funny anyway. I guess this was to make-up for the ridiculous sub-plots and storyline. There are three baddies in this one, and in my opinion, it just slaughtered the films structure, and weighing in at 2 and a half hours, it seemed to drag on abit. I do have a soft spot for Jameson though, his attitude and timing are perfect. Really great moments with him! Venom should of been the baddest, coolest, evilest S.O.B. that Spidey had to face, but the feeble attempt from Topher Grace as Venom (and I mean feeble in the highest degree), just made me cringe. His acting was absolutely shocking, and he just did not suit the Venom role what-so-ever. This brings me on to the ""cheese"" factor of the film. You could actually of had crackers with this film. The cheesy dialogue, acting and stupid Jazz Bar scene was ludicrously stupid and had no meaning what so ever. (Watch it and see what I mean).Sandman (played by Thomas Haden Church), did a poor job of portraying a man-on-the-run - his dull tone put me off and made me want to fall asleep. Only when he became the actual Sandman (which the effects were amazing I have to say - they really did capture the villain as Sandman perfectly!) he felt comfortable and gave a good performance.The effects really did save this film, and for the money they spent on it, really does show. The story isn't anything to be desired, and the crap acting from most of the cast sparked off some of the cheesiest moments in cinema history.I walked away from this movie thinking how much I wanted to love it, but I just couldn't. It was a big let down. Spider-Man 2 completely washed this film away. Save it for a DVD watching, or if you have to see it, go watch this with an open-mind. Its not as good as the second Spidey, but the action sequences are stunning. Period. Don't get your hopes up.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Before it's worldwide release, the IMDb rating was over 8! I was looking forward to being very pleased with this third installment.However, I came out of the theatre somewhat disappointed. Don't get me wrong - it is a great movie, immensely entertaining, packed with awesome special effects and ridiculously funny. So funny in fact, that even some of the scenes that were supposed to be sentimental or serious ended up with laughs. I'm sure I am not the only one who thinks that Tobey Maguire doesn't have the best 'crying' face, as the audience busted out laughing every time he did. Poor Tobey. He should have been directed more gracefully during those times.Another reason I was so excited for SM3 was the introduction of Gwen Stacy, who was Peter's girlfriend in the comic books. Plus she was being portrayed by the absolutely talented Bryce Dallas Howard! I wish she had a larger role in this, but perhaps they saved that for the fourth film? There are too many stories meshed into this film. The murder of Peter's Uncle explained, Sandman, Eddie Brock and Venom, Peter and Mary Jane's relationship on the rocks - all in all not as good character development than the second film, which I still consider to be the best as a whole. Some say you must read the comic book to appreciate how perfectly it was adapted, but films and graphic novels are entirely different mediums. I do think Raimi did this the best it could be done.OVERALL - I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and I think to come in not expecting anything would have been a better experience for me. Worth seeing in the theatre, especially hearing all the comments the audience makes - Peter's hair when he wears the symbiote, the dancing, Harry back to normal - you know what I'm talking about. I'll be looking forward to the DVD release. 7/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

However much of the script, or 'moralising', isn't a lot worse than in the first 2 films - people making such negative comments seem to have either got bored of the tone of the films, or for some reason have come to expect the script to be some great work of literature rather than the comic book adaptation which it essentially is.The special effects are very good, though some of the 'chase' action sequences are slightly hard to follow. There are too many plot lines but it is not a complete mess. Again this is a comic book adaptation and I don't think it would be in the film's best interests to attempt to fully and 'logically' explain everything that happens.That said I did find the film a little disappointing after the first two and think the series has run its course. Unless a new director can do something truly unexpected I think this should be the final film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Helas, the movie fails to archive its pretensions on one level, that's certainly the most important : if the special effects are beautiful (the birth of Sandman is indeed a wonderful humanistic use of informatics), the lack of coherence of the movie is so obvious, that it ruins the pleasure you take to the pyrothechique spectacle.The first two adaptations of the comics were frozen in a bi-polar structure, that divides the movie in a first enjoyable part that shows Peter Parker's daily life and problems, and a more conventional second part, were Spider-Man fights a villain (Green Goblin or Octopus). The first good surprise of this third part is that this boring structure explodes right away, villains comes out of nowhere every five minutes, sentimental and heroically life are stuck together, the situations always change : you really have the impression read a gigantic trade paperback of the Spider-Man adventures. But the bad news is that, after a few time, it really gives a incoherence feeling, and the impression that the plot goes in every direction at the same time becomes more and more important. The situations look illogical, as well as the character's choices. And the density and the variety of the plot rapidly becomes complication and exaggeration. You soon loose the feeling to read a TPB, but a digest of all the Spider-Man stories in years.And the incoherences doesn't only concern the narrative structure of the movie, its tone, as well as Sam Raimi's adaptation choices suffer from this lack of coherence. If the naive and lighten atmosphere particularly fits to the teenage tone of the first movies, the naivety of the characters and of the situations, when it comes to an adult life, to marriage and to work questions, is rather ridiculous ! And the same critic goes for the narrative and visual style of the movie. Since the beginning of the saga, Sam Raimi chooses to adapt the comic-books of the 70's, with its ridiculous villains and its lighten tone. But when it comes to the symbiot arc, and particularly to Venom, the style has to become darker and graver. And the least we can say is that the all thing unfortunately stays as unreal, incredible and immature as in the rest, even if it's now impossible to hide the incoherences of the movie behind the argument of a 70's style adaptation.When the first movie made me dreamed of a dramatic crescendo, the third only offers a well done pop corn movie, and is in the end as disappointing as the last stand of the X-men.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The first two movies did a great job of conveying the spirit of Spiderman, whilst taking liberties with certain characters and story elements. I let things slide because the movies looked great, were cast well and well... it's Spiderman!! So it goes without saying, even though I am about to say it, that I was supremely looking forward to seeing Spidey again. The character of Venom was one I liked from before. Not that I liked the guy, I just liked the transition, the Black suit, Eddie Brock etc... But in Spidey 3, I just wasn't buying it. A meteor ""conveniently"" lands near where Peter and Mary-Jane are making out and making me throw up (a huge element that also bugged me about this movie, I'll get to that). Something black crawls out of the tiny meteor and attaches itself to Peters bike back to Peters' apartment... then it does nothing for like 45 minutes... what was it doing? Messing with the door knob? So eventually we get the Black Spiderman, but do we? What does he do as Black Spiderman that makes him so mean? Break a camera and wet some sand? Ooooooh he's so mean. Most of ""black"" spidey isn't black spidey at all, it's black Peter Parker. All floppy hair and unnecessary dancing. So I was holding out hope for ""Venom"" or as he's know in the movie Topher Grace with bad teeth It almost seemed to me that they were rushed post production and because if I was disappointed with Black Spiderman, I was disgusted by Venom, sorry, Bad Teeth Topher. Don't get me wrong I like Topher Grace a lot, I just don't think he was right for this role Especially given the fact that it was so poorly executed. They should have introduced Eddie Brock in the second movie, given that rage time to simmer, make him more likely to wanna see Parker dead over a period of time rather than a couple of days. The movie should have revolved around Spiderman, the Black Suit and Venom. Not Peter Parker and Mary-Jane, come on!!! Who cares?! We wanna see mind blowing special effects here, killer action with carefully thought out character building. They had enough time to put it all in but they put way too much into making us wish Mary-Jane would fall out of that cab. We got BTT (Venom) for the last 10 minutes but 90% we saw Eddie Brocks face, why? We know who it is.*Possible spoiler* One more gripe (that I'll mention here anyway), what was the butler waiting for to share that little chestnut with Harry? An invite from the Queen? I hate when they throw convenient things into movies to help move the plot, really gets my goat! *Possible spoiler ends*What did I like? I like the crane sequence. I liked Thomas Hayden Church as Sandman and the character of Sandman as a whole. He was portrayed well but didn't need to be in this movie, which is unfortunate. I like the special effects overall although some of the action was too close up and I could hardly tell what was happening.Oh wait, ONE MORE GRIPE!! What the hell happened to Spiderman's ""Spidey Sense""? A lot of what happens in this movie could have been avoided if he had remembered to turn it on. Oh wait it's always on? And even Eddie Brock knew about it? Hmm now that is odd?I gave Spiderman 3 a 6, but that may go down after writing this Oh dear","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

However after i let the whole film sink in and i have become annoyed. This film is like three Spiderman films rolled into one. Despite the film's 2.5 hour runtime, there is no room allotted for character development. Venom receives less time then most other characters and he was supposedly the headline-enemy of the film. What happened? were they pushing the limits of the 250, 000, 000 budget? probably. There were also the scenes involving Parker and MJ that were painful to watch. Watching Toby try to squeeze out those tears look like squeezing a sponge full of water was the nail in the dramatic coffin.The finale whereby the reporter narrates the events is also painstaking. So cliché, so overdone, such unnecessary babbling filler just drives me up the wall. I don't mean to lash out at a sizablen portion of the North American movie going public, but when a high-budget production flashes shiny graphics, extended fight scenes and cheesy acting only rivaled by the Young and the Restless, its enough to be considered a successful movie. Too many people just eat this stuff up. I am no exception at times however i can take the blinders off after the movie and see past the glitz that only shallow viewers will be amazed by. If you want to see multiple movies in one showing, pick-up Grindhouse when it comes to DVD. That's real entertainment that ISN'T ashamed to expose its multiple flaws.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Certainly it was nice to see Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco together again as Peter Parker, Mary Jane Watson, and Harry Osborne. I also liked Thomas Haden Church as The Sandman and Topher Grace as, first, Peter's Bugle photo rival Eddie Brock and then the black Spidey costume-dominated Venom. Hilarious scenes of J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson and Raimi regular Bruce Campbell as a French waiter who greets Peter. Nice turns from Rosemary Harris as Peter's Aunt May and Mageina Tovah as Ursala, the landlord's daughter (I first noticed her as Luke Giradi's first girlfriend, Glynis Figliola, on Joan of Arcadia). Also nice additions of James Cromwell as Captain Stacy and Ron Howard's daughter Bryce Dallas Howard as his daughter Gwen. And Spidey creator Stan Lee says something to Maguire that seems very poignant here. All this and some of the most thrilling scenes provided by Sam Raimi make this one of the most exciting movies of this young summer season. In other words, don't hesitate, just watch it!","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

Surely they must come from pimple-ridden teenagers who were expecting a non-stop assault of special effects and fighting sequences. True, there's plenty of that in SPIDER MAN 3, but for once in my life I couldn't care less about the amazing special effects (top notch work here)because the story truly grabbed me. The conflict inside Peter Parker, the way he transforms into an egotistical maniac, was marvelous. I must confess, it was nice to see spidey taking on his enemies with a vengeful glee, though ultimately this was his undoing. What I really liked about SPIDER MAN 3 was the depth of character of the villains. Unlilke, say, Lex Luthor or The Joker (who are apparently evil since birth for no apparent or explained motive), the villains here end up who they are under very adverse circumstances, like Flint Marko (Sandman). You can't help but to feel sorry for him and this type of villain development is sorely missing in other so called ""action hero"" movies. Like Dr.Doom of the FANTASTIC 4: he appears to be evil over some really meaningless reason that doesn't hold any water!If there's one complaint I have about the whole movie, it doesn't deal with the story nor the acting nor the superb special FX: it's about the music. Danny Elfman, who's made countless of memorable scores (BATMAN, SIMPSONS), he just can't seem to make a truly memorable score for the SPIDER MAN franchise. Forget the grandiose score of a SUPERMAN, or STAR WARS, or even his fabulous BATMAN score. The music, while still great, is far from memorable.Sam Raimi has treated the SPIDER MAN movies with respect and you can see there's a work of love involved. If some of you out there prefer the ""other"" mindless action hero movies out there, be my guest. For my money, I truly enjoyed the the 2 hours plus ride of SPIDER MAN 3! 10* out of 10*!","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

Spiderman 2 was the only acceptable movie of the trilogy, it had a lot of JJJ, least of Tobey playing his dumb scenes of Peter Parker (instead of just being a shy, rational guy), and a good villain (in fact villains were the overall positive things of the trilogy), Spider2 just lacked on action, it just should have had more, it made the movie a little boring. Now some things about spider 3. 1st, Peter Parker, that wasn't Parker, was the usually dumb Tobey. Damn, even the characters of SandMan and Venom were better than I expected, but this actor, Tobey was at his worst, more than ever. He stands behind the crowd without the mask =| He fights without the mask, he does that donkey face and starts to dance...he made me sick with just 2minutes of the movie start. His spider sense was OFF, and he gets more beat than superman and still stays OK, I don't get it. I think MJ was really OK, it's hard to do better when we're not physically similar to the BD MJ. JJJ is GOLD but was deeply underrated on the this movie. Harry...well Harry is bad, at least cut your hair man! To be a bit similar to the real harry, at least physically. Topher Grace (Brock/Venom) and Thomas Church (Sandman/FlintMarko) were OK, I really think sandman was more than OK, he succeed in to pass that feeling about family he has at BD. I'll not bother you more, just mention some things like: Venom should appeared more and be bigger than spider, that would make bigger impact, Goblin's pumpkin makes a scar to harry but kills venom, wow; And that's it, sorry my bad English, I'm Portuguese.

I have been keeping in touch with the development of the movie, seen all the trailers, but when I saw the film, it seemed less exciting than what the trailers seem to promise. I remember watching the trailers for Spider-man 2, and when the film reeled out I was blown away. Somehow this blown away feeling did not exist for Spidey's third outing. Something was missing. It is strange because the film had more funny moments, sad moments, villains, beautiful women, action scenes and it seemed to focus more on the side shows, but that tried to steal the heart of the film....Spider-man! I mean, where was he? I did not get to see enough of him in this film. I remember in Spider-man two within the first 5 minutes we see him flying around delivering pizza and saving kids on the street. This film by itself is a much serious version of the lighter, snappier prequels we have been treated to. So when the film makers decided to make a difference with this film, somehow it was not what the viewers were expecting. If there was no Spider-man, and Spider-man 2 films to compare with, this film would have been excellent. It is not a kid's film, for sure. I had many questions as to why Spidey behaved the way he did even before the changes in him took place.....too many questions in the film were left unanswered, a few scenes were kind of hurried, some scenes did not make sense. Also because there were many characters in the film, each scene was too short to be remembered. Overall, this is a good film, but does not live up to the built-up hype. Looking forward to a better Spider-man 4!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I enjoyed watching this movie similar to riding a roller coaster, you are not sorry you did it, but you are not sure you would do it more then once.Now, let me add that as a girl who happens to action films, the fight scenes were amazing. The only parts that got to be a bit tedious were some of the interactions between the characters. Some of these scenes were necessary, some were not.The acting was pretty top notch, the special effects were fabulous.For me the worse part was the senseless way to end it- If you have seen it you know what I am talking about. I saw strong potential for a storyline that could have gone somewhere...But never mind. Watch the movie, just come to the theater expecting what you'll get- a bit of sappy romance, a bit of corny lines, some great action fight scenes...and you wont be sorry","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Movies like that give excuse to illegal downloading. For God sake what else are we gonna watch? Comic movies are becoming more and more boring (with bright exceptions Frank Miller's novels where at least the plot FOLLOWS the comic story!). This Spiderman is nothing else than a complete disappointment. The cherry on the cake was the appearance under the American flag.Do I have to watch such a cheap propaganda? this film shows New-yorkers like total jerks, converts them to characters. a cheering mass away for any sense of danger. This is a movie with a totally stupid spider-man, with only one respectful character, yes the sand man. And finally the complete stupid: ""I forgive you"". Seems that any movie those days has a meaning, a deep one to be honest. And yes, lots of CG. But unfortunately, this is not cinematography. especially after last month's ""300"". Turn back to read the comics or even the animated series. This is a rip-off spider-man...","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

""Spider-Man 3"" is the best in the film trilogy right now! It's the most emotionally gripping. Tobey Maguire gives a stellar performance this time around, as with all of the cast, including newcomers Topher Grace, Bryce Dallas Howard (Favorite of mine) and Thomas Haden Church. Go see this movie! You will love it as much as I did!","17 out of 32 found this helpful.

Although if I didn't know the comic book storyline, I would think the story is well produced...The third story even worse, by entering Gwen Stacy character which supposed to be Peter Parker's high school sweetheart, and uncovering uncle Ben's murder mystery like that... Agreed with scott's review, that the movie has too many villains to deal with and the problem Spidey facing is just too much... although as Mary Jane told Peter, ""Even Spiderman needs help sometime..."", but the help he receive in this movie in my opinion is only for dramatical reason...Great visualization of Venom, although for Spidey black suit, i prefer the suit to stand on its own instead of blending in with the original suit. The suit should be just plain black without the web outline, it will make spidey meaner... And the point of having the suit blend in with Peter's attitude, is to make him more rough and violent, not make him looks stupid...Many people complaint about Peter Parker crying too much in this movie, but I think that's OK, since Spiderman is human after all...Over all, good work for the whole cast and crew, even the writer, but hopefully in the next movie, we can get a clearer picture of what happening, not just scattered picture on how great Spidey is...","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

All the while New York faces two new villains - the Sandman and Venom. And Harry Osbourne has yet to settle his score with Spider Man.The first two films were terrific hero stories with a feel good comic book twist. In addition to their spectacular action sequences. The trailer for this film looks like a continuation of just that, but sadly the film proves to be something different.There are many story lines and none of them receives the attention they merit. Prime example being the Sandman character who was a simple crook stealing money for his family before being mutated. There is a scene where he visits his family, but that is all we see of them and from then on he is merely an on-screen menace. The other villain, Venom, appears so late in the movie that he is barely developed as a villain and ends up being another merely another menace for Spider Man. If that isn't enough, then the remaining storyline - between Harry, Peter, and Mary Jane - receives such ridiculous melodramatic treatment that is is practically and insult to the last two films. It is not wholly bad and plays as a cheesy comic book story, but given the fact it follows the previous two films' much stronger and effective stories it is just above sheer disappointment.On the bright side, the action sequences and effects are some of the best around with Spider Man performing some spectacular heroic rescues. The Sandman is also an impressive creation and has a stunning creation scene. And Bruce Campbell gives what may be one of the best cameo appearances ever. However, a few good action/special effects scenes have never earned a movie big points. --- 6/10Rated PG-13 for violence","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I have been a loyal Spiderman fan through the 80s and 90s when I was growing up, and have been fervently awaiting the third installment for over two years. Some of my favorite movies are the Evil Dead trilogy and Darkman, so I also have nothing but respect for Raimi. So what I say in this review comes with a heavy heart.There are two types of people who will see this movie, people who know the story (me), and people who don't (my wife). Both will be disappointed. Now, the movie is not really that bad, but in comparison to Raimi's the first two outings with the Spiderman franchise, this movie reeks of other franchises past failures at a third installment (for those that don't know, see Superman 3 and TMNT 3 for perfect examples.) At first glance, it's tough to see why this movie doesn't work. The special effects were incredible, the direction was top-notch, even the acting was pretty darn good, for a comic book film. But the story suffered from too many characters. The main focus in on Peter's internal struggle with a creature from space which essentially turns him evil. Great idea for a story, it's easily the biggest of Spiderman's comic book arc, besides the Green Goblin/Gwen Stacy story, and it's chock full of emotion. But the characters who play into it have no characterization, the audience gets no feeling from them. First, the goo. I know all the stories of it, both comics and cartoons, however, there is nothing in the movie to explain it, so non-comic book fans have no idea what or where this stuff comes from, or what it does to Peter. James Franco's character, Harry, does enough 180s to make even a figure skater nauseous (or maybe that was his acting), while Thomas Hayden Church, who plays Sandman, arguably the best actor in the film, has almost zero characterization and plot, despite having the most special effects. Due to this, all the extremely pivotal plot line events and scenes in the film feel weak, unemotional for the audience, and down-right cheesy (even if you leave out the 15 minute long homage to Saturday Night Fever). The other character, Eddie Brock/Venom, played by Topher Grace, feels like such a farce. His motivation for hating Peter Parker is a stretch of the imagination so big that it's glaringly obvious, even in a movie with unexplained black alien goo. This movie left so much of the story unexplained it is highly confusing, unless you know the story going into it. So, sadly to say, this movie was created with solely fans in mind, and even they, due to how poorly characters are handled, walk away feeling disillusioned and disappointed. This movie has everything, except feelings.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I loved the animated series when I was younger and I loved both of the previous movies. Spider-Man 2 is still the best comic movie ever made. So naturally, when I came to watch the midnight showing of Spider-Man 3 I was expecting to see the best super hero movie of all time. Three villains, the black suit, and more action. How could they screw this up? Well, somehow they managed and I left the theater that night very disappointed. Here is a layout of the things I think they did right and the things I think they did wrong.First the right....1. The action sequences were f*cking awesome. The best part of the movie was naturally the action sequences. CGI continues to amaze me.2. Harry didn't wear the Green Goblin mask from the first movie. This was my only gripe about either of the first two films. It looks like a retarded Power Ranger mask.3. They added more humor. The scene with Bruce Campbell was hilarious. The humor kept the movie from being really boring. I'm not including the piano playing or shooting from the hip scene because they were retarded.4. Venom was in the movie and he looked sweet as hell.5. Harry became a good guy at the end. I liked this part. At least Peter didn't have to kill his best friend.The Bad....1. Did Marry Jane really have to sing twice and when did she become so damn whiny? nuff said2.When did spider-man become a long boring chick flick? Seriously, this movie seemed to drag on forever. They would follow up each interesting scene with a bunch of long drug out crap. Like MJ singing or Peter walking around town winking or an arguing scene. They spent more time developing how jealous MJ was of Peter and the love triangle between Peter, MJ, and Gwen then they did developing the characters of the villains. The Gwen character really served no purpose in the film. She wasn't really Eddie's girlfriend, he just thought she was. MJ being jealous was also pointless. He's Spider-Man. Get over yourself. With 3 villains it shouldn't have been that difficult to come up with a story line that kept us on the edge of our seats but instead we got a love story.3. They explained NOTHING. What was the black goo? If you weren't a fan of the comic books you have no idea. Doc Connors gave a 25 second explanation and that was it. Other than that, it was just some goo that crashed from the sky. Why could Peter take the black suit on and off but then all of a sudden not be able to get it off and have to use the bell tower? Why did Eddie get spider powers? Fans know why, but no one else does. Why did sandman become sandman? They gave no explanation. Amazing, a two and a half hour movie that I was bored through a lot of that still can't manage to explain the story line.4. Venom was in the movie for a whole 20 minutes and he didn't speak in the first person plural case. When he said ""I want Spider-Man dead"" instead of ""we want spider-man dead"" I was a bit upset. As I mentioned before, he looked really cool and the fight scene was awesome.5. Spider-Man let Sandman just walk away because he was sorry. WHAT?! I know Spider-Man doesn't kill people but he could have at least kicked his ass. Did they run out of money or what?Overall the movie is worth seeing but it's nowhere near the level of the other two films. The movie drags and fails to explain some very key elements but the action scenes, the humor, and the fact that Venom is in the movie are enough to give the movie 6/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But this one is just not working out.I have found three major faults,and a lot of smaller ones that I won't be mentioning,while watching.1)Two words.Tobey McGuire.He's bad.Dear,he's bad.I don't know who ever decided to make him an actor and thought it was a good idea.He does the exact same act for every part he plays.In the first two films,it didn't bug me that much,but now it's a lot more obvious.A lot of actors out there would deserve to play Spiderman.A note:While mentioning actors,a small part for our lovely Mary Jane Watson... Ah,Kirsten Dunst...or shall I maybe say,Claudia?What a wonderful development of a career,isn't it...Starting off staring with Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt,I mean,come on,I repeat,Tom Cruise AND Brad Pitt,carrying on with The Virgin Suicides...Now she's only an inch apart from being a teeny-weeny American sweetheart,like so many are.The only thing that prevents this is that she's good.She really has material.Anyway,back to the subject. 2)The way they tried to squeeze in too many sagas and characters in one film,which makes me think that it's probably Spiderman films no more.It's a two hours movie,why trying to put everything in it at the same time?Work on one and develop it.3)Why does Peter always takes off his mask while fighting?And how do the NYPD can't find out who he is?Come on,they can identify Mary Jane from hundreds of feet above,Peter was there all the time,fighting,for some reason,with his mask OFF,how can they not figure out it's him?It's sillier than the way no one recognises Sailor Moon as Usagi.OK,so I'm taking three starts away.For the minor things,another one.It's 6/10. Better next time.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is obvious that this movie has grand ambitions, it wants to give it all to us.So this movie should be titled Spiderman A Jack of All Trades. We have a love triangle, and a plethora of nasty villains, all rolled up in a nice casing of morality. I left the theater comfortable in knowing that I always have choices that I can make.This isn't a bad movie. However it simply isn't a great movie. You can get good food at the buffet, but there is rarely anything at the buffet that is the best you ever had. The love triangle and conflict isn't terrible, but it isn't especially compelling. The action scenes are fast and furious, but they seem to have little or no closure. Not terrible, but not really satisfying either. I want a roller coaster ride where I say ""wow"", and I never really felt ""wowed"".At least the Peter PArker character is maturing. Finally we are seeing this character come out of his shell, as you would expect the influence of Spiderman to carry over to Peter. Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson character could use a little more assertiveness, that character really hasn't grown very much now through three movies.This movie left me wanting more. The potentiall of this sandman character left me wanting more. What exactly can this guy do and no do? What are his weaknesses? CAn he be killed? I guess the lack of closure here gives us a basis for Spiderman 4.Where are movies heading? There are soma man sequels coming out this summer. Is it simply enough to spend some big bucks on special effects, come up with a few cute lines of dialoge, and not really have much of a story? I guess maybe it is.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I also think that the character of Venom should be introduced into the movie, with a more different way. The film also gives us questions of whether to be a new movie, because Spidey wants to marry Mary Jane. The part I liked in the movie, was there where Sandman hits weakened Spiderman who can't move because of Venom and Harry Osborne/Green Goblin comes to the rescue. I didn't got the change of the killer of Spidey's uncle, because it changed what we knew in the two first movies. Finally I believe the fans of Spiderman should show a little mercy to the director because he has made an excellent job and even if the movie has some problems it's a good show.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This new suit enhances Spiderman's powers and gives him the feeling of confidence and a new attitude. The only problem is that the new suit feeds on evil thoughts and brings out the dark side of Spiderman and makes him aggressive and feel conceited about how great he is as a superhero. Spiderman begins to neglect Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and other friends, and he must choose between the enticing evil power of the suit or the good old Spiderman. Peter must overcome this internal conflict while fighting the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) and Venom (Topher Grace) with super powers that match Spiderman's unique powers.(My Comment) The storyline brings out different emotions of each character and takes us down the road of more than just fighting villains, but gives us the feeling of caring about the characters. The established characters have matured, and we can feel for them. The film has comedy, emotions, and of course action between good and evil. What else do you need in a movie? We get to see the darker side of Spiderman and the fun side as well. Spiderman has two brand new enemies to fight and the special effects are spectacular. For a long movie, time does fly and the movie is over before you know it. Church's performance as the Sandman was excellent. The movie has funny moments and sad moments where you may even shed a tear. Please, don't over analyze the story or compare it to the first two as some people are doing, because the film was meant to entertain the audience, and it does. Sit back and enjoy the thrilling action packed sequences of Spiderman 3. (Columbia Pictures, Run time 2:20, Rated PG-13)(10/10)","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

MJ doesn't sing she acts, spidey hasn't whipped out any sarcastic comments, since when does harry reconcile with peter? and venom did not have enough... well venom. However, realistically one cannot and must not judge from a comic book perspective, since it is not an adaptation of the comic, but inspired.I know the typical let downs in the film as a sequel. Too long, stories banged heads, comedy was a bit too cheesy, tobey could not pull off a 'bad' and 'mean' spidey, venom only appeared at the end, Kirsten lacked and looked bored, confusion with sandman, brock not well done by topher and so on and so forth. However this is not the case.As entertainment value the sequel had a couple of very nice action scenes, and in my opinion all the characters stepped it up a notch, all except for tobey, to no fault of his own since the script simply lacked punch. It's a shame venom was introduced so late and they should have dedicated an entire film since the beauty of venom is that he HAUNTS spidey not beats the crap out of him. That said, I think topher stole the film. He was exactly what he was told to be and did his part extremely well! Osbourn also improved, even though the story line clashed a bit and it ended slightly twisted, but the whole amnesia arc worked well. Aunt may was definitely better and sand man was incredible. MJ was weak, and through out the entire three films has been weak, but there was a slight improvement in the character, more of the mary jane comic fans are used to. Sand man being portrayed as good works well in the comic book world since as such he is good and eventually changes sides so no real complaint there.With all the hype it is understandable that fans were let down, but in the end it was a good and fun film and some comedic timing was very good. Even though most laughs came from peter crying on the bridge.The final draw back was that there was a bit too much emotion. The final scene/s were a bit too much and the audience seemed bored of the characters' tears.STILL despite the uproar among fans, it was a good and enjoyable film which I would recommend to anyone","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Better than the first two combined. With that said, the plot is fraught will HUGE plot holes, the acting is atrocious (James Franco & Thomas Haden Church) being the only two watchable actors, and the dialogue was ridiculously bad.The Plot - it really seemed like Sam Raimi was trying to combine 2 movies into one. The fact that he tried to cram so much into such a short amount of time ends up hurting the movie more than anything else. No storyline is developed properly and the audience is left wondering why most of the action is happening.The Acting - I'm a huge Topher Grace fan, but he's a terrible Venom. I'm not entirely sure why he was chosen to be Eddie Brock, maybe because Sam Raimi knew that most of his viewers wouldn't know the comic book version of Eddie Brock, but honestly Toper Grace was just a terrible choice regardless. Kristen Dunst is one of the worst actresses in Hollywood. I don't know why people continue to cast her in movies. Mary Jane Watson is supposed to be a supermodel. Kristen Dunst looks like a horse. Barbaro would've done a better job. Everyone else, however, did a great job.The Dialogue - It was just cheesy and terrible. Like everything else in the movie, it felt rushed and forced.Sadly, this movie will go on to break box office records when it really shouldn't. It tricked me into watching it and I'm sure it'll trick millions of other people. If you MUST see it, wait until the DVD and get a bunch of friends together to make fun of it.

Three villains, a new girl, a walk on the dark side for our hero, not to mention massive action scenes: one thing's for sure, you get your money's worth.OK, so Peter and Mary Jane's relationship is approaching Rhett Butler/Scarlett O'Hara levels in terms of will they, won't they, on/off fickleness. So there's enough characters here for five movies. And Aunt May's given little to do except spout wisdom. And the alien organism just ""happens"" to choose Peter Parker. Heck, these are nit-picks next to what Raimi and his team have delivered here.It's a dark, muscular beast of a movie, and I loved it. My favourite parts were: The Sandman - brilliantly done, especially the magical rebirth sequence (Raimi and Church work wonders here).Gwen Stacy - Howard looks stunning and can act. Oh, and are we really supposed to pity Peter for having to choose between her and...Mary Jane Watson - excellent as always. Kirsten Dunst is a great beauty, but I also liked the identity crisis she goes through; it felt very real to me.The action - jaw-dropping stuff. I thought the Doc Ock fights were terrific in Spidey 2, but these are bigger, longer and nastier. All of them are top notch.I've heard gripes about the length, but I could happily watch these movies all day. Superheroes are really cooking at the moment, but Spider-man remains the best of the lot. Brilliant!","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

First this is a spider-man movie which means it is made to be fun and not so much serious. This is (if you are familiar with Sam Raimi's work) an excellent comedy!!!It's a pure trash movie (just like Army of Darness)it is made with enormous budget and this movie just shows how Sam Raimi is crazy director with a lot of sense of humor and likes to play around with money, lots of money!! Some scenes in this movie shows how much is this in fact made to entertain people with film knowledge and amaze those without it and those people who are not amazed or do not have clear film knowledge are just those kind of people who do not understand Ed Wood's work, in other words soulless people. If you watched Evil Dead trilogy you will see countless similarities in story and or action between two. Just as an example notice how Ash changes during these films and then compare it to Peter changes in this trilogy, in my eyes those changes are almost exactly the same. One of the reasons I'm so impressed with this film is scene at the end of the movie where you see spidey running in front of an America flag as if he does not look like a person wrapped in American flag already. Hilarious!!!And comments of the TV reporters at the climax are absolutely amazing and funny. One thing you can also notice is when Peter as an emo darker enters jazz bar where his girl works you can actually see if not Willem Dafoe then his very convincing lookalike (man behind them when he and his new girl sit at the table) and that was funny. There are a lot of scenes like these in the movie but I don't want to spoil the fun and excitement when you see them because this movie is all about that; funny ester eggs which tells us that Sam Raimi is in fact joking and having a great time doing this movie. Sam Raimi is one of the kings of modern trash and one of the rare who successfully infiltrated Hollywood and by doing that he's bringing old school trash to mainstream audience. Sam Raimi you are my idol !!! Spider-man 3 - 7.5 out of 10 Spider-man 2 - 7 out of 10 Spider-man - 6.5 out of 10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I know that's a bold statement, but beyond a few AMAZING fight scenes, this movie gets extremely hokey and cheezy. I definitely think it was worth the price of admission (IMAX at midnight baby!) but only because of the impressive fight scenes. All filler to this movie was really not very good.I guess what I'm sayin is the last twenty minutes were worth it, but that's about it. They made this a slapstick comedy, and it absolutely did not work. I'm not sure why the critics are raving, because it's really, just really not worth it compared to the other two. Excruciatingly predictable and painfully awkward on numerous occasions.If you're looking for a blockbuster trilogy finisher, this was certainly not what we were all waiting for. Hopefully Pirates can make up for the loss here.It really is tragic.","33 out of 86 found this helpful.

Spider-man 3 was a 2 and a half hour rushed movie. This new villain/rival Eddie Brock came out of nowhere and eagerly wants to step on Peter Parkers toes and become a up coming photographer for the Daily Bugle. Flint Marko A.K.A The Sandman also comes out of the blue as a fugitive on the run and is coinceindentally responsible for Uncle Ben's death. Another thing I didn't like about this movie is that the producers try to add more comedy to this film which the Spider-man element is action,adventure,and some romance. In the past Spider-man is known to make some pretty witty comments. The scene where the black suit takes over Peter Parker personality and he's dancing along the sidewalk could of been left out. That scene in my opinion was so corny and out of place. Mary Jane is confused as ever in this third installment,at first she in love with Peter and when things don't go her way with Peter she look for Harry Osborne for comfort. Didn't they date in the first movie (Mary Jane Watson & Harry Osborne) and it didn't work out? But to be honest I like Peter's personality in the black suit he seem no longer to be a patsy. He's more suave and at the same time an asshole,and this time we didn't see him get over-powered by adversities while wearing the black suit. As the movie continued it was becoming more predictable and I began to enjoy it even less. The first two movies were more in depth of character content and this movie fails to do so. Scenes were jumping back and forth till you got dizzy to the point of losing interest in the whole movie. The lab partner(Gwen Stacy) of Peter Parker could of been left out the movie she didn't serve a purpose except wanting to be a Spider-man groupie. My recommendation the movie didn't live up to its hype and if you could wait till it comes on video that's not a bad idea neither.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The action and those stunning effects can't get any better.And as some already said: Raimi didn't just make an action-movie with superhuman powers, he also shows real-life human issues and weaknesses everyone can relate to - that's what made Spider-Man a character everybody loves.And the origin of Sandman is already a highlight in movie-history.I only gave it 8 out of 10 though, cause I felt a little disappointed by Ramis and Sonys try to deliver messages of patriotic, religious and human values that are too US-American dyed for people from other countries.In Peter's and MJ's park bridge-scene Raimi and the actors accomplished to show real feeling, especially Maguire (I was blown away by his acting), though the final was the opposite, waaaay too sloppy for my kind of taste. But that's the problem when you want to please everybody - you only get 8 out of 10 stars ;) Conclusion: ""Spider-Man 3"" marks the peak of this years movie-entertainment; it would be a crime if not.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Sam Raimi did an excellent job. Yes, it's flawed and rushed towards the end but this movie made me gain total belief in what was happening on screen; it made em laugh (dude, it's Sam Raimi - - it's gonna be campy as hell), it made me care, it held me in suspense and I almost cried (no kidding). I loved it. Never have I felt the need as this to go rush back in and watch a movie again after a first viewing. If you can just forget about the comic book template, lower your expectations, and just lose yourself to the great drama unfolding before you I think you can have a great time.Plus Bruce Campbell's cameo was gold.This was originally going to be shot back to back with a forth movie but no one could decide on the best possible cliffhanger. Were they nuts?! There's a perfect part to stop it at - - and afterwards that's where things get kinda shaky for a bit and then it redeems itself beautifully at the end.This is what I would call a Grade-A popcorn movie to me. Not those soulless blockbusters Hollywood churns out every summer.Then, again, this is just me. But I was really impressed. I mean, the audience and critics are severely mixed - - with the vast majority of folks hating it (you should have heard the comic geeks grumbling during the closing credits).Will it reclaim its 300 million budget? One can only hope. But I highly doubt it unless people are willing to give a toss about the cinematic-version of these characters.And I'll say this again...I could not stop talking about the movie for hours after on end.

Harry Osborn is after him to avenge his father's death. A petty criminal & real killer of Parker's uncle is transformed into Sandman following a freak accident while an alien symbiote brings out Peter's dark side after bonding with him.Directed by Sam Raimi, Spider-Man 3 is marred by numerous things that were never going to work in its favour. Too many subplots, overdose of characters, complex narration, whole lot of plodding, terribly handled character arcs, weak villains, half-assed attempt at humour & too much melodrama definitely account for its downfall but Raimi's inability to balance all the various aspects into one complete whole is what hurt it most for the directed messes up real bad this time.Most of the technical aspects aren't much of an issue but they fail to work in harmony with each other. Set pieces & camera-work is good, Editing is simply horrible for the plot is highly convoluted in its own mess, Visual effects feature more CGI shots than previous films and many of these effects heavy sequences aren't refined enough to hide the artificial elements, and Christopher Young replaces Danny Elfman as the film's composer and even his music, just like other plot elements, is all over the place.Coming to the performances, the cast of Spider-Man 3 comprises of Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, J.K. Simmons & others with Topher Grace, Thomas Haden Church & Bryce Dallas Howard being new additions, and all of them deliver forgettable performances. The character arc itself is poorly written for both the new & returning cast and the actors fail to add any interesting dimension to it. None of the villains are intimidating, including Venom who's given a much too less screen time to leave any impression.On an overall scale, Spider-Man 3 is without a doubt the weakest of the three films and also ranks amongst the worst sequels ever made. The whole movie gives an impression of being shot in a hurried manner during production with both cast & crew having no idea of where it is supposed to be headed, Raimi's direction lacks the energetic vibe that made his previous two features such a fun & enjoyable ride and every single aspect seems to be lost in its own realm for none of these elements come together to provide the much-needed smooth flow to this unnecessarily convoluted mess.P.S. Still better than The Amazing Spider-Man & The Amazing Spider-Man 2!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Some 200 Imageworks animators and 1,000 action artists in total were used to trump the previous two in the visuals department.As for the story, though, there were more subplots meringued together than a single film can eat. With a twinge more fluff whipped in, this could have easily been ""Spider-Man 4,"" too.It's an optical joyride  yay!  and a cerebral discombobulation  ayiyiyi.

Sam Raimi will have none of that, and found a special x-factor from within his own Spidey movie franchise to ensure sustainability. And it worked great.Superior sequels are a tough act to follow, and only a handful managed to survive the fatigue. It's not about putting in better effects, or introducing new and more powerful villains, but rather about the characters whom we have followed through from the previous movies. Here, we continue our journey with Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and Harry Osborn (James Franco), their love hate relationship with one another, and the will they or won't they situations. Having the creative team return (sans Danny Elfman for the score) and the principal cast intact ensured no continuity issues, which have casted a shadow on and doomed many other superhero productions like DC's Superman-Chris Reeves franchise, or the Batman one started by Tim Burton.Instead of relying on fluffy showmanship on the latest progression of how Spidey swings through Manhattan, and the temptation to shift all its grandeur action pieces to top gear, Spider-Man 3 actually had its characters spend much of their time out of costumes. Which is great, except for those impatient to get things going. It allowed for plenty of space for character development, a continuation of the relationship between Peter and Mary Jane, which on the previous movie's final scene, seemed to have an ominous feeling hung overhead.And yes, things are not going well for our couple. One's a public figure behind a mask, getting plenty of adulation from the common man on the street, while the other, still a struggling artiste in a cold unforgiving city. For Peter Parker, he's thrilled to have people celebrate his prowess, and allowed for success to get to his nerdy head. A nerd getting all the attention, certainly puts him a bit out of whack. He hardly listens, and the keyword here is listen (take note, important to sustain relationship lesson abound), to his partner, and becomes emotionally unavailable, especially when she most needs him. And with miscommunication or the lack thereof, jealousy comes in the form of hot blonde bombshell Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), with whom Peter violates a special bond between him and Mary Jane at the heat of the moment (ok, all those who think it's being petty, might want to rethink that again).As a reminder, this is not the comic's Spider-Man. If it is, then Peter won't have organic web-shooters. So don't go all rile about Gwen's introduction at this stage of the franchise. It's her on screen, so celebrate that instead. Although she's a bit role, I thought Bryce Dallas Howard allowed fan boys to salivate at the prospect of having Gwen Stacy feature heavily in possible future movies. If Kirsten Dunst wish to bury her Mary Jane Watson aside, the franchise can definitely move on with Bryce stepping in with her Gwen, even though this time the comic time line will totally go out of sync. But to be fair to Dunst, her Mary Jane almost always have nothing much to do when Spidey's in costume, unless she decides to challenge for scream queen honors. It's again the same old damsel in distress the character finds herself in for a fair bit, and there's certainly a number of times where you can be held hostage, before some smart alec will deduce the reason why.","15 out of 28 found this helpful.

The New Goblin(why not call him Green Goblin 2?)actually did surprise me as to how much I really liked this character. His glider was almost reminiscent of the original goblin glider from his first appearance in the comics. The Sandman FX was just blew me away. The character from the comics was never my favorite, but I really did enjoy how they made him the villain he is. Venom really surprised me how cool and scary they made him.Peter himself is still the everyman. This movie made him change from the geeky nerd from high school to see him grow to become the man he was made to be. It does show how hard it is in life to make yourself always follow the path of the straight and narrow.I think the reason as to why many people seem not to care for this movie, is that they want to see the characters in the movie to be exactly like in the monthly Spider-man books. I myself have been reading him for over 25 yrs, but I think that Sam Rami had done a great job making these characters fresh and stand out for a new generation. I think it is hard to make these characters exactly the same. I think everyone from the small children to senior citizens can go to this movie and enjoy this.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

I really thought this was by far the best out of all the Spiderman movies, and is probably my favorite comic book movie so far(yes, even better than Batman Begins!) That's why I was so shocked to find so many negative reviews this morning. Really really shocked. I expected there to be the typical haters and such, but I really could find very very little to criticize(ie dancing in the streets??), and the rest of the movie really cancelled that out. I realize that everyone is permitted there own opinion, but I suggest you go see it for yourself. Everyone I heard really enjoyed it, which is why I was just so stunned with all the negative reviews I've seen scince just this morning.The only thing I can see that anyone would criticize is maybe that the younger guys might not enjoy it as much because there is a lot more emotion and love scenes and fewer action scenes. All the actors were brilliant, but I really have to give props to James Franco, his acting has much improved from the first two.It was very interesting to see an evil side of Peter Parker. After all, there's only so much perfect hero the world can stand. Sandman and Venom were well-cast, but the door was let open to a number four. Personally I hope they stop now, leave the series on a high note.At points the CGI was laughable, but the characters brought out so much more that you really didn't care too much. there was also a kickass shot of Spidey leaping into the final battle in front of an American flag, reminding so my people why Spiderman is such a unique comic book hero-he lives in the real world, facing the same demons that you and I face, just on a much larger and more challenging scale.And in case you were wondering, I was really not a big Spider Man fan until this film. The first two were enjoyable, but just did not seem to have that extra bit. This one really had it. Please go see this movie and judge for yourself, I did not think it deservedso many bad reviews.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Some were adults were spider-man shirts, some women wearing Spider-man hats, a pre-movie contest from the theater staff, and of course, the little adorable munchkins with their die-hard Spider-man dolls and toys. The crowd was ecstatic and the feeling was that of a football game! I had chills! But on to the movie.... Folks it was nothing less than AMAZING! To me, it was worlds of a difference from Spider-man 2 and yet, it was still the same. If that doesn't make sense, then it will when you see the film. But what I mean by that is that you can still sense the same amount of passion and conflict between the characters. But it's different in that, Spider-man 2 (to me) seemed like such a bright, lighthearted, and glorious film especially at the end. Yet, this one seems to make the audience think ""well, the glory days of Spidey 2 are over, this is the real gritty part of life. It's not all sunshine and rainbows."" I'll give one non-spoiler example.... when tensions are high between Parker and MJ, Parker hears a police call from his scanner in his apartment. Parker turns to a depressed and upset MJ and says ""uh, go get em tiger?... OK just kidding..."" Kind of throws the whole glorious ending of Spidey 2 out the window. I felt there was a real sense of evil inside the ""black-suited Spidey"". I will admit there were some cheesy parts in it, but it only enhanced the story and really displayed Tobey Maguire's ability to pull some of these things off. I won't reveal any spoilers or give anything away for anyone but I will just tell you that the final fight scene had every single person, man, woman, and child in the theater standing up, clapping, and cheering. I haven't seen anything like that since I was at a football game! It was unbelievable! However, in the end, I guarantee there won't be a single dry eye. I'm not much of a crier but wow... what an ending. Now I have read countless reviews both professional and amateur. Most are very positive however I have to say that it does get a little bit old when people say that it was ""too much"", ""too cheesy"", or ""lacked character development."" Maybe there were too many villains, who knows, but in the end it will all fall into place. And yes it can get somewhat campy in certain scenes, but it never got too ridiculous to th point where it was in every minute of the movie. I think people can get obsessed with ""dark"" and ""gritty"" films and although this film is MUCH darker than it's predecessors, it's still somewhat uplifting in the very end. I would like to think that in such dark times that we live in, people would want to see movies that inspires them even if it's from a fictional superhero. Rather than something that makes you depressed and vengeful... All in all, a GREAT movie and the Best Spidey yet!","13 out of 24 found this helpful.

Sometimes it feels like the movie needs to move on but they are restricted because they needed to go give insight into another character. 2)The conflicts with Peter were extremely deep and a lot bigger than the film was able to give to them. He has series issues that seem to fizzle out or just look over. (Except with MJ) It was still the most psychological superhero film I have seen.

And one lesson I learned is to never expect too much from ""things."" Don't get me wrong, Spider-Man 3 was a great film, but it had too many flaws. A lot of the dialog was a little...cheesy, or should I say, corny. But I guess that's something we should probably expect from a comic-based Spiderman movie. Another thing, is that I didn't get that sense of spidy impression I got from the first two, which I really loved. The impression and mood I got from the third sequel was a little...twisted? But it could be just me.On the positive side, Spider-Man 3 has some great special effects that had me jumping out of my seat. Another positive note is the movie's plot. I thought its story would be predictable, but it turned out to be full of surprises.I have read many comments from others criticizing Spider-Man 3 of having too many things going on at the same time. Let me tell you this: THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE THIRD SEQUEL NEEDED. Imagine having to follow up with only one side of the movie's story. In other words, it would be BORING if the movie only centered around one villain or the main character. People, making a third sequel to a great franchise is not easy! Nevertheless, it was done. How? The movie had all the extra side stories, which tied in maybe a little too perfectly, yet good enough to make the movie interesting and not as boring as it could have been.So is the movie good? It's great! Is it better than the first two? No! But it definitely did well to hold up as a third sequel!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The only plus side for this film is the action but it does not save the film.

The story is very dark which is a great thing. I loved the graphics, the villains and the character depth people had in the movie. What I didn't like was the the trying to please every one, be it the kids or the romance lovers or the audience which likes movies a bit lighter.audience aspect which can come in with so many bigger budget films. So you had kids scenes which weren't needed and looked very cheesy given the dark plot of the movie. Then, while the romance angle was a key aspect in the plot and adds depth to the movie, it was handled horribly. There were trillions of cheesy scenes related to the romance angle, so much so that some people walked out of the theatre even before the ending credits started rolling in. The Venom moniker is used differently in the movie compared to the comins as while in the comics, Venom has a life of it's own, in the movie, it brings out dark inner desires out in the open and makes characters more aggressive. This subtle change provided great scope for exploring a darker angle in the movie. Inner tirbulations of Spiderman could have been emphasised upon. Instead, we see Peter Parker in a couple of egoistical comic scenes which, while funny, are a light diversion rather than a big addition. The darker scenes were shot superbly and the plot provided immense potential for this to become a great movie. This is distinct from Spiderman I and II where the plots weren't as dark and so the light nature was fair enough. A bit more focus towards the darker side would have added a lot to the movie.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Two years later, the sequel gained even more praise, justly regarded as one of the few follow-ups that actually improve on the original. Needless to say, expectations were justifiably high for the third installment. Unfortunately, Spider-Man 3 is the least strong (""worst"" is too harsh with a Raimi flick) entry in the franchise (officiallly a trilogy, but there's a strong chance a fourth movie will get made).Whereas in the first two movies he enjoyed getting his hero in trouble, this time Raimi (who also wrote the script with his brother Ivan) opens the film with an illusion of happiness: Peter Parker is an excellent student, is about to ask Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) to marry him and, best of all, has been able to convince the people of New York his web-slinging alter ego isn't the criminal J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons, still a riot) makes him appear to be. Naturally, this being a Spider-Man movie, things start going downhill pretty fast: first of all, MJ is fired from a Broadway show because of bad reviews; then there's Harry Osborn (James Franco), Peter's best friend, still eager to avenge the ""murder"" of his father (Willem Dafoe, who makes a brief but memorable appearance about twenty minutes into the film); moreover, an escaped convict named Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), aka Sandman, is revealed to be the real killer of the beloved Uncle Ben. And let's not forget Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), a cocky photographer who's trying to steal Parker's job at the Daily Bugle. Quite a lot to handle at once, don't you think?In fact, the presence of three distinct villains - generally not a good thing, as Batman & Robin ""memorably"" proved - is the main flaw of the movie, despite Raimi's attempts to construct a coherent plot with the bad guys having a section each until the overblown climactic showdown where they all come together. Not that the actors are bad or anything: James Franco's logical evolution from best friend to new archnemesis works perfectly, and Haden Church brings an unexpected maturity to a potentially campy role (besides, his arc allows Cliff Robertson, aka Uncle Ben, to make a welcome return in a couple of flashbacks). As for Grace, his problem is strictly time-related: the whole movie builds up to his character's transformation in Venom, one of the most loved villains of the comics. Raimi, however, has openly stated he doesn't like him, and so Venom gets a total of six minutes to impress us, which is too little even for Grace's considerable charm and talent (Bryce Dallas Howard, who plays MJ's potential rival Gwen Stacy, is similarly underused). Still, the ""evil trio"" allows Spidey to exclaim ""Where do all these guys come from?"", a deliberate in-joke that sets the tone for the entire film: the trailer promised a darker installment, akin to Christopher Nolan's version of Batman, and there are a few pretty grim moments, but most of the time those scenes are replaced by moments of absurd humor. This isn't a new technique coming from Raimi (he mastered the same balance between laughs and shocks in the Evil Dead trilogy), and the comic-book is well known for pulling off the exact same stunt, but this time the director hits overload, causing a tonal confusion: the usual cameos by Stan Lee and Bruce Campbell (the latter gets listed in the opening credits despite being in only one scene) are hilarious, while Peter's ""evil"" dance routine (see it to believe it) borders on ridiculous. Overall, Spider-Man 3 isn't really a bad film: the story works to a reasonable extent, Maguire and Dunst still share a perfect chemistry, and the visual effects are as stunning as ever. Nevertheless, there's a distinct feeling that something's missing. Maybe next time Raimi will remember this: in some cases, less truly is more.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Oh, and he's about to propose to Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), too.But complications arise in various forms: Peter's best pal Harry Osborn (James Franco) is still seething with anger over the death of his father (Willem Dafoe), which he attributes to Spider-Man; Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), a small-time crook who has been accidentally transformed into Sandman, has been found to be the real culprit for the death of Peter's Uncle Ben; and a mysterious black goo from space has landed into earth, eventually finding its way to Eddie Brock, who has his own reasons for wanting to kill Peter, and morphs him into Venom. As if Peter doesn't have his hands full of villains that would fill up three separate graphic novels, screenwriter Alvin Sargent gives Spider-Man yet another demon to conquer: his inability to empathize with MJ that results to a falling out in their relationship.Granted, the story lines are ultimately wrapped out nicely and the issue between Parker and Osborn is finally given a much-deserved closure; but not before a shaky set-up with far too many subplots that has no villain fully realized, resulting to a lack of an emotional core that has been the main attribute of ""Spider-Man 2"". Grace's Venom, the supposed iconic villain of Spider-Man, and Church's Sandman, ultimately come as less memorable than Alfred Molina's Dr. Octopus whose personality - motivation-wise - comes as more natural and believable.But despite the narrative faults, Raimi finally builds enough momentum going into the climax that features a New York showdown among Spider-Man, Venom, Sandman, and the New Goblin. He also manages to keep a consistent impertinent tone throughout, adding a nice blend of humor and special effects into the action that escalates in terms of scope.While the massive anticipation that comes prior to it - partly due to the intense marketing campaign Columbia does, but mostly due to the high standards set by its predecessor - is perhaps its chief undoing, ""Spider-Man 3"" is still a worthy entry into the franchise. It's certainly better than some comic-book movies that had come out previously. While it's not up to par as its predecessor, it's an adequate movie as far as summer blockbusters go, and it should satisfy fans and casual moviegoers alike.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Even though I see where they are coming from when they say that it wasn't as good as the previous film (it isn't), there are too many villains (there are), too many subplots (there are), and some contrived story elements (there are), the film is just what you would expect in a summer movie: action, adventure, and an enormously entertaining film.Following up the superb Spiderman 2 was something that might have set this film up to ""disappoint"" from the beginning. With Spidey 2, you had a magnificent villain, a sincere, human storyline to accompany the action, and a plot that worked seamlessly. The fact of the matter is that Spiderman 3 cannot match its predecessor in those respects. It simply doesn't work all the time, but when it does, it shines and creates some of the most audacious moments in the entire series.The attempt to up the ante falls flat in some respects. The film is just jam packed with so many subplots and characters that it struggles to keep everything in place. You have Peter and MJ's romance, Peter's revenge story against Flint Marko, Peter Parker ""gone bad"", Peter meets Gwen, you get the idea. If nothing else, the story line is quite convoluted and it doesn't always work. Eddie Brock, played spot on by Topher Grace, is also seems rushed. His character was one that needed further development, not to mention more ""villain"" screen time. And don't even get me STARTED on the helpful Osborne butler. Those who have seen the film will know what I'm talking about. All in all, I believe that the film would have worked out better if maybe Venom were eliminated from the script.That's not saying that Spiderman 3 lacks the sincerity of the second movie, because it certainly has its moments. We see the humanity in Flint Marko (an excellent Thomas Haden Church), or glimpses of a Harry Osborne not bent on revenge, played terrifically by James Franco. The bits that hit spot on in the first films (Aunt May giving Peter money, MJ's abusive parents) aren't quite matched, but Spiderman 3 still has plenty of genuine heart to go around. It also keeps a lot of the humor from the previous films, with an especially brilliant Bruce Campbell cameo. However, these moments are often times overshadowed by a problematic script and story.But above all, this film is great fun and a visual masterwork. The action is superb and edge-of-your-seat, and absolutely breathtaking in its best moments. Embarrassingly enough, I think I actually gasped out loud in one of those ""close call"" moments. There is one especially ""holy crap"" sequence of Sandman coming together that is so brilliant and haunting that I would almost see the film again for that one scene.Don't let the negative aspects or critic nitpicking turn you away from seeing this film. The fact of the matter is that despite a story that doesn't gel as well as those of the first two and multiple plots that could have been split up into separate movies, the audacious action, superb visuals, and terrific cast that almost makes up for the jam packed storyline make this a great summer movie, if not a completely disposable one. While it may be a step down from Spiderman 2, I can guarantee that it achieves what VERY FEW comic book films have in the past.And of course, that's not without saying that it absolutely murders, buries, and spits on films like X-Men: The Last Stand. People should stop using the term ""disappointment"" so loosely when you have films like that.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Though it was quite a great movie, I don't think it lives up to the greatness of Spider-Man 2.But most movies can't live up to Spider-Man 2 either. Besides Batman Begins, it is probably the great comic book movie of all time. Most people will go into this movie expecting it to top the last one and when it doesn't they will think it sucks.Trust me, it doesn't. Spider-Man 3 has more emotional depth than the second and it boasts one of the greatest third acts of an action movie I have ever seen. True, it is uneven at times and there is a slight feeling of it being too much plot for one movie.But in the end, it all works. You just have to let it grow on you. The evil Spider-man storyline is amazing, and every villain is emotionally complex. Not to mention that Raimi actually takes the time in this action-filled movie to deliver some real human drama for the characters.There is a large comedy element to the film, and some people might feel that it's out of place but that is the way that Spider-Man is in the comics. It's meant to be funny.So to all those that do not like Spider-Man 3, watch it again with a new outlook. You might find it's better than you first thought.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Harry now knows Parker's secret, and is still fueled by vengeance. The relationship between Mary Jane and Parker is becoming increasingly complicated, especially with her career in a downward spiral. May Parker now lives in an apartment, and is still as wise as ever with good advise.With so many characters - each with their own subplot - the film's running time is significantly longer than its predecessors and also easier to forget about some of the characters when they're not on screen. At times it felt like I was watching different films. JK Simmons is back as comic relief, but his humor feels forced, more slapstick and not as effective. In general, there were a lot more humorist elements here which seemed to clash with the issues at hand.The main villain is escaped convict Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who becomes The Sandman after an experimental freak accident. Unlike many villains, he has a very touching back story. His character also links to the events in the first 'Spider-Man'. Speaking of villains, Harry now follows in his father's footsteps, but the script can't seem to make up its mind what they have in store for Harry. Is he still Parker's friend or foe? His character swings backwards and forwards ultimately causing Harry to be a very confusing character.Enter Gwen, who gives Spider-Man THAT kiss - similar to the famous kiss Mary Jane gave him in the original 'Spider-Man'. Mary Jane goes on to say to Parker ""that was our kiss"". Uhm, but was it? Who was to say he didn't do that to other girls he saved prior to kissing her that night? We also see a very different side of Peter Parker.In general, this installment contains more (soap opera) drama and is also much slower moving. Nevertheless, it is still exciting to watch with some incredible action sequences. The very ambitious climax is almost entirely CGI and maybe a bit too fantastical. For most part the film's visuals were outstanding - especially the Sandman effects prior to the climax. Although not as good as the first two films, it was still enjoyable.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

But an extremely enjoyable and exciting one. ...isn't this all too much? This was indeed a great sequel, not just for more CGI. But it is clear that everything goes way too fast in the frantic first half. It is fun and is as deserving as the second (the first was good, but not as great). One of the film's problem lies on its abundance on special-effects. Particularly, in a ""battle that lies within"", do we really need the new villain, Sandman. Thomas Haden Church tries hard to be significant, but other than the fact that he might possibly have something to do with killing Peter Parker's uncle, he has very little to do with the film. With or without Sandman, Sam Raimi would have wrapped up a great film. And, unlike Green Goblin and Doc Ock, his origin of becoming The Sandman is, to but it bluntly, rushed. Obviously, the screenwriters just rushed it so they could get on with the circus of special effects.But lets skip the negatives. what really gave me the urge to give it a positive review is the superb performance by Tobey Maguire as, not Spider-man, but as Peter Parker. This time around, he isn't just play a nerd, but a different side of Parker, after the ""battle within"" rages inside him. For my opinion, this is his best performance among the three films. The only villain that seems to matter is Venom, a symbolism of inner evil. It was good for the writers to think of that, besides just turning him into another villain. My overall review, ""Spider-man 3"" is not that bad. For me, it was the most symbolical of the series, which was a good thing for the genre. But too bad, everything is turned bad when it comes to direction. Sam Raimi had so much in his mind at the time that it seems that putting them all together in one sitting is showing too much of a good idea. Let us be thankful, at least, that ""Spider-man 3"" is not another ""Batman and Robin"".Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The cheese sadly didn't end there as out came Spiderman 3. The cheese of the friendship between Peter and Harry ""Hey there buddy. Go get them buddy!"" ""Hey pal. They are my best friends, I would do anything for them."" Oh god! One can only take so much! I will keep my review short. Over all, what keeps the film alive are, as you would expect, the action and sfx. They are at their usual top notch quality. I'm not a great fan of over the top sfx, but that is what these Marvel films are about, so credit has to go to where its due. The characters, even Peter Parker, do not give the viewers enough to care for. The series of sub plots just creates a mini soap opera, that can become rather over bearing. By doing all they can to cram all of these characters into one film just doesn't give them enough depth. Why not save certain characters for a part four? I'm sure fan's wouldn't mind a fourth outing - it doesn't have to end on a trilogy. Anyway, I shall leave you all to judge for yourselves whether you like this film or not. I wasn't greatly impressed, often feeling annoyed, and my attention on other things other than the film itself.I was looking forward to a 4th in the series, but after 3, I think I've had enough.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

More or less, some people will love this movie while others will not. It is a different Spider-Man movie, one maybe more darker and longer. This might be because Sam Raimi has the most control on what goes on in this movie and lets face it, Raimi specializes in horror movies. For directing Spider-Man, he does a pretty good job. For writing it, he might need some practice. Spider-Man movies are completely different than horror movies (like said in another review I wrote). I think some parts of Spider-Man 3 are memorable, but some are failures. The movie begins with Peter Parker finally having his alter ego Spider-Man being accepted. Peter's connection with Mary Jane is also going swimmingly and he is going to ask her to marry him. Just then, Peter is attacked by his friend Harry, who is trying to avenge his father. This conflict grows bigger as the movie goes on (but I'll get to that later). Meanwhile, a man, Flint Marko, has escaped prison and is trying to get money for his sick daughter. While on the run, he is mutated in a sand mixture and becomes the Sandman. With his sand like powers, attempts to steal money, and being the real killer of Peter's uncle, Peter cannot stop thinking about having revenge on the Sandman. Then suddenly, Peter wakes up with a new black Spider-Man outfit that is made from a substance that links itself to a host. This Spider-Man costume makes Peter darker and stronger. With it, he fights the Sandman and thinks to have killed him. Then things start to go wrong with M.J. and Peter. M.J. has lost her job and starts to think Peter isn't there for her. Eventually, she dumps him for Harry. Peter than becomes as dark as his feelings for revenge and hurts Harry, M.J., and Eddie Brock (a person who works for the Daily Bugle). Eddie seems to hate Peter more than the others and finds Peter trying to take his black spider man suit off in a church. The black substance from the suit falls on Eddie and he becomes the new Spider-Man villain Venom. In the end, Spider-Man 3 entertains us, buts lets us down with some bad dialogue and to many plots. It would be better that in the future, that if a Spider-Man 4 comes out, David Koepp or somebody from Spider-Man 2 should write it. The results of what people might think of this movie are split into three sides. Some will love it; some will find it different (me), and little will find it bad. So overall, this movie gets a B- from me.-Ben Russell","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

If they surprise me, I may declare that 'Spider-Man 3' isn't the 3rd worst of the Spidey films, but until they change my mind it is.It's obvious that number 3 was nowhere near as good as the first two Tobey films and it's got nothing on Tom's trio, but it wasn't actually so bad really.It was disappointing that they tried a bit too hard and brought in too many characters, especially bad guys, but it's still a reasonable comic book styled film.I will point out a lot of its flaws, but please remember that it's still a good Spider-Man film and it's easier to criticise than to praise.Firstly, Harry taking on his fathers role would have been more than enough plot for this film and then the Sandman and Venom could have been used more appropriately in another instalment.I actually never liked Harry and he proves just what a d!ck he is in this one. I'm still furious with Franco for calling my boyfriend Tobey ""Frog Face"" anyway. I will not let that slide.Also annoying is Topher Grace as Eddie Brock, the rival photographer. I really don't think that he was the right casting choice and the character definitely doesn't have the time to develop as it should. Add that to the fact that he talks and acts like a teenager and he just grates on me.Brock's ""Girlfriend"" Gwen was unnecessary too. I think that it would have been good to just leave Peter's romance with MJ as it was for a bit, before introducing trouble there, because Miss Watson became an absolute needy pain in the ass and I realise that Peter wasn't exactly the most fun to be around, because his head got a bit big from his rise to fame, but she knew what she was signing on for and he did try to protect her from it. Twice!And then, of course, Spider-Man goes dark and the goth version of him dancing down the street was cringey. I could forgive the dancing inside the bar to some degree, but the whole thing was just silly, when it should have been darker to show the change.I did like the Sandman though. I know that he differed from the comic book version, but I liked the character that was portrayed and the CGI that they used to create him, which was very good for the mid 00's.The action and film in general is just what you might want from a film about an iconic character like Spidey and it's not really meant to be taken too seriously, so while it has its bad points, it's still a fun watch for a Saturday or Sunday afternoon and it shouldn't offend anyone.613.25/1000.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie was much too long, the plot was all over the place (and the editing did it no favors) and even the acting was quite poor in the serious bits, especially scenes between PP and MJ..The CGI was quite well done, especially the ""birth"" of Sandman was fairly cool, but the fight scenes were just nonsensical high-speed smash-your-head-against-the-wall-and-then-i'll-smash-yours stuff for the ADHD Generation.The strange bit in the middle was funny but completely out of place. Now, I don't expect movies to be formulaic or anything, but it just didn't fit in. Then again, despite that it was one of the better moments in the flick. Besides that, the editor at the Bugle and the maitre'd at the Constellation were some of the better moments.Best comic book movie ever? Oh please. Does not hold a candle to Sin City or Batman Begins.","19 out of 49 found this helpful.

I give it a good rating because I thoroughly enjoyed the film. This one is no exception.However, I also note some of the things that I didn't like about the film. This one is no exception for this part as well. Here's what I have to say about Spider-Man 3.I liked the characters, particularly Harry. Peter got on my nerves quite a few times throughout this film, which may have been one of Sam Raimi's intentions when he filmed the movie. I felt really bad for M.J., whose life is just not going right in this film. Harry was my favorite character. I liked how they finally went back to his nicer personality from the first film. I felt bad for him as well, especially at the end (won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen the movie and wants to). Flint Marko was an interesting character. A man who is only trying to save and protect his daughter but can't make that happen due to mistakes that get him in trouble with the cops. Eddie Brock Jr. was also an interesting character. You feel bad for him at first, but then he becomes Venom and you lose all sympathy for him. But he still manages to be a cool character.The story was filled with tough moments for many characters. There are certain scenes that got way over-the-top with Peter's character when he allows his more confident side to get the best of him. You might even despise him. They also leave us hanging with Venom (who I hope will be in the fourth movie). I didn't like the ending very much. Very sad, but it also wasn't the traditional Spider-Man movie ending. I did like that Sandman has a possible future in the movies.Overall, this was a good, entertaining film, but it's also quite a disappointment. Don't expect this to be the best installment of the franchise. Even I have to admit, it's not. Try to enjoy it though.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Really Not As Bad As People Say.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3112206/?ref_=tt_urv","Movie-ManDan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur31261952/?ref_=tt_urv","27 October 2014","People were all excited to see Venom in Spiderman 3 since Venom is Spiderman's coolest and most popular villain. And since Spiderman 2 was so well-received, it would only make sense that the follow-up movie would possibly be better. I will be the first to admit that this was not as good as Spiderman 2, but I would say this is the second best Spiderman movie made. A little bit better than the first and much better than these new ones. I can see why some people would nit- pick at this, but they go too far by saying this was trash and that it was the worst superhero movie they'd seen. Ever see Superman IV? That's about was bad as 1959's Santa Claus.The movie starts off with Peter planning on proposing to Mary Jane, but her frustrations with her Broadway career and jealousy of Gwen Stacy liking Peter gets the better of her. That is a flaw. We waited for two full movies for Peter to get the girl and he still can't? However, Maguire and Dunst are great actors so there is really nothing to worry about. Plus this adds tension because everybody wants Peter to get Mary Jane and he still has troubles. But you know he is just one step closer. There is also Harry Osborn who has become New Goblin and wants to destroy Spiderman. He gets amnesia in the process, but soon comes out of it and adds problems to Peter and May Jane's relationship. I don't think that Franco was all that good as Harry and New Goblin, but because of the build-up and characterization, the feud is awesome. And Harry screwing up the relationship makes the love story original and not very dull. Plus, there is Flint Marko who turns out to be uncle Ben's killer. He becomes Sandman and wants Spiderman gone. Flint is a bit weak, his story and place was weak, but when he turns into Sandman, look out! He is soooo awesome. The last villain is Venom: Edward Brock Jr. Eddie Brock is an up-and-coming photographer that envies Peter Parker as Parker outdoes Brock and his girlfriend, Gwen Stacy, takes a liking to him. Played by skinny Topher Grace, I found this to be the biggest flaw. A bizarre piece of goo crash-lands on earth and turns Spiderman black. It also alters his personality. Peter becomes mean emo-Peter who struts around and dances randomly. Some parts of this were dumb, but Maguire was very convincing. Realizing the toll it takes on him, Peter takes it off and it lands on Eddie Brock, turning him into Venom. Another thing I liked about the toll it takes on Peter was his transition from nice, timid, Peter to vain, weird, emo- Peter. He was convincing as both, and his links to the emo and back were very well-done. A transitional character down the right way, like here, always impress me. Eddie Brock has always been displayed as a big guy, so Grace was a wrong call. Plus Venom is barely in it, when he is, they mostly show Brock's face. So I can se why most people would feel cheated by that. But when Venom is actually Venom, it is awesome. Everybody has to admit that Venom looked really cool. The end sequence when Spiderman fights both Venom and Sandman is monumental. The stakes were high and you really thought Spiderman was going to die. Then Harry finally saving Spiderman and both fighting Venom and Sandman was even cooler. The actions sequences and special effects were dazzling, so I don't get why those weren't praised like int he others. The character development and chemistry is an all-time high in the series, but some of it was too much, so the viewers felt cheated. The use of villains made the viewers feel cheated too, but it really want that bad because the positives erased most negatives. But because this was poorly received, producers tried too hard to come up with a great story for Spiderman 4. With too many disagreements, the plug was pulled and Sony rebooted the series. I hate what they've done. Spiderman 3 had the stuff for a sequel we were waiting for. Dr. Connors still had a piece of the goo that Peter gave him, Eddie Brock's death wasn't shown very well, so there would have been more Venom and maybe even Carnage. Instead, we now have arrogant, undeserving Peter Parker with villains used worse than this.Tobey's Spiderman is a true hero. He was played as a total loser that got powers that gave him the confidence he needed to be a better person. He always triumphs over odds as the going gets tough.3/4","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'm sorry to say this, but Spiderman 3 was hyped up in the ads and ended up being a sore loser. Okay, so I sit down, and the movie starts. The dialogue was weak right from the beginning of the movie, but hey, I told myself hang on in there, the movie will get better right? The dialogue, acting, and storyline were all over the place without any real feeling or meaning. Right when the action was getting good, the film makers would ruin the scene with garbage. As in garbage, I mean distasteful humor, bad acting, a bad script, and just bad scenes! They made Tobey Maguire into a fool with the scenes they put him in. The only good in the movie was from a few good actions scenes, but hey, that's all you'll get for 10 dollars.There was no connection between scene to scene as the storyline was scattered with so many different villains. To make matters worse, Peter Parker himself was scattered in his personality as well, is he a nerd, superhero, arrogant superhero, cheater, villain, friend, selfish man, or how about EMO. Must I say more about EMO? You'll know what I mean...Common, it's Spiderman 3!-Jack","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

As a Spidey fanboy, it made me very happy. It excited me as I knew this series was picking up speed. I expected to be blown away. What a got was a decent movie that did a little too much.To start, the characters as always were good. Tobey plays Peter well, Franco is wonderful as Harry (okay as Goblin), and J.K. Simmons is just masterful as Jameson. Kirten Dunst has caught some crap for her role. I thought a lot of her. Unfortunately, I think her character helped stain this movie. She was paranoid and jealous. Not a terrible performance in my opinion, but something to sneer at a bit. I didn't like the idea of Topher grace as Eddie Brock, and I still don't, but from my perspective he didn't do a bad job. The attitude, personal grief and vengeful feelings toward Spider-Man were well displayed.Another thing that I believe stained the movie was Peter's aggressive side. Some scenes in the movie truly brought out Peter's dark side manifested by the alien suit, such as the scene where Spidey confronted Sandman in the sewer. Otherwise, it was pretty lame with the dance moves and look/attitude of a common jerk, rather than an evil being.They also tried to fit too much into one film. Venom should have been left to the next movie (as it appears there will be one) rather than slipped in and dealt with the way he was. Adding the Sandman and Goblin to the mix and you had a mess of emotions. I LOVED how the first two movies had the right amount of action AND drama (the second was masterful at that in my opinion), but there's was a little too much emotion in this movie for my taste (coming from a guy who loves deep, emotional movies).Gwen Stacy was ruined from the start of the series and never should have made an appearance in my opinion, but she was included and I can deal with that.But there are also good points. The action is very good, the movie does not fail to entertain, and there are some well represented events and characters, some doing justice to those in the comics. The portrayal of Sandman was a very touching one, and Thomas Haden Church did an excellent job. James Franco did a good job as well, although his psychotic nature (and voice) as the Goblin didn't QUITE live up to the history of the character.Overall, there were faults that made this clearly the runt of the trilogy thus far, but the movie is still packed with enough action, special effects, emotion and suspense to keep the average Spidey fan (and moviegoer) happy. A solid film at least.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

An extraterrestrial symbiote crashing to Earth and bonds with Peter, influencing his behavior for the worse. When Peter abandons the symbiote, it finds refuge in Eddie Brock, a rival photographer, Eddie Brick, causing Peter to face his greatest challenge.This movie had me feeling some cool amazing emotions. The main criticism to me is Venom, because he was the biggest character promoted in the trailers and posters to the film and he only got ten minutes of screen time, now, if they would have made this three hours long, this film would have been fine.The music by Christopher Young is amazing and Danny Elfman's themes from the first two SPIDER-MAN films and it is amazing. The story of Sandman is just emotionally powerful and Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko / Sandman is emotionally powerful in his performance. The story of the symbiote was confusing as heck, but when Eddie turned into Venom, that confusion all went away.The visual effects and action sequences are just amazing in this film, but I hate the fight between Harry and Peter because they are supposed to be friends, but they are not, until at the end of the damn movie. What the freak happened man? The acting survives. Tobey Maguire and the returning cast all do really great jobs this time around. Topher Grace as Venom / Eddie Brock, I don't hate him, I just wish his character was developed a little bit more. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy, she is okay, but Emma Stone's version of the character is just amazing and it is really cool.Overall, SPIDER-MAN 3 does a few things right, but with some major issues and like I said, if the film was three to four hours long, it would have been fine. I'm giving a 7/10.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

"6","/10","So Much Unrealized Potential","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8420897/?ref_=tt_urv","Reviews_of_the_Dead","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23318905/?ref_=tt_urv","9 August 2022","This sequel was one that I was excited to see when it was coming to the theater. I saw this in college and I'll be honest, I was let down. The big reason for me was the fact that it has my favorite comic book characters of Venom and Spider-Man. I'll come back to that though. Jaime and I did watch this one so we could watch the newest Spider-Man movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since I knew there was cross-over.We pick this up where the last one left off. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) wants to marry Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). He is doing well in class. The problem is that he doesn't have a lot of money and his best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), killed his father. There is also an interesting dynamic here of Peter becoming arrogant. This causes a rift between him and MJ. To make matters worse, he has a rival at the Daily Bugle of Eddie Brock (Topher Grace).There is an added dimension as an alien symbiote attaches to Spider-Man and his alter ego. It gives him a black suit. This entity also makes him more aggressive. Harry also learns of his father's research and becomes the new Green Goblin. Peter learns more of what happened to his Uncle Ben and how Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) could be involved. This man becomes the villain known as the Sandman.With this most rewatch, it isn't as bad I remember it. That's not to say I think it is good now though. I do like what they do with the character of Peter Parker. I can also see why this line died where it did. The pacing is off. We get a big of Spider-Man vs. Sandman early but then we don't come back to that until much later. There is an hour until he gets the black suit and even then, it takes time to develop that. We also only get Venom for the last like 30 minutes and he barely has screentime. What I will say though is that Grace was miscast there. Maguire is fine along with Dunst, Church, Bryce Dallas Howard, James Cromwell, Bruce Campbell and Elizabeth Banks. Franco wasn't very good. J. K. Simmons is great though as J. Jonah Jameson. Outside of him, no one stands out.Other than that, I'd say that the CGI is fine. It has spotty parts. Sam Raimi as the co-writer of the screenplay and director are fine. We get a bit of his flare in this that I appreciate. There was potential here, but it is unrealized for sure.My Rating: 6 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie is probably worth seeing, but I don't think it came close to living up to the hype.I'd compare it to V for Vendetta. Really cool action scenes randomly thrown in to a drawn out drama plot.

I was one of the many who was there on the first weekend and the opening applause in my central London cinema was a clear indication of the super-hero's enduring popularity. Yet, although Columbia Pictures has spun its web and pulled in many punters, the success is not wholly deserved.As always, there are some superb special effects, as there should be with a budget of $250M. I particularly enjoyed the creation if the Sandman character, although it was a pity that the subtlety of his features was lost as he became bigger and uglier. However, the black stuff that turns Spider-Man evil looks pathetic and its arrival on earth through a meteor is so lame.Sam Raimi is the director for the third time which provides continuity of style and narrative but, for the first time, he is involved in the storyline and the script and here the movie is sadly lacking. There are too many villains, too much romancing, and not enough genuine drama. The final scene especially is really weak - and the whole thing is about 20 minutes too long.Where the third movie does score is with some genuinely funny moments, such as J.K. Simmons performance as newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson, Bruce Campbell as a restaurant's maître d', and Tobey Maguire giving a swaggering show like a John Travolta in ""Saturday Night Fever"", but basically we want our super-heroes to deliver thrills more than humour and I knew this wasn't working when I found that the black-suited Spider-Man was attracting me more than the original incarnation of the arthropod.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's bad enough when it infests romantic comedies and thrillers, but when it starts to invade previously strong super hero film franchises, that's where I start getting annoyed. Spider-Man 3 is an overblown, overstuffed, joyless fiasco that is riddled with plot holes and character motivations and actions that make no sense at all. Series director Sam Raimi seems to have lost the confidence that guided the previous two films, and has given us an overly juvenile romantic melodrama broken up by over the top action sequences that are often soulless. Young hero Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is finally starting to enjoy some success as his alter ego, Spider-Man. We can tell early on that success is starting to go to Parker's head, and so can his girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). She's feeling left out, since Spider-Man pretty much dominates his life. Peter has plans to propose to Mary Jane, but there's never the opportunity to do so. It certainly doesn't help that there's a certain pretty young aspiring model named Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), who seems to be attracted to both of Peter's identities. Because the movie is infected by the curse of the Idiot Plot, Peter never says anything, and keeps on letting things escalate out of his control. He even intentionally makes things worse by sharing a kiss with Gwen in public in front of Mary Jane. Why, you ask, would he do this when he's planning to propose to M.J.? Because if he didn't, there wouldn't be any reason for turmoil in the relationship. His actions answer solely to the plot.Aside from the romantic melodrama, the web slinger has three different villains to contend with. Peter's former best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), still is holding a grudge against him and has decided to follow in his crazy villain dad's footsteps, and is now zooming around the city as the New Goblin, hell-bent on killing Peter. There's also a convict on the run by the name of Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church) who, while on the run from the cops, unknowingly goes running into a massive science experiment and in the process gets his molecules rearranged and mixed with sand particles so that he can literally change his form into that of a hulking monster made of sand that kind of looks like King Kong crossed with kitty litter. Oh, did I forget to mention there's also a black blob-like substance from outer space that recently crashed nearby the city? This is tied into our third villain, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who is a freelance photographer at Parker's day job at the Daily Bugle, and he's vying for a permanent position. When Parker humiliates him on the job, that's reason enough to drive the guy psycho. When he comes into contact with the alien substance, he's transformed into a black Spider-Man like monstrosity called Venom, who solely acts as a special effect for the film's climactic action sequence. Spider-Man 3 is so stuffed with plot, characters, and filler material (including an out of the blue musical dance number in a jazz club) that the movie can barely contain it all within its nearly two and a half hour length. Plot points and characters are introduced and dropped seemingly at whim. What made the previous Spider-Man films work is that they were much more intimate affairs. We were drawn into Peter's world, and the films mainly centered on a small group of characters. This time around, there's too many characters and too many story lines vying for our attention. Even long-standing memorable supporting characters are generally shafted, and seem to exist only because they were in the other movies. Peter's loving Aunt May pops up just long enough to spew out some Yoda-like fortune cookie advice to him in one or two scenes, and the comical blustering windbag boss as the Daily Bugle, J. Jonah Jameson is reduced to a mere forgettable cameo.The action sequences have largely lost the personal touch that was found in the previous films as well. We are no longer watching characters we have come to be interested in doing battle, but merely a multi million dollar special effects reel. That's because the villains are the most forgettable bunch to ever grace a Spider-Man film. Flint Marko initially seems intriguing and a somewhat tortured villain, but as soon as he gets in that lab accident, he stops being human and spends most of the movie as a towering CG sand monster who rips through the city. We never get a chance to truly know him, since he completely disappears for a large chunk of the film, only to come back for the climactic showdown as the Stay Puff Sandman. Eddie Brock/Venom comes across even worse, as we never get a truly successful story for him, or a reason why he should even be there in the first place. The movie hints at a number of possible reasons for Brock to hate Peter/Spider-Man, but never elaborates on them. Like everything else, it is barely touched upon and comes and goes whenever the screenplay sees fit. I'm not so delusional as to think this review will have any affect on the film's box office. Spider-Man 3 is certain to make a killing this weekend, and will probably go on to produce some big numbers. The question is, like all summer blockbusters, how will it be remembered? When all the hype, fast food promotions, and fanfare go away, you're forced to see the movie for what it really is. Spider-Man 3 has a lot of plots and special effects trying their hardest to prevent us from seeing just how hollow it really is at its center.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

"","","Raimi Went for Way Too Much and It Didn't Work","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2611168/?ref_=tt_urv","Michael_Elliott","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13134536/?ref_=tt_urv","13 May 2012","Spider-Man 3 (2007) ** (out of 4) The final film in the trilogy has Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) trying to get on with their lives but new villains (Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace) cause problems as does a strange black entity, which causes personalities to change. While all of this is going on you still have Harry (James Franco) wanting revenge. SPIDER-MAN 3 hit with a pretty loud thud from both fans and critics and I've read several opinions on why the film didn't work. To me, the biggest thing to blame for its failure is SPIDER-MAN 2. That film mixed the character development with the action so well and since fans and critics ate it up so much I think writer-director Sam Raimi was just under pressure to try and recapture that magic. This third film gives us much more character development, much more story, a bigger running time to deal with it and non-stop crying scenes and in the end the film just comes across as a complete mess. Trying to make an entire film about the relationship between Parker and Mary Jane was just a mistake because there's really no chemistry here and you really can't see what one would see in the other. The entire stuff dealing with Mary Jane's professional career was just boring and never worked either. The stuff dealing with Parker's personal problems really wasn't interesting either. The only good stuff, in regards to the character development, comes from the Sandman character as Thomas Haden Church easily steals the film delivering a nice performance and making his subplot work. Maguire, Dunst and Franco are all good in their parts and Grace gives a nice performance but there's just not much they can do. The film does contain some excellent special effects and especially all of the stuff dealing with the Sandman. Still, in the end, you have a weak screenplay and the movie simply isn't going to work and I think this is a case where the writer just tried to do too much and in the end it didn't work.","3 out of 20 found this helpful.

I have heard that not all changes are good ones, but I didn't notice any of those because in my case: ignorance is a bless. Unfortunately: all of this is a moot point given the fact that one doesn't need to read the comic-books in order to grasp the flaws this film holds.Nothing is really bad though, but some stuff just doesn't work out nicely. The big battle near the end is a little too hectic for its own good. Also near the end: we get two emotional scenes but neither one of those really do the job since they lack the intensity. The moral speeches by May Parker, who serves more as a mother than an aunt for Peter, become repetitive and we see too little of actor J.K. Simmons who is ever-excellent in playing the chief of the New York City newspaper The Daily Bugle.But there is some good stuff too. The only way for this film to be even more spectacular than the previous one was to add an extra enemy which is why Spider-Man now faces more than one enemy at the same time. And the new villains are indeed quite fascinating. There is Sandman who is exactly what the name tells you: he's a man of sand! And there is also Venom which is some sort of a sticky black substance that is actually alive. And when it comes into contact with a human being, it brings out the worst in them! Also: a new version of the Goblin comes into play, but this character is tied between the love for his friends Peter and Mary Jane and getting the proper revenge for his father's murder.The special effects are spectacular and this is of course a must! The birth of the Sandman is arguably the single most breathtaking scene of all three Spider-man movies. It reminded me a little of the 1999-adventure movie ""The mummy"" where the evil creature Imhotep also does a very nice trick with sand. The shapeless creature Venom is undoubtedly the strangest but also the most vicious of all superhero villains ever depicted in a Spider-man movie (or any other comic-book adaptation; for that matter). It produces a few laughs when we get to lay our eyes on the new Peter Parker but brings out just as many semi-thrills when - near the end - the real Venom makes an appearance. The many battles are also entertaining to watch albeit some of those are a bit overdone perhaps. In the first two films J.K. Simmons provided the most laughs and while he is still amusing, I thought that the funniest moment this time came from Bruce Campbell playing a French waiter.In short: ""Spider-Man 3"" is not as good as its predecessors due to a few flaws that could have been prevented, but still entertains and that's the main thing! It's a typical good popcorn movie that focuses more on SFX and action than on any of its characters and their storyline.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Spiderman 3 is a bit of a letdown. Too many villains, not enough real story development & the story line many times feels rushed & clunky. The ""evil"" Peter Parker is mostly just goofy rather than menacing & dark. It is my understanding that the writer who penned the 2nd film really wasn't involved as much in the development of this third film. And it shows. Spiderman 3 has plenty of entertaining moments for sure ( Bruce Campbell has a hilarious cameo) but, Spiderman 3 suffers from a severe case of overkill. The Sandman is cool but slightly under-used. Venom is a mere shadow of his comic book/animated self & the battle between Harry & Peter Parker is one of the better moments/fight scenes in the film. I think Rami needs to do # 4, take his time & try to get some cinematic redemption. I predict once the word gets out on Spiderman 3 (about a week or so), the box office returns will be a big letdown when it's all said & done.BloodStone's Recommendation: Spiderman 3 is worth a look if your expectations aren't sky-high.Bloodstone's Rating: 7/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

VERY few things could redeem this film, one of which was the fact that my girlfriend paid for my ticket. It was almost as cheesy as the 90's Batman films... No, scratch that, it was almost as cheesy as the 60's Batman show. The action is great, but only because it's the most expensive film ever made. Literally. And did I mention there's even less comic continuity than in X-Men 3? There are three different villains, and four if you count Peter Parker battling against his symbiote-controlled self. Is that really necessary? Each villain easily could have had its own movie, like the other two films. It seems like the producers, knowing what awesome potential it could have, tried to cram as much action and cameos and campy humor and touching love scenes and powerful self-realization moments... well, you get the picture.One thing movie producers seem to be doing nowadays, and of which this dump-heap of a movie is a perfect example, is thinking that, since 'less is more,' then more will be super-more! Unfortunately, these people are still allowed to live and, even worse, make movies.The bottom line is, if you really liked superhero films like Batman Begins , DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE.

If you're not too interested in superhero films and are just going for James Franco, maybe see this movie.

This time, Peter faces multiple challenges, both personal and external, as he battles not one, but three formidable foes: Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), New Goblin (James Franco), and the dark symbiote Venom (Topher Grace).The film attempts to weave a complex narrative with these multiple villains, and while it delivers thrilling action sequences and impressive special effects, it often feels overstuffed. The inclusion of the black-suited Spider-Man brings an intriguing exploration of Peter's darker side, but the film struggles to balance this with its numerous subplots and character arcs.Kirsten Dunst returns as Mary Jane Watson, providing a grounding emotional presence amidst the chaos. However, the film's attempts at deepening character relationships sometimes come across as melodramatic. The performances are solid, but the script doesn't always give the characters room to breathe.Despite its flaws, ""Spider-Man 3"" offers entertainment value and concludes Raimi's trilogy with spectacle and heart. It's a visually engaging film that, while not reaching the heights of its predecessors, still provides a satisfying if somewhat uneven, superhero experience.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Fun, But Crammed And Thin","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1952956/?ref_=tt_urv","theodoremartin","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10237723/?ref_=tt_urv","28 September 2008","The strengths of the first two ""Spider-Man"" films are what you'd expect from Sam Raimi - insane action with moments (and many of them) of characterization. With all of the action, you never feel rushed or short-changed, which made his films sorta the ""thinking man's action movies."" The same could be said for Tim Burton's take on Batman in his first go-around with the character. Unfortunately, he fell on his face cramming two brilliant villains in one movie making for a much malaigned hurried pace that ruined what could've been two good movies. The lesson here is obvious - too many things can simply add up to too many things. I had to think long and hard, obviously, about ""Spider-Man 3."" (It took me THIS long to fairly write a review!) Because there's a lot to like - I'm not being sarcastic here - yet there's simply too much jammed into the movie. I'm stating the obvious, seeing what other people wrote, but when you really want to love a movie and see it just coming in slightly above average, one hopes the criticisms will add up, thus keeping producers, studio heads, et.al., from being too ""commercially ambitious."" Attacking the thinness and rushed pace is easy. Mentioning that it's a disappointment when you expected more is a given. Instead, let's look at what makes us love this movie, warts and all. There are still moments of characterization here that makes it more deep than a simple summer popcorn movie. For example, the complicated relationship between Peter (Tobey Maguire) and the important people in his life. Harry (James Franco, much underrated) and MJ (Kirsten Dunst, more than just a pretty face) get a lot of screen time here and none of it is wasted. Harry blaming Peter for Norman's death isn't repetitive, it's refreshed anew by bringing in the traumatic amnesia that plagued the Goblin characters in the comic book (a good, not overstated, nod to comic continuity). Harry's ultimate fate has that much more poignancy when it's played out because of this. The shoe being on the other foot in Peter's relationship with MJ was also a tad interesting, because it complicates things and that's always good for a romance that will be played out in a franchise. It also tends to display how different Peter and MJ are - when Peter's life is going down the tubes, he internalizes it. MJ however lashes out at Peter whan she loses her role on Broadway. Thus the issue arises - IS MJ ""perfect?"" Nope. She can be self-centered too. A conflicted villain is also interesting, which is why I rather liked Thomas Hayden Church's Flint Marko/Sandman. We see a guy just trying to make money to save his daughter. Being made into a silicon-based lifeform adds just enough of the spice to make him tough and tender. He may be a crook, but he's being a crook (now) for the right reasons. That they didn't split up the villains for two movies - giving both of them their due - is more of the shame looking at Church's take on Sandman. Topher Grace also deserved more as he was giving a good sociopathic charm to Eddie Brock BEFORE he became Venom. At first, he's merely Peter's cheerfully obnoxious rival at the Daily Bugle. However, we see hints of his delusional nature with how he inflates a ""coffee"" with Gwen Stacy (sorry I can't remember the actress' name right now, and that's another issue with too much in here - the new people don't have much time to shine) into a ""fantastic night."" But the problem here is HIS story is a bit too rushed. Wasn't it possible to have just the Symbiotic Thing that Venom becomes with Eddie play an (interestingly) understated villain in making Peter ""bad"" in this movie, paving the way for an expanded, and thus much better, fourth movie? Ah, but I'm being drawn into the negatives again. While we're on that subject, I certainly hope there wasn't a real effort to rewrite Uncle Ben's death. I hope not - Flint's flashback of the evening is left, I think deliberately vague, - because it'd be really too weak. The point overall is that ""Spider-Man 3"" is rather entertaining and really worth the buying. But oh, what could've been.....","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Peter is also drawing attention from his lab partner Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) which in combination with Mary Jane's problems with her acting career and Peter's Spider-Man persona becoming an intrusive presence are putting a strain on their relationship. Meanwhile Peter's former best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco) angered from the revelation that Peter is Spider-Man and believing Spider-Man killed his father, Norman (Willem Dafoe), becomes the New Goblin and sets to kill Peter only to be rendered an amnesiac during their fight with no memory that Peter is Spider-Man. Peter also deals with a cocky arrogant rival photographer, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), who's after his position taking pictures of Spider-Man and is met with the revelation that Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) was the actual killer of his Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). Peter is shaken by these events which only get worse when an alien symbiote bonds with Peter giving him a black version of his Spider-Man suit that elevates his strength and abilities but also his darker impulses and aggression.Following the continued success of the Spider-Man series with Spider-Man 2 development began on a third film in the series. Raimi had initially intended the film to feature Harry Osborn as the New Goblin and Sandman as the villains, but received pressure from producer Avi Arad to add a third villain to the line-up. While Raimi suggested Vulture as played by Ben Kingsley, producers felt that Raimi was being guided by his love for the Silver Age stories and villains and neglecting more current fans and heavily pushed Venom for the film. From the previous films, it's always been clear that Raimi tried to adhere pretty closely to the mood, tone, and plots of the original Stan Lee and Steve Ditko stories and when those are contrasted against the Black Suit Spider-Man/ Venom issues that are considerably darker in their almost ""body horror"" themes and with Venom are emblematic of the ""Dark Age"" of comics where the line between heroes and villains was blurred with more morally ambiguous characters and anti-heroes including venom. Sony, unbeknownst to Raimi had intended to capitalize on the popularity of the Venom character by launching a spin-off character from the main Spider-Man series hence why they pushed for Venom's inclusion. With so many new elements to add in to not only account for Venom, but also additionally characters related to venom, the symbiote, and the black suit the writers found themselves struggling to fit all these elements in that it was briefly considered splitting the story into two movies until the writers couldn't find an appropriate break in the middle act to allow such an approach. Spider-Man 3 is film that still has moments of greatness in it, but they're often overshadowed by ridiculous scenes that don't mesh with the dark source material the film tries to adapt.The action sequences and effects are still on point with the fights between Sandman and Spider-Man particularly great. The effects used to convey Sandman's powers especially a two minute long scene where Flint is trying to reassemble himself and get used to his powers is a really strong moment of visual storytelling and an impressive effects showcase. The movie also features some really good scenes between Rosemary Harris returning once again to play Aunt May and Peter Parker with the two having a really sweet dynamic that sells them as family.Unfortunately outside of the action and effects, the writing and characters suffer from a lack of breathing room as plot threads become as tangled and stretched as Spider-Man's webbing with a lot of contrivances happening in artificial manners feel hollow, manipulated, and stupid. Not only does the Alien Symbiote just randomly crash near Peter Parker, but Harry gets amnesia, the police withheld the identity of Uncle Ben's suspected killer for no real reason, and the interpersonal drama between Mary Jane and Peter becomes really petty with Peter's inflated ego and Mary Jane's passive aggressiveness of disguising her frustrations rather than confronting them makes their scenes rather grating. And then we have Eddie Brock aka Venom. Most of the problems in this film can be traced to the fact that Eddie Brock was crowbarred into the movie. Both Harry Osborn and Eddie Brock have grudges against Spider-Man/Peter Parker and with both of them now in the movie and not enough focus dedicated to one or the other, it botches what should be the pay off for Harry for a three film arc, and rushes through Eddie Brock's development in what feels like maybe forty minutes in what should have taken at minimum 2 movies to get to because Sony was foaming at the mouth for its Venom spin-off, not that any one would want one because Topher Grace is egregiously miscast. This isn't Topher Grace's fault, even if a more appropriate actor had been chosen they still would've dealt with a script that didn't understand the Venom character. Not only does the character speak in identifiers ""I"" instead of ""We"", but the portrayal doesn't have Venom's twisted morality of ""guilty"" and ""innocent"" that makes him feel justified in his actions, not only that but Venom refers to himself as ""The Bad Guy"" in the climax.Spider-Man3 does have individual scenes or performances that reach the level of the first two films, but thanks to being overstuffed with excess bloat the movie has too many plot threads and characters competing for attention and ends up underserving all of them. Not a complete misfire, but falls well short of the standards set in the series.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But, for some reason, I always enjoyed the spider man movies. I guess its because there is definitely a cute story with Peter and M.J. and their basically my age, so i enjoy watching it...and a lot of the fight scenes had always been Peter saving someones life, which is always emotional and fun to see. So, Im reading the other comments about this movie, and I see that most people are disappointed with the lack of great fight scenes, or the fact that it goes against the actual comic book. I could care less about that. I will agree with some other writers who say there was way too much going on and then they just threw some scenes in that really seem to not belong, just to make room for the other characters. And the whole bad Peter thing, really stupid and rushed. I was thinking during the movie that there are way too many villains, but, it kinda made for a really good ending, so I appreciated it at the end. Though, they still could have gotten rid of him being his own nemesis. The truth is some things could have waited for the next movie...but, is there gonna be another? And, if so, if its with different actors then it may just not be worth seeing anyways. So, if u are someone like me, who just enjoys the movies for the tearful, emotional story, its a pretty good one. I think for the people who care more about the fighting and true spider man story, you may be disappointed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The focus on Peter's relationship with Harry following the previous films was executed perfectly. The focus on his relationship with MJ is a bit repetitive and sometimes a bit inconsistent. As for the Villains I really loved the Sandman and his motives for what he's doing. The casting in this movie was brilliant, especially with J. K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jameson. I also think the soundtrack is excellent and the fight scenes were top notch. Overall it doesn't live up to the first two movies in the series but it does offer more than The Amazing Spider-Man.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Seriously, there's too many things happening at once here! You've got the Parker/MJ/Harry love triangle, the introduction of sandman , the introduction of gwen stacey, the introduction of eddie brock , the venom/symbiote saga AND harry loosing his memory. Its too much to fit in one film-the venom story alone is enough to fill a 2 hour movie. Sam raimis film tries to give you as much bang for your buck as possible , but it spreads it self thin by including too many different elements and not fleshing them out enough . As a result, the moments that are supposed to be big and dramatic loose a lot of their impact, villains aren't given enough time to shine and character relationships seem a little hollow- it all feels rushed and insincere.This may sound like a bad review, but its not.Spiderman 3 has good things going for it; the new additions to the cast do great with the material their given and raimi makes sure that there's a welcome dose of humour .But on the whole though its lacking - spiderman 1 and 2 were such brilliant films that seeing a mediocre entry to the series just feels disappointing.Spiderman 3 is watchable , but no way as enjoyable,exciting or as heartfelt as its predecessors. Lets hope spidey 4 gets it right .........","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

City and people that live in it wasted on this crap movie, they where just used as a prop for destructing and latest CGI Effects. I hope Sam Raimi moves on from this PG made for Hollywood bank machine and make his own original movies for adults that are not restricted to PG, I felt like his hands was tied on this.Sam Raimi I know would've made spider-man go all way to be evil or his girl maybe sleep with his best friend or something. Spiderman kisses another girl for picture shoot now she breaks up with him to further the dumb story so spider man can turn bad ass and practice his moves for Dancing with the Stars. Hope you guys know scripts in a big franchise needs to get green light from studios and DC comics before they film, I bet they had to do a lot of rewrites to please everyone, thats why this one is really thin, everyone involve on this was playing it safe.Spiderman foes here have no reason to revenge anything, I mean 1 guy loses his job so now he has to kill spider-man, I know this is comic book popcorn movie for kids but this is very weak, bad acting is forgivable for movie like this, but this movie nowhere near as interesting as X-men 3 as a wrap-up or sequel movie, It felt really all jammed packed and rushed to fit as much effects and action in 2 hours. The plot and characters is left for chance, only Bruce Campbell, and butler was only people in movie that I liked and didn't letdown spider-man 3. Why not Riami make a spoof of spider-man using Campbell and the butler, would've made a more entertaining movie.Good movie needs real evil enemies, and if their backdrop is in city then citizens need to be in real danger for movie to be effective and hero to save them. This movie I felt had nothing but a showcase for special effects, I hope Sam Raimi goes back to making his own movies and forget strings attached sequels and do what he does best. Movies like Evil Dead and Darkman great films hes done in past, There was no need to do this spider-man except for money. Let this be a lesson, X-Men 3 or Superman 2 is holy grail for Hollywood to shoot for, If you look at that superman 2 you can see great evil foes at work in that film and why it worked so well. PS: I think Riami just was sick of making this movie and rushed it by so he can get his paycheck. Heard he doesn't want to make another spider-man. Popcorn movies sequels should be limited to 2 sequels, thats 3 parts, History has proved part 3 always suck, Except for Evil Dead series.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Ladies and Gents I have been a huge spider-man fan since I was a kid and when I saw the the teaser trailer of this third instalments with him hanging up-side in his black symbiont suit I for one was counting the days to see it. From reading other comments I can understand why people felt let down, I mean all this hype going round and Sam Rami had taken a very bold step in introducing the symbiont which I felt was too early in the franchise but being that the first two movies where brilliant it was understanding that he had to deliver the goods and bring something new and fresh to the table.On the whole the movie was not that bad, but as a Spider-man fan I did feel a little something missing. The whole concept of the darker side of Spider-man was good but unfortunately we never really truly see it go to that level I mean any spider-man fan will tell you that what the symbiont CAN REALLY DO. The film was also rushed in places with things getting hectic and chaotic which made it seem messy! We Mary-Jane juggling her own problems with Harry Osborn donning the suit of his father, the Sandman seemed to be the central villain in this movie and not Venom who seemed more like a tweener (what the Fu!K)with silly little sub-plots firing left right and centre. On the other side I really enjoyed watching the symbiont spider-man being he was given very little screen time , the fight sequences were good and still filling . And the comedic moments were funny as well. The stars that stood out were Haden as the Sandman, although I felt that they got the character of the Sandman wrong he still done a wonderful job and J.K. Simmons as J.Jonah Jameson was better this time round. James Franco was surprisingly a lot darker than Tobey Maguire who at times was starting to show the his darker side but then abruptly cuts it off and Kirsten Dunst was just plain moaning and whining whilst Topher seemed to behave a lot more like Carnage than Venom !Too conclude Spider-man 3 could of been the best in the series but unfortunately Sam Rami crammed wayyyy too much into it which makes it seem messy rather than mind-blowing and it could of been one hell of an exit for Maguire and Dunst who will not be reprising there roles. I would like to see Venom back for the 4th instalments but Rami should sit down and take it easy rather than rushing it because I felt this could of been the best one in the franchise. On the whole I have tried my hardest to defend this film the best I can because I did feel that others were cutting it for no reason but any movie movie goer or Spider-man fan can tell you that there a problems clearly visible but I do hope this is not an omen of any kind. Spider-man 3 is worth a look at but after all the hype it merely satisfies and not amazes.SPIDER-MAN 3 : 8.1 OUT OF 10THE GREATEST BATTLE LIES WITHIN!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The bulk of the movie functions as a cure for insomnia and washroom breaks. The overwrought romantic story line is suffocatingly sentimental. The picture feels formulaic, as if all the innovation has been sucked dry by the series first two installments. It is unashamedly American with lots of senseless ""cartoon"" violence where characters get repeatedly bludgeoned, lacerated and pummeled yet magically never suffer any consequences all the way through and beyond the flag waving crescendo. All for the wonder of seeing the webbed crime-fighter do his thing in full CGI glory. It would be far more rewarding to see a Spiderman updated for our times and not one that is still stuck in 1950's moral values.Welcome new dark Spidey, the most entertaining by far. Now this guy gets things done. He just has to reign it in a little bit and use his powers with more discretion.Other than that the story lacks freshness. The entire Sandman character feels contrived, though Haden Church gives a great performance. As for Spiderman's other foe, equally so. It feels thin. The main dramatic plot point being a staff-job competition for the Bugle. Wow, talk about dated. Spidey's enemies have no creativity in this film and lack any real plan for world-domination-type thinking. They are small time. Leaving only one thing that's any fun, dark Spidey. Still not quite worth the price of admission though. However, thumbs up to Tobey for pulling it off so well.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Having already done tortured troubled evil , Dr Octopus, with whom th audience have sympathies, the company tries to go in a different direction by filling the screen with Spidies enemies in the hope of blockbuster success. It looks a WWF tag match1 There are so many evils here that when the climax comes th audience hasn't been able to build a rapport with any of them so why should we care about them or what happens to them? This is a lesson in more is less, to use the cliché, which what they have clearly used here more than once. The redeeming one is a character mad out of sand. A feat of CGI to make his metamorphosis look convincing and the only character around long enough for rth e audience to feel anything towards. But he is not developed like Doc Octupus's screen time and so the main redeeming baddie has as much impression as sandcastle left out in the rain.

This month will see, amongst several other quality releases, a trio of tri-quels from series that have each already produced two excellent, hugely successful releases. The competitions for viewersand especially second-time viewerswill be huge. Analysts have placed their bets. Fan-boys and fan-girls are wetting their pants. Box office records will likely be shattered.And it is amidst this level of hype that Spider-Man 3 swings onto the screen with a colossal thunk.Our worst nightmare is confirmed: the curse of the tri-quel strikes again. Spider-Man 2 was superior to the first in nearly every way except earnings. The action scenes were cooler. The emotional scenes hit harder. Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) came of age in spectacular fashion, descending through a dark valley of self-doubt and emerging to save the day, get the girl, and once again win our hearts.In Spider-Man 3, Spidey again descends into darknessif ""darkness"" can be defined by bad hair, black eyeliner, and hitting on everything with a pulse within fifty feet of himself.The convoluted, overstuffed, throw-everything-at-the-screen-and-hope-something-sticks plot goes something like this: When we last left our hero, he'd won the love of the fair Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and the gratitude of New York Citybut the hatred of his ex-buddy, disgruntled, alcoholic playboy Harry Osborn (James Franco).In the film's best sequenceconveniently already made available on the InternetHarry dons his daddy's Goblin suit and goes out to butcher his ol' buddy Pete. The first sign that something is going terribly wrong is when this results in Harry contracting amnesia, forgetting everything he's spent the last two movies getting pent up. (Wait, amnesia? Is this a Sam Raimi film, or General Hospital?) Meanwhile, in a series of deus ex machina that boggles the mind, a meteor containing a strange black substance crashes to Earthapparently on the outskirts of New York, seemingly unnoticed by anyone (including Peter and MJ, not a hundred yards away). At the same time, escaped murderer and petty-crook-with-a-heart Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church, impersonating a plank of wood) falls into an absurdly low-security particle accelerator and gets sandblasted into the Sandman.It's a superhero flickyou suspend your disbelief for this long. But then things just get silly. The black substance, it turns out, is symbiotic in nature, and it slowly begins to corrupt Spidey. Unfortunately, the ads lie. The black spider-suitfeatured in every posteris on screen for five minutes at most. Instead, director Raimi decides to focus on the slow degradation of Peter Parker's soulincluding the aforementioned eyeliner.This leads to one of the most laughable middle portions ever committed to screen, and certainly the most laughable ever given a $300 million budget. As brilliant as Tobey Maguire is at playing sweet, dorky Peter Parker, he can't do ""evil"". (""Evil"" Tobey was last seen raping Cate Blanchett in The Good German, another utterly ludicrous flick.) In a memorable shot, ""dark"" Peter stands in front of a mirror andgaspdrops a black forelock over his face, bearing a sudden eerie resemblance to Pete Wentz. If you thought Spidey went emo in the second film, you ain't seen nothing' yet. Maguire leaves the mask off, instead pompously (and unconvincingly) strutting around Manhattan, shooting leers at the girls, and, like he just dropped in from Flashdance, busts out his moves across a nightclub bar.Remember those couple very funny moments from Spider-Man 2the snooty usher, the goofy violinist, the creepy landlord's daughter? Raimi has seemingly decided that the best way for Spider-Man to match Shrek the Third at the box office is to take those foibles and use them for two-thirds of the film. While several of these gags are funny, their overuse means that when Spider-Man 3 tries to get serious, it completely falls apart and instead turns from being intentionally to unintentionally hilarious. An audience should not be giggling maniacally through a protagonist's deathbut they were in my theater.There's some random stuff thrown in too, most of which doesn't work. MJ sings two musical numbers, which are dull and unnecessaryas is her two-minute omelet-making routine (what?) with Harry. The scenes with Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) have lost all emotional punch. Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) and her father (James Cromwell) appear as unnecessary fan-service. The Sandman's action sequences are hit and miss. J.K. Simmons does manage to bring a little of the first two films back in yet another scene-stealing performance as Bugle editor J. Jonah Jameson.And then there's Venom (Topher Grace), also known as Peter's photographic rival Eddie Brock Jr.. If Venom had been saved for a fourth installment, given his own film a la the Green Goblin and Doc Ock, it would have likely been a thrilling success. Instead, Venom is an afterthought (the name ""Venom"" is actually never spoken in the film), appearing to inject a smidgen of life into the last segment of the film. Topher Grace plays the role with aplomb, easily overcoming his slight stature (Brock is heavyset and muscular in the comic series; this Venom seems to be inspired by the ""Ultimate"" continuity), and perfectly capturing the ordinary-guy-driven-to-hatred mentality. And he menaces a hundred times better than Maguire could dream of.But Venom is in the film too briefly to ever use his legendary teethand the film itself has none. People were filing out of the theater well before the last shot, and the ones who remained were jeering derisively at the screen. Raimi and Maguire's canny evasion as to whether a fourth film is in the works now becomes clear. It's not a good thing when the most enjoyable part of an audience's night was the first two minutes of Fracture coming on by mistake.BOTTOM LINE: Spider-Man 3 should spell the death of the series. Let's pray that Shrek the Third and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End hold up better than this piece of cinematic garbage. C-minus.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

There seems to be a bit of a pattern developing where movie makers seem to either try to fit too much into the time and end up not exploring any one topic or character well enough for you to care about the events presented, or else focus almost completely on the action to the detriment of story and character exploration so once again you don't care about the outcome.Some comic book movies DO manage to escape fully slipping into one or both of these categories eg. good characterisation and reasonable exploration of only a few core concepts in the X-men movies; and good characterisation in The Hulk - which only just manages to win out over the confused addition of an extra villain late in the game. Both of these however might have also seemed better due to the higher class of acting ability? I haven't decided yet.In any case, Spiderman 3 unfortunately seems to have a mix of both patterns and as such just didn't do it for me.Being that the Spiderman movies are about a single character, I would expect that character to be fleshed out well. X-men, as I mentioned, manages to explore a number of characters reasonably well, but as the Spiderman trilogy has progressed I feel that Peter Parker has become more wooden and prone to posturing about spouting lame catch cries mixed with out of character moments thrown in to advance the plot quickly (eg Gwen Stacey related events). I ceased to feel for his character and ended up getting irritated that he was whining all the time about how badly he had screwed up. In fact, he was either arrogant and pompous, taking himself too seriously, or a bit childish and whiny... All in all I ended up bored.The treatment of Peter Parker's character mirrored the style of the movie itself - it alternated between taking itself way too seriously with preachy speeches backed by music possibly intended to be inspirational, with American flags waving in the background :/ to weird scenes of the characters behaving in stupid ways (Peter Parker's dancing in the streets bit). All in all I could never tell if I was supposed to feel sorry for a character, hate them, like them, laugh at them or just not bother with in any of these. In the end that is the one I chose as it provided less confusion.I think my main problem with the movie, and with most comic adaptations that have been executed poorly (Daredevil *shudders*) is that I recognise the *potential* there was for a decent movie (given all the provided back stories) that was squandered by poorly written scripts/dialogue/plot. Given the potentially interesting nature of Venom and his origins, I wasn't quite sure why they had bothered including Sandman in the movie at all - it would have been much more coherent if Venom was the sole new character and had been given the attention he deserved. The unfortunate casting of Topher Grace (that 70s Show) in the role of Eddie Brock/Venom was another distraction that completely killed interest in the character for me.Anyway, the special effects were great as you might expect (the only reason I just managed to give this a 6/10), but the rest of the movie ended up so infuriating in parts that around 10 or 15 in a cinema of 300 walked out before the end. On my way out I heard murmurings from almost half the people I passed about how ""lame"" it was. I ended up apologising to my partner for even dragging her to see it. Maybe go see it if you're a fan, but be ready for some major disappointment. If I was able to get my money back at the end of the movie as a way of showing Hollywood studios that they are starting to get comic book movies WRONG I would. Now I'm not even sure if I should bother with the next Fantastic 4  Jessica Alba or not! :(","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The First two spider-man films were excellent in the views of storytelling, conflicts, action sequences...etc.now...with spider-man 3...i wouldn't go far describing bits and pieces of the film that are 'considered' stupid....i was trying to understand where this film was going as with the plot and comic 'funny' sequences. i just couldn't buy it....at least some of it. to be stereotypical on this one....what was up with Spiderman turning 'emo'? That thing with peter having his hair down...reminded me of a friend of mine who wears tight pants and gets picked on by stereotypes, sometimes reffered to as 'emo'. I don't know if the hair thing was used to illustrate Peter's 'evil-ness'...but it simply did not work for me. fast-forwarding to Venom...When the symbiote arrived from outer space in a comet or meteorite or whatever...i thought that was pretty random. Im guessing, for three villains in the film, they didn't have time to explain much...so i guess everything had to be squeezed and thrown in to this film. although the film was pretty long. With the de-molecularization of the sand man...I'm sure ""everyone knows exactly what de-molecularization is""overall....the action sequences were good. Sandman was enourmously impressive although some of the cgi looked absolutely pretty fake. The conflicts with Peter and Mary Jane were pretty shocking. Overall, its a fun movie to watch in the theater with a couple of friends or family. If you're a crazed movie expert fanatic or whatever, you'll probably notice these things...and hopefully does not ruin the experience of spider-man 3","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As he deals with new enemies and conflict with former friends,Spider-Man discovers a black entity that makes him behave very differently. Best Performance: J.K.

From the first to the second, you could definitely see a huge improvement. The special effects had improved, and the actors were comfortable in their characters by now, and the story just sucked me into the movie, wanting to see what happened next scene after scene. In the third installment of the Spier-Man series, I was not pulled into the movie at all. I didn't once feel anticipation, besides when i first walked into the theater. I kept looking at my watch wondering when it was finally going to be over.I felt as if the special effects had sunken back down to how they were in the first installment. but they got away with it because it was the first. By the third, they should be spectacular! The script seemed slow and poorly written. The actors had seemed to lose the fire they had built up in their characters in the second, given, that could also be a script problem. Tobey Maguire seemed a little different in Spidey's shoes, and Kirsten Dunst seemed uncomfortable with her character. And James Franco...lets just say he did not ""avenge"" Willem Dafoe's character very well.Some of the parts were good though, don't get me wrong. The beginning was good, and the ending was almost as spectacular as the action scenes in the second Spider-Man. New characters, Venom, Sandman and Gwen Stacey, are well portrayed by actors, Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace and Bryce Dallas Howard.I'd say this movie was average, not in the horrible section, but not on the must see list. Overall, I think this movie is just a disappointment to all the built up excitement many fans had.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Spiderman 1 was, to coin a phrase, amazing! Spiderman 2 was Spectacular! (better than amazing) Spiderman 3 however just didn't live up to the quality of the first two movies. I did like the film, but it just didn't go in the right direction for me. The first two followed the comic/animated series pretty loyally, but in the 3rd one, I think Rami and his brother decided to thrown in their own Hollywood plot twists that might end up leaving a lot of the more knowledgeable fans feeling a bit confused and alienated. Its hard to get into details without spoiling the plot, but lets just say that the story works, provided they follow it up with another 3 movies like the rumours have stated, and that they really go back to their comic book roots with the next films. If this is the finale to a trilogy however, I think there are going to be a lot of unhappy fan-boys (and girls) stomping on their Spiderman DVDs.I agree with what someone else said about the directors trying to cram too many characters into the story, but they could have made it work had they changed gears slightly. Again I will say that a lot of comic fans are going to be more than a bit upset when they find out how many times the characters in the movie completely ignore their own persona that they have in the comics... I guess the biggest let down is simply that the first two movies were spot on from a geek's perspective while still allowing new fans to understand everything that was going on whereas this movie didn't do the series justice in that respect.There are some absolutely incredible effects however, and Spiderman/Parker and Mary Jane hold pretty true to their characters... in fact it was mostly Hary and Venom that let me down.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film follows the story of Peter Parker, once again played by Tobey Maguire, as he continues to navigate the challenges of being a superhero while also dealing with new threats and personal struggles. The film also explores Peter's relationships with Mary Jane Watson, played by Kirsten Dunst, and Harry Osborn, played by James Franco, and his conflicts with the film's main antagonists, Sandman, played by Thomas Haden Church, and Venom, played by Topher Grace.One of the things that I enjoyed about the film was the performances by the lead actors, Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst had great chemistry as Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson, and their performances were engaging and brought depth to their characters. The visual effects used to create Spider-Man and the villains were also impressive and added to the overall enjoyment of the movie. The action scenes were also well-choreographed and provided some exciting moments.The movie's tempo, nevertheless, was inconsistent when compared to the first and second movies; certain sequences felt hurried, while others dragged on for too long. The movie's narrative was also a little bit muddled and featured an excessive number of subplots that seemed superfluous. Additionally, there was a lack of character chemistry, and several of the subplots seemed superfluous.Overall, Spider-Man 3 is a movie with some thrilling action sequences and eye-catching special effects. In contrast to the first and second movies, it lacks in tempo and story intricacy. Although the performances of Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst as Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson are notable, it is challenging to fully appreciate the movie due to its complicated narrative and jerky pacing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Scene at the church where Spider-man gets rid of the symbiote costume and Eddie Brock embraces it is stunning. You really couldn't ask for a better superhero movie. My brother is a huge batman fan and thought spider-man was a pussy. But when he Saw Spider-man 3 he took every thing back. This movie is a long 2hrs and 30 min but it is definitely worth it.

Wasn't heaps out, so settled on Spiderman 3, a movie I figured would be best viewed at the movies.Spiderman 3 picks up with MJ(Dunst) and Peter/Spiderman(Maguire) in love and all things are going great. Things get much better when early on Harry faces of with Spiderman and comes off second best, badly hitting his head which causes memory loss and for him to forget that Pete is Spiderman. Just when it seems life is perfect things take a nosedive. MJ's career is dealt a massive blow when she's dropped from her just released theatre show, a new photographer comes onto the scene at the Globe and a new enemy rises, Sandman. Soon Pete is going through a series of crisis's and things go worse when he is somehow dealt a black spidey suit, which takes over and makes him feel indestructible and overconfident.I won't go into much more detail, but Spiderman faces his biggest challenges ever in all facets of his life.The movie is OK, but things happen a little too conveniently, even for a superhero movie. The action is just too overdone and actually gets dizzying at times. Tends to drag at times as well. A great performance by Maguire, who carries the movie, with little support from Dunst who just has to portray two emotions- despair and sadness.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It seemed as if director Sam Raimi knew what he needed to accomplish but didn't know how to get there, and that's where the film fails miserably.The first example comes with Harry Osborne. His character is as cartoony as any character ever in the Spider-man universe. He has this anger towards Spider-man with no depth whatsoever. His anger is understandable but completely disregard the fact that he and Peter Parker were best friends for a really long time. Their confrontations seem more like two soap opera characters feuding. And in order to push Harry aside to introduce the other characters is mind-blowingly ridiculous! There are tons of other ways to get rid of a character rather than the way Raimi and his team chose to do it. Bringing him back includes one of the sappiest moments in superhero film history.You would think the black Spider-man plot would be dark and dramatic, but on the contrary; it's turned into a comedic subplot. You wouldn't know if you're watching The Mask or Spider-man during a big chunk of the movie, and I'm not even exaggerating. The whole symbiote idea seems uninspired. It's poorly introduced, which is very disappointing considering how they set up J.J's son coming back from space during the second film.Gwen Stacy is also uninteresting. She's the typical cliché of the damsel in distress with a character that seems like it came straight out of the movie Crash, having some sort of connection to quite a few characters in the film.The biggest problem is probably Sandman. You just can't understand that character. He's played out to be this nice guy who steals as a means to save his daughter, but ends up causing more destruction than any other foe in any Spider-man movie. It just doesn't make sense. The ends definitely don't justify the means.While Topher Grace as Eddie Brock is the best inclusion in this movie, he's still not anything worthwhile. He's another character whose ends don't justify the means. He has a reason to be upset at Peter Parker, but is it really enough to want to kill him? The film has it's good points, because it HAS to. It's a Spider-man movie. There's always going to be some enjoyment in that, but overall the film is sappy, unoriginal, campy, goofy, and disappointing.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

A lot of things in this movie flat out don't make sense. Is Peter Parker (some sort of physics genius) REALLY so stupid that he doesn't know how to listen to MJ when she's literally crying? There's too many bad guys thrown into this movie, and everyone is created from, uh-oh--! a science experiment gone wrong! So do people running nuclear experiments not notice ENORMOUS threats to their experiments, which are probably meticulously planned and executed and probably cost thousands per experiment? And if spiderman has to turn to the dark side (which he probably should, given how lily-white he is) why can't this be born out of his own internal struggles, rather than that creepy oil stuff? I also thought that could have been a lot more fun than uncombed hair and bad dancing--like when Christopher Reeve as Superman went bad. He was bad, but not over the top, or too comical not to be scary. And WHERE is the spidey-sense? Things in this movie frequently pop out of no where to attack spiderman, who appears to not have spideysense at all in this movie. Bottom line: more of the same, but not necessarily at the same level as the other two movies. The effects for the Sand man were pretty good, but the rest of the action is the same as we've already seen.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Too many characters and plot lines. Sam Raimi went all out on the awkwardness too. This movie isn't as bad as its detractors say it is, it's still a fun movie to watch and it's a nice conclusion to the original trilogy. Tobey Maguire also ramps up the goofiness of his character too. Topher Grace is kind of a weird choice for Venom. My favorite scene in the movie is the part where Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) wakes up after getting his powers. Great CGI there that still holds up. It looks kinda like something you'd see in an old Pixar short.Watch this one to wrap up the trilogy. Not Spidey's best big-screen adventure, but still worth a look, especially for the memes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Tobey Maguire reprises his role as the nerdy and shy Peter Parker, who has maintained a balance between his relationship with Mary-Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and his responsibility as Spider-Man. But, Peter has to deal with his vengeful friend Harry Obsourne (James Franco) and new foe the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church). He also must deal with the consequences of amplifying his powers, which inadvertently leads to his uniform changing colors to pitch black and the birth of another new foe called Venom.The acting was decent for the most part, but, I've found Bryce Dallas Howard's Gwen Stacy role as just an annoying distraction to the plot and James Franco's Harry Osbourne character having the personality of a soap opera. The special effects were unrealistic and too campy, including the Sandman CGI effects. There are still plenty of action to keep the story exciting, including the fight scenes between Spider-Man and Venom, and I thought the subplot about finding the truth behind Ben Parker's killing was pretty intriguing. But the overall plot dragged a little and the series did look like it was losing steam by the time this movie was made.Grade C","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There is brilliance. The animation of the birth of the sand creature is perhaps the best realistic animation I have ever seen on screen. It was sheer poetry, movie magic at its best.I really enjoyed swinging along with Peter between buildings in the first Spider Man movie. I did not get that enjoyment this time. The action was speeded up so much I felt an outsider watching machines zip about hyped up on some alien drug. It was all too fast to follow and too exaggerated to accept as real. I was no longer a participant, merely an observer.I am gay and this movie offers up acres of male eye candy. Topher Grace (aka Eric Forman) drops his nerd persona and plays an irresistibly sexy, evil character. James Franco looks like some 50s pop idol with a smile that could melt steel. Thomas Hayden Church is massive, hard and terrifying in his intensity.It is a metaphoric morality tale where evil, drugs, power are represented by a black, enveloping, alien life force. These black strands bestow power, euphoria and magnify character defects, just like drugs or war. I took the movie as a metaphor for the way the USA has become corrupted and needs to return to its old red-white-and-blue morality, not stooping to selfishness, sadism, gluttony and greed.There are four villains Spidy has to contend with, often ganging up on him. The movie dragged a bit for me. However, some of the scenes with the sand creature were so entrancing the rest of the movie was irrelevant. Later on in the movie, the animation was dreadful -- reminiscent of an old Godzilla movie. It was like seeing an old Vermeer painting touched up by Ronald McDonald.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Yes they were pretty convincing reasons, but it didn't destroy the whole film for me either. I enjoyed the action scenes, which is the main lead to enjoying an ""action"" film, the story was all right, even though it could have had less plot holes, the characters were decent enough, and it followed nicely with the comics.The villains could have been better though. Not that I didn't want them in there, they just could have been better developed. I was excited as heck when I found out that Venom was going to be in there. When I saw it in theaters, that was what I was looking forward to the entire film. Then when it finally got to him, I was utterly disappointed. 2 minutes and 30 seconds total screen time with Venom, not counting when he's got his face lashed back into Eddie Brock. And how much time do we get with the Sandman, like a lot more. Their screen time should have been switched. Heck, they could have done the film without Sandman. What was he needed for? Did they really need the subplot of Sandman really killing uncle Ben? I don't think so.The romantic struggle between Peter and Mary Jane, although a little stupid, still gets a lot of emotion put into the film. And the New Goblin, aka Harry, who loses his memory after an accident, forgets that he wants Peter dead, which regains his friendship with him.We also get introduced to the symbiote, who becomes attached to Peter's Spider-Man outfit, and slowly tortures him into insanity, turning him from a pathetic nerd to a ruthless emo person. The two dumbest things in this film are emo Peter, and the dance scene.Emo Peter is supposed to be tortured by the suit, yet he's hopelessly addicted to it. Yet soon after he gets it, a montage of him walking around the street acting goofy to each girl that comes by, is just plain silly. The dance scene is the worst. A scene where we jumps around a jazz club, swinging on lamps and sliding on chairs. It looks like a deleted scene from the movie Chicago. Its hard to see the pain he goes through when he's jumping around dancing. The scene did not have to be that silly, nor did the Emo Peter scene have to be.Still though, the action was great, the characters and dialogue went well, the emotion throughout the entire film is just great, and it follows through with the comics almost perfectly. Although they could have had a lot more Venom time, and a lot less plot holes, it still holds out as a perfectly good comic book based film. Despite it being the worst of the series, its still a watchable film that I can see anytime.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Being a fan of the first one and disappointed in the second, I had high hopes for this one ... especially knowing Venom and Sandman would be battling Spidey! Director Sam Raimi (responsible for all three and possibly a fourth Spider-Man movie) turns this one into every bit the mess that Sandman is as he is washed out through the sewer system. Too bad the movie can't resurrect itself. Three good things: the black suit, the first few scenes of Sandman and the great Bruce Campbell. The bad things: pretty much everything else ... except a couple of scenes with Elizabeth Banks and an almost unrecognizable Theresa Russell (as Sandman's wife).Tobey Maguire just doesn't have the chops to pull off ""tough guy"" Spider-Man. Raimi knew this and tried to instill much slapstick. Instead, we just get a failed SNL skit. Maguire has the nerdy Peter Parker down, but his Wes Bentley look flops big time. Kirsten Dunst continues to flaunt the worst hair of any female movie star and is in jeopardy of having her potentially huge career as a real actress pass her right by. James Franco is his usual bland ""little Goblin"".New bad guys include Thomas Haden Church (""Sideways"") as Sandman and Topher Grace (""That 70's Show"") as Venom. Church is very good, Grace is horrible. Ron Howard's daughter Bryce Dallas Howard is one of several excesses in the film, but it is nice to catch a quick glimpse of Willem Dafoe and an actual speaking role for creator Stan Lee.By far the funniest part of the film is Bruce Campbell as the French Maitre d' trying so hard to make the evening romantic for Parker and Mary Jane. The best special effects are the first few scenes of Sandman. Most of the other special effects are way over the top and lose their effectiveness.My absolute biggest complaint is the fact that every major character weeps like a baby at some point. Super heroes and villains shouldn't be weeping!! The amount of emotional junk included in the script is boring, poorly written and horribly executed. This gives the film a dragged out feeling and easily adds 25 unnecessary minutes to the film. Is it fun to watch? The action scenes definitely are. Is it a classic. Absolutely not. Please, Mr. Raimi, let the franchise rest in peace.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It had a colorful look, with spirit and energy. Then came ""Spider-Man 2,"" the best sequel, and the best superhero film, about a troubled hero choosing between life as Spider-Man or as Peter Parker. Walking out of ""Spider-Man 2"" left me fulfilled and with a smile on my face and I immediately started counting the days until the release of ""Spider-Man 3,"" and couldn't wait until May 4th arrived. Finally, Friday May 4th, 12:00am. In line for two hours pumped and excited, watched through it, and was it worth it? Yes, but not what I expected. There were some good and some bad. The great part about the film was obviously the jaw-dropping action sequences, which gave me goose bumps just watching Spidey go into action, saving Mary Jane and fighting the villains, especially the final battle scene where it was a two on two battle with Spidey and Harry, and Venom and Sandman. The visual effects were put to great use, and should earn an Academy Award nomination. The CGI and stunt folks do such a brilliant job of creating monsters and smashing buildings and crashing cars that we almost take it for granted. The symbiote looked fabulous, it was a puddle of goo into something aggressive. One thing that impressed me the most was how Alvin Sargent's script was able to juggle so many characters and make them relevant, ""Batman Forever"" this is not! However there are some cons. There was no point of Gwen Stacy. She just comes and goes. There are some very cheesy moments in the film. Maguire tries hard, but Peter's boyish enthusiasm seems more like annoying dork with just a better suit at this point - and when Spidey goes dark, there's none of the menace or inner turmoil of, say, Christian Bale's Batman. At one point Peter Parker undergoes a personality and style makeover that makes him look and act like he's the unknown third brother from ""A Night at the Roxbury,"" making a scene at the jazz club, and for a second, I forgot what I was watching. Did I mention Kirsten Dunst singing more than once? There are far too many sluggish scenes of Peter and Mary Jane and don't even get me started on Harry's butler, who makes a speech late in the film that could have saved a lot of people a lot of trouble if he had just said something earlier! Thomas Haden Church gives an excellent portrayal as Sandman. In this film the script gives Sandman a real great story and should have been the main antagonist along with Harry. I was enormously disappointed with Venom, and yes, I am a fan of the character. Topher Grace gave a right performance, but there was no point to Venom in the film. He just comes and goes; such a waste of a character. Venom's design looked awesome and cool with the webbing's and just the way how his appearance was, but he and Spidey didn't go one on one, they just fought very briefly, and plus Venom didn't have much dialog. Overall, ""Spider-Man 3"" doesn't entirely flatten the franchise. I walked out partly satisfied, but kinda disappointed. It's a fun candy-eye popcorn adventure comic book flick, ""3"" doesn't live up to the first two films, however it's worth the price and there's plenty to enjoy, and comfortable to sit through. 7/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

A lot of people are nailing this movie for trying to put to much in one movie which I can understand BUT...I believe that is was executed well. The only lecture I have for this movie is the lacked storyline of Venom but you can get that if you read the comics. This movie in my opinion topped the other two because of better character performances by actor's Kirsten Dunst and especially James Franco who delivered an award winning performance for supporting actor in my opinion. He nailed the ""you don't deserve my help"" line.Tobey Maguire does a great job once again Thomas Haden-Church bulks up with good acting and the unexpected great performance by that ""blonde pretty boy"" who was better than expected and he's also great in Predators. Also this movie was the first to feature a villain that wasn't just dressed in armor actually it featured two unhuman like villains. This movie makes you cheer,laugh and also makes you a little sad at the end. Top 10 movie for me. The reboot to me sounds like a dumb move to close to the other three. There should have been a fourth I thought but i've been wrong before...let's hope for the best Garfield!!!","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The first 2 where very good movies so when Spiderman 3 was announced I couldn't wait for it to premiere.When I first saw the teaser trailer summer of 2006 I was ecstatic. Then after watching the new full trailers I was even more excited, it looked so good. I loved the idea of Venom as the baddie. I was telling people days before the movie came out how it was gonna be the best movie ever. Then Friday night I saw it. And was bitterly disappointed. First of all the special effects were awesome especially Venom and Sandman. Unfortunately just about everything else that made the first 2 shine weren't in this movie. Tobey was given horrible, campy lines as Peter Parker and the whole dark side, a good idea in theory was ruined by bad dialog. Even what happened between him and Harry just wasn't as good as the trailers made it out to be. Venom was under developed and wasn't scary or bad enough as he should have been.This movie was a perfect example of over hype. Sadly the spiderman I loved was not this movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This suit was great that Venom was wearing but they shouldn't have revealed his human so much. The point is to show how scary Venom is and he was portrayed as a weak person. As far I am concerned everyone loves Venom even if he is a villain but this movie did him so justice. There was too many lovey dovey sad scenes when there should have been more action between Spiderman and the villains.

The gratuitous hero shot with Spiderman swinging in front of a full screen shot of the American flag made me laugh out loud. This is a kid's movie, except that they also put in vicious violence and we see Spiderman hit in the face with a metal pipe among other things.

"6","/10","The third isn't bad, but it's time to end the series now","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1685123/?ref_=tt_urv","Listen_to_the_Law","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15016779/?ref_=tt_urv","2 July 2007","Spider-man 3 has shattered the box office record previously held by Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest for highest-grossing opening weekend ever, taking in $151 million compared to Pirate's $135.6 million last July. Although never poor movies, the Spider-man series always seems like the least deserving of the super-hero movies to garner such money. The drawing points of the Spider-man flicks has always been the web-action, but why market a movie on that when the bulk of it is spent with this love story trash between Peter Parker (McGuire) and Mary Jane Watson (Dunst)?At the beginning, Peter is chatting it up with Mary Jane, and their chemistry appears to be better than ever. However good the acting may be, the love angle still sucks. Anyway, Peter later tells Aunt May (Rosemary Harris- good actress, wrong movie) about his plans, so once they open their mouths, they quickly kill any hope of the movie picking up. For a few brief seconds, we get to witness Spiderman swinging across town, and he even gets into a mediocre battle with the New Goblin. The New Goblin is Harry Osborn (James Franco), the original Goblin's son. Spiderman's battles seem to be sequences to enhance the real plot of the story. Now of course, Spiderman is human, so Peter Parker can't just fly around all day- he has to bring in money to keep a good living. Peter works at the Daily Bugle, an ignorantly-titled and fictional New York newspaper. Making a return is Mr. Jameson, the manager of the Daily Bugle. He looks, acts, and sounds like Vince McMahon, and is the man who he always has been, ordering his minions around with ego-driven orders. As you can guess, his character is a laugh-riot, and most of that is because of his witty temper. Jameson hired Peter Parker, yet he doesn't know that Spiderman is his alter-ego. And Jameson hates Spiderman. Anyways, like every make-believe work office, there is competition. Eddie Brock is a photographer, just like Peter Parker. Eddie Brock is played by Topher Grace, who is known to everyone as Eric Foreman from That 70s Show. They feud from the get-to, and are each assigned to snap cool pictures of Spiderman. After Parker dispatches Brock after catching him cheating by making up pictures of Spiderman, Brock gets his revenge by being Venom. Yes, that's correct: Eric Foreman is Venom!Now, I could talk more about the story, but for two reasons I wont. One, I don't necessarily spoil movies when I review them. Two, I will dive into a hostel pool of negativity. I don't feel like being negative right now, but if you honestly want to know what happens in the rest of the story, expect to see too much of Peter Parker, including an emo-punk side. Too much of Parker equals not enough Spiderman. Not enough Spiderman equals a lack of other interesting characters, such as Sandman (a shape-shifting man made of sand), Venom, and even the New Goblin. The reason as to why there should be more time on these characters is because of just how cool they are: Sandman grows in size and is one hell of a special effect. Venom has perhaps one of the coolest spandex-like suits ever seen in a superhero movie. And for the first time ever, Harry Osborn grows to be a character who isn't annoying. But then there's that unexplained black stuff.Here's the bottom line: Spider-man 3 is not a bad film; it's a good film with many misjudgments. All of the main actors seem to have picked it up, the newcomers did a respectable job, favorites like JJJ returned, and we still got to see some cool web action. On the other hand, way too much time is spent on non-superhero activities, Peter Parker's troubles (who pays money to see a geeky young male adult struggle through his love life?), andBroadway musicals? In a superhero movie? I think not.Good) Sandman, Venom, New Goblin, Mr. JamesonBad) Peter Parker, the entire middle of the movie, not enough time spent on the villains May25th) If you haven't seen Spiderman 3 by that date, you can completely forget about it","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Putting two villains in one movie is already a bad idea. I wished Sam Raimi could've do his own version of the movie without Venom but no the studios unfortunately forced him to include Venom. The poor guy couldn't do the movie the way he wanted. Oh well. But to be honest, I don't hate this movie as much as people do. I don't think it's a thumbs down movie, but it could've been so much better. I love Tobey Maguire and find the guy so funny. I am so GLAD he is returning. So because his performance I quite enjoy this movie.I think it is watchable and the action is good enough. I never enjoyed the MCU as a lot of people did so I like revisiting these Sam Raimi Spider-Man movies. But compared to the first two ones this is really disappointing. The Venom stuff are really unnecessary and bad. Though I really do liked the Sandman stuff. And of course who could forget ""Bully Maguire"".

I completely agree that Spider-Man is a superhero and superheroes don't dance. It is completely unnecessary and is a big zero to the film even though it was sort of hilarious. However if they did not have him dance in the movie, I think it could have been a lot better and I think people could have like it better as well. This is a very mixed bag to say the least. However, I don't think having too many things is a bad thing because when you have more stuff going on it makes it more watchable. In Spider-Man 2, barely anything was going on and it was so boring to watch. In this one a lot of things are going and that is why I still liked Spider-Man 3 for what it was. The special effects are still outstanding as ever. I like the theme forgiveness in this movie and it anchors the film. I thought the cast is great. Kirsten Dunst is still good as Mary Jane. Thomas Haden Church is great as Sandman and I liked the subplot with that character. The CGI Sandman and the fight scenes between him and Spider-Man are awesome. I thought James Franco and Topher Grace stole the show. The conflict between Peter and Harry still works in the film. Franco helps anchor the film. Topher Grace as Eddie Brock fit perfectly as opposite Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker and did a good job. A lot of people were disappointed with Venom and I was too but I also thought that it was awesome when Venom appeared in the movie but was not the real Venom I was expecting. I liked Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy but was completely underused here. Tobey Maguire has some great moments and tries very hard. I enjoy watching him sometimes and liked his evil Peter Parker moments, but he is just annoying and was ridiculous with his punk hair. I also thought he was too nerdy and took spider man as a celebrity way too far. The climax of the movie: They did a great job of setting up the climax and it was awesome seeing venom fight spider-man for the first time as well as fighting Sandman at the same time as well. It became exciting as it went on. I love the set up: Spider-Man and New Goblin vs. Sandman and Venom; perfect. But it started looking like a cartoon and was disappointing. Venom did not look like Venom anymore and they should have came up with something better with the Spider-Man and Sandman ending. But it was still overall satisfying. Also, J.K. Simmons is still perfect and hilarious as J. Jonah Jameson.The fight scenes, action sequences and special effects are even better than the previous films but it still looked like a cartoon. The cast makes it happen and I like that there was more plot lines and characters. But the dance scenes ruined the movie and Venom had barely any screen time. Maguire has great moments but is annoying and does too much.This is a mixed bag. Spider-Man 3 is good but it is disappointing that it is just good because good is not good enough for a huge event movie like this. Has great moments but also has sluggish moments as well.I still liked it for what it was. It just could have been great.Overall: 7.5/10","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The seriousness of the second Spiderman was enthralling, and the third Spiderman movie was just disappointing. Let's hope that Batman continues its momentum and doesn't end the way of Spiderman.The main complaint is the movie is too long and jumps around way too much. The relationship between Peter Parker/Spiderman (Tobey MacGuire) and Harry Osborn/Young Goblin (James Franco) is so erratic it's like watching a tennis match. They are trying to kill each other, they are friends, they are trying to kill each other, they are friends etc. It was exhausting keeping up with it.Also, the scene where Peter Parker becomes the 'black Spiderman' is very distracting. I know it's vital to the story but how the director composed it was bad. There's 1970s pimp music as Peter walks down the street and watching Tobey MacGuire trying to act like a pimp and cool cat was so hilarious and awkward it took me out of the movie.I just felt the movie tried to accomplish too much. I am not a fan of the comic books and I could tell the writers had a hard time concluding this series. There are hundreds of stories of Spiderman how do you condense it down to three films? I certainly understand the dilemma but the screenwriters and producers came empty with this film.The special effects were certainly visually appealing but the story was a major let down to the previous two. Sorry Spidey, let's hope the franchise ends with this film.6 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was impressed by the 1 in two aspects,one is the scene that in and out of the bank. It was something simple but come out complicated. The second is the end. There seemed so many feelings complicated between the two people. Three days ago I saw 3 in Shenyang, China. It was sure fun though I thought it a pop corn in the theater ,but the kind of feelings was not so strong as to feel bored and tired like the ""superman returns"" and so on. Last year I saw too many such kind of movies at a close period of time in the theater including ""superman returns"". I can't say that was a good feeling. The 3 was not so impressing as 1, but it is still quite a good film. But the greatest parts I think , maybe Thomas Haden Church and Topher Grace. The former was excellent in his acting though he had not so much show, and the latter was cool.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Terrific way to start the summer, but overall very disappointing after watching it a second time.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1647246/?ref_=tt_urv","dvc5159","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3798706/?ref_=tt_urv","1 May 2007","This, is perhaps, the worst of the Spider-Man movies thus far. And this film has many reasons to show so. Such a reason is that it is crammed full of characters and irrelevant subplots like a pack of sardines, the and also characters become overly emotionally driven. Another thing is that we get to see Spidey fight THREE super villains, but the fights itself are abrupt. The story is a shattered mess and it feels forcibly rushed.This can be considered as Sam Raimi's most expensive film by far, in my opinion. In fact, it was because he directed all three Spider-Man films that the franchise was able to survive. He has heart and soul while working behind the camera, but his and his brother's screenplay just did not make the cut. He's hardworking, though. Usually, directors often quit after the second film when making a superhero film. Such as the case of the horrendous Batman film franchise (before the fantastic Batman Begins). I will look forward to seeing Spider-Man 4, if there will be one.Special effects are the only things that are praised here. Scott Stotdyk does an incredible job with keeping the special effects, and it seems that he may be good enough like John Dykstra, who won Spider-Man 2 an Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and left the third to do the much anticipated live action adaptation of the popular children's toy series Hot Wheels.Here, all the familiar faces do their job like in the first, with comments for Maguire and Franco for playing their characters in a slightly unusual style. However, the best acting here goes to Thomas Haden Church, who steals the show as Flint Marko a.k.a. Sandman, whose crime involving the death of Peter's Uncle Ben has a motive behind it, and so his character is understandable.Judging from the plot outline above, one can't help but feel whether this film will get complicated in a way, with all the happenings in it. Fear, for the complicated plot is what keeps this film from being a worthy entry in the series, and that's what's crappy about it.As I said in the beginning of this review, what a great way to start the summer. Watch it in the cinema once (recommended), but do not bother getting the DVD unless you're a die-hard fan.It should have ended with 2.5.6/10","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Definitely has some entertainment value, but overall, a bit of a bland third installment","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1795727/?ref_=tt_urv","Beta_Gallinger","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15711750/?ref_=tt_urv","7 January 2008","Unlike the previous two Spider-Man films, I did not see this one on the big screen. In fact, I didn't see any movies in theatres last year, other than ""The Simpsons Movie"". I finally just got around to renting ""Spider-Man 3"" after New Year's. Looking here on IMDb before watching it, it seemed to be polarizing, not as highly praised as the previous two installments, so I watched it with mixed expectations. Since it turned out to be sort of a mixed blessing, I guess I'm glad I had those expectations.At the moment, Peter is very happy. His life as Spider-Man is no longer interfering with his life as Peter Parker. However, one problem still unsolved is Harry still believes that Spider-Man killed his father, and now knows that Peter is Spider-Man! Peter's former best friend gets new powers, a lot like the ones that possessed his father, and becomes the New Goblin! In a battle between Peter and Harry, Harry falls and has to be hospitalized. While suffering from short-term memory loss, he remembers Peter as his friend again, but will his recent memories come back? Meanwhile, Flint Marko, who unbeknownst to Peter is Uncle Ben's real assassin, has escaped from prison! While running from the police, Flint becomes the Sandman, a new enemy for Spidey! Sadly, Peter's problems don't end there, as one night, he is possessed by a symbiote, one which makes him more powerful, but also makes him lose self control and become more aggressive! Watching ""Spider-Man 3"" once, I noticed more flaws in it than I ever have in its two predecessors, and I have seen both of them several times. First off, Harry's attack on Peter begins a bit too suddenly. Peter is riding his motorcycle, and Harry (as the New Goblin) just suddenly appears and immediately grabs him. It probably should have shown Harry coming first. Right now, it sounds like I'm making way too big a deal out of a minor problem, but there are more. One ridiculous part is where Peter kisses Gwen Stacy while in his suit at a ceremony in Spider-Man's honour. This is while he is thinking about proposing to Mary-Jane! Why wouldn't he realize that this wasn't going to help their relationship? When Peter becomes possessed by the symbiote, he can't help but become a total jerk, but sometimes, it gets pretty silly, especially the part where Mary-Jane is trying to perform, and Peter interrupts by doing dance moves, apparently trying impress her, even though he's with another date.Fortunately, this third ""Spider-Man"" movie does have some redeeming qualities, including some good action and excitement (as one would hope for), though there could have been more, and I would say the climax is quite good. In the humour department, there is one major highlight, which is the scene where J. Jonah Jameson is at his desk, and the loud buzzer keeps going off, shaking the desk and knocking stuff around. This part is probably funnier than anything in the first two films. There are some other funny scenes (not as funny as the one I mentioned, mind you), though the movie sometimes gets so cheesy that it may succumb to unintentional humour, which reminds me of ""Power Rangers"". In my book, the redeeming qualities of ""Spider-Man 3"" earn it a 6/10, but the downsides earn it nothing higher than that. Apparently, ""Spider-Man 4"" has been confirmed. Hopefully, it will be better than this one, but there's a good chance it won't be (you know how sequels go).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Read the comics, grew up with the cartoon (90's), wore Spidey jammies growing up, poster's and merchandise EVERYWHERE! I know Spider-Man! The first two films were perfect, as is this one! The story is flawless! Sam Raimi doesn't miss a beat concerning the storyline based from the comics. Acting by Tobey and Kirsten is perfect, absolutely perfect! Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko aka William Baker aka The Sandman, James Franco as Harry Osborn/Goblin 2, and Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom, are all portrayed PERFECTLY! The film is FAR more successful than Superman Returns (which was an utter failure.) Spider-Man 3, if you have seen the first two, is worth seeing. Oh, Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy is flawless too! Kirsten Dunst sang in this movie. It's her voice, nothing was lipsynched or fake. This (along with the first two, and Batman Begins.) Is flawless!! There is nothing wrong with this film concnering: acting, storyline, visuals, action, etc. THIS is the movie of 2007!!!

A hero conquers because of their own personal transformation.But what a tangled web we weave when first we try to write a decent plot line.The first 2 spider movies had a single enemy against with spiderman battled. The heroes were more believable, they are almost possible. In SM3 the bad guys are less believable, and there more of them. Which means we don't really get to know them, understand, or see them as human beings, who villainy is partly created by an imbalance.Here we see so many different plot elements, many lifted from the older spider man movies, that it gets a little bit boring after a while.Some interesting aspects are in this movie, is the black suited alien symbiont spiderman is like the batman of batman returns. Cool, Strong, powerful, angry and looking for revenge and ultimately negative.The Sandman is a person in the wrong situation, a person you never wanted to become what he is. He can only be defeated by words and reason.There is more here, but maybe too much more.Ultimately the movie missing it's mark when it comes to humour, fails to develop characters enough, is unbelievable in too many aspects of the movie, too many reversals in characters that leave your head spinning and worse yet, the ending is unsatisfying. It is the failure of the ending that really makes the movie hurt.Good try, entertaining enough, not a waste of 2 hours, but put it behind various other better titles.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Early on, Peter Parker is watching his girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson on stage singing some God awful musical number and being close to tears over her performance. I was ready to strangle Mary Jane. Her part, played by an extremely annoying Kirsten Dunst pretty much ruins this third chapter of Spidey's adventures.Now the good, starting with a cool villain called the sandman, Thomas Haden Church, whose shape shifting ability is a fun device.Willem Dafoe is back as the green goblin, and his son Harry(James Franco) also returns as the new goblin and both actors are excellent. Spidey 3 is too much Dunst who brings the whole thing down, I hope Raimi has the good sense to shrink her screen time for number 4.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Kirsten Dunst even i don't like so its pretty hard for me to say this was that one leg that held this tripod together.Now the fourth problem!Dialog,dialog,dialog!Dialog was between the top five worst dialogs ever.I don't get it,how can so expensive movie be this bad when it comes to that matter.The characters in this movie are really speaking things that have no sense.I could speak about why is this movie so bad the whole day but i really just want to forget about it.

It takes the story seriously while also being fun. Venom was not perfect I agree. It was a fun movie and because of some people we didn't get 4th Raimi movie which is sad.

But with both the symbiote, Harry Osborn and Sandman, the movie seemed rather contrived and could easily have been split up into two movies. But even if it all seemed contrived and underdeveloped, the ending still made me feel something.But how the writers handled the symbiote was pretty stupid. It's feeding on its host's negative emotions like anger, desperation and sadness and doesn't make people act like hotshots and do lame dance moves in doorways. That was the biggest let-down and wasn't really saved by Eddie Brock's bonding, because of some out-of-character lines that took the menace away from him.But at least it's better than the train-wreck of a movie which shed disgrace on the character of Venom in 2018.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Everyone in the movie cries even Venom and the Sandman. The Special effects were pretty cool, but I'm not able to turn my brain off to the bad plot and the bad acting. The movie is about 2.5 hours to long, 2.5 hours of my life that'll I'll never have back.

I'd say that the original was the best.In this movie, new dynamics are added when goo from outer space lands on Earth, and affects Spider-man, amongst others, giving them variations to their power, which complicates their relations to others.A new villain with super powers is also created due to an accident.Of course, the special effects are excellent and one of the newly created super-villains is particularly spectacular.However, what makes the movie so disappointing is the fact that it seems written by small boys, for small boys. The most cringe-worthy parts are when Spider-man is affected by the space-goo, and his alter-ego too, Peter Parker. The scene where Peter Parker does a variation of Tony Manero (from Saturday Night Fever) is cringe-worthy. Other parts of the movie, where loose ends are tied up are also boy-like in execution.I know I may be too old for this kind of stuff...I just wish that the script was more sophisticated as well as the way the plot plays out.Kirsten Dunst, as Parker/Spider-man's girlfriend, has some perhaps ironic new dimensions to her relationship with Parker. I can sympathise with what the makers of the movie were trying to achieve, but I do think they could have done it better.In the same way that the second Matrix movie SHOULD have warned me off bothering to see the third in the series, this movie MAY signal that the makers are flogging a dead horse now.The embarrassing parts of the movie are what I take away from it, mostly. But yeah, the special effects are really good.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"4","/10","What a Tangled Web Raimi Weaves...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1671816/?ref_=tt_urv","EUyeshima","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3608743/?ref_=tt_urv","10 June 2007","The epic hubris displayed by director Sam Raimi in this latest (and one would hope final) installment of his phenomenally successful Spider-Man series is what frustrates me the most about this overlong, CGI-saturated 2007 movie. It feels like he was given free reign to do whatever he wanted without the intrusion of common sense. The result is a megalomaniacal failure leavened by scattered moments of levity. Written by Raimi, along with his brother Ivan and veteran screenwriter Alvin Sargent, the story begins promisingly with Peter Parker, a.k.a. Spider-Man, regaling in his celebrity status and mustering up enough courage up to propose to longtime love Mary-Jane Watson, who is incredibly making her Broadway musical debut.The film wastes little time in establishing that Peter's ego has run amok - obviously an ironic parallel to Raimi's situation - and that he will be forced to face a crisis of conscience amid the shenanigans of not one but three villains. Spelling out the motivations of each of these characters takes time, as does the resuscitation of the love triangle between Peter, Mary-Jane and Harry Osborn and Peter's guilt over how he responded to his Uncle Ben's murder. Consequently, the movie feels overstuffed by the multiple story lines that only coalesce through pat plot conventions executed toward the end in order for the movie to have an acceptable running time. Moreover, the novelty of the special effects has tangibly worn out since the initial outing, and there is a surprising technical laziness found in some of the action sequences, especially with the overuse of nighttime shots to camouflage some of the battles.A key problem also lies in the divergent yet predictable ways the villains have been developed. The resuscitated Green Goblin represents the result of revenge, while Flint Marko is a petty criminal caught in a radiation field that turns him into Sandman, a burgeoning creature made of sand (probably the film's best CGI sequence). The most skimpily developed villain is Venom, a gloopy, fast-moving black parasite that takes hold of Peter first before it takes control of professional rival Eddie Brock. If this was not enough, the story also introduces another key female character, model Gwen Stacy who happens to be the daughter of the police chief and Mary-Jane's competition for Peter's affections. All these detours serve to bring Peter to his original sensibilities about being Spider-Man and of course, to the big climactic battle. This is perhaps the most disappointing portion of the movie as at least two far-fetched plot points undermine the dramatic tension and seem to emphasize the silliness of the entire venture.In keeping with its comic book origins, Raimi infuses the movie with a sense of humor, but the resulting variability in tone threatens to submerge the movie into camp. The principal actors - Tobey Maguire as Peter, Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane and James Franco as Harry - are back but give us little additional depth or texture to their characters. Broadway luminary Rosemary Harris is also back lending sage advice as Aunt May, as are J.K. Simmons as blowhard editor J. Jonah Jameson, Elizabeth Banks as saucy Miss Brant and Dylan Baker as the all-knowing Dr. Connors. Thomas Haden Church plays Marko stoically, while Topher Grace is simply irritating as the obnoxious Brock. Bryce Dallas Howard lends the right vacuity to air-headed Gwen, while Theresa Russell is wasted in a cameo as Marko's defeated wife. This is one dismal blockbuster worth skipping.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"6","/10","An Extreme Let Down From Its Predecessors","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3466764/?ref_=tt_urv","nmholland","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur62906690/?ref_=tt_urv","9 May 2016","Spiderman 3 is directed by Sam Raimi and is the final installment of the Raimi Spiderman trilogy, after Spiderman (2002) and Spiderman 2 (2004). Now that nerdy college kid Peter Parker has got the girl, he can focus solely on being Spiderman during the day, rather than having to deal with girl drama, right? Well, when three (yes, three) new villains come to town, he must put aside his relationship with Mary Jane and fight Venom, Sandman, and Green Goblin number 2.The above paragraph sounds confusing and partly inconceivable, and that's pretty much how this whole film was. Spiderman 3 was an absolute mess, relying just on the nostalgia of fanboys to carry it. Not much was going for this film, but, to its credit, what was going for it was really good, such as direction and special effects. However, an overabundance of characters and subplots, a bad script, and some very poor acting pulled this movie way below the bar.The thing that surprised me the most about Spiderman 3 is Tobey Maguire's acting. All throughout the first two Spiderman films, Tobey Maguire was great as both Peter Parker and Spidey. However, Maguire's acting abilities in Spiderman 3 were just not present. In this installment, Maguire had to play Peter, ""bad"" Peter, Spiderman, and ""bad"" Spiderman, and he just couldn't handle it. It pains me to say that Tobey Maguire's acting in this film was less than mediocre, and he could've done way better, to say the least.Not much of the other actors did that great either. Both Kirsten Dunst and James Franco as Mary Jane and Harry Osborn play their same old selves, with not much going for them. As seen in the end of Spiderman 2 (2004), Harry has taken up his father's legacy of the Green Goblin, so he has a new dark side to him. However, Franco doesn't pull this off at all. His ""dark side"" is more a whiny brat not willing to listen to reason about the truth of his father's death, and it got excessively annoying. Kirsten Dunst doesn't bring anything new or special to the character of MJ, and Topher Grace was probably the best actor throughout the entire film, playing Peter's competitor at work, Eddie Brock.The direction and special effects are really good, to be completely honest. Sam Raimi once again does great behind the camera, and uses his skill to film clean, nice looking action sequences. The special effects in Spiderman 3 are even slightly better than that in the first two films, which is impressive, considering how good those effects were. This may be due to Spiderman 3's bigger budget, but it still is a nice thing to see in an overall boring movie.The tiring amount of villains is really what hit this film hard. Although the audience may understand the motives and actions of Goblin, Sandman, and Venom, their characters aren't greatly developed. Sandman is just trying to collect money to help his sick daughter, which is nice and all, but his subplot changes a sturdy event that occurred in Spiderman (2002), which was a bad move on the script's part. Venom was quickly shoehorned in during the last act of the film, and his character was overall boring and quite dull. Goblin's motives were easily changeable, which took away from the character a lot. The script was also pretty bad. The entire film has some awful dialogue, and jumps around often. The abundance of subplots is very bad for the film, and screws it over in unimaginable ways. Many lines were either cheesy, or just horrible, and, without good line delivery from the actors, the script ends up being a convoluted mess, too heavily relying on characters and actors to carry the film, which just didn't happen.In conclusion, Spiderman 3 isn't completely terrible, it just is an extreme let down from the amazing heights presented in the first two installments. With poor acting, characters, and a bad script, I'd recommend Spiderman 3 to anyone who enjoys superhero (or Marvel) movies, as long as you prepare yourself for a mess before hand.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They are already a couple but it seems that the writers want it to become complicated with Gwen coming to the picture.

I won't give anything away, but let me say this. Spider-man (1) was one of the best movies ever made. It fully explored all aspects of what Spidey should be, even though it's not entirely true to the comics, but what is? Sider-man 2 had more holes in it although the action sequences were better, not as good of a movie as 1 because of more holes in the plot. Most people seem to forget about the holes in the movie and praise it as better than one. In my opinion this is a mistake. Now that you know about my feelings of 1 and 2, i will tell you my thoughts of 3. Tobey and Kirstin both felt wrong. They both felt as if they had gotten sick of their roles and were waiting for something new. They have lost any passion they might have had for their roles. The special effects were unbelievable, literally. The physics of some of the scenes didn't add up. I will say this. Topher Grace did an excellent job. The portrayal of his character of Eddie Brock was dead on, and gave a refreshing breath of air to a seemingly dying series of movies. If they can find a way to bring him in to the next film, I will see it just for him. one last comment. Having so many villains with intertwining story lines made the movie long and complex. If you didn't know at least a little of the storyline of spider-man from the comics it is conceivable for you to get lost in this movie. However, the fight scenes are incredible and almost faster than the eye can see. It is worth seeing this movie for this alone. Overall I gave it a 7, 2 gets an 8, and 1 gets a 10 for being one of the best movies ever made.

It has it cornball moments, its overflowing story lines, and a terrible montage sequence. Not all the villains work. Harry loses his memory and becomes the cornball of cornballs. Mary Jane fails to tell Peter about why she is truly depressed, making you want to slap her. The last fight sequence was a disappointment. Yet it is only upon reflection when you can say such things. This is my Spidey 3 review, take 4.The first time I watched the movie, I was so absorbed, and it fulfilled everything I had hoped for (aside from the montage sequence). But as time passed by, I began to notice more and more things and it has finally sunk in; the movie is a reduced shell, the monster that needed to escape after the great success of Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2.Spider-Man is at the prime of his Spidey life; the city adores him and even has an Appreciation Day for him. But of course, happiness never lasts long in the life of young Peter Parker. His friend Harry attacks him, the case of the murder of Uncle Ben opens up once again, and MJ is having problems communicating with him. And once all these things begin taking their toll on him, a symbiote finishes it off by taking over him and he loses it.The symbiote, sadly, is like watching a really bad parody of Jim Carrey in The Mask. He parades around the town trying to win over the ladies (which he never succeeds), and even begins dancing. I've seen the movie two times, and I cringed and turned away both times I saw that. It was devastatingly painful to see what Sam Raimi had done to Spider-Man. Thankfully, this didn't last too long, and right after, he removes the symbiote in probably the best Spidey scene yet.Speaking of best scenes, Spider-Man 3 contains many. As the symbiote takes over him physically, you find yourself so absorbed that you feel like the symbiote is taking you over itself. It also has my favorite fight scene which is the second one between Harry and Peter. It is a very brutal and dark fight, perfectly exemplifying how the symbiote really should've been. But that retarded montage sequence follows right after it.I also liked Kirsten Dunst's performance in the movie. In the past two films she had an occasional semi-corny moment, but that's gone. She has matured as an actress and does good in her role (too bad it was poorly written).James Franco also did a nice job- when he was a baddie. When he loses his memory you do feel for him but yea, he's corny. As a baddie, the guy is a genius. Too bad it was only during the beginning and middle/end of the movie in which he was GG2.Speaking of villains, I have to say that 2/3 villains worked. Tose villains were Sandman and GG2. Sandman was nearly as good as Doc Ock in Spidey 2, but he was really only there because Maguire and Raimi liked him. They had to include him being the killer of Uncle Ben just to try to give him some purpose in the film. Thomas Haden Church did a magnificent job in the role and his villain was a marvel to watch on the silver screen, but he was probably the least important villain in the film and should've been taken out. Like I already said, GG2 I thoroughly enjoyed.But Venom. Tsk tsk, Raimi, tsk tsk. One reviewer said Venom was really just bait to draw in viewers and they could make more than they spent ($250 mil is a lot for a movie). The reviewer was probably right; I liked Eddie Brock and Venom was more powerful than Spidey but his one weakness kills him and his fight is poorly done. As a matter of fact, most of the battle between Spidey and Venom was Spider-Man falling down and Eddie Brock talking to Peter. Eddie Brock had enough screen time to be developed as a character, but was misused, making him the least effective of the villains.Other small roles include Gwen Stacy and a quick scene with Willem Dafoe. Willem Dafoe is brilliant but the brilliance is shortlived since his scene ends as soon as it started. And Gwen Stacy probably had 2 or 3 scenes total, which was certainly not enough time to give her even 2-dimensional character development.Action sequences and CGI were good as usual. Aside from Harry vs. Peter the second time, none of the action sequences lived up to the ones in the first two. I did like Venom's with MJ on the web but his fight afterwards was pathetic. And Sandman degraded the fight.The love story was very tight, and was so sad. This probably worked best. But because the film had the longest running time they had to cut it off and end the movie leaving their relationship questionable. The movie ended with one of these scenes and I was very disappointed; the movie ended too soon.This is a sad movie in the Spidey saga (since they now have confirmed three more Spider-Man films). While the movie certainly had its highlights, each one had at least one flaw and whatever wasn't a highlight was severely flawed, degrading the presentation of the film. The trailers were deceiving and the hype they built up around the movie was full of lies. We can only pray that Spider-Man 4 will be better and that Sam Raimi will have learned to follow in the footsteps of Spider-Man 2 rather than take the script into his own hands. 6.7/10.By the way, Bruce Campbell's cameo is great!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Critics say the story wasn't at the expectancy level, that the story would evolve more steadily, with perfect pacing, focus at the same time true to the spiderman escence.People complain about too many villains and different focuses on meaningless characters(gwen). But as a fan first rather than a critic, i still enjoyed it. It was fun and entertaining. Common its spiderman, though a carefully, thought out story would have given this one even more praise, at the end of the day its pure entertainment, for every fan to enjoy.

But Has Its Qualities","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1873496/?ref_=tt_urv","Zombie-Kermit","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur12139954/?ref_=tt_urv","13 May 2008","Ever since the release of Spider-Man 3, I have basically seen nothing but hate and anger over the movie. But this is not a review about how other people felt about it. It's a review about how I felt about it. Spider-Man 3 was one of the most hyped movies of all time. Everyone was so excited about the inclusion of Venom as a villain. And huge hype can often lead to a huge disappointment. But I wasn't really as disappointed as most people were. Sure I felt a little unfulfilled by the end, and it was not really what I hoped for at all, but there was still good qualities to it.There were still some good fight scenes, which is always good. The Sandman/Dark Spidey fight in the train tunnels was truly awesome, and was one of the high points of the film. The New Goglin fights were good, and the final battle was pretty cool in my opinion as well. Not to mention the always great Bruce Campbell and Stan Lee cameos. JK Simmons was awesome as Jonah Jameson... of course. And of course the special effects are incredible. The best parts of the movie are clearly what came from the original script.Some of the main problems were the way it was paced, and the way the symbiote was handled. I really didn't want to see Peter spend an hour being a tool. Also, Venom seemed very underused in the movie. I also felt that the characters did not receive enough growth, which was a huge issue for me. MJ's character came across as a little too annoying and Peter didn't seem to behave much like he usually does. And yes, although I like Topher Grace, he was very miscast in this film.I get really sick of every discussion about this movie, or about the Spider-Man franchise as a whole, always comes back to the scene with Peter dancing. So he danced for 30 seconds, it's been a year, it's time to move on people, it's not worth trashing an entire franchise over, it's doesn't mean you can make dumb personal attacks on Sam Raimi, and it's certainly not worth acting as if forty years of comics was just about a little emo kid. Because that is what I'm seeing. And it has grown old. I am glad that I got to share that.I don't understand why people say the Spider-Man series is dead. And I don't get all the hate for Sam Raimi. He made two great Spidey movies and on adequate one. I hope that he will direct the 4th with Tobey still playing Spider-Man. There is still a lot of potential for the series, and I can't wait to see the next movie.All in all, I wouldn't say this was the disaster people are making it out to be, but it still could have been better. I think too many people have bought into the hate and it really stops you from being able to enjoy a movie. People may call me stupid for liking it, but why should I have to apologise for being able to enjoy movies other people can't? It's an awesome trait to have. People with it enjoy themselves a lot more. I like the movie and I've watched it a few times.7/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

How did the franchise fall so far?!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1949591/?ref_=tt_urv","brando647","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3947986/?ref_=tt_urv","21 September 2008","The first Spider-Man film was great fun and ground-breaking in the world of superhero films for Marvel. The second film is still one of my favorite comic book adaptations. So, how do we go from two awesome films to this?! I was beyond disappointed by the third film in the Spider-Man franchise, and I realize I'm not the only one. In this installment, life is finally going well for Peter Parker...Spider-Man is a celebrity in New York City, he's doing well in school, and he's ready to propose to Mary Jane Watson. Everything begins to fall apart when Harry (who is now aware of Peter's alter ego) becomes the ""New Goblin"" to destroy Spider-Man, Mary Jane's career begins a downward spiral, and the police admit to Peter that the man who really killed his uncle has escaped from prison. And all of this is just the tip of the iceberg. I realize that sounds like a lot to fit into a single film, and it IS.One of the most admirable aspects of Raimi's Spider-Man films is his ability to balance story with action. A lot of superhero films tend to lean towards one over the other but Raimi had managed to find the perfect balance between the two. Somewhere between the second and third film, he lost the ability. The movie feels as if it's all exposition, with a few action sequences thrown in. Granted, the action sequences in the film are amazing, just as they'd been in the first two. It just feels as if it's forever between them. As for the exposition, it wouldn't be so bad if Raimi wasn't trying to fit so much story into a single film; I personally feel this movie would've been better if split into two parts. There are at least two love triangles, three villains, the black suit/symbiote, the introduction of a handful of new characters...the list goes on. As a result, each of these aspects feels under-developed and some even feel wasted (Poor Venom...). Bouncing around between so many subplots gives the movie a disjointed feeling throughout.In addition to the story problems, we get a movie filled with some ""what in the world were they thinking?"" moments. I'm sure you've heard about these moments in countless other discussions of the movie: the symbiote giving Peter Parker an emo/goth-style, the Peter Parker jazz club dance scene (second only to Reed Richards' dance number in the Fantastic 4 sequel when it comes to embarrassing moments in Marvel films), the decision to create the New Goblin's style along the lines of an extreme ninja snowboarder, the decision to use the Venom character (one of THE most popular comic characters/villains) for a mere 40 minutes of the movie, and the Sandman/Spider-Man therapy session. With all of these problems combined, it's easy to see why so many people were disillusioned with the latest film. Has Sam Raimi lost touch with the franchise? I seriously hope not.All of the key players return for the newest film, though I find myself losing faith in them. Tobey Maguire gives his usual great performance in the title role. Kirsten Dunst did the best she could with terrible writing; honestly, Mary Jane had become seriously unlikable in this film due to what I perceived as incredible jealousy against Parker/Spider-Man's newfound fame. James Franco has done well as Harry Osborn in the previous films but this time, I've come to a realization. The man cannot play a villain. He's far from threatening and comes off as a fool in some scenes. His attempts to be sadistic or evil as the New Goblin fall flat (with the exception of the fight scenes). Of all the returning performances in the movie, I think the only ones that didn't degenerate were those of Maguire, Rosemary Harris, and J.K. Simmons (who's a riot, as always). The film introduces a handful of new characters to the franchise as well, and most turned out well with what little screen time was given. Thomas Haden Church and Topher Grace were great additions to the cast and I hope to see more of them in the future (well, at least of Church...). Bryce Dallas Howard debuts the character of Gwen Stacy; she did great, but I felt it was sort of late to be bringing in her character from the comics.To make it simple: the third Spider-Man film has it's entertaining moments, but they're scattered through the nearly 2.5 hour runtime. The CGI has continued to evolve and the fight scenes are only getting better. I'm just hoping that this cluttered mess of a film was just a result of Raimi's uncertainty over whether the franchise will continue urging him to fit in as much as possible before it possibly ends. Maybe this was just a fluke and future installments will return to the glory of the first two films.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With the multiple villains and over-worked dramatic scenes between MJ(Kirsten Dunst) and Spidey(Tobey McGuire) continuing with the alter ego that was just ridiculous, the movie was just too busy. It was clear the director, writer, and characters just didn't know how to run this third installment. If you must see it, rent it. The Tobey McGuire crying scenes are enough to make me want to fast forward SEVERAL TIMES in this movie. On the positive, the action scenes were excellent as always...","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It is undeniable quality in some aspects of long, but the expectations generated were so great in so many ways that failures were even more evident and exposed to criticism, making this third installment of the franchise you love weakest of all. With an investment in the tune of $ 280 million outside ad spending, the intention of Raimi as managed to do in the first two thanks to full creative freedom was granted, was present only a villain, at most two, to get back the characters develop well psychologically and not run with the story, keeping the balance between effects and script again. According to the news circulated on the internet, the principle would be the second villain the Vulture, but the producer Avi Arad eventually convinced the director to include another villain to the plot: Venom.For this sequence we also highlight the loss of Danny Elfman, who immortalized the theme songs for the first two long and that helped create the identity and appropriate tone of the film. Elfman did not return due to creative differences with Raimi. In its place was hired Christopher Young, composer versatile but mainly responsible for the soundtrack of thrillers and horror in general as The Grudge, The Glass House, The Uninvited and The Exorcism of Emily Rose. Luckily we knew we would not need to worry about it, because even with the loss of Elfman for this movie, Young has proven a great composer and his work here differs somewhat from themes by Danny Elfman, although he frequently uses the theme main, as it should be in specific scenes. Since Young made many thrillers and horror, and this film has a more heavy and dark, the combination of the track with what was shown married perfectly, being one of the strengths of the work without objection.Finally the script disguises the lack of creativity with the use of the trick of presenting new facts concerning the important facts of the past of the protagonist, and in this case were unreasonable and for the sole purpose of increasing ties between villain and a hero of incredible coincidences aforesaid. Another important point is the inclusion of excess humor, which had variations with great sequences as the frustrated attempt to propose marriage at a restaurant just finishing touches with more melancholic, and horrific sequences as Peter dances in the streets of New York. Among the many high points of the film are criticized: In the comics, the end of the saga known as Secret Wars, Spider-Man has brought the planet where the event occurred, a uniform that was able to read the thoughts of the hero turn into any kind clothes, generate their own webs, among other things. It was the controversial black uniform. In the movie, the symbiotic just reaches Earth without explanation, within a meteorite, and that among every place on the planet Earth, and conveniently falls exactly where are Peter and Mary Jane, and to top it sticks to the bike and Peter accompanies.If Peter was angry, wearing the black uniform, if not, he took the uniform black. Moreover, the powers of the symbiote that appear in comics are not obvious, except that his powers are more leveraged causing a feeling good and invigorating to Peter, which is also more aggressive in some more isolated parts of the film. And worst of all, instead all this aggression, the more Machiavellian see one side and aggressive, we see Peter actually an ""emo"" with the fringe move forward, having a behavior more confident, dancing and playing piano. Then we still have the displeasure of seeing him at the nightclub where Mary Jane serves the tables and sing to customers. After Mary Jane have broken their relationship following the plan Harry, the boy tries to cause jealousy in the girl being accompanied by her new suitor, Gwen Stacy, the boy starts dancing. And to close with a flourish, he still provokes a fight and ends up attacking free his beloved Mary Jane who no longer recognizes him more for his actions. All this to show that his personality was altered by clothing, making him acting like a callous.Venom is another victim of coincidences ""brilliant"" script. Its origin is different journals. Originally being official Globe Gazette, a newspaper rival the Daily Bugle and not the same as shown in the film, that's not the main point about it. In the comics, Eddie Brock Jr (yes, in the movie he has a ""Jr"" in the name for no reason), is fired from the Daily Globe in a story because Emil Gregg accused of being the Sin Eater, a serial killer who had murdered Captain Jean DeWolff, a friend of the Spider. The report would have been a success if a few days after the spider had not caught the real killer. When the self-pity and hatred for Spider exceeded his limits, he decided he should end his life. In the film, the reason comics could be perfectly used in full and would be more believable.The Sandman has always been from the beginning the character's favorite Sam Raimi, and receives special care director, which actually makes it more interesting villain of all present. However, in most of the coincidences script, the solution to make it more humane and tried to justify the character's final scenes in the film, eventually making it the killer of Uncle Ben. It is used as a turnaround used by Tim Burton in his Batman (1989) in which the Joker killed Bruce Wayne's parents. This dramatic shift in the history of Spider opens a lot of possibilities. For example, if Peter would prevent the escape of Dennis Carradine (occurred in the first film), the boy still could not prevent the death of his Uncle Ben Parker, as his killer was Flint Marko, entailing changes in the character of friend neighborhood.Another fact is when Flint Marko is being chased by the police and invades a testing area for particle physics and falls exactly where the experiment will be conducted. The most curious thing is that the transformation could show without much explanation, but trying to give an explanation to the public for a ""foreign body"" was noticed at the test site, an area totally controlled and seemingly impenetrable, the writers show scientists performing experience and notice a change in mass of the test site and think it is a bird. The weight difference between a bird and a person is huge and the weight of Marko would not be so little to be ignored by scientists, who seemed a bunch of inexperienced trainees to reach such a conclusion.The New Green Goblin, now taken over by Harry, as in the comics, had a share expected by now so that the previous movie was over. Raimi had to turn Harry into a new Sprite, and actually quit their participation. In his best performance in the series, James Franco seems more interesting psychologically, going deeper into their motivations still fueled by revenge for Spider-Man. We note that the experimental serum left Harry with the same powers of his father, but without the insanity of Norman. The downside is the clothing of the new Green Goblin, which leaves much to be desired compared to the comics and shows that Harry just gave a perfected in instruments that his father had left him.Peter and Mary Jane have relationship problems and another side of their relationship, as had hitherto romantic and idealized, becomes more real and conflicted when Mary Jane faces problems with his career while Peter is increasingly beloved city. He ends up going blind and not notice that his girlfriend is experiencing problems. And Gwen Stacy just jealous also helps that arise in Mary Jane, even after the kiss that Peter gave to Gwen during the delivery of the keys of the city to him and they reproduce the kiss that immortalized the boy's relationship with Mary Jane. And not least being that MJ jealous of colleague Peter in college, because Gwen is a real temptation disguised as women. Bryce Dallas Howard does very well and Kirsten Dunst dazzles at various times, such naturalness of Bryce on the scene and its stunning beauty. She is the face of the drawings of comic book character and charm is also vented. Unfortunately it is also not as exploited, and only have the function of being in danger in a sequence spetacular crane that struck the building in which she modeled, and adventure jealousy MJ Peter, either in the restaurant, is the club where Peter ""Dark"" dancing on the tables, or the ceremony of the keys to the city.Scenes such as the transformation of Sandman which uses a technology that could control every grain of sand separately and allowed fantastic scenes as the first fight with Spider-Man in the Sand truck and the final scenes of the confrontation. By far, the visual effects are the best of the trilogy, with movements Arachnid much more smooth and uniform, like Venom, beyond its visual. All aerial scenes are indeed exciting. The darker scenes used by cinematographer Bill Pope and art directors J. Michael Riva and Neil Spisak clearly show this darker side caused by the arrival of the Venom symbiote and consequently.Unlike the other films, brighter and more colorful, with scenes taking place day and night, the look more night here and heavier tone and portray the conflicts that part of the trilogy. Raimi could make a big blockbuster in great action sequences at the level of the great Marvel hero, but lost in the story, which despite not being even a little complicated, has many elements and incredible 2h20min seemed little to so many elements and parallel events. The film has a different tone from the others and does not seem to be part of the same universe of the above. also features no scenes flagship anthology and that are stored in memory for a long time. Good fun, though inferior to the others.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

When he turns goth (BTW, what has that to do with the symbiote?) he's even dumber, dancing in the streets with all the girls either walking away or ignoring him. WTF~? MJ, too, isn't herself, acting depressed all along, and even managing to depress Spidey himself. And the audience, of course. It felt definitely better when she was slapped to the ground. On to the enemies now -- the first one, from being a small-time nobody in the comics, is now at the center of the story...not to mention Raimi even altered the events of the first Spiderman. The second one, however, from being one of Spidey's fiercest foes, is now a wuss who only appears for 10 minutes...not to mention he is quite different from his comics counterpart: - no muscles - much shorter - no ""we"" speech - pika-cries a la pokémonAlso, there are some very stupid scenes, like Harry's butler (seriously, what were they smoking?) and the appearance of Gwen Stacy. Who is even depicted as a brain-free chick.To be honest, the movie isn't that bad (hence the ""decent""), since it features exciting (yet absurd) fights and managed not to bore me despite its length. If you're a fan of Spidey, however, be warned: you'll curse A LOT.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Plot In A Paragraph: A black entity from another world bonds with Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) and he starts to bring out the darker side to Parker's personality, which coincided with him having to battle his former best friend Harry Osborne (Janes Franco) who has transformed in to The New Green Goblin, a new villain with a link to Parker's past in Sandman and a rival photographer (Topher Grace) at The Daily Bugle.The saying ""too many cooks spoil the broth"" comes to mind, as too many villains spoil the movie. The early battle over the City of New York between Peter Parker and Harry Osborne was fun and entertaining But the CGI was suspect at times.Maguire, seems so settled in his role, he seems to have stopped trying to act, and the darker Parker was awful to watch. Kristen Dunst returns as the damsel in distress again, but this time her character is unbelievably annoying. Franco steals every scene he is in with either of them. His tortured character is much more interesting, as his is performance. JK Simmons is as reliable as always, as is Rosemary Harris. The action scenes are well shot, but two love triangles slows things down to a snail's pace in between the action set pieces","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was like that old trope in action films, where a gang of fighters surround the hero, but then just take turns attacking. How unrealistic!So Spider-Man 3 was honestly a breath of fresh air for me. And I was surprised that more people weren't saying, ""Finally! The movie I've been waiting for,"" along with me.To me it was the perfect blend of action and heart, of seriousness and silliness, of high and low stakes. I loved it.I know I'm in the minority. But before I heard anyone else's opinion on it, this was already my favorite of the trilogy. If you were actively looking for a more-realistic onslaught of villains, rather than the ""neat and tidy"" approach more typically shown in comic-book movies, this movie is the one for you.

Most of the hate is because it has quite a lot of characters to keep track of and that leads up to a convoluted story but I don't agree with any of these claims (though I do think they should have saved Eddie brock being venom for another movie) I found all the new and returning characters all extremely entertaining to watch. I also found the symbiote, black suit storyline to be the most fun (I'd argue they did the black suit better in this movie than the spider-man 2 game that released in October) I'd also say that Sam Raimi's direction in this movie is better than the first two. The action sequences are all extremely exciting and thrilling to watch. Also the humour is pretty funny and it doesn't ruin the more emotional scenes which I am glad because many superhero movies (marvel) usually ruin fantastic scenes with comedy and I'm glad this movie didn't do that. Something I didn't like about this movie was the inclusion of Gwen Stacy. I didn't like her much because she was barely in the movie the only scenes I remember she was in was a scene in school, the date, the kissing spider-man scene and the crane scene other than that I don't remember her doing much after those. I also didn't really like venom in this movie (like everyone else) because I felt that he was too skinny to be venom. Venom is a huge 10 foot tall, man eating, monster not some small, scrawny, shorter than spider-man punk. Other than that I thought sandman's character was done brilliantly, especially the scene where he can't pick up his daughters locket because he is made of sand. That scene was beautiful. I also thought they handled Harry's death scene really well too. Overall, spider-man 3 is a great movie and a great end to the Sam Raimi spider-man films but it does have a few problems, mostly with the characters. But other than that a great ending to a great trilogy.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I'm in charge round here), chances are you've been convinced that it's the dark chapter in the saga. You know, the grim and brooding one with the web-slinger sat on Gargoyles at the top of Cathedrals in the rain. The one which will send the kids home with nightmares, terrified that Venom is hiding in the attic and so forth. Well, Sam Raimi and co lied to you I'm afraid. That's right, they lied! Because this movie is so light and breezy as to make Scooby-Doo look like The Exorcist and the emphasis is on extended action sequences rather than subtle and layered character development.As such, Peter Parker's much talked about descent amounts to him getting a bit more arrogant than usual, dressing in black, adding a touch of mascara to his face and doing up his hair in a trendy new Indie rock do. If only he'd started listening to The Jesus And Mary Chain in his spare time then maybe Aunt May would have found something more to worry about.Luckily, when Raimi and co are dishing out the action sequences things step up a gear into pure popcorn munching fun. In many ways, it all plays like a video game: Level One, high speed chase with the new Goblin; Level Two, security van smackdown with the Sandman; Level Three, guide Spidey through angst-ridden interpretive dance in a jazz club...It's all very silly and won't be winning anything at Cannes by any stretch of the imagination, but then you don't exactly go to watch comic book movies for bold, innovative film making do you? With Tobey Maguire going through a difficult phase, it falls to the rest of the cast to spice things up, with this year's ""Sympathetic Villain In A Spiderman Movie"" award going to Thomas Haden Church's Flint Marco, aka The Sandman. Raimi clearly has a lot of love for the character as reports of the special effects team studying sand for two years will testify and this is channelled into a moving portrayal of wounded masculinity by the best actor in the film. Given that he's labelled as the real killer of Parker's Uncle Ben, the fact that he's able to wring such pathos from those sad, sad eyes is all the more impressive.If you've seen either of the preceding chapters you'll know what to expect from cast regulars Kirsten Dunst and James Franco, as well as the traditional scene stealing from J. K. Simmons as Parker's boss, so with fanboy speculation driven to breaking point by months of teaser trailers, the bulk of expectation falls on Topher Grace as Eddie Brock, more commonly known as Venom. And aside from the fact that he's not quite imposing enough, Grace does a terrific job. From his first moments on screen, he is delightfully sleazy and just the sort of man who society doesn't want to get hold of super powers. After all, for Parker, great power brings great responsibility whereas for Brock it brings great opportunities for ass-kicking.Sadly though, despite that long waiting period and plenty of build up, Venom doesn't exactly get a lot of screen time. In fact he's barely shown up before the climactic brawl for all that pitches our hero into a match with all three of his foes at once. It's terrific to see Venom on screen naturally but you can't help wishing he were there longer and it winds up feeling an awful lot like a Wrestling Pay Per View which features the long awaited return of the Rock, only for him to fall off the entrance ramp and get rushed to hospital after four hours of matches between less-interesting grapplers.Parents needn't be afraid though, the nippers are going to absolutely love this. It's not half as bleak as you might imagine, has wall to wall action and best of all, will keep them entertained for a full two and a half hours. For those of us who are a bit older than the kids and a bit younger than their parents however, it does disappoint somewhat after the near-perfect Spiderman 2, even if it does boast a trio of cameos which are all memorable for different reasons, namely Bruce Campbell (awesome!), Willem Dafoe (sinister) and Stan Lee (really, really stupid). On the slim chance that any of the producers are reading this however, I'd recommend editing out the 'swing in front of the American flag' bit for the overseas market when the DVD comes out.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But I am. And I don't care what other people think. I can love the movie if I want to.What I Like:Spider-Man 3 is probably the weakest the trilogy, I agree with that. The writing's not as good, the film is a little clunky, and it suffers from more issues than that. I will go more in depth into that later. But I'm here to talk about what I like.I love the character's in this film. There is a logical progression with them. Peter, after years of saving the city, he finally gets the recognition he deserves, and the people love him. And because of that the praise gets to his head, and he develops an ego. Mary Jane gets big an theater, but when she suffers rejection, it conflicts with Peter's success. Harry is finally ready to fight Spider-Man, after two films developing his thirst for revenge him.And while the film is very cluttered with villains, I think all of them are interesting in their own way.Harry, was easily the best out of all of them, as he had truly transformed into his father, a man he wasn't. Consumed with vengeance, he is however, eventually able to redeem himself. Sandman was also a descent villain, the scene of his birth was beautiful. With effects that somewhat hold up. And told entirely through visuals, it could work as it's own short film. And while cliche, his motivation does work. And he does have a tie to the narrative and the main character.And Venom, who's easily the most out of place character in this film. As he doesn't fit the theme of forgiveness. In the film, Peter had to forgive Sandman for killing his Uncle Ben. Harry has to forgive Peter for apparently killing his father. Mary Jane has to forgive Peter for not being the best boyfriend. However, Eddie Brock doesn't have to forgive anybody.However, Venom is still an interesting character. As Eddie Brock is a corrupt reporter, who after being fired for forgery, grows a hatred for Spider-Man. Even though people say Topher Grace was a miscasting, he did still put up a good performance. Well adapting the comic book character.The action scenes are arguably better the first movie. My favorite one being the fight between Peter and Harry early in the film. It's fun to watch, and while the effects don't hold up, the scene is still a rush.The visual style also has that Raimi charm to it. Looking like a comic book world.And here's an unpopular opinion, I like emo Peter. I think the comedy on this part was entirely intentional, and while I preferred a more serious take on the symbiote aspect of the story, I think the scenes of emo Peter are hilarious. I honestly think the campiness was intentional in these movies. And I think rather than laugh at the movie, and to steal a quote ""You are laughing with the movie.""What I Don't Like:Well, I did say I would talk about what I don't like: so I will do that. Where do I start? Well, Venom feels very out of place, he doesn't fit with the theme. The amnesia plot with Harry is really stupid. And is probably the worse part of it's clunky writing. When Harry should've been the main villain. And the movie doesn't feel like it has a main villain. And the issues of course don't end there, but I'm just beating a dead horse.Conclusion:Now, many might ask, do I like the Amazing Spider-Man 2? And to answer, I don't. Why? Because Spider-Man 3 knows it's stupid. This movie thinks it's super serious. And a great superhero drama. When that's not the case, and you are laughing at it's unintentional hilarity. So I can hate that movie and love this one. And no one will convince me otherwise.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I thought the story was rushed, it didn't make sense, and it didn't flow. Despite these initial impressions, I went to see Spider-Man 3 again last night with a family member. You wouldn't believe how incredibly different the experience was this time.Don't ask me how, but I know that I loved Spider-Man 3 the second time around. Weird, right? I know, but that's how it is! I found myself laughing at the humor more and finding the action much more exciting. The overall story seemed to flow much better, and, most surprisingly of all, it didn't feel so crammed as before. Even Venom didn't seem as pointless a villain this second time around. I did not find myself wanting to rush through the middle of the movie to get to the final battle and I was more appreciative of the character development, which itself seemed to be more integrated into the story. I guess what I'm trying to say is this: Seeing Spider-Man 3 a second time was like watching a whole new movie, and a much more enjoyable one at that.If you didn't like the movie the first time, go see it again. I think you'll find it more likable than you did before.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Talking of songs, the soundtrack is eclectic ranging from Irving Berlin, who died in 1989 aged 101, to modern stuff.Side-plots including regrets and tears aside, this is a film which scores for special effects, but one is entitled to ask if it was such a bright idea to include the crane scene and the destruction of the skyscraper only six years after nine eleven.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Harry (James Franco) and Peter have become alienated, and are hardly on speaking terms anymore, after the unfortunate demise of Harry's father (Green Goblin) more or less by the hands of Spider-Man. Introduce two new villains, Sandman, a ""bad guy"" that probably is ""good"" but just very unlucky, and a parasitical thing from outer space that multiplies any bad sides in its potential hosts by a hundred, and you've got yourself Spider-Man 3! The special effects are, as always in this series, simply amazing, and they have truly taken it up a notch in this one. The story is also quite entertaining and well written, but there are sadly so many negative sides to this film that it really suffers from it. First of all, all the ""Go America!"" stuff in this film is just so overwhelming that I'm willing to bet one of my eyes that 99 % of all non-Americans (and hopefully a high percentage of Americans as well!) just feel embarrassed and sick to the bone from all this silliness. Another thing is that they overdo the whole ""Ooo look at us, we're from New York, we're so multiracial and everything is so fine here."" I recognize that they take their money from certain sources to make these films, but come on, tone it down a little at least. Also, the number of cheap jokes and cheesiness is just too much, it feels artificial and at a certain bar-scene (you'll know it when you see it), I was about a second away from turning the whole thing off. Granted, I'm probably a bit older and perhaps a bit more cultivated, intelligent or whatever than the target audience, but I do enjoy a lot of the Marvel universe, so I guess that entitles me to an opinion. The film is simply too long for it's own good, not that I feel its ""boring"", but in all honesty there's a limit to how many times seeing Parker swing himself across a street can hold anyone's attention. They should perhaps have had one less bad guy, 3 in one movie with separate fates is a bit much, and if it was up to me, they would have had a lot more of Venom in it than the last ten minutes or so. Quite a letdown. All in all, I recommend this film for those that have enjoyed the previous ones, and it is great entertainment for the effects alone, but it seems to me that either the customers have become dumber or they have lowered the age of the ideal customer. 3,5 stars.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I thought Harry's anger towards Spider-Man was so strong that the Hob Goblin could have had a whole movie to himself. The other bad guys were not really needed. But, the Hob Goblin was not the main villain. Sandman was the main bad guy. The effects were quite good for him and I thought he looked great, but I feel he should have been more evil. The writers made him more of a victim than a bad guy.The other bad guy that made an appearance was Venom. Venom was my favourite character through the movie, I was just very disappointed that he had such little screen time. Especially as you have the posters with him all over. The scenes he was in were great though.There were a few things about this film I didn't like. It felt like this film was ripping off parts of other movies. At one point it reminded me of Superman 3. Spider-Man started changing into an evil version of himself. During this time, Peter walks around town dancing and thinking he is gods gift to women. This just didn't seem to fit into the movie at all. It took the atmosphere away from the story and added too much comedy to the film. It distracted us from the main story and point of the film. I know Peter was going through some changes, but it should have been done differently. Secondly, there is a scene where Peter is dancing with some girl to make MJ jealous. This is another scene which should have been left. Out. It looked like a scene from The Mask. It just didn't fit in this film.The effects and action sequences were very good. I really enjoyed them and thought they were as good as the other movies.The acting was as good too. The original cast returned. Toby Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. All did so good job. Other cast members were Thomas Haden Church & Topher Grace. It was also good to see Bruce Campbell and Stan Lee back.OK, look... This is a good film, and I did like it... But the are a lot of things that were not so good. This is 2 films squeezed into 1 and it all feels a bit rushed.I will give this 6 out of 10.""You know... I guess one person really can make a difference.

Although it's full of laughably bad moments, this still is a very watchable movie. CGI seems worse than the 2nd movie somehow, as well as some of the acting. Spider-Man 3 however, is a very entertaining superhero movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I had been waiting 3 long years for this sequel and it was finally here. I saw both Spiderman 1 and 2 opening day, first show of the day, but now I actually got to see it the night before its release.Now what did I think of the movie? I thought it was excellent. Not as family friendly as the last two, which might send some children running, but still an action packed thrill ride that I had come to expect.The script is a bit shaky though, I love Sam Raimi, but you got to give the guy credit, he was under a lot of pressure from fans and producers alike to fit a lot in. I know that Sam didn't want Venom in this movie, not that he dislikes the character, but he didn't feel the time was right. The movie was originally going to be all Sandman, and you can tell. Sandman is really well developed and you really feel for him and his personal problems. Thomas Hayden Church is perfect, and works well with the few lines he actually had.Topher Grace as the snide Eddie Brock Junior is an odd choice, but he plays it well, although not looking the part. His Attitude is almost perfect Eddie Brock, but his appearance makes him seem more like a spoiled kid, and less of a vengeful muscle bound maniac.(IE the way he was in the comics). I am not saying that muscles would have made the difference, but a few days in the gym couldn't have hurt either.As for Venom, he looks really good. Not perfect, as they took some liberties with his appearance, but he still comes off the way he should, a disgusting monster.James Franco churns out an excellent performance (as both goblin and Harry). I dare say he was the best actor in the movie. He was SO good.Tobey McGuire is great once again. I am please to report no really odd facial expressions this time around, which were prevalent in SPM2.He also turns out a great performance as the symbiote wearing Peter. Most critics don't seem to get it, but I, a long time fan, understood what was going on immediately. Although the ""EMO"" look worked somewhat well, I think a stubble beard and spiked hair would have been more appropriate, and more accurate to the comics. I also feel the whole symbiote story was rushed a bit, but what are going to do? Kirsten Dunst puts out her worst performance as Mary Jane, but that by no means makes it bad. I just felt her part was really stagnated in this. I feel she could have been written a little better.Bryce Dallas Howard is gorgeous as Gwen Stacy, a short lived but well acted part in the movie. Really just a cameo for long time fans, same with Captain Stacy.Rosemary Harris is back as Aunt May, although her part is really limited this time around, making her seem more like a wise-woman than Peter's dear aunt.JK Simmons. Oh how I love the, The perfect casting for J. J. since day one. If they start a new trilogy, he should be kept on.Cameos by Both Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson) and Norman Osborn are used well. I am a big fan of Willem Dafoe, so I was happy to seem him once more.Notable Cameos by Bruce Campbell, and The guys who played the Robber in the first movie, and Flash Thompson. Not to mention Stan Lee's most obvious role ever.The special Effects are top notch, with only a flaw or two here and there. Definitely better than Spiderman 2, which I felt had very obvious CGI.The fight scenes are well acted and very crisp. A bit of humor in the final battle scene kind of killed the mood, but if you look past it, it's fine.Some Cheesiness here and there and a bit of a wash over script pull the movie down a bit. 10 more minutes and a modified ending would have made this movie and A.This movie falls somewhere between 1 and 2 for overall quality. I still can't decide where I place it though.If it was split into two movies, I think it would have been better, because there really is two movies worth of info in one, which can become confusing to the casual viewer.This movie's biggest flaw seems to be that it leaves you wanting more, with lots of loose ends not tied up at the end.Overall, I enjoyed it very much, and plan on seeing it again. I hope people will go see it and make their own judgment, and not listen to critics. Well, if you are going to listen to one, listen to Joel Siegel, he gave it the most accurate review.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

"6","/10","One big mess - Overlong and over-plotted.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2135129/?ref_=tt_urv","blacklist-1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20315296/?ref_=tt_urv","2 October 2009","When I saw the first Spiderman back in 2002 I thought it was brilliant and that Sam Raimi had superbly conveyed the superhero successfully to the big screen.Then two years later Spiderman 2 came out and it was even better, with more strands of plot included, but it was tightly packed and the film showed real depth and exploration of the characters emotions with the various stock situations that were taking place.With Spiderman 2 being so flawless I had extremely high expectations for the third and I have to say I was quite disappointed. But first the positives of this film and one thing that cannot be criticised is the special effects of the suits namely Spidey's and the dark suit and when Sandman changes from dust to figure is awesome to look at making the CGI improved from the second.The acting from the big three, Magurie, Dunst and Franco is as good as it ever was with the additional support in particular Thomas Church as Sandman was great and the action sequences were exciting, which made it entertaining but unfortunately that is all I could pull that I liked from this film.Unfortunately the rest of the film and the problem mainly being the plot, it was just too long and too much included.For example we not only get Sandman and Venom but the return of the Green Goblin and Spidey's dark side coming out and to add Peters relationship with Mary Jane is under threat.The movie crumbles under it's own weight with so many plot lines. I found the stories difficult to follow and instead of flowing naturally like the second, which if you remember had one main story and a few sub-plots, it felt clichéd.For example when the Harry bumps his head during his fight with Peter and gets amnesia just felt ridiculous. Not to mention that fight sequence was edited too fast. I felt dizzy when watching it.But the core problem of the plot was it lacked the emotional involvement of the characters as everything happens so quickly because there is so much to include.What's also gone is the humour that helped make the first two more humanistic and made that character development go a bit further.This made me feel as though the film was just going through the motions.Another criticism is parts of the acting, Maguire for example when he came out with his dark side, his attempt at portraying a villain was pathetically foolish and Dunst became irritating with her character MJ moaning all the time.Some of the other scenes like when Harry finds out his father killed himself from his servant Bernard who (if you can remember him) was a very minor character in the first two tells him that, but how would he know? You hardly ever saw him.In the end to put it simply Raimi tried to be too clever by including more than he should have and we have been left with a film that is one big mess.I would suggest he should have just had the Green Goblin and Sandman for this film as the dark suit and Venom link, which could have been left to the next film.It was still entertaining and I recommend you see it, but be prepared to be disappointed as this isn't spectacular. Lets hope this is just a glitch is what has been a superb franchise and that Spiderman 4 will be much improved.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

If you watch a 3 hour movie and at the end still want more, it was phenomenal. Spiderman 3.....15 minutes in I decided it couldn't be over fast enough. Too much going on about this and that and not enough dealing with what was actually going on. It was basically watching 135 minutes worth of character and plot development then 5 minutes of ""oh yea, here's some of the actual movie."" Almost everyone in the theater was talking amongst themselves and ignoring the movie. Movies should make you forget about real life. They should sweep you into the world of the movie, make you feel that you are a part of what is happening, like you have a say in what goes on.

Spidey's love life, involving a plan to propose to Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), is complicated by the arrival of a new gal pal, Gwen Stacy (Bryce Howard). Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) is still around, and in the film's most touching moment gives Peter her old engagement ring to give to MJ. Life at the paper goes on as well. As has been the case with the two previous films, the best moments are the quiet, non-costumed ones. The moment the costumes go on, the movie takes a jarring turn into computer-designed cartoons. And while these cartoon sequences are an improvement over those in the first movie, they're still just cartoons. I guess the kids don't care. Now for the real problems: Macguire is a one-note actor, so some of his most dramatic moments, like being spurned by MJ and when one of the main characters dies, are singularly unconvincing. Also, Dunst acts like she wishes she were anywhere but in yet another Spider-Man movie. And three villains, plus a running time of well over two hours, is just too, too much. Nevertheless, the film was put together by a master hand (Sam Raimi) who has guided the series from the beginning. So, unlike many of the sequels to films about Superman, X-Men, Batman and Robocop, which were often directed by others and frequently mishandled by their studios (you should read about the butchering of ROBOCOP 3), this second Spider-Man sequel lets us continue to have an interest in Peter Parker and his constant travails. I have no doubt a fourth film will happen, and frankly I wouldn't mind seeing Topher Grace replace Maguire. Grace out-acts Maguire at every turn here.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Even being an extra 15 minutes or so longer than its predecessor, the film still has to juggle three villains (Sandman, Harry Osborn, Venom) along with subplots about the rocky roads of new love, a ""Superman 3"" style 'dark personality' subplot, the ongoing Harry-Mary Jane-Peter love-hate triangle, not to mention giving time to a half dozen other characters both new and old.Surprisingly the film does manage to wrap things up by the end, so much so that it feels like an 'unofficial end' to the series in some ways with no cliff hanging stories left to resolve. Yet how most of these are resolved is done in some rushed and often unsatisfactory ways and that's where ""Spider-Man 3"" falls apart. The elements are there for some great drama, but they're never developed enough to become involving, and often awkwardly mix rather than cohesively gel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So don't let people who downgrade this movie fool you. This movie delivers exactly what the previous two installments provide: a roller coaster ride filled with action, surprises, and classic Spidey-like personal problems. In fact, although this film obviously takes virtually no plot line from the comics, it captures the madness that Spidey's life often becomes superbly (even better than the first two).Granted, there is an awful lot jammed into this movie. You do start wondering, how can one person's life ever be this screwed up? Ask any teenager or college student struggling to fit into a world that seems to throw them one curve after another. Naturally and fortunately, most teenagers don't have to deal with being pummeled by mega-villains with super strength and nasty weapons.And all performances in this movie are excellent; and in my opinion, Kirsten Dunst can sing!So not only do you get all the ""amazing"" action you have come to expect, but some great plot twists, some good humor relief at the right moments, and a simple but important message: anger and hatred will destroy you and all those that you care about if you can't forgive those who have caused you pain.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

At least it's no Incredible Hulk or Fantastic Four.The Bad: While Spiderman did a better job than I expected of tying together three un-connected villains and the obligatory Mary-Jane subplot, the story still felt rushed and choppy, especially toward the middle. And yet, it still managed to drag in parts. The evil/ possessive technology, while given just enough exposition in earlier movies, was introduced sloppily in this one. The dialogue was almost as bad as the tripe in Star Wars episode III at points, and the visuals were equally corny. If they ever have Spider-man pose in front of a CGI American flag or burst out at the end with some trite moral lesson again, I'm gonna puke. Finally, and this is probably just a personal issue, but Mary-Jane was at her most obnoxious and self-centered. May all Spidey-fans forgive me, but I was cheering for Gwen and Ursula for most of the movie.The Good: Granted, a lot of the special effects were iffy, but they could really be spectacular sometimes. Though I'm sure some found it boring, the scene introducing the Sandman's powers was actually quite beautiful. And while the serious scenes fell flat, those which were meant to be comedic were just perfect, with the exception of...The Ugly: Tobey Maguire does not pull off Angst.

The film has several defects and one of the biggest is in the script that tries to put together three villains for only one film and this ends up making everything very confusing and poorly done. However, some lessons and speeches in the film make it not as bad as some say. A high point of the film is also the CGI which is very beautiful. But of course that doesn't take away the fact that he is very problematic and has several bad things like the emo Peter Parker and the Venom plot. In the end, it's an average movie with a bad script and some weak acting, but it's far from being a horrible movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is certainly the least of the three and that says a lot, because we are crazy about its predecessors. The film fails to figure out what it really is all about, and we get a film packed with so many villains who don't get enough screentime, and maybe some of them shouldn't have had any. This time around, the acting is a little edgy but I guess it's because of the script and its endless revision. It bothers me a little, as this could possibly have been the definitive ""Spider-Man"" if Raimi had only omitted a few items from the movie and even added a few more good lines to the script.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In fact I didn't like Spider-Man 2 back then because I absolutely hated Doc Oc. But this movie, damn, this was the best movie for me!Everything people say about this movie is bad, I like those exact things. Too many plots? Good. Emo Parker? Awesome! The way Sandman was shown? I love it. There's no convincing me otherwise. The only problem I had was that Venom was a mindless beast whereas in reality he does speak normally. It was more of a lack of understanding of a character than studio meddling.You will enjoy this movie more if you binge watch it along with the previous two movies. It seems to absolutely fit in the pieces. The character arc of Peter is also very satisfactory. It may not hold up against the other two movies of the trilogy, but it is an epic journey of Peter Parker going from being a high school nerd to becoming one of the most popular superheroes of all time. And there is no other Spider-Man movie until now that has shown this saga better.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I would've been fine with where it ended other than the Harry Osborn cliffhanger.Regardless, the New Goblin stuff was aggravating. It wasn't bad by any means but I was just so fed up with back and forth Harry stuff by the end of the movie. I also kinda wish the movie didn't end on a sad death since we never got a fourth film.The action in this movie was still good and it was still funny, but there was nothing that stuck out to me as much as the scenes in 2, and half of what was funny I feel was unintentionally so.For returning cast, everyone does good. Jameson still steals the show and Peter and MJ were good, but MJ annoyed me a bit this movie. It was also hard to root for Peter with him never explaining to people why he was acting so awful.The black suit stuff was an interesting concept to see adapted, but I don't know if it was a great writing choice to have your protagonist being an a**hole for half of a film that already has too many villains.It doesn't help that the entire Venom symbiote part of the movie wasn't in Raimi's original vision and it shows. Every other character Raimi treated with so much care, perfect casting, writing, origin, humanization - then there's Venom. We get next to no explanation for the symbiote and it's powers and origin. When Eddie fuses to Venom (who isn't even named) he looks awful and just bloats the last half hour of the film. Venom's inclusion hurts the entire movie, not just his own character.Sandman was well casted and it was a villain I came to care about like Doc Ock, but I feel like he didn't get the screen time he needed because of the other villains. How he got his powers looked cool but made no sense. They don't even explain what the experiment was that caused it, just ""oh he's made of sand now"". The movie would've been miles better if he was the only villain and got a proper origin and conclusion.The Goblin plot should've ended earlier too. Jumping between Peter, MJ, Harry, Sandman, and Eddie/the symbiote made it to where I would literally forget certain characters were in the movie when we got a chance to focus on one of the other's plots.Overall just way too much going on for me to say this movie comes close to the first two. Still, Sandman was a great pick to bring back for No Way Home.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

As a Spider-Man fan I can say the same and say that they did it well. They took Spidey's emotions and flaws to the forefront more so than ever before and managed to pack a WHOLE lot of accurate Spider-Man lore into the film while at the same time not being insulting or stupid with the parts there weren't accurate. They tied everything together very effectively and even though they had to rush the character development they managed to properly and appropriately develop the parts that were important to the story. They established Eddie Brock and the symbiote's reasons to hate Spider-Man and even managed to show all of the emotional vibes the both Harry Osborn and Sandman have gone through over the years and somehow manage to tie it all in to the story. All in the all, they did Spidey justice and gave such a great mix of action, romance, drama and told a story of love, revenge, inner conflict, redemption, forgiveness, friendship, jealousy, I could go on and on. It really had something for everyone and again even if I weren't a Spider-Man fan, I could appreciate it for what it was. Is it perfect? Of course not, but it's a good time that will show you so many different aspects and life and fantasy that it has something for just about any mood you could have and THAT makes for a very good film.","12 out of 25 found this helpful.

The effects were great, but that just kind of wore thin also. Thomas Haden Church as the Sandman, was not badly acted, but badly written. Topher Grace seems to bring some light in this.

Spider-Man was great. Spider-Man 2 was better. Spider-Man 3 was... wait, what the hell was this? Anything but good anyway.The film was packed with so many unnecessary subplots that it was just a mess, some dodgy CGI in places - that chase scene near the start with Peter and Harry in the air? Horrible! Wooden acting, too many villains and cringe-worthy attempts at comedy - J. Jonah Jameson wanting a camera gag? Peter dancing in the streets? I can see why people would enjoy it (senseless, campy fun), but I just felt they made such a mess of it. I think they tried to cram far too much into one movie. It would have been perhaps better if they only introduced the Venom idea at the end of 3, and then developed that into Spider-Man 4 instead of having Venom, Sand Man and Harry in the one film because so much could have been done with the Venom/Symbiote thing that it could have been a whole movie. Unfortunately, in was all crushed into the one.For me, there were only two redeeming qualities: Raimi's masterful direction and Bruce Campbell's genius cameo. Still, these aren't going to help this horrible wreck of a movie. So many missed opportunities. Spidey 4 better be an improvement... but to tell the truth, that won't be hard.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"6","/10","""Spider-Man 3"" is an action-packed treat... If you are in the right mindset...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1749740/?ref_=tt_urv","TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4669024/?ref_=tt_urv","20 October 2007","""Spider-Man 3"" seems to be the most debated film of the summer. On one hand, some love it... on the other, some despise it. I personally loved the movie for what it is... an enjoyable, fast and action-packed thrill-ride, that may not be quite up to par with the previous film (the neo-classic ""Spider-Man 2""), but is still a great movie nonetheless.Like many, the only real complaint I have is that too many characters and stories are crammed into the film. Though, I actually think it all functions well as one complete story.In a nutshell, Peter has finally found some peace and attained the happiness that has been eluding him the past few years. He plans on asking MJ to marry him, the city finally accepts him as a hero, and all seems well and dandy.Unfortunately, things are about to change.First, Harry (still convinced Peter murdered his father), becomes the devious ""New Goblin."" (His storyline in the film is somewhat complicated, so I won't go into it yet.) Then, it is revealed that a new figure (the tragic Flint Marko) was there the night Uncle Ben was shot, and he may be the real killer. However, Marko inadvertently exposes himself to a particle demolecularization experiment, which crystallizes his genetic material and turns him into the dreaded ""Sandman"", a hulking ""villain"" that can fly, transform his body parts into weapons, and in several cases become a giant beast! Finally, a meteorite lands on the Earth, unleashing a gelatinous being (similar in style to ""The Blob"") that eventually latches itself to Peter, transforming his costume and turning him into ""Dark Spider-Man"", which causes Peters emotions (particularly anger) to amplify beyond normal bounds. It basically turns Peter into the ""ADHD-Spider-Man."" On top of all that, MJ can't get that break in show business she desperately wants; a sinister and arrogant new photographer (Eddie rock) is trying to out-do Peter at every turn; and the sexy Gwen Stacy seemingly has eyes for Spidey, causing tension between Peter and MJ.Now, mind you, that is a simplified version of just the first half of the movie! From there on in, the plot-lines develop and intersect at various points, feeding off of one another, until we get to the climax. We even get new sub-plots on top of everything else! ""But if the movie is so overstuffed, how can it possibly be any good?"" So glad you asked! You see, normally if a movie has anywhere near as many intersecting plots and ideas as there were in this film, I seem to tune out, as it gets way to confusing.With ""Spider-Man 3"", somehow Sam Raimi (the director of all three films, and co-writer of this entry) manages to keep all the goings-on grounded to a certain degree, and simplifies them just enough that you don't loose your mind.Would I have preferred a simpler story? Definitely. But did the movie at least do a good job of juggling the 800 (or so) plot lines going on? Again, definitely.Believe me, I could go on for hours on the structure of the film, and how it all works out. But that would just become monstrous and pointless.So, before I wrap up, let me quickly go over a few of the points I have missed...-Venom... Yes, Venom is in this movie, which is an established fact by now. And many complain that his role is too small, but for me, it works better this way. The story lines in ""Spider-Man 3"" all revolve around the human aspect of the characters. With Venom, you don't have any humanity to ""feel"" for. He is basically portrayed as an arrogant man (Brock), who attains the suit and decides to use it for revenge on those he feels have wronged him. The suit is really just used to show how arrogance and power can corrupt. And Eddie is only used as an agitator for Peter. So it makes sense that Venom's usage be limited... Once the ""Dark Spidey"" and Brock story lines are done, there isn't much call for Venom, as he doesn't add anything new... (Other than to help make the final battle really cool!) -Harry... As I mentioned above, Harry's story is interesting and somewhat complex. He starts the movie as a total villain, attempting to kill Peter in an action sequence I can only describe as ""dazzling"" and ""amazing."" However, he ends up receiving a severe head injury which causes him to suffer memory loss. (He has amnesia... get over it!) I thought this was a very appropriate story-telling point. By giving him amnesia, he forgets about all his hatred towards Spider-Man. And we are reminded that beneath all the callous, empty rage, there is a real human... Someone sweet and kind. That way, even when he regains his memory, we still feel sorry for him. Trust me, it works! -Sandman... I feel that Sandman is a wondrous character, that I would rank right behind the perfection that was Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus. We learn early on that he only resorted to crime to get money he desperately needs to help his daughter, who is suffering from an unnamed illness. And the influence his daughter has over him is what propels his hatred towards Spider-Man, who foils his attempts to get the money. Thomas Hayden Church proves perfect, turning in an outstanding performance!-The Effects... The effects in this movie are indescribable. For the first time ever, I often forgot that I was even looking at effects. As far as I was concerned, everything was real!So, wrap up time! ""Spider-Man 3""... a solid 8. Not the greatest movie ever, but a lot of fun, with emotion and ""real characters.""

And there was one big disappointment...Venom, now this is how I remember Venom from the comics and cartoon, Venom was this strong, built, Anger Management kinda guy; like Arnold with black goo on him. Not the small weak guy off the 70's Show...and besides the whole reason I was waiting for the movie to come out was to see Venom...and I only got to see Venom for 15 minutes. What would have been really good was to see Venom and Carnage fight Sider-Man, not the goblin and sandman and then Venom just shows up randomly...but I like the bell tower scene that part they did very well on; just like the cartoon and comic book. But Come on Venom is the best Villain there is, that whole movie should have been about him. But overall it was a good movie and I enjoyed it I even saw it again after opening day.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Well I was right, it didn't work out. Venom was on screen for about 15 minutes and got his behind throttled the whole time. I mean, Venom is supposed to terrorize Spider man, TERRORIZE= ruin his life! One scene does not officially terrorize anyone! This franchise is dead to me, to one day be revived probably 10 years later like the Batman films.To the makers of this film. You had one of the coolest villains of all time at your disposal, and you completely wasted him. You butchered one of the best superheroes ever created. Wait until you see the opening box office of your next Spidey film, if you even have the balls to make one.

I wish they had spent more time with a plot instead of just throwing villains in for the sake of having them. The special effects for Sandman were great but it definitely felt like there was no real reason to have him in the movie other than just getting a cool villain from the comics into the movie. The Venom / Spidey dynamic was good and I wished they had focused on that more, letting Peter delve a little more into his bad side. They could have definitely amped up Eddie Brock's character as well, playing into his rivalry with Peter more. They also focused too much on the relationship between Mary Jane and Peter. Obviously, that is a major part of the story, but it felt more like a romance movie / drama than an action movie at many times. Overall, it was good but not great.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Here's some advice I heard from Elvis Duran from the y100 Morning Zoo(a great radio show, by the way)that really helped me: go see this film with mediocre expectations and you'll get great results.

And I wasn't the only one, since the people in the cinema started applauding at the end of the film (this is the first movie I see at the cinema getting applauses at the end). I've seen a lot of comments saying that there was little character development, poor acting, etc. In my opinion, for a movie that lasts only two hours and a few and can make you sad, make you laugh and give you adrenaline rushes all in one film, it's great.I agree to the fact that the character development was poor, but for a film with three villains and quite a few supporting characters, it handles all their story lines pretty well. After all, Spider-Man is an action packed thrill ride, it's a very fast and dynamic film, if you want strong character development for a comic-book based film go see Batman Begins or wait for The Dark Night. The CGI is stunning; it's worth every cent of the 250 million dollars invested in this movie, especially the scene of Sandman's ""birth"".As for the acting, I say it again, for a super-hero action flick, it's pretty good, JK Simmons and Bruce Campbell are very funny in their scenes, and I even found the scenes with ""possessed emo-style"" Peter to be quite refreshing and funny. Regarding the supporting characters, I think that they weren't given much screen-time on purpose, their appearance here being merely a sort of introduction, and I'm sure they'll get their moments of fame in the upcoming sequels.Overall, I think it was a great movie, one of the best super-hero comic-based films, and definitely over its prequels. And I say it again, it should be regarded as an overall positive and dynamic film, focused on action, but also with elements of drama and comedy - not a dark, psychological thriller, focused on drama and character development.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

One thing that really disappointed was there was not nearly enough venom. They show the guy for like 10 minutes and that was it. In my opinion he is the slickest villain to be shown in spider man movies.They show very little of him.

It is obviously crucial that I start out the review by mentioning that I liked the first two films (both 8/10's). I think Maguire was terrifically cast, the special effects are terrific, and I liked the sweet, loving relationship between Peter and MJ. But the third film in the series is like gasoline poured into your favorite glass of milk. It fails utterly and miserably.I am awarding it a 4 out of 10 for one reason only: the stupendous special effects. Although the effects will no doubt be beaten by the likes of 'The Golden Compass' and 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End', the Sony team does a stellar job of bringing Venom, the Sandman, and Evil Harry to life.Now. Let's talk crap.The dialog and relationship between Peter Parker and MJ is grossly miscalculated. When Peter missed poor dear MJ's play in the second film, I actually felt distressed about it. Now, when MJ is ordered by Evil Harry to break up with Peter, it's a barely painful scene to watch. By now, Peter has become so whiny and predictable, I wish he would just hook up with Ursula and be done with it. Just kidding.But still, it gets annoying after a while. I feel like I would rather have someone like Jake Gyllenhaal playing Spidey now. Maguire is tired out.And there's also one awful, inexplicably and shockingly stupid scene involving Spidey and his nearly erotic connection to his new black suit. It seems as though the suit not only makes his greedy and extremely powerful, but it also serves as a tool for lusting after beautiful women. This leads to the formerly mentioned awful, inexplicably stupid and shocking scene where Peter/Spidey decides to go onto the sidewalk and dance the day away. Literally, dance. And make suggestive gestures as attractive women.I chuckle as I imagine the stupefied expressions on the audiences faces as they watch this unbelievably idiotic scene.But hey, cheer up. There's one scene in the movie that works perfectly. It's after The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church overacting) escapes from prison, and meets up with his angered wife and still-loving daughter. That scene is sweet and realistic, and it works very, very well.But the rest...just doesn't. Resist the temptation of that shiny cover, and instead pick up the DVD copy of 'Waitress', a much more funny, touching, and real movie than this one.1.5/4","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This time, he must duel with the Sandman, Green Goblin and Venom, as the movie, literally, loses the plot. I could try and explain it to you, but it would make The Big Sleep sound like Snakes On A Plane. The basic thread is Spider-Man discovers his dark side, after being infected with a black substance from outer-space. It causes him to stop combing his hair, do a ridiculous ""impression"" of John Travolta from Saturday Night Fever and generally act like a horny sixth-former. It also greatly increases his violent tendencies, as he shows no remorse pummelling some of his enemies to their apparent deaths. In the mean time, Mary Jane is failing as an actress, and getting kidnapped every now and again. Her relationship with Peter is once again strained, which has a lot to do with the introduction of Gwen Stacey, another potential love foil.The first two Spider-Man movies were underwhelming, in terms of spectacle (Spider-Man 2 less so). The CGI had always been ropey, the dialogue reeked of cheese, and much of the action was disappointingly pedestrian. What the series had going for it was its heart and faith in the characters. It was never really about Spider-Man but Peter Parker, who struggled with his identity in the last film, only to come clean to Mary Jane at the end. Spider-Man 3 aspires to the same level of drama, with none of the reward. The plot is completely incomprehensible and having three bad guys wander in and out of the film's narrative only serves to make matters more confusing. Firstly, why do we need the sandman? There is nothing scary about a man who can turn into a beach, whether he is played by Thomas Haden Church or not. Secondly, whenever a character suffers from Amnesia, it is usually a film-making short cut so we can go over ground already trampled upon in the past. And that is exactly what happens here. Thirdly  Venom is played by Topher Grace, the single most annoying actor in the world. If you had ever read the comics or even seen the animated series of Spider-Man, you would know that Venom is meant to be scary as hell. Yet listening to him talk like a racquetball-playing yuppy, albeit occasionally screeching, just made me think what he really needs is a nice cappuccino and a Apple laptop to put his photos on.The film's saving graces are all down to director Sam Raimi and leading player Tobey Maguire. Raimi has always been good at placing comedy in his films, and there are a couple of really funny moments, involving Bruce Campbell in a hilarious cameo, and JK Simmons doing JJ Jameson, the newspaper editor from hell shtick, he does so well. Also, the action isn't half bad either. There is an absolutely spectacular sequence involving a humongous crane pillaging through the side of a skyscraper, only for Spider to come to the rescue. But at a reported $258 million (that's fifty million than Titanic) it does not justify its price or hype. There are only so many times we can witness Mary Jane get kidnapped before it becomes numbing. Tobey Maguire does his best, as always. And does nothing to disserve the drama of the piece.

In some ways, if you've seen one Spider-man movie you've seen them all. The action scenes have a similarity. It mostly has to do with people about to hit the ground, suddenly being swooped up at the last second. As experienced viewers, we know there isn't going to be a splat, especially if the victim is young and pretty. The best of the story rests with the villains and there are some good ones here. The Sand Man is really a fun creation, morphing and blowing around and coming back to his initial form. In this particular setting, there seems to be a lot of danger of innocent bystanders being victimized by forces over which they have no control (bitten by spiders?) In this film, Peter's turning over to the dark side could be understandable. He gets no credit for anything and the world has about a ten second attention span. Heroes become goats in a millisecond. Still this is a rapidly moving, fun film with some issues still up for grabs.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

I want you to kill Peter Parker "" This film is an action packed superhero flick which delivers what any superhero film requires to deliver. Superb sequences of actions with a sprinkle of iconic storyline.The first spiderman was the worst in my opinion. But it did well to introduce the trilogy. The second spiderman was a brilliant installment of the trilogy. But i personally think this spiderman is simply the best of the series so far (hopefully) There was a lot of speculation on whether the film could be able to deliver a good way of shuffling the 3 villains together. However, the story proved this speculation wrong and the story was well crafted. I don't want to go too into the story or the ending, its for you to see.The only bad points of the film is the fact that we didn't get to see more of Venom which was disappointing and there were a lot of far-fetched moments but then again, this is a superhero film! In conclusion, this is definitely the best superhero film ever made, towers over superman. A must see 8/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

As in the best tradition of superhero films, they go slowly downhill from the first film, and then start accelerating towards the depths of Batman & Robin, Rocky 5 and so on. This was a muddled adventure. Half of the movie resembled teenage tantrums with superpowers added in. The other half had a mish-mash of perplexing action scenes. Almost every scene is predictable. Aunt May is not so much a character as a string of clichés. I don't understand what happened to the Sandman - why didn't he sit down and chat to Peter Parker earlier and save the need for the last hour of the film? Does he know that he can fulfil his aim by voting for the Democrats next year for universal health care? Evil/Emo Peter Parker was just bad, not evil. Three villains is a silly idea, and not one of them is memorable or outstanding. Hostage scenes, friend/family-in-hospital scenes, innocent-victim-being-rescued scenes - all been done before and have even been done in the Spiderman series itself!! In the end, I haven't bothered to structure this review and make it sound coherent, much like the scriptwriters for the movie itself.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I just love the problems brought up in the movie that actually appear in real life. Tobey Maguire plays greatly once again and so does Kirsten Dunst. The movie is a continuous surprise. THe fact that Peter Parker has to overcome the dark forces not only the external power surrounding him but the eagerness that brings him closer to that evil. He fights it in the end but it is great seeing how he can also show his darker side..it proves that superheros are people too and that they make mistakes just like every other guy.. Stereotypically Superman or any other hero would pretend not to care about the opinions of other people. He would pretend like he doesn't like the commercialised part of his achievements..but lets not forget that every human would be delighted to know that the public allows them.

After two strong films, the trailer for ""Spider-Man 3"" looked spectacular with the distinct possibility that the interesting character work which had been started in the opening films would be taken to a whole new level. Unfortunately, whilst the third film in the trilogy is entertaining and a great spectacle, it is a disappointment as the film is lost without a proper plot and caught in a mêlée of villains and plot lines.The film starts off well. We begin with Parker, as opposed to Spidey, dealing with his everyday life and then being confronted by the New Goblin, his friend Harry Osborn. There is no problem with this. We have a plot and we know where we're going. We're heading towards a satisfying end to the trilogy's storyline. But then, that plot line is put into limbo for an hour, as is the action and we go off establishing the rest of the villains and their backstories. Every plot line and every villain is introduced and then abandoned for a long period of time. The plot is easy to follow, but it is shallow.However, the beacon of light was the inner struggle that Spidey must face. Alas, the really dark moments have little or no effect on the character and he only realises that he is turning into a thoroughly evil dude when he hits someone in a rash of anger, an event where no-one gets hurt. So, what was going to be the big climax of the central theme of the series (duality and the conflict between good and evil) turns out to be a real disappointment and without any great depth.Having said that, whilst this film lacks the brains that would have made it fantastic and any kind of proper plot it does have spectacle and entertainment in abundance. Whilst the visual effects are a bit lacking at times, all of the set pieces are done well. However, the final climax is almost ruined by the bizarre use of a news broadcast which is condescending and, frankly, unintentionally comical. Which emphasises another failing here. This isn't anywhere near as funny as the previous films or indeed as it should be.But there are the great cameos from J.K. Simmons and Bruce Campbell which bring some humour, but there are also very solid performances. Maguire has a lot of fun here. He becomes Travolta-esquire in a sequence that has Parker strut down the street. Whilst the idea of this is jarring, the performance is a joy to watch. James Franco has improved and Kirsten Dunst is solid.But there is nothing too much to ride home about here. It isn't as clever as it needs to be. It's bloated with too many characters and plots. It may well be satisfying, but it fails to live up to the high hopes. All in all, this can only be described as a disappointing end to what was shaping up to be a really interesting, subversive and magnificent super-hero trilogy. There will be a ""Spider-Man 4"" but, frankly, this series has said all that it has to say. It must stop, now.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's not that you can't have light-hearted comedy mixed with drama but the light and dark were so contrasty it tend to hurt ones eyes.First things first, you have Peter Parker as a main character as well as his alter ego, Spiderman. Right there you have two threads to follow. His personal life and his superhero life. Add two villains each with personal lives and villainous lives. Add Harry Osbourne Jr.(James Franco)who flips back and forth between good and bad, Mary Jane Watson and Gwen Stacy as a convenient love interests.This in itself is a feat to maintain any level of consistency while tying together a meaningful plot. What seemed like a good idea, was to give everyone a real human conflict that was magnified by their alter-ego. That way we could connect to everyone, and no one at the same time.Because let's face it at the end of the day this movie personifies everything bad about the comics 'kids' used to read 30 years ago. Comics have gotten better...I just don't know why nobody is paying attention.There were parts that were soooo whacky that I really believed Jerry Lewis was going to step into the scene screaming, ""LAAAADY!"". Granted those scenes in and of themselves were sometimes very funny (J.J.Jameson especially) but man...not the right movie for it. There was no spine to the story and too many cooks in the kitchen. Simple as that.=s=","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

In fact one can convincingly argue that the Spiderman movies back up into the first three slots,(with the third one being the best), for the Spiderman movies alone amongst superhero series may stroll alongside Lord of the Rings and Star Wars as movie series comprised of individually outstanding films that maintain or improve in quality and depth with each iteration.A few superhero movies combine special effects and a solid plot to provide an enjoyable, escapist experience. It's when superhero movies attempt profundity that many falter. The inherent psychological complexity of the Hulk beckoned its writers to focus on David Banner's inner struggle and the writers failed miserably; the Hulk not only offers no non-obvious insights, but is ridiculous and boring. The X-Men movies focus on social analogy and encounter some success, but only middle-schoolers consider ""accept the other"" themes profound. Only theSpiderman movies have been able to dig into issues of human motivation and social responsibility without slipping into the resultant hole The Matrices are the ultimate example of movies with overly ambitious themes). It's the combination of it's excellent story, fine performances, quality non-overwhelming special effects, and solid exploration of the human condition that earns Spiderman its five stars.Full review: www.nelsonguirado.com/index.php/reviews","14 out of 34 found this helpful.

The film isn't a snoozer: it has joyful moments and jaw-dropping (money, money, money) effects. But it's supposed to be entertaining and inspiring, and it's just too leaden for takeoff. There haven't been many straightforward superhero films. The charcoal-black Spider-Man is quite appealing, as the black-clad Peter does some slick movements in a jazz bar.It's a shame Peter/Spidey doesn't appear very power-hungry, and that he's so easily misled by tiresome old Aunt May. The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) is a fugitive who was pulverized in one of the many particle-physics labs. Spider-Man 3 is a comic-book movie in a distinct genre. It's the sequel to Ben-Hur. My favorite scene in the film is when Peter uses a fork to retrieve an engagement ring out of a Champagne glass. Ivan Raimi and Alvin Sargent's writing wears its heart on its sleeve.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's a shame that people strive to simplify films, to dumb them down to mediocrity. Spider-man 3 contains many threads and the film is well paced as a result. Anyone should be able to follow the story with ease and the pace of the film is sustained and enriched by the intertwined stories. None of the plot threads is particularly challenging but they sustain the story which is, let's face it, all that matters.Okay, the characterisations are not deep, but they are at least three dimensional.One critic I read criticised Tobey Maguire's performance as Peter Parker under the influence of the symbiont. Sure, the performance lacks power, but it moves the story along and when I watch a comic book superhero story I'm not looking for depth, I'm looking for motivation, character and, above all, ACTION! Spider-man 3 delivers action IN SPADES.This is a chewing-gum superhero comic book story and Raimi's interpretation captures this perfectly.If you like fast paced fantasy action superhero web slinging sand blasted sky surfing love stories then Spider-Man 3 will be right up your street.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is indeed I saw many critical reviews pondering and saying that Spidey 1 and 2 were much better. Well, to be completely honest, they are true but not completely.Here is the problem with Spidey 3. First, there is too much drama in the movie. This was probably intended to push the audience to empathize with Peter or Spidey. Unfortunately this simply does not work. I even glanced my watch during the movie to see how long the scene would take. Second reason is probably felt by the Spidey fans. Venom was illustrated too small. Eddie Brock should be much bigger, not a boy-band kind of kid. Thirdly, the ending was a bit shallow. Let's just say, it could have been better.Nevertheless, the movie still serves partly of its main purpose - to relieve all the Spidey fans thirsts after 3 years. The battle scenes were great as the effects were smoother made than the previous two releases. The fact it has different antagonists gave more variety in the battle scenes. Further, the jokes were still great and quite fresh.Simply put, this may not be the best Spiderman movie, but I still love it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The last two editions were too good for me not to expect that. Wouldn't have spent a rare free evening (the movie released on Labour Day here at Singapore) cooped up indoors otherwise. But I really hadn't imagined the movie would be this good.It's very rare that, in a trilogy, movies get better progressively. Spider-man 3 is a great improvement over the last two, and that itself says a lot.The first mid-air fight sequence, a few minutes into the movie, is breathtaking and a sign of things to come. And every few scenes, at an even pace, we get lots of these out-of-the-world sequences. There are three villains - Sandman and Venom make an appearance here - and each one gets ample screen time. Could have done with a little more of Venom. But what the hell, I won't crib.Every actor is in top form. The story, even with the slightly slow-moving emotional scenes, moves at exactly the right pace. The action doesn't get overdone. The drama doesn't make you yawn. It's near-perfect. I simply loved the manner in which Raimi gives depth to each character, even the fantastic villains. The CGI is brilliant, but never overshadows the acting - the true test probably of any movie in this genre. And there's really awesome comedy to complete the package.Go watch this movie the day it releases in your city. Watch out for a short appearance by Stan Lee too.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

Spider-Man 3 may have some redeeming qualities, but it's definitely not as good as the first two movies in the series.On the plus side, Tobey Maguire is still great as Peter Parker\/Spider-Man. And the action scenes are as thrilling as ever. But man, oh man, did they try to cram way too much into this movie.There are not one, not two, but THREE villains (Sandman, Venom, and New Goblin), all vying for screen time. And while it's cool to see these characters come to life, it all feels a bit rushed and mishandled.But probably the biggest issue with Spider-Man 3 is the tone. It's all over the place. One moment we're dealing with some pretty heavy themes (like addiction and revenge), and the next minute we're watching Peter strut down the street like he's in a cheesy dance-off.And let's not forget the emo hair.All that being said, Spider-Man 3 is still watchable. It's not completely terrible, just a bit of a mess. And if nothing else, it's entertaining in an unintentional way.It's not the worst superhero movie out there, but it's definitely not the best. If you're a die-hard Spider-Man fan, you may find some things to enjoy here. But for everyone else, it's probably best to just stick with the first two movies and forget this one ever happened.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Where the first two movies had a nice and clean storyline which was easy to follow, this one was a bit more vague. In this episode several story lines are blended together (the sandman, the venom, son of the Green Goblin), I don't think that was such a good idea. Overall the plot seemed a bit unfinished to me. Perhaps if the movie was longer and the characters where more evolved it would've been better.But yeah, there is always something to complain about. Everything else, and I mean everything else in this movie was absolutely over the top! The CGI is perfect, the actors play very realistic, the film has humor, it is thrilling, in short: everything you could wish from a movie like this. That's why I believe everyone who liked the first two parts should watch this.

YAY! Spiderman 3 is the Hollywood blockbuster with the biggest ever budget, $258 million on production alone (That's cast, filming, editing and special effects, but no advertisement or distribution) which made the previous record holder, King Kong ($207million) look like a cheap tramp.The money is well spent; the special effects and CGI are amazing, sometimes indistinguishable from the actors or background. The fight sequences are the best in the series so far and with not one, not two, but three bad guys there are a few of them.Spider-man's new costume is the source of his (totally lame) internal battle sub-plot. It was fused to him and is made of a symbiote which later becomes venom. Venom is Eddie Brock Junior who That 70s Show fans will recognise as Eric 'Dumbass' Foreman. Played by Topher Grace, Brock puts on a good performance in this film and is, for a change, a scrawny Venom host, as opposed to the muscle-bound Eddie Brock from the comics.The second (of three) in the Green Goblin dynasty appear, small hint its Harry Osborn (or New Goblin) played by James Franco. Franco tries to replicate the madness of the original Green Goblin and fails, this is because Willem Defoe is a great actor and James Franco isn't.The Sandman also makes and appearance and is revealed to have more to do with Parker's past than first thought. This character's story is one of justification and redemption and his appearance is a throwback to ancient Marvel Comic history (1963 was his first appearance). Other references to Spider-man's past are Gwen Stacey who was Parker's girlfriend long before Mary-Jane; she was killed on an infamous bridge scene by Norman Osborn. There is also a cameo by Stan Lee.With more humour and greater love conflict than the previous films, Spider-man 3 also manages to be gut wrenchingly patriotic. I think the point the movie is trying to make that valour and modesty triumph over dominance. This eventually leads Spidey back to his original costume (and personality) but in my opinion the new costume and take-no-prisoners attitude were just what the young Peter Parker needed. Well worth watching, even just for the battle scenes, however it does stand up on its own and some prick in the audience did stand up and clap at the end of the movie. I give Spider-man 3 7 blobs of tar out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I mean compared to the first 2, this is just terrible. I know everybody thinks it's all Sam Raimi's fault but he admitted that it wasn't, he didn't have any control! Once Toby Maguire puts on the mysterious black suit(which came out of nowhere) the movie gets so gay that you cant help but laugh. He dresses like an EM and dances everywhere! Down the street and all! Then there was Mary Jane who was soooooooooo annoying and whiny through the WHOLE movie. I hated her. Topher Grace was probably the worst character in the entire movie. He made Venom so unbelievable that it wasn't even funny. Many scenes were also pointless, e.g Aunt May explains how she met uncle Ben. WHO CARES! The sub-plot in which Sandman was the real killer.WHY?! The only good things about this movie is Sandman who was played well. James Franco who pulled of being the Green Goblin II and J.K Simmons as Mr. Jamenson who always makes you laugh and fits the roll once again like a glove. Hopfully Sam Raimi can clean up this mess.

It is still a good film, but everything passes so quickly its hard to take it whats really going on. Spiderman 2 succeeded in where it paced the film correctly. Each character (including villains) was given the proper amount of time to flesh them out and built perfectly for Spiderman 3, although the same success is nowhere to be seen.In this film, the main problem is that no characters are given adequate screen time, and you are just overloaded with too much characters and information, which somewhat stops your enjoyment at times. You don't really sympathise or get involved with the characters, which is the main part of what makes a good film. There seems to be no real villain in this film, since harry is evil, but then not. Sandman is just someone who is sorry for himself and so basically takes it out on others, no real evil intentions. The real villain was Venom and darker side of Parker, but then they were given so little time in the film it was disappointing, since they could have been so much more. Characters that shone and stood out in the second film return without their flare. Jonah Jameson in particular, in contrast to the second film is just boring, with no energy and humour like before, and there are points in the film where Harry seems to have returned to being a boy all over again instead of a man. Christopher Young does a horrible job with the music, which played a big part in Spiderman 2 adding liveliness and atmosphere, but in this film Elfman's score is broken here and there and fused with Young's own score, which was at times far too corny and cheesy, and loud and garish when it needn't be.There were still glimpses of brilliance throughout the film though, Maguire plays out the darker side of Parker really well, and it was just such a shame for it to be over so quickly. The fight scenes and CGI were good as usual, but the final confrontation with Venom was lacking. In the end, the film is just a good film. Its not as bad as some people say, since they were expecting something spectacular since the first two films were amazing - as was I, but this film did fail to deliver. I expected this film to blow me away. Only it didn't. The tie ups to some of the characters plots were weak and leave you with something to be desired, as with the ending.It is really a shame since this film could have been so much more. Its sad to know that Spiderman 3 is the last for Maguire and others of the cast, since Spiderman 4 would have been a great chance to patch things up, and because of the ending, there's not so much going on anymore allowing the storyline in Spiderman 4 to focus on a new villain and storyline. In conclusion, the trilogy ends by hitting the ground walking, when it should have been swinging and soaring.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If anything I was hoping that the third Spiderman Film would be like the first and not the second and be a great film. I was disappointed big time.A lot is going on in terms of the plot. Harry flies around on a flying disc as the New Goblin and gets his short term memory messed up after Peter Parker throws him into the ground. Parker then decides he wants to propose to Mary Jane. Meanwhile, a runaway jail escapee gets mixed up with sand molecules and becomes the Sand Man. An evil symbiote from Outer Space merges with Parkers Spiderman suit and creates an eviler symbiote version of Spiderman that is all black. Also, Mary Jane has issues with Parker, the true identity of Ben Parkers killer is discovered, and Parker gets sharp competition for his photography job.First of all, I think the plot and story was bad. It had good parts to it, I think it is interesting how the Symbioate merged with Spiderman. ALso I liked how Parker decided to try to propose to Mary Jane. But there seemed to be too much going on. There were too many side stories and lame parts in the film that seemed to not need to be included.In the second SPiderman film I complained that Parker was not Spiderman enough in the film. In this film I think that is an issue once again. Spiderman is not seen enough. It is all about Peter Parker once again, that was OK I guess for one film but it really disappointed me how in this film Spiderman does not show up enough again.The Villains I think were too underdeveloped in this film. The Sandman gets an OK explanation, but not good enough. The Sandman was an interesting choice but I did not think that he had a good portrayal. You hear about his family and his motives resulting because of his family but it just seemed like something was lacking. Also I think that there were too many villains and with no development that is a major issue for me.Venom also appears in this film. I like Venom a lot and he really is one of the greatest villains ever in Marvel History. Actually I think he is the best. But he should not have been second fiddle to any villain let alone THE SANDMAN as he is in this film. Venom should have been a major villain and in this film he is not in it enough. I liked what he looked like, but the guy playing him did a bad job I think also.I did like how the Symbiote infected Spiderman and made him do bad things. But they should have built on that idea more.THe action was OK at times also. Like when Spiderman was fighting the Sandman the first time it was pretty cool. Also I thought the fight with Venom looked cool at times. But nothing too spectacular.So, I think this was a disappointment for the most part. It was OK at times, but should have been so much better. All I can say to finish, is that I hope that Venom gets to be in another film so that he gets the film depiction that he really deserves. I really do not strongly recommend this film, but it is not that bad either. Worth seeing once.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Stunning action, well introduced characters and a lot of heart.The first 45 minutes are used to introduce the new characters and to show the changing of old characters. Why do people think that characters like Aunt May have to be introduced in every movie? Haven't seen the first two, huh?Why do you think that there are too many plots? Even if there are many plots - watch Crash for example- Or Babel. Can you recognize something?I agree that Venom comes too short in this movie. It would have been better to see a 180 minute movie but I think that there is a Director's Cut coming. So for a theatrical version, SM3 is one of the best movies in 2007...yet.So, do not be stupid.

It was incredibly riveting and the cinematography was never corny the way it tends to be with many superhero films and especially Sam Raimi films. It was a landmark. Spider-Man 3 is fine, but it just doesn't hit as hard. I'm not feeling anything for it right now. I know it's a good movie, but I saw it yesterday and I forgot until now to write my review. It's not a forgettable movie in the sense that you're indifferent the entire time. It's just another comic book flick.I think part of the problem is that I'm for some odd reason fickle in my viewpoints on several things in this movie, and I'm usually very hard-headed about what I think of a movie, right down to the last frame. For instance, the story seems very contrived and constructed rather than led to, but on another hand, the almost ad-libbing, seemingly improvised script draws interest from the audience. Examples include that there's a Sand Man, but there's also an alien venom. Or that Harry still wants revenge for his father's death and won't listen, but he will, but he won't. Peter gets pushed around and handles it in unpredictable, self-destructive ways, but will Spider-Man still save the day? The audience desperately wants to know, not just for their sake but for the togetherness of the movie, how all of these strands are handled and woven together by the end.Another thing I'm torn about is the episode of the film dealing with the venomized spidersuit, where Spider-Man is influenced by the black alien venom. This isn't a spoiler, so don't worry. You see that in the trailer. My problem with it is that that is my favorite part of the movie, because I enjoy everything he does when he wears this venomized suit. I think the audience is supposed to like certain things he does to an extent and certain parts of it are meant to be productive to him and thus making the venom addictive, but I happen to commend all the vindication and rebellion by him in the duration of this part.I'm certain of a few things, though. One of them is how the Sandman, played by the odd casting choice of Thomas Haden Church, comes to be the Sandman. It's ridiculous, completely not believable, and even though one can't fault a superhero movie for being a superhero movie, there are certain things that need to be believable. I can't stand not giving it away in order to explain it, but I want those who are reading these reviews on here to be able to use them for what they're meant to be used for: Persuasion and direction of one's expectations. The reviews with spoiler alerts serve no purpose, because you can only read them after you've seen it. What's the point? Anyway, I do however find a lot of the special effects pertaining to the Sandman to be awesome, especially in the first scene where he appears, falling apart but still moving and gathering up again.So the verdict is that Spider-Man 3 does not surpass its predecessor and perhaps in film series that are constructed continuations for the sake of franchise rather than large-scale stories that last that long to be told simply can't be as memorable because of how many times we've seen the same characters already, almost like an episode in a television series. But, it is very entertaining in that fast, fun, undemanding Hollywood way.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But back to this one, Spider Man 3 was fairly good because there were more villains and a few more cool action scenes than the second but some parts were just brainless and unnecessary like when he begins to convert to the dark side and he begins to dance and act cooler around everyone, I almost fell asleep during that 15 minutes of the movie. But if you can manage to get through that 15 minutes without turning it off, then the rest of the movie is actually pretty good. Overall I give it a 7 out of 10 because the action was great and there was more than the second, but it did have some dull moments where it seemed like the director was trying to kill time and make it longer. I would recommend this to all superhero and action fans like me, especially if you liked the first two films.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I thought he was all well and good until the movie came out, which sowed doubt in my mind about the whole license. If Spiderman is being true to the source material then I have been utterly tricked. Out and out, Spiderman is the biggest pansy ever committed to the silver screen.While I hate to tarnish 75 years of tradition (or however long Spiderman has been in circulation), I feel that it has to be said that Spiderman has no edge. He takes one in this film but it's funny how this plays out. He acts like an evil emo hipster who does evil things like expose rival photographer's unethical photoshopping techniques (MY GOD PARKER, HOW COULD YOU), and then obsesses about how Sandman's gun went off in Uncle Ben's belly but for Parker to wish for his death is totally unbecoming. Especially amusing is the way that Parker snaps at the landlord who caustically reminds Parker that the rent is due - ""You'll get your rent when you fix your door!"" As if it was morally questionable in any sense to demand what you are promised, or set wrongs right, or god forbid, wish for someone's death every now and then (you know you have similar thoughts about someone at work). I understand Parker is a pure character... and yet the pragmatist in me utterly condemns him.

Venom and Sandman are well done, but some of the background CGI(buildings and such)during the action scenes actually made me cringe. Its as if they didn't have the budget to properly do the backgrounds.Plus you get a really wimpy Venom.As for the action, well, its nothing we haven't seen before. Performances are on par with 1 and 2, actually for me, the high point of the movie was watching Tobey run around acting like a jerk..(hilarious).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I blame Batman for starting this trend. Remember when Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher's Batman sequels started inserting the same amount of villains as the numeral for the sequel? Hey Hollywood, if one villain doesn't make the film interesting enough, inserting two or three extra foes won't improve the quality of the film! How many guys does Spidey fight in this film? A dude who can turn into sand, a living costume and then the next guy the costume attaches itself to, his former best friend who is now a psychotic pretty boy from ""Party of Five"" and did I forget anyone else? And if that wasn't enough, there's a huge love triangle between Spidey, a hot red-head, and a hot blonde. It's as if Sam Raimi found his 50 favorite Spider-Man comic books and tried to merge them all into one film. After the movie slows down (like when the credits roll), I realize I was just tricked into watching another summer popcorn film that decided to abandon any serious approach to a comic superhero in favor of a two hour battle royale. And one more thing... the rumor is that Tobey Maguire will never again don the blue and red spandex, and after watching him with his new alcoholic flabby jaw, I've come to realize dude is not aging well. Like Ralph Macchio, he has that eternal baby face, and it looks straight up scary on a guy who is entering his 30's. I also think Maguire has only one acting method -- the shy spaced out prepubescent style -- and it was ""cute"" in his first films, but it's annoying as he reaches mid-life crisis. Yeah... like Hulk, Punisher, Batman and other popular comic film franchises, I think it's time to throw this one back in the blender, and see what new remake concepts Hollywood can come up with.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Too many plot threads; Less likeable characters","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9173537/?ref_=tt_urv","JosephInfantino144","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur158337995/?ref_=tt_urv","8 July 2023","Many sequels are inferior to their predecessors due to laziness. Spider-Man 3 is not one of those sequels, at least in its components. The product as a whole feels lazy and half-baked, but that's primarily the result of too many ideas and plot threads being crammed into one movie. There are a few genuinely terrific moments and storylines in this movie, but unfortunately they don't amalgamate into a cohesive whole.Let's throw some positives into the mix: the visuals are great, and I think the art style overall is the most consistent and realized of the trilogy. Additionally, the dialogue is noticeably better with regards to there being fewer cheesy lines. This is especially apparent in scenes between Peter and MJ. They have more realistic dialogue in this one that escapes the hackneyed ""hopeful romantics"" style dialogue littered in the first two movies. The acting isn't great across the board, but Tobey Maguire is great to watch in this movie. I'm not saying I like his character's decisions here, but working with the choices the script gives him, Maguire shines more than ever before.Now regarding what hurts the film, the script and theming are all over the place. Did you think they wouldn't be able to top Dr. Ock from the last movie? Well, this movie has three villains! Actually, kind of 2 1/2 villains when you think about it. But still, more villains than the last time! This, I feel, was the mindset behind the director and producers of this film, and it makes me wonder how they're the same people that made Spider-Man 2, a good movie and exceptional sequel. What made it a standout sequel was that it expanded not just on quantity (in the form of higher stakes and more action scenes) but also on the quality of the story, characters, and theming. Spider-Man 3 ups the quantity factor to a fault, at the expense of quality. None of the story threads have the breathing room to be fully explored or realized, and there are several that the film tries juggling all at once. As a result, the care factor is jeopardized: the audience can only care about so much in one film without being overstimulated with an excess of plot lines.Moreover, the excess jeopardizes character progression. I honestly feel like we didn't need Venom in this. His presence feels like an afterthought, especially when his role only kickstarts a little over an hour into the film. Not only is he unnecessary, but he detracts from what progression we could have gotten in Peter's character. Venom significantly changes Peter's character through the second half of the movie (I will refrain from specifics to avoid spoilers). What stinks about this is that Peter is no longer in control of his own story. Venom is making Peter do things unaligned with his values. And by the film's end, what does Peter learn? He learns that Venom was not good for him, yes. But what does he learn about himself? How does he grow in this one? That's what hurts this movie. In the first two movies, Peter is significantly different from the start of the movie to the end. But here? Here he just has this villainous symbiote to attribute blame for his actions, almost absolving him of responsibility- which is extremely ironic given the whole theme of the franchise.All in all, I find Spider-Man 3 to be a blatant example of the whole being less than the sum of its parts. There's plenty of potential scattered throughout the film, but this potential is squandered by too much crammed into one movie, resulting in half-baked messages, characters, and storylines. It is a letdown from the highs of Spider-Man 2.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I had high hopes for Spider-man 3 which in my opinion was the worst of the trilogy. It was somewhat entertaining but the movie ended up being a big disappointment. I'll start off with the good before going into what I think went wrong with Spider-man 3. It starts off great with a blistering Ariel fight/chase sequence between Peter and Harry who has taken his father's Goblin persona. I thought the whole cast did an admirable job in their roles Tobey Maguire is good as Peter Parker and Spider-man. Kristen Dunst is okay as Mary Jane although she's not given much to do except look angry and whine, James Franco is solid as both a hero and a super villain who's finally given something to do. Thomas Haden Church gives an equally impressive performance as Flint Marko but unfortunately he's not in it all that much considering his CGI counterpart takes over for large parts of his scenes. Church doesn't have much dialogue either. Topher Grace does his usual thing as Eddie Brock but he makes for a terrible Venom no offense. I just couldn't buy him being a sinister super villain. Thomas Haden Curch actually would've been better in that role or maybe Vin Disiel. Bryce Dallas Howard does her best as Gwen Stacy in a role that seems to be entirely wasted and the rest of the cast turn in good performances including J. K Simmons who continues to steal every scene he's in as J. Jonah Jameson. Spider-man 3 had everything going for it then about an hour into it things go from bad to worse and it goes downhill from there. Now to the bad it feels like Sam Raimi who is a fantastic filmmaker tried to put too much into one movie. Peter Parker's turn to the dark side because of the symboite had potential and did bring much comic relief to the film but it wasn't as interesting as it should have been and the humor started to get a little silly after a while. Also the introduction of three villains was a bit much (The New Goblin, Sandman, and Venom not to mention the enemy within himself). With the exception of Harry's Goblin who was well developed, Sandman and Venom lacked development and screen time. Which brings me to the biggest disappointment about Spider-man 3 is Venom. Director Sam Raimi had stated he disliked the character but was coerced to include him in the film. Well his disinterest in the character shows. I'll admit I'm not the biggest Venom fan but I do know he's one of Spider-man's most iconic and dangerous villains. I was pretty excited when I found out he was going to be in this film but I ended up being very disappointed considering he gets at the most 8 to 10 minutes of screen time. He doesn't show up until extremely late into the movie and only gets one fight with Spider-man at the end that lasts probably about a total of fifteen seconds since Venom disappears for much of the final battle at the end. He's easily defeated and wasn't that much of a threat like he was in the comics. If the film had cut out Sandman leaving Harry and Venom as the main villains the movie to me would've been a lot better considering except for Harry, Sandman and Venom are just poorly developed. Overall Spider-man 3 is a decent film with some okay action sequences but they never last long except for the first fight between Harry and Peter and then the anti-climatic battle at the end. But the movie failed to live up to my expectations and was a major disappointment. Maybe Spider-man 4 if they do indeed make another one will give us the Spider-man movie we've been waiting for with a compelling story, well developed characters, menacing villains, and more action.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

About one third of the people there were children. I would like to know whether this sequel aimed to attract just children and adults who are mentally not more mature than children. In whole sequel emotions, messages, characters are not beyond the complexity that a ten year old can easily understand. Especially in this third movie these are more easy to see. Look how inner turmoil of spidey is depicted: he wears black clothes, changes his hairstyle, and joins the dark side. Was all these arranged so just to explain the change in spidey's character to seven year old boys? Seeing those scenes people in the theatre could not help laughing. I am sure that Sam Raimi knows well that even a teen experiences his turmoils far deeper and do not wear black when he changed some of his opinions. especially upon seeing the dark knight I am sure that this man do not aim to make a respectable film of our hero but he just wants to exploit him to make money easily. He knows the children are not like adult cinema-goers, they will certainly come when they hear that a new spidey is shot and furthermore each child will bring his parents together so making the film for children is really profitable. This is why he even did not try to make a serious, respectable film out of spidey.

It's time for the summer movie season. Let's get this out of the way first: this is the summer of the sequel. Of the ten most hyped movies in the next four months, eight of them are sequels, and seven of those are at least the third in the series. Sequels are a tricky business, because there are often massive built-in expectations and points of reference. They can't be too similar to the prequels without risking boredom, but if they stray too far from the tone of the original, they risk alienating their audiences. Like last year's summer season, this year kicks off with the third movie in a blockbuster series. In 2006, the first out of the gate was ""Mission: Impossible 3""; in 2007, it is ""Spider-Man 3"".When we last left Spidey three years ago, he had rid the world of Doctor Octopus, and had his identity revealed to his two closest friends, his girlfriend Mary Jane and his buddy/enemy Harry Osborn, whose father was the Green Goblin in the original picture. ""SM3"" picks up not long after, in a New York City where Spider-Man has gone glam, with his name and image plastered all over the media. Peter Parker relishes his newfound fame, so much that it begins to impede his relationship with Mary Jane. As that hits the rocks, he finds himself vulnerable at an inopportune time, which leads to the chaos that forms the crux of the movie.One strong point of the movie is that is has the same principal cast as first two and also possesses a continuous story arc. Both features (think about it) are actually rarities among superhero trilogies. That definitely helps in the continuity department, because the characters, locations, and relationships are familiar. On the downside, the similarities amplify the fact that little of the movie is original. We've seen Spidey swoop and soar through city canyons, and we've seen him fight nasty villains. With the exception of an early chase scene, nothing is particularly different, either in style or content. That's disappointing, as a Spider-Man movie begs to be exhilarating. Say what you will about the vastly different styles of the three Mission: Impossibles, but each of them had a unique feel that individually defined each movie and made like events more interesting.While the lack of novelty is disappointing, the most significant attempt at being unique provides the most unusual portion of the movie. As Parker/Spidey undergoes a transformation in the middle act, the movie takes a bizarre turn into romantic comedy. The idea is commendable; too few movies take too few chances. But this one doesn't work. For twenty minutes you understand what is happening, but still can't quite believe it. It would be like if Golden State had gone into a stall offense when they were up 20 against Dallas last night. Sure, it makes sense given the circumstances, but it still feels completely wrong and out of place.The bigger problem is the end consequence of the emotional speed bump. It's something very rare in superhero movies: Peter Parker is not likable. Granted, that is part of the point, but when one starts disliking the title character, one loses interest in the movie, and that is huge strike against this kind of flick.Like the later Batman installments, ""SM3"" also has too many characters and stories for one movie. Instead of completely marginalizing the hero like ""Batman & Robin"" did, ""SM3"" races through the stories of the antagonists. Two of the three could easily have filled the requisite two-plus hours in finer fashion. Then the villains' stories could have been fleshed out better to create the rare well-rounded superhero movie. Not only that, but Peter Parker's issues could have been expanded as well, in a manner more like its predecessors. One of the taglines for the movie is The Battle Within, and that promising fight unfortunately is not fully addressed, though in a pleasant surprise, numerous positive themes of responsibility and choice are.Having said all that, I must provide the disclaimer that Spider-Man just doesn't do it for me. Batman does; Superman does; but Spider-Man doesn't. Maybe it has to do with Tobey Maguire's relatively diminutive stature, that I don't believe he could be a butt-kicking hero. Maybe the face-covering mask dehumanizes Spider-Man for me. Whatever.People won't care that much; ""Spider-Man 3"" will still make a webful of money. If you like the other two Spider-Man movies, you'll enjoy this one, which isn't painful to watch. There are plenty of characters and eventually plenty of action. But ""Spider-Man 3"" matches its predecessors ways it shouldn't and doesn't match them in ways it should.Bottom Line: 6 of 10 for the first big release of the summer and perhaps the final Spider-Man movie. Not bad, but nothing special.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is awful.I grew up with comics and although Spidey has never been my favorite (I am a Wolverine Fan)I always appreciated the complexities of the character both as spider-man and as Peter Parker.I think that the main flaw of this film has to be the director and the screenwriters. In both the previous films I thought that Tobey Maguire was quite a good choice for Spidey, but in this film he just constantly got on my nerves. He just comes across as way too geeky and his dark persona just too cheesy rather than dark. All during the film the whole of the cinema was laughing but not with the film but at the film.On the plus side: Venom...good, Sandmand...good, fights...decent but not spectacular.All in all, I think it was a waste of money.

Listen, just because it isn't a two-and-a-half-hour action sequence, but instead actually contains a very well thought-out plot and a lot of emotional backing, doesn't mean you have to automatically hate it.Did nobody pay attention to the first two movies? Peter Parker was always a righteous person, so why isn't anybody moved or surprised when the symbiote fills him with rage and hate? Nobody found this interesting? Or were they too busy complaining to their buddies about the ""relationship scenes"" to pay attention to this major part of the film? Which reminds me, did nobody know that Peter wants to propose to Mary Jane in this movie? WHY are people upset at the amount of scenes involving their relationship? A superhero movie doesn't need to be nothing but macho beat-em-up nonsense, it can have a plot or, God forbid, a love story, too. Oh, and I'm sorry that the action scenes that WERE included were by far the best out of any of the movies.So stop whining about the love scenes and the dialogue, because this was by far the best Spider-Man movie out of the three, and had the best plot, themes, and character development out of any of them.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

I still believe they had too much on their plate; there were too many subplots running at the same time.There was this Sandman's introduction, Harry's due vengeance and then Venom.

I loved 2. 3, however, is the weakest movie. It is entertaining and has many strong elements, but it has a fair share of weaknesses, some forgivable and some not.My biggest issue was with the villains. They are all interesting and all deserve a whole movie to themselves. Instead they battle for time, and in the end neither the Sandman nor Venom come out very developed. Venom especially feels like an afterthought, tacked on to the story at the last minute. How tacked on? Well, I'll just say that the movie doesn't even spend enough time with the character to let us know that he goes by the name ""Venom."" My second issue was with the ending (which I won't spoil). I'll just say some things are wrapped up too nicely and other things left hanging in such a way that I didn't feel satisfied.Still, it was well acted and directed. The action sequences are fantastic. It's funny when it wants to be (another great part by Bruce Campbell). I recommend it despite being disappointed.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

This has him ready to marry fiancée Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) but things (LOTS of things) start to happen. The new Green Goblin (James Franco) is trying to kill him thinking Spidey killed his dad. The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) shows up to...something (the movie's really not clear on that) and an alien symbiote turns Spidermans' costume black and turns Parker AND Spiderman evil. Then Venom (Topher Grace) shows up later on.Talk about overdone! TOO many villains, too many plot lines (and plot holes), WAY too violent, too long (the longest one of the series) and surprisingly dull. As always the special effects are incredible but the dialogue and stories are still at a dumb comic book level. Maguire surprisingly acts (a little) here. He was blank in the first two movies but here he actually smiles. However when he's called to play a badass guy it's hysterically bad. I was laughing out loud! Dunst was good in the first two--here she's just blank. Also she sings two songs--that was NOT a good idea! Dunst just can't really sing. Church was lousy as Sandman. He speaks in a monotone and never changes expression. Grace was GREAT as Venom but he can't save the film. Franco seems sort of confused in his role and his 180 degree turnaround towards the end didn't make sense. As I said it's WAY too violent for a PG-13. A few of the fights Spidey has would have easily killed him. But it's the multiple (bad) story lines, bad acting and length really sink it. A 1 all the way.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

He discovered the symbiote costume in a facility in the world where a whole host of Marvel heroes and villains had been sent by the Beyonder to battle.In Raimi's film, the costume finds its way into Parker's bedroom, the alien substance attaching itself to Parker (Tobey Maguire), lending him a new costume which in turn lends him a far greater  albeit more dangerous  power. The costume also changes his characteristics, making him more confident, arrogant and at times  aggressive. It is at the bell tower scene where he loses the costume to reporter Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). Parker realizes the costume is vulnerable to high pitched sounds. Brock has been humiliated by Parker, while Parker is under the influence of the black costume, and follows him to the church. Brock becomes venom, one of Spider-Man's most deadly foes.The second villain to appear in Spider-Man is the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), a criminal who is caught in an experiment gone wrong; his physical state is that of a malleable sand-like substance that can be shaped according to the Sandman's will.The third is the return of the Green Goblin, the character this time taken by Harry Osborne (James Franco) after his father (Willem Dafoe) died in the first movie.Villains aside, the other storyline is the ongoing troubles between Peter and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst), their relationship still on the slide here, and not eased by Parker's new-found powers born out of the symbiote~alien costume. Even the villains claim some small shred of empathy in Spider-Man 3, their own personal lives being as troubled as Parker's, or else their lives affected by the symbiote~webslinger.As a bonus there is the Gwen Stacy~Captain Stacy (James Cromwell) storyline, Gwen being the girl who attempts to steal Spider-Man's affections from MJ ~ Too many villains, some say? I thought this was almost as good as the first movie (the origin). The scene from the bell tower  taken frame-by-frame from the original comic  was as well-made as the 'Spider-Man No More' sequence in 'Spider-Man 2'.Action-packed yet dark and Gothic in places, Spider-Man 3 is another triumph for Sam 'Evil Dead' Raimi.Also stars Bill Nunn (Robbie Robertson), J K Simmons (an amazing transformation as J Jonah Jameson), Bruce Campbell (Maître d'), Teddy Raimi, Emma Raimi, Lorne Raimi and Henry Raimi.Matthew J Lee-Williams, Review.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Spider Man was a light, entertaining action film with likable characters that were fairly well developed. It was very well made, and though it had fantasy elements, it stayed grounded in reality. Spider Man 2 was even better. The characters were more fleshed out, the special effects and action scenes improved, and the writing was tremendous (probably thanks to Michael Chabon).Then along came Spider Man 3 (no pun intended). This was the movie that I was most looking forward to this summer, and it was a huge letdown. There are numerous problems with the film: 1) Too many villains. While I'm sure many comic book fans (I'm not one of them) were enthused about the New Goblin, Venom, and Sandman being in the third film, it's just too much.2) Too much fantasy. Like I mentioned before, the first two films had fantasy elements, but remained grounded in reality. But when Sandman becomes this enormous mass of sand (with tires and other debris thrown in) it just crosses the line and is, again, too much. In fact, too much could sum up the whole movie. It tries for so much and utterly fails.3) Ridiculous plot elements. So a meteorite crashes, out comes this black goo, it latches onto Peter, and it makes him emo. Meteorite goo makes him emo. Does that make sense to anyone? 4) Lack of character development. Too much action (there we go again with ""too much"") and not enough character elements. Aunt May seemed to have a smaller part than usual, and the attempts by the writers to flesh out the new characters (like Sandman) just fall flat.5) Plot holes. Why did the butler keep his mouth shut for so long? Why did Peter want Gwen to kiss him, when it is obvious it would make MJ jealous? Why didn't MJ tell Peter about the play? 6) It's not even fun to watch. The action gets tiring, and all the joy is sucked out.Go see the movie as a continuation of the series, but go in with low expectations. If you're expecting a film on the level of Spider Man 2, you're going to be let down.P.S. Bruce Campbell is the best thing about this film.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I like this movie just like I like Spider-Man 2 it has drama, sci-fi elements and action in it. The movie is like Superman III get's crap on it, for no good reason, I always liked this film. It is not better than Spider-Man 1 and 2 but it is in lighter category decent - underrated.I like the bond between those three leads Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco. This movie is about revenge, transformation in to bad Spidey on a dark side. It has dark tone and it has redemption by the end of the movie. Sam Raimi returned with direction of the third movie in which he helped to write a script with his brother Ivan and Alvin Sargent who wrote a script for Spider-Man 2. Spider-Man at least did not kill Gwen Stacy like he did in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 and than Garfield wined like some school kid over his toy. So yea I like this movie it is a decent Kirsten Dunst is still excellent as Mary Jane Watson she is jealous on Peter/Spider-Man but I like that in the movie. I like the soundtrack playing on the end of credits: Signal Fire by Snow Patrol.I like the action sequences in which Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire) in black suit fights Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) in underground station I like the sequence in which Spider-Man glues on trains, I like that so much. I like Spider-Man in black suit hanging on a church I like that sequence. Spider-Man fights off Venom (Topher Grace) and he fights with Sandman while trying to help Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). I like Harry Osborn in which he turns in to New Goblin but helps out Peter fighting two monsters, I like that in the movie. He blamed Peter for his father's death but on the end he helped out his best friend Peter.In my opinion those trio did a good job respectfully playing their characters: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst and James Franco like they are actually friends. Topher Grace as Eddie Brock / Venom was perfect bad guy too me, just like right from the comic books. They filmed now Venom (2018) with Tom Hardy how will that movie work without Spider-Man? I have no idea but I will check that movie out. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy was to me better than Emma Stone. Bryce didn't look like some rich model she was a normal girl a classmate from Peter Parker and I like that in the movie. I like Bryce Dallas Howard in Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom (2018) who also gets crap for it and I like her in this movie a lot.About actor James Franco I grew up watching him in his movies Spider-Man trilogy and Whatever It Takes (2000) those were the movies I watched in high school. They are big part of me growing up. I heard accusation about Franco's sexual harassment allegations. Actress Ally Sheedy accused him why she left the movie business on twitter, but deleted those tweets. Than like 5 other woman come forward and continue accusing Franco about sexual harassment. The most ridicules to me is an actress I don't know her name was upset because she had to be naked in Franco's movie, but she was pay $100 at day. It is ridicules because she sign a contract and she was pay. Why making that allegations? It is stupid! I support James Franco 100% so what he made a mistakes and he shouldn't be judged. I respect and support the guy.I know people complained because there were too many villains in it and because Peter was dancing. They did not like the Twist dancing in which Harry and Mary Jane dancing. I did not mind anything in the film and I like it. It is hell way better than The Amazing Spider-Man 1 and 2. Spider-Man 3 is underrated. I forgive you - means in the movie after Peter finds the real killer of his uncle Ben the guy apologized and Peter forgives him, because that's what he does Spider-Man doesn't kill people he saves them.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The story goes that this film's screenplay was originally intended to span two films with Ben Kingsley already lined up to play the Vulture who would have been the primary villain of the first film. One would then assume that Parker wouldn't have ditched his black suit until the finale, saving Venom to be the main contender of the follow up. This is what should have been done. Venom is a very cool character for many more reasons than his appearance, but his screen time is kept so short here that nobody outside of the comic fans know it. Comic fans are sad he's not in it more...everyone else wonders why he was in it at all. Because of the hodgepodge of activity crammed into the story he's reduced to a two dimensional character who is ultimately defeated too fast to promote any real threat.But like I said, in spite of it's faults this is a very entertaining movie and given the volume of material Raimi and his team had to juggle with they did a remarkable job of presenting it. There's a ton of action, lots of humor and amazing special effects. The plot of course does not live up to the standards of the first two and that is it's main downfall...but to be fair the first two set the bar fairly high. This franchise isn't dead though and I imagine everyone's learned from their mistakes, I can't wait for number 4.If you like fun action movies this is a fun ride.

The plot was weak and there were scenes that took up time but didn't really further the plot at all. If I had been watching it at home I would have turned it off about half way through.

I've seen it three times in theater so far! I think a lot of the users had their own version of Spiderman 3 made in their head, and when Sam Raimi's version didn't completely fulfill all their wildest fantasies, they whine and complain about a great entry into the Spiderman series. Now on to the movie.The acting was great. I think everyone involved did an amazing job at delivering comic book dialogue. The new actors seemed to flowed very well with the ones that have already been in the Spiderman world for awhile. Everyone seemed to fit the role they were cast for perfectly, especially Topher Grace even though his character didn't receive the attention he deserved. That was really my only complaint with the whole movie. Hopefully we will see more of Venom in future installments. The special effects were way above par as we've come to expect from these movies. If there is anyone who doesn't believe that you need to re watch the climatic battle royal, which happens to be one of the best action sequences I've seen in the last few years.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The 3 villains in it could have confused the storyline, they could have got caught up with the special effects and just made it a showcase of that. They could have crushed everything that was built up over the last two films. But they didn't!No, they didn't forget the formula that made the last films so great. They didn't forget the balance of the love story and drama in the films with the action scenes and the special effects. They didn't forget all the reasons why we loved Spiderman 1 and 2 and that for me is why this film is so great. I have to tell you that it all worked perfectly. The 3 story lines worked around each other and you never got lost and then all came together for one amazing finale. The characters were all awesome. Each one played their part so well, it was like finally seeing a comic book on the screen the way it should be done. Kirsten Dunst was amazing, as always. Topher Grace was a brilliant Venom/ Eddie Brock, Thomas Haden Church was brilliant as Sandman/ Flint Marko and James Franco was just great as Green Goblin MK2/ Harry Osbourne. And then there is Tobey McGuire as Spiderman/Peter Parker. What can i say. It was a genius performance. This was he Peter Parker from the comics, this was the Spideman from the comics. He was a character you could understand what he was going through, understand everything that happened to him, you went on his remarkable journey with him. There were just so many small bits in this film that all came together and that really made it brilliant. However, in spite of what i said above, this film does have its flaws, and some major ones at that. The script isn't all that great but there are some good moments in there. There are some scenes where you wonder, why the hell did they put that in there/ why didn't they do that in the last movie? Some of the dialogue between characters can be just shocking, but hey, its a comic book movie. But one of my major problems with the movie was that fact the this film was way over-hyped and so people expected a lot more than they got, and this is the reason for all those idiots out there saying that this film is either too dark or too cheesy (please make up your minds which one it is because it cant be both).But do you know what, in the end none of this matters because it really is a great film, with some classic scenes. Sure its not as good as Spiderman 2, but that was a difficult act to follow. When you see this film, just sit and enjoy it for what it is. This film will make you laugh, it might even make you cry, but i promise it will have you on the edge of your seat.So don't listen to all the stupid Spideman fan-boys, don't listen to the critics, go and see this movie for yourself, make your own opinion on it.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Some aspects echo its outstanding predecessors while other aspects are downright terrible. Because few movies vary between such extremes of genuine craft and complete disasters from scene to scene, Spider-Man 3 is difficult to evaluate. For starters, the writing is an obvious culprit because the film is structurally overstuffed and tonally inconsistent. However, amidst the corny dialogue and flimsy motivations, the script has its virtues because all the characters have reasonable arcs and there is a through line conflict between Peter and MJ (even if that all feels forced).Meanwhile, the direction and editing deserve criticism because the tone and plot are muddled (complete with some truly cringey sequences), but Raimi's energetic cuts and camerawork still make appearances. The music is noticeably less impactful (and occasionally detrimental), but generally solid. Topher Grace was a casting misfire but everyone else is still great. The special effects overemphasize CGI but Sandman's introduction is visually beautiful. All told, Spider-Man 3 is clearly a letdown compared to its precursors but is better than the backlash indicates. In fact, compared to the landscape of superhero movies today, it's fairly average.Writing: 4/10

And when Parker gets some 'balls' it is nauseatingly odious. This is the worst sort of sequel, a marketing and endorsement exercise with no respect for the source material. When will the studios realise that a film of this ilk can have mass market appeal and a decent narrative? The most expensive film ever made?

I wish I could add something better,but I feel like that sums this up.Now popular and practically the alpha-male,king of the city,Spidey sails about the city practically posing for photos,signing autographs and (last but not least)saving people and thwarting crimes. Peter PArker(Tobey Maguire,still trippy,bug-eyed and youthey. Ahh,some things never change!)can't complain,either:he's the star photog for the newspaper and his love life with longtime flame Mary Jane Watson(Kirsten Dunst,as creamy-skinned and sweet as before)couldn't be better. That's all about to change as a mysterious glob of protoplasm invades his life,turns him into a darker,edgier character with stronger,meaner urges and instincts,virtually alienating everyone he knows and making him a much less personable and friendly neighborhood hero. As this is all happening,an escaped con(Thomas HAden Church)somehow ends up being transformed into a nearly impervious super-villain called SAndman,and his connection to Peter will eventually have him coming to a dangerous head. All this,while a weaselly,ambitious rival photog(Topher Grace,probably doing the most dynamic acting here)finds himself at the point of trying to destroy Parker by any means possible.Director Sam RAimi has this on auto-pilot,and the result is something that has the visual and overall quality of the film to pretty much match the previous two offerings,but overlong,over-loaded with villains and plot contrivances(a possible romantic device involving Bryce Dallas Howard as the bubbly, vivacious police CAptain's daughter seemed a bit much,and James Franco's return as Harry seemed to be somehow squeezed out in the plot,which is wrong),this movie pretty much unhinges the energy and campy fun of the previous two movies. At this point,I'm not sure how(if at all)the Spiderman franchise is going to carry on. I have no doubt it will,but it will be interesting to see if the principal players(THe RAimis--Sam and co-writer Ivan--,Maguire,Dunst,Rosemary Harris as durable Aunt MAy,the awesome J.K. Simmons as JAmeson,Bruce Campbell,etc.)will want to continue this series,and how it will look. For now,anyway,I guess one has to enjoy this movie as a part of the totality of the trilogy,and resign themselves to this movie being somewhat of a letdown. A sometimes breathtaking,energetic and visually stimulating letdown,to be sure,but a letdown all the same.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Although I think these are all three great movies, I found 'Spider-Man 3' to be the weakest in the trilogy.My biggest gripe is 'Spider-Man 3' contains many more story arcs than the prior two entries. This makes for an overall film that is much less focused from a story-telling perspective, containing more shallow plot lines that don't quite get the audience invested in as otherwise could have. There's an old saying ""less is more"" - rather than telling one or two high-quality stories, 'Spider-Man 3' tells very many lower-quality stories. It makes the plot come off as disorganized and scatterbrained.I give 'Spider-Man 3' a 6/10.

""Daddy - why are they dancing and where is the bad guy"" - 11 yr old - from the mouths of babes...If you want to see a bad remake of Grease go see this movie. If instead you want to see a Spiderman movie with a decent plot line, unhurried delivery and excellent character development then please restrict your viewing to Spiderman and Spiderman 2.I still had to consider if I wanted to complete my collection of movies by buying this when it is eventually released but on closer consideration - I have to say NO - like X-Men 3 - this will be one movie never to grace my shelves.High points (well promising): Sandman - very promising character; Goblin - very promising in what he could do; Venom - how I wanted to see more of this guyLow points: Sandman - no real quality time spent on him; except for introduction; Goblin - again no real time spent on his development or delivery; Venom - still waiting to see more Parker-Venom - haircut; dancing; reminded me of a spotty spoilt teenager. Spidey-Venom - well the photos looked great but where is he?In summary this movie really should have been delivered in 2 parts. Part 1 - Sandman and Goblin - more than enough bad guy here. Part 3 - Venom - just imagine how Peter could have played this out - minus the dancing and singing of course - pitiful...

They will love the little details in this movie, cram enough facts and names in any comic movie and they will have an orgasm, any adherence to the comics will earn brownie points with them and from my research I've learned that movie has remained very true to the comic universe and even clear some plot holes from the earlier films.BUT whatever happened to the secret identity at least few thousand people know by now who spider-man is, and by killing of so many characters (goblin for one) they are definitely going to lose some advantage.STILL THIS IS WILL BE THE SECOND MOST SATISFIED DEMOGRAPHIC.THE CRITICS - Satisfying them is even easier than the fans prerequisites are 1) The movie should be long (140 mins in this case) however exceptions are allowed for foreign language films which are all good.2)There should be long boring parts with lots of conversations and deep emotional moments, crying is a must AND BOY IS THERE CRING SPIDERMAN IS CRYING, MJ IS CRYING, HARRY IS CRYING, AUNT IS CRYING, HELL EVEN THE DEAD UNCLE IS CRYING, all this is OK right how else do you please the drama lovers BUT WAIT THERE IS MORE...NOW THE BLOODY Villains ARE CRYING MAN VENOM IS CRYING GOBLIN IS CRYING AND EVEN SANDMAN IS CRYING even apologising for gods sake.ACTING WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE CONSIDERED SUPERB IF THESE CRITERIA ARE MET.BUT it is a big studio movie and with loads of action and special effects that distract from the interesting story of man torn between his 2 lives(sic) hence they wont give the super high rating.Still this will be third happiest demographic.THE ORDINARY MOVIEGOER (alomst me)- We don't really care about the details keep us interested for 105 mins and we are happy, add in some more special effects, some more twists, some more drama and some more eye candy and even 120 mins will do.BUT this movie is 140+ mins there are long stretches of drama and only these many big action scenes and not to mention no eye candy (KIRSTEN LOOKS HIDEOUS).This demographic will be satisfied for now BUT NOT FOR LONG.THE OPINIONATED AND NOSTALAGIC COMMERCIAL MOVIEGOERS - We long for more movies of the kind we like (in my case the simple action movies of the yesteryear's the good guys were good, the bad guys were bad and bloodshed always followed, in between there was some drama, some hot chicks, and some sorrow but in the end the bad guy lost and there were celebrations), IN THIS CASE THIS MOVIE WILL NOT FIT INTO ANYONES IDEAL COMMERCIAL MOVIE.BUT There are once again a fair number of awe-inspiring effects and 6-7 good scenes and we will never really find this movie bad (still gave the lower rating to discourage such movies and not raise expectations).GREAT COMIC SCENE IN THE RESTAURANT.We will be satisfied but have loads of opinions.BLACKS WILL RAISE A CRY ABOUT THE LACK OF BLACK ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE (eventually).AND NOW FOR THE MOST SATISFIED DEMOGRAPHIC.THE CHICKS - If ever there was a chick flick that was parading as an action film this was one.. 1) All the men are sensitive (a less offensive word) and cry (read earlier) women will get MULTIPLE ORGASMS SEEING SUPERSTRONG SENSITIVE MEN. 2)The women are strong characters with loads of advise which turns out to be true, all of them are loved by their men, HELL THEY EVEN ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO THROW A CONCRETE BLOCK TO SAVE Their MAN. 3)There are more kisses, romantic, and tearful moments then the most romantic film ever made.YAY SPIDERMAN IS DANCING.BUT Some people died and they should have reformed and lived liked that other villainStill women WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE.Must stop rambling so heres the verdict.If you will give in to the hype then PROCEED WITH CAUTION.-s read above, CHICK FLICK, not enough satisfying action, too much demographic appeasement,LONG BORING STRETCHES.+/-s CHICK FLICK, you could be in the right demographic.+s decent acting,MIND BOGGLING SPECIAL EFFECTS, something for everyone.total 4/10 (actually its more of a 5-6/10 movie but want to discourage such movies and pull down the hyper inflated rating, it met my highly lowered expectations).","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Overall, I was entertained, but the whole thing did seem more than a bit disjointed and cobbled together. It took forever to get going and the three main story lines didn't really mesh at all until near the end--and even then, the convergence of the three was clumsily handled.It was as if they made three really, really good episodes of a Spiderman TV show, each with its own story arc, and then forcibly edited the them all into one feature film. They used to do this with popular TV shows like ""Man From Uncle"" and ""The Virginian"" back in the 60s.As I watched the story lines of S3 slowly unfold I couldn't help but think that each of them--the Sandman's story, the New Goblin story, and the Venom story--was being shortchanged, and that each would have been better if filled out to about an hour and a half on its own. But when a flick costs about a quarter of a billion bucks, I guess they think you should get at least three movies worth for your ticket money--but I'd rather pay three times and get three really good movies instead!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Due to that it couldn't but be epic, heroic,... Well, it surely does.You haven't seen so many battles, special effects, character twists and brainwashes in previous two parts taken together. You haven't seen so many behaviour clichés without any reasonable motivation and far-fetched links either. It's undoubtedly very hard to pull everything together in one movie and avoid creating a kaleidoscopic slide show, but sometimes screenwriter passes all bounds and creates unnatural event sequences.Notwithstanding all my previous grumbling, there're some marvellous scenes, which you inevitably ought to see. They are completely different from what you've seen in previous parts. No more jolly guessing on how to use the spider web. Even humor is darker, more ambiguous and more... mature (well, it seems to me the only appropriate word). And it's a definite advantage, cause you wouldn't like to see all the same in the whole trilogy. Every part should be distinctive and vivid, grasping your attention with some new attitude to narration and character developing.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

That's as plain as I can put it. It was an all out action flick, then it was an over done drama, oh wait now it's a really campy comedy, but NO, it's a musical too.Spider-man 3 has a lot of action scenes that just come out of nowhere, really long action sequences, that are really had to follow. Remember the fight between DOC OC and Spidey in 2. It was fast paced and you could follow the action, no so in this film. Even when a fight seen is ran in slow motion a.k.a. bullet time the action still isn't clear.On top of that, character don't look realistic while fighting. Spider man looks like rubber during fights, and a lot of the time the New Goblin looks like a bad matte.It seems much of the money spent on this movie went into the action sequences, and the story severely suffers. I think word of mouth will kill this movie. This was supposed to be this summer's first blockbuster, I'm not impressed. After seeing Spider-Man 3, I'm REALLY excited for TRANSFORMERS. I really can't see TRANSFORMERS being worst than Spider-Man 3.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Although Superhero concept is not new. But Spiderman 1 was one of the first film in a decade, to gross revenue lot more than any other movies of the similar concept ever did. The first spiderman paved the way to promising sequels, and if you are a spidey fan you will not regret watching this.The plot, action sequences, screenplay, visual effects and acting were all very well done. The flow of movie was just so perfect, that it kept me entertained throughout the whole movie. They kept the drama, humor, action in such an amazing pace, that you would at times be very serious, or at times be very nervous during action sequences or be bursting into fits of laughter on some classic hilarious scenes! The movie is longer than its predecessors, about two and half hours. But it justifies every minute of it! Highly recommended!","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

At the beginning Pter or Spideman was saying that he had a bad life before in the fit two movies of Spiderman he says in this one that everyone likes him. Then he goes to MJ's play where she sings the most annoying song and then he finds Harry outside the theaters trying to say sorry. Afterwards he mets up with MJ and says she did great on th stag and then there's a scene of Harry turning into the new Goblin. Well that's all I can say for now but I'm trying to say there was like too much going on which makes the movie go over th top of things which is quite annoying. Like the part when they show Sandman running from the cops and then he lands in a pit of and and these people who ar working on something turn Flent into the Sandman. And also when thy introduce the new characters like Gwen Stacey and Eddie Brock I think they don't introduce them properly in a way thy are tying to say thy could of been in the first two Spiderman movies. But I love the part when sandman and Spiderman battle each other especially in the truck and when Petr gets consumed by Venom and turns into a angry but very groovy character trying to be emo and cool. Let's just say this movie is the best movie of the year and it should stay that way!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As for movies - I really liked the first part of the saga, and thought, that second was even better. Maybe because i never have high expectations when i'm going to see a ""popcorn movie"". But the third installment made me wonder either i'm actually watching ""SpiderMan 3"" or some parody/comedy movie on it.. :/ OK, some CGI and especially sound editing are brilliant. But OMG this is one BAD script. Do me a favor - if you haven't seen this movie and planning to see it soon, please count how many times you'll see someone crying or wet-eyed on screen. For god sake i've counted 7 during last 20 minutes. So i guess producers spent more money on tears than they did on CGI... Tobey Maguire was awful. I never liked him actually, but i always thought that ""at least he's good as spiderman"". I was wrong. What's that thing with emo hairstyle when he's poisoned by venom? I wish i had an ever-changing hairstyle depending on my mood :) Anyway, it's pretty valuable as a demo DVD for your audio/video hardware, especially the skyscraper scene, but as a movie it just plain sucks.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

"9","/10","The best of the three (where it counts)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1649795/?ref_=tt_urv","Sarfield-1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7589169/?ref_=tt_urv","5 May 2007","I had read plenty of reviews before going to see Spiderman 3. Not that I actually consider any reviewer's opinion before deciding whether or not to go watch a flick, I was simply curious. Most reviews say the same thing in a nutshell: they tried to cram too much into the movie (3 villains?? insane!), the effects were great but the story was poor. No arguments as far as the effects go. They truly are spectacular, particularly several scenes with the Sandman. They're not the most polished effects I've seen, but they've got remarkable ingenuity - it's a pleasure to watch them. And now to what counts: The story. This is, without a doubt, the best movie in the trilogy when it comes to the story. It's powerful, smart, and retains all of the elements which made the previous films so amazing. As I've mentioned, some people seem to have serious issues with the three villains, and are understandably aggravated by the relatively short screen time Venom received. But unlike Spidey 1 and 2, the villains in this film are much stronger plot elements, rather than 'reasons to have a flashy action scene'. In the previous 2, the villains, while awesome, were replaceable. Perhaps the Goblin had a more important role considering the story arch that Harry goes through, but Doc. Oc had little to do with Peter Parker's character development. He was there as a catalyst for what Pete had to go through, but it could have easily been some other bad guy. It could have been Connors' Lizard (which is what I thought it'd be at first).In this one, however, with the brilliant story they've written, the villains are integral to what happens to Peter and what he does. Which is why, in this film more than any other in the series, I would prefer to not even address them as 'villains'. They each have strong reasons for doing what they do, which are explained in the film, and they each have their shot at Pete. The exception would have to be Harry, who doesn't get much of a back-story to how he behaves. That is understandable, however, and means that one would have to watch the previous two films to fully comprehend what is going on between the two best-friends, Harry and Pete. And then we have Venom. I will obviously not say much about him, except that I believe he was brilliantly portrayed in the film and like everything else in it, his reason for being there is a direct result of the story and it feels right and not pushed in. And as for his screen time - I like to call that the 'Darth Maul' factor. I'll explain. I guess anyone reading this probably knows who Darth Maul is so I'll refrain from providing information about him and get right to the point. When Episode One came out there was the same kind of uproar about Darth Maul's part in the film, which was similarly small as Venom's. But what they failed to realize was that it's that same element that made him such an amazing villain. It added a level of mystery to what he was. The same goes for Venom. I don't believe Venom could pull off an entire movie as the main villain. Just because it works in the comics doesn't mean it would work on screen, and we have several unfortunate examples of this in other comic-book adaptations. Sam Raimi was brilliant in knowing Venom's part in the story and knowing to give him just enough time in the film to knock you off your seat and provide the elements the story required. It was brilliant.The downside to all of this? The action. Let's face it, people cry and cry for more story in their blockbusters but what they really want is flashy action, and the downside to having this wonderful, fleshed-out story is that the action sequences in it are shorter. In Spidey 2 there were pretty much 3 serious action scenes in the entire movie, and they were long and brilliant. In this one there are more but they're over just when you get sucked into them. In that respect the previous film was better. But, like the title suggests, this movie is the best one where it counts. You might need to watch the movie twice before you can really appreciate the action (as I plan to do), but as far as everything else goes, it's just perfect and you will not want to miss seeing it on the big screen.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Tobey Maguire is okay in the main role however he looks silly when asked to turn on the attitude once the Venom suit gets a hold of him. Kirsten Dunst isn't as endearing either and the whole love triangle fiasco is a calamity.All this drags down what should have been the crowning glory of an entertaining series so far.

That's fine and dandy, but something simply went wrong with this new spin on Spidey's web ...The movie seemed too loose. There was really never enough time to learn more about the characters. So, it's not that there were ""too many story lines,"" there was just not enough time to develop them.The worst aspect of the film is that I feel cheated. The fight between Spider-Man and Venom was far too short. Plus, Venom is an awesome villain and one of Spider-Man's most dangerous adversaries, where an entire film could be spent on him. Why waste an entire character like they did? Again, Venom should have been the main villain in this movie, or they should have saved him for the next one. Too much at once, which would not be a problem if the film satisfied the task. Overall the film is really average in my opinion. At least $250 million dollars went into making this film. Why?

I have never been a massive fan of the films but loved the comics and wanted to see Venom on the big screen sadly I should have waited for the film to rent the film.The 3rd movie can be tricky in a series: X men 3 was in too much of a rush to finish, Batman Forever too light weight but sometimes they can be good with the last crusade being better than temple of doom and giving raiders a run for its money. But sadly this film is too cramped with villains and pointless characters and too many ideas for it's still too long running time to cope.The Sandman with his back story linking him to Peter and powers, Venom with his powers and menace could have both had their own Spiderman film to fully explore their characters. Alas they are forced into this film which still focuses on the Green Goblin now Harry. As a result none of the villains are developed enough with Venom suffering most. In the comics he was a complex villain: Eddie Brock is what Peter might have been yet in this he just a bog standard villain. He may look cool but shows little of what made him such a popular character in the first place. This is probably due to his little screen time.Thomas Hayden Church struggles to play Sandman's motivation in this film which calls for him to be a villain one minute and a misunderstood hero the next. His effects at times brilliant at other times they felt like footage from the Mummy.Sam Raimi after cutting loose his bag of camera tricks in the 2nd film plays it safe here. One or two style moments but most of the time it is standard. Until an action scene comes along and the camera spins around in such a way that you cannot make head or tails of what is going one.I have always liked the casting of Tobey Maguire as Peter and he once again carries the movie with a good performance. His rage over Uncle Ben's killer is particularly well done. The trouble is his fall from grace by the symbiote is played too tongue in cheek by Raimi never really emotionally engaging the audience. James Franco's complex and charismatic turn makes Harry into Spidey's most interesting villain in the film. Kirsten Dunst struggles with the script that does no favours for Mary Jane. It starts well but then the plot asks her too lose her fire and spark making her once again scream for her life.As for the rest of the characters in many cases it is the same problem with too much going on meaning some are wasted. Bryce Dallas Howard's Gwen Stacy is hot adds nothing more than eye candy for the movie. Bruce Campbell and J. K. Simmons steal all their scenes while James Cromwell is wasted as Gwen's father getting nothing to do.In the end Spiderman has its moments but should have gone with less is more way of movie-making.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

And Kirsten Dunst singing? C'mon, did NOT need that. Plus the entire middle of the movie with Peter supposedly becoming ""evil"". Evil? If you call emo piano playing swing dancing badasses evil, then sure. And I'm sorry but I couldn't help but laugh after seeing Topher Grace with fangs.

The third film in both series takes an entirely different approach towards entertainment than the first two did. Rather than sticking to the proved formula that made both Spider-Man 1 and 2 such well-critiqued superhero movies, Sam Raimi has turned Spider-Man 3 into a movie that has no idea what it wants to be.It tries too hard to be melodramatic, with some of the most clichéd, expected, and cringingly bad dialogue I've ever heard in a movie. The first two Spidey films had a few moments like this, but the third in the series is almost full non-stop with these scenes that make you want to change the channel and find something better on.When the movie isn't being too melodramatic, however, it's trying to be freakishly campy. The first two films managed to include quite a bit of camp without completely suspending reality, but Spidey 3 takes the small amount of camp from the first two films and extends it to what felt like at least 30 minutes of material that I'll refer to as ""puke"". If any of you remember the ""raindrops keep fallin' on my head"" semi-music-video scene from Spider-Man 2, be prepared to see no less than two scenes that are even worse.There is, literally, a dance number during the movie, which is a great example of how the filmmakers seem to have completely forgotten what kind of movie they were trying to make. Because despite having a horribly unfitting and annoying dance, the scene suddenly ends with another of those disgusting melodramatic dialogue sequences.What Raimi did with this film is he tried to do too many things with it. The storyline itself wasn't the problem, however, and despite having so many side story lines and such, the film actually does a surprisingly good job of connecting and resolving them all. However, Raimi seems to have felt the need to add numerous unnecessary scenes and bits of dialogue throughout the film that really drag it down.To be honest, unlike the case for most action-type movies, I was constantly waiting for the action sequences. I just wanted the melodrama and the dance scenes to end so that the movie could get to the decisive moments and close. I've never left a theatre during a movie, but this was the first case in which I considered it.The movie has one saving grace: Bruce Campbell's much-expected cameo. It was one of the few moments during the movie that was truly entertaining, and I can only hope that once this movie starts playing on network TV, I'll remember to make sure and see that brief scene again before finding something better to watch.Ultimately, I feel that Raimi's biggest mistake with this movie is that he tried to make it into something different. As a sequel to two surprisingly good movies, one would hope to see a movie that is similar to those two in terms of action, comedy, and drama. But Raimi tried to do something very different with this one, and unfortunately, it's completely ruined the series for me.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I will give it a 10, simply for the deep messages it has, at least when you consider the age group at which this movie is directed to, which is mainly teenagers, and old fans that read the comics when the spider came out.I think it has a bit of everything and it looks at things in a very psychological way. It starts out with both being celebrities, not knowing themselves, and it undergoes a series of transformations that couldn't have been handled differently for the final purpose of the movie. Grief is what unites people is only one of the many messages of the movie, the others being learning to be humble and respectful and all the connotations with it. I remember reading a book a couple of years ago about WWII, and why the world ended up being what it is now. The main idea was that the tremendous life loss, atrocities without equal in the history of mankind, prompted people to stick together, love each other, and the force of love after grief had to be so great, that now you see the French and the German standing together for the same beliefs, otherwise we would have been doomed to a sort of eternal recurrence of wars and revenges. The power of forgiveness ties in to this as well, and this becomes obvious with Peter Parker and the Goblin as well as the other main characters in the movie.I think the only bad thing about this movie is that it's actually too short for the things that is trying to convey. It should have been a two part movie.In any case I loved it, and I'll give it a 10, and this comes from someone who loved and understood movies like Fight Club, Jacob's Ladder or Revolver who are very underrated precisely because their messages are hidden in layers of understanding and people have a hard time untangling the ideas. Here however they're much more obvious but a little rushed in and not fully developed, but like I said for the audience it targets, its a great movie, and for us who are past or a little past our teen years, I would still say a great enjoyable movie for any occasion.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Overall, a noticeable step back from the previous films as Sam Raimi tries to do much at once, but the film is still enjoyable with how campy and memey it is (like Bully Maguire).Direction: Decent
The direction on a macroscale is good as these are the highest budgeted action sequences, but it was very obvious this was a 3D movie (and it hasn't aged well); the direction on a microscale is a step back from the previous movie as the actors do not feel elevated, and the deeper concepts get muddled with the rest of the plot; the storytelling is a mess as the movie tries to tell so much in so little time; he builds tension well (but a step back from the previous movie as you know what is coming)Story: Bad
The plot is not that great because it introduces too many characters, it has 3 villains and a new love interest, and only increases the runtime by 10 minutes, so the structure is just mismanaged and breezes through plot points; the character writing is a step back because it introduces too many characters and does not provide any depth to themScreenplay: Decent
The dialogue is corny again as it is filled with many memeable lines (which also does make this movie iconic); the humor is unintentionally funny again because the movie reverted to being campy (enter Bully Maguire); the symbolism is there because the movie does tackle deep themes like arrogance, selfishness, and love, but not on a deeper level like the previous movie; the foreshadowing is pretty goodActing: Decent to Pretty Good
Tobey Maguire: Pretty Good (A step back from the previous movie as he goes back to being campy/memey since he can really only show arrogance and anger (Bully Maguire); his performance is still memorable because he still has an aura that represents what the Sam Raimi trilogy is)
Kirsten Dunst: Good (The only improvement from the last film as she is given more to work with MJ's increased depth)
James Franco: Pretty Good (Shows that he is a good actor, but he is given nothing to work with because Harry is nerfed and forced in this movie)
Thomas Haden Church: Pretty Bad (A very monotonous performance, but he does show emotion when talking about his backstory)
Topher Grace: Pretty Bad (Such a fun, over-the-top performance that emulates what this movie is; he is not a good Venom)
Bryce Dallas Howard: Decent (Kinda forced into this movie and does not really have chemistry with Maguire)
James Cromwell: Decent (Isn't really given much to work with)
Rosemary Harris: Good (Still plays the motherly figure well and carries the interpersonal scenes with Maguire)
J. K. Simmons: Very Good (Still shines in his scenes, but his screentime is shorter and he isn't given as much to work with)
Bruce Campbell: Good (Appreciate he was given an actual role in this movie as his comedic relief makes the scene he is in)
Rest of the cast: Decent (The performances as pretty campy, but they support the main cast)Score: Good to Very Good
A step back from the previous films but still incorporates very good themes throughout the movieSoundtrack: Pretty Good
Bully Maguire songCinematography: Decent
The movie is shot well, but the forced 3D shots have not aged wellEditing: GoodSound: Very Good
Feel polished and help bring to life the comic book charactersVisual Effects: Very Good
Some of the CGI are tacky as they tried to do forced 3D, but it is still leading for the timeProduction Design: Pretty Good
Feels more like New York rather than 'Spider-Man's New York'Makeup: Good
Helps show the scars and deformities in the charactersCostumes: Incredible
The Spider-Man and Black Spider-Man suits are incredibly iconic and the best in the franchisePacing
Pacing was incredibly fast as they breeze through so many plot points (If they cut out one of the villains and added depth in the scenes it would help slow the pace down)Climax
Climax is executed well but there is so much happening at onceTone
Tone is back to being campy and comic-book esqueFinal Notes
This movie is very enjoyable for how memey it is.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was not disappointed by the latest sequel, but I was not surprised by anything either. The special effects were just that, special. Amazing graphics were on display when any of the characters went into action. However, with the possible exception of the formation of the Sandman, unfortunately the movie did not create anything new with the graphics. The same intense web-slinging as the first two movies was here as well, but no sequence that was truly memorable. The acting was much improved from Spiderman 1 and 2. Especially from Dunst. She almost ruined the first Spideys for me, but actually did a decent job in this flick. Franco also greatly improved his performance the third time around (enter catchy ""third time's a charm for Franco"" line here). Bryce Dallas Howard is a remarkable actress casted in an unremarkable role. Howard has stunning beauty, but she just is not the ""hot chick"" Gwen Stacy is supposed to be. For that role, they could have picked up any of the dozens of incredibly random amazingly hot chicks throughout the movie. Try to count them all if you can. The casting of Topher Grace for Venom just was not right. The plot had glimpses of greatness (just the mention of Venom makes it a possibly great movie), but ultimately fell short. Too many villains, not enough time. Harry Osborn was the best villain, which is very sad when you consider the fact Venom was part of this movie. My biggest disappointment with this movie was the flow of the plot. While the plot was not obviously jaded, it did not completely come together as one story either. This is most likely the result of too many villains. Another letdown were the inconsistencies in the movie. There were too many unrealistic events that made me sit there and say to myself, ""That would not happen"" (and that is taking into account and accepting the comic book storyline).There was way too much crying in this movie, and sometimes at very inappropriate times. Humor took more of a front seat in 3 than it did in 1 and 2, and was well placed throughout the movie. Overall, it was a movie worth going to, and probably one I will see again with a different set of friends, but I did not appreciate it as much as the first two.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Obviously, I went to see the movie with great expectations. I had some reservations as to how they were going to fit so many characters in the movie, and sadly my fears were not baseless.At no point does the movie catch a tempo and maintain it. Its one hour too long and there are too many characters. Too many friends and too many foes!! Not to account for the multiple personalities Spidey goes through himself! There are really long periods of the film where absolutely nothing is happening...just some sappy love triangle brewing. And whats the deal with Uncle Ben. The guy's dead for crying out loud. Is there no other interesting angle in Spidey's life?!! All in all the movie is average. Terribly disappointing for fans especially after Spiderman-2. My advice is, if you have to watch the movie, don't have any expectations. 90 minutes into the movie you could take a restroom break, hell you could take a shower and come and you wouldn't miss anything. Best of luck!","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The action was high quality, and the stories stellar. The first two are perfect comic book movies. Spiderman (2002) had the best story of any superhero film, and Spiderman 2 (2004) had the best use of license and action of any superhero film. Both had consistently good acting and production qualities.The good news is that some of the qualities of the first two carry over. There is still great direction and production qualities. The acting is still great, because the fine dialog is still in the movie.The bad news is... everywhere. The story isn't that good. It's really the most flawed part of the movie. They try to fit so much into one film. Three villains headline the movie: New Goblin, Sandman, and Venom. At first I thought the film felt rushed with three villains, but this proved to be a bias I shouldn't have. Though it was a bit rushed, the villains and their battles flowed pretty easily. Sandman was well-developed, but Venom was entirely too rushed. The development of Venom worked well, but once Eddie Brock became Venom, he was ready to kill Spiderman. We were propelled directly into the climatic fight. It should be noted that Sandman's creation is a bit cheesy, and unrealistic. For a Spiderman movie...A lot of comic book material was handled poorly. Eddie Brock was horribly cast. Venom shouldn't be laughable. He should be frightening and menacing. They failed to capture the true heart of the character. Sandman was well-done, minus his before-mentioned far-fetched creation. He seems to be ripped straight out of the comics. The best part of the movie was seeing the New Goblin. We've been waiting for the moment the entire trilogy, the moment two friends must fight because of ignorance. It's handled well. But since the fight between the two happens in the first ten minutes, it feels a bit rushed. You'll also feel copped-out; Harry gets amnesia and forgets his bane with Peter. It seems redeemed, though, because all of Harry's screen time is used regaining his knowledge, eventually following back in love with MJ and gaining his hatred of his past and Peter.The action of Spiderman 2 is a hard act to follow. Part three falls short, but that doesn't mean it sucks. Sandman throws an interesting dynamic into the fight scenes. His sand powers are an advantage and disadvantage. It's up to the protagonists- yes, it's plural- to harness the sand to their advantage. Ultimately, Sandman may be more powerful than Doc Ock of Part 2, but he's not as smart, and thus the fights aren't as smart or thrilling. It's more about brute force, here. New Goblin is essentially the Green Goblin, except a more maneuverable glider, some cooler gadgets, and New Goblin is in better shape. The Venom sequence is a perfect emulation of a Stan Lee-quality comic. Venom is a menace. Even if you're not satisfied by his build-up, you will be happy with the fight. And of course, many punches are thrown in free fall. Thank you, Sam Raimi.From previous performers, expect more of the same in acting. Both the good and the bad. Topher Grace is awful. Though the part is written well, he plays the role comically. It's just not Eddie Brock. And he's not menacing both in voice and physical features. Howard is a nice Gwen Staci. She is very girly and very in tune with the character. Cromwell is also an all right Chief-of-Police. But not stellar. I have no complaints about Church's performance as Sandman. He is surprisingly as bitter as he should have been.There's some scenes played solely for laughs. This annoyed me, because the story should have been the darkest of the series. It's all about revenge! Oh, and there's one scene I simply wish didn't exist. Peter, entranced by the Venom symbiote, goes to a jazz club with his new girlfriend. A crazy dance scene results. The scene is there to express how the symbiote has changed him, but it simply wasn't the right way to show the symbiote had a negative affect on Peter.Overall, I give this film a B-.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I have highly anticipated the release of Spiderman 3 since the end of Spiderman 2 and it pains me greatly to express my feelings here about it. I respect Sam Raimi and his directing ability, especially his character development. His movies ARE entertaining. I want to make that clear because my Spiderman 3 review is not a positive review.This movie has many problems. The first and most important problem is the lack of character development. Sam Raimi put a lot of time and effort in the first 2 films to make sure we knew and empathized with the characters. It takes a lot of talent to make us sympathize with a Villain to the point that we almost hate to see them go at the end. That's good movie making. Spiderman 3 just didn't have those qualities. Not only did it lack insight into getting to know the NEW characters, it also made the ones we have grown to love in the last 2 movies seem like we didn't know them at all. They just didn't behave like the same characters.And that's even BEFORE the oozie goop took hold of Peter. As far as the NEW cast, the only new character we got ANY background at all about was Sandman. He has an unhappy wife and a daughter dying of a terrible sickness. We are supposed to understand here that it's his daughter's sickness that motivates him to rob banks and NOT the fact that he's a bad guy. But yet, he smashed police cars and armored trucks like it's a day at the office. Yeah, maybe no one got hurt because it was a PG movie but flying police cars DO injure and sometimes kill people in the real world. :) Then after the destruction of a city block, he'd turn to spidey and say ""I don't want to hurt you."" or ""I'm not a bad guy."" Did anyone get the feeling he seemed to be a bit wishy washy? It seemed like the screenwriters (or Sam) couldn't decide WHAT kind of person they wanted Sandman to be. And then of course there's Eddie Brock and Venom. Where do I start? I'll try to give Sam the benefit of the doubt here because he has stated that he doesn't like Venom. With that in mind, I'm sure his heart just wasn't in it. That probably began the demise of Eddie from the first scene with him in it. He just comes across as a womanizing jerk that likes to take pictures and doesn't mind faking them. And, that's pretty much all we get. Where did he come from? Did he have family? And the biggest question. WAS he REALLY dating Gwen Stacy? Although he tells Capt Stacy he is, other than the ONE conversation between Gwen and Brock in which she pretty much blew him off, there's nothing to support that. The film never says for sure. I'm guessing they weren't. So, this makes it EVER so strange that he'd be in a church praying for the death of Peter Parker over something he didn't really loose. Based on what we saw...I just didn't see anything happening to Brock that was terrible enough to be praying for God's help in ending someone's life. It was only a job that he JUST got the day before. How bad could it be? Not to mention he DID fake photos. How's that REALLY Pete's fault? Anyway, back to Sam. I understand that even though he didn't really want to do Venom, he wanted to give the screaming fans (me included) something. So,we got 15 minutes of a barely seen, barely speaking, undeveloped character that seemed to have no believable motivation for hating Peter. And this was pretty much just so we Venomites would close our traps about it. I might have wanted to see Venom, but not so much that I wanted to sacrifice story and character development for it. Not to mention Venom should be one of those ""entire movie"" Villains like GG and Doc Ock. They got a whole movie and Venom got 15 minutes? Again, Sam doesn't like Venom, I guess I can understand and forgive his lack of dedication to the character. But, can we forgive the Gwen Stacy oops? A major character in the world of Spiderman. At least in the comics. But, in this movie she was reduced to being nothing more than a character contrived to make Mary Jane jealous? Are you kidding? That would almost be like making the Black Cat a waitress in the French restaurant where Peter was going to propose to MJ. A very wasted character. The obvious problem with this movie is that it just has WAY to much going on to take time for that character development stuff. So, we end up with a detached story and empty faceless characters without a real purpose. Even the romance between Peter and MJ seemed awkward. It didn't flow as well as it did in the previous films. It almost seemed like Sam was TRYING to force some romance into a plot packed movie in between all the action scenes. I wouldn't say I left the theater thinking it was a bad movie, it was just very disheartening. This will in no way affect my future viewing of other Sam Raimi movies...but let me just say this to Sam. Sam, in the future, if you're not committed to a character or idea, don't do it. Only stick with the ones you have a passion for. I miss the old Spidey cast and it's magic.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Likewise, Peter's former best friend ""Harry Osborn"" (James Franco) is also aware of this fact but--under the erroneous assumption that Spider-Man killed his father--has subsequently immersed himself in his father's technology to become the Green Goblin in order to seek vengeance upon him. Meanwhile, two new villains emerge with one being an escaped convict by the name of ""Flint Marko"" (Thomas Haden Church) who, because of an accident involving a state-of-the-art technological project involving sand, is transformed into a super criminal known as the Sandman. And to make matters even worse, an alien lifeform has attached itself to Peter and, after assuming Spider-Man's powers, invades the body of a bitter rival by the name of ""Eddie Brock"" (Topher Grace) and now becomes an evil clone known as Venom. Not only that, but to complicate things even more, an attractive woman named ""Gwen Stacy"" (Bryce Dallas Howard) enters Spider-Man's life which undermines Mary Jane's feelings for Peter as well. Now, rather than reveal any more, let me I just say that I liked all of the new characters added for this particular sequel. They were all outstanding--with Venom being especially noteworthy. The problem, however, is that there were too many characters for this one film to fully integrate without everything seeming too crowded. And the director (Sam Raimi) should have known this. But that's Hollywood for you. Having said that, and in spite of this rather obvious flaw, I still enjoyed this film for the most part, and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The other message; allowing one's dark side to take over and all the consequences, is very obvious; like StarWars, there are consequences or choosing a wrong path. Unlike the former installments, which used there time more effectively and told poignant stories. This installment is a bit too long winded and borders on preachy. But who cares, it's Spiderman and the special effects are great! There are also some memorable scenes between Mary and Peter and between Harry and Peter and even the Sandman. Forgiveness is the key that moves one from a dark past, into a brighter future.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I loved the first two films i love the 90s cartoon series with a passion. the trailers looked great and i was happy that it was 2hrs 30 mins long, until i started watching. I like a long film but when it drags on this much i was just getting bored and annoyed.The best thing about this film was the CGI, it was pretty amazing especially the transformation of sandman. But the fight scenes were very fast (couldn't hardly see what was happening in the first battle) followed by very very slow story telling. Some of the dialogue and acting was horrible in places and just OK for the rest of the film. An emotional scene on the bridge where peter starts crying was laughable (as can be heard from the hundreds laughing in the cinema) The news reporter at the end was horrible, pretty much most of the story telling was just laughable. You could tell people in the cinema weren't happy with this film.There were points in this film where i couldn't take it any more and was thinking of walking out, and where the hell had his spidey sense gone, he was useless.I even went to see it again the next day to get another view on it and i was even more bored. Not a lot happens in the 2 1/2 hours and i left feeling very disappointed. The only reason im giving it a six is because its spiderman and the effects were brilliant, everything else below average.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Two bad guys on the loose including a dude who's filling in the shoes of the Green Goblin from the first movie, and an escaped convict who appears to be another trouble maker for Spider-Man. Not to mention the encounter with a black substance that seems to be an improvement for Spider-Man's powers but may also be the key to one of his other problems. That includes his decision on his daily life, career, girlfriend, and his future as Spider Man.It has action, it has amazing special effects, and everything that was included from the previous two movies. As well as covering up some unanswered situations that were left unsolved in the previous installments.The problem is I can't except this third installment to be any better than the first two. Which I already posted my comments on(check my reviews on Spider Man 1 & 2 for more info). Again I'm not obsess with the entire Spider Man universe. Which is one of the many reasons why this movie didn't meet my demands on what a second sequel should be like. Nothing really made me like it more than the first two. Probably because it still has too many out of situation scenes that just made my eyes rolled. As in obvious and ""what is he thinking?"" type of scenes. It just made me feel like I was watching Spider Man 1 or 2 again.If the script was improved in a feel parts of it. Then I might accept it's brilliants. But in the end the whole Spider Man Trilogy isn't worthy of being own on DVD.Not to offend the fans in anyway possible. I'm only giving my 5 cents of thought on the movie in general. I have nothing against the whole Spider Man series. It's just the live action movies could of been better made.To come to an end, I only recommend this to any die-hard fan of the series or the Spider Man Movies in general. For those who read much more negative reviews than mine. Then rent it or borrow it in case you're not sure if it's worth owning on DVD.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Listen, Spiderman is Stan Lee's classic, its a staple of American pop culture, but I think that people attend cinemas with academy award winning performances and immaculate directing. Sheer entertainment and sometimes nostalgia what can be gained from a film like Spiderman. I think that the corny sob story of the sandman added some comic book flare, explaining how no one is truly a ""bad"" guy. Venom was crept into the storyline with flare and finesse, and Toby Mcguire, who has become the face of spider-man did just as well as he did in the first two spidey flicks. The Special effects were great, awesome action scenes, perfect amount of drama, humor, and violence. This film was a sheer entertainer. I'm shocked to see that people liked Ghost Rider better than Spider Man 3. Ghost Rider was just a horrible uninteresting film, whereas spidey-3 still keeps you engaged and want to stay till the end.

Thomas Hayden Church has a few great scenes as the Sandman, but he disappears for huge chunks of the film, and his storyline never quite comes together. Bryce Dallas Howard has even less to do as Gwen Stacey, and James Cromwell, playing her dad, barely features at all. And Venom - the most famous Spider-Man villain of the 1980s and 1990s - has what amounts to a glorified cameo.Why on earth is this film so overstuffed, so overwrought, so sloppy? Who thought it was a good idea to include three villains? And who actually believed that the tedious soap opera scenes between Mary Jane and Peter worked? I'm sad to say that they produced groans and derisory laughter in my local theater.The worst problem with the film is that Spidey isn't even properly characterized. I've been sort of a Spider-Man fan for twenty years now, and I understand the character. He is supposed to be *funny* - witty, sarcastic, charming. Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man is none of these things. He's just a depressed, charmless drag. A total social misfit. He's nowhere near charismatic enough to be Spider-Man, as I envision the character.So, saddled with a drippy Spidey and a messed-up plot, this movie can only be so good. Even the much-vaunted special effects aren't so great; they look like a super-advanced computer game or cartoon. Frankly, I'm sick of CGI, and I'm ready for a new special effects revolution. I want more real stunts and more ""physical"" special effects in my blockbusters. For goodness' sake, I actually think the action scenes from 1950s war movies eclipse Spider-Man 3 in the excitement stakes, and that's bad! I also had major problems with two important plot points. Point one: the symbiote is never properly explained. Point two: some random butler character comes out of nowhere and resolves the most important conflict in the film. Good grief, why?Despite having all these flaws, Spider-Man 3 delivered about two stars' worth of entertainment for me; I give credit to James Franco, who rises above the material and gives a likable performance. But I still think this movie might kill the now uber-expensive Spidey franchise, or at least blunt public enthusiasm. Audience members in my theater seemed disappointed and lacking in energy. And who can blame them?","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I have reading some of the reviews here and , for Christ sake, they are bad reviews!!! They seem to highly underrate this movie. By most of the people (responsible for a 6 rating!!!) these are the flaws of the film:-too many villains -crossing plots and subplots -cheesy humour(peter dancing) -too much Mary Jane and Peter Parker screen time -too less of Venom screen time/not the Venom we know from the comic books -worse music than the precedent installment -bad acting of Tobey and Kirstenand bla bla bla.Now, folks, let's all calm down for a moment.I will take the points you have criticized one by one:-too many villains: excuse me, have you seen X-men movies? The Magneto gang is always composed of at least 3 villains. The movie should have been 3 hours long to please everyone. You can't expect Sam Raimi to direct an all pleasing movie like The Golden Compass did and was weak because of that. He had chosen to develop interesting villains such as Green Goblin Jr. and Sandman. As for Venom, which I am a big fan, it's because of the fans that it was introduced and because Avi Arad sad so... Maybe a movie on Venom only deserves to be made, not a pointless reboot... -crossing plots and subplots: for me it was a delight to see how Sam Raimi, which like playing with the audience and the actors, made a theatrical take on the conflicts. It is very refreshing and very rare these days to have a rich non linear script. Thanks to that, it was not predictable which is a good thing. All the actors were respected with a certain amount of screen time.-cheesy humor(ex: peter dancing): give him a break! It was funnier than grotesque and many movies(comedies) can't even compare with the humorous tone of Spider-man 3! It was good comedy, perfect for Spider-man saga.-too much Mary Jane and Peter Parker screen time: sorry, again but they are the most important characters in the movie!-too less of Venom screen time/not the Venom we know from the comic books: Venom was forced as a character in this movie, so don't blame Raimi for giving him little screen time. On the other side, indeed Venom should have been bigger in scale; saying that, Topher Grace did a perfect job in a movie that is made for a large audience: so, no gore or no ""traumatizing"" presence as in Comic books.-worse music than the precedent installment: only with the black suit theme( Danny Elfman should never have left Spider-man 3...)-bad acting of Tobey and Kirsten: it's like saying bad acting for Leonardo and Cate on Titanic: characters played by the perfectly matched actors.Now, the good things:I think the movie is marvelous, as a real Marvel film should be ;). It is the biggest and the most underrated super hero movie I know (but again, here Chronicles of Riddick gets only 6, where as it's one of the best sci-fi opera movies).This movie stands on its own and is a darker, more complex, funnier and more action packed than the previous ones. Also, complex story means ""not pleasing everyone"". Let's not forget it's a comic book movie, so the 100 % logic approach don't do justice to it nor to it's magic.Not have been nominated nor awarded with the Special effects Oscar is a real slap in the face to the SFX crew which worked on this movie.The Sandman birth scene: the best and ""poetical"" special effects I have seen on a CGI character to date. I watched Avatar this year and it is still true. The action and the mix with drama and humor make this movie an outstanding movie. the casting, the sets and the pacing were very good. The fights in the air were well choreographed, though I would have preferred a smoother take in the first Peter Parker fight (the same stunt coordinator from Jason Born Ultimatum, so...) All the underrating is caused by the fact that some people take movies too seriously and seek a master piece in everything. It is a movie to enjoy, not to analyze. Go and see Elektra, Daredevil and Punisher if you think it's better! The ""citezenkane review attitude"" (CRA ;) is a very common thing here.You still believe Iron-Man is better? Well: not the second, because it lacked action, and let's face it, it is one of the main attraction in the Super-hero movies.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

After 2 stellar movie classics, Raimi and Co. fumbled this one. Maybe something happened in the editing room, maybe the cast and director are burnt out on Spider-Man, who knows.This is a tough one to write, because ""Spider-Man 3"" is definitely not blatant crap (""Batman & Robin"") or ill-conceived creativity (""Hulk""). It is actually, often, a very rousing and entertaining movie. You can see where the filmmakers decided to give Peter a new lesson to learn, and had the conflicts with the THREE (!!!) super villains reflect that lesson. Very smart, and a lot better than you get with other films in this genre.HOWEVER . . . there is so much going on here, so many plot lines elbowing for space, that it is just a convoluted jumble. I couldn't tell you the main, most important plot line if I tried; they are all that equally measured. I can tell you, however, that the plot line involving Peter and Mary Jane's relationship, and the one involving Peter's own inner struggle with his dark side, are given enough exposition that the other plot lines involving the Sandman, Venom and the junior Goblin - you know, the villains, the antagonists, the guys who traditionally give a story like this its dramatic tension - sadly get shortchanged.Finally, they commit a cardinal sin in movies: A character (or characters) standing and explaining something to another. I will not give spoilers, but at least twice in this movie, a character explains either their motivation or a crucial bit of information, which then helps get us to the next scene. In movies explanation is a sin because movies are a visual medium. Discovering a character's motivation, or a crucial bit of information, is typically done non-verbally. Their behavior / actions tell us the story, which is kind of the point of motion pictures. I am shocked and, again, disappointed that a master like Sam Raimi let this happen more than once in his movie.Hey, go see the movie, it won't bore you. You'll probably even like it. But sadly this third chapter does not join its predecessors on the DVD shelf of classic genre cinema. What a shame.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I assumed that scenes in the Daily Bugle's main office would make me chuckle. I assumed that Spider-man 3 would improve on its predecessor the way Spider-man 2 improved on the original. My first two assumptions were correct. The last was wrong.The biggest flaw this movie has - and believe me, it's unignorably huge - is the melodrama. I'm all for drama. I'm all for romance. If you want to infuse these elements into a summer blockbuster superhero comic book flick, by all means, please do. It'd be a nice change of pace. To be nice, I'll say that I've seen less melodrama in certain soap operas than I saw today in Spider-man 3. Some parts were downright laughable. The quivering lips, for example. I thought that Tobey Maguire's lips and Kirsten Dunst's lips were turning into caterpillars, were, in fact, going to crawl straight off their faces.There are also a few parts that just don't make sense. To avoid spoiling the movie for anybody (as if it needs any help), I'll say that a particular character is present while an explosion with flames at LEAST fifteen from the blast point goes off less than a foot from said character's head. The character survives. About a third of his face has some mild scarring.The character development is top-notch for our tarantulan hero, as well as for Mary Jane and Harry. The two villains introduced here must split their screen time and so get less development. I didn't really understand Venom's plight, but was forced to accept it anyway. If he were a real human being (and I accept that he's not), he would have seen that HE was the one in the wrong and moved on with life.The special effects are great for the most part. The sandman, on the small scale, is nothing short of amazing. As an eight-foot-tall monster, he reminds me of The Mummy Returns, with The Rock's face and body wrapped about a digital scorpion.The end result is a $250 million movie that would probably have been better suited for a straight-to-DVD release. Don't waste your time seeing this in theaters unless you'll enjoy watching a superhero version of Titanic - poor, flat acting; mostly good eye candy; bad pacing; and a truly laughable attempt at tugging at the audience's heartstrings.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

"6","/10","An enjoyable film, but not without flaws","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1653476/?ref_=tt_urv","nyskins1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3634340/?ref_=tt_urv","10 May 2007","What made the first two Spider-Man movies so enjoyable was the extent to which they stuck to the overall feeling of the comic books--the schmaltz, the fun action, and the somewhat cheesy dialogue. And while Spider-Man 3 is enjoyable as well, where it ultimately fails is in trying too hard to capture that essence--and in trying to do too much.The beginning of the film finds Peter in a rather good place. The city loves him, things are going great with Mary Jane, and he's doing well in his physics class. But things go south rather quickly when Mary Jane starts to feel under-accomplished next to him; Harry decides to go on a murderous revenge streak; there's a new photographer at the Bugle named Eddie Brock; and, to top it all off, the guy he killed in the first movie didn't actually kill his uncle. Have I lost you yet?That's not to say, however, that Spider-Man 3 feels cluttered. It just feels underdeveloped. In the previous two movies we had villains who had interesting backgrounds with lots of exposition. Here, the villains are kind of left to the wayside. All that matters is that they exist. Which is a shame, considering how well-cast both parts were.Continuing the tradition of the previous two Spidey flicks, this movie is beautifully cast. In the first film, we had Willem Dafoe playing essentially two parts. In the second movie. Alfred Molina captured the quiet genius and complex menace of Doc Ock. In this movie, we have Topher Grace, who does surprisingly well as the brash, arrogant Eddie Brock. And Thomas Haden Church takes what little exposition is given him and creates a truly multi-layered villain. Then there's Bryce Dallas Howard, who--while a bit underused--is a perfect Gwen Stacy.Enough cannot be said about the effects in this movie. It is easy to see where the money went. It is virtually impossible to tell when Spidey is CGI vs. real (ignoring, of course, the impossibility of some shots). Some of the camera-work is incredible; it is rare to see a director who can make some scenes that are disorienting yet still easy to follow.But where Spider-Man 3 ultimately falls short is in its trying to do too much. There's too much of the comic book cheese; too much story; even too much action, perhaps. But the film is still extremely enjoyable despite its flaws, and it is head and shoulders above some of the travesties put out by Marvel in recent years (Fantastic Four, Daredevil, The Hulk). Do yourself a favor and see this movie for what it is--an enjoyable conclusion to a well-done trilogy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There are one too many villains (Venom, Sandman, and sometimes Harry), the story is a bit convoluted, but so much as you don't know what's going on, it's just a bit much for a two-hour film. And something that makes it even more disappointing is that Sam Raimi had planned a Spider-Man 3 that was totally different and would've probably been really good.

Spider-Man comes to tangle with yet another enemy, in a tale that is yet much the same as the others.In the first part of the film I was slightly irritated by the characters and the way they got completely pulled out of context by the ridiculous way they were played. Then I more or less accepted that that was the shallow way the series was written in the first place and that's where it got slightly better. But only slightly. Next part was eye-candy. Special effects to the max, albeit bad special effects. For a film of this caliber and budget I was expecting much better. Then comes the continuation of the story and I can't say that was entirely appealing either. To be brutally honest, I found it an insult toward the comic series and an insult to the previous two films.All in all, it was a film I didn't expect much from, but one that still managed to give me even less.

The storyline with the symbiote in its original comics form was butchered to the point of absurdity. Maguire while excellent in the first two films as spiderman, could not pull off the transitions required by the symbiote. He to me seemed like little more than an arrogant emo high school kid. Kirsten Dunst as MJ, was totally flat and unbelievable. The chemistry that existed in the first two films between she and Tobey simply was not there. Thomas Haden Church, was good in his part, but the role of Sandman was also butchered from its comics origin. Sandman in the comics did not kill Ben Parker, why did they feel the need to do such with the film, it added nothing to the flat storyline. Not to mention Sandamn in the comics was not the tragic villain simply searching for a cure for his kid, he was a petty thug, there was no tragedy or Shakespearean aura to his character. Now this brings me to Venom played woefully and tedious by Topher Grace, or as most of us will forever know him as Eric Foreman the skinny kid from that 70' show. Grace spent his whole on screen time trying to be comical and nonchalant, to me it just seemed like skinny kid with a symbiote. Raimi then proceeds to kill the Symbiote and Brock after a cheesy showdown with Spiderman. Indeed Brock is no longer Venom in the MArvel Universe, and is dying with Cancer, but the symbiote is never destroyed, it later Bonds with Mac Gargan better known as The Scorpion, becoming an even more powerful entity. JK Simmons as J Jonah Jameson was perfect in his part, but the role is not large enough to save the film. Out of the main cast, JAmes Franco as Harry Osborn gave the best performance. His transition from evil to good was done very well, and he was by far the character that you could honestly sympathize with and identify with. In short the performances overall were lousy, especially the villains, none of them really had any oomph or character like we experienced with Alfred Molina as Doc Ock. And none could even come close to Willem Dafoe's demonic and chillingly insane portrayal of Norman Osborn. If you were a fan of the first two films, this one certainly does not live up to expectations, it seems to being going the way of the original Batman movies.......ridiculous.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I went to spiderman 3 hoping it would be the best, and was a little disappointed. It is a good movie, and of all Spiderman movies it definitely has the best action. But as far as the story goes, I think Sam Raimi tried to do way too many things at one time. There's's the story of Harry and Pete's rivalry, Pete and Mary Jane's relationship troubles, the origin and motives of the Sandman, the story of the symbiote and spiderman, and then finally the story of Eddie Brock and Venom. It seems like it would have worked so much better as two separate movies, the sybiote and venom story alone is enough for a two hour movie. And since it kept jumping back and forth between characters and settings, it was hard to get into something because you were quickly knocked out of it shortly after. The acting and comedy is just as good as it's ever been, it's just the pacing that hurt the performances.

Having now seen the film it is apparent where the hate is coming from but these factors are not enough to detract from the overall enjoyment which can be derived from the film. The haters point to the over use of coincidence, poor character exploration (especially the villains), the weird portrayal of the bad Spidey and the use of certain scenes as mere vessels to further the plot at the expense of cohesion. The haters have a point. This film does not have the freshness and crisp execution of the first nor is it as good an overall film as the second.What this film has an abundance of is fun. The effects needless to say are impressive, the thrills and spills come thick and fast and the humour although less subtle than its predecessors make the film extremely entertaining. Despite Peter Parker being made a figure of fun, I believe the general audience will still have enough emotional investment in the character to care about what happens to him. You can make fun out of Spiderman in a way that would not work for Superman or Batman which why audiences world wide have a great affection for Peter Parker.

So many franchises (The Godfather series, the X-Men Series) have fizzled in their third act. It takes a talented cast and crew and a boatload of great material to create a ""part III"" that rises above the first tow, or at least matches it. It's not impossible (see the Star Wars series and the Mission Impossible series), but it's incredibly difficult. However, I had faith in my friendly neighborhood Spider-Man cast and crew. After all, how often does a sequel surpass the original film by leaps and bounds? Since the Spider-Man series practically invented the new concept of the popcorn-film-with-heart, I had no reason to believe that director Sam Raimi and his talented ensemble would fail me. After all, with Stan Lee's brilliant comic books, there was no way that this film could run out of material. Ironically enough, that's exactly what brings down 'Spider-Man 3"". This film suffers from the horrible ""more is better"" philosophy that I hoped and prayed was above Raimi and Co. Three villains! A new love interest! More action! More pointless web-swinging set to that ubiquitous Danny Elfman theme. More, more, more! But more is not better, as the audience quickly discovers. Sure, the cast is reliable, as usual (Bruce Campbell deserves special mention in a hysterical cameo). But what 'Spider-Man 3' lacks is the witty, wondrous script that carried the first two films. Raimi, a brilliant director, decides to try his hand at screen writing this time around, and boy, does he blow it. Villains are given huge, lengthy set-up scenes, and then pushed aside until they are needed for the balls-to-the wall finale. The love scenes feel bland and bloated. And the heart of the story-Peter's battle with his own dark desires-plays out more like Jim Carrey's 'The Mask' than a serious drama. Even the action scenes suffer under Raimi's pen-the finale, with Spidey trying to save MJ, who dangles precariously off the edge of a building in a taxicab, is blatantly ripped of from part 1's climactic battle. But the worst atrocity of this film is the dialogue. Sample line? ""I like being bad. It makes me happy."" 'Nuff said. If this summer of threequels continues in the vein of 'Spider Man 3', then it will be a very disappointing summer, indeed.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

So before I give my opinions on the latest installment of the Spider-Man series, titled Spider-Man 3, I will give a brief recap on what we have seen so far.First we had ""Spider-Man 1"", the great introduction to possibly the greatest superhero film series ever. Sam Raimi proceeds with excellent direction, Tobey McGuire plays the noble Peter Parker, his innocence and good heart highlighting the inner sentimentality of the film which is well supported by the just as sentimental characters of Uncle Ben and Aunt May. With a lot of web swinging fun and spectacular visual effects, as well as a great line of talented actors, including Kirsten Dunst as the beautifully helpless damsel in distress Mary Jane Watson, and William Dafoe as the crooked, evil-faced villain The Green Goblin, the Spider-Man franchise kicks off with one hell of start.Next came Spider-Man 2, the sequel, and a very good one at that. Here, we pick up from Peter Parker's last words of commitment ""With great power, comes great responsibility"", however his thoughts on the prospect of his deceased Uncle Ben are starting to lose meaning when his beloved Mary Jane is engaged to be married and the rest of his world as a superhero starts to crash down on him. With greater depth into the Spider-Man character, even better visual effects, and awesome one-on-one action sequences between the hero and the villain (the villain being Doc Oct, portrayed by Alfred Molina), the Spider-Man series continues to receive considerable acclaim both critically and publicly.Then we have Spider-Man 3, supposedly the second to last installment of the series. With more villains, more action, and whole lot more visual effects, you'd think that this would be the best of them all, well think again, because this is not the Spider-Man that you know and love.I don't know what the creators were thinking when they created this picture. Maybe they were just looking for an excuse to put in two of the greatest spider-man villains (Venon and Sandman), or perhaps they wanted to give the Spider-Man character a bit of a new, more compelling look. If that was the intention, then what a mistake it was.Don't get me wrong, there is some good stuff about this movie, take for example the visual effects. You can't deny that they are some of the most amazing you've seen come out of the Spider-Man franchise. I specifically enjoyed the birth of Sandman, where he slowly rises up from the sand that we was mixed with, that was one of the coolest things ever, but sadly it doesn't way out all the other flaws in this movie.I guess one of my main complaints about Spider-Man 3 is the script, it's way too complex. The good thing about the previous films was that they were simple and focused. You have the inner struggle, the villain, and the relationship with Mary Jane. It was perfect and easy to digest. Then we were given the third installment, where they completely overstocked on character as well as conflict-ions between character profile. It was exhausting and overwhelming, very hard to sit through. I mean seriously: 3 villains, Sandman's background, trouble with MJ, Harry's changing attitudes, 2 different Spider-mans, competition at the Bugle, Gwen Stacy. IT'S JUST TOO MUCH! I'm not going to drag this review out any further and pick on the little annoying things, so I'm just going to comment on my second biggest problem with this movie. The fact is that Tobey McGuire can not pull of the bad guy look. We see him only as the sweet, strong hearted young man who does more than everything to protect the one's that he loves. That's who he is, that's what he's best at, and when you make him out to be the cocky and ignorant alter ego a huge meltdown is unavoidable, no matter how much eye-strapping visual effects you try to stuff into it. Spider-Man 3 is not absolutely intolerable. It has it's moments of drama and entertaining action. But in my opinion, this doesn't stand the least bit of a fighting chance against the earlier installments. If there is going to be a fourth film, and I sincerely hope that there will be, and that Tobey McGuire is going to return to be Spider-Man again (because frankly I can't imagine anyone else playing the role), the one thing that the director has to keep in mind is that tarnishing the recognizing image is not going to do you any good what so ever.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

A terrific cast, a great director, and the biggest budget of any action movie I have ever seen. But still, despite all of this, the movie fell quite short.My biggest complaint was the plot. It was just way too chaotic. It seemed like Raimi had this idea for an epic movie with all these villains and new characters and would somehow manage to tie it up in a nice little package to leave the viewing audience satisfied with this supposed ending to the Spider-man franchise. But it didn't work. The only new character that was really given any depth was Thomas Hayden Church's Sandman. But sadly, it was all wasted. He should have been more of the focus of the film rather focusing on the build-up of Eddie Brock's transformation into Venom--who I think should not have even been in the movie at all. The whole movie just seemed really rushed despite its 2 hour and 20 minute run time. There was just way too much going on at once.But the film did have a few redeeming qualities. The humor was great. It wasn't too overdone and made the film really enjoyable. Especially Bruce Campbell's best cameo yet. I was in stitches.The action sequences were also quite a spectacle. Raimi has a great skill for handling these fast paced action scenes involving Spider-man and manage to make them chaotic enough to be exciting, but coherent enough to be able to know what is going on.If it weren't for these two redeeming aspects, I would have out right hated Spider-man 3. So I would say that it is best to skip this chapter. You'll save yourself headache.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Of course I have watched it before, so it was not exactly a new viewing experience.The storyline in ""Spider-Man 3"" is good. Writers Sam Raimi, Ivan Raimi and Alvin Sargent put together a script and storyline that definitely was almost fully up to par with the 2002 ""Spider-Man"" and the 2004 ""Spider-Man 2"" movies, so that was quite a nice thing, and a good accomplishment from the writers. If you enjoyed the previous two movies, you will also enjoy this third movie from director Sam Raimi.The movie does have some flaws, and the plot does suffer a bit from prolonged periods of stagnancy. Sure, it was a good story, but there were just parts where the plot seemed to be running in Neutral gear.And it was nice to see the cast from the previous two movies return to reprise their roles and characters, with that being Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Rosemary Harris and J. K. Simmons. The two villains in this third movie were portrayed by Thomas Haden Church and Topher Grace. And just like in the previous two movies, there was a nice appearance from Bruce Campbell himself.While were are on the topic of the two villains, then I have to say that I found the Sandman to be a filler character - pardon the pun. But his story arch and motivation was rather weak and he didn't really do much of anything than assaulting Spider-Man. Whereas Venom seemed a bit more interesting and fleshed out - pardon the pun again.Visually then ""Spider-Man 3"" is good, and it is quite a step up from the previous two movies. So thumbs up to the CGI and special effects department for that accomplishment. I will say that this movie is definitely the most visually impressive of the three Sam Raimi directed ""Spider-Man"" movies.I've enjoyed ""Spider-Man 3"" every time I've sat down to watch it, and that is a testament to the contents of the script and storyline, proving that the writers really were doing a great job.My rating of ""Spider-Man 3"" lands on a six out of ten stars.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The whole theater laughed whenever Tobey Maguire tried to do any emoting, many of the plot developments were completely inane, and frankly the action scenes weren't even that imaginative. As a friend of mine described the script, it was as if they had written it straight through in one sitting and done no editing - each line of dialog was trite and predictable.As others have pointed out, perhaps the most significant problem with this movie was that it tried to include too many story lines, with three villains, Spider-man's love woes, etc. While each of these villains might have been worthwhile if they had time to develop, each was left seeming like a simple vehicle for more action sequences. I tend to think that the problem was not that too many villains led to a bad movie so much as that the writers were too uninspired to really come up with enough plot and dialog to flesh out any one character, so they just added more.I know what you're thinking -- ""Oh, I'll love it anyways! I love super hero movies!"" -- No. Trust me. You won't.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Sure, the ending dragged on a bit, and it is good to get away from a cinema theatre with too many noisy kids inside, ( why, oh why, in Egypt do they let young kids - and I mean babies - into the cinemas ), but I did enjoy the film rather a lot.The evil characters, with their completely different characteristics, for me the Sandman was by far the best, and their varying motives and agendas, as well as the split personalities of Spiderman, ( personally I prefer the more conceited or the more evil Spiderman to the original wishy washy version - as I feel that the Police Commissioners daughter would be a much better catch than that boring red headed regular girlfriend ), made for a much better, more entertaining, all round appealing film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Villain on top of villain - tone change outside of tone change - poor Mary Jane is regarded with the same nonchalance...bouncing to and from the same 2 men. Raimi invests 15 minutes into the Sandman's backstory then drops him as a character til Venom requires a tag partner. One moment Tobey's got roid rage, the next he's strutting like Tony Manero from Flatbush. Poor flick requires a valium. Thankfully, amidst all the schizo ambitions, there are pleasures. The menace of the 'venom' is both well-realized as a possessory and malicious source of evil. Tobey glides through the material with his usual effusive ease. Villainy is far more suited to Topher's lizard eyes...and the special effects, especially the disintegrating grains of the Sandman.

May 4th was marked in my calendar for months leading up to the actual day. I watched Spider Man 3 on opening night and was left somewhat baffled. I liked the action, visually the film was stunning, but something didn't feel right. I was so disappointed. Although I was hyped up about the film, I also didn't go into it expecting the greatest film ever. But it was things like character development, story, and the overall theme of the film that dragged it. To describe this film in one word would be campy. This was definitely the campiest of all the films. In a film that was advertised as the darkest of the trilogy, instead we got too much comedy and a montage that was dragged on for too long. I couldn't help but cringe at these moments and wonder where did the magic, that was very evident in the previous films, go? As the credits rolled, I couldn't help but wonder what direction this franchise would go? These are questions that never crossed my mind after watching the previous films. Now Sony plans to include three more installments and I'm not even that excited anymore. To sum up everything, this film has its ""oohs"" and ""aahs"" but at the end it still proves to be one big disappointment.Spider-Man 3 - ** out of ****","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

This in turn gave us the personal issues of growing up we have come to expect from Parker's teenage angst. The 2nd movie was quite nearly perfect, the only real weakness (& now prevalent in all 3 movies) is when Raimi insists on sentimental flag-waving ""Spirit of America"" imagery. This third film is messy- sure, its packed with some amazing fights, but story-wise its the weakest of the 3 films. This is due mainly due to the plate-spinning script problems of introducing too many issues and characters. The FX sometimes fall short as well; The Sandman's ""birth"" is great- but his construction site finale ""monster"" is more reminiscent of the Marshmallow man of Ghostbusters! Sandman is convincingly (and sympathetically)played by Haden Church- a small miracle given the poorly structured arc of his journey. His character does things to service the inclusion of a big fight, or functionally join the plot holes, rather than aid the story itself. The characters are immersed in a soap opera script- they do things that have you wanting to shout ""Why don't they just tell one another whats on their minds?!""- Then, of course there would be no misunderstandings to unravel! But It would save screen time & allow a more structured story to unfold as we have come to expect from this franchise.And Sam Raimi?! How could you have taken your eye off the ball so much?! Could you please do a ""Director's Cut"" and lose ""Mr & Mrs Exposition""- that bloody butler and the annoying British Reporter- both used to fill in the yawning cavern of a plot hole (or Black Hole) that had been developing since the 45 minute mark.Shame to see Cromwell and Dallas Howard shoe-horned into the film and so underused.I still had fun watching it,if my criticism seems a little harsh- its because Spiderman movies have really shown what a Superhero movie can be. Unfortunately, this Three-quel, as with the X-Men, has fallen from the towering heights of the near perfect 2nd movie and slipped into an erratic, overly packed story. Sometimes less is more.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Peter Parker is a down-to-earth character. someone just like one of us and actually, in some scenes, he becomes ONE OF US.I cannot wait to see the fourth and even the fifth time Toby performs Peter because so unbelievably believable he does his job that one cannot tell Toby from Peter apart. As for the young Mary Jane, Kirsten Dunst, she's a beautiful actress, I mean a perfect one, and in some scenes she shows what she is made of, but generally her performance is not comparable to that of Toby Maguire. Kirsten Dunst has done all her best, but I do believe as a young and of course Promising young actress she can do it better.But there are some horrible mistakes in the last Spider movie,for example Harry's steward comes just out of nowhere, he comes out of blue and with a simple short saying changes an angry young man's insatiable appetite for revenge.... This steward wasn't even in the previous movies, at least he wasn't mentioned as an influential character.And for James Franco I do believe he is a great Harry Osborn but his change of direction, his shifting of horses in midstream and sacrificing his life for Spiderman that he has been so earnestly desiring to kill is bizarre.But we mustn't be oblivious of the fact that his performance has given us so much passion and pleasure in the previous movies and in here he has done the same job.One last and MOST IMPORTANT mistake of the movie or the producers is showing the stars and stripes too much, I cannot tell whether we are watching a movie or an advertisement of America's flag?? Why does Spidy always holds to the flag when this act seems most out-of-place???????

I found the second Spiderman film to be not only better on every level than the first, but also a very fine film in its own right.The third film premiered here in Japan and, having enjoyed the first two installments, I was reasonably excited about getting my advance ticket and waiting to see it. Unfortunately, after the screening, the strongest feeling I had was that of disappointment. It seems that this film is plagued with numerous, and more to the point *noticeable*, problems.It appears that these problems all stem from two root problems. Namely, there is too much happening for just one screenplay and, the quality of writing is low.As there is too much happening for just one screenplay, we have to keep track of multiple villains and civilians, each of whom has had only the bare minimum of introduction. This severely affects the action scenes because we don't know the characters well enough to get emotionally involved in the scene. In short, we don't even *care* about the characters. Another side-effect of this crowded screenplay is that we get a lot of very short scenes. Even the more dramatic scenes cut almost as soon as they've started. All of this makes for a very confusing, disjointed and dizzying experience.The quality of writing is low. This means we have to suffer such lines as ""Wicked cool!"" from a young boy in awe of Spiderman. Do young boys say ""Wicked cool!"" nowadays? Actually, have young boys *ever* said ""Wicked cool!""? The screenplay has clearly been rushed. The screenplay possibly explains why we get some sub-par acting from most actors involved. The scenes with the male and female news reporters are embarrassingly awful. Even the stars are unaffected. Verily, Tobey Maquire's ""lip quiver"" will go down in cinema history.There are, of course, some saving graces. The first half of the film provides more than a few genuinely funny, laugh-out-loud moments (although a lot of the humour in the second half feels out of place). Also, because of the quick cuts, you're never very far away from an action scene - if that's what you're looking for.This is certainly not the worst film ever made, but it is easily one of the most disappointing.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

And I will honestly say that I wasted my time.To be frank, I didn't like it one bit.There were some decent fight scenes and some of the special effects were neat, but the horrible acting by the extras and minor characters, the relentless soap opera drama, the horrendous dialogue, the over the top cheesiness, and the embarrassingly bad montages/unnecessary scenes were enough to make me regret the fact that I stayed up late to come to work and watch this movie.Sam Raimi was on a roll until now. Spiderman was pretty good, and Spiderman 2 was superb. Spiderman 3 is a waste of time and (for those that actually have to pay for movies) a waste of money.Some may enjoy this movie, and I sincerely hope they do.

First of all because this time Spider-man has to fight three villains. The action was great, though there were less of it but it was still very enjoyable and maybe even better than in second part (or maybe not). But the best thing about this film was, that not like in previous parts, in this part Peter's and Mary Jane's dialog scenes weren't boring. Actually this time it seemed that I'm watching more Peter Parker's movie, than Spiderman's movie. This time Peter showed the dark side of his and actually I felt sorry for those who he was hurting, even for Sandman. I liked Mary Jane's and also Harry's position in this film. There also was some comical moments. J.K. Simmons (which to me is better known as Vernon Schillinger from Oz) with his character were hilarious in this part.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

As a result, the characters are inconsistent, the action is sometimes not believable, and there is no single, coherent message, but a collection of competing story arcs that fall short of being inspirational.Supposedly, director Sam Raimi was disappointed in this film. That's too bad, considering the amount of talent and money spent making it. I think the film lost much of its emotional impact by being too cartoonish.

And this film is in no way comparable with Batman and Robin. Spider-man 3 is a good film but does not match the caliber of the first two films.Tobey Maguire (Peter Parker) and Kirsten Dunst (Mary Jane) return in the two big roles with OK performances. James Franco returns in his best performance of the three films. He portrays an angry, distressed, and loyalty-torn character. It is truly a solid Harry Osborne character and I give compliments to Mr. Franco for doing so well in this third installment. Thomas Haden Church did an awesome job as Sandman. I was very happy with the Sandman character and the way he was created in the story. I loved watching him fight and the visual effects done on Sandman were outstanding. Some of his powers seem to be exaggerated but his character is great. Topher Grace as Eddie Brock and the new big villain, Venom! I would say Grace does a good job with the Venom character created for him. I still disagree with the Venom/Eddie Brock characters they created in this film. He is too cocky, too arrogant, and too much of a ""wimp"". Although looking at this as just a film, he does a pretty good job. OH, and Bryce Dallas Howard is in this film as Gwen Stacey. Although her role is of no importance, it simply enhances two factors in the film. That is all her character does, she plays no critical/event changing role.Although I would say this is the darkest and grimmest Spider-man film (which I liked, this film had almost a different feel for it than the other two), it is also the funniest. J.K. Simmons (J. Jonah Jameson) returns in his hilarious performance as usual and Bruce Campbell delivers yet another hilarious cameo. Even Topher Grace is funny at times (in a sick sort of way). So although the film is dark and grim, there is still some good comedy in it.This film tries to fit a lot into a movie. They overflow the film with a lot of new characters who need introduced. Overall, they do an OK job but it could have been handled better. So it should be fairly enjoyable as a film with entertainment and a good/solid/overrun story. You will notice the tag-line for this film, ""The Battle Within."" I do not want to give away anything so just think about that line. Peter is obviously going to be torn apart by perhaps someone or something(?). The story revolving around ""The Battle Within"" is fairly good for a movie goer not judging the movie on its comic book characteristics. I think some of the effects are too ""video-gamish"" in this film. They are almost completely recognizable as fake. The best fight sequences are in this film which should be obvious since he is battling three villains. Spidey, you have completed an excellent trilogy up to this point. This third installment is a good film. Maybe not the best way they could have gone out, but it was certainly good enough. A must see for anyone who enjoyed either of the first two Spider-man films.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The third...however, is something of a disaster. Although it's not in the realm of Batman And Robin, it's vastly inferior to the two films that came before it.The main problem it would seem is the attempt to use two quite major villains (in the comic books) leaving both with little time to make much of an impact. In addition, Sam Raimi seems set on turning the franchise into a straight forward comedy with the poor decision to include scenes such as Peter Parker (aka Spider-Man of course) dirty dancing in a disco. Yes, that's right - we spend several minutes of the film being forced to watch Peter Parker dancing as though he's in Saturday Night Fever.Added to this is poor writing. At one point a character whom we'd never met in the previous two films suddenly appears and spouts several minutes of dialogue relating to a key scene in the first movie. Imagine, if you will, that upon watching Return Of The Jedi, an old man suddenly shuffles up to Luke Skywalker and says 'I was hiding behind a pillar when Darth Vader told you he was your dad. Don't worry - he's a good guy. Just believe in him and everything will be alright....' Yes, it's that bad.If you've never read the Marvel comics, you might possibly enjoy this and dismiss it as 'okay'. You'll be amazed by some of the action sequences, laugh at the cameo by Bruce Campbell as a French waiter and wonder why people bother reading comics if they're written like this. If you've actually ever had any affinity for the character of Spider-Man, you'll be angered and confused by some of the decisions made here (especially those involving Eddie Brock and Gwen Stacy).Disappointed.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

This movie was a complete embarrassment not only to the Spiderman franchise, but to cinema itself. It is truly difficult to point out the worst bit (and simply impossible to find just a tiny decent one), but the one thing that really hurt me all through this piece of celluloid junk, was how much of an insult to fans of the first movies this was. I have rarely felt like walking out on a movie, but last night I had to force myself to stay put. The director and writers obviously think that audiences are brainwashed creatures who will swallow anything as long as it has Spiderman in the title. Not so - I have never heard such consistent booing in a cinema as I did last night.

The multiple villains thing works because Peter and Harry have to team up to fight them at the end. Sandman and Venom could have had more development, but as they are they feel pretty good. The final battle is one of those few in movies where you actually fear for the hero, and they knocked it out of the park with the soundtrack throughout the film, which makes you emotionally invested with Peter's journey. All in all, you won't regret watching this film.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The special effects are worse than the first film at times, the romance between Maguire and Dunst takes several steps back and is arguably again somewhere within the first story, there are THREE, yes THREE villains in this movie...So, what happened? It almost seems like everyone involved either became complacent or bored. They know the movie will break the bank, as can be seen by its opening weekend, so are they just not putting forth the same effort? Spider-Man 2 was more than a comic book movie - it was a genuine film with ethos and pathos. Spider-Man 3 is computer schlock fest...two of the three villains are completely CGI 95% of the time. Where is the humanity? Where is the care factor? The only things this movie has going for it are its humor and one emotional scene on a bridge. While funnier than the first two films combined, is humor a substitute for the brilliance of SM2? And the bridge scene between Maguire and Dunst almost redeemed their entire relationship in my eyes, but the intensity doesn't last and is almost forgotten toward the end of the movie. Honestly, I'd recommend waiting for the DVD, if you haven't already seen it in the theatre.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Then there was the promising trailer,Raimi's passionate interviews(a fan himself) and the fact that I enjoyed the last two films immensely.Still (you can see it coming by now) I was indeed disappointed. Many of the first films' virtues are present as are some of their weaknesses.But while the former don't make the same impression the latter seem to be more tiring the third time around. Peter and MJ are constantly whining(unlike their comic counterparts)and new characters like sandman(who has a great beginning),Brock/Venom and Gwen, while they have rich history and potential are barely scratched(The use of Venom was ""enforced"" by the producers and Raimi having grown in the '60s/'70s was not familiar with the character).Also, the same plot twists are used again and the feeling of deja -vu is inevitable. The film greatly suffers by Raimi's struggle to fit too many plots and characters in the same movie and actually resolve everything before the end.After all, the multiple villain theme didn't work wonders on the Batman either.Each one of the sub-plots could easily support a movie on its own and give room to the characters to breathe.And why he infused the supposedly darkest chapter with such ridiculous light heartetness is a mystery. As I said though this is not a film without virtues.Raimi is still a magician with the camera and that shows at the action sequences that are manier than ever before.His love for the characters is a given so you get the feeling of an actual sequence unlike many similar films where everything is quite stale or radically changed.His talent also shows from the fact that New York is a co-star of this film (like before). Some will say it's a great film.Some will say it's the worst.I believe it was indeed a lost opportunity but if you manage to compromise with this fact you will actually have a good time.From a film like this though you expect a bit more.Like using the original black costume-(half)kidding...","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Tobey Maguire return as the Peter Parker, and give another touching performance as the human, torn between the woman he loves, the hero, and real life. This time, however, it seems to be working out. He's ready to propose to the love of his life, Mary Jane (great performance by Kirsten Dunst, btw), when the movie starts.Then a storm of different problems come into his life - getting attacked by his former best friend, and new information on the murder of his uncle (enter Sandman) just to mention a few - which causes him to loose sight of what really matters. The performance by all actors range between good and great, but one really steal the picture: Thomas Haden Church as Sandman, a small time crook turned robber to get money for his little daughters operation (socialized medicine, anyone?), busts out of jail to get the money for the operation.And again we see Sam Raimi follow in the footstep of some of the greatest of Marvels writers: Creating truly complex and believable characters - heroes aren't always perfect, villain aren't always evil. And not only that: The story allow the actors to show off their acting prowess. So a big thumbs up to the writers and director.Only disappointment in Spiderman 3 is the addition of Venom. I never liked him - in the comic it felt like he was being added to sell more comics (""omg Venom rox"") than to create a believable villain or move the story forward. Unfortunately, he'll probably be featured in Spiderman 4. Having said that, Sam Raimi actually manage to make Venom much more interesting than in the comic books. All in all, this is a worthy addition to the Spiderman-saga. On some points it's the best, as it moved on from the ""Peter Parker torn between love and Spiderman"", and showed a Peter Parker older and more at peace with himself. It's definitely the darkest of the three, and that's not in everybodies taste. But I loved it! Hope you will to ...","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The whole film just made me angry and disappointed. I can't say that it's a rubbish film, but compared to the other two, it's just plain horrible. The music is poor and in several places it's highly inappropriate. The action is quite standard, nothing really original and exciting. The effects are great, especially on sandman, but it's hard to appreciate them with the constant dodgy camera angles. For some reason the majority of the film is done with free hand camera work so the smooth flowing action scenes are a thing of the past. Venom isn't in it enough. The actions of the character are often pretty unexplainable. Dialogue is seriously cheesy. I don't know why it has been allowed to be released, it has ruined the series for me.

And let's not forget fighting inner demons caused by a living costume/goo from outer space.Sure, it could be better, but it could also be worse. The problem as I see it, is too many story lines. Besides the ones already mentioned there's the MJ story and the Gwen Stacy story. While some of the subplots were given time to grow, others weren't. It felt like they were thrown into a space too small for them to grow in the pace they needed. Guess Raimi got a little too eager in the big candy shop that is the Spider-Man-universe, and I can't blame him. On the plus side: the action scenes are very good and Thomas Hayden Church's portrayal of an ordinary man with bad luck, turned thug, turned super villain is good, memorable and makes you feels sympathy for the poor guy. Agreed, it's not as good as Spider-Man 2, but not bad either. It's good enough to watch more than a couple of times.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The end fight scene is a gorgeous 5 or 10 minutes. The rest is more or less all about Peter Parker and his problems with Mary Jane. After all that hype you hardly see any Venom at all. The Mary Jane Peter Parker dynamics did endear the first spiderman film, but it was interspersed with regular spiderman action. It complimented that film, a kind of cute back plot. In Spiderman 3 they have forgotten that the film is about spiderman. They concentrate on the peter parker and Mary Jane relationship, and how it devolves and then develops. The Spiderman action becomes a back plot, which they kind of remember to slot in every now and again.I went to see a film about spiderman, I expected it to be an action movie. But I didn't see either. Instead I watched a movie about relationships, and the pitfalls of taking your partner for granted. of not listening and becoming self involved. But not an action movie and certainly not a spiderman movie. Except for the odd 5 minutes here and there.A RANT:- When are Hollywood going to learn, if your doing a comic book movie, its fans of the comic book that will provide the biggest custom, but what we want to see is our comic book heroes. It doesn't matter who plays the lead, so we don't need nor want to see the actors face all the time. We want the hero mask and all. We want the action. We want the fast pace adrenalin rush. Also In spiderman 2 and 3 you see peters face too often whilst in spiderman costume. I mean who in the city hasn't seen spidermans face whilst he's in full costume? Is there anyone left who actually doesn't know his secret after 2 and 3? You don't need to keep showing us the actors face, we didn't come to see Tobey Maguire, we wanted to see spiderman.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

However it is a secondary part. In the third installment of the franchise Raimi fails to live up to the expectations set by his previous 2 forays into the Marvel Universe of Spiderman. In this third installment he spends too much time focusing on the romantic trials and tribulations of Peter and MJ, and too little time developing meaningful characters or entertaining story lines.In Spiderman he broke new ground, and set the franchise up to be the go-to summer blockbuster for fans of both the super hero and action genre. In Spiderman 2 he raised the bar, combining incredible action with story lines that were sure to please discerning film aficionados, and comic book fans alike. Balancing perfectly The Romantic story lines, with the dramatic ones, and interweaving them brilliantly with the action sequences that we expected.In the third installment perhaps he became a victim of the success of the first two. In this film he tries to do too much, too many characters, too many villains, getting too little screen time, and far too much teenage ""romantic angst"" combined with far too little Spiderman for a film bearing the title Spiderman. In addition, and perhaps most importantly, far too many song and dance numbers for a film not titled Chicago!In addition, in a move that, much like the first 2 films, I am certain was spurred by the egos of the films stars, Spiderman takes every chance he gets to remove his mask, or at least half of it. How everyone in New York does not know that Peter Parker is Spiderman I do not know. (I guess if they can not figure out that Clarke Kent is Superman it is feasible that they would not figure this out either). Two weeks ago I would have said that Tobey Maguire was Spiderman, and losing him would hurt the franchise, however after this installment, losing all of the big three (calling Dunst one of the big three gives me a bit of a pain, but...) would probably not hurt my feelings at all.Of course as with most films, not everything is bad, even though there is not nearly enough Spiderman for my liking, the action sequences that this film does contain are spectacular, if somewhat disconnected from the film, and if the film were under 100 min the amount of action in this ""action film"" would probably have been adequate, however for a film with a running time pushing two and a half hours Spiderman 3 was seriously lacking in action for stretches that seemed to drag on for an eternity while we suffer through the twist scene.The Good News is, this movie will make a fortune, so this very bad installment will not sink the Franchise, however the bad news is, this movie will make a fortune, and therefore the mistakes that were made may go unnoticed by the film maker.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The comics have all kinds of time to write out and expand on each villain, but a movie I think is more realistic, because sometimes life gives us more than we can handle. So the way Peter Parker deals with different issues is very realistic. This also gives us great moments like when he realizes what the suit is doing to him and when he is getting ready for the final battle and looks at his old suit. The character arcs and relationships are wrapped up very well and villains all have clear motivations. Every character in this movie is conflicted, except of course characters that aren't supposed to be like Aunt May.

But much to my dismay the movie was terrible in every aspect other than special effects. Directing - 2 thumbs down Acting - 2 thumbs down Writing - 2 thumbs downMost movies that are not very good, I can actually stand to watch for the full duration of the movie, but Spider-Man 3 had me wanting to jump out of my seat and run out of the theater about 15 different times during the movie. There were a few good parts of the movie, but then the writers had to kill it again. I would have walked out of the movie if it wouldn't have been for the fact that I drove 15 miles out of my way and payed 10.25 to see this piece of trash. I would have to say that I mostly blame the director Sam Raimi, who had previously directed the 1st and second movie, but for the 3rd he decided to direct and write it along with his older brother Ivan Raimi. In short, neither of them should EVER touch a screen play. It also appears that they axed the two writers (Stan Lee and Steve Ditko) of the first 2 movies who appear to be the creative knowledge of Marvel Comics, creating such characters as Spider-Man, the Fantastic Four, the X-Men, the Hulk, Iron Man, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, and many other characters. But here is some good news folks. According to IMDb they are bringing back San Lee and Steve Ditko back for the fourth movie. So there is hope for #4 being good again.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Unlike the other spider-man movies it never came off clearly what part some characters played and why, but in this one the characters were developed very well. and also some new characters were brought into the movie which made it more entertaining but confusing at the same time. The movie also had a good job with the special affects. The fight scenes were really good and well played out.

Riding on the success of the first 2 Spiderman movies, I think it's damn near impossible to do much better. Though I love Sam Raimi and typically back him on just about every project he does (pending good reason of course), he would be making a fool of himself trying to make anymore Spiderman films.Episode 3 finds us with Spidy facing more personal issues and even more bad guys. I was thrilled with the fact that Raimi choose to have more than one bad guy for the film, in fact it's about time. I hated that he cast Topher Grace as Venom when there was a much more physically qualified actor playing Flash in the first one. That decision I will never understand. I was expecting worse from the story lines but they were actually okay. Bottom line, I pray that Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst put their feet down about not making another Spiderman, they deserve better. But knowing the production companies, they will probably dangle a couple of juicy carrots in front of both of them to get them back. We shall see.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

They two terrific films. This on the other is just not. It's very sub par. Although it was bad their were some alright moments. Here's a good break down.Good Moments- All of the action sequences are very well done. Topher Grace does a terrific job as Eddie Brock. All the other actors are fine expect for Tobey. Here comes the bad.Bad- The script, it goes everywhere with out going anywhere. By this I mean it touches a lot of subjects, such as introducing Venom, Sandman, Eddie Brock,and Gwen Stacy. It tries but, it fails to hit all the plot points well. Spiderman dancing was also pretty bad. It didn't feel like Spiderman, it felt like the filmmakers were making a joke of Spiderman with terrible dialog and cheesy scenes. Sandman wasn't that cool either. I don't want to ruinin it , but they try to show that he is good guy. It doesn't work. Tobey Maguire is bad in this movie. Not as the normal Read Suit Spiderman, but as the black suited Spiderman. He tries to act cool and still acts dorky. Score wasn't as good. Overall: If you liked the other two than you will despise this. Okay you might like it, but it is by far the weakest in the series. Please don't go see it. Rebel this awful film. I hate to say it, but is the most disappointing pre- summer movie and probably of 2007. Overall 1/5","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was astounded by the black suit, the action scenes, the special effects are really incredible, the story line is good, and VENOM is perfect. It ended the series perfectly well, then when it came to DVD, I got the 2-disc DVD release and I love the behind the scenes of the movie. Although the movie had good and bad reviews but it still became a blockbuster, It also became the highest grossing movie of 2007 beating every movie in 2007 including:Pirates 3, Transformers, and Rob Zombie's Halloween, It was a smash hit placing is #21 in the U.S Box Office over 336 million dollars. To be quite honest I really wanted to see SPIDER- MAN swinging at the end of the 3rd film but what the heck, I never really wanted to see more of spider-man I wanted to see peter out of his costume and fight but I got my wish and I give it 2 thumbs up and 5 stars and mostly SPIDER-MAN 3 is my personal favorite spider-man movie of all time.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The first Spidey movie was just cool: a good adaptation of the comic and a fun movie all around. The second one was just a little under the first. And now comes the third one... or as I like to call it ""the big steaming pile of monkey crap"". Spider-man 3 is just a money maker. A weak move with a big budget behind it and a  so it sells (Batman and Robin). It was played horribly and written even worse. Peter P.'s character was a nerd by day yes but they just don't point out Spidey's sarcastic humor. And is it just me or does Tobey really sucks in this movie. In the first to he wasn't good but he plaid his best. Now he just is there; doing nothing.The script has been modified for dramatic reasons and has deviated from the original comic. In my opinion that is just a stab in the hearts of the true fans. I will not spoil how the story was ruined but the fans will know when they will see this movie. It also has a tearjerker ending. The Movie also is what I call a skipper. It skips needed scenes for the plot and jambs to much in to little time. If the movie was longer maybe it would have been a little better. It is a movie I recommend downloading. It does not deserve the money you give to go to the cinema or renting it. It killed Spider-man in cinema for me (much like ""B&R"" killed Batman; maybe we have a Spider-man returns with a better actor to re-launch the series a few years from now :D)To sum it up: bad acting, bad script, bad directing, bad casting. Good special effects.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Many which are visually stunning. However, a number of questions are brought up. The biggest one that came up in my mind was why is this relevant to the story in the first place? The plot has Parker dealing with 3 villains this time. Harry Osbourne (of course), but in addition, there are 2 new villains. This is where the problem begins to unfold. The first new villain is called ""The Sandman"", an escaped convict who gets trapped into a sand experiment, and develops super natural powers that involve sand (Hmm, we've never seen scenario this in the first two...). This is the most visually amusing part of the movie, and Thomas Haden's acting is very good (he looks so big you could barely tell it's him), ironically this is probably the least relevant villain. We don't find out what his motives are. He doesn't want to destroy the world, nor does he want to actually kill Peter Parker, it doesn't seem he has much relation to the trilogy is. However, we find out in the beginning that he was the man who murdered uncle Ben in reality, which is the perfect plot device to throw him in (though this does impact a fairly good message at the end, though I won't go into that.The 2nd villain is called Venom. He is somewhat more relevant to Parker's daily life, but the problem here is turning him into a villain. He is originally portrayed as the goofy, nerdy photographer competing with Parker for a job. A good role that seems fine and well fit for a comedic and likable actor like Topher Grace. He is humorous, and inept of course. It seems awfully awkward to see him become the villain later on in the movie. How does he become one? Well, we find out there is this dark germ of some kind (again, unexplainable), that attacks people and turns them into bad guys. This initially attacks Peter at first, which sets up for an idea ""Superman 3"" practiced over 20 years ago, in which Peter becomes the bad, aggressive guy. This sets up for another strange sub-plot, including Peter becoming the lady's man, as well as ruining other people's lives, which in turns leads to trouble for him later on.It doesn't end there! The movie puts in even more sub plots! Mary Jane and Peter's relationship is focused in here, and is tempted by Peter kissing Topher Grace's girlfriend, and Mary Jane as a failed Broadway actress, as well as a love affair between Mary Jane and Harry. Harry also suffers from long term memory loss, which makes him forget Peter killed his father, but only for a while.Are you lost with all these plots? I don't blame you. While not necessarily confusing, the movie has way too many pointless plots. As previously stated, there doesn't seem to be so much of a major conflict. After a while, you start to realize why the first two are so much better. They stick to one plot, and make it easier to follow and build on. It is hard for them to maintain a good plot and good characterizations with so many things going on, especially when these things are short and irrelevant to the plot. It lacks depth, and innovation.Now, the positive with the movie. It has it's ups, for sure. It is visually very well made, with great special effects, and good action scenes. They actually do make you root for the characters. This really does save the movie from tanking all the way. It makes a 2/10 movie, into a 5/10 movie. The effects in the scenes, really do make you root for characters, and keeps you on the edge, even if plot isn't so great. It also has a very good sense of humor, equally, or maybe even funnier then the first two.However, the best part of the 3rd film, is it's ending, and message. Now, I can't say what happens, but it takes an ultimately non-violent resolution and has a good message with forgiveness and doesn't take the typical, cheesy violent action packed way out (I won't tell you what happens though). This also does really help the overall impact of the movie.At it's best, ""Spider Man 3"" is visually effective, humorous, and thrilling. At it's worst, it is clichéd, uneven, overlong, overly complex, abstract and formulaic. It ultimately can't top the first 2, and it is somewhat disappointing, though it is a decent movie.I give it 5/10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Another problem with this movie is that all of the story lines are ended abruptly and in a very unconvincing way.The special effects were OK at times, but for the most part the movie looked more like a video game than like something that was supposed to be convincing. The action moved too quickly and was too dark to follow most of the time, which left me more confused than impressed most of the time.I loved the first two Spider Man movies, and I was very excited to see the third one, but unfortunately the entire movie was a disappointment.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was supposed to raise the bar for movies of this genre. It was supposed to give us characters that we could cheer for, villains we could root against, and relationships that culminate in trademark upside-down kisses. Unfortunately, Spider-Man 3 gives us none of these things. Peter Parker/Spider-Man, arguably the greatest and most intriguing superhero of the comic book world, is given the hack treatment by Sam Raimi and his collaborators. Instead of a fully realized portrait of a Superhero who deals not only with supervillains, but with relationship issues, family crises, and the unique moral nature of his position, we are given a contrived story in the same vein as the new installments of the Star Wars franchise. Bottom line: there's nothing there. In the first two Spider-Man films, Raimi created a world where the characters were likable, if not always well-portrayed, and at least attempted to create a story with some semblance of originality. With this latest film, he has substituted that originality with some of the most painful and awkward contrivances I've ever seen on film. Expository butlers, convenient cases of amnesia, and a ludicrous villainous alliance only scratch the surface of a badly flawed, poorly written, woefully underdeveloped film. The only character I ended up rooting for was Gwen Stacy. At least she brought a sense of excitement to the scenes she was in, something that can't be said for Mary Jane. And while many have said the film was saved by its ""amazing"" special effects, I can't help but disagree. While many of them were spectacular, in particular the origin sequence of Sandman, overall they seemed lackluster. There is a lot to be said about this film, mostly negative, but I'm running out of space. Sam Raimi, meet George Lucas, the other notorious destroyer of classic franchises. It's time you two got acquainted.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie was cheesy, too underdeveloped, and just plain bad. I found myself laughing at the, ""serious"" parts of the movie rather than shedding a tear or feeling suspenseful. Performances that were given were alright, but they weren't great. Tobey Maguire is a great actor, and he was slightly mediocre in this film. James Franco did alright too, but nothing as good as the second movie where he played the vengeful part so well. Kirsten Dunst was just whiny and unconvincing. Bryce Dallas Howard, who is a great talent, got very little screen time and was completely underused as an actor, which is very sad. The same goes for Topher Grace, who should have been the focal point villain in the movie because he was so good at it, but he was only a villain for the last part of the movie. Thomas Hayden Church is a great actor, who trained over a year for this film, and he just played the part of a meathead convict who had bad luck? The whole movie was crap. The story lines were just too bad and too many and they left me and my fellow viewers unsatisfied at the end of the movie. After Spider-Man 2 I was thinking, the only way to go is up, but Spider-Man 3 plummets. It will definitely bring in a big box office, but it is the worst ending to a trilogy I have ever seen. I am saddened by this because I want to own the trilogy, but I can't force myself to watch this movie again. If you like cheesy lines and underdeveloped story, then this is the movie for you. The only good thing about this movie is the special effects, as always. But seriously, think twice before going to see this movie in the theaters, you may want that 2 hour and 20 minute period of your life back, I know I did.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) has accepted her role as the web-swinger's fiancé, and is preparing her own success story as a Broadway singer. Peter's best friend Harry Osborn and son of the late Green Goblin (James Franco) however, is slowly succumbing to the 'voices' of his father. In addition, there are two new villains, The Sandman (Thomas Church) and Venom (Topher Grace) who are destined to challenged and threaten the Spiderman. If that is not enough, a strange and powerful Symbiote life force arrives from outer space to ensure that Parker's life becomes anything but happy.

Tim Burton gave way to Joel Schumacher, Richard Donner was replaced by Richard Lester who was replaced by Sidney J. Furie, and Brian Singer became a name of the past as Brett Ratner stepped into his chair. Then Sam Raimi swooped in to save the day with his Spider-Man movies. This unprecedented continuity should have made it the first superhero series to have a successful third film. It should have, but it did not.Sure, it is and will continue to be a smashing success at the box office, but from an artistic standpoint, it fails. The principals that made the first two films so delightful are not present anymore. The Spider-Man films have gone from an uplifting and unique experience to an exercise in gorging sensationalism and sliding standards.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has finally found the ideal balance between college, work and his responsibilities as the masked hero of the city. His grades are immaculate and he is ready to propose to his girlfriend Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Mary Jane has recently opened her career as a Broadway singer. He is about to receive the key to the city after rescuing Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard), the daughter of a police captain (James Cromwell). Life could not be better.That must change, of course, and this time the problem is threefold. First, Harry Osborn (James Franco) has decided to follow his father's footsteps and become the New Goblin. The second comes from an escaped convict named Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) who is zapped by antimatter whilst fleeing from police, turning him into the Sandman. The third is a sticky mass of black spindles from outer space (CGI) that adheres to one of his Spider suits.The black ""creature"" is an alien symbiote that amplifies anger and aggression in its host. Parker soon changes into a cruel, self-centered jerk. He wounds Mary Jane's soul deeply and repeatedly until he is at imminent risk of alienating her permanently.The most conspicuous problem with this film is the inclusion of too many antagonists. As difficult as it is to compress two villains into a movie, not to mention the Man vs. Self conflict that occupies much of the film, it grows more convoluted when Venom (Topher Grace) finally shows his face.The Green Goblin and Dr. Octopus were complex, carefully-constructed characters and had a large share of the movie to themselves. It was not until midway through the films that they first fought with Spider-Man, and much time and effort had been invested into the characters by then. The three villains here are in constant conflict for more screen time and none of them are given a fair portrayal. Venom in particular is badly cheated. He is probably the most well known Spider-Man adversary after Doctor Octopus, but he is only minimally seen in the waning moments. Even then, the camera never focuses on his face long enough to let the audience drink in the impressive visual it is.The film wastes no time with its first violent encounter, an aerial chase between Spider-Man and the New Goblin. It contains by far the movie's best action, but is hampered by problem number two; nobody dies once. We are teased and fooled too many times for the fabric of the film not to tear. Various characters are stabbed, drowned and blown up without fatal consequence. One character even hits his head with near decapitating force and falls to the unforgiving pavement yet survives. Perhaps they all received a gift from Wolverine.Sandman is another mammoth blunder. He is completely invulnerable to damage and grows so big Godzilla would be proud. He is literally twenty stories tall at one point and missiles only cause giant sand splashes. Raimi also rips off The Mummy by granting him the ability to disintegrate into a sandstorm. The special effects are so spectacular the Academy can probably hand the movie the Oscar now, but Sandman was never meant to be Imhotep, and the problem is literally too huge to ignore.The black Spider-Man segments go too far. We ended Spider-Man 2 elated that Mary Jane and Peter had finally discovered the true romance that had been growing for so long. Instead of a continuation of that element, the fledgling romance is systematically destroyed. The drama is undeniably good, but watching Mary Jane being shoved through the ringer over and over is extremely difficult to watch. The bridge scene is especially tough and had many in the opening night audience in tears, but this element is ill-timed and should have been put off for the fourth film.Even the action is not right. Most of the time, the camera is zoomed in so closely and travels so quickly that we can hardly take in what is happening and the problem is exacerbated by a plethora of quick cuts. It is confusing.Every such scene illustrates that Sam Raimi has changed his directing style. The Bond movies, for example, stand in contrast. Terence Young, Guy Hamilton, John Glen and Martin Campbell directed all of their films the same way. Only Lewis Gilbert changed, and the result was Moonraker and his ignominious end in the franchise.Stalwart regulars as J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Harris) and Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) are underused, which further distances the movie from its two predecessors. The second film ended with a hanging storyline involving Jameson that held great promise, but it is abandoned. There are strong themes of redemption and forgiveness, which along with the fine acting, particularly from Dunst and Church, help elevate the film, but its mistakes are too critical and numerous for it to rate any higher than a five out of ten.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Such is the case with this movie, where there are so many plot lines that it would make for an incredible movie, but in the end, feels like there is really no balance to this outing.In this outing, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) has finally found a balance with his life, able to cope with being Spider-Man, a dutiful lover to Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), an excelling college student and a capable worker as a photographer for a newspaper. Yet this newfound balance has gone to his head as Parker starts to become self-focused, turning a blind eye to the suffering of Mary Jane, who's received some pretty scathing reviews from her first major Broadway production.This newfound selfishness doesn't help much when Parker learns that his father's real killer wasn't the one who died in front of him in the first part, but was a man named Flint Marko (Thomas Hayden Church) who, through pretty bizarre circumstances, becomes the Sandman, a person who's genetic make-up is made entirely of sand. Thirsty for revenge, Parker leaves himself open to a symbiote that crashed down to earth and attached itself to him, amplifying his powers through his anger.Throw in a story about a wanna-be photojournalist Eddie Brock, who is developing a hatred for Peter Parker, a model named Gwen Stacey who makes Mary Jane jealous, and Harry Osborne, who experiences a temporary memory loss (typical in most comic book story lines) and feels Peter is still his best friend, all vengeful thoughts put aside. Any one of these stories, heck, even any two of these stories, would make for a great and fun summer flick, but with the movie being a trim two hours and twenty minutes (I use the term trim loosely because for all the story lines, it should be longer for the audience to have a sense of closure by the end), feels a tad rushed and convoluted whereas it follows up a brilliant sequel that took it's time to develop it's story, relate all of it's characters and give them all a good climax for their stories by the end.Here, Spider-Man 3 simply seems like a bad stew, many enjoyable moments, some funny scenes (particularly one with a maitre'd who everyone should recognize), and some convincing performances, most notably from Kirsten Dunst this time around, who brings a humanity to Peter Parker's love interest, something that seemed missing from the first two parts. But with all of these ingredients, they never really blend together and the movie simply collapses under the weight of it's numerous story lines.While still a good slice of summer fun, Spider-Man 3 fails to live up to it's predecessor, which was near cinematic perfection, transcending the genre of super-hero movie to becoming a thoughtful character piece.

This is just a B movie with an extremely high budget, which left me very disappointed after watching it.Although most of the action sequences can be enticing, the time spent waiting for them to happen is when you can see the rest of the audience checking their cellphones or doing their nails. All of the lead cast seem unable to act their way out of a paper bag and the script isn't helping them any. You can't go one minute in this movie without something horribly corny being said, a hole in the plot, or a complete waste of screen time on something completely irrelevant.Tobey Macguire leaves much to be desired with his constant Keanu Reeves impressions and self-consciousness, whilst Kirsten Dunst and James Franco seem to do nothing but glaze over their lines without any emotion. Meanwhile Topher Grace was simply a bad choice for Venom, who - despite being Spider-Man's number one nemesis - comes off as a puppy dog. Thomas Haden Church's performance is admirable, though once again, he's another actor bogged down by the script. The only really good performances that rise above the script are that of J.K. Simmons and Elya Baskin who of course have tiny comedic roles, yet somehow became a cut above the rest of the more experienced actors. And apparently they just let the extras do whatever they wanted, because in every scene they stand around like idiots and fail to give any reality to their setting. If someone shoots a gun ten feet away - you would RUN.As for the visuals, although breathtaking at times, even some of them leave the audience wondering how the production company expected people to take it as truth. One of the visuals reminded me of a low budget B movie made in the mid-90s with its bad computer graphics.However, I do have to applaud the music. Although I swear one of the pieces is stolen from The Hulk movie (which, by the way, was far better than this garbage), every piece of the score is accurately put to the story and is very nice to listen to.Rent this movie only if you're a Spider-Man freak, or just interested in being entertained for the ten minutes of great visuals. I'm still at a loss as to how the first two movies in this trilogy could be fairly good, and this one (with the same actors and director) completely bombs.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Sandman was introduced as an antagonist, as Raimi found him a visually fascinating character.While Sandman is a petty criminal in the comics, the screenwriters created a background of the character being Uncle Ben's killer to increase Peter's guilt over his death and challenge his simplistic perception of the event.

It was a Spider-man movie after all and one that had so much hype about it. I love Spider-man. I tried to reason: the plot wasn't so bad, it had optimal doses of humour, the theme was alright, the animation was excellent. That's pretty much all the good, I could say about it!The dialogues were childish, misplaced, poorly delivered by the actors in the most careless of manners. The overall acting was also not fulfilling. Only a little trembling of the lips doesn't really work. A few scenes that were meant to be emotionally heavy, actually seemed funny. Every scene seemed to have a dose of everything.The worst part, was that the movie seemed to be in a hurry, which during the actions scenes was great but definitely not in the emotional scenes. The introductions of the villains also seemed too haphazard. Each wasn't properly engraved into the plot. The plot was highly predictable.Considering the stage created by the first two movies, with their mature dialogues, well enacted scenes and overall completeness, the third is a serious let-down for fans and others, as well. It could have really been better!!!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It may just be a matter of taste, but I much prefer this one than the first two, or 'The Amazing Spider-Man' movies. The thing that this movie gets the best is a sense of overwhelming chaos, both of internal struggles and external; it is true also that the plot rushed itself towards the end but that just gives the finale that Grand feeling which this franchise really deserves!
This movie also does really well in connecting all of it's predecessors together while maintaining that fresh feel. If you like Spider-Man movies and/or the comics you wont be disappointed! I don't know how the villain's origin(s) stayed true to it's original sources because I didn't read much of Spider-Man, but they surely work for this movie.
The plot was rich in it's diversity and not a one scene feels boring or out of place. 
I sat there for over 2 hours in aw the whole way through.Now this is not a professional review but I still think that this movie doesn't deserve all the criticism that it receives, much like the 'Avengers'; it is just a really ambitious flick that tries to appeal to all the demographic resulting in a controversial must-watch.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I had heard it wasn't very good, but took the plunge anyway. But wow, people really weren't kidding! The script really felt like it was pulled together by a few 10 year old comic book fans. The inclusion of three villains (Sandman, Venom, and the new Goblin) was just too much. Plus Blacksuit Spidey. All the stories sort of started and then just dropped off in a really unfulfilled and half-baked fashion. Raimi really should have just stuck to the Symbiote and the new Goblin (if he really wanted). The Sandman added nothing to the story. But the villain overload is something that has been discussed over and over.What I'd love to mention is the obscenely stupid inclusion of Petere's little...emo phase. That was just dumb on so many levels. I don't know if that was supposed to be a joke or what, but it was a completely unwanted and unnecessary 10 minute interlude.The romantic thing was muddled and annoying as well. I don't need to get into that as well as the fact that it's been discussed time and time again.In short, the first two movies were not masterpieces, but enjoyable fun...this however was a disgrace. It was pulled together from the brains of a million little fanboys with no apparent oversight by someone wishing to pull together a coherent story. I really don't even think they tried. I was also really saddened to see that Sony doesn't learn it's lesson and has signed up for three more movies. Ugh. Sequels really are death.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was OK with this, because, up until this sequel, I had an appreciation for the films that was separate from my love of the comics. But to my surprise, this film not only destroyed the original story line, it completely ruined the trilogy as well.This film seemed incredibly rushed. The plot was everywhere, all at once. The dialog was HORRIBLE. The acting was laughable. Almost nothing actually made sense, and you could tell the actors knew that. I was beginning to wonder if anybody involved in the movie had ever actually read a Spider-Man comic before, or if they were just taking ideas and basic concepts and manipulating them. My festering and ever-increasing hatred for Sam Raimi peaked the night I watched this movie. The director I once idolized for the Evil Dead trilogy, I now put in the same category as Uwe Boll.Story-line differences aside, this was just a horrible movie. Don't pay to watch it. If you have to see it, then rent it from McDonalds for a buck in a few months. If you have kids, and they are either under the age of 10 or haven't seen that many movies, then bring them, because they can most likely look past the awful awful script and enjoy the well choreographed, though not always logical, fight scenes (I say most likely because you will get the occasional ""Mommy, why did he just say that?"" and ""Why are they all crying??"").","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

With the first film, I was awed by the fact that the team could actually pull off a realistic movie. The second film had a great story and some amazing action. But this third installment fell very flat in my opinion given the expectations. The story was weak, as many have said -- too many stories were packed in. The action was few and far in between. The whole Symbiote / Venom story line was severely short-changed. The entire movie could / should have been based on this story line, which would have been far superior. Overall, I think that it is time for Raimi's saga to end. This is turning into Batman 1,2,and 3. The only way another Spiderman should be made is if the writer/directors are changed, as in Batman Begins. Raimi is getting too campy / corny / cheesy / kiddie to bear. The Spiderman series needs to be brought to a new and higher level, and only someone new can do it. This is coming from a Spiderman fan who obviously loved what Batman begins did for that series. However, for non spider-man lovers, I think you will find this movie to be fun to watch but with plenty of slow and boring moments, far too many for a spider man film.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Many people claim it's a bit to much, but I think it's an epic ending to an epic trilogy. Tobeys performance as Peter/Spidey is incredible, the story is good and the visual effects are beautiful. I can understand why many people think it's too much though, cause after all there are three villains, love conflicts and black suit all mixed up, but I think it works. There are so much good things here. It really takes you on an emotional roller-coaster for over two hours. It got something that many big movies misses, it got heart and soul. I've watched this movie (as well as the first two) a lot of times, and I always get so sucked up in it, that I almost forget I'm back in the real world again after watching it. You can feel the lust for revenge, the heartache and the responsibility of being Spider-Man while you watch it. It simply rocks big time. At least almost as good as the two first.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I heard rumors he had Venom shoved down his throat, and if that's true -- boy, it shows! The character is even more lame and shallow than he is in the comics (if such a thing is possible).Spider-Man 3 tries so hard to fit all these different personalities in that nothing is given a chance to develop, and the final product is nothing but a lifeless action film along the lines of X-Men 3.While Thomas Haden Church does a fantastic Sandman, he is wasted on an infantile script that not only violates his and Spider-Man's origin, but also is responsible for one of the glaring plot holes in the movie.Mary Jane is reduced to a jealous, useless persona, while Aunt May walks in and out of the film spouting platitudes with no substance.Also, there are at least two scenes that are absolutely cringe-worthy and should have been left on the cutting room floor, or never included in this awful script from the start! Lastly, the costume. While in the comics it was very stylish with its large white spider design -- the movie design is merely the regular costume dunked in black dye and is amazingly boring to look at.I'm so tired of comic films wasting their potential on awful third installments because the viewing public is so programmed to automatically like this kind of garbage. So, while this isn't the worst movie of all time by a long shot, its inexcusable lack of quality following two of the greatest comic films ever in Spider-Man 1 & 2 earns part 3 a rating of... 3.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was annoyed by the predictability (for example in the final fighting sequence everyone expected Harry to appear and help Spiderman), the unconvincing ""moral lessons"" (God may forgive, but the society and the law should not: if someone robs, kills and causes mass destruction, his place is in jail, not being let go, and pitied that he really wanted the money but was not able to get it with honest work), the flag (not this flag at this moment, when it represents, and is used by, an administration that started an unprovoked and unjustified war, which is going on for more than 4 years, longer than WWII, and which cost the lives of 120000 people, and counting).But when I came back home, I felt puzzled, there was something else in the movie that I really did not like but could not identify, something that was really missing, but I felt it only subconsciously, I could not formulate it. Then I compared Spiderman with the Pirates and Shrek, and it hit me, it was the humor! Spiderman 3 completely, totally lacked any light and humorous moments (not that the previous two installments were any better). The Pirates was great for humorous moments, they lighten you up, lift the spirit, make you smile, laugh, and feel happy. Nobody laughed for 2.5 hours tonight, it felt like being in a funeral home!Bottom line: Spiderman sucks! Since Shrek is mostly for kids, I hope the Pirates will be the movie that will be a real joy to watch this summer.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Spider-man 2 was an excellent one. It was its mix of action, romance and subtle character development that made it, in my opinion, one of the all time greatest movies. So you can understand how much I was looking forwards to Spider-man 3. And as good as it is, I was still disappointed.The film is too disjointed. For example there are far too many identical scenes where M.J. walks into Peter's apartment, tries to open up to him, he pushes her away and she leaves. This happens about three times in the film, when twice or even once would have sufficed.There are also some silly plot points, such as Harry loosing his memory in the first half of the film. This is obviously Sam Raimi realising that he jumped the gun, revealing peters identity to Harry in the second film.There are three villains this time. Harry Osborne and The Sandman are both excellent, easily better than the first film's Green Goblin, and almost rivalling the second film's Doc Oc. Unfortunately Venom is not so well done. Topher Grace plays him competently enough, and the character works well as the dorky, pathetic, slightly perverted Eddie Brock. However when he gets hold of Peter's symbiote suit, his character doesn't develop at all. He's still the same old Eddie just in a black suit. ""My spidey sense is tingling, if you know what I mean!"" he giggles at one point. He seems more like the typical sex obsessed teen from one of those naff high school movies, than a superhero's arch nemesis.The action scenes are all very enjoyable, even if a few of the ones with The Sandman are a little too short. However the massive 4-way battle at the end more than makes up for this.But as enjoyable as Spider-man 3 is, it's too messy to be considered a classic like the first two. Keeping in mind that the third part of a superhero movie franchise is traditionally disappointing- Superman 3, X-men the last stand, Batman Forever, Blade Trinity- compared to these films, Spider-man 3 is a masterpiece.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Kirsten Dunst is the only good actress in this film everybody else is corny and overdone so we feel emotions for them.The fight scenes are so horrible i wanted to use my popcorn bucket as a barf bag and the apparent love story is like an episode of Young and The Restless.Spiderman 3 is so bad you wish it were only an hour and a half long but no Sam Raimi chooses to torture us with a 3 hour long movie in other words three hours of wanting to gouge out your eyes.Spiderman 3 is just like that other glorified music video 300 without the special effects both movies would suck as their bad story lines, horrible acting, and childish action sequences would be exposed.So far this years films have all been brutal TMNT sucked, Grindhouse was pretty bad, 300 was despicable, and now Spiderman 3 another money sucking video game cut scene extended for 3 hours.Now i get to look forward to the third Pirates Of The Carribbean and Transformers two movies that look just as bad as this film.Hollywood needs to stop this horrible comic book craze as everyone of them has been too terrible for words.

The intrepid Parker is on top of the world as N.Y.C. citizens have finally come to appreciate all of his heroic deeds, but more importantly he's found a stable relationship with Mary Jane Watson. His seemingly perfect existence comes to an abrupt halt when he learns that his uncle's real killer is still at large, acquires a rival at the Daily Bugle, and best friend-turned-bitter adversary Harry Osborn comes seeking revenge. Peter also bonds with an unusual black symbiote that unleashes a darker side of him and threatens to destroy everything he holds dear. Some effective moments of intense, exciting action and superior special effects are undermined by overlength, and juxtaposed against moments of corny, unintentionally funny human drama. The ingredients for a success are there, including a good cast and some interesting subplots, but they can't overcome a leaden script which chooses to revel in its mawkish material rather than flesh out its characters or tell a coherent story. Watchable, but never as engaging or spectacular as its predecessors. **½","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

To start, I disliked this movie. Not so much the ideas conceived, as much as the execution.Most of the problems I had with this movie rest solely on the shoulders of the director, Sam Raimi. Now, lets get one thing out of the way. I like Sam Raimi. I like his movies. I understand that he disliked the idea and concept of bringing a character like Venom to the big screen. It truly shows his heart was not in the character as most of his time was clearly placed in the Sandman character, and it does show. In my opinion, Sandman could have been easily left out of this movie entirely. His character only bogs down the story. Sam Raimi publicly stated he only wanted to include SandMan this time around. This also shows. I really hate bashing this movie. A lot of it I liked, but the sub-par music started to annoy me early on and the movie itself is aimed directly at children. These villains, especially Venom, seem far too sympathetic and sappy. They should be mean, any fan of the vintage Spider-man, including the Symbiote story know exactly what I am talking about. The villains are supposed to be much tougher, much grittier. Spider-man 2 was aimed more at the adult fans then solely at children; again this was not the case. Too much information was thrown out with no depth; characters were briefly introduced, but no follow through or resolution. It reminded me a lot of watching the third Xmen movie, again excellent ideas, poor execution. I got a little off point. The music. Yes, that music. I love Danny Elfman. Nearly every single one of his scores are made to perfection. Haunting, yet very distinctive from other composers. Mr. Elfman left this picture to make Charlottes Web. He was really missed. It was simple to tell where his original themes ended, and the below-average composer Christopher Young's score took over. It started out as a small annoyance, by the end of the movie, I felt like scratching my nails against a chalkboard. It just didn't flow or fit in the movie at all. I don't want to hear sappy pop jazz music while a crucial fight is happening on the screen.I'm just about through, so much that I won't bother sharing what i think are the good things about this movie. Go see it for yourself and decide. This is my verdict: Fans and children who liked and have only seen the movies and don't know the comic book history will love this movie, loyal Spider-man fans will be very Disappointed.Thank you for reading.

There is not 1 scene in the movie he's likable. And the screenplay is so bad that I counted 7 acts that were totally contrived and filled with cliché' and contradiction. A monkey in a coma could have written a better screenplay. Pathetic. They should have donated the $258 million dollar budget to some charity that helps monkey writers in comas. Poor monkeys.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

""Oh, what a tangled web they weaved"".This movie was the biggest car wreck of a movie I've been to since ""Battlefield Earth"". But at least I expected that to suck. I was a huge fan of the previous two entries in the Spider-Man franchise. They were very enjoyable and they stayed true to their source material. This movie made it all up as they went along and showed just enough hints of greatness to keep me saying to myself right up until the end ""any minute now, this movie will be awesome"". It never was.One word sums it up. Overkill. Two many characters (some of them completely needless) and two many plots. All throughout the film there were scenes that would have been great in another version of the story, just not this one. The movie felt like they took three stories and slammed them together to get the final product. Everything felt rushed, even though the movie ran way too long. It was full of cheap ""huh?!"" plot devices. The comedy was anything but comedy (outside of Bruce Cambell's turn as a John Cleese-like french waiter) and was frankly, embarrassing. Spider-Man's much hyped desent into the ""dark side"" was just Peter Parker getting emo hair and not showering, and the normally interesting relationship between Spidey and MJ felt like slow, dull torture.Thomas Hayden Church's performance as the Sandman was great, and he was clearly the most interesting character in the film both visually, and character wise, but he was swallowed up by this monster of a film. By the end, I didn't even see a need for him to be in the story at all. He turned out just to be a plot device to rehash a storyline from the first film that was already settled before Spider-Man 2.And Venom! I had waited 15 years to see Venom, the greatest Spider-Man villain of all time, rendered onto the movie screen. The skinny kid with the big Adam's Apple from ""That 70s Show"" was Venom for maybe only the last 30 minutes of the film, and they didn't even mention he WAS Venom during the movie. Everyone just called him ""that other spider-man!"" after the film. And the continuity was so bad, no one bothered to explain why Topher Grey's character got horrible rat teeth once he became ""that other Spider-Man"". Even Toby's chompers stayed pearly white when he went all emo after wearing the black costume.Fans of the comics will dislike this movie because they basically molested the source material (I.E. the Spider-Man comics this franchise was once so faithful to) to get all these pieces to fit together.Causual fans (I.E. people who only really know about Spidey from the films) will dislike this movie because its just way too much for one film to handle.The only people who'll truly like this movie are CGI junkies. The special effects and the fight scenes are the ONLY arena this film excelled in.Don't waste your money at theaters, unless your a total fan-boy. See it on DVD only if you MUST. Watching it for free on television is what I recommend.What a turkey.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"3","/10","A Poor End to the trilogy","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7647232/?ref_=tt_urv","alindsayal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv","15 December 2021","With less then a week to go to Spider-Man: No Way Home, I have now finished the original trilogy and here is my review for Spider-Man 3. The premise of the film sees Peter Parker coming into contact with an alien symbiote while his life is thrown into turmoil by villains and his complicated love life.Main Character
Tobey Maguire is once again back as Spider-Man and unfortunately this is easily his worst performance in the role. He is fine, as he could play the role in his sleep at this point. It is just Peter is pretty unlikeable in this film and the writing for him is poor. Maguire is only doing what is asked but you can't help but think that he doesn't give as much to this film as he does the others.Supporting Characters
Probably the best character in the film is Flint Marko/Sandman played by Thomas Haden Church. He isn't just an average bad guy, he has interesting and has compelling motivations that if in a better film could have been explored to a greater length. JK Simmons is once again back J. Jonah Jameson and he is great in his small role here, again I kind of wish he could have been on screen more but he is always entertaining to watch. Kirsten Dunst is back as Mary Jane Watson and this is the film where I couldn't stand her, she is just really unlikeable and the plot tries to make you care but you just really won't. The film focuses way too much on her and her own story and it just doesn't work and she comes across poorly. The same could be said of James Franco as Harry Osborne, he was set up really well in the previous film but he is really wasted here and it just feels like he was an afterthought which is disappointing. Topher Grace plays Eddie Brock/Venom and he is just bad, I think the actor has even admitted he isn't good in this film, he was just horribly miscast in the role. It doesn't help that he is barely given anything to do and feels really tacked onto the story here.Story
The film is all over the place in terms of its storytelling. It tries to focus on so much that it ends up failing on the majority of its fronts. You have three villains that are fighting for screen time, romance and action, it has been reported for years that the studio forced Venom into the film and it really shows with this mess of a movie.Script
The script also isn't good. The drama isn't there, it comes across as cringe and weak. The charm worked in the previous films to a certain extent but it fails here. The humour isn't there either and really turns the characters into idiots and kind of ruins them from the previous films.Style
The action scenes are pretty decent, in particular the Spider-Man vs Sandman subway fight. The Black Suit Spider-Man looks great and the CGI is pretty effective for a film that came out a long time ago. But the film is paced really badly, again as I complained about earlier, there are too many plot threads to focus on and it messes up with the pacing and tone of the film.Overall
Overall, Spider-Man 3 is a poor film. It is a big let down to finish the trilogy and its one that all involved would like to forget.Rating - 3/10.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

They should have stuck to 2 spidey films and not bothered with the 3rd.The 'love' scenes, the 'personal dilemma' scenes and the long slow pan and zoom shot scenes didn't captivate the kids from what I could tell - my t-shirt being full of popcorn down my back by the end of it suggested that this film couldn't hold their attention - and I wasn't seeing the film in a chavvy part of London, it was upmarket Clapham. Worrying.There were bits where they attempted comedy - something I recommend that Tobey M never attempts again! Kirsten Dunst didn't really seem to care that she was in this film (and her interview on Jonathon Ross confirms this). Worth seeing for Tophey Grace's performance and the sandman actor chap (although his character story is suspect). Seriously - If you've got kids take them to a shorter film - they will get bored in this and start fidgeting far too much.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

However, some of the special effects and acting are rather overblown, especially the scenes where Peter Parker, wearing the black Spidey suit, struts John Travolta-like down the street, occasionally stopping to do the hustle. The special effects used to create Sandman are also a bit much.To me, a better plot would have to be Peter asking Mary Jane to marry him at the beginning of the movie. Of course, the wedding can't go ahead until he takes care of all the villains, including himself when he's wearing the black suit.The casting of the villains is perfect. Topher Grace certainly isn't the wet noodle character he used to be on ""That 70s Show"". Here he exhibits a lot of intensity.

I may be wrong about Wat i am saying i am not that informed about it, and if i am wrong correct me but judging from Raimi's work on previous movies it makes me sincerely doubt and wonder.This movie has extremely cheesy scenes (extra cheesy really), and very fast pacing in telling incomplete mini plots introducing the characters. Something he took some time in previous movies. Sincerely with that plot and scenes it would suck if it wasn't Raimi directing. I can sincerely say from my opinion that Raimi saved this movie.I just wish Raimi had made this in two movies instead of one and took some time telling some compelling stories like in previous movies,just because venom was my favorite villain, he was the dark side of spider man,like an equal who took a different path,like obi wan and Darth Vader, the two sides of a story.And one more thing my ""review"" is plot-wise, i am analyzing the plot, the time frame of the sequences,the credibility witch Raimi tried to strengthen in the previous movies and the comparison of the characters from the movie with the comic characters in terms of substance.I still recommend it, but if you know the characters and found the previous movies good or acceptable don't keep your expectations too high.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I had high expectations for this movie as I am a huge fan and saw that the preview voter ratings at IMDb were at 8.4. I was tempted to see it at the initial general showing last Thursday at midnight. I'm glad I didn't. The ratings plummeted within a few days and as of today were at 6.8. They probably shouldn't even be that high. The film has spectacular special effects that go to the next level of technical development in much the same way that X-Men progressed from film to film. But that isn't enough to carry the whole project through nearly 2 1/2 hours of viewing time. I was disappointed with the screenplay, dialog and especially the direction and evolution of the character development. I found myself antsy in my seat and glancing at my watch between battle scenes. Early on, an alien meteorite just HAPPENS to strike the earth exactly where Pete and Mary Jane are ""pitching woo"" in a spidey hammock and beyond THAT coincidence, they don't even take notice !? Who developed the Green Goblin's improved transport vehicle and new mask ? I thought I remembered that James Franco's character just barely graduated from High School. If it was him then he must be some kind of repressed super-genius. Tobey Maguire does a laughable morph when he's symbiotisized by the black goo and becomes a low budget Tony Manero, strutting about with an Adolph Hitler hair-do. I half expected to hear the Bee Gees start to sing ""Staying Alive"" in the background. PUH-LEEZE ! These are just small examples of the stupidity woven throughout this VERY poorly developed movie. Danny Elfman's scoring is adequate, but he's no John Williams. J.K. Simmons is amusing but underutilized as the editor of the newspaper; James Cromwell's formidable talents are completely wasted.......... too bad.......remember how disappointing ""Alien 3"" was ?.......Maybe Spiderman 4 will be better............","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

For the most part, I'll agree with what is written. So, after I read most of the reviews here, I was expecting a 'cheesy' movie without much plot... Nothing further from the truth in actuality!Spidey fights 4 bad guys (if you include his own inner demons) and everything ties up at the end in good comic book fashion. The sub-plots help the movie along and I didn't see any extra characters that had no point in the movie. The Sandman was the most underutilized of characters, but with a movie 140 minutes long, someone has to be cut, or we'd have a 180 minute movie!!! All in all, I enjoyed it very much and I always use my wife as the movie barometer... if she snoozes then the movie is at best so-so; if she stays awake, then you have an exciting and entertaining flick. She slept through the first two Spiderman movies and was wide awake through number 3! That says it all from my point of view!","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Im not a fan of any of the spidey films but this is just a really crap attempt at a film. the only bonus to watching this film to me was that there was a disturbance during the film and they gave us a free ticket(but i sneakily got 2 free tickets) to come again another day. so lets all thank the salford scum who disturb the movie for saving what was an otherwise awful evening. Check out the reporter near the end of the movie, deffo never had an acting lesson in her life and the guy on the surf board can only contribute very cheesy acting. An altogether suicidal movie. Can only be compared to Revolver for wanting me to commit suicide rather than reach the end of the film.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

He looks as amateur of an actor as anyone could be. During emotional scenes he does not sell the emotion necessary at all. The facial expressions made by McGuire during the film are extremely cringe and hard to see past. I also want to address the fact that the saturation in all 3 films is overwhelming to say the least. The post production team should be disappointed in this work. The scene where Peter took Gwen to the Jazz Club was absolutely horrendous. The directing staff and post production team all thought that scene was watchable. This trilogy was the hardest series of films I have ever had to watch. If it wasn't for the cross over in the new Spider-Man movie I would have never watched these films and my life would've been better off.

But trust me, this movie isn't what you think it is. I loved the first Spider-Man movie. I tell people that it took me on the whole emotional journey: I laughed, I cried, and I had more fun that I did during any other super hero movie. And then I enjoyed the second Spider-Man movie.But there were those rumors that Sam Raimi, Tobey Maguire, and Kirsten Dunst all wanted out of the franchise. And there were those rumors that the producers wanted to do more, with or without them. About halfway through ""Spider-Man 3"", I got the distinct impression that writer/director Raimi and star Maguire were intentionally trying to sabotage the franchise, brilliantly screwing the studio heads begging for more sequels and, consequentially, the audience as well.The movie starts out promisingly enough, as an excellent character drama in the spirit of the first two movies. Like the first two, the movie puts the emphasis squarely on the character of Peter Parker and his relationship with those around him, specifically beautiful redhead Mary Jane and ""New Goblin"" James Franco, as well as Eddie Brach Gwen Stacey, Aunt May, Sandman, J. Jonah Jameson, Captain Stacey, and too many others for the director to keep track of, even if he wanted to, which Raimi certainly doesn't seem to. Then there's the sloppy handling of the introduction of the symbiote that will eventually create Venom. And there's also the annoying continuity error of Eddie Brach, already mentioned as being a photographer for the Daily Bugle in a previous movie, coming to the Bugle for the first time in search of a job.Despite a few excellent action sequences, the character drama soon devolves into an overly long soap opera filled with love triangle upon triangle and other contrived interactions between the characters. The movie then devolves further into a B-list monster movie. Along the way, it mixes in song-and-dance numbers, extremely awkward and sometimes laughable moments, forced humor, and cliché lines from cheesy buddy cops movies. And the whole time the dialog and situations become more and more cringe-worthy, to the point it seems certain that Raimi and Maguire were trying to make the worst movie possible in order to guarantee there wouldn't be a ""Spider-Man 4."" The movie climaxes in a series of sickly sweet, over-the-top, sappy ""moral of the story"" scenes.Kirsten Dunst at least seems to not be trying to destroy the movie, turning in one of the film's better performances. Nor does Christopher Young, who takes over scoring duties from Danny Elfman, who also wanted desperately out of the franchise. The special effects people also seem to still be trying to turn in their best work, doing incredible jobs of bringing Sandman and Venom to life, even though the movie's major showdown involving the two villains seems like something out of a cheap Godzilla or King Kong movie. And Bruce Campbell's brief cameo appearance provided the only genuinely successful humor in the movie. Bryce Dallas Howard is kinda cute as Gwen Stacey but seems somehow unnatural. Meanwhile, Topher Grace as Eddie Brach/Venom seems to be playing a more contemporary version of his character from ""That 70's Show"" while Tobey Maguire, who did an amazing job portraying Peter Parker in the first two movies, mugs so much that he, once again, seems intent on sabotaging the franchise.The only other people involved with the film who did a decent job were the advertisers. By placing elements of all the best scenes into every trailer, they raised my expectations for ""Spider-Man 3."" I haven't been this disappointed by a movie in a long time.Believe me, I really wanted to like this movie, and I'm sure you really want to like it, too. But don't waste your money and time.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"9","/10","The best of the three?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2448051/?ref_=tt_urv","Wuchakk","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4409266/?ref_=tt_urv","23 June 2011","I think so. 2007's ""Spider-Man 3"" is easily the most entertaining of Sam Raimi's three Spider-Man flicks. The first one (2002) was very good but bogged down by the hero's origin story, which becomes uninteresting on repeat viewings; I also wasn't too crazy about the Goblin's helmet (a minor cavil); the second one (2004) featured a great villain, Dr. Octopus, but was horribly marred by two absurd subplots: one that revealed how Peter's spider powers are somehow linked to his confidence level (Huh? I thought he attained his powers through a radioactive spider) and the other concerned Peter revealing his secret identity to a random group of New Yorkers on the subway with the conclusion that they'll keep his identity secret because they're so thankful for his crimefighting heroics -- Why sure! This third installment takes the good elements of the first two films, minus the origin tale & stoo-pid subplots, and goes into total overdrive. What we end up with is easily one of the most entertaining superhero flicks ever made, not to mention it possesses a wealth of spiritual insights, which is a mark of all great films. Some complain that there are too many villains -- the second Green Goblin, the Sandman and Venom -- but weren't the various Green Goblins (or Hobgoblin) and the Osborns always hovering close by Peter/Spidey to some degree in the comics? As for the Sandman, there wasn't enough depth to him to qualify as the sole villain in a feature film blockbuster; hence, the addition of the parasitic alien that becomes Spider-Man's costume for a brief time and, later, possessing Eddie Brock and becoming Venom. On the surface it appears like there would be too much going on and the film would fall prey to overkill, but Raimi is a master filmmaker by this point and somehow makes it all gel. The 2 hours and 20 minute runtime was necessary for this success. Yes, there are a couple of jarring shifts here and there, but wasn't that the way it was in the comics? One minute Peter's involved in some type of drama and a few frames later Spider-Man's saving the city from the latest nutjob in a costume. Like I said, the film delivers on an entertainment level with loads of action, laughs and melodrama. For instance, when Pete gives into the pull of the alien parasite and becomes the Dark Peter it's hilarious and fun. The film would have been effective with just this, but what propels it into the realm of greatness is the depth of the characters and the numerous potent insights into the human condition: You wouldn't think such potent themes would be effectively addressed in a mere superhero flick, but you'd be wrong. What made Marvel Comics head and shoulders above all other comic brands was not only their creative characters & action, but their maturity and intriguing explorations of morality and the human condition. Even as a 10 year-old boy I was able to clearly see this greatness in Marvel as opposed to other brands (don't get me wrong, other companies had some good stuff as well, it's just that Marvel was in a league of their own). On top of all this you get Gwen Stacy and Captain Stacy! For Gwen they needed someone with a winsome innocence and a babelicious hotness and Bryce Dallas Howard is a pretty good fit. My only gripe is the constant unmasking of Spider-Man, the Goblin and Venom for the obvious purpose of seeing the actor's faces when they speak. This was annoying and unnecessary. CONCLUSION: ""Spider-Man 3"" is easily the best of Sam Raimi's three Spider-Man flicks -- it's the most entertaining and it has the most spiritual depth. It ranks with the top superhero films of all time. GRADE: A","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

A huge disappointment following the fantastic Spider-Man 2. This sequel had a checkered production with a lot of studio interference so I'll cut Sam Raimi some slack. However, I'm not sure his original idea for the movie would have been much better. There's way too much camp and comedy in this. Also, as is so sadly common with superhero movie sequels, they felt the need to tack on more new characters and villains. Like more villains really helped the '90s Batman franchise. Just stupid backwards corporate focus group logic.Anyway, there isn't a positively memorable scene, line, or performance in this film. The only parts people remember are terrible, such as wall-eyed Topher Grace's embarrassing Venom. Thomas Haden Church is actually decent as Sandman, although the way he is shoehorned into the events of the first movie is insulting and offensive to me as a Spider-Man fan. Kirsten Dunst, who I've defended many times from her critics, is awful here. For some reason now, Mary Jane's not just an actress but a singer. Whatever. James Franco looks like he's ready for the movie to be over the whole time. Tobey Maguire is having a field day with the campy scenes he gets and I couldn't hate him more for it. I'm really disgusted with this movie. The direction is half-hearted, the script a mess, and the effects spotty. Sandman effects are okay but the Venom stuff is dreadful. Watch this only if you want to complete the series but be prepared for the worst.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The first summer blockbuster has been released, and it has broken six box office records. And rightly so, ""Spider-Man 3"" is easily the most entertaining, if not the best of trilogy. It is darker, more action-packed, and funnier than either of the first two. Though I thought it was the best, I still have way more quibbles with this one than the first two Spidey's combined. I will get to that later, but first, I will gush about it. First off, there isn't just one villain, or even two, there are four villains in ""Spider-Man 3"". Some may say it's overwhelming, I say it was flippin' awesome. In the last battle sequence, Spider-Man battles all of them in one of the coolest super-hero fight scenes ever made, a major geek-out for fans. And the actors who play the villains are equally great. Thomas Haden Church as the Sandman does very well, though sometimes his performance seems a bit stiff and forced. Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom was perfectly cast; he does brilliantly as a cocky reporter, then amazingly creepy as Venom. I will also say this, the way director Sam Raimi portrayed Venom was right on, since he is my favorite villain, I would know. He will definitely send chills down your spine. James Franco returns as the New Goblin/Harry Osborn and does very well as a comic relief for some of the film, and a troubled, downright evil villain the rest of it. All the other original cast members are back, with Tobey Maguire doing spectacular showing a darker side of Spider-Man. And once you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about. Kirsten Dunst is nothing special, in two scenes she sings and it is the worst lip synching I've ever seen. There is no expression in her eyes, most of the time she seems wooden. Of course J.K. Simmons as Peter Parker's boss, J. Jonah Jameson, is hilarious as always. A new addition to the cast, one I really enjoyed, was Bryce Dallas Howard as Peter's new love interest, Gwen Stacy. One addition I didn't enjoy was a random butler for Harry Osborn, who just popped out of nowhere, like he'd been there all along. OK, now to get down to the nitty gritty.The CG was absolutely spectacular. A reported 258 million dollars was spent on this film, a record high for a movie, which means, great CG. The score was not as great as the other two, since Danny Elfman opted to do ""Charlotte's Web"" instead. The music did its job though, and moved the film along. My major nitpick for this film is the scriptwriting. One too many scenes felt like a soap opera as almost every character cried at least once. Another problem was the corny dialogue, which never was a problem in the first two ""Spider-Man's"". It's one of those things where you sit there and think, ""Just give me a pen and paper, and I'll write that scene a million times better, please!"" The runtime is another minor quibble, the film clocks in at 150 minutes, the longest ""Spider-Man"" yet. Still, as I said before, it is such an entertaining film. You will laugh, cry, jump out of your seat, and all that fun stuff that always accompany blockbusters. So just be prepared to have a good time, and not expect some deep, emotionally moving, thought-provoking film, because you'd be sorely disappointed. You will have fun, I guarantee it.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Even though they are more common and their plots are often similar with no unique qualities, the Spiderman trilogy has not only been action-packed, but also has an in-depth plot behind it.I admired the fact that the film had so many circumstances or situations that were identifiable for any individual. That just like anyone else, Peter Parker (a.k.a. Spiderman) had to face his own inner demons as well as the conflicting issues he had with many others such as his true love, Mary Jane Watson and his best friend, Harry Osborne.Their's not much more I can say, because I don't want to reveal any key plots, but I encourage anyone to watch this film and enjoy it, for it was awesome, heroic cinema.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

The action scenes were very good - albeit a LOT of CG that looked obviously so. The plot was all over the place, and character development was almost non-existent. In a lot of ways, the film reminded me of ""X-Men 3"" - very rushed, with a storyline that jumped between the multiple plot points way too much.The CG effects of Sandman were hit and miss IMO. In some cases - it looked really good - and others not so much. Venom was majorly underused and when he was he looked a lot like that dog Milo from ""The Mask"" when he sticks the mask on - overexaggerated fangs, and lacking the protruding jaw from the comics - just something didn't look right with him. Add to that the fact that even when in full on fangs and white eyes mode - Venom still speaks with Topher's voice - no effect has been added to it at all - which quite honestly looked really off! In some cases it looked like pre-viz work almost. I knew it would be hard to pull of Venom - but with today's state of the art - I was expecting something different.Acting-wise - well - this is a comic book film, so I'm not looking for next year's potential Best Actor or Actress nominees here...When Peter goes evil mode with the black suit, the scenes are almost too much. I'm not sure what effect Raimi was looking to convey here, but I found much of the time he was just acting plain stupid. Spidey's fights while clad in black are much more brutal - with him not afraid to go beyond what is necessary in the battle - even to the extent of playing dirty. I've long stood by the theory that Dunst can't act and she once again proves it with a 2-dimensional run at MJ. Church, as Sandman, was a throwaway character. They gave him nothing to do except be a stand in for the CG department. Topher as Brock/Venom really didn't have ample time to create anything of a character - another drawback from the loopy storyline. James Franco sways between acting like Willem Dafoe - right down to the squinting left eye thing - to Degrassi mode when he has amnesia. Like I said - I'm not expecting awards here unless they're Razzies.The big huge battle royale has its moments of pure wow factor, offset by Venom's comical appearance. For most of the fight, Topher has the face pulled away, but you do get 4 or 5 really good looks at him in full on symbiote mode. Without ruining anything, the ending was a bit of a let-down.The Stan Lee cameo was a nice touch, and Campbell as the French waiter was funny, but the spidey sense line was right up there with the ""Holy rusted metal"" schtick. Again, stuff like that really detracted from the film IMO.All in all, I suppose it's a film worth seeing - but if you go in there thinking this is the superhero film to top the likes of ""Batman Begins"" or the second Spider-Man, you might be disappointed. Worth the price of admission at a matinée, and I look forward to the DVD in November in hopes of some deleted material to fill in some of the gaps and make some sense of the multitude of story arcs.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A grand finale that sets the bar for future comic book films to come","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1648803/?ref_=tt_urv","DonFishies","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1622466/?ref_=tt_urv","4 May 2007","Despite never really being into comics, I knew the Spider-Man mythos, and watched the animated FOX series religiously. When the first movie came out, I was underwhelmed, but thoroughly enjoyed the second. As the hype machine built up for his third outing, I had my usual skepticism, and really did not want to set myself up for disappointment. And thankfully, the film did not disappoint as much as I was lead to believe in the days leading up to it.The rumours are true. There is a hell of a lot going on in Spider-Man 3. So much so, that a quick synopsis will not do it justice. But in essence, much like the first two films, the third film is about Peter Parker's (Tobey Maguire) struggle to juggle his personal life, his love life with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and his life as Spider-Man. Thrown into the mix this time are two villains: Flint Marko aka Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), an ex-con looking for the money to save his ailing daughter, and Eddie Brock aka Venom (Topher Grace), a rival photographer just looking to move up the ladder.And of course, they also have Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), Peter's scheming friend Harry (James Franco) and another female love interest, Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard).While it is heavy on plot and even heavier on story, it is held together fairly well. Despite clocking in at one-hundred and forty minutes, the majority of the film moves at break-neck speeds, rarely slowing down at all. There is a lot of emphasis on Peter, and his slow brooding ego-centrism, but there was a surprising amount of material for the supporting characters too. Franco's character is really well shown, and his motivations are felt throughout. His scheming tendencies are put to good use finally (and not just nudged at like in the previous film), and really helps to flesh out his character. Much the same can be said for Dunst, who is probably the most evolved of any of the characters. Church and Grace's story lines are done fairly well, although I wish they both had a bit more material to help flesh them out even further. Howard's character, while being a bit of an anomaly for comic fans, is not too bad, but she sadly is the most underwritten of anyone in the main cast.If anything can be said against the story, it is that they play up Peter's ego a bit too much. I understand that it is the central core to the film, but some of his most ego-centric scenes are played off more so for laughs than anything. I liked them, but they could have done with a lot more dramatic flair.The same goes for the dialogue. I laughed a lot, and I enjoyed his smart-ass quips, but when the real emotionally wrenching stuff comes, I still felt a bit of an urge to laugh. It is very true to the language of a comic, but it could have done with a bit of beefing up with how serious it had to be. Some of these sequences are downright heartbreaking, and having the characters just rhyme off comic book dialogue can only go so far for so long. I will say though, it did not help that I had a running commentary going on behind me, making a joke out of just about anything dramatic the characters were saying. But if it was that easy for them, then clearly something needed to be fixed.But even with saying that, the acting is not ruined. It actually is the strongest of the series. Maguire is at his absolute best, playing the conflicted web-slinger. Even the slightest touch of evil from him feels magnificent. If anyone was not convinced before that this was the best choice for Peter Parker, they will after seeing this movie. Dunst and Franco are both excellent, and bring a lot of previously unseen maturity to the franchise. They work wonderfully against Maguire. Church is great as always, and Grace is pitch-perfect. I was absolutely awestruck by just how good his performance was. Smaller roles from series regulars like Harris, J.K. Simmons, Elizabeth Banks, Dylan Baker and Ted Raimi are all done with just the right amount of finesse, and cameos from Stan Lee and Bruce Campbell are more than applause-worthy.Thankfully, the film does not skimp out on the action, or the special effects. With a mostly fast-paced runtime, the film weaves itself in and out of impressive action sequences that slowly become greater in both the stakes at hand, and the intensity of the scene. And even the smallest fight scene tops anything done in the previous two films. They are choreographed wonderfully, and are captured even better. The effects are really in high gear here, and never is a scene left looking too choppy or fake. Even the most ridiculous of sequences has great CGI. They are outstanding in every sense of the word, and are not easily going to be topped. The transformation of Sandman is a particular standout, as Church is blended beautifully into the sand in one fluid motion, leaving the audience wondering if the scene was actually real or not. It is unbelievably well done, and is one of the key highlights of the film.Spider-Man 3 was an ambitious project that could have been a complete disaster. But thankfully, despite a few blemishes, the film delivers and sets the bar for future comic book films to come. The acting is top-notch, and the effects are above and beyond superb. If this is how the summer of 2007 is going to begin, I can only hope that the rest of the films coming can live up to this one.8.5/10.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Too much melodrama but didn't deliver on a tight story and character development.It lacked focus, so many villains but none came out interesting. We have Sandman who has a boring backstory and his motivation lacks depth. Then there's Venom who I understand is supposed to be the arch-nemesis of Spiderman, but makes his entrance too late in the movie and was given too little screen time. And easily dispatched too, what a waste. Then the new Green Goblin, Harry Osbourne, is not central to the story and was put aside for most of the movie due to amnesia, only to be entangled with Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson's lovelife. That lovelife bit btw turn out to be very dragging, they really overdo it this time.""The greatest battle lies within"", says the poster. I'm really interested on what it is about but Peter's dark side turns out to be emo, funny for a while but not what I'm expecting.The script really tries to narrate so many threads, resulting on some very lame deus ex machina. One example is the butler who just decided to tell Harry, after all this time, what really happened during his father's death.The film turns up some good special effects. Watched this is in IMAX, too bad it's in 2D, but I say the fight scenes are more kinetic than the previous two. Still, I've seen nothing new and the scenes are really forgettable.A mediocre superhero movie, a pity since the first two are well done. I don't think I'm inclined to watch this again.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Like with Venom taking him over and Peter expressing his pain to all the people that have picked on him instead of Peter been the good, polite and generous hero Spider-Man. That's what I liked about this movie. We see Peter Parker as a brand new dark character. Sandman was pretty good. There was a huge secret about him killing Uncle Ben right at the end, but I wont spoil it. Harry as The Green Goblin was a good idea, if not predictable to see coming after watching the second one. Harry loses his memory after he tries to kill Parker, but it slowly grows back to what he has to do...KILL SPIDER-MAN. Venom was excellent. Only problem was he came in just after 100 mins of the movie. He's my favorite villain. I wanted to see more of him. But Venom was powerful, quick and awesome. He's in it in the last 20 mins. From 100-120 ins you'll see him on screen. But a pretty good movie...but the whole love affair between Peter and Mary Jane needs to be stopped and over with. It's getting too much.

Simmons, Bryce Dallas Howard, Dylan Baker, Bill Nunn, James Cromwell, Bruce Campbell, Cliff Robertson. Directed by Sam Raimi.Possible spoilers.Terribly disappointing sequel that had been highly anticipating since the release of the impressive ""Spider-Man 2"" in 2004. Peter Parker's life is going well in New York City. He's the on top of his classes in College and he is also still in a strong relationship with his high school sweetheart Mary Jane Watson. His former best friend, Harry Osborn, still holds a grudge against Peter about being revealed of who his father's real ""murderer"" was. Following in his father's footsteps, Harry has now become the New Goblin and will stop at nothing to kill Spider-Man. This time, Spider-Man must also deal with two more villains, one of which coincidentally is responsible for his Uncle's death (Sandman) and the other who is a photographer also working for the Daily Bugle (Venom). The meanest villain of all is one that isn't even human - the black symboite that takes Peter's costume over and leaves him in a change of personality that he must fight. So much expectation from many fans of the series thinking it would be the strongest part of the series like ""Return of the King"" was for ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Revenge of the Sith"" was for the new Star Wars trilogy. Problems with the storyline and characters are really what makes the film go down. Everything seems so rushed and sloppy compared to the first two films. Maguire's performance is less than impressive, as all he seems to do on the screen is either to act like a jerk or cry over Mary Jane. James Franco is really the only performance I actually enjoyed, but even he can't make up for all of the other performers. Sam Raimi must really have a tough time thinking of new ideas for the film because we still have the same sub-story lines regarding Uncle Ben's death or Peter and Mary Jane's on-and-off relationship. The second film was fresh because there was a completely different villain and Peter's personality was very understanding for him not wanting to be Spider-Man in order to live an every day life. Here, watching Peter is about as likable as hanging out with Rush Limbaugh for a day. The ""dancing"" scenes are especially stupid, and his ""new look"" is just painful to look at. That being said, the special effects are at least decent and there are a few funny scenes and enjoyable action sequences. Overall, I just think that it could have been a great film had the director put in the effort to develop it. In the end it just looks like he wrapped it up like a teenager working on a high school book report at the last minute.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

In all the best way to describe this without spoilers is a movie that didnt know what it wanted to be and ended up a mess.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It has some great deal of actions and at the same time, it touches our hearts. The story followed Peter parker, spider-man, having some serious problems, he wanted to propose to Mary jane, his girlfriend but something got him and he did not propose, meantime, harry remembered his father's death and decided to take over his father and became the new goblin to kill Peter, not only that, sandman was also running away from the police which ended up that Peter knew him plus a freelancer, Eddie brock was out to get the job and ruined Peter's life and getting the job. Soon there was a blackish goo rise from outer space and needed a home so it mixed with Peter and transformed him into a new person, the bad and the cool side of him. There are so many things happening in a time. The fighting scenes are not so bad, more brutal than the last spider-man movies, the last fight scene is the best, you will get to see peter and harry teaming up together in order to fight with sandman and venom. You will get to see the long-awaited villain, venom which is cool but happened to appear in the last part of the movie only, only if the director had extended the last battle, it would have been good.The story is good, the CG effects are cool, (it seemed that the director was well-trained) this movie is a must-watch movie for spider-man's fans but newcomers may be good with it. It is not like any action movies, it has the story for you to keep on.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Very gauche,and just barely worth the price of admission.The highlight for me was the waiter in the restaurant.

This is what the whole cinema felt like last night. It was an exhausting experience which felt like it was never going to end. The film spends so much time on character development but fails because of the vast amount of characters, thus half of the film is wasted. Apparently the cast were recalled earlier this year to add more action scenes, yet there were still few and far between. It's big year of blockbusters this year which relies heavily on third installments, so far Terminator 3 and The Matrix Revolutions spring to mind rather than Return of The King or Revenge of The Sith.

On the whole, it's a very engrossing, albeit complex story. Yes, the special effects and physical conflict scenes are terrific, but there's a good deal of humor, drama, interpersonal struggle, romance, and a commitment to principles peppered throughout. One of the best features of Spiderman 3 is its complex presentation of heroism--of sacrifice with regret, courage with fear, confrontation with cost, and of redemption after mistaken judgment. Spiderman is a hero not because of what he is but what he chooses to be, and he repeatedly discovers that being a hero is choosing to be decent when it would be more appealing to be simply powerful, popular, or selfish. Much of this is developed without special effects, in ordinary interactions among the characters. Critics of the movie seemed to want Peter Parker to be darker in his moments of failure. But Parker's awkwardness in trying to be ""cool"" is a great satire of the brooding adolescent. At first I thought it weak that Spiderman's two challengers never fully cooperated against their enemy, but even this seemed a useful contrast with the quality of Spidey's friendships. Yes, it takes a bit of mental work to make sense of several villains various motives and special abilities, but isn't that life? I'm surprised the critics couldn't keep up.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

This obviously stretched out movie could have done without some of the quirkiness that Tobey Maquire brings. He already has a nerd quality being himself. It was so over the top and took away from the story line. If the director/producer's intent was to merely entertain and not to tell a great story then they accomplished their goal. The Spider-man trilogy ends on a very un-climatic bang or should I say whimper. I hope they don't end this franchise this way. I don't want to have to wait 10 years for a resurrection like the Batman franchise. The writer's should have explored Spider-man's dark side as the new Batman franchise did. It's all in the actor's face sometimes. Tobey Maquire doesn't have the same flare as Christian Bale. To compensate, Spider-man needs more action and high flying swinging. And lastly, leave music to musicals.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The themes of sacrifice, friendship, love and choice are all there as in the previous 2. However the value of forgiveness is a new one that shines through as the beating heart of the film. As well as what the posters and trailers suggest, ""the greatest battle lies within"".. No matter how hard things get we can choose to be on the right side of the war inside... Very inspiring stuff and it was actually these themes that for me lifted this film above the first two.Mcguire shows his comedic side in this film and man, he's a funny guy. A lot of people seem to have a problem with Kirsten Dunst but I've always thought she's been great in the part and I thought she was again. Franco I think has the best part in the film. I wont spoil it for you but his performance is really terrific. The character development of the three main characters is all full. Church played Sandman really well, you felt for him. Topher Grace was good fun.Sam Raimi is clearly a master of mixing comedy with action and drama and this movie is the quintessential bench mark of that. He's done a terrific job. My only reservation about this film is that Sandman's birth wasn't really explained much. Although perhaps thats because it's so far fetched it relies on us knowing so little to buy it. Although in the world of spider-man this can be forgiven.Unless you've got a really good script Sony, don't make another one because this ends the story on a high. Though I do want to see Connors turn bad....","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The number 2, one of the best superhero films of ALL TIME. Then this one, a horribly written film that jumps all over the place more than any film has ever. What was Sam Raimi thinking? People we're dying to see Venom, they couldn't wait to see him, I personally was waiting before the first film was made. This is the villain people want to see more than any other. And this is what we get? Venom is on screen for twenty minutes, and it's played by... whatever his name is which doesn't cross my mind because of his poor performance as the villain. This was supposed to be the best of them all, the grandest, and needless to say, it is the worst. Seriously, a HORRIBLE HORRIBLE FILM. There are too many irrelevant scenes to even count, decent action, good acting only by Toby Maguire and Thomas Haden Church. And by the way, what the hell was that thing that he fell in before he turned into Sandman? We're they experimenting with sand castles? There is no explanation to anything at all in the film to what the hell that was, what and where the meteor came from, there are just too many villains. All I can say now is that they messed up. They messed up big time. This was supposed to be the film that everyone wanted to see because of Venom, HE'S ONLY ON SCREEN FOR TWENTY MINUTES!!!!!!!! THE REASON FOR THAT IS Because Peter Parker, Mary Jane, Harry, Aunt May, and Gwen Stacy all take turns crying in the film, this is the biggest crying fest I have ever seen on film. Every second, someone crys. This is about the relationship more than dealing with the Villain. Peter would rather cry than save people. I honestly thought this film was horrific to watch, and some scenes in the film I couldn't believe we're filmed. Save your money, this film wasn't worth me going to see it Thursday night, at midnight mind you, watching people cry for 2 hours and Venom for fifteen, getting out of the movie theater, and getting home at 3:30 am. Sam Raimi has destroyed this film, blame him.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

To begin with, I am only based on the animated series of the 90s and this film, like its predecessors, respects the vision of said series. Tobey is still the best of the entire saga. Harry gets more relevance here as Peter and Mary Jane. The new villain Sandman is quite dramatizable, as his motives for being a villain have an understandable reason, which makes one feel sorry for him. Finally, Venom appears here for the first time, whose design is not like that of the comics or the animated series, but has its essence when he sees how he corrupts Peter in his black suit form, causing Peter to be consumed by anger. Another point to note is that it gives some closure to Peter's story arc regarding the death of Uncle Ben. Instead of Danny Elfman, Christopher Young is doing the soundtrack, but his music is passable. The action scenes and special effects do not disappoint. The ending was soft giving the trilogy a soap opera ending, but the rest of the film fulfills its objective. My rating for this movie is a 10/10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Spider-Man the comic book has been on going for, what, 40 years? Yet Hollywood insists on trying to cram 5 years of story into 2+ hours. With that off my chest let me say that it's obvious that Sam Raimi loves Spider Many and tries to make a good script, but there is just too much involved to do it justice. What there is has problems, mostly plot holes. One of the biggest is one of my favorite Spidey power, spider sense! It is on the fritz for most of this film. The REASON it is on the fritz is so that the over-the-top battle scenes can take place. Now I know spidey regenerates quickly, but he's not superman! he does cut and bleed and his bones will break...not in this cartoon version. But having Spidey dodge his opponents would not satisfy some know-nothing Hollywood big wig by having enough 'action'. Now for the good. Good dialog, except for the lack of snappy patter during combat that is part of the Spiderman mystique. The love story and relationships, well done. Super effects, solid acting & direction. It gets a 7 from me, simply for being entertaining, and I was entertained, when I wasn't noticing problems.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I recently saw Spider-Man 3, and I must admit it's a solid, interesting and entertaining film, but, like I said before, this film is unable to reach the greatness of third installments or chapters such as RETURN OF THE JEDI, REVENGE OF THE SITH, INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE and RETURN OF THE KING. The positive elements of the movie are the amazing action sequences and the interesting human dynamics, which were kept from the previous movie, this is the department where Spidey 3 really pays off. Unfortunately Spidey 3 is flawed in many ways, one of which was trying to fit too much into the film, which is a common flaw in many third installments (including memorable ones) but here this flaw becomes more evident and hurts the film even more: your attention keeps jumping from one issue to another very quickly, therefore being difficult to understand the storyline coherently, even if you are a Spider-Man die hard fan. All the previously mentioned things make the third chapter of the Spider-Man saga, uneven; its predecessors ,unlike this film, had a more stable and coherent storyline. Now lets talk about the story itself, here is where I find a major flaw: Uncle Ben's death. The death of Uncle Ben was a very important, canonical and pivotal event in the Spider-Man universe, it was Peter's negligence by failing to stop a criminal what caused Uncle Ben's death in the first place; the writers twisted the story by giving Uncle Ben's killer a different name and a different face, therefore tampering with the essence of the Spider-Man mythology; the powerful premise of ""great power and great responsibility"" is deeply hurt with this unwise twist. Second, the arrival of the symbiotic substance, wow, that was pretty lame for a summer blockbuster, the 90's cartoon featured the arrival of the alien suit in a more exciting and dynamic way, here, all we get to see is a falling meteor; the same way science fiction monsters fell from space to earth in B movies such as THE BLOB. Sadly and unfortunately, Spidey does not walk out of this one clean; honor and dignity are nowhere to be seen at the end of the film. It was interesting to notice many similarities to SUPERMAN III: a new girl, the hero becoming evil, a big catastrophe where the hero saves the day (Spidey's crane and Supes chemical plant), unexpected villains, comedy elements and bad taste (Superman getting drunk and Spider-Man hitting MJ). I don't think Spider-Man 3 is the worst of the trilogy, the original movie was a weak by the numbers summer blockbuster, the second one an entertaining and interesting wisely written story, slightly better than the third, and Spider-Man 3 bears a second place medal between the first two movies. When Danny Elfman left the project (SM3) I could smell trouble a mile away, and it seems I was not wrong: the musical score in this film is equally uneven, but I don't think this was a very big production problem when they were making the movie. Well, here you have my review of SPIDER-MAN 3: a good film that could have been better.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I heard things like ""Spider-Man 3 sucks"" or, among critics, ""Third time's a yawn,"" and ""Raimi thinks he can do it all by himself."" I was trying to get my hopes down and not expect much. For reference, I thought the first installment was an okay film with 6/10, and SM2 was really a brilliant movie with 9.5/10. I did not see how it was possible to mess up. The ending of SM2 left such a great plot open. I wasn't expecting much though, after hearing many bad things about the movie.One thing I'd like to clarify, to dispose this notion, is that I'm not a comic fan. I've never read a Spider-Man comic in my entire life. So, please, remember that not everyone who hated this film was a comic fanboy.All right. I go into the theatre. I wait TWO DAMN HOURS since every show until then is flat sold out. I finally get in, and the opening logos come up. The opening credits were phenomenal, I thought we were in the clear. I thought that this movie was going to be an underrated sequel, ala Godfather 3 or Batman Returns. Then...the movie started. The first line in this movie is, ""It's me! Peter Parker, your friendly neighborhood...you know."" As soon as I heard that coupled with the cheesy music, I got a sinking feeling. That sinking feeling never left. I kept watching though, and I heard crap dialogue after crap dialogue spoken by Peter/Spider-Man. Such gems included ""I'm so nervous,"" and ""That's my girlfriend!"" So then Kirsten Dunst playing Mary Jane arrives on-screen, who sings a musical number, yes that's right a song in Spider-Man, and then whines about her atrocious singing. Following is the worst scene transition I have ever seen, then we see a delightfully lame and cheesy fight scene. Amnesia and alien plasma being used as plot points only made me laugh more.To my amazement however, the film kept getting worse. The first villain is introduced, played by Thomas Haden Church, and is developed with a personality and storyline for a whole of two minutes. He is only more unrealistic, and he is supposed to make the audience feel sad for him. It's quite hard to give a damn about the being made out of rocks when you know nothing about him.After this, something(not going to say what for fear of spoilers) that was accepted as fact in the first two movies is just discarded and a new explanation is given and the viewers are supposed to blindly idiotically accept this as fact now. Peter is angry at this thing, and then he turns badass. However, badass in this case suddenly includes a dance scene where we can't see Peter's head who makes a complete moron out of himself. Sam Raimi then expects us to believe this repulsive scene which I honestly thought was a fantasy the whole time.I'll stop describing the movie here, because that would be 'spoiling' this piece of garbage for you. However, you should be warned of the following. There is a super cool villain who is barely shown in the movie, a really boring climax fight, a moronic British female reporter, and BY FAR, the WORST CONCLUSION I have EVER seen on how to handle a villain's 'weakness'.I left the theatre, trying to deny what I just saw. It didn't work, and I'm scarred for life. The entire cast was either baked or freaking tired of these movies when they were on the set because I've seen better acting from my little brother in the 3rd grade rendition of The Ugly Duckling. The dialogue was an abomination, and the crew of this movie pretty much deserves to be shot on sight just because of that. The story lines are cluttered, and character development has become a forgotten concept apparently. The film editing is the worst I have ever seen. I must say I'm ecstatic that it's disappointing in the box office.The Good: A couple jokes that made me laugh, nice art direction, prettiful sets.The BAD: Dialogue, acting, over the top tone, cluttered story lines, out-of-character script, lame effects, zero character development, nothing from the previous two movies, really sh-tty film editing.Overall grade: 1 out of 4 stars D 3 out of 10Recommended: NO","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

What results is a film that finally shows the goofy, corny, yet extremely enjoyable style of director Sam Raimi. Still, the rumors are true, Spider-Man 3 does have too much going on, with about five different story lines tossed around. Raimi does a fairly competent job stringing them all together, but there isn't enough time to actually give some of the characters enough development. However, for all of the film's flaws, there are plenty of strengths.First of all, the film is extremely entertaining to watch, with its nearly two and a half hour running time breezing by. Toby Maguire returns as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, who struggles with issues involving his girlfriend, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Now becoming more of a threat to his life than a personal problem is Peter's former best friend, Harry Osborn (James Franco), and his eagerness to avenge his father's death by donning the Green Goblin mask. Yet another storyline concerns a desolate criminal named Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) who may have been the actual killer of Peter's uncle. Spider-Man also scuffles with a rival photographer named Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) who eventually transforms into a creature known as Venom, and wrestles with his own impending dark side. With so much to keep track of in such a loaded film, characters like Venom and Flint Marko (The Sandman) don't receive enough screen time to really make an impact. Perhaps some story lines could have been saved for future films, in order to develop the more crucial characters. On the other hand, many segments are thoroughly cultivated, with Harry Osborn's relationship with Peter being one of the best handled elements of the film. One sequence of the film causing much polarity amongst audiences is when Spider-Man fully embraces his dark side and his new black spidey suit. Instead of Peter being ruthless and dark, Raimi makes him absurdly pompous. Rather than getting what was advertised as the darkest of the Spider-Man movies, we receive a very fun superhero film with great action sequences and many hysterical moments, including a cameo by the legendary Bruce Campbell (The Evil Dead trilogy) as a French maitre'd. While definitely far from great, Spider-Man 3 has a notable distinction being that in spite of much of the clichéd dialogue and over the top moments, the film still succeeds in what it intends to do, which is to entertain. Raimi was certainly aware of what he was making, packing enough action, comedy, and strong performances to obscure the cringe inducing moments.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Sam Raimi's direction and camera style. The Special effects. Topher Grace as Brock. J.K. Simmons as Jameson. Bruce Campbell's cameo is a script highpoint. Did I mention the special effects? The Mediocre: Venom, interesting design and special effects, but not a developed story arc. What could have been impressive, comes off flat because of the depth. Thomas Haden Church also had little to work with, was as good as the script allowed him to be. James Franco did what he could with the script as well, but his part became so cliché because of the script, it was almost laughable by film's end. James Cromwell is under used.The Bad: The script. Treads into numerous clichéd areas. The villains are underdeveloped, special effects can't carry a C script into an A grade. Too much occurs with too little depth, characters occur shallow or callow at times. Gwen Stacy's parts are so poorly written and conceived, that Bryce Dallas Howard is unable to salvage anything from her screen time. Which is a shame.The Unforgivable: If there is a Spiderman 4, please for the love of all that is unholy, don't bring Kirsten Dunst back.

The series should get another producer/director and go another direction. The film, simply, is trying to do too much. The director should have just stuck with one major villain, like the previous two films, instead of three. That way, the movie would feel less rushed and better developed. Right now, the film has too many angles, themes and story lines to be one coherent story. It is actually frustrating to watch.The most disappointing part of the movie is how under utilized Venom is. For such a major character in the original comic book series and a character with so much potential, his screen time is laughable. I want to see more of him than the last 30 minutes of the film. It is understandable that the director is using the alien symbiote (since it brings out the bad side in people) to create an internal conflict in Peter Parker; however, having Sandman as Uncle Ben's original killer is enough (not so in the comic books). Venom would be better served if he is in Spiderman 4, and be the only villain in the story.The only redeeming quality of the film is the impressive CG (computer graphics) and the last battle scene. That is money well-spent. Everything is smooth and realistic; it feels like a steal to pay only ten to fifteen dollars to witness such marvels in technology. Still, the battle feel a little bit too short. I wish it could have been longer.The plot is only worth a 3 out of 10; however, with the technology, I would bring it up to 5 out of 10. It is an entertaining movie, but not an award winning movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's like a chewing gum that's lost it's flavor but you can still use to blow huge colorful bubbles. Some even applauded at the end.(spoilerish material below) OK, the scene with the Americen flag was cheese but I think it was meant as a joke. I kinda think that most of this movie was meant as a joke. Like the scene were emo Peter dances down the street doing corny gestures at all the girls and getting his groove on after buying some new threads(totally contrasting the geek getup with the little red scooter helmet) is obviously a joke. And the whole Fawlty Towers bit with Bruce Campbell and getting a young comedy actor to play Venom, HILARIOUS. There's even a big part of the movie were Harry Osborn, who is supposed to be one of Spidey's most dangerous enemies, is the comedy relief guy(after being a stiff and mean spirited brat throughout the entire series).

I am one fan who believes that Hollywood is getting lazy by not limiting themselves to to movies that are 1-2 hours long (perferably somewhere in the middle). In result these movies have scenes that are too long and less polished. My fears were correct for Spider-man 3. There were scenes that lingered on for a while. I don't understand why the camera needs to rotate around Peter Parker's face when he is questioning his life. This takes too long. There were a lot of scenes that were necessary in building the story and mood, but there was too much story. Too many villains. Too much stuff going on. A good deal of the audience left the theater before the movie was over.There was also one scene where the police were looking for the sandman, but the camera was so jerky that it was hard for me to focus on what was going on.Hollywood needs to stop making movies over two hours long. At least this should be rare. This should not be the new standard. I understand that some movies have are tightly made that last this long.The final fight scene was good, the peter parker Mary Jane stuff was good.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I couldn't imagine that Raimi would be able to surpass the brilliant Spider-Man 2, but was at least hoping for a decent closure. And I think that Spider-Man 3 is exactly that: a decent closure. The first half of the story is heavy on the soapy side. While Peter Parker is getting all the appreciation as Spider-Man, the career of MJ is really going down. She gets fired from her Broadway play and must go back waitering in a jazz café. This causes a lot of stress in their relationship. The movie really kicks off when Sandman arrives at the scene and when Harry starts making plans to get rid of Peter Parker once and for all. Later on there's Topher Grace as well. Him becoming Venom is a great thing. I just wished there was more screen time for Venom. The Harry - Peter Parker relationship (with MJ in the middle) was what really worked in the film. Showing Peter Parker's dark side was well done, but couldn't they stop him from dancing? You know what I mean when you see the film. Of course, the movie is action packed. But frankly, we've seen fight scenes like these before (in part 1 and 2). They don't surprise us anymore. The final fight between the good guy(s) and bad guys is really cool. You really get that superhero-comic book sense of a greatness. Spider-Man 3 is no masterpiece. It's a very well made movie that only disappoints when you compare it to the previous movies. As a stand alone, it's great entertainment! 8/10","9 out of 36 found this helpful.

In cinemas nationwide, there were long lines literally snaking throughout the floor were the cinemas are located.The movie both delivered and disappointed.It delivered the nitty-gritty action and suspense, drama and comedy that we love in the first two Spider-man movies. It further reaffirms the action hero's iconic status over other superheroes.It disappointed in a sense that the movie focused too much attention to one stage of Peter Parker's personality and his tendency to be too self-absorbed in his importance as a hero. In this aspect, the movie fails to give equal emphasis on the villains. There was little screen time to Venom. The movie could have provided a different level of excitement had Venom been given more screen time like Sandman (because in the cartoons/comics that I had watched/read, Venom is probably the most difficult villain that Spider-man faced, but in the movie, it was rather abridged). This is probably the dilemma with movies faced with two antagonists. Had there been only one, it could have provided more 'soul' to the movie like Spider-man 2 (which I believed is so much better because it focused only on a single antagonist).But this minor flaw was circumvented towards the climax of the movie.

Topher Grace gave life to Venom's character. And to think, Spidey has to fight three villains. I never thought that Venom was to be in this movie. He kicked ass. And Harry Osbourne's glider was pretty cool. There are a lot of surprises in this movie. Like Harry joining forces with Spidey to help battle Venom and Sandman.

This $250 million movie was worth every penny.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Spidey 3 is one of those sort of movie which directors make, when they don't have anything to do, and they are sure irrespective of how much crap they put in the movie, its gonna work in the box office. Same with Spidey 3.Each of its prequels had something to remember by. Spidey 1 had that famous quote, ""With great powers come great responsibilities"" Spidey 2 had that unbelievable train action sequence. Spidey 3 has nothing. Absolutely nothing. I though with 3 villains maybe this franchise is maturing to the level of the batman franchises. Instead it has pummeled down the drain. The only logical thing to remember this sequence by would probably be, th comic relief of Bruce Campbell, and a bad Peter Parker. Kirsten Dunst was awful, no scratch that she was woeful. Topher Grace, I really had high expectations for Venom, but he was shunted to the sidelines which made his character so trivial. Thomas Hayden Church as Sandman/Flint Marko was decent. His animations as the Sandman were the only thing about special effects that were up to the mark. James Franco was probably the only person who was really good in the movie. His expressions even during the fight sequences were good. They should have re christened the movie as Harry 3. LOL !!!Bryce Dallas Howard !!! She looked stunning. I agree with one of the reviewers, she really should stop making those Shaymalan movies,and take up some romantic roles. She is a visual stunner.Everything else was crap. Many are complaining that the movie was too long. Well considering the junk it was, it literally was too too long. But had Raimi elongated the movie to another 20-25 minutes and stretched the individual plots, I feel that would have been a better package.No point harping on the plot, since by this time all of you should have come to know of it. Taking in about the rest of the stuff behind the scenes, well, visual effects were moderately good enough but not quite the standard you expect in a spidey movie. The score was dreadful compared to the previous 2. Screen play pathetic.Simple enough, 4/10 is an overrated vote for me !!!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Spider-Man is back with a new attitude this time!In the first Spider-Man movie it was all about Peter Parker (Maguire) donning the gift of fighting crime without anyone noticing; in Spider-Man 2 (The best of the trilogy), Peter Parker can't seem to balance himself as an ordinary guy making money along with being a crime-fighter for which he loses his powers and his truth is revealed to Mary Jane (Dunst) and Harry (Franco); in this installment Parker shows off to the public and at the same time dons another power: the symbiont for which in the comic book it gave Spider-Man more abilities than he ever imagined along with hurting those people he cares for along the way including Mary Jane.Like any superhero movie comes the villains. In this latest installment we have Flint Marko/The Sandman played with sympathy by Thomas Hayden Church after making an escape from prison to get money for his ailing daughter (Perla-Haney Jardine, Kill Bill 2) while duking it out with Spider-Man after being revealed to Capt. John Stacy (James Cromwell) that Flint killed Ben Parker. Topher Grace plays the desperate Eddie Brock Jr., who after being humiliated by Peter Parker in the office dons the gift of the symbiont where he becomes Venom towards the end. I'm not sure if Harry Osborn could be consider a villain despite that in the film he carries amnesia and doesn't remember who he is after trying to kill Spider-Man.While we still have all the old characters from the first two movies from Aunt May (played by Rosemary Harris with such little time), J. Jameson (the talented J.K. Simmons) and so forth, the only other character introduced in the film is Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) who falls in love with both Spider-Man after a rush with death.Does Spider-Man 3 promise to keep the audience entertained? You bet!Is it better than Spider-Man 1? Yes! The two sequels ARE better than the original.Is it better than part 2? No! Part 2 was its own movie with dazzling special effects, non-stop action sequences and more like the Empire Strikes Back with more drama and care for characters.Will i get my money's worth? YES! Like i said, forget the critics! Go out there and have a good time watching Spider-Man 3.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Excellent (despite what critics have said)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1675941/?ref_=tt_urv","fung0","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur11701403/?ref_=tt_urv","17 June 2007","Having heard many of the lukewarm (to put it kindly) reviews, I went to see this film with no expectations whatsoever. Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be absolutely the equal of the other two in every way.I still find the criticism incomprehensible, other than as some sort of 'pack' phenomenon. Perhaps, feeling they've over-praised installments one and two, people feel the need to balance the scales by trashing number three. I simply don't know.What I do know is that on any meaningful basis, this is a great movie. It's more reminiscent of it's immediate predecessor, in that it strikes a - very marginally - better balance of action and drama than the original, and in that the CGI effects do a better job of humanizing the Spider-Man figure.Other than that, it's all the same good stuff. Raimi's genius in this series lies in realizing what made the original comic (i.e. the first 38 Ditko/Lee issues, as opposed to the several hundred issues of filler that followed) so wonderful: this is a story about Peter Parker, troubled, geeky teenager... NOT about Spider-Man, omnipotent super-hero. Raimi never lets you forget that. (The one negative consequence is a propensity for tearing off Spider-Man's mask... If it ripped that easily, the whole secret-identity thing would be a total loss right from the start.)Yes, like many other fans, when I heard that this film would have no less than three villains - 'Son of Goblin,' Venom and Sandman - I was concerned. No need. Raimi balances the three effortlessly, weaving them in and out of a single storyline, which remains relentlessly focused on Peter Parker. Raimi uses each villain (plus the competing newspaper photographer, and of course MJ) to counterpoint a different aspect of Parker's psyche. The action scenes flow from this, and hence each has real meaning, never degenerating into mere CGI slug-fest for its own sake.The dialog, the characterizations... they're just what they should be. This IS a comic book, and one of the more wacky and surreal ones to come from Marvel in its glory days. This movie mixes moments of excitement, humor and tragedy in just the right Marvel proportions, and on just the right slightly-larger-than-life scale. (Soap opera? Heck, yeah! Did it really take forty years for anyone to notice?)I have only three real quibbles. One, the endless Stan Lee cameo; fifteen seconds with his ego is like an eon in purgatory. (Hats off to the brilliant, irascible Steve Ditko for not even wanting his name in the credits.) Second, the giant-sized version of Sandman; it's unnecessary, and really only weakens the emotional impact of Sandman as a human-scale threat. And third, Peter Parker's big line at the end of the climactic fight; it's more awkward than it could have been. But these are minor points, and none of them diminishes my admiration and affection for this film.Some might say there's a fourth point: Peter Parker's ego-tripping in the middle part of the movie is SO well done, it does get painful to watch. I'm sure this is deliberate, and it's certainly not unfaithful to certain aspects of the comic. Raimi does a great job of depicting a guy who's making a TOTAL jerk of himself. That's kind of the whole point. These episodes create a contrast for the nobler side of Parker, which of course must come through if he's to pull things together in the end. I think we can all see ourselves in this. (Aside, maybe, from a few of us who really ARE total jerks, and have yet to discover that they even have a nobler side.)As I said, I have no idea what people found lacking in Spider-Man 3. It may be significant that many of the loudest criticisms are non-specific, of the ""this was utter crap"" variety. Maybe what we're hearing is the vague disappointment of fans who came late to the party and got hooked on later, 'cooler' versions of Peter Parker, and can't abide the notion that their hero could even HAVE a geeky, awkward side...Who knows? My advice: take a chance and check out Spider-Man 3 for yourself, with an open mind. I, for one, saw a great movie here. Maybe you'll get lucky and see it too.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I feel like I can't even have an opinion about the movie because it's so all-over-the-place. We get dramatic special effects scenes, stylized but cool villain battles, a strange black-suit core plot, a romance side story, and the typical villain back-stories. There have always been these kinds of elements in the Spiderman movies, but in this one, they're over-packed. There's just too much, and for the most part, none of it is great. I'll break it down into different sections so my vote will make sense.Effects Extravaganzas 8/10 The effects in the movie are breath-taking. The problem with the purely effects-based scenes is that the coolness factor wears off quickly. When Spiderman dives through wreckage in slow motion to save a damsel-in-distress (we later find that her name is Gwen Stacy), the excitement only lasts about a second. Then, I just wanted it to speed up.Romance Sub-plot 2/10 By far the worst part of the movie is this sub-plot. We meet a new possible love interest for Pete (the above-mentioned Gwen Stacy), but she proves to be a very thin and boring character in the film, kind of like Mary Jane. MJ does what she did in the first two films for the most part. She whines, cries, gets captured, has useless fights with Peter, and performs terribly on the stage. However, now these things are repetitive, and this installment amps them up to the max. MJ seems to whine constantly, her kidnapping is more predictable than in the first two, she performs badly on Broadway instead of a local theater, and all of her fun and deep enigma is gone. In addition, she and Pete take turns acting like jerks to each other.Villain Back-stories 3/10 I'll start by saying that Sandman is not exactly a menacing villain. His back-story is completely repetitive and ridiculous, verging on corny. Eddie Brock, on the other hand, could have been done well. However, Topher Grace turns in the worst performance of the film as Eddie, and does not become threatening or cool at all until he turns to Venom.Black Suit Core Plot 7/10 The parts of the film focusing on the black suit are not menacing, like I expected, but rather funny and quirky. Unfortunately, this campy plot does not fit with the rest of the film, which tries to be dark. Spidey and Peter Parker both get emo make-overs, and Peter becomes a loser who thinks that he's insanely cool, strutting down the street and dancing 1970s style.Villain Battles 10/10 The battles that Pete has with the New Goblin, Venom, and Sandman are the best parts of the film, and make it worth seeing. This is where the big budget comes into play. Seeing Spidey kick butt has never been so real as it is now. Though I give it a rather low rating, I urge you to see it just for the experience of seeing Spiderman as you've never seen him before in battle. Still, this movie has fallen under my expectations. Better luck next time, Mr. Raimi (if there is one).","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Was it made for children, was it a comedy movie or was it action movie? There is one reality that Spider Man-3 was made just for money. To earn money does not mean that it is a successful movie. Story was rather poor and full of blanks, players especially Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst acted in middle range, action scenes were not sufficient. Tobey Maguire was not colorful and charismatic; Kirsten Dunst seemed very poor and not interesting.Most of the scenes were captured from other movies such as Mask, Alien, weak Matrix and September 11th cases in the accident at the top of skyscraper. New Goblin, Sandman and Venom were seems to be created forcefully. Previous series did not support the last one. Enemy-Friend duality for New Goblin, good-bad habit Hulk style sandman, alien style Venom created not in skillful manner. To enrich the story spider's enemies increased in number on the other hand typical enemy concept was missed.In some part of dialogs, director tried to effect our emotions by using love, drama but clearly these dialogs were pathetic and funny. Church and Flag concept are depicted again and again. Spider find the right way in the church in front of USA flag, absolutely there was a speech at the end which was full of wisdom and full of suggestions. This sequence becomes bored and routine. We would like to expect more interesting endings. And please do not tell us how to behave to be a good citizen.

Firstly the effects are very good and so they should be considering the substantial budget this film had, the fight scenes are exciting and packed with action and the general idea for the storyline is good (with both Venom and Sandman) however this is also one of the major shortcomings.All of the characters even Peter himself are poorly defined. As a lot of other critics have noted Venom gets around 10-15 minutes of airtime with almost no character development. Peter's 'dark' side is almost laughable as half of the film is spent observing him doing incredibly outlandish and over the top things that just look ridiculous, from walking down the street acting suave and trying to chat up ladies to a 2 minute dance scene in a jazz club. This reflects poorly on Tobey Maguire's acting which is usually pretty good but throughout the film he seems slightly fake and detached.Overall I was very disappointed by the film often finding myself 20 minutes ahead of the action guessing CORRECTLY exactly what was going to happen.

But, and this is a big one, 20 minutes in the middle was a big piece of Pooh. Peter Parker goes from nice kid, to cocky, to goth all in that 20 minutes which was really bad, like come on dancing, down the street, to disco music, for 15 minutes, that made me wanna cry, but right after that scene the miracle of spider-man was reborn and left me walking out of theater happy! And venom, was of coarse my favorite villain even though i didn't see a lot of him.

I did like the character Sandman/Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), he was the only good up-point about the film, excellent character, some excellent scenes, the best villain yet.

Returning Director and Writer Sam Raimi along with co-writers Ivan Raimi and Alvin Sargent seem to be running on fumes in this third installment of the Spider-Man tale. Uncharacteristically, the storytelling is messy. There are way too many villains: New Goblin, Sandman, and Venom. Peter Parker's (Tobey Maguire) journey into Darth Vader territory, down the dark side ends up more repulsive instead of sympathetic. This is a critical miscalculation. Maguire's earnest and strong performance as Peter and Spider-Man barely salvages ""Spider-Man 3"". Overall, ""Spider-Man 3"" is well crafted and visually spectacularthat's all. I loved ""Spider-Man 2"". I thought that ""Spider-Man 2"" was not only a great sequel, but also a great movie on its own. ""Spider-Man 2"" had the great scene with Aunt May saying, ""I believe there is a hero in all of us"" That story was all about inspired greatness and being a hero. ""Spider-Man 3"" seems to have forgotten that cultural context. Although pretty to look at, ""Spider-Man 3"" is a shell with glossy veneer. This is a little disappointing coming from the talented Sam Raimi and Tobey Maguire.In ""Spider-Man 3"" the opening narration by Peter (Maguire) astonishingly sounds full of himself; thus, hinting the hero's pitfall. Peter seems to believe his own press clippings. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) is the lead on a Broadway show. Peter is thinking about asking MJ to marry him. Freelance news photographer Peter has a rival in smarmy Eddie Brock (Topher Grace). And he also has potential rival for his affections in the beautiful Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard). Harry Osborn (James Franco) has sworn vengeance upon Peter and Spider-Man for the death of his father. To add to the convolution, escaped criminal Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) goes through a surprising transformation in a scientific mishap. Marko may also be involved in the murder of Peter's Uncle Ben. Finally, an extra-terrestrial parasite infects Peter. This galactic symbiotic creature unbridles everyone's darker nature.""Spider-Man 3"" aspires for greatness. However, it is off focus, clunky and kluged. The strong performances by Maguire, Harris, and Franco are really left in a lurch without a compelling story. Fortunately, Raimi's narrative focuses near the end. Though clumsy throughout, I believe Raimi wanted to tell his story of forgiveness. Visually, the movie is stunning. The opening aerial battle between Peter and New Goblin (Fanco) is breathtaking. The inconsistent and bewildering Sandman effects are technical marvels. A lot of money was spent making ""Spider-Man"" look great. What would have served the movie might have been less villains and perhaps a cathartic examination of our own dark side. Tobey Maguire is great as Peter Parker. However, in his darker manifestation the normally engaging Maguire is not at all sympathetic. The misstep is almost costly, because of the inherent semi-comic tone. Maguire's innate earnestness and calm retrieve this from the abyss. On the other hand Kirsten Dunst comes off very whiny as MJ. Granted her character's life is not going as she had wished; she is still unpleasant. James Franco is charismatic as Harry.""Spider-Man 3"" has some spectacular action scenes. It is in its quiet moments void of ""sound and fury"" that the movie fails. There is not a compelling story to tell here. This comment really has no merit in the big picture. ""Spider-Man 3"" has as a shot at becoming the biggest grossing movie of all time. Perhaps, with all the returning talent in the inevitable ""Spider-Man 4"" Raimi and company can recapture the greatness of the classic hero tale that moves and inspires.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The third? That's tricky, but let me start off by saying it was good.Much of the movie was very emotional, which I thought brought the movie down a few notches. The movie was packed and no one got emotional or even quiet during the sad or ""touching"" moments. Every one was too busy laughing at the actors' most bizarre and hilarious facial expressions. It just didn't feel necessary to have so many scenes where the actors cry and look like chipmunks. The waterworks just wasn't doing it for me.That aside, there was a good arch pattern to the plot. You'll enjoy the new web swinging and the camera movements with it, and you'll be blown away by the action sequences. Maguire wasn't his usual self and the same goes for James Franco, and Kirsten Dunst was the usual ""I'm pretty, but also pretty helpless"" character but still good. Thomas Haden Church (Sandman) fit the part well in my opinion even though the character wasn't too exciting. Watching a man made of dirt fight spider-man probably won't go down as a classic moment in cinema history. I was doubtful that Topher Grace would make a good Venom, but I was impressed with the dark sarcasm and the egotistical persona that he brought to the character. He and Maguire had good chemistry, and portrayed the Eddie Brock and Peter Parker rivalry well. Speaking of Venom, he kind of freaked me out. Props to the CGI guys that made him.If you're looking for the best spider-man yet, you may be disappointed. If you just want to see Spidey kick some bad-guy ass, you're in for a hoot. Enjoy!PS: Once you watch it, you'll understand why Tobey doesn't want to do any more of these movies.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Instead of making a third Spider Man that, although great, could have been your regular superhero movie, he decided to make a comedy out of it. That's right. In this third installment of the Spider Man series, he pretty much creates a farce of the last two spidey movies, comic books, and action movies in general. And it worked perfectly.He uses blatant iconography fitting to the genre, and then makes fun of it every time he gets the chance. He created a comedy with beautiful effects and powerful drama, even if it was making fun of most other drama we see in movies. Didn't like the movie?

And what's with Spiderman taking his mask off every five seconds? Doesn't he understand the definition of ""secret identity""? Speaking of the mask, why is it that the mask always rips in the same places? With the inflated budget that this movie boasts, you'd think they could afford to make a new mask, rather than recycle the one Macguire wore in part one. LAME! This was like a parody of a Spiderman movie. The best part of the flick was the scene in the French restaurant with Bruce Campbell as the maitre D (spelling?) sporting a phony French accent and trying to help Peter pull off an extremely cliché'd engagement proposal. Seriously, skip this movie entirely or at least wait for video or the dollar theaters. ""Not worth it"" is an understatement. Oh, and the CG was unimpressive.

I hear remnants of a failed Batman franchise. Here Spider-man is being driven directly into the ground at no less then 140 minutes of screen time. Please for the sake of the fans, don't make Spidey 4,5,6,7 as originally planned before sitting down with a pad and paper and actually try to figure out how a good Spider-Man movie can come about. (see #1 & 2) On the contrary, not everything about the movie was complete garbage.

Some of the effects were incredible and this is the only saving grace in an otherwise weak film. I'm not a 'fanboy' expecting perfection, but I do love movies of all types. I have rarely seen a third installment of a franchise that is actually good but seriously, this is so poor it's not even funny (X-Men 3 was actually a lot better than this and that was extremely mediocre). I left before most people and I haven't read any reviews so I am basing this on my own feelings about the film rather than 'hearsay' or jumping on any sort of bandwagon. I would still expect this movie to do very well at the box office, but I must believe that for once Raimi missed the mark completely.

First of all the movie was fantastic. I didn't think that they would be able to give us such a story in 3 hours but they did and it was SUPERB !!!!. The Opening credits set the stage for the movie. (and boy did it ever deliver.)I was glad to see they picked this movie up right after the events of movie 2 . Instead of 2 or 3 more years had past.Their were a lot of story lines in this one (most of them were focused on The Big Three (Peter Parker - Mary Jane Watson - Harry Osborn .) I'm glad Raimi took the time to tie up all the lose ends from the first two movie dealing with the Character growth of the Big Three.Tobey really improved a lot from the first two movies . His Acting was much more believable this time around . And he kick ass as Black Symbiote Spider-man & Emo Parker .I liked Kirsten acting in this film (much better than the first two), Loved that her hair was freaking Red again (not the blast ugly orange from 2) also she's got a beautiful singing voice . All the actors casted as villains were prefect .Topher pull off Eddie & Venom. His Eddie character was perfect and represented that same cockiness that Eddie has always had. His Venom was wickedly cool . Loved The Voice James really step up and did an outstanding job as Harry Osborn/New Goblin . Every scene with him from the beginning to end was Spectaular .Thomas was Fantastic as Sandman . Boy did I feel for his Character, both his performance and his story was just amazing .Loved the Symbiote storyline, It was better than I thought it would've been .Finally a spider-man movie that had a lot more comedy , (their were so many funny scene in this movie as well as funny moments.)For Comedy JK. Simmons does it again as JJJ, as does Bruce Cambell .The music for Symbiote spider-man was cool as was The Theme for Sandy .All the action sequences kick mega ass . The Battle Royale was the best .I love the movie version of the Black Symbiote suit .New Goblin's suit as well as glider was wicked .Finally I thought this movie wrap up the trilogy with a bang .

"5","/10","So many subplots, so little time","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2645116/?ref_=tt_urv","StevePulaski","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23483288/?ref_=tt_urv","19 July 2012","Never in any superhero film I have seen has a heroine or a love interest gotten in as much trouble as Mary Jane Watson, still played by Kirsten Dunst. If she's not in trouble, she's a whiny, impenetrably jealous woman with mood-swings on the dime. She becomes bent out of shape from one petty kiss Spider-Man shares with Gwen Stacy, who is in Peter Parker's chemistry class, after he is awarded the key to the city early on in the film. And if she's not whiny and jealous, she's dangling helplessly, ""x"" amount of feet from land in a vehicle secured by webs strung in all different directions. Oh, now where's that dirty, rotten, cheatin' Spider-Man when you need him? Spider-Man 3 is a rather depressing and unsatisfying conclusion to a franchise that hit the ground running with its divine human scope, wonderfully colorful and cinematic special effects, and worthy performances from its entire cast. The original Spider-Man film was impeccably rewarding and undeniably entertaining, but more importantly, should be known as more than popcorn entertainment, but intelligent entertainment, with an appreciation and fondness for the human behind the mask and bearing it. Its sequel was even more impressive, depicting the agonies and the weight of being a College kid, a freelance photographer, a moderately-devoted romantic, a best friend, and a serene crime-fighting superhero all in a day's work. The stress on Peter Parker's shoulders was unbearable and the film, brilliantly written and directed, conveyed the angst and pressure perfectly.With the first film being more about familiarity with powers and the second film being more about the struggle of the job, I contemplated what the third film would focus on. I imagine the writers, Alvin Sargent and the brothers Raimi, Sam and Ivan, did as well. Apparently, none of them were easy to agree, because Spider-Man 3 feels like someone had a plethora of ideas and shot in the dark with most of them. The film tirelessly juggles five stern subplots, while seemingly trying to incorporate more, to the point of cinematic confusion.We are greeted again with Peter Parker, again, played by the effortlessly charismatic Tobey Maguire, who plans to romantically propose to the long-suffering Mary Jane Watson, who has just made her musical debut on Broadway. During their date, we see a strange, extraterrestrial symbiote crash-land on Earth and attach itself to the back of Parker's moped. Meanwhile, criminal Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), who will later become ""The Sandman,"" has just escaped from prison, and is ostracized by his wife and daughter.Before we go too much into that, the arrogant Harry Osborn (James Franco) returns and is infuriated at Peter Parker, who he believes is responsible for the death of his father in the first film. He carries on his dead father's orders to ""avenge"" him, and after a brazen fight in the New York City sky, Harry hits the ground hard and experiences short-term memory loss, making him forget his grudge towards Peter. He will inevitably regain his memory and transform into the ""New Goblin."" Before we go too much into that, Peter is also facing some harsh competition at ""The Daily Bugle"" newspaper (which is still run by the strict J. Jonah Jameson, continued to be played fantastically by J.K. Simmons) when Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), another freelance photographer, is hired by Jameson to try and catch Spider-Man doing something that would turn the town against him. Grace, who I continue to dub an underrated talent in film, plays Brock with admirable conniving instincts, and when he later must force himself into the role of ""Venom,"" he does a solid job for a villain so underwritten. Venom was a last minute addition to Spider-Man 3 and it greatly shows, since his story is given very minimal time to develop. The character of Brock, too, is only modestly fleshed-out, and his screen appearance is short when compared to the likes of Sandman and Osborn's ""Goblin."" Before we go too much into that, we can't forget Mary Jane is struggling to get work in the enormous state of New York. She continues to plod along in the vaguest of limelights, desperately trying to achieve her dream as a consistent Broadway performer, but reality gives her hard slaps to the face and the film is sure to try and illustrate those.And let's really not forget that symbiote that attached to Peter's moped and will eventually alter his personality by clinging to his body, giving his red spidey suit an unwanted black makeover. This will too turn the geeky, socially-awkward Parker into an over-confident, boastful cad with dark eyeshadow and a Gothic-like persona.There's Spider-Man 3 in the biggest nutshell I can find. I almost forgot to mention the redundancy in its sentimentality as well. This is without a doubt the sappiest Spider-Man extravaganza we've gotten and are likely to ever get from a film based on this character. Everybody offers some sort of advice to Peter, several characters shed tears, even the villains (which tremendously obscures how we're supposed to look at The Sandman in particular, with sympathy? Forgiveness? Or just nihilistic impulse because he's a villain?). Despite some extremely well-done effects work, easily making this the most visually impressive and eye-catching film in the series, the overwrought nature, the depressingly underdeveloped subplots, the shorthanded villain backstories, the repetitive sentimentality that creates an atmosphere more self-depreciating and mawkish than need be, and the needlessly emphasized issues that should've been left as subtle as possible, Spider-Man 3 is a big budget mess and a big budget disappointment.Starring: Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, Bryce Dallas Howard, James Cromwell, Rosemary Harris, and J. K. Simmons. Directed by: Sam Raimi.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

As I happen to be in China now, I was able to see it a few days early.Now, I went into this movie with the highest expectations possible. And for most of the picture, I was not disappointed. Unfortunately, being a 21 year old male from the US, I grew up watching the Spider-Man cartoons on fox and reading the comic books of the last ten years or so. Sam Raimi did not. He waxes nostalgic on a whole different era of villains. And it shows.Basically, I can't complain that they didn't stick to the source. What they did or didn't follow isn't nearly as important in this film as the wasted potential of the characters he chose to use in the film. He chose good characters, made them extremely interesting, and then gave them so little screen time that when the end of the movie came, I couldn't help but feel like despite the length of the film, some of the characters were rushed through the motions of their parts of the plot so quickly that they probably shouldn't have been involved at all.Sam Raimi said in an interview that one of the producers (or someone up there at Marvel, my memory isn't completely clear) told him that the fans were demanding Venom, and despite his lack of interest in the character, he needed to do the story. Well, what was done was barely a compromise. While the dark side of Peter is apparent from every trailer, they could have done that some other way and not wasted an opportunity with such an interesting villain. But Sam had to have his Sandman, obviously.Not to say that Thomas Haden Church and Topher Grace aren't high points of the movie. They are. They just don't get to be part of it that much.Now, to the rest of the movie: It is fabulous, it is great. The acting is great, the special effects are great, the plot is interesting. The special effects are worth the price of admission. Tobey is worth the price of admission. And i think this is Kirsten's best performance yet as Mary Jane.Unfortunately, it does drag a bit. I didn't mind, but I was in a theatre with 99.5% Chinese people, and conversations could be heard in the crowd at several points where it was just SLOW for an uneccessary amount of time. This is an extreme example, in another country where they don't appreciate melodrama as much, but that was the main problem. Where the first two movies had action, had comedy, had drama, this movie has melodrama. It's just doesn't tug at the heart strings like the previous movies, a lot of the time. The speeches get preachy, the moments of realization too obvious. It's very much like a lot of Raimi's other works I can think of. Which, is not a bad thing, mind you. But where the other two movies were so perfect because they were Spider-Man movies with a touch of the Raimi flavor, this was more a Sam Raimi movie staring Spider-Man.Now, I can tell you, that's not a bad thing to be. It's just not perfect.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Sam Raimi, once again, proves that is the right director for the Spidey-movie. He has the sensibility, the knowledge and the love for the character that a movie like this one needs to have.

The producers of these must have had something to do with the production of Spidey 3 (I'll explain these comparisons in my review). I dislike spoilers and think the best way to properly review this movie without giving it away is to compare it to other films and TV shows.I stopped guessing who was going to be caught kissing whom by the end and I just didn't care anymore. I went into Spidey 3 not expecting it to be as good as 1 & 2 (I had read other reviews), but good lord! It was like someone p*ssed on the iconic scenes from the first two movies. Shame on whoever came up with this mess.I don't mind complex characters. In fact I enjoy them, but it was like Dr. Phil was involved and wanted to show the tortured, tender sides of the villains, while Spidey is shown as no saint. Spidey 3 had the same problem I had with Elektra, I didn't know who to cheer for, and to top it off, Elektra had a better script. I'm serious. I'm not exaggerating. It was like the producers of Spidey 3 came up with all these great fight scenes and musical numbers first, and then realized they should have some kind of story to tie it all to together. The logic and motivations of the supposed ""good guys"" are completely off (even if they are being influenced by evil). The only truly good person is Aunt Mae, who randomly bursts onto the screen to offer pearls of wisdom akin to Yoda guiding a young Luke Skywalker.To top it off, the heroes are just plain stupid in the heart-to-heart dramatic scenes (don't worry, I won't spoil the heartbreaking moments). Just watch an episode of Dawson's Creek and that will give you a good example. The audience was actually booing and someone sitting behind me called MJ a b***h.The dialog was on the level of the junior high school kids in an after school special. It was obviously written by someone who'd never actually stepped into a college classroom. Peter Parker even gets picked on for being a nerd in a college-level physics class by a jock throwing spit balls at his head and another shining a mirror in his eyes while he's trying to read the chalkboard.I won't go into the massacre of the Gwen Stacey character (Peter's lab partner).There are some continuity problems which can jerk a watcher out of the moment which are quite annoying (my brain would go ""wait a minute"" when the poor editing would change what a character was doing in mid-sentence).The only reason I suggest seeing this on the big screen is for the special effects. They're pretty amazing. The Sandman is quite breathtaking.See Spidey 3 if you must, but expect a huge spectacle like Xanadu with flashy numbers and thin dialog in the middle. You've been warned.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It, unlike X-Men last year, comes full circle-, with the plot successfully relating back to the first and second movies. The plot- 3 villains and enraged Spiderman for the second act, can it work? Supisingly yes, and thanks to some superhero teaming up, the line is drawn and somehow, the editors to their behalf have found a way to cram such a varied storyline into the limited time-frame. The action is superb, and this is the best web-slinging action yet, not to mention the SFX wonder of Sandman. That begin said, Bryce Dallas Howard's acting isn't suited to the character, who struggles to find her feat in the film. The presence of the media turn an emotion packed finale into a cheesy moment. Choopy editing in the first act seems to jumpy, and while Venom, looks great- the voice doesn't sound so. Emo-Peter Pakrer, also doesn't suite choreographed dance sequences, an out-of place moment in the film. However- Spiderman 3 finds its feating in the superb action, visuals, SFX, plot, and the acting of the leading 3 (and Thomas HAden Church). In all- it does what it was meant to do. Full circle the trilogy with substance and style.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But 'Spider-Man 3' is pretty terrible. I think the major problems with this film come from 3 big mistakes: 1) Trying to outdo the first 2 Spidey films. I.e., Spidey #1 had 1 super-villain, #2 had 2 super-villains, therefore #3 should have 3 villains. This doesn't work because these villains are clearly too much for Spidey, thus necessitating some extremely unbelievable and stupid plot twists. And it doesn't work because there isn't enough time to develop any emotional interest in the hero-villain conflict.2) It's obvious that this movie was created to produce maximum video/computer game spinoffs. The menu screen of the DVD features video game versions of Spidey and other characters moving about in video game style and a couple of the 'special features' are video game promos. The creative decision to go this way has led to fight scenes that are way too long, break too many laws of physics too often, shatter all sense of believability, and feel downfight oppressive and exhausting. My guess is that for those of us over 35, at least those of us who don't play computer games daily, our eyes are simply not geared fast enough to really follow this kind of action.3) Over-reliance on Computer Generated Images (CGI). The fight scenes all look like either cartoons or video games, and so you just don't have the kind of dramatic involvement required to suspend disbelief. In the old days, directors had to rely on tricks of editing, camera position, stuntmen, harnesses, etc. to create exciting and believable fight scenes. Now that those gimmicks aren't necessary, directors seem to think we'll just buy into anything. Not so: the old school fight scenes, where you had stunt men doing what was vaguely possible intercut with close ups of the actors' faces, looking angry, exasperated, sweaty, etc., had much more dramatic impact. Sean Connery, Errol Flynn, Johnny Weismuller, Steve McQueen and Clint Eastwood never needed CGI. Hollywood seems to think that CGI solves all problems of special effects and fight scenes. Not so: CGI looks fake, just in a new way.Overall, Spider-Man 3 is bad because it follows the conventions and formulae of most modern action films: more, harder, bigger, badder, etc. and full-speed ahead with the games and merchandising. This movie is all about the paycheck, there is neither heart nor soul.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I am kind of surprised to see so many votes and a high note here. I am pretty disappointed about many of the critics. I went to the movie and I was wondering if it can get more worse as the movie was playing. First of all I think the actress not only that is playing bad but she is also unattractive. She has tons of make-up and she is totally not fitting for the role. The only roles that fit in the movie are Topher Grace and J.K. Simmons who looks pretty funny, but the rest.... Story, it generally goes in a Spiderman way but it has so many problems and so many downwards that I could not imagine. Funny how Sandman/Flint Marko ended being a sandman, rather hilarious. The part where Tobey Maguire playing the Macho? that was fun, was fun to see how it ruins more and more the movie, I think of that part as being one of the most homosexual thing I seen so far. Too many errors in the movie, and investing 250m$ in it, I practically don't believe it. The only part I liked is the final battle when they do good work on the effects.

It was totally worth the patience. This movie is one of the best movies i HAVE EVER seen. It was also a LOT like THOUSAND times better than the first two part. I mean the previous two parts weren't that exciting and entertaining. This movie involved some humor, fun, emotions and everything along with its MINDBLOWING action scenes. Also in all the parts Spiderman is shown as a nerdy person, but in this one it also involved the cool side of him when he is wearing black spidey suit. And we simply can't IGNORE those superb dance moves. Wow, everyone from the audience were clapping for it. Generally some movies are enough for the first time you watch it but this one is like you can keep on going to theatres to watch this movie again & again. Hats off to this movie and I am so.............. excited for another one to come out(hope it does). Also I am waiting for its DVD to come out the moment it hits the stores.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The action sequences leave much to be desired as there's not a single one that stays in your mind five minutes after its over.The fight sequence with doc ock on the train and on the buildings(the one with aunt may)were really stunning and you'd think that this one with its host of ""bad guys"" would just be jam packed with the best stuff yet.But all you get is a whole lotta third rate stuff of which you can hardly make anything out because most of the action sequences are at night.(probably to bring out the so-called ""Dark"" nature of the movie)Which brings me to the characters and performances.the only one u can actually say who did a half decent job in this movie is James Franco(not saying he was good but was better than the rest).The character of sandman is absolutely unnecessary and i think it's been added to the lot just to make the fan think a lot before the movie.For me the Sandman was probably as essential or important as Bruce Campbell thinks he is in any of the spider-man movies.Thomas Haden hardly has much to do so he cant really be judged.Kirsten Dunst is just another prop(and should have been in the play in which she features in the movie).Tobey Maguire fails to make the audience feel the varying emotions for Peter Parker that he has made them feel in the last 2 parts.Which ultimately brings me to Venom.Now I'm a big Venom-fan from the comics and i thought that this might just turn out to be the necessary ingredient to save the movie cos venom's appearance is saved until the end.But unfortunately Venom isn't half as scary as he's supposed to be and Topher Grace as Eddie Brock is another unnecessary distraction.So all of you who are looking forward to getting a peek at venom...don waste your time watching this movie.Just pick up[ a good old' comic book and enjoy!On the whole this movie is filled with unnecessary scenes,has no plots or sub-plots in-spite of having so many characters,filed with unnecessary characters.Its very obvious that the filmmakers haven't paid attention to having a a good script.The focus seems to have been on how to make the characters look like they are from the comic book and how to make the costumes look great.Its hard to believe that these guys actually churned out movies like spidey1 and 2.And this movie's faintly reminiscent of superman returns which was also a massive disappointment.Basically this movie should never have been made.It turns out to be flatter than the soda you take into the hall.Please don't waste your money on this.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

SPIDERMAN 3 has finally swung through oncoming traffic and in and around the tallest buildings to land in theatres as the flagship film to launch the box office into summer. Legions of Spidey enthusiasts have had their tickets for weeks while critics have been waiting to review the latest installment in one the most successful and well-received film franchises in history. With expectations this high, its hard to imagine how Spidey could possible satisfy anyone fully. Yet despite the increasingly loud whispers of disappointment waiting to welcome SPIDERMAN 3, this critic slash Spidey enthusiast had himself one heck of a web slingin' time and he's not afraid to say it.In the third, and what is sadly not likely the last in the Spiderman series, your friendly neighborhood Spiderman (Tobey Maguire) finds himself on top of the world. New York loves him; Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) loves him; and subsequently, Spidey ends up loving himself a little more than he should. High on his own ego, he decides to make everything perfect in his life and ask MJ to marry him. Simple enough a concept but things get a little sticky when he has to deal with his uncle's killer escaped from jail, his best friend's obsession with getting revenge on him for his father's death, having to compete with a new photographer at the Daily Bugle and MJ's increasingly disastrous acting career. Oh, wait. I forgot that he also has to deal with The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) and Venom (Topher Grace), the newest enemies to emerge in New York City, a city where freaks apparently flock to. It's a lot for one man to handle, let alone one man with super human powers. Ultimately, it proved to be too much for another super human to handle, namely returning director, Sam Raimi. Taking over script duty with his brother Ivan, found a lot of interesting themes like revenge and ego woven into the Spidey web but so much going on leaves so little to fully develop. Scenes that would seem pivotal, like when Venom and Sandman decide to team up, end up feeling rushed while scenes that are entirely disposable, like when Spidey's alter ego, Peter Parker, finds his ""Saturday Night Fever"" groove strutting down the streets of NYC, seem to go on forever.While the first SPIDERMAN film, written by David Koepp (rumoured to be returning for SPIDERMAN 4) brought me to tears more than once, there is plenty to enjoy in SPIDERMAN 3 that allows forgiveness for the script problems. People seem to have forgotten that Spidey is here to entertain us. Sure it would be nice to be affected by the words being spoken as well but when the action is as tight and the special effects as vast as in SPIDERMAN 3, it is a pleasure to tune out for a while and enjoy the ride. With three enemies to fight off at any given moment, Spidey finds himself constantly reevaluating his approach. With the New Goblin (James Franco), Spidey has to fend off a very aggressive attacker that he doesn't truly want to hurt. The Sandman, who enters and exits in a flurrying sandstorm that is a visual kaleidoscope of grain, is at times an insurmountable force. The fact that Spidey can't effectively hit him only further shows how much energy is wasted on revenge (as he was the man who actually killed his uncle in his pre-Sandman days). And Venom is just plain frightening. Being under the control of the tar-like substance that transforms cocky photographer, Eddie Brock (Grace), into this fanged fright, amplifies all of your aggressive, negative behavior. For Spidey, fighting Venom is like fighting all the parts of himself that he tries so hard to leave behind.When SPIDERMAN hit theatres a few in 2002, its energy was infectious. Hopes were high and the goods were delivered. Genuine admiration was formed for the hero but like any hero, people eventually want to tear them down out of jealousy. How quickly we forget the love and allow our expectations to be set so high that no one, not even a man who glides gracefully through the sky, could surmount them. Better than the second, not as good the first, SPIDERMAN 3 is falling prey to the audience's need to be constantly wowed with something bigger and better that eclipses accomplishments that are already awesome. Sure Raimi got himself tangled up in his own overcomplicated web but there is no one who can spin it like he can. And if Raimi, Maguire and Dunst don't return for future installments, you'll all be wishing you hadn't squashed this spider so quickly.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was telling myself that it was going to be super! (I loved the other 2 movies). Yet, what a disappointment. Something went so terribly wrong.. I don't know about you, but I felt the movie was too detached, there were too many villains(although at first, I was excited about the 3 villains) for Spider-man to handle and well, it was too romantic! I agree that it proved to me of why I love Spider-man the most out of the other action heroes, that he is just an ordinary guy who is down-to-earth who screws up every now and then, but this was just to soapy!! No doubt the effects and actions were awesome, but let's face it..that isn't everything! In terms of storyline, it was a total mess! It was like a song, having a beautiful melody and the world's best musicians to play it, but having a lyrics that does not make sense! And another thing I've notice, people started to walk out after 2 hours and more couldn't wait to walk out before the movie really ended! So maybe I wasn't the only one who thought it kinda sucked.

The comics, toys and everything else related to Spider man I have shown a keen interest in. Hence, i was anticipating this movie ever since I left the theater after watching the last one. That's why it is so disappointing to have to criticize this movie. I really tried to like it. But the movie was so clichéd and jam packed that there was no space for the story to actually communicate to audiences.My whole theater laughed at the serious parts, and I'm sure everyone else's experience was the same. There was a lot of good in this movie. But the bar they set in the last movie meant that everyone else expected a lot more good and a lot less bad.If you haven't seen this then you probably will down the line. It is worth watching and it isn't a bad movie. It is just so disappointing that they didn't take more time to iron out the flaws.P.S. - i'd take Bat nipples over stupid ass butler any day.

I invited my best friends to it and we were on a sort of hype in order to watch it. To be honest, I didn't like the first Spider-Man; the second, I believe was awful. Now, the third... Well, I give it a sentimental value only because of watching it with my friends. Technically speaking, it may have some effects that remind me of The Mummy; some scenes are almost as watching a regular diary of a blown off teenager. And then, A MUSICAL SCENE (!)I believe that Columbia should have been more thorough in hiring a director that only bluffed about having a Spider-Man poster on his door as a young filmmaker, talking about how he loved the character and all that junk. I even liked the focus on Fantastic Four better than this one (considering that I also hated it). Hero flicks are drowning in a high budget investment and lots of marketing strategies to compensate it. The storyline is every time lighter, less brainy and completely boring. Heck, there was even a point when we counted 8 consecutive yawns during the feature, and a friend of mine asked: ""what's the name of this movie, again, Spider who?""Bring more talent, people; bring more brains rather than brawl and teen inner conflicts. Less propaganda, please, and more essence of the story. God Almighty, please deliver us from Sam Raimi and Brett Ratner, as well as from uninteresting sagas. Please bring back the time of the superb X-Men, the smart V for Vendetta, the arabesque Hellboy and the beautifully narrated Blade.And by the way, Spidey, pack Mr. Raimi's bags and go back to sniff on Stan Lee's rear.

Both are missed used in this poor excuse for an enjoyable movie. I guess I should admit upfront that I didn't really care for any of the previous Spidey movies. I just can't get into Tobey as Spidey and the really nerdy behavior the writer made up for him. I prefer the comic book Spidey, no super smooth hero, but no nerd either. The Mary Jane character just continues to get on my nerves. These are the two most dysfunctional people on the planet. Raimi is good at comic relief, he should have inserted alittle more and I would have liked the film better (I missed his wife, Lucy Lawless. He should have given her a cameo, too). The special effects were okay but if you've seen one computer generated scene you've seen them all. The villains, of course are exceedingly more interesting than our hero or his whiny girl friend. And on another more serious note, there were a lot of little kids in our theater and they were in a word bored. The violence was way too much for them, the parents should have screened it first. The fight scenes were in fact on necessarily violent. I wondered after this movie was over whether or not Raimi realized how ridiculous his premise was, so its okay for Spidey by his actions allowing people to die but its not okay for villains to kill people. I know that there are a lot of people in prison today who wish they could just say they were sorry and get out, maybe we should start a movement in this country. If you're poor and steal or kill, which is about 80-90% of AA men in prison, if you say you're sorry we'll let you out to be with your daughter too. I like that Raimi but you should have used a black guy.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

We missed this movie in the theaters a few years ago, read some of the lackluster/negative reviews of the film in the media, and didn't make seeing in 2007 a priority. I regret this, having just viewed the film on DVD this weekend.What an outstanding, if uneven, movie. While I can agree with some of the people writing here who are critical of a few bits of clumsy dialog and exposition, it by no means detracts from those many places in the film where the movie WORKS.Part way through the film, I found myself remembering some of the lapses and flaws in the narrative of the first two films, and I became worried that there would be a new set of loose ends hanging by the end of this. But to my surprise, it all fell into a satisfying state of resolution.I have discovered in the news that none of the creative people of this set of Spiderman films will continue in the series, with Spiderman 4 set for a 3D release in 2012. I think this third movie places a perfect end-cap on the story arc, and sets the bar adequately high for any future inheritor of the franchise keys.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This one, however, feels like they didn't really even try. Here's why.The action sequences were good. They weren't great like the first two, but I think we all learned from the Matrix that the same effects get old by the third movie. The problem was that there were so few action sequences.The movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes long. This is about an hour longer than it should have been. There were scenes that didn't even have any purpose, that somehow didn't end up on the cutting room floor. This is inclusive of all the singing and dancing. We could have gone our whole lives without all of that.The characters didn't seem to be themselves. When spidey gets the black suit, Peter turns into some angry emo kid. I won't give anything away at the end, but suffice it to say that the ending is uncharacteristic of the people who are involved.All in all there were parts of the movie that were supposed to be super dramatic and pivotal to the plot, but left the audience laughing at the cheesiness and awkwardness of them. Everyone let out a sigh of relief when it ended. Not because it resolved anything, but because we didn't have to be subjected to it anymore.If you are a HUGE Spider-Man fan, go see it anyway. If you're just looking for a good movie to see check out Hot Fuzz instead.Frank C","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Brings in Characters that Spider-Man fans will Recognize, and is loaded with action. Spider-Man 3 is obviously darker the Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Man. The ending is the only near disappointment. And for Spider-Man fans the ending, the way the black costume (and the film's 3rd baddie looks) will probably be a little disappointing. So far this year Spider-Man 3 appears to the most memorable movie.

Maybe that's not fair. In my book, you spend more money on a movie than any other, I think that high expectations are justified.This was supposed to have action, suspense, and humour. Was it really supposed to be an overlong melodramatic soap opera? My only impression when I left was that Sam Raimi turned spiderman into a ""chick movie"".I can say without question that the action sequences were quite good. The producers got what they paid for. However, there were sequences (primarily involving Harry) that seemed very cartoony.From there, I'm not sure what to say. It is a comic book movie, and shouldn't be taken too seriously. The movie seemed very long. There were massive segments dripping with melodramatic cheese. During one particularly long segment, my wife leaned in and said: ""This is boring."" And she was right. I checked my watch several times - never a good sign for a movie.Maybe I wasn't in the right demographic? Not so...looking around, there were many kids looking for more spidey action. Instead, they were left to jump around on chairs and run for refills of popcorn as the dramatic pieces bored them to pieces.When all was said and done, Spiderman 3 was too long, too boring, and had too few over the top action sequences to make up for the badness.Oh...and Emo Peter Parker was so bad I found it hard to watch. At least fans of the Cure finally have a comic movie with scenes they will identify with.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

So, I went to this very excited. What a complete let down.I was so bored. Even with three villains they couldn't keep me paying attention.The dialog is so terribly melodramatic and unreal people in the audience were actually laughing when characters on screen were crying and revealing their innermost feelings.Characters swung from one side to the other, from good to evil, just by hearing a couple of honest words or seeing the light that seemed to come from absolutely nowhere? Okay, the special effects were really good. They keep getting better and better. The Sandman's scenes were especially well done.But what I loved about the last two movies was their integrity in regards to character motivations and emotions. This one just planted feelings on the surface and relied on whining and tears to emote.The writers this time are the ones to blame.

No talking, please sit still.. And as an added extra.. ""even if Spiderman 3 is amazing, you still have to walk out saying Superman returns was far better"".. Take note, the last rule was a joke and the kids were under no obligation to follow it to the letter...So we all sit in our seats... Me, Jo, Kai (9), Nick (7) and their friend Callum (8) The trailers played Harry Potter, Shrek 3, Transformers, Pirates 3 and the Simpsons.. And then Spiderman 3. I'll cut straight to the chase and maybe dissect the film later. Spiderman 3 is an awful film. Easily the least entertaining of the three spider movies.. yes even worse than the bore fest that was Spiderman 2.Spiderman 3 (IMO) lacks action, sadly the action that is seen on screen is handled very badly.. We have CGI that rivals the most awful Superman returns CGI in the crap stakes, we have action scenes riddled with plot holes (yes, Spidey saves Gwen Stacy when she falls from the building.. But Spidey old mate.. you seem to have forgotten all about the out of control crane)We have Harry (hey i'm evil.. hey i've lost my memory, hey my memory's back and i'm evil again.. Hey, Peter just blew me up with a bomb and all I got was this lousy facial scar..Hey I've had a chat with the butler and now i'm gonna be Peter Parkers best mate again) Osbourne.. OK there was a point to Harry, He's always wanted MJ and yes he blames Spidey for the death of his father.. But surely if Harry were to become the goblin he'd have at least created a costume/glider that resembles that of the Goblin? or did Harry also agree that perhaps the Spidey 3 toyline may need a little action figure related boost?Eddie (bugger me, Peter Parker found out I photo shopped a spidey picture and he got me fired now he must DIE!!!!!) Brock... I think he has anger management issues.Sandman.. I liked Sandman, I though most of his CGI was handled pretty well.. Well, it was a bit CGI from the Mummy, but it kinda worked. Spiderman 3 had 3 villains.. Sadly there was no room for 3 villains in this film. Dropping Sandman in 3 and maybe using him in 4 would have been a better option..Things that really got my goat about Spiderman 3Spiderman and his joy of removing his mask in public places... Spidey, the mask is there for a reason surely?Peter Parker and his Saturday night fever strut down the street. Cringe worthy to say the least.Peter Parkers dance routine in the jazz bar. Cringe again.Once again (I presume) A huge comic book character gets killed off in a Spiderman film. So far Raimi has managed to kill off Green Goblin, Doc Ock, Venom and Harry Osbourne... I really hate when film makers kill of characters like this, remember batman (89) when they killed off Joker? Bloody hell.I also hated the shameless way Spiderman just had to go past the stars and stripes flag on his way to battle Venom and Sandman... Hated it.. Not sure why, I just did.I didn't enjoy Spiderman 3. ( ""NO! Really?"" I hear you cry) And sadly neither Jo or the kids enjoyed it either, they all found it boring, something a Superhero film simply should not be.One thing I did like tho was this... The scene during the Spidey/Goblin VS Sandman/Venom.. J.J.J. is trying to buy a camera off a small girl.. Take a good look at the blonde extra standing next to J.J.J.. Her overacting is hilarious.. In fact.. Blonde extra chick.. You were the star off the show.. Hurrah! You saved this film from being a total waste of my time and money.Spiderman 3... 3 out of 10It would have been 2 out of ten but blonde extra chick made me add that extra point.PS In all honesty the kids actually did agree that Superman returns was much better.PPS So did I.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The first two films were quite successful, which anticipated the appearance of the third work of the franchise. Sam Raimi and the screenwriters clearly decided to raise the bar, piling up the tape not only with new characters, but also massively intertwining the fate of the characters so that by the middle of the film it was quite possible to get confused who and with whom is in what relationship at this particular moment in time. As a result, I will not lie to my soul, saying that it is customary to scold the film in the society of moviegoers. However, in my opinion, the picture came out quite decent, becoming a kind of completion of the story of Peter Parker performed by Tobey Maguire. Looking ahead, it should be noted that the fourth part of the series was planned, but it was not destined to see the light. It is quite possible that it was the successes and failures of the third film that sealed the fate of the failed sequel.In the third film about a friendly neighbor, from the very start we are shown that the main characters are doing fine. In the relationship between Peter and Mary Jane, everything seems to be cloudless. However, like the sword of Damocles, the threat from Harry Osborne looms. Ever since the end of the second film, this unpleasant feeling of danger for the Spider and his loved ones has not left, when Harry revealed the secret of his father Norman Osborn. A predictable plot begins to develop when, in addition to difficulties with a new opponent, Spider-Man has problems due to an incomprehensible cosmic entity that decided to get attached to him like a parasite. In addition, the symbiont reveals the lowest feelings of the carrier, which is shown in the changed Peter.However, in this rapid development of the plot, you involuntarily notice how the scenario moves seem to be adjusted to the events necessary for the authors. Sometimes everything looks a little like the truth. For example, Spider-Man does not look like himself, conflicts between the characters arise out of the blue, which makes the work somehow unreal. And this is a significant blunder of the film.On the other hand, you feel a certain dislike, probably, for each main character. Their actions surprise and upset. It seems that Sam Raimi decided to reveal the basest instincts of his heroes, turning literally everyone into a kind of villain. At least I didn't have a feeling of strong empathy for Parker, Osborne or Watson. It seems they deserved everything that happened to them in the first half of the film.The classic twist of the third work of the trilogy also works in the film, which sends us to the first, where lies the deception. And if this topic was revealed well enough in the film ""Scream 3"" (although everything was probably far-fetched there too), then here an unexpected turn does not fit into the canvas at all, and the disclosure of the plot twist makes you frown and even resent out loud. However, I was ready to accept this turn of events because of the arch of a Sandman named Flint Marco, who carries his burden of a murderer and just wants to be near his daughter. The story of this antagonist catches, makes you see the world of Spider-Man from a different side. The scriptwriters explore the nature of the villain for the third time involuntarily. If Norman Osborn and Otto Octavius were such in the first two films, then Flint Marco became such a hero here.The third film raises the level of action on the screen. There are an order of magnitude more battle scenes here. Sure. Opponents also increased. In order for the viewer to enjoy a beautiful picture, it was necessary to surprise with various scenes of chases and fights. It turned out quite well. The film still looks great today from this point of view.The finale is touching. Each of the heroes reconciles with his ""I"" and finds solace in the strong friendship that each of the trinity carries through the years. The bright dawn of a new day seems to tell the audience that everything is behind us, and something new awaits the heroes, which by coincidence will already remain behind the scenes.""Spider-Man 3"" came out as a worthy completion of the famous and now classic trilogy. It's a solid blockbuster with good drama inside. Let the film stand apart from the first two pictures, still this story is undoubtedly necessary for a full immersion in the world of Peter Parker and his loved ones.10 out of 10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Spiderman 1 is still 100x better than number 3. They should stop with the cash-cow approach in Hollywood, and become more imaginative and creative! The movie is filled with ""cheap"" special effects, where it's very clear that Spiderman is a 3D animation, rather than a ""real"" character. Even my 12 year old son thought it was disappointing compared to number one (and two). I had hoped they would raise the bar with this one - meaning the bar that allows you to think you're in the movie, rather than being a spectator. Movies should bring emotions, and the more the better - this movie didn't bring any emotions over, I mean, none! It's time for more Stanley Kubricks, Alfred Hitchcocks and Roberto Benignis, as I think the world has seen enough Spidermans for the next 100 years.

I was so excited to watch it because of the drama and action which was going to take place. When I watched it, I still left happy. I still talked about it with my girl friend and family. We all loved it. We all agreed that there was a little ""too much"" put into it to fully love it. Like many people say, it sort of lacked the brilliance of spiderman 2. Spiderman 2 was awesome! Spiderman 3 was good. See the difference? Besides all the ""Too much"", I was looking for a lot of involvement with Venom. Lets do a little history, Venom is spiderman's worst and deadly enemy because venom has his exact same powers but more deadlier, spiderman can't use his spider senses, and he is a major threat to spiderman. It really lacked those options. It would've been nice if we saw Spiderman and Venom web slinging in the town and fighting each other. That didn't happen, sadly. :( .... The movie could've honestly left out sandman and use more of venom, or vice versa of using sandman throughout the whole movie. (which ever will make u smile) In the movie, we never got to see why venom was such a threat. The only thing we knew was he had powers like spiderman.Another thing which sadly ""sucked"" was spiderman kept getting his butt whoopped or ""served"". In Spiderman 2, Spiderman was an awesome fighter, and we could tell Peter learned new moves and learned more of using his abilities. Spiderman 3 failed to prevail that to us. Spiderman was just web slinging and not much action until his black suit came on. It leads to the question, does spiderman know how to fight? Spiderman is supposed to be a better fighter, and be more smarter and wiser.We know Spiderman has spider senses right? Well, it wasn't in the movie. There was not a scene where spiderman had a prediction and moved as quickly as possible. It sadden me when I notice this. Spiderman could've been like batman, but he knew how to shoot out a web. This movie was kind of rushed and missed key important figures.However! Peter Parker does an amazing bad boy act. People criticize it, but I thought it was funny and fun. OK. Peter Parker is a dork right? He is nice right? Well isn't that suppose to be reversed because of the transformation which the outer-space creature does to him? Tobey Maguire did a great job at it. We never expected him to do anything of that nature. Tobey Maguire in general is a mild manner guy, and isn't knownfor a ""bad boy"" attitude. He made it fun, and showed us a sign of acting. Stop messing him! He did a great job.The movie picks up very well! It doesn't go into a whole new chapter and has no relativity. Spiderman 3 picks it up very well, but just misses a few figures which doesn't top em all. The action was great and so was the effects. You gotta them credit for the effects. They are as real as they can be; however, it doesn't have a whole new jump start like spiderman 2. I hope if another one is made, the next producer can bring venom back and do some more work. The sandman showed it's purpose. Venom did not. Venom is like dark side with Superman. Dark side is more powerful than Superman, and Superman has to use everything he can to win. Venom didn't serve his same purpose. We saw how spiderman was no match, but we want more. That's it. Spiderman 3 is still a great sequel; sadly, not many movies has a 3rd film to pick up all the rest of the films. It would've been nice to see it, but sadly it couldn't compete. Again, the movie is good or great however you want to say it. Many people criticize because they aren't spiderman fans. Any Spiderman fan would love it. It lacked a few figures","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

After about half an hour I was bored, and so were these 4 teenage girls sitting in the row behind. They decided to talk loud, kiss their teeth at anyone telling them to be quiet, answer their mobiles, even though those wonderful guys from Orange have spent millions advertising their product, oh and asking if we'd turn our phones off during the movie.Anyway, the screen in front was showing some chick flick with inconsistent special effects, rubbish story line etc, still no action yet. The action behind me was unfolding nicely, a guy next to me threatened to call security on the motor-mouthed teen girls. They called his bluff, he got up an marched off in a huff., the girls said ""your mum!"". A minute later he returned with a bean-pole, drink of water of an usher who couldn't scare a pigeon, he asked them to be quiet, they did, for about 3 minutes. Meanwhile, I think something happened in the movie, but can't remember what, Kirsten Dunst was on screen so that made me turn my head round at the naughty girls again. By now they were throwing sweet wrappers at each other, great fun! I think Sandman had arrived in the movie, but the girls were more entertaining.The guy next to me's blood was boiling, he waded through our row, and got security on the lovely teenage girls! This time, a security guard came, he looked really tough, taking on four 14 year olds, rather than throw them out, he sat next to them, they kept commenting under their breath that this was ""wrong"" it was ""nuff bad"", I thought ""rather like the movie!"" Anyway the film dragged on then ended. Its not very good at all, if you're under five or like Hollyoaks then you may like it.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Particularly with Suprhero movies ( *cough* Batman Forever *cough*).After the literal waves of both critical and fan acclaim for Spider-man 2, this sequel immediately had a lot to live up to. However the announcement that this instalment would have three villains pushed concerns with some fans.ever since the movie's release, a mass of negative reviews have surrounded it, with IMDb users split on either side.But despite the harsher critical response than to its predecessors, and the vast amount of controversy surrounding the film amongst fans, Spider-man 3 is a hugely enjoyable, engaging and breath-taking spectacle.Where previous instalments have eased us into the action with smaller, and in the long-run unnecessary set-pieces, Spider-man 3 begins with a fabulously kinetic battle between Peter and his revenge-obsessed old friend Harry. Moving at a faster speed than any of the franchise's previous fight scenes could muster, it also has a powerful emotional edge.Admittedly, this first action sequence is never quite trumped, but several other set pieces come close.However the Spider-man films have never been simply about the action scenes, but also about character progression. the film serves as a great bookend to the character of Peter,as with each film he goes through a different stage on the struggle caused by his abilities- First the struggle to emerge, Second the struggle to be accepted and in this film the struggle with arrogance and one's own darkness.Tobey Maguire once again captures the essence of Peter Parker flawlessly, and in a highly unique, Saturday-Night Fever inspired sequence, puts an entirely new spin on the character.As eve Sam Raimi proves himself one of the great modern directors, skillfully mixing jaw-dropping special effects with moving human story lines- take for a example an extremely profound scene showing the birth of Sandman- literally like a newborn he struggles to stand up but keeps falling, eventually succeeding through sheer determination. Though the scene is entirely computer-generated it is a heartfelt portrayal of the character's birth.This time round, Raimi's direction of the more emotionally engaging scenes has a far defter and much more accomplished touched and as per usual he mixes plenty of humour in- Bruce Campbell's cameo in this one absolutely blows away his small roles in the previous two, and once again J.K. Simmons makes maximum impact out of a small role.However there are many points where Spider-man 3 come dangerously close to falling. The appearance of the symbiote is dealt with clumsily and at times the screen feels cluttered with villains. Also an otherwise excellent final showdown is marred by a ridiculous reporter and a young girl selling Jameson a camera.But the main point of the film is to entertain, and it does so superbly while still keeping an emotional integrity that never goes over the top or outstays its welcome. Raimi and his cast walk a thin line but keep balance most of the time, with many inspired and refreshing scenes (The previously mentioned Saturday night fever scene and a surprisingly light cooking scene) more than making up for most of the shortcomings.Again an excellent cast, with James France shining in particular along with great villain performances from Topher Grace and Haden-Church, this Spider-man is, at least in my opinion, the strongest of the three, for the first time making clear its highly important theme and moral message- ""To err is human. To forgive is divine"" Spider-man 3 - 9/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'm talking about the soap elements, that run through this film (as they also did in the previous Spider Man movies by Sam Raimi). But I will go into that, later in this review!Let's begin with the credits. They are in the same style as they were in Spider Man 2, but they use another main color here (suitable for this movie). They also tell you the story so far. So even if you forgot a few things, you'll see them in the intro again. The beginning of the movie is quiet and revolve around the characters. There's a sense of danger here and there, but you're not getting the vibe that you're in a Superhero movie (which must have been intentional).Once the movie kicks off, you get great action pieces aplenty. Sam Raimi also humanizes his villains. Which isn't a bad thing per se, but not if it is done in that form of kitsch, as it's done here. Other weak points are for instance the scenes that were shot, but only were funny for the people who shot them (concerning Toby Maguire). These scenes, were just to long and lost the gag due to that.Overall I'd say not a bad movie and it certainly doesn't need the reviews here to make it's money back. But if this really should be the last, they could've done better! A little less clichés would've been nice too!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

All we need to make a decent spiderman film is Toby McGuire and his brilliant acting as spiderman.. Especially when it comes to this last film of the trilogy. Personally I would say that spiderman 3 is the best spiderman of all and even with the release of a new film out recently, although not having seen it I would still say spiderman 3 will always been the best it is a true masterpiece and had me from giggles to tears and even to the edge of my seat. Another character I was moved by was the acting from his aunt which really made me feel for the character and the loss of her husband. This movie is one of the classics and Toby McGuire is the future of acting, although he now has some competition with actors such as joe lo Trujillo. Venom wasn't a very good addition but I'm sure many other fans such as myself enjoyed sandmans role within spiderman though it wasn't shown much, I'm hoping they make a prequel or a new film about sandman.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Its not just this particular reviewer, in fairness- there are several people here whinging about 3 Villains being 'Too Much' to deal with. Are we suddenly reduced to the attention span of a four year-old due to excessive dumbing down over the past recent years? How on earth did these people cope with X-Men...did they have to take notes??And those who complain about there not being enough ""time generated to allow us to see Harry's transformation into the Goblin' were perhaps buying popcorn or just ""out to lunch"" in the preceding two films...This is, by far, the BEST out of the trilogy. For me - it really consolidated entirely what the Peter Parker ideology was starting to become in the first film, and was first conceived by this classic of all comic stories. It is one manifested by the everyday insecurities, passions and jealousies that we can all empathise with. In this, Toby Maguire perfectly embodies the ambiguity that would arise from being at first vulnerable, and then suddenly imbued with great strength and ability.I don't even have to mention the CGI and general effects...they speak for themselves in their slickness and excellence. What I found more compelling about this film was the fact that the characters weren't so basically aligned towards either Good or Bad - black hats and white hats. It opens up the idea that not every story is the cut and dried truth, and that not everyone who engages in foul play does it merely for their own ends. This allowed for some brilliant performances between the characters played- combined with Sam Raimi's uncanny sense of timing (doubtless honed from his early years). He always keeps you looking over your shoulder, no matter how peaceful and serene a particular scene is at any one time.My only last testimonial is that I even enjoyed Kirsten Dunce in it...and, usually I just CANT stand her!!Enough said.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I really enjoyed the first Spidy film, the second one was disappointing but the trailers of this one looked promising. So I went out on opening night, and as expected the cinema was packedFrom the moment the film began the script was cheesy, worse then your usual Comic book hero and it was cheese through out the entire film. There also seemed to be a lot of jokes added, some good and some very poor.Maguire's Spiderman anger was as painful to watch as Anakin Skywalker's hissy fits in Star Wars, and when (I think) we were meant to be watching the Black Suit taking him over it felt more like we was watching 'The Mask', it was painful to see. Dunst was OK but nothing amazing, usual damsel in distress thing. The love triangle (or square, there was 4 of them!) was weak and I didn't really notice any emotion connection between any of them, the character of Gwen you wouldn't of missed her if she wasn't there. Topher Grace as Eddie was my shining light (I personally feel that he would have been great casting in the role of Spiderman), his anger was a lot more believable then Spidy's despite what little background we had of his reasons and the highlight of the film was watching him as Eddie/Venom. Also James Franco was great as the New Green Goblin, one of the few characters with a back story from previous films. He was far more charming, funny, even angry and entertaining then the other main characters. The 3 bad guys are all played by good actors but Rami was just trying to pack too much in that none of them got a good strong storyline. You feel that Rami was saying 'right this is my last Spidy film let's go out with a bang' but instead it was just a mess of poor jokes, too much CGI and weak characters. (Once the film finished I even checked with the guy sat next to me that we all saw the same poor excuse of a Spiderman film! He agreed.)I give the film 2 stars for its only two stars (shame they didn't have more screen time) Topher Grace and James Franco.Roll on Pirates 3","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I mean in the first one he got a beating from Green Goblin but my God, Venom beat the crap out of him. The one flaw in the movie was that Venom was introduced at the end and Sand-man was a bad guy trying to be good. What's the point of that?

However, when I went back to them i quite enjoyed them. They were, in my opinion, not the best comic book films, but not the worst, either. This one was a disappointment. Not only was it quite boring (the whole film followed the same romance-fight scene-romance sequence) but the villains were unspectacular, and in Venoms case,pointless. This annoyed me in the sense that Venom is one of the most famous villains, and his desperately short screen time disappointed me. Sandman was an interesting character, but not a great enemy. In my opinion it should have been Rino. Peter Parker and Mary Jane are OK characters, but hollow and predictable, even if their acting is top notch. So, I find myself drawn to Harry Osbourne. He is the best character in the film, and his performance is not overdone so is easy to watch. The Directing, is good though, and the fights brilliantly mastered, but few and far between. Bruce Campbell is great in his small part.So, it is OK. May be better as a rental, or if you are a really big fan of the Spiderman series.If you are a fan of Comic adaptations, I recommend the following: Ghost Rider, Batman Returns/Begins, Superman, Blade (1+2), and Fantastic 4 rise of the Silver Surfer.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There is a tremendous amount of story telling mixed in with the superb special effects. The most expensive movie ever made? You can see why. It is a little exhausting to watch at times if you are not a patient movie goer. I think that Sam Raimi has a way of fitting in his comic wit and splicing it with the emotive touch just enough to make the characters seem more viable. Otherwise we could care less about anything but seeing a funny red and blue (or black) suit flying about on screen. The twists and turns and plots jumps can seem to be confusing...and may well be for the young ones, but it is all worth it.

I can't remember many times when there were so many expectations about what a movie should contain, with the movie judged on that. I try to think about objective ways to judge Spidey 3.In general, should a comic book movie be fun? Should it have action and effects? Should it have interesting characters? Should it be Shakespeare? My conclusion is that this movie was fun, had great action, and had interesting characters. Did it have flaws? Sure.It could have been tightened up a little, with some judicious editing.Uh...I can't think of much else that was a real problem, and is not just personal expectation.A villain not getting enough screen time. A problem to some. To me, it worked fine, with a reasonable potential for his return in a future film.Too many villains. A problem to some. To me, I thought it added to the fun. Who would Spider-man have to fight next? I liked the team ups.Silly situations. Well, this is about a comic book hero. To me, it blended humor with drama. It actually had more adult drama, with career disappointments, jealousy, and egotism included. Freud would have loved it.A few too many plot elements. Maybe. I could accept them, even if I really didn't need all of them. A few of them were a stretch, but then real life can be even stranger.Too little character development. To me, this was a non-issue. I didn't need to know all the nuances of each villain. I already know Harry, plus I thought Peter and Mary Jane actually had more depth in their development than in either of the first two movies.Acting. Well I thought Toby thankfully had more to do than just act like a nerdy, shy kid. Kirsten looked strained, but that worked with a person encountering career, self-esteem, and jealousy issues. I think most of the characters worked well with their parts. Were they developed well? I did not need them all developed in-depth. I thought, for instance, that Gwen and Miss Brant were just fine in their parts, with the potential to provide more competition for Mary Jane in the future.Here again, I have heard comments that the movie was stupid. That's astounding considering the number of truly stupid movies I have encountered. I am usually the worst critic. I went in reading reviews and thinking this would be a disappointment. I liked the movie because it doesn't take itself too seriously. It was able take chances and blend humor, drama, and action. I can accept the few minor flaws. I will say that I hope the next Spider-man goes a few different directions with the characters and situations.What else can I say? It blended wonderful, enjoyable silliness, adult issues, and rousing action and effects. It probably lacked the freshness of the original and the technical qualities of the second. For me, it will be remembered as what a good comic book movie should be: Great fun, with surprising depth.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

By all rights this film should have been a very dark and moody affair, especially when Spiderman starts to become 'posessed' by the black suit. Instead what happened was Parker turns into a cheesy EMO kid and the result is somewhat of a joke, rather than being given the seriousness it deserved in terms of psychological inner turmoil... Venom should have had a Golum-like split personality, but even the existence of the symbiote's personality was absent in this film...Which was why Spiderman decided the suit was not for him in the comics...He became aware of its motives and how it was trying to take him over like a parasite, he rejected the suit and then it found a willing partner with Brock because they both hated/resented Parker and Spiderman... Venom should have sounded like some kind of messed up lizard/demon...Instead they just gave him the voice of Brock...Which was really weak. As well, Venom should have been much bulkier and bigger in general...Most of my problems with this film are with the whole 'black suit' thing which they used to advertise this film and it ended up feeling like false advertising...It should have been awesome, but everything about it was cheesy and overacted...There was too much singing and dancing and not enough depth...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If the first two were 9s out of 10, then this is an 8.5. I am not going to talk about the plot, because I don't want to spoil such a fun movie experience for you. In short, this movie has something for everybody.But let me put it this way: it is by far the most ambitious superhero movie I have ever seen, and probably will ever see. Bar none. Were the first two Spidey films better movies? Probably. Were the first two Spidey films more enjoyable movies? Definitely. But, for some reason, I don't have nearly the respect for those movies as I do for Number 3. While the first two films were just mindless action movies (albeit very skilled and very cool ones), Spider Man 3 is a drama first, and an action movie second. Although the action sequences are dazzling and well choreographed, in the end these scenes are overshadowed by the great acting, dialogue, story arc, and charm this film has been so flawlessly infused with. The relationships between the entire ensemble, and the way it affects each character's life, seems much more like Crash than Spider Man 2.The movie is the quintessential guideline for how a movie of its ilk should be made. Its themes of respect, responsibility, forgiveness, and the ability facing oneself are handled so well that they don't seem to belong in a movie of this nature. And in the end, I think that's what turned a lot of viewers off. People will always have an involuntary urge toward complacency. When confronted with something different and more ""out-there"", such as a movie like Spider Man 3, the initial reaction will always be to criticize it, most of the time without exploring the film or their reasons for their dislike of it. And that's a shame. Because, while most of these people are looking for reasons to hate the film, a very good film was blaring right in front of them.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

What a really excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat action-packed sequel! That is the main thing that I can say about SPIDER-MAN 3. Anytime Spider-Man/Peter (Tobey Maguire) was being treated with disrespect, I felt sorry for him. I could particularly relate to how he was feeling at the very beginning of the movie. You'll have to see the movie to know why. When he and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) kissed, I got all warm and tingly inside. I must say that she was a really good singer and actress. Venom (Topher Grace) and Sandman (Thomas Haden Church) really made me jump when they appeared from out of the blue. Now, in conclusion, I recommend this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat action-packed sequel that you'll want to see over and over again to all Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst fans who haven't seen it.

What is the target audience? Twelve year olds? It is so goofy. It is so boring and there's way too much time spent on it. Get over it. The movie bogged down so much without the action sequences. I heard audible sighs from more than one patron and the sighs weren't over the love story. It was exasperation. Even the ending, after the climatic fight scene, was overly long and saccharine. I watched people leave before the end shaking their heads. But on the plus side there were the effects. The Sandman effects were fascinating and the black gooey stuff was good. What happened to the stuff in the lab? That was a bit of a plot hole. The New Goblin fight sequences were exciting and Spiderman's city swinging was fun but again they had to drag Willem Dafoe back into the movie along with the immature Harry Osborn. I'm glad he died since maybe, please, we won't have to go through that story again. The Venom character was good but he was too much. There were too many villains and because of that each one was only superficially developed. The franchise has to move beyond the original story and develop new story lines. It seems difficult for these comic book heroes to move beyond their superficial story lines. Batman is troubled and brooding and you have to watch the moody, pouty scenes. Superman will have some romance with a skinny Lois Lane then some villain will get some kryptonite and trap Superman only for it to be foiled by the villain's moll. Spiderman will appeal to shut-in pre-teens. The plots are predictable and frankly boring. The special effects are the draw and I wish the back stories would just disappear. I enjoyed Hellboy but expect a sequel to repeat lots of the original story. I rate this movie low because too much of it was saccharine hand holding and repetition of the original movie. The action was fun but too interrupted by sentimentality.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first two were excellent and helped, perhaps, pull more people toward the comic book world. Number 2, in particular, was astonishingly good in that we got to see how much Spidey had to give up in order to be the man he had to be. And with the mondo-budget given to this third film (something like $250 million, I believe, which was only recently eclipsed by the $300 million PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END), one would suspect that it would hold onto its previous successes by following a somewhat similar format.But no...Although loaded with action and some top-notch special effects, the film is overloaded with too many characters and some unwontedly bad scenes that were in need of excision.This time Spider-Man (Tobey Maguire, THE GOOD German) is up against not one, not two, not three, but four evil forces. Although this sounds enticing, there's no way (NO WAY!) anything approaching cohesion could happen for this 139 minute film: an evil, outerspace symbiote that attaches itself to Spidey's suit; Green Goblin Jr./Harry Osborn, played by the returning James Franco (TRISTAN & ISOLDE); Sandman/Flint Marko played by Thomas Haden Church (CHARLOTTE'S WEB); and, eventually, Venom/Eddie Brock, played by Topher Grace.I'm not sure what Mr. Raimi was thinking, but more is not necessarily ""more,"" if you catch my meaning. Audiences don't need impossible odds to enjoy a hero's journey into darkness and back; we just need a good story that holds together.Oh, and we definitely don't need a woosie Spider-Man crying in every other scene. The guy's a superhero, make him act like one for crying out loud! It's still nice to see the beautiful Kirsten Dunst (ELIZABETHTOWN) in her role as Mary Jane the love interest. She can act well and she's believable in every scene, it just that she gets lost amongst the overly crowded cast, too, just like the Sandman and Venom do.Too many questions about what's happening plague the middle of the film but are wrapped up in slipshod fashion at the very rushed ending.It isn't all bad, though. The scenes with Spider-Man and Sandman together are shot well, with the special effects taking center-stage more than the story or the actors themselves. The death of a pivotal character is handled well but, again, the tears are overdone and make Spidey look wimpish.Perhaps the next Spider-Man film will help put this one behind us as ""the bad one."" We can all hope that Mr. Raimi gets back to doing character shots that help strengthen our superhero rather than making him appear like a crybaby.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's poorly written: bloated, episodic, repetitive and, yet, sill manages to leave some matters unexplained or unresolved. In the beginning, it feels as though it were merely a victory lap for the filmmakers after the first two movies, with Manhattan celebrating Spiderman and awarding him with the Key to the City. There's some manufactured drama for Peter and Mary Jane's relationship revolving around her supposedly-newfound inability to act. I mean, wasn't that obvious after each time we saw her perform in ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" in ""Spider-Man 2"" she flubbed her lines. Now, she's obviously lip syncing songs. I'm not surprised she's fired. Anyways, the screenplay, perhaps, could've done something interesting with the notion of Spidey being a more-successful performer in his heroism than Mary Jane is with her acting on stage, but that whole thread is basically abandoned by the end of the movie.Instead, we get more of Green Goblin Jr. and that love triangle/revenge storyline. Plus, Spidey gets two more supervillains on top of that. The Sandman puts me to sleep. I almost didn't notice that his storyline is never resolved. So what of his daughter, then? And Venom seems monotonous since we just saw Peter fighting the same virus off himself after it had turned him--laughably--emo. Moreover, how does Venom know about the Sandman and his daughter and so seek him out in the first place? And, come to think of it, why does Venom--seemingly knowingly--call Spidey by the same pet name, ""tiger,"" that Mary Jane used last movie? Or how convenient is it that the butler finally tells Harry what he should've told him two movies ago? This thing needed more rewrites, to clear the cobwebs away.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Since I was a little kid, I always wanted to see my favorite comic character, Venom, on the silver screen, and I finally got my chance. I had almost no issues with this movie. People's main complain was the transition between action and story, in which we see the battles of Spider-Man, and the love life of Peter Parker being interchanged in the story, but most these film critics haven't bothered to read a Spider-Man comic ever, I wager, because that is exactly how the comics went. Spider-Man 3 leaves us at a decided end, so help it that the filmmakers no longer wish to continue, but its already been called for Spider-Man 4. Finishing some story lines set from deep within the first movie, and leaving possibility's for new ones, Spider-Man 3 does its job better than well, and the third time must be the charm, because the echo's of Peter Parker's Uncle Ben saying ""With Great Power, Comes Great Responsibility"" is never truer in Spider-Man 3. The movie has one on the edge of their seats, and with something for everyone, with more special effects than before, tons of true-to-the-comic stories for nerds like myself, a great story, which leave one for the next story in not only the test-proved greatest comic book movie, but another epic story in the life of Peter Parker, also known as the Amazing Spider-Man","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I also thought he could use some work on his acting. My wife was exasperated by the fact that a big-budget movie with so many stars (i.e. James Franco) would then pay such a low-rent actor to play the part of the butler who then had to tell a story about cleaning James Franco's father's wound.

While the first one was OK, the second one was much better but not fantastic. Spider-man 3? Was a pure ABOMINATION!! Where to begin? For starters, having 3 different villains was a bad idea. Even worse was having one of those villains suddenly become a good guy at the last minute. (Because of a confession from a Butler who was not present in either of the first two films yet supposedly cleaned Norman Osbourne's wounds and ""analyzed the wounds for metal fragments"" and compared them with the Goblin Glider, which was nowhere near the Osbourne mansion. And how many Butlers do you know moonlight as Criminalists? i don't recall seeing him on CSI: NY) That element was STUPID!!!! Spiderman's cocky attitude was just sickening. Even before the Symbiote came into play. It was made worse after he became ""Black Spidey"" and the aggression of the suit turned him into an older looking version of Edward Furlong as he appeared in Terminator 2: Judgement Day. And the dancing? Seriously? WHO DOES THAT? What comic book did the writers ever read that had a hero aimlessly dancing through the streets of their cities? I thought Spiderman the musical was on Broadway, not worming it's way onto the big screen. The Symbiote Suit.... ahhh the suit. It looked horrible. How hard is it to animate an all black suit with one big white insignia? The original Spiderman Symbiote suit looked amazing. Why did Rami feel the need to change it? While Rami's version didn't look too bad on Spidey himself, it absolutely did not work for Venom. Which brings me to my next beef. Eddie Brock/Venom. Topher Grace was hardly the ideal choice for this role. Visually, he was not at all convincing. Eddie Brock in the comics and the cartoon was a bulky guy who could bench at least 400 lbs without the Symbiote. And Topher Grace in his 180 pound (max)body was supposed to be that guy? Topher in the Venom suit, was pathetic. Venom is one of the scariest villains in the Spiderman Universe, if not the entire Marvel universe. Why could we hear Topher's sarcastic tenor voice while Brock was in the Venom suit as opposed to a much deeper, heavier, raspy growl? It didn't work at all. Topher was not menacing nor scary in the least bit. Why was Brock's face shown so much while in the Venom suit? In the show and comics, Brock was supposed to be completely subdued while Venom was in control yet he kept rearing his head and showing his face? It didn't work AT ALL!!! Sandman's story was a stretch. How realistic is it that new evidence regarding Uncle Ben's murder surfaces years later, yet there were no witnesses when the investigation first went underway? Considering that the crook that Robbed the fight promoter actually thanked Peter in the first film, does narrowly support the scenario of Uncle Ben's death in the third film. But very Narrowly, considering how many people in NYC would put their own necks on the line for a friend? In other words, if the crook that Spidey chased in the first film was doing a favor for a friend, why was he the point man? Why did he have the money when Spidey ended up chasing him? Why was the man who had the motive acting as the lookout? The story was a stretch. The action during the first fight between Spidey and New Goblin was impressive and very well done. But not enough to redeem the overall quality of the film. Mary Jane once again ending up being held captive by the film's main villain is more than old; it's stupid! you'd think by, the girl would have learned a thing or two. The only other redeeming quality of the movie was J.K. Simmons. He was hilarious as always. With the exception of James Franco, the acting of the cast was also dumbed down when compared with the other films. (Which tends to be a trend with Triologies. Every seems to ""lazy-up"" with their acting by the third film.) Overall, I did not enjoy the film. And while their are other bad films that I find entertaining (Such as ""Daredevil"" or ""The Last Sentinel"") that I can watch multiple times, I've only seen this film once and have NO desire to see it again.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film's become much longer, indeed bloated, the action sequences become fewer and attempts at often campy but unfunny humour intrude. That's not all that's wrong with this movie. The SFX are not of the best quality, an important piece of Spidey history gets re-written, as Uncle Ben gets murdered again, but this time by a different guy who of course, morphs into our hero's latest home-town super- villain plus there are just too many villains competing to down the web-slinger. Between Venom, The Hobgoblin (or the New Goblin as he's termed here) and Sandman, too many crooks definitely spoil the broth.Peter Parker's on-off romance with Kirsten Dunst's rather dismal Mary Jane Parker trundles on too and of course he has his usual existential crisis triggered this time by being taken over by an alien micro-organism which twists his mind but for some reason has a weakness for loud clanging noises. The plot too seems borrowed from ""Superman 2"" meets Star Wars as Spider Man gets in touch with his bad self, losing his popularity and his girl as he does so. Throw in a lame attempt at humour which sees Pete come over all John Travolta and yet another unnecessary Stan Lee cameo and you can see why this seems to me by far the weakest entry in the franchise so far.I don't know the exact reasons why Marvel chose to reboot Spider Man after this admittedly very successful entry, at least judging by its box-office returns, but the signs of wear are there. I just found the endless shots of the expressionless faces of Maguire and Dunst only added to the tedium, the former only occasionally gets into costume and finally who was it who put the title end sequence at the start of the movie, holding up proceedings interminably it seemed.I've still to watch the most recent remake of the title character but hope it manages to spin back to the promise of the first film of this particular three.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There was no real plot. The nonsensical plot lines; seemed like there were a hundred or so, just made this silly. The way this film seemed to veer, the average joe or criminal can gain super powers just by walking out the door. This was just a very silly film that was just made to bring the spiderman brand some built in bucks. The special effects were fine, thus the 2 stars. This project was an insult to my intelligence and just another disrespectful film fed to the masses with little care for the consumer. The acting was fine , though Spiderman was made into an egotistical , unlikable young man. Kirsten Dunst was whiny most of the film. Save your 2 plus hours .","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is by far one of the best blockbuster films this Summer. Staying true to the comic book series, this film has it all. Maguire, Dunst, Franco, and Simmons reprise their roles as well as guest appearances by Willem Dafoe and the co-creator Stan Lee himself. Sam Raimi isn't just one of the greatest film directors in the motion picture industry... but also a great screenwriter. Action, comedy, suspense and awesome visual effects make this picture a must-have for all Marvel comic book fans.If you get the 2-disc set or Blu-ray disc, you'll get to see more visual effects, on-location settings and more. If you get the stand alone DVD, shame on you. Overall, I rate Spider-Man 3 on DVD an amazing 9 out of 10! EXCELSIOR!!!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

SM2 was maybe the best superhero film of all time (if it isn't, only Superman 2 is better), and the promise of Venom had me unable to wait for this flick. Then I saw it opening day. It's like they took all the flaws from the first two and left out the good parts. Peter Parker's efforts to cope with his powers always set the comics apart from the comics at the time. Here, Raimi jumps the shark and makes the boy emo. How is any intelligent person supposed to take emo seriously? Gwen Stacy, a very important figure in the comics, is reduced to minimal screen time and few lines. I don't even read comics, and I know she's significant. That's an indicator you should probably give the lady some lines.The main villain is Sandman, a misunderstood criminal who has maybe the least scary powers ever. Oh no, it's the Sandman! He's gonna get stuck in my crack! Sandman is played by Thomas Haden Church, who actually gives the part the depth and feeling that should have been given to Peter Parker. James Franco is back as Pete's former best friend Harry, and it's painfully obvious that Franco pushed that part as far as it could go in the last film. Venom is reduced to about 15 minutes of screen time, which is the greatest travesty of the film. Venom is the greatest of all Spidey villains. Topher Grace doesn't have enough time to build up Eddie Brock or his fiendish alter-ego, making him yet another victim of the film's bloating.Venom's not the only bad villain. The New Goblin, Harry Osbourne's vengeful alter-ego, is a mess. Harry, who would have failed out of high school without Peter's help, somehow managed to build an all-new array of weapons and suits. Okey-dokey. As I understand it, the substance that he took to gain the Goblin's heightened strengths also increased his intelligence, but I don't know for sure because it wasn't explained. Next, he doesn't wear a mask. James Francois not menacing in any way, shape, or form. It's such a great irony that the animated Willem Dafoe was restricted by a mask yet James Franco gets to show his pretty mug. He bore almost no resemblance to the Green Goblin, and his weapons were over the top even for a superhero film.Here's a bit of advice: don't hire good performers like Topher Grace, Bryce Dallas Howard, and James Cromwell (who plays Gwen's dad), and then not let them develop their characters. Don't interpret the mood swings and aggressiveness brought on by the black suit as emo. Most importantly, don't put a dance number in a superhero blockbuster. I hope they fix these bugs in time for Spidey 4. Sony, let this be a lesson not to go crazy just because a franchise is successful.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Spidey franchise takes a cue from 1983's heavily underrated ""Superman III"" by making the hero go bad. This time, it's thanks to black alien goo and the results involve neither the Leaning Tower of Pisa nor the Olympic Torch. Spidey dons a black suit and styles his hair in the emo fashion before strutting down the street like a '70s-flick gigolo, winking and snapping at girls as he goes along. Harry (also the Hobgoblin here) dances, MJ (Kirsten Dunst, still without acting lessons) sings, and Topher Grace (as Peter's rival photographer Eddie Brock) prays to God for the death of Parker. However, the film actually rises above its two predecessors by keeping the drama (however overdone) above cheap 3-D thrills. Several of the gags are quite memorable, and it's always fun to see Spidey in action. Good or evil, Tobey Maguire still wears the suit well after five years.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film starts off great, but just sort of becomes unwieldy towards the end. One can almost tell when the film takes a turn for the worse.The appearance of the ooze didn't seem to make much sense in the context of the film. Okay, I know that it was supposed to create a doppleganger effect with Peter, but at least they could have done it consistently. In the comics, the suit had a mind of its own, and that really wasn't fleshed out here until the suit attaches itself to Eddie Brock. In the movie, it was almost like Peter had a black suit fetish and turned bad because of it, versus the suit exerting its will on the host. This should have been made more clear in the film. It also would have warranted more sympathy for Peter if the film performed this differently. As it is, Peter is just someone pretending to be bad with a suit fetish.This inconsistency among others (the general lack of spider sense throughout the film, for example) is what took me out of the film. I'm not against adding villains if it means that it enhances the drama, but in this case, adding the villains didn't do much but overwhelm the film to the point where it's almost incomprehensible. I find the last hour of the film almost unwatchable because of this.The next Spider-man film will no doubtedly have Marvel Studios in full control. I wish they would do what they did to the Hulk, and pretend the Venom never existed in this one. A Venom reboot, if you will. I truly believe that if you dedicate your movie to just that one character alone as the villain, it will have more dramatic gravitas than all three villains have garnered in this film combined. Make it so, Marvel!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This time Spidey takes on three adversaries - unfortunately it all gets somewhat downtrodden in background stories and set-up together with his alter-ego's ongoing romance. It all starts blissfully enough with Peter and MJ together on top of the world - Spiderman has now been officially accepted as a hero and MJ has landed a promising singing job. Unfortunately, this makes Peter somewhat selfish, concentrating mainly on his own achievements and not realising what is going on around him. In comes the first foe then the next and things go south from there for him to the inevitable climax. Regrettably, this movie is trying to cramp too much information into its two and a half hours, making it rather slow and despondent at times. The action scenes - far and few between - are as good as ever though and well worth seeing. Sadly, while the set-ups are there, it is somewhat ambiguous at best.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There would be several ""boob shots"" and at least two bareknuckle boxing scenes in every chick flick.

But for me i am really disappointed. Spiderman never had this much drama, 60% of all these movies are Peter parker talking about Mary jane and the drama around them. They should be more about peter as a scientist figuring out stuff about villains and getting in all sorts of trouble with other villains on the way. But no everything is about Mary jane. i seriously thought after watching the second one that nothing could make me watch the next one, i was wrong.When i saw they where making a Spiderman movie with Venom ( my all time favorite villain) The first thing i thought was '' oh sweet Jesus they better not screw this up, movie wont be that good but how can they make venom look bad? I was wrong AGAIN, Venom used to be this huge Bad ass with a really monstrous threatening voice. Even Eddie brock used to be a big strong badass. But in the MOVIE he is a skinny white dude..... i then thought it couldn't possibly get any worse, yes it did. Venom had lost his monstrous voice, instead there was a skinny white dude with a girlish accent talking for him with a weird sound in the background....even Venom was small and skinny. Come on.Also where are all the other villains? Kingpin for example? spiderman is supposed to be with super villains around every corner, Where is Black Cat? He wasn't with mary jane for so long he had other relationships. I also don't like the actor who plays spiderman at all, He is so far from Peter parker. I really can go on and on of things that bug me about this movie but i did see some good things too. The director clearly loves Sandman and Green goblin. I thought those stories where put out quite nicely and i liked the suspense between harry and peter. Other than that i think this movie is okay for a drama movie...but its just not the real Spiderman in all his Glory.

In contrast with the critics who didn't like the film because of too many plot lines, too many villains, and just too long, I have to disagree with them.Yeah, I believe it was too long but I really thought it was great for them to make more plot lines to finally solve the sub plots from the last 2 movies. And I love the fact that there are more villains, which means more action. The action scenes are very good in the film, as you can suspect. You can feast your eyes on the fantastic visuals from the beginning credits to the last battle scene at the end. Oh, and it's darker meaning the small family film from the first two movies is gone. It's more adultish right now.One problem with the movie is that the pacing is too fast. It's the beginning of the movie and about 10 minutes later, there's a huge fight sequence. Yeah, I like that but there are a lot of action in this movie. I also didn't like the fact that most of the characters of the film is changed. Their personalities had changed. Mary Jane isn't the sweet girl anymore and so on...As you can also suspect, there are the cameos from Stan Lee and Bruce Campbell, which surprisingly both have a longer screening time and actually has talking roles, well, for Stan Lee and a longer talking role for Bruce Campbell. The acting by Tobey Maguire was decent but nothing great like the second one.This film is already a box office hit and you might as well see it to participate in the film's breaking record in the box office.

Sam Raimi got 3 years to finish the trilogy and everybody was expecting the ""big show"", ""the best one"", ""the golden key""... so, everybody was expecting so much and then he brings a mess.The resumé of the story is simple, fragile and interesting: Peter Parker starts liking his suite more than ever. He knows how to live his personal life with his super-hero's obligations but he's starting to forget who he really is. That's a simple plot like the first 2 movies and it starts well till the audience see that it's not simple like that.The mess starts with the visual effects. They are the worse of entire trilogy! It's so plastic, so unnatural... I mean... it blows on your eyes that it's truly fake that even Hulk looks better. It's not something like X-Men: The Last Stand, that you see and think: ""Wow, this visual effects are great!"" but, yes, ""WOW, THIS VISUAL DEFECTS ARE GREAT!"". Too much chroma key, even at unnecessary moments. So, if should be like this, why Tobey and Kirsten are still being cast! Let's just make a CGI Spider Man movie! Final Fantasy shown us that this is a possible thing.Then, the camera: Sometimes things are too fast, lot of CGI scenes, so much action and movements making you lose points and focus. You get dizzy, everything is dark to make a camouflage over the CGI imperfections and finally... you see anything. It's something like throwing a magazine in a liquidizer, that's what the movie is all about sometimes.And now, the final point: Too many villains. Too many stories. I think that Sam Raimi was so desperate to put all together just for the pleasure of the fans that he made real mistakes here. 1) all the stories loses its focus; 2) people was expecting an entire movie just about Sandman, or Venom, or the Green Goblin's return.The movie goes slowly 'till its final part, then everything happens fast enough. I can see Sam Raimi at the editing room: ""OMG, 120 minutes have been edited and... where's the action??? I had 3 years of my life to make this but I could only find the right color for the black suite now, so, everything needs to be done until tomorrow morning because Saturday is the premiere! C'mon everybody, fast! Fast! FAST!"".Why should you see: well, it's the end the trilogy... if you already saw the first 2, why not this one?The best part: Stan Lee camel.What I really think: Spider-Man is done. Sam Raimi should move to other projects, he's a great director, but he seems kinda tired of so much spiderwebs.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Venom looks much cooler then the actor. Spiderman himself.. Amazin.. THe did a better job with him in this movie then in the others. Black suit was perfect. Looked great.

"10","/10","Spider-Man 3 is a great movie despite heavy criticism","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1652208/?ref_=tt_urv","jbyrd-9","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15278111/?ref_=tt_urv","8 May 2007","In my opinion Spider-Man 3 is a fantastic movie even though it falls short of the greatness that was Spider-Man 2. If Spider-Man 3 was released ahead of its predecessors as the first Spider-Man it would not have had to deal with such heavy criticism and would have gotten better reviews from the critics. However since this movie is the third installment of the Spider-Man trilogy it had to live up to the greatness that was Spider-Man 2. Therefore the main reason I have decided to even post a comment about this movie is to 1.) Help those who haven't seen the movie get an idea of how great the movie is despite its flaws, and 2.) Rebut other people's views about what was wrong with the movie. A movie is never going to satisfy everyone, and because of that people are going to have complaints. I would first like to address the complaints about this movie being too crammed with plots, characters, and so on. This is true, to a degree. One of the things that helped make the first two Spider-Man movies so great was the fact that they could end the movie with some unanswered questions, there was no need to tie up all the loose ends because the next movie would do that. However Spider-Man 3, which is suppose to be the final Spider-Man, movie had the weight of all the unanswered questions from the first two movies which needed to be answered in this final installment. Not only does Spider-Man 3 have to tie up all the loose ends from the previous movies but it also introduces 2 new villains, a new pretty girl, Peter Parker personal demons, plus competition at the Daily Bugle. With all that said it sounds like too much right??? Wrong!!! It's almost too much. Although this movie does have a lot going on, director Sam Raimi does a fantastic job of juggling all the plots, characters, and action sequences to allow for everything to tie together beautifully in the end. I personally would rather have a movie that had a lot going on in it than not enough. I have been to movies where I felt that there wasn't enough going on and wished that they had error on the side of putting too much into the movie than not enough. Regardless Spider-Man 3 sets the bar for how much you can stuff into a movie and still have it be a great movie.On another note some even feel that some of the characters in the movie (like Venom) needed more time to develop. Ironically those who I have heard complain about there not being enough character development are those who are die hard Spider-Man fans and already know everything there is to know about the characters. These people are being picky and unreasonable. If you wanted more in depth character development you are looking at splitting Spider-Man 3 (which remember is ""suppose"" to be the last one) into two movies rather than just the one, and I'm willing to bet that if they did split Spider-Man 3 into two different movies someone would be complaining that they could have combined the two movies into one. For those who are unaware of the characters prior to watching the movie or those who have never read a Spider-Man comic book, there is plenty of character development for every character in the movie. Now could there have been more character development, Yes, but there doesn't need to be more character development not only because of time constraints of how long a movie is expected to be but also because it would simply be a waste of time. Yes Spider-Man 3, even though a great movie just how it is, could have lived up to the high expectations from movie critics by ousting either the Sandman or Venom which would have given more time to the villain kept, however director Sam Raimi isn't as concerned about the critics as he is the fans. Director Sam Raimi was NOT even going to have Venom in this movie; however the pressure from the big wigs over him kept pushing for Venom to be in the movie because of the loyal fans out there that wanted to see Venom on the silver screen. Lets just say for the sake of arguing that one of the villains was omitted from the movie. I personally feel that the movie would have had the ""been there done that"" feeling with just the one bad guy. Spider-Man fighting just one villain again would have been too mundane for me. Not only would it have been too mundane but it only seems logical that after the first two villains failed at beating Spidey one on one, that the next super-villain would want to out number Spidey to increase their odds of winning. Plus I sometimes like it when the odds are heavily against the super hero but yet the hero finds a way to prevail. Now I could go on and on about how this movie has been unfairly judged but I will save you, the reader, the time and just tell you that the plots the characters, basically everything in the movie (despite some rushed CGI animation which all together is fantastic)is still solid and Spider-Man 3 is definitely worth seeing.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

It was not so because it didn't have riveting action or moments of comedic levity as was the case in the prior two Spidermans. Its just with all the story lines going on nothing really came together. Just as you were about ready to get into this movie it jerks you away and throws you into another storyline. Spider-man was an A-Rated franchise but this last installment reminds me of those lesser comic book films like...the Phantom or the Shadow that were alright but never good enough for a sequel.It was very obvious that the studio factor was weighing in on this film. And this time the cash hungry executives said, ""To heck with a sensible story; instead, lets rev up the marketing on this celluloid cash cow. Lets keep every gimmick of the first two films in play, even though they really don't belong; while overplaying the romantic nonsense of boy catches girl, boy looses girl, boy ends up with best friend of boy, best friend turns out to be a bigger jerk, boy gets girl back. And because people do eventually tire of franchises after the third film lets jam-pack this movie with all the villains and subplots, and get all of the money out of it now. Of course any serious character development or finer plot details will have to be scrapped because there simply won't be any-time."" Geeze studio guys with all the extra junk, there was barely any time to actually see the real (Red & Blue) Spider-Man in action with his mask on. I mean 3/4 of the time Spider-Man is either with out his mask or its torn to shreds. What is in Tobey McGuires' contract; that there has to be so much face time? I mean its great to establish the humanity side of Spider-man but Tobey and the director, Sam Raimi, has really taken it too far and has made him into a....sissy boy.Bottom line is there is entertainment value to be had with this film. Heck its better than most shows on the networks. (TV is dumb, except for HOUSE) With that said, however,Spider-man 3 is just such the expected disappointment that I was hoping it would not be.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Those who haven't been Spidey fans their whole lives will find the movie to be corny, and at times downright trite.

The film labors through a series of shallow subplots that converge only artificially through a series of ho-hum coincidences, such as the physical proximity of the characters.This style of plot mingling may be suitable for the superhero comic book, where the dearth of text restricts the story line to the role of showcasing the fantastic powers of the characters in a two-dimensional extravaganza of special effects. The theme of superhero comic books has also traditionally centered on a predictable pattern: the triumph of good over evil as played out on the battlefield of human vs. inhuman motivations.As a mere recreation of a comic book, perhaps Spider-Man 3 succeeds. One certainly has the feeling on several occasions while watching the movie of being inside a comic book. However, a film can aspire to more. The best of the comic book movies, including the first two Spider-Men and the first two X-Men movies, show how it is possible to recreate the camp and atmospherics of a comic book, and even its unique flavor of suspension of disbelief, without sacrificing the strengths of the filmic medium, such as narrative complexity and visual suspense.The acting appears to be a casualty mostly of character development, which is a casualty in turn of the plot. The characters are asked to be puppets of petty motives and capricious plot turns ,such as bumps on the head, greed for fame (on Spiderman's part!), and vengefulness blown out of proportion. The actors dutifully and competently played their parts. The plot let them down. Call back Michael Chabon.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Sam Raimi, no doubt now one of the most empowered directors in Hollywood, has really been let to indulge himself with this one. But though the movie seems to really lag in places, the result is that there's no skimping on character development. We've already got to know most of the characters over the last two movies but it's good to see further development, especially for Mary-Jane who has evolved over the three movies, and Dunst is magnetic with the role. Toby McGuire IS Spiderman as usual and takes the new developments with the character in his stride.We could have done with less Sandman, more Venom. Though we get to know Eddie Brock very well, Venom was very under-utilized.The movie doesn't seem to have the same sense of wonder as the previous two, but that seems fitting with the theme as it is more introspective. The ending seemed to abrupt, but at least ties up all the story arches.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The second one was probably the best film based on a comic book character ever made. This one: I think the word is over the top. Don't get me wrong it's a fun night out but half way through the film new threads of the plot line were opening up and I was wondering how long it would take to tie up all the loose ends. I remember feeling that way three ours into Return of the King but that was after some 11 hours of film and character and story development. And to be honest Spidey is not worth the complexity.If it wasn't because by the end of Spider-Man 2 I had come to admire this franchise so much, my rating would not be so negative. This time though I felt that the writers were too worried they would not manage to sign up the main actors to make three more films so they squeezed three major plot lines into one film. This is Spider 3-4-5 and none of them are very good.They look fantastic though.And no one screams like Kirsten Dunst. Even if Peter Parker's eyes may wander sometimes, his ears are hooked for good.There was a high-brow filmic tribute in the film. The crucial turning of the story when Peter Parker realises he needs to tear himself away from the alien symbion stuck to him that is bringing out his dark side, makes him a great jazz/tango dancer and hit his girlfriend across her pretty face. He's helped by coincidence. It is fortunate that he happens to be on top of a church tower when he literally stumbles on the knowledge that the resonance of the ringing bell annoys the symbion stuck to him. The view down from the tower (and the view up from the bottom as seen by one of Spidey's many nemeses) is not too vaguely reminiscent of the church tower in Hitchcock's Hispanic church tower in Vertigo. Looks good too.The real tribute in the film is given in the other cameo appearance: the one by Stan Lee, the creator of this most real of comic book super heroes.Well Sam Raimi seems to have been overwhelmed by the oft repeated line: 'with great power comes great responsibility'. The end of Spider-Man 2 gave Raimi the responsibility of delivering yet again the 'best comic book movie ever made' and sadly the aim was so high overshooting was almost inevitable.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There are just too many good, complex heroes and villains from the Marvel Universe to cram into two and a half hours of film. Gwen Stacy was hardly given the time she was due and I doubt anyone will remember Dr. Curt Connors (Peter's science teacher, who also turns into a villain in the comics). Sandman hardly gets enough time either, but at least we end up feeling sympathetic to the guy in the end (although that's about all he gets). But those characters that Raimi is able to bring to life certainly pick up the slack. Kirsten Dunst portrays a very deeply hurt Mary Jane very well, James Franco's New Goblin/Harry Osborn is as torn as ever (but surprised me in the end), and Tobey Maguire still is lovable in a nerdy way as he portrays Peter/Spidey. The ending made up for all the lost opportunities Raimi had during the film. Walking out of the theater, I felt my five dollar matinée fee was well spent.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The fight sequences in S-2 looked realistic. The fight scenes in S-3 look not realistic but graphical mistakes. Plus the speed of the first fight scene might make you think whether the scene is too fast or there is some problem with your eyes.In the end, there is again the emotional hue and cry to end what is a 150 minutes long boredom.

It seems that the script was written without so much thinking! The movie is really good when it comes to action scenes. The parts which Sandman fights Spider Man are great in terms of visual effect and editing. The scene which he is ""born"" was mesmerizing and even touching. In fact, that scene was unusual for such a movie. It was pure art. As for the flaws, the metamorphosis of Spider-Man and the genesis of Venom weren't handled well. The screen times of Venom and black Spider Man were short. I don't know is it necessary to say that the actor who plays Venom was a ridiculous choice! In the comic book, as I remember, after his costume gets black, Spider-Man realizes that he has some new powers. Then, he gives some of their enemies hard time. When he sees that it is evil and controls him, he tries to get rid of it. The black substance comes to the earth by a spaceship, it infects to it, but nobody realizes. And after an accident, it finds Spider-Man. The change of Peter Parker is mentioned by two ridiculous and pointless scenes; the bar scene and the street scene that Peter Parker dances! He looks untroubled, no anxiousness etc. It is like the movie makes fun of itself or Raimi makes fun of his own movie! Raimi decreases action scenes as much as he can, because, in these years, this is the trend! Less action, much drama, focus on characters instead! However, still the movie is satisfying as an action and as said very entertaining, it has demo scenes. The movie was not slow paced, but it suffered from less action, more drama and humor syndrome at times. And may be the final action was a bit lame! Some people glorify J. K. Simmons's performance, but if you ask me, his acting was overdone. He cannot make us believe that he is J. Jonah Jameson, he tries to be like J. Jonah Jameson. In other words, it is like he imitates that character, so cartoonish. Some visual effects are flawed, especially the scene which Peter Parker fights Harry Osborn at night and the scene which Spider and Sandman fights in the metro. In the first fight, two foes fight without mask which is also the reason of bad CGI and also a bad idea! Also, there are some seriously illogical moments in this fight which a human being cannot survive. We get bored of the routine accident scenes and especially Mary Jane in danger moments. The killer of Ben Parker is far fetched and even ridiculous. In the final sequence, there are also some very illogical moments which Sam Raimi call as ""comic book reality"" such as Sandman's impacts or the sticks trick.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

More than anything because with this film could be organized a similar contest, but would be called the strongest rival. It would gain who could take more time viewing this infection without leaving the room.The film is clearly divided into two very differentiated parts; A first half boring, dull and with an argument more proper of a soap opera than a Marvel comic. The second half is directly an insult, an unworthy, soulless and unbearable garbage.At the same height as Sidney Furie's ""Superman IV: The Quest of Peace"" (1987) and Joel Schumacher's ""Batman & Robin"" (1997), Sam Raimi is dedicated to giving us a script that kicks up to the balls the original Spider- man comic and that reduces the characters to simple puppet theaters of themselves. There are times when I have come to ask if it was not before a gross parody, because what I saw could not really be serious.If the script is bad, it is also possible to speak about performance and direction. From the first it all boils down to the following: many characters, little history, little psychological depth and the end result: insensitive performances at best (James Franco), mostly inconsequential (Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, James Cromwell, Bryce Dallas Howard) and wicked in the couple protagonist. From the direction, nothing at all, camera movements at all rags, a lot of video clip, paste some American flags that are always grateful and waste millions of dollars in digital effects copied from ""The Mummy"".In short, a debacle in the whole rule. Not that the previous deliveries were wonderful, but they maintained a certain dignity, characteristic that Sam Raimi has lost in filming this, and still to continue charging. If he had a modicum of decency, he should retire from the cinema, only to not continue to offend his own legacy and above all because of the offense that has caused Spider-Man fans.The best: Now ""The Ghost Rider"" seems to me in comparison, a masterpiece. The worst: So much promotion for this? Shame!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Spidey-fans will love all the subtle nuances, of course Stan Lee, however this film gives to the Sam Raimi fans as well. In addition the support cast is spectacular J.K. Simmons, Bryce Dallas Howard, James Cromwell and even Dylan Baker add to the story telling giving more depth and play-ability to the adventure. A touch on the kind side in places I believe that is one of the changes that breathes life into this film and helps progress, it also gives us true development which was clearly lacking in Spider-Man 2 The visual effects absolutely steal the show, not just the Venom effects that are stunning, but the Sandman visuals are truly inspired. We have seen sand move before, this time we get to see it move with style, grace and economy of motion. The one drawback to this film is that for some reason Spider-Man, Venom, and Sandman all think we want to see their faces  and honestly, I do not. The title of the film is Spider-Man 3 not Tobey Maguire in a Spider-Man costume 3 . Moreover, really who cares that Topher Grace is Venom, let the symbiote take him over and let us think no more of that 70's show So go and enjoy this film just remember that every time you see Toby's face Stan Lee has to be cringing with the rest of us.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Could've been spectacular but ended up being a bloated mess","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1962303/?ref_=tt_urv","MF210","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2368825/?ref_=tt_urv","18 October 2008","My Rating: ** out of ****.Maybe Spider-Man 3 is the product of huge expectations, maybe even unreasonably so, but it is a massive disappointment. Sam Raimi was crafting one of the better super hero franchises, the first one was solid and the second one was one was outstanding. The trailers for the third film showed promise and there was a ton of potential, hardly any of which was realized in the final product.The biggest problem with the film was Sam Raimi was just attempting way too much with the storyline. Not only is the film about Peter and MJ's relationship, which is in full blown soap opera mode, but it's also about Peter's conflicts with Harry, Peter/Spider-Man's ""dark side"", which is introduced by some mysterious black goo from outer space, and two other villains are thrown in for good measure. Needless to say Spider-Man 3 is a bloated mess.One of the trademarks of the previous two film were the quality of the villains. Willem Defoe was very effective as the Green Goblin and Alred Molina was outstanding as Doc Ock, both were menacing and, even if they had there complexities, you had no problem rooting against them. That is a problem here. If you're counting all the vaillains in the film there is three: Harry, Sandman, and Venom. The fight scenes between Peter/Spidey and Harry are energetic and some of the most effective in the film, but James Franco is not intimidating enough to be a good villain, and by the end of the film he is no longer a villain.The other two villains are both failures for different reasons. Thomas Haden Church plays Sandman, who we learn was responsible for the death of Peter's Uncle Ben in the first films, and he ends up being the most sympathetic character in the film. Give credit to Church for making us feel for the character but that doesn't make him a very good villain. Sandman's name is Flint Marko and he shows to regret his past actions and wants to help his sick daughter. Not everything he does is right but it's hard to hate him.The biggest failure is how Raimi just decides to trash Venom. Not only is Topher Grace seriously miscast as Eddie Brock/Venom but the character is unforgivably shortchanged. The character has only 20-30 minutes of screen time and Brock doesn't become Venom till the very end. This is one of the most popular villains in the comics and cartoons and the filmmakers hardly use him? I'm baffled by their apporach. At least you can say he looks good but there's no doubt Venom deserved to be a stand alone villain in another film.The trailers showed that the film was going to focus on the dark side of Peter and Spider-Man. This potentially fascinating element is, with a few eceptions, executed poorly. The black goo that was previously mentioned attaches itself to Peter and changes his mood,appearance and creates a black Spidey suit. His appearance is ridiculously emo with black hair and an angsty facial expression. He also acts like a fool dancing on the streets, I know Raimi likes to add humor to these films but a lot of these scenes turn the film into a self-parody. This is supposed to be dark? More like ridiculous. The only time this works is when Peter fights Harry and the black Spidey encounters Sandman in the subway, but other than that, this element was a wasted opportunity.Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst are also disappointments. The chemistry isn't as strong here and both their performances are weaker. Dunst comes off as whiny and Maguire has several moments where is frighteningly awful. One scene that takes place on a bridge bewtween him and Dunst where he is expected to be emotional is painfully embarrassing. His performance doesn't ring true playing the darker side as well, though that's partly bad writing too.In short, the film is just an all-round disappointment. The climactic action scene at the end even lacks the energy of the previous films. If Spider-Man 4 is going to come out in 2011, Sam Raimi better have a solid storyline that's not biting off more then he can chew or I'll be officially done with this franchise.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But I appreciate a good Spidey-fights-bad-guy day every once and a while. So. The good bits in Spiderman. The special effects, obviously (although there are a few moments while watching Sandman that makes you wonder if they'd just thrown in the towel before the making the finishing touches), are the strongest part of the movie. There's a few action scenes that are simply sublime in that way. The bad bits in Spiderman. The plot line is terrible. It makes no sense, and is completely and utterly random, complete with black slime falling from outer space in the form of a meteor. The acting is gloriously over the top. I mean, really. The ""crying"" had everyone in the theater howling. Also, it went on too long. They could have cut out a good 45 minutes, and made it a much better movie.

But his old friend Harry (James Franco) still has a score to settle with him over the death of his father and returns as the 'New' Goblin, ready to wreak vengeance on his old friend. But a freak accident lands him in hospital with severe memory loss (and just as well because villains wise in this film he's already got his work cut out.) So with him out the picture, Ol' Spidey must now battle the inner villain within himself when an evil new serum attaches itself to him, causing his suit to turn black and making his vicious instincts to come to life. These come in full force when he discovers the identity of his grand-father's real killer Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) who's just escaped from prison and has been turned into The Sandman, capable of morphing into a giant indestructible monster who can take on anything. In the face of his biggest challenge yet, Peter must defeat his greatest enemy as well as the raging evil within himself.With the rave reviews for the last two films still ringing fresh in my mind, I was expecting the final instalment in the Spider-Man franchise to receive similar glaring words. But I was as surprised as probably anyone was when it received a barrage of not awful but distinctly average reviews. A big complaint has been too many villains and I would agree with everyone on that. In fact it speaks volumes that the film's most memorable moment comes not with one of Spider-Man's showdowns with one of these villains, but with a spectacular action sequence involving a giant building block crashing into a skyscraper, causing everything (and everyone) in it to come plummeting out of it.This aside, I also want to niggle about the theme and tone of the film, involving Peter's quest for revenge and battle against the inner demons raging inside him. Batman is a dark hero, Spider-Man I think is more of an undemanding kind of hero, and the whole dark tone of the film I felt was totally mis-placed.I'm sure it won't be the worst blockbuster out this year, but I must say I'm glad Sam Raimi has finally closed the lid on the downward spiralling Spider-Man franchise and that there won't be any more to tarnish the memory of the highly enjoyable original. **","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Firstly, the character of Eddie Brock/Venom is physically so wrong. In the comics, he was a very tall and strapping person of 6 feet 4 inches and weighing about 290 pounds of muscle. In ""Spiderman 3,"" he looked about 5 feet 8 and weighing about 150 pounds. How on earth someone could have got this wrong I can't imagine. The next problem is Toby Maguire. He was truly out of his depth in attempting to play Peter Parker/Spiderman as being conceited or evil after the black costume invades him. His performance is shockingly bad and he looks a right prat! As a result, Maguire's career was killed off and he was labelled box office poison. The villain of the Sandman worked a little better. If the plot had stuck with him and had avoided including the black Spiderman costume, then this film might have worked. The look that Harry Osborn had as the new Green Goblin was a lazy and unimaginative one. The running time is far too long, just under two hours would have been an improvement. The one saving grace, was the climax. It was quite well handled and there was a bit of tension. A disappointing finish after the brilliance of the first two films.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It translates to the big screen epic plots that had a large amount of buildup to work with to establish their depth. Translating these plots to the big screen usually means condensing a lot of it into a short space. Sadly, SM3 tries to do that, and craft five different story lines around 5 different characters.There's Mary Jane, there's Peter Parker/Spider Man, there's Harry Osborn, there's Sandman and there's Eddie Brock. All five of the main cast are dynamic characters. Dynamic characters are characters that go through changes of circumstance and/or character in a movie; as opposed to static characters who go through the movie relatively unchanged. SM3 suffers from trying to give all 5 of these characters spotlight and ultimately, you don't know who the movie is really about or who is supposed to be the most important. The real reason the movie suffers is because all 3 villains try to fill the niche of being Spider-Man's arch-nemesis, and when all three try to take center stage, there ends up being no lead villain. This mirrors Spider-Man's situation from the comics where he's got Doctor Octopus, Venom and Green Goblin each vying for the top spot of Spider-Man's all-time nemesis. But at least in the comic books, you can devote arcs to each individual villain. When you stuff 3 cats into the same bag and give them one mouse to fight over, you end up with what SM3 comes out with: a hero flying blindly into piles of sand and web.The only redeeming aspects of the movie come at the final half where the plot threads finally start to come together and it feels like we're reading a single comic book again rather than putting down one in the middle of reading it only to pick up a different issue.Any longer and this movie would have thrown The Lizard/Curt Conners into the mix.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I actually fell asleep during this movie (that rarely ever happens, I even stayed awake through 300). The only good part about the movie was the special effects. Thats the only reason it didn't get a 1. The only way i suggest to go see this movie is for the special effects. If your looking for a story than keep looking. I suggest waiting till either May 25th and go to see Pirates Of The Caribbean 3:At Worlds End or June 8 for Hostel Part 2. Both of them are going to hit it huge unlike Spiderman 3. Hopefully they have ended the sorry franchise that we all know as the Spiderman movies. If you want a good comic book based movie go buy The Punisher, X-Men, The Hulk or Daredevil.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Overall I did like the movie because I am a huge Spider-Man fan; I mean I have him tattooed on my arm for heck's sake! They did try to cram too much into the film and tie up all of the loose ends. Such a shame. I think this was done partly if not wholly on the fact that the stars of the movie were only signed on for the 3 films.Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man, Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson, James Franco as Harry Osborne/New Goblin, and Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marco/Sandman were absolutely incredible. Sure the overconfident ""Dark Spider-Man"" was a little over the top but overall the performances of them were great and they did a spectacular job. I was especially impressed with Thomas Haden Church's performance. He really sold the piece, and man was he ripped; he really bulked up for the film. As for Topher Grace as Eddie Brock/Venom.....what can I say but absolutely pathetic. He did not seem to bulk up at all. It has always been known that Eddie Brock was supposed to have worked out constantly and had the strength equivalent to an Olympic weight lifter. The Venom just amplified the body's natural strengths. Venom was always supposed to be bigger and stronger then Spider-Man but just not as smart. Venom looked absolutely scrawny. And another thing...the Venom is also supposed to be able to change the appearance of the wearer so they didn't even need to wear street clothes, just think it and it would change its molecules to appear as clothes and provide the necessary pockets and whatnot. The Venom character was way too rushed, and was introduced all wrong. They should have introduced him using an already introduced character, John Jameson on a mission in space exploring a meteorite and the Venom sneaks on board the ship, the ship malfunctions on re-entry, and crashes into the river with Spider-Man coming by to save the survivors and the Venom sneaks onto Spider-Man as he is in the water. That would have been a whole heck of a lot better then just a random meteorite crashing to earth and sneaking back to Parkers apartment on the back of his scooter. Bruce Campbell's role as the restaurant employee was absolutely hilarious by the way, I'm glad he was worked into the film. Plus they got Stan Lee into the film and he got to say his signature ""Nuff Said"" line! That rocked! Overall I would have to say that this is my least favorite Spider-Man film for storyline, but favorite for action/fight sequence. The Spider-Man/New Goblin fight was incredible! I give this Movie 8 out of 10 Stars.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Spider-Man 2 was one of the best films of the past decade, with its alarmingly believable emotion and fantastic characters. But then came this disaster. This movie brings back plot details from the 1st film, making it feel as if the crew ran out of ideas for the story. This then results in Spidey hunting down Flint Marko, played by Thomas Haden Church in a talent-wasting performance. The love triangle between Dunst, Maguire, and Franco has zero sizzle. The action sequences are merely attention-grabbing instead of tense. Spider-Man's dark side is not terrifying, mainly consisting of stealing other people's girlfriends and wearing thick black eyeliner. Instead of being emotionally complex, the subplots this time feel sappy, forced, and manipulative. Church and Topher Grace (as Venom/Eddie Brock) are talented, but not as effective as Willem Dafoe (as the original Green Goblin) and Alfred Molina (as Doc Ock). The endless story lines and melodramatic speeches make this film bland, excessive, and boring. Even the behavior of the characters (leaving boyfriends, assaulting friends, not calling the police) is implausible. If quality ran the box office, this film would not even cross $100 million.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Also, it slowly began to turn into a corny love story, instead of a action comic movie, which it should be. Tobey Macguire and Kirsten Dunst perform one of their worst acting performances of their career. There was line after line of cheesy dialogue that took away from the story at hand.

Spiderman is one of those kinds of movies... It has some weak points, the story sometimes seems to forget one or other character, and then in the end they all come together like it was so natural. The sandman isn't such a bad guy but seems to be a bit too violent for a person who is just trying to save it's kid... a bit greedy isn't him? And if he's not a killer, why'd he agree to kill spiderman so easily?... OK, you can add lots of other bad things in the plot, you'll find'em, but isn't it supposed to be an entertaining movie? Yes, and to put the bad guys together Eddie, wearing the black suit finds the sandman in a blink and make in an allie in less than 5 seconds!! Besides that, and concentrating on the action itself, Spiderman 3 has a very good pace, and most of the situations happen in a ""natural"" way, entertaining a lot (which is it's main purpose). The special effects are great, lots of CGI of course, but even that is getting better and better, and now Spiderman jumps and action seems more real than ever! That was one of the reasons I went to watch the movie! The black suit is really nice and it was a really good story to pick from (will it return? there is a little sample on the laboratory where Parker left it to be analyzed)...I am Spiderman fan since I was a kid, although I stop reading the comics long ago, but this movie is probably the best in the series, mainly because it's superb special effects and CGI. Because of that, all the weak points aren't enough to say ""it's not a good movie""...","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

A classic Spidey one, then came the even more enthralling sequel. A disaster just had to happen with the franchise. I mean if the 'Out of this planet' Superman and 'Dark and Sinister' Batman had to go through bad sequels, then Spidey is, after all, the friendly neighborhood kid - I guess he had to take one.To all the fanboys out there - don't even bother! I'm one of you dudes! One of those who thinks that Spider-man is up there, with the best of the best, one of the best comic book characters ever created. So with Venom as a villain, one would've expected the whole 'taking the Peter Parker character to the next level of maturity' thing to happen. My oh my, for Pete's sake (pun intended) - Mr. Raimi, you made him a prancing egoistic sissy! He's crying, dancing and saying 'Yeah, babe' like the pothead who lives down the street. Really? This chap's the icon New York is worshiping? This movie managed to convince me that a cross dressing Rudy Giuliani is a far better mascot for New York than my favorite comic book hero!You know a movie will go wrong when the production team loses sight of what the movie is. For the record - it's a super hero movie, aka Action/Adventure genre. Why the heck are they trying so hard to induce melodrama and comedy into this? Don't get me wrong, I know the whole Mary Jane love angle is intricate to the story. Spidey one starts by saying this story is about a girl. But, jeez! So much of it? Remembering Unc Ben, the ill conceived love triangle, Sandman's dying daughter, Dual versions of uncle Ben's shooting, marriage advice counseling, Forgiveness - stop that train to La-La land already! I enjoy the odd comedic outlook of the Spider-man movies, the cheeky one liners or the wide eyed Parker look. But, this movie just has too many of them forced comedic moments for the taking. And the comedic elements actually add nothing to the narrative. The ill timed Jazz club dance by the Venom infected Peter Parker is probably the best joke of the movie - without intending to be one! Character development and humanizing the characters was the strength of this franchise. Poof! Gone into thin air this time round.It's not a question of what's not there in the movie, but a problem of 'too many'. There are too many plot holes despite me suspending belief for the superhero movie. Too many gimmicks. Too many characters. And yeah, too much time! The runtime of the movie tops two hours and then some, but when you have so much to pack into the movie - it feels like they've rushed through the 300 million dollar extravaganza.And for the last time, there's a reason why Spider-man puts on that mask. It's part of superhero folklore. When he let the mask down to save a train full of people in Spidey 2, that was one of the most real moments in the movie. Seems like now he's just fighting without the mask! No! Too much of anything good is bad. Very bad. I could go on. But, I feel bad lashing out further against my Friendly neighborhood pal. So lemme put in a good word - the first ten minutes. That's it. There's a little bit of lovey-dovey stuff (again, I can take it. Just don't turn Spider-man into an episode of the OC!), but the first fight sequence with Goblin 2 and Peter Parker is sudden, unexpected and in short, kicks some serious ass! You know that Spidey won't lose, but you definitely don't know how it'll end. So I guess that got my hopes up, but what followed the next two hours was equivalent of taking a cold shower after lounging with models from Victoria's Secret. Bad start, Summer of '07. And Spidey, puh-leese get someone like Christopher Nolan to direct your next outing. Realism - that's what you need right now.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Having grown up with Spiderman action figures and trying to imagine the best possible fight scenes and scenarios for my favorite superhero, I was thoroughly impressed with the scope and creativity brought to every single fight sequence. Not to mention the fact that the film completely captures the inherent humor in people fighting in mid-air: The scene with Harry Osborne fighting Peter Parker towards the beginning of the film is by far the best, and it has slapstick comedy throughout that will keep even the most easily-distracted human beings(like myself) entertained.The problems arise when you take the sheer scope of the film: two and a half new villains (Sandman, Venom, and the half being the already-vengeful Harry) and Peter's complex inner struggle between vengeance and righteousness, and cram all of this into just two and a half hours. As soon as all the parts of the epic storyline are finally introduced and before they even have a chance to fully develop, the whole movie takes a complete nosedive in what seems to be a clumsy effort to finish the film on time. This humble observer's opinion is that a cliffhanger ending with the promise of a fourth movie (a la ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"") would have been justly warranted and would have left a much more satisfied general public. Instead, the hasty rap-up of the movie left many in my theater displeased. But then again, now the Spidey-loving public will have a conversation topic that will certainly last a long time to come, and isn't that worth the eight bucks right there? Overall, Spidey-fans will get everything they came for and much more: Huge action, great conflict, mind-boggling special effects, incredible spills and chills, and the promise of a bright future for Spiderman!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Marco stumbles into a particle experiment chamber, where they are experiment on particles using sand, Marco gets caught in this experiment and his DNA structure tangles with the particles of sand, and The Sandman is born. But wait there is even more, a strange small comet crashes in the out skitrts of New York City, where funnily enough Peter Parker is at that précis moment with MJ, out of this comet comes a sybiot (Black living slime)witch later on in the story attachés it self to Peter to create Dark Spider-man and Dark Peter Parker as well. And yes there is even more, Eddie Brock Jr (Topher Grace) is in town and is hoping to become the newest member at the Daily Bugle, this character is a rival to Peter Parker and soon Spider-man. After Peter realises that the Blck suit is changing him after some bad events, he rids himself of the suit, but Eddie unintentionally gets some onto him self and becomes Venom. There is also a new girl in town, Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) who is also the girl friend to Eddie Brock Jr, she has feelings for Peter Parker as well as Spider-man and this causes problems between MJ and Peter.This film may sound excellent as i thought it did before i saw the film, but it all most seems like a completely different film, where u don't see hardly anything of Spider-man swinging through the city like in the first two films, but more centred on the relationship with MJ and Peter, also there seems to be stupid one liners and completely perfectic dancing in the street (as Dark Peter Parker). As it says in the adverts ""This may be the end of Spider-man"", well this film truly is in my opinion the end of Spider-man. I believe it comes down to Director Sam Raimi, who made two very excellent films with the past Spider-man, but with the third instalment he thought he would take a dabble at doing the Screenpaly of the film, and this was where it went wrong, as Raimi should stick with his directing.I would still suggest seeing the film, but purely because the first two were excellent and you might as well see the third, but be don't have the hopes of seeing another superhero classic.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Straight out of the comics people, it is a comic book movie after all. Sure, the movie had its problems, but people are talking about it like its ""From Justin to Kelly"" for Gods sake. The action sequences were Stellar with great great acting for the most part. Raimi just simply tried to squeeze too much into 1 sitting.

The story line was terrible, but the special effects made up for it. Had I known how bad the movie really was I would never had gone to see it. The battle scenes were extremely cool, but a little tacky.They made Venom into a pansy and Sandman into someone that they want you to sympathize with. Sometimes in the flick, you can't get past Eric Foreman's (Topher Grace's character on That 70s Show) voice as the voice of Venom. I would also really like to know why they keep killing the villains off, i.e. Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus, New Goblin, and Venom. This definitely takes away from the Spiderman series, knowing that in the comic books, the villains return. If this is a movie that you're dying to see, my advice to you is to rent it. I hope they make up for it in Spiderman 4, which I will not be seeing in theaters.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie shuffles through a good number of potentially great stories, but they do fall thin. Don't get me wrong, its story is still a great story. But the storytelling suffers from trying to condense everything efficiently.I would not be surprised if Sam Raimi eventually releases a warranted ""Extended Cut"" of Spider-Man 3. This movie ran for 2.5 hours, but I feel it's destined to be told in at least 3 hours and with more polish.Gone is the focus and some would say ""heart"" that strongly resonated in Spider-Man 2. We felt the aches, pains, and rewards that Peter Parker felt in that film. Spider-Man 3 is a web of stories that do interlock with Peter realizing that he has much growing up to do and he has yet to learn that beyond sympathy there is empathy.But it is hard to have empathy for the cast in this film because we are getting condensed glimpses of their experiences (which all do interlock with themes of Peter's growth as an individual). Spider-Man 3 attempts to sum up the inner struggle of its many characters in very small doses of tiny examples. The result is that we barely get to experience these characters. We know how they feel and we also know what we are supposed to feel. We have sympathy for these characters. However, we don't actually feel through these characters. There's just no room for empathy when all we get are small examples that only allow us to sympathize for them. The movie just doesn't show us the empathy that Peter Parker must learn himself in this movie. If anything, the film makes the same mistake Peter himself makes when he just pays lip service out of sympathy.This is a good thing for the sorts of audience that yell out ""I get it already,"" but it loses the emotional impact that brought so much respect to Spider-Man 2. Most people felt for Spider-Man 2. Many people will merely see Spider-Man 3.The cast gives a good overall performance. Some of it is risky such as seeing how far Maguire can portray a darker Peter Parker in this film, but it's set up so well that when we see it, it's not overacting, it's intentional corniness. Tobey does a fine job, but a team effort was needed to make it work. Dunst has some powerful moments in this film, but they are scattered about far enough apart that we're merely getting reminded of it now and then. I would comment on the rest of the cast, but their performances were shuffled all over the movie. Odd as it may sound, but Bruce Campbell probably gives the most memorable performance. And it's very Bruce Campbell. Take that as you will.Danny Elfman might be consulting on this film, but his direct role is definitely missing. The score of Spider-Man 3 is fine, but it doesn't narrate the story nearly as well as the score for Spider-Man 2. There are great pieces though and it is amazing how well various Spider-Man themes from the past can be rewritten into different genres. I think the Spider-Man 3 score makes a good collection of music, but it doesn't narrate this story very well. It's almost all highlights.The action sequences are fun and longer than your average action sequences. Furthermore, while there are a lot of CG based fight scenes, there are a lot of actor/stuntman fights as well. The final ""spectacular"" action sequence is an entire roller coaster ride in itself, but the atmosphere was a bit much for me (you'll have to see the movie but I felt like I was literally watching a roller coaster ride at a theme park, flags and all). Its intention is that it's a ""spectacle within a spectacle."" I'm trying hard not to give spoilers here.It should be noted that there are a lot of hilarious and entertaining moments in Spider-Man 3. They are there and they pretty much deliver. That's why I give this film an 8, it meets a lot of requirements.Spider-Man 3 has a lot of substance too... but we can only get a shallow glimpse of it. If Sam Raimi decides to put out an extended version of the film, I am all for it. But for what it is, it's good entertainment and it's not an entire sell-out by Raimi. However, compromises were definitely made.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I am not sure if I have watched and critically analyzed enough movies, sequels, and trilogies to comment whether Spiderman-III is a good fit to the Spiderman series, and has met the expectations of people.What I'd say is, It is always lonely at the top. You never know what to do, but to take the next step wisely, based on your knowledge and experience. Its just that, 'There is always a room at the top' also comes with the previous saying, and hence, even a little mistake might allow others to overtake you or point fingers at you or get some fingers pointed at you.Spiderman-III, is an entertainer. It has got some good acting, music, story, action, and you would enjoy watching it with your friends, family or alone:) I won't say much more about the movie. But, I wonder if they'd ever come up with a movie which has super-heroes on one side, i.e., Spiderman, Superman and Batman...and the super-villains on the other.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Spiderman 3 serves a different kind of master. It not only wants to make money, it wants to get its messages across as well. Messages like love, sacrifice, justice, responsibility, inner demons, outer demons, jealousy, envy, friendship, brotherhood, peace, decency, patience and understanding. It would take three seasons of ""Barney"" to get all that across. Sam Rami decides that it can fit into his movie.But squeezing the entirety of the human emotional range isn't as easy as it sounds, folks. And bearing the weight of these diverse themes is poor Spidey, Tobey Maguire. While Spiderman himself battles foes of darkness, Tobey surrenders the battle of the script and plays out the page.Maguire looks silly, and while the audience may have sympathy for him, there's no empathy. We're lost in the mess of characters and plot lines that have been sacrificed for half-witted melodramatic moments. The action is pulsing, but it's no spectacular and the fight scenes are dully paced (excepting an early duel of Harry vs. Peter but of course that's completely useless - Rami uses the scene to bring emotional distress on Peter and emotional resonance from Harry so we cheer for Spidey but feel for Harry and can't decide and oh whoops there we go...). Anyone ever seen 'The Adventures of Robin Hood?' That's what a fight scene is supposed to be like. Which fight scene am I talking about? Pick one.The acting is the only thing that will truly leave a tear on your cheek. And this acting is not the stuff of Maguire, a dull-but-delicious James Franco, the eerie Bryce Dallas Howard or the miscast Topher Grace. It's the sweet Kirsten Dunst one weeps for, as well as the peerless James Cromwell. Don't waste your time on this latest Hollywood bonanza. It may seem like more then a special effects show at first glance, but the self-righteous melodrama is only concealing the true nature of this blockbuster - yes, it's a popcorn tween action flick that just happens to be boring.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There is still a lot of good in it, but there is a LOT of bad too. There is a lot of dumb stuff. So many of the scenes look fake. Major reliance on CGI for extended portions of the movie. Both villains were very cartoony. Some action scenes were great while others were kind of useless. The love drama stuff between the 3 main characters was really annoying, and the scene in the jazz bar was baffling.It's funny because the general consensus is that this movie is a mess because of having 3 villains. From what i understand, venom was forced into the story by the studio. But a huge portion of this movie is spent on completely useless and forced relationship drama. They think the only way you can have a good movie is if the guy gets the girl.All of that could be removed from this movie without changing anything, especially the gwen stacey stuff. Instead, they could have explored the 3 villain storylines further. Each of them has enough potential to fill a movie.Watching again in 2021, this entire trilogy feels very outdated, or maybe even just worse by today's standards. So this rating isn't too far below my rerating of 1 and 2 (6 stars). (5 viewings, 6/27/2021)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Even with the extended running time the focus is diffused, and as a result none of it makes an impact. To make matters worse, there's an odd tonal shift here, where the nice balance between humor and drama established in the first two films is ditched in favor of high camp.With very little to recommend about it, 'Spider-Man 3' serves as a rather sour note on which to end the Raimi trilogy.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Then in 2004 Sam Raimi outdid himself by directing a sequel that took everything that made the original great and improved upon it. Fast-forward to May 4, 2007 and Sam Raimi is at it again with ""Spider-Man 3."" With arguably two great, this review believes that they belong in the league of the best of their genre, comic book adaptations under his belt; can Sam Raimi bring a successful third film to the saga? Peter Parker's life is finally starting to look up. His relationship with Mary Jane Watson is picking up, he is still taking responsibility as Spider-man, and he is a celebrity in NY. Now he faces new challenges. Parker's old friend, Harry Osborn, is out for revenge against Peter; Parker also discovers that his Uncle's real killer, Flint Marko, who is mistakenly transformed into the Sandman, is still out there. Hope seems lost until Peter discovers a black alien organism, aka a symbiote, which turns his suit black but improves his powers significantly. Unfortunately, the side effects of the symbiote show a darker side to Parker's personality. When Peter discovers his wrongdoings, he attempts to get rid of the symbiote suit. Parker successfully gets rid of the symbiote, but it found a new host, Eddie Brock, causing the birth of Venom, Spider-Man's most dangerous foe. Will this be the end of Spider-Man?The biggest flaw of the movie, which you should realize after reading the synopsis, is that there is too much going on. There are too many plots, too many characters, and too little development. The audience has to watch Spider-man face off with three villains and his inner-demon. In addition Gwen Stacy is added as part of a love triangle. Applause should go to Sam Raimi for attempting to bring it all together but the entire plot and subplots would be better suited for an extra movie. This was a big worry upon this reviewer but Sam does it better then originally thought. It was a lot better then the poor excuse for a director, Brett Ratner, of ""X-Men: The Last Stand.""Despite there being too much in the movie, the movie was very entertaining. As far as film-making goes it is not the quality of one or two, but as far as the fun superhero, comic book type of movie, it was everything that it should have been. The visual effects were amazing. The action scenes were the best of the series. The humor was upped a lot as well, though some may complaint about there being too much. The acting was as good as it should be. As far as a ""Spider-Man"" movie goes this is what you should expect.Visually this movie was outstanding. The special effects were out of this world but since it is the most expensive movie ever made that is expected. It would be shocking if this movie is not nomiated for special effects. The visual effects that really stood out were the creation of the Sandman and the symbiote. The action scenes were great as usual. This reviewer thought that they were more thrilling then that train scene from ""Spider-Man 2.""Besides the visuals, the humor was great. It was just as campy and silly as the first two series but turned up a notch. Bruce Campbell made another cameo, as he has in the last two, as the hilarious Maître d'. There is even homage to both ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""The Mask."" Some may complain that some of these more campy scenes ruin the movie, but this reviewer thinks otherwise. The reviewer loved those scenes; he believes they improved the movie.The acting was as good as you should hope for in a movie like this. The returning cast was just as good as the other two. The newcomers are also a great addition to the ""Spider-Man"" cast. Thomas Hayden Church was good as the Sandman/ Flint Marko. Topher Grace, Eric from ""That 70's Show,"" was a huge surprise as Eddie Brock/ Venom. It will be exciting to see what Topher's career choices will be after ""That 70's Show."" Bryce Dallas Howard was also great as Gwen Stacy. It was very obvious why Peter Parker would like her and why Mary Jane could possibly be jealous of her.Overall if you liked or loved the first two ""Spider-Man"" you may like it. The reviewers are very mixed but that is probably because the viewers each had expectations that were too high. The only real defect to the movie was that there was too much happening. Luckily everything else that this reviewer loved made it forgivable. Any other complaints are just very minor nitpicks. Congratulations to ""Spider-Man 3"" for collecting $151.1 million at the domestic box office it's opening week. ""Spider-Man 3"" is recommended!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

So, I went to this very excited. What a complete let down.I was so bored. Even with three villains they couldn't keep me paying attention.The dialog is so terribly melodramatic and unreal people in the audience were actually laughing when characters on screen were crying and revealing their innermost feelings.Characters swung from one side to the other, from good to evil, just by hearing a couple of honest words or seeing the light that seemed to come from absolutely nowhere? Okay, the special effects were really good. They keep getting better and better. The Sandman's scenes were especially well done.But what I loved about the last two movies was their integrity in regards to character motivations and emotions. This one just planted feelings on the surface and relied on whining and tears to emote.The writers this time are the ones to blame. Please Hollywood, realize you need real writers in order to tell meaningful stories. Producers and Directors are not always good writers.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Best of the three but not flawless! :D","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1649272/?ref_=tt_urv","XAEEM","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5084409/?ref_=tt_urv","4 May 2007","This was a brilliant piece of entertainment, it had drama, romance, horror, thriller, adventure, action and comedy (lots of it).The film starts slow, putting the audience up close to the characters, getting us used to them again and putting us in their world and their family to help us understand their bond. Then the action is kick started and we get a glimpse of how good the next action scenes are going to be. James Franco gives a very good performance as angry/evil Harry, i was surprised that such a young actor could be that convincing, though for a few split seconds i did think he was over acting.Tobey is even better in this one than in the previous films, you actually believe that he's a grown up peter parker and that he's not so much of a nerd anymore and he's coming to terms with his identity. He plays the arrogant part very well as well.Tobey (again) when 'possessed' by the symbiotic goo is again very convincing, you can see a total change of character while still getting glimpses of the underlying 'regular' peter parker. He excels in the scenes where he has to be 'bad'.Kirsten Dunst wasn't all that good as her eyes don't seem to act much, her face has pretty much a basic set of expressions except when she cries. Wasn't happy with her but it was forgivable seeing as she played the distraught actress part quite well.Church was wasted i think, he was SO good in the few scenes he had as normal flint Marco, i wish they'd shown more of him in human form.Grace was wasted as well, not enough screen time, he definitely could NOT have been a main and only villain but he should have had as much screen time as Church did so as to establish his back story, not enough was done in that respect n i was disappointed.Bryce Dallas Howard was very pleasant on the eyes as Gwen but again her and parker's relationship could have been explored further.Now back to the actual on screen eye candy. Spiderman in regular costume was relegated to the background, his scenes do stand out but not because of his acrobatics but more due to whats going on around him (crane scene in trailer is brilliant). Sandman, especially the birth of sandman scene is a beauty to watch, the sand flowing with the wind, and taking Flint Marko's shape. The special effects were really well done and i do think this film deserves an award for the CGI. Venom is TOO scarce, in the short scenes that we do see him, he is amazing, the face, the tongue, the teeth, the eyes and the muscular body, even his webbing, They hit the bullseye as far as his design is concerned, I'm a big venom fan and i am very happy with the outcome of the venom design. Topher's squeaky voice is kinda weird when seeing him talk as venom but he still does look like he's enjoying being 'bad'. What annoyed me was the fact that he became more of a gimmick and had very limited lines as venom. They could have done so much more with him.The comedy in this film will blow you away. Entertainment at its purest, i haven't laughed this hard since SO long. The dance sequences and the 'aloof' peter parker are so funny & enjoyable to watch and provide good relief from the sometimes heavy drama parts of the film.J Jonah Jameson's scenes also provide great comic relief especially when he's trying to control his anger, that was a hilarious moment and the whole audience cracked up during those scenes.Im not going to say more as i don't want to spoil it but just so you know the ending is satisfying and ties up a lot of loose ends from the previous films and it also gives a sense of where things are going to go if they ever make a 4th film.Some parts do seem to be a bit too emotionally charged, some not enough and there is also the feel that some key scenes may have been edited out as far as character relationships are concerned although if you watch closely you can guess what happened just before the current scene. All in all, the best of the trilogy for me, i always preferred spider-man 1, but this one is now my favourite. Im actually more of a batman fan but i just love what Sam Raimi did with this franchise and I'm sure as hell going to buy the DVD when it comes out. Im planning on seeing this again in the next few weeks!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Tobey McGuire turns a new leaf as Emo Spidey with a chip on his shoulder, Kirsten Dunst struggles with Peter's habit of letting her down as well her own troubles, James Franco finally acts upon his father's death as the New Green Goblin (rather than the Hobgoblin, as he was known in previous incarnations), and we meet new stars in Thomas Haden Church (who gives a fantastic performance as The Sandman) and Topher Grace (Eddie Brock/Venom). familiar faces come back to bring up support as well. J.K Simmons returns to give another outstanding performance as J. Jonah Jamesson, William Dafeo and Cliff Roberston make an appearance once again as the mental flashbacks, and Rosemary Harris makes you love her grandma-like nature once again. all of the main acting is generally good, ranging from acceptable to cosmic. hell, even the small roles of the scene extras weren't half bad (though nothing as wonderful as ""HEY! he stole that guy's PIZZA!!!""). the special effects from the movie have heightened and what was previously unthinkable in live-action cinema has become a reality in terms of bringing such villains to life. the cinematography is even better, and the fantastic feeling of really swinging with Spider-Man is even more captivating now. often the effect of the camera-work and CGI left my mouth wide open. but for me, the best things about this movie were the little things: namely, Bruce Campbell's hilarious spot-on comedy, and Stan Lee saying ""nuff said"" (though i'll admit it was a forced performance).now, that being said, there's many points about this movie that seem ridiculous. one is the pacing for the whole movie. it's on and off like an overworked hooker on a steam engine, and runs through like the chaotic fantasies of an ADD kid with a 36MM. ever see Spidey swing into action, pausing only to strike a pose in front of a huge American flag? trust me, as awesome as it sounds, it merely comes off as misplaced patriotism here. another bad point is the arrival of the Symbiote substance. not to spoil anything, but it lands in a meteor. am I the only one who thinks the original appearance (crawling out of a fallen space shuttle Spidey had kept from crashing) would have been much more impressionistic on the film? and to think that Parker, with his heightened senses, wouldn't notice a meteor crashing not 50 meters from him? I mean, I realize he's making out with Kirsten Dunst at the time and more enticing things are..ahem..""at hand"", but gimme a break. another flaw is the whole appearance of Gwen Stacy. sure, comic fans might find this a nice nod to one of Peter's pre-MJ girlfriends, but she serves no purpose through the movie. Peter never once shows that he cares about her in any way, he merely uses her to make Mary Jane feel bad, who fusses over it like a child. to me, the entire conflicting love triangle between him, Gwen and Mary Jane seemed pointless and tragically high school in a sense. Venom is another character who was poorly constructed. he's more of a sniveling, scheming, whiny-voiced skinny guy rather than the conniving, intensely frightening brute we all know him as. he doesn't even really catch the attention at all until the climax. ah, the climax. like the pacing, it's on and off. Sandman redeems himself in an excellent fashion, but then provides a ""wtf?"" moment when he simply leaves, leaving no real ending for him. my friend and I literally said ""sooo.....he..flew away?"" ""uh...yeah...but why?"" ""fuck if I know"". as for Venom and Harry...well, i'll leave that up for you to see yourself. if you want to hear my thoughts on that then message me, because I won't go into it here for those who haven't seen the movie yet. i'm thoroughly disappointed with Raimi on this outing, i expected more from him than this sort of Hollywood summer name-brand blockbuster","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I think the reason for this is that I realised on viewing that I am becoming tired of Spidey now and they should lay it rest before they damage the reputation of what all in all has been a great trilogy. I feel there is nowhere else for them to go now.I didn't think much to the special effects in this film either - many of them looked rather amateur and didn't seem to ""flow"" along properly with the action - kind of jarring and some even looked cartoon-like rather than real. I suppose me being a critic of CGI may explain that last comment but I can only write what my eye sees.The new villain, the Sandman was good and an exception to the dowdy special effects in that all the action sequences in which he was involved in worked very well indeed and looked real.The on/off relationship between Parker and MJ continued throughout the movie and I found myself wondering why Parker kept bothering with such a moody young woman - obviously it must be down to the stunning good looks of Kirsten Dunst, one of my all-time favourite sexy chicks.All in all it was the usual mix of action/romance/thriller/comedy that we have come to expect with Spiderman movies and I feel sure that fans will not be disappointed with this film. A bit of a tear-jerker too towards the end.Just one last word about the middle portion of the film when Parker was infected by the black stuff and was trying to act cool: RIDICULOUS!! And not one bit funny - they could have used the time much better with maybe another fight scene.I will buy the DVD on release simply because I own the other 2.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So many characters, and so many stories going on at once. It's a surprise that they were able to cram everything into the 2 hour and 20 minute running time. This may sound like a long film, which it technically is, but with so much going on it still felt that they should have given the more time to explain itself. For the first time in a Spiderman film we are introduced to multiple villains. First we have Flint Marko aka. The Sandman, who in my opinion is easily the best character in the film, played very well by Thomas Hayden Church. A character that you just might find yourself caring for. He is a flawed villain, not at all evil at heart but is forced to commit these crimes to get money to help his sick daughter. Eventually joining him is Eddie Brock aka Venom, a fan favorite character who is also exposed to the dark Symbiote after Peter, and inherits similar powers to Spiderman(this is due to the Symbiote remembering). Venom is played by That 70's Show star Tropher Grace. He played it well, but it is hard to watch him and not see Eric Forman, considering how similar he played Eddie to his famous television character. However, once he has that Symbiote suet and becomes the Venom, you cannot help but get your geek on and enjoy it! Finally he have the ""New Goblin"" which is just vengeful Harry Osborn using his fathers technology to recreate the foe we all remember from the original film. New Goblin is basically an angry snowboarder, an angry showboarder with bombs. We do not actually see a lot of this character in the film, and to be honest it is hard to think of him as a villain being Harry. Because really he is just angry and confused kid who thinks his best friend killed his father.You really do have to take Spiderman 3 with a grain of salt, or two. Again, it has a lot of story, but it also has a lot of humor, which may seem out of place. Its not only Spiderman who becomes this darker self but Peter Parker also becomes another person. Which can only be described as one thing, EMO(Emo is a ambiguous term used to describe a subculture of fashion and music which is sort of a combination between Punk and Goth. An ""EMO Kid"" is usually angry quite and dark. EMO coming from the word EMOtional.) Its not clear weather this is supposed to be humorous or not, but it really is. When you see Peter with his bangs combed down and his eyes darkened by make-up, you cannot help but laugh. Also being that this is the vision of Sam Raimi, you know it must have been meant for laughs. There is one scene in particular which sees Peter strutting down the sidewalk to some cornball music striking cornball poses to all the ladies, and even stopping at a fashion store and getting some ""hip new threads"". Its moments like this that can kill a film, and for a lot of people it did. Its out of place campy humor and dancing really kinda picks the film up and carries it to a different place for a few scenes. The concept is good, Peter is a dork, and if the Symbiote is supposed to bring out your dark inner self, then Peter, though now dark, should still be a dork. Which he is. Though perhaps having Peter dancing on a bar was a bit too much. There is some great comedic moments in the film, most of which involves J. Jonah Jameson and his newspaper staff, and another wonderful show stealing cameo from the legendary actor, and Raimi regular Bruce Campbell. Who plays a french Maitre d.Where Spiderman really thrives, and uses most of its $250million budget is the action, and the way over the top(in a good way I suppose)CGI! The action is top notch, you may have to grit your teeth and suffer through some dramatic scenes, but its all worth which when you get to see one amazing climax! And in between we also have some pretty great moments, including a very memorable sewer battle between the symbiote Spiderman and Sandman! The CGI is almost flawless which is an enormous leap forward from the somewhat animated looking graphics from the original film. Regardless of what you think of the story, or the jokes, or the drama. One thing is for sure, you have to be dead to not at least enjoy the action!Overall Spiderman 3 is a worth while finale(?), to what has become the most successful comic book franchises ever created. It may not be the strongest in the series, but then again when is a third film ever the strongest? It is very much worth watching, and it's a must watch on the big screen. Love it or hate it Spiderman 3 is destined to be one of the most successful films of the year in this ""summer of sequels"". You may even have to watch it more then once to fully digest what is given to you. One thing is for sure, its needs some tweaking from what is being shown in its initial theatrical release, and if we all know the film business there will most likely be another version of the film. Perhaps as an initial DVD release, or maybe a second release later on. But as Kevin Smith once said ""Theatrical releases are just previews for the DVD release""Spiderman 3 The Directors Cut will arrive one day. . .","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

When Tom Holland's definitive incarnation eventually graced the screen in a glorious extended cameo, it suddenly all made sense. Sony, who still held onto the rights but agreed to share with Marvel and allow him into their universe, simply didn't know what to do with him. They were on a roll with Sam Raimi's horror-inflected vision, which placed character above action and made Parker an underdog you could really root for. But the studio wanted more, and forced Raimi to shoe-horn in a fan-favourite villain at the expense of what was so great about this series. The worst part is that they did it again just seven years later with their Andrew Garfield-led reboot.The villain the studio demanded was Venom, the razor-toothed, lizard-tongued alien symbiote who attaches itself to Spider-Man and improves his powers, while turning him into a dancing, floppy-haired douchebag at the same time. But Venom isn't the only Spidey foe appearing, for we also have a new Green Goblin, played by a returning James Franco, and Flint Marko, aka the Sandman, played by an incredibly bored-looking Thomas Haden Church. The evolution of Franco's Harry Obsorn has been set up from the very start, so his emergence as his father's successor to don the goblin mask and wreak havoc for our friendly neighbourhood web-spinner should feel natural and well-timed, until he is hit on the head and develops amnesia. With so much already going on, it feels like both an unnecessary step back in the story and sheer lazy writing. We are also given Marko's backstory, and it turns out the lug-headed escaped con was the man really responsible for Uncle Ben's death, which paves the way for more of Tobey Maguire's constipation face during his quiet time with Aunt May (Rosemary Harris).There's simply too much going on, and when the film allows the pace to slow enough to spend some quality time with its central character, it turns out that Peter has turned into such an insufferable narcissist that we can't wait to get away from him. But, if you've seen the film, you'll know that's not the worst of it. The black alien goo arrives from space without explanation, and just so happens to land nearest to Peter Parker. The posters teased the darker side of Spider-Man, but what we got was spontaneous dancing, winking at girls in the street, and not listening to Mary Jane's (Kirsten Dunst) acting career troubles. I remember hiding behind my hands back in 2007 during the now-infamous dance sequence, and it hasn't improved with age. I've never uttered the words ""I just want it to stop"" out loud during a movie before, not until I saw Spider-Man 3 for the second time anyway. But it doesn't stop, not for what feels like another two hours, squeezing in Eddie Brock's (Topher Grace) transformation from slimy, unethical photographer into the vengeful Venom, and forging alliances that come out of nothing. As the wasted Kirsten Dunst screams as she hangs from an alien web at the climax, you'll be thinking that everybody involved is so much better than this, and they were, just three years earlier.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was much better than the second and about as good as the first. The dynamics among all the characters was great. It seemed a lot more natural this time around. There was definitely chemistry between James Franco and Kirsten Dunst. They were great together. The Sandman was a cool villain and Thomas Haden Church was an excellent choice to play him. He was great at playing a helpless, desperate guy doing the best he could in a bad situation. And he didn't have to say a lot to portray this. And lets not forget about the great action and special effects. I loved the way how everything kind of got tied up at the end.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Sam Raimi has done so well with the previous two films, that many have had doubts that he would be able to top himself with this one. He has done it. Spider-Man 3 is the best Spider-Man film thus far.After the movie finished, I heard a big majority of the audience say the same thing: ""It was horrible"". We must have seen different movies, because to call Spider-Man 3 ""horrible"" is a tremendous mistake. The reasons as to why they thought it was ""horrible"" varied. One was because ""Spidey got his butt kicked too much"" or because ""too much attention was paid to the visual effects and not enough attention was paid to the story as a whole"". Both statements are inaccurate.Spider-Man, in my eyes, is one of the most real superheroes of our time. He's a young guy with problems inside and outside the costume. Even when he's behind the mask, he experiences problems. Villains hurt him, buildings sometimes get destroyed, but ultimately, he comes through. For someone to say that Spidey got his ""butt kicked too much"" is ridiculous. After all, Peter Parker is still human; Spider-Man is Peter Parker, Peter Parker is Spider-Man.As for the storyline, I felt as though it was the most moving and deep story lines of all three movies. Peter seems to have it all, the love of the people when he is Spider-Man, success in school, and of course, the love of his life, Mary Jane Watson. But just like any normal person, he's got his share of problems too. For one, Flynt Marko wants Spider-Man dead. Eddie Brock might take his job, Mary Jane is getting tired of his ego, and Harry Osbourne is still dead set on avenging his father's death. The course in which these events unfold really does a great job in pulling the viewer in, and keeping them there.No one is perfect, but that's just the way life is. You make the right decisions though, and things will come together. This is the main message behind Spidey 3.There's action, comedy, romance, but most importantly, a deeper meaning. Pay attention, and you'll take away a lot more than just a fun 2 hours and 20 minutes.Hats off to Sam Raimi and everyone else involved in Spider-Man 3. This one steals the show.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Depsite the overwhelming hype it received, it failed to deliver. Publicity on its own fails to compensate for a great movie. This calibre of movie typically received widespread publicity which is clearly not justified.The storyline is well written, but executed poorly. The movie though feels like an epic as it is 2 and half hours, which could easily been condensed. Some unnecessary scenes could have been eradicated. The pace of the story is too slow, filled in gaps with some irritating and baffling scenes. It took too long for the main villains Sandman and Venom to burst into the scene. By the time the movie introduced the villains, the movie was more than mid-way through the movie.The characterisation of the movie is really bland. Sandman and Venom could have been further developed. With Venom, being the weakest character with no history underlying his character at all. Instead he growls like anything and scares everyone with his intimidating looks. Is this the rocky horror show if you get what I mean?Spiderman 3 is the weakest link. The expectation of Spiderman 4 does not look promising at all with a relatively weak Spiderman 3. How can the story be developed? Who are the main arch villains? Surely story material will have dried down considerably as proved with the movie reviewed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If your looking for an immediate start you'll get it!if your looking for jaw dropping action you'll get it!if your looking for unbelievable cinematography you'll get it! Spiderman 3 believe the HYPE! Its everything a modern day super hero film should be and if your going to watch this film you will appreciate it more with the cinema experience,from the surround sound which has been used to the max which has you feeling like spiderman is swinging around your head to the amazing picture in every scene. The story is equally as good as the other spiderman films having great flash backs and tying up loose ends. What i was most impressed with was the way venom was put on screen he looked so real and has been extremely well done.Also Topher Grace playing venom is a great choice has he is very cocky and brash which is ideal to venom's character straight from the comic books. The only thing i was a little disappointed at was that Venom doesn't get much screen time but i sure Stan lee knows what a popular villain Venom is and I'm sure he will feature again. Overall this is a great movie, not just a great superhero movie but a great movie.The spiderman movie future looks great i just cant wait until the hype and Spiderman are BACK!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

You can blame it on the symbiote, but Peter was already self-centered 5 minutes into the film and MJ was overly critical.Rather than focus on an epic final confrontation between Peter and Harry, the filmmakers instead went the soap opera amnesia route to make room for lesser conflicts.With too much going on and the worst ""cool guy"" dance moves in film history, Spider-Man 3 is a dumpster fire from start to finish. The fact that the line ""Find us some shade. Thanks, hot legs."" made it into the final cut is baffling.

"9","/10","""Spider-Man 3""  Summer '07 Officially Swings In","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1652131/?ref_=tt_urv","frankwhat","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3927011/?ref_=tt_urv","8 May 2007","Ultimately I was highly impressed by the last installment of a trilogy that due to its immediate success has spawned a supposedly unplanned follow-up trilogy. ""Spider-Man 3"" starts off on a happy note and all is well for Peter Parker, however things quickly go awry as his web gets even more tangled than ever before. A big warning to all potential viewers should be that if they're not familiar with the comic books with at least a general knowledge of the new villains, then there's a favorable chance that they will become completely lost along the way. This is mainly due to the fact that so many characters and subplots were crammed into too short of a time and the story moves along at a lighting fast pace. If you aren't paying attention I can see how it'd be very easy to get confused about who's who.Even though there was a mostly younger cast they all did supremely well. Tobey Maguire was probably the only exception but even he was okay. J.K. Simmons was absolutely hilarious and even though he was cramped for screen time, whenever he was present the audience was laughing. The same went for Bruce Campbell who despite only having one scene, made sure all eyes were on him for that whole time. The biggest surprise for me was Bryce Dallas Howard who I normally haven't been thrilled by, nevertheless was very pleasant hereboth on the eyes and acting-wise.The biggest weakness of this film besides squeezing too much into it, was the cheese factor. The worst of the worst was when Spider-Man runs past an American flag. This was tied with the jazz club dance routine. The audience was literally groaning out loud at this and ruined the momentum that was built up until these points. Plain and simple they just didn't belong. I'm not even going to comment on when Peter Parker develops a darker side since that sequence was too corny to capture the essence of in mere words.On the brighter side there were many pluses, the first being the CGI as it was incredible. So much work must've been put into making the Sandman character as they fine-tuned him down to each grain. I also was impressed at how so many separate stories were tied together so well. The musical score was invigorating and set an appropriate pace. Even though the running length clocked in at around two-and-a-half hours, I couldn't tell since there weren't many slow moments and it seemed to fly by. The producers could've easily added on another half-hour and I wouldn't have noticed. That might've even been a better way to go.Any true fans of the ""Spider-Man"" franchise should see this. The tone and style are a lot different than the first two, but in some ways this is better since it adds a darker feel to the experience. There are some great quotes as always, which is a bare essential of any worthwhile comic book adaptation. To all those cynics that are complaining about the lack of clearly defined villains, well welcome to reality. Even the most ruthless bad guys either have some good to them in real life, or there were mitigating reasons for what made them into what they are. I thought that touch made it easier to identify with the antagonists since they had actual human aspects to them.Sam Raimi stuck to his artistic vision as best that he could and the successful completion of a blockbuster such as this deserves the high box office results it'll certainly produce. I'm very glad that they will continue the series even if it means bringing in a new cast and crew. Spider-Man was one of my favorite superheroes growing up as a kid due to his sheer ordinary daytime persona and the horrible things he'd have to endure. Yet he'd keep on going, not by relying on his superhuman powers but by getting by with sheer determination along with the love from his family and friends. Thankfully ""Spider-Man 3"" didn't stray too far away from the comic books that it was based on, and was one of those movies that really make you stop to think about the fairness in life. It strives to be more than it is and in most cases, that's exactly what it does. As Stan Lee would say himself, ""'Nuff said!""","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Obviously this movie was made for children with some nice messages for the little buggers about forgiveness and that there is no distintion between good and evil, circumstances might force people to do things and that's an important lesson. Mix that with nice special effects the little guys will get crazy! However, for mature people who had their fair share of movies, you will recognise all the typical cliché Hollywood shots of reunited friends and lost loves. The first half was actually quite interesting and OK written (few clichés you can get away with) but the second half after venom is coming alive was just plain ridiculous. ""I really wanted to like this film"" (another cliché line for many IMDb reviews :-) because Spidey is part of my early memories and first comic book heroes (along with X-men and Batman) but after the second half things started to fall apart. Characters were out of character, easy plot changes to conveniently fit everything, cheesy dialog and typical shots seen in every stupid Hollywood movie, from pearl harbour to Armageddon and millions of action/romance movies copying each other. Anyone could have made that movie, and I mean anyone, even you my dear reader who read so far this review (and that means you have been thinking the same or the whole movie seemed like a deja vu to you) could have made a nice collage of these shots just with different actors and voila!!! damn you sam raimi, i really wanted to see a good Spidey movie, not another typical Hollywood format film....but it's OK, you did halfway I FORGIVE YOU.....","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I really disliked the first film and felt there was not enough action in the second, way to much whining about MJ and ""I don't want to be Spiderman.""Now to finally see him not only except his role as Spiderman and then be a bad ass, granted a little EMO was cool. It reminded me of the now modern Superhero classic of Batman Begins. Although Maguire did ham it up a little, it is a kids movie after all, and that is to be expected. But as with the first two the saving graces are the villains really good choices, the villains this go around are all really cool and well fleshed out, and just kick ass to watch. And the balancing of the 3 villains was amazing and very well done storytelling.

It is plagued with far too many characters, has a plot outline that is for anyone; even the brainiest person complicated, confusing as hell! Spider-man 3 is the superhero movie from hell! There are so many pointless, meaningless scenes, not enough spider-man scenes and too many characters. I did not like the fact that poor Pete could not even propose to his love life Mary-Jane Watson because of a series of unfortunate setbacks; Peter finding out who really killed his uncle Ben, Spider-man kissing Gwen Stacy and a bunch of others. What could have made Spider-man 3 better if it was split into two parts; Spider-man 3.1 & Spider-man 3.2. Spider-man 3.1 focusing on Spider-man/Peter Parker flying around New York City, hanging out with MJ etc etc but Flint Marko's transformation into the Sandman and the Spider-man vs Gwen Stacy kiss at the festival etc toward the end of the film, by this point Spider-man gets the black suit but fling in some extra scenes/bits to make Spider-man 3.1 a feature length film and then in Spider-man 3.2 have more of the dark- natured Black Suit Spider-man scenes attacking Flint Marko, the break-up with MJ in the park scene, the fights with Harry Osborn, the emo dance and the final battle towards the end. But instead of the dance scene at the nightclub MJ works in, Peter fires firework rockets in the nightclub causing multiple casualties in the bar to get back at MJ for breaking up with him under the influence of the black suit at the cost of MJs life just like in Casualty Series 28 Episode 19 ""For Auld Lang Syne"" that aired on Saturday 4th January 2014. After the final battle with Sandman and Venom, Peter develops a new relationship with Gwen Stacy as opposed to re-starting his old relationship with MJ at the end that might have lead to a 'Spider-man 4' but no! They made a film as twisted and as complicated-as-hell and even worse, they frackin' canceled the 4th film over script and villain disputes.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Before this happened, I think that Spiderman is a hero with solid mind.Honestly, I predict that Spiderman 3 will be a very good movie before i watching it. Peter is facing many problems. For example, the problem between his friends, study and being a powerful black Spiderman. However to much problems makes the movie become long and boring. Things are not in detail too.Hoping that the next Spiderman movie will be better.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I much like this one more than the second because this is a perfect balence between action and romance, the second had a lot of heart filled sceans but barley any action, but this is 50% action and 50% everything else, the only problem with this movie is that their is very little of venom shown and thats it.And the three villains was a very nice touch because it keeps you on your seat and doesn't have a dull moment, and they weren't put their for nothing they each had their own part of the story that made it so that they were each just as important as the next.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Spider-Man 3 probably would have been easier to tolerate if the stories were at least engaging and written well, but because everything plays out with the intellectual depth of a soap opera, I was barely able to tolerate it. There is even a character who, conveniently, gets amnesia just so some of the other story lines can have room to move forward. I kid you not.The Sandman is one of the few developed characters in the film. Its too bad the Raimi brothers had to make him into what is, undoubtedly, one of the sappiest villains in movie history. What happened to villains who were evil because they were evil? Why must they also have nice sides? I can understand the need to add depth to the characters, but it seems like the Raimis are afraid to create genuinely villainous villains. The guy either goes crazy or has to help someone. Because Raimi lacks talent as a director, Thomas Haden Church was forced to give this embarrassing and forced 'angry mouth / sad eyes' expression through out the entire film to constantly remind us Marko is angry, but... he also has a soft side. Awwww. I want to give him a hug now.Venom is the only character who truly lacks humanity, but his story is barely explored. From what I read, Raimi didn't even want Venom in the film because of his ""lack of humanity."" Gwen Stacy is another character who just shows up out of no where and does nothing to move the main story forward. And May Parker, Peter's aunt, has become increasingly annoying with her long, drawn out, Yoda sermons on life.In summary: Spider-Man 3 is garbage. Don't waste your money on this pile. If you want a serious comic book film, get Batman Begins.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Peter's old friend Harry Obsourne has set out for revenge against Peter; taking up the mantle of his late father's persona as The New Goblin, and Peter must also capture Uncle Ben's real killer, Flint Marko, who has been transformed into his toughest foe yet, the Sandman.

Peter has to reach deep inside himself to free the compassionate hero he used to be if he is to ever conquer the darkness within and face not only his greatest enemies, but also...himself, the action was amazing, but venom was cool but they killed him off and it was terrble if you are a spider man fan stay away from this terrble movie please don't watch this movie if you like this movie that fine","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The dark satire that was to be expected, probably caused a lot of concern to fans, who would have wondered where the franchise was heading.This definitely shone is terms of maturity. Mary Jane Watson's character has been transposed from girl to woman, and Kirsten Dunst provides the movie with a solid performance, shedding the 'girl next door' image. Unfortunately this cannot be said for Tobey Maguire. Spiderman's character has to remain uniform through-out the franchise, but when Maguire becomes Peter Parker, the same kid is conspicuous form the first installment. This has the writers to blame, cause there were a few scenes, that dealt with Peter's evil transposition which could have been scripted differently. James Franco shines with his charm and his on-screen presence, making his character quite lovable. The same could be said for Bryce Dallas Howard, who shocked me with her portrayal of Gwen Stacey. We see in this instance an actress (whose only mainstream role has been a blind girl in 'The Signs') starting to explore diversity at arguably a commencement point in her career.A brilliant third installment, however lets hope it stops here..! this offered much more than the second installment, and gives a good end to the franchise.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The cartoon was superb. The action, the intrigue, the suspense... The movie is just totally awful. It's more like a romance. For kids??? There must be something wrong with that! It's not comic, it's a stupid and uninteresting love story. I don't get why they make those movies. It's not for adults, not for kids, not for teenagers. The graphics is poor. Spider-man looks totally unrealistic and bulky. And it's in 2007! With many million dollar budget? C'mon! Movement is so stupid, the physics is completely omitted, it's so unnatural, so weird looking. Combat scenes are so poorly written, with no understanding of physics at all, no realism at all. It just makes you wanna laugh. Venom was more muscular (they just used the model that their had I guess, why bother?). Screenplay is awful. The actor's play is bad, the cast itself is bad. Kirsten Dunst is so not Mary J. Tobey Maquire is so not in place. Lynn Kressel and Francine Maisler have done such a bad job. I'm so sorry for GREAT actor Willem Daffoe. Well, there is nothing we can do. I don't get it, do they think that you can just name a movie Spider-Man - and it will be successful? And people will eat it just like that? Don't think so. Is it so hard to go see cartoon series and make it more like it should be? Not a romance comedy. It's one of the worst Marvel movies ever. The original old Spider-man was soooo much better, despite he was a little fat.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In the second, I defeated him, and in the third...I help him.' Well to avoid posting a spoiler, I won't go any further.

The movie functioned like a TV series in that it had a bunch of story arcs to keep the audience engaged and just built on the others very easily at each moment. Unlike the first two movies, with the way the film is done we don't know exactly who's the good guys & who's the bad guys in this film. You think you do but you don't because the characters have to go through some developing stages in the course of the story. By doing so, some things get a little twisted and until they're untwisted, we begin to ask ourselves as an audience where is this story going. it's not confusing, just a little unusual given how we saw the characters in the two, but keep an open mind because we soon recognize who's good and who's evil and how they are stopped. With all its subplot arcs, this movie takes on a completely different turn than its predecessors. Once it's resolved, the ending justifies where the story to this one started at the beginning and completes this story.","2 out of 22 found this helpful.

Out of the many problems the fact that there were too many bad guys aching for screen-time meant that there was no clear story arc for any character, despite some powerful performances. Also, the scenes when 'Spidey goes bad' leave the audience feeling that they've just cringed through an episode of Mr. Bean as opposed to a serious metamorphosis by a malevolent alien.A disappointing experience but due to the success at the box office a fourth film could be likely, hopefully they will iron out the weak spots and bring our friendly-neighbourhood Spider-man back to full strength.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Moreover, i would argue that the cg was less than average, the modeling of characters is done very well (and that's the reason posters and trailers look so cool), however the character movements are very unrealistic, and as always extremely fast fight scene (to hide bad cg) where you can't tell what exactly is going on, except the fact that one guy kicked the other.Moreover, it seems that the less than average director (feel free to quote me on that) was given a free card to let loose of his humor all over the movie and any spider-man fan will be outraged by that kind of humor.So to all spider-man fans ""and good movie fans in general"", let us unite against the making of another spider-man movie and if the world still wants another spider-man movie, could we at least get a better director!!!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Remember in 2 after Petey lost his powers how he was walking down the street to the tune of ""Rain Drops Keep Falling on My Head""??? His lame attempt at poetry to impress MJ??? The elevator scene where he revealed his suit ""rides up in the crotch""??? If that movie wasn't cheesy, I don't know what is. But I still liked it overall. On to SM3...I thought it fit perfectly with the other 2 movies and picked up right where 2 left off. I was not surprised at the ""Bad Peter"" bopping down the street scene because the cheese bar had already been set in SM2. I thought that scene was funnier than anything in 2, as well as the bar dancing scene. The action was much better and more frequent in this one...you don't have to wait for the big scenes like you did in 2 (specifically, the train scene in 2). My only complaints: Why doesn't Sam Raimi let Peter keep his mask on for just one movie??? We get the point--Petey's the man under the mask. But why must he either get his mask taken off or have it torn in half every other scene? It's supposed to be a ""secret"" identity. Second, where was his spider-sense in the movie? That early warning tingling is a major part of his powers, and my complaint in the first two was that he didn't use it enough. In this one, I don't recall him using it at all.

About an hour could be cut without losing anything but seemingly endless shots of Mary-Jane in yet another mood, or suffering from PMT or blubbing from some pointless tiff. Puh-leeze, we just don't care about her. Dump her from the film and you might end up with a decent one-hour action movie where you don't forget who the villains are after yet another ""oh let's go check on how Mary-Jane is coping with yet more angst"" scene. Sheesh...Seems I need at least 10 lines to qualify for a review. But seriously, there isn't anything more to be said about this film. Well OK, let's try...Yeh OK the special effects are good, but then pretty well every film these days comes out with effects, so that's just not enough to impress any more. Maybe that's a good thing since films will be forced to return to what made good cinema in the days before flashy graphics: a decent plot and engaging script.Nuff said.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I believe that the single largest factor that can ruin a _good_ movie is having too high of expectations. The previous two movies set the bar high and I think this caused may people to expect spider-man 3 to be the greatest movie ever. I wish it were, but Spider-man 3 is not the greatest movie ever (or it would have get a 10 :-). It is, however, pretty damn good. I think people were disappointed and became over critical when it didn't live up to the unreal expectation. I also had extremely high expectations, but luckily I read some of the reviews before going to the theater. I say ""luckily"" because after reading the reviews (saying that it was only ""O.K."") I was able to put my expectations back in check before seeing the movie. The final result: I thought Spider-man 3 was awesome! :-)","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I made a promise to myself long ago not to go into films I haven't seen with unrealistic or unfair expectations. It's served me well, and it was no less of a learning experience this time, having heard most every critic and wannabe critic's take on it, several of them negative.I submit to them all, negative and positive, that they're missing the point. Spider-Man 3 successfully does what few films will even ATTEMPT nowadays. More on that later.Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is on cloud nine. Things are finally looking up. As Spider-Man, he is the greatest thing since...well, the internet. A bona-fide celebrity. Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) isn't doing too shabbily, either, having debuted in a Broadway show. Peter sees the perfect timing in finally proposing to MJ, for which Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) entrusts him with a precious family heirloom ring. Harry Osborn (James Franco) attempts the direct approach to exorcising his own demons in a confrontation with Peter, and as a result, becomes friends with him again. But not all is well in New York. Escaped convict Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church) has the heat breathing down his neck as he desperately looks for a way to reconnect with a repressed wife and a critically ill daughter. Meanwhile, upstart photo jock Edward Brock Jr. (Topher Grace) is looking to become Spider-Man's new unofficial PR for the Daily Bugle. Things get more and more complicated as protagonists and antagonists alike cross paths, and wind up learning something about themselves.I'll admit, it won't win any awards, save maybe an Oscar or two for the effects and editing, and some MTV awards for the fights. You've heard it all, I'm sure, by now, so I'll mention in passing that the special effects and animation in this film are truly eye popping. Cinematography is grand, which it ought to be, 'cause this one wasn't cheap. On a basic level, and considering the source material, the story is well-handled; Sam Raimi remains the most capable director as far as taking a comic-book plot, virtually sticking to it verbatim, and making it work in a film format. Everyone earns their paycheck in portrayals--and additions and deviations, where damaging in other franchises, are welcome here. Haden Church gives classic brute Sandman a firm measure of humanity, James Franco must be applauded for his stalwart handling of a highly conflicted character in Harry Osborn, and despite limited screen-time, Topher Grace, yes, I have to admit, did gleeful justice to the wall-crawler's most fascinating adversary.So what's different, you ask? What does Spider-Man 3 do that's so rare and great? The moral. Forgiveness, sadly, is a concept that's rarely broached in either fantasy OR real life. Particularly, at this most cynical time, and in our eye-for-an-eye, litigant-rich society, this is a lesson that kids from 3 to 133 could stand to learn and re-learn. If the cast and crew of Spider-Man 3 would take any pride in anything they've done here, it should be mostly for that. While I felt that the first two films were nicely done, this is the first Spider-Man that I actually wanted to buy.Here's hoping the world's most popular comic book hero has started a long-overdue new trend in storytelling.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Here's just my thoughts on the third movie.Having liked the first two Spidey films, I still cannot decide if having a third Spider-Man was the wrong decision or if this was just poorly made all around. I'm leaning more towards my second thought. The movie seemingly picks up right where the second one left off, but then it just gets weirder and plain weird. The whole emo-Spidey was just bizarre and didn't work in any capacity. I'd rather have him just kill some people to show off his evil side once the symbiote entered his body. I enjoyed the Sandman as a villain, played by Thomas Haden Church. I did not enjoy the 20 or 30 minutes of Venom. I'm sorry, actually I'm not, but Topher Grace does not appear to be a Venom-type actor. Horrible casting on their part. Perhaps if Venom had a bigger role in the film or if they had redone their cast to not feature Topher for the part.5/10 Stars.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I'm not a big fan of movie franchises though and this is a classic case in point for the problems with film series. If I ever buy a box set of Spiderman movies this is (one of) the one(s) that would get played once. The film really doesn't stand up in it's own right. There's a little bit of character development and a couple of interesting sub plots, but it really isn't enough.To be fair I've certainly seen worse films and I do like Dunst and Maguire even if their chemistry wasn't quite as good as in the previous 2 films. It's worth checking out, but not very satisfying. If your part way through watching the all day epic of Spiderman in 2015 you can quite happily go out for a couple of hours between 2 and 4 without missing anything important.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But spidey is spidey ,and the dedication of Sam Raimi allow us to be blowed up and immerse in two and a half hours of drama, vengeance and romance. This is thanks to the great actings( Kirsten dunst one not so much), the stunning visual effects and the fact that after all ,is a spidey film.But the major weak point of the Movie is the scrip, because is a mixture of ideas and characters that sometimes converge but other times gets even cofusing , and leaves the two most interesting villains of the movie (Sandman and Venom)with no screen time ,just a few scenes and no character development( in fact Venom appearance is ridiculous short and even can be consider as an injustice for fans). But despite his strange scrip and the studio pressure and intentions , Spider-Man 3 is a great flick, one great ride that (despite its failures)provides entertainment , loads of entertainment.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Well similar sequences are infused in this one. A couple scenes reminded me more of a musical than a superhero movie. There were no real bad guys in this one. It was sort of by committee. Honestly, I'm not sure what the director was thinking cramming all those subplots into this creating a tedious mess.

Then Spider-man 2 hit. I hate that movie. Why? Well I just found it to be overall ripping off the plot of Superman II...just without Zod, and the awesome presence of Christopher Reeves. Spider-man 2 felt like a wannabe Superman movie with the wrong guy in red and blue tights. That's the short end of why I hated Spider-man 2, there are other reasons.So I wasn't all that psyched when Spider-man 3 started rolling around. I felt like I had to see this movie...because it was required, like jury duty.I went to the midnight showing at my local theater with my Spider-man and general Marvel comics nut of a roommate, and zero expectations. I expected to maybe have a good time.I was generally blown away.Everything I felt was lacking is back in the 3rd movie. I actually care about the characters again. Peter isn't frustratingly stupid and Mary Jane and Harry are not obnoxious like they were in Spider-man 2. The humor works, even if it is over the top sometimes. Watching the three of them interact was entertaining for me.The fights finally felt like something out of a Spider-man comic. Spidey and his villains whizzing, swinging, punching, flailing around. Pure glee for me.Some people claim that the movie was overstuffed with plot. I think that's a pretty subjective argument, and will depend on the viewer, I was never confused, bored, or felt like the plot was being rushed.I also found it refreshing that more time was spent with the hero than establishing the villains. You know enough about them, that's it. They're the villains, they are not any different from any other villains, even if one is a space alien and the other is made from sand, they are still just nuisances.It's like this trend since Tim Burton's Batman to spend half the film with the camera squarely on the villain, taking away focus from the main protagonist. Batman Begins broke this trend and thankfully Spider-man 3 does the same.To sum it up. Spider-man 3 is going to be argued about, some will hate it, some will love it. I loved it and I am surprised I did.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

I wasn't expecting any shakespearian drama, but even for a mindless action flick the ""plot"" was horrible and utterly predictable. The characters (villains and heroes alike) were so one dimensional, they could have come from a soap opera - the characters motives are either nonexistent or worthy of a three-year-old. Sure, comic book characters are usually exaggerated, but the characters in this movie were so boring, I couldn't have cared less about any of them at the end of the movie. Well, and then there's the action sequences. I think movies these days try to heighten the tension by cramming more and more completely over the top stuff into action sequences, which, for me, actually makes more and more boring. Yeah, it's nice to be able to do things with cgi that are impossible to do in real life, but how about keeping the action at least remotely believable? That way you can actually get sucked in and feel the tension instead of thinking ""That looked cool, but I don't buy that for a second"". To sum it all up, this movie was a soap opera with superheroes and totally over the top action - completely unentertaining.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I think that there are many who don't realize the amount of Spiderman's plot that actually revolves around Peter Parker (in the comic). Like it or not, if you watch or read Spiderman, you will be spending a lot of time watching the mediocre life of a lovable nerd.The movie had three villains and each villain had a story behind him. Some of the stories were well thought-out and well-acted. Some of the stories were simply thrown together without much thought. The special effects were strong and the acting, for the most part, was strong as well. The most disturbing personality in the movie is that of Mary Jane (Parker's girlf). As a stage actress, she spends so much time second guessing herself that she destroys her relationship with Parker.Bugle editor J.J.

Seriously, can you name an example where the third movie improves on the first two? A lot of this is to do with the difficulty of trying to move something on yet retain the familiarity that cinema goers expect. Spiderman 3 doesn't really try to move on or even generate a new story arc. The movie doesn't really bring anything new to the table. Of course the special effects are nothing short of astounding. Most of the best bits we've seen in the constant trailers but the story and twisting of themes as Spidey moves over to the dark side are a seriously missed opportunity. One expects that an oddball like Parker would be come seriously deranged and anyone who has seen a real spider edge across it's web to a fly know's that the opportunity for ruthlessness could have been much more entertaining.What we are left with is a reworked storyline touching on all too familiar themes with a bloated budget. Though this makes absolute economic sense, it falls far short of entertainment expectations. Kirsten Dunst suggested they should make Spiderman 4 as a low budget horror going back to Director Raimi's roots, now that would be moving the ideas on.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They seem to all focus around the same thing, too many villains, what the heck is Peter doing Emo, and bad acting. Its like some playground bully talked about this movie because he expected this and that and wanted to look all big and bad. So then all the kids were like, OK better say the same thing over and over again in different reviews so that we can make Spiderman 3 seem bad compared to all the hype it generated. I'm an 18 year old teenage boy who never ever writes these things and never ever really cares about reviews and such because what i like is what i like. But you see all the reviews everywhere and its the same stuff, i am here to say that this movie is absolutely great. The aciton in it is OUTSTANDING and the people who think its ""Way too cheesy"" must be those kids that had a bad childhood, you know dad was always gone for work and they ended up growing up way too fast. It's like every critic expected it to be something Spiderman isn't. Spiderman is designed to focus on a superhero with problems that also happens to find time to save the day. Its intended to show comic book style action and bring out the kid in everybody. Im glad it doesn't live up to the reviewers expectations because they expect Spiderman 3 to be some melt your heart movie soap opera thing that actually tells some crappy love story the way Notebook did while putting one good action scene. Man, its SPIDERMAN!!!! THATS WHY HE IS WHAT HE IS!!! ACTION, EXCITEMENT, AND HUMOR!!! THe movie does great by first of all delivering non-stop action, WAY MORE than the first Two combined. And even though, yes, the actors are a little young, it in no way takes away from the movie experience. The scenes in the movie had the whole audience laughing and at the same time gasping when the times came. It is told like a comic book. It is fun. Critics, lay off. Every REAL person i've asked thinks it rocks. So go enjoy the movie for yourself, and just enjoy it.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I have seen the reviews of people complaining about too much plot and even not enough action. Are we so jaded that we expect the character to actually jump from the film and smack us in the face? I like plot in the film. You can't just throw in the characters with no story line. When all the complainers buy the DVD when it comes out and they will, that is when you fast forward through the slow parts. This movie had a pretty good story line detailing the bad guys and why they turned out the way they did. This movie also had incredible action throughout. I think the amount and type of action was better than the previous two movies and I liked them both. I think this was a great addition to the Spiderman movie legacy. Sure SM3 was over the top, sometimes cheesy, and funny in parts. That is what makes it Spiderman. When I want dark and brooding, I watch Batman.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Of all three, it is undoubtedly the weakest and the most fragile.The script brings together, in a movie, four action figures from the Spider-Man universe: himself, the Green Goblin, the Sandman, and the Venom. The movie shows the birth and clash of the four, and perhaps that's why it all seems a bit forced and cliché, especially in the end. The development of the characters did not have the care and attention to detail we have seen in the previous two films, and the script looks more like an outline than a finished product. I didn't like to see Spider-Man go through a phase of malice, but I understand the reasons and realized by doing some research that comics really give us this story associated with the birth of Venom. So what we saw in this movie has a strong foundation in the original comic books, something I don't despise.Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunst kept up the good work on their respective characters. Dunst, I dare say, even improved her performance from film to film. Topher Grace was an exclusive addition to this movie but seems like a serious and capable actor, but has received little and bad material. Thomas Haden Church did an excellent job as a Sandman. JK Simmons and James Franco kept up well. Bryce Dallas Howard was more unlucky ... her character is basically just a pretty face for Spider-Man to save.Technically, it is the most visual film of the three in this trilogy. Bet everything on impactful CGI. Powerful to the point of clearly being false. Does the movie lose any credibility with this? Well, just because we know well that all we are seeing is done through a computer, green screen and other features. It has great special effects and sound, a range of good camera angles and action scenes to suit every taste.The movie is not brilliant. In fact, as a movie, it is the worst of the trilogy and it is a pity that the director did not give the script the same relevance as he did to the special effects. But Spiderman will definitely be back in the movies soon ...","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I really do not care about MJ and what she's going through, or Venom/Eddie or the Sandman.

Please Hollywood, realize you need real writers in order to tell meaningful stories. Producers and Directors are not always good writers.The dialog is so terribly melodramatic and unreal people in the audience were actually laughing when characters on screen were crying and revealing their innermost feelings.Characters swung from one side to the other, from good to evil, just by hearing a couple of honest words or seeing the light that seemed to come from absolutely nowhere? Okay, the special effects were really good. They keep getting better and better. The Sandman's scenes were especially well done.But what I loved about the last two movies was their integrity in regards to character motivations and emotions.

Unfortunately, this third part goes from bad to worse after these credits.
The first two films in this trilogy are some of the best in the superhero subgenre, but this third installment falls short of those standards.
It is quite strange how the film takes on an increasingly comical and ridiculous tone as it progresses. Sam Raimi abandoned the seriousness of the previous installments of the arachnid, except for some scenes that do have an emotional impact on the viewer.
Something else that can be rescued from this third part is how despite his weak script and absurd situations, Raimi continues to have that innate talent to create sequences full of epicity and heroism, something in which the excellent soundtrack by Danny Elfman also contributes.
In conclusion, this may have been a stumbling block within the franchise planned by Raimi and Sony Pictures, but it was enough to bury this one forever. Sadly, the closure of what could have been a perfect trilogy falls far short of what was expected.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Finally a 3rd instalment is released to complete it's trilogy. It did just that, a decent 3rd sequel, but instead of making it decent, it could have been made brilliantly if some scenes were done with more thought put into it. But still spider-man 3 offers many new features in the series and improved in little but many ways.To start off with something more positive of the movie is always better. You could say that spider man 3 is a little different from the other 2, but not necessarily in a bad way. The fight scenes were better and panned out, simply flawless, best thing about the movie for sure. There was plenty of them too, it's cool to see them mixed too (not always ""spider man"" vs the villain) so yes they were different in many ways. Camera angles were better, punches, kicks, flips and ""super strength"" were exploited better in that case. The plot outclassed the one's from the previous instalments, i'm sure you all seen the trailers or clips, so without ruining it for you. The idea of a ""black suited spider-man (evil) has everyone exploding of what's going to happen in the movie. So yes, definitely the plot was good thanks to new and old villains involved. Even the acting was brilliant, Tobey Maguire is impressive again and does well. Kirsten Dunst and James Franco were good too.Now saying all that, your probably thinking. If the movie offers all that, what could possibly be wrong with it. And i could answer you right now. Wastefull scenes. I can't really explain without adding spoilers so i will keep it minimum. The director (Sam Raimi) just completely went wrong with many scenes, (despite the fact most amazing scenes) plenty of film time was really wasted on nonsense. Instead of the movie being full of intense action it started dragging onto some boring drama or romance scenes, which were never necessary. The movie got dragging and the long duration of the movie was because of wasteful scenes like that, the director maybe just took to much film time on things that really didn't matter and left out on some things that could be more important. Also the way that the ""villians"" got introduced in the movie were too disappointing, they were rushed in the film in strange ways and too quick, like i said because to much film time was wasted. And that's the reason the film's success was cut down.Even though the film shows a lot on negativity, it's still a good instalment to the series and quite fun to watch, different and sometimes cool. A definite one for spider man lovers. But if more thought was put into it it could have been a outstanding trilogy, but unfortunately it wasn't. But still a good flick.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first appearance of the sand man is pretty impressive. The action scenes are lively. There's also a cute bit when Peter turns into a smarmy egotist (over all the dual personality thing was less Jekyll & Hyde than it was The Nutty Professor).The rest of it is all terrible, tedious drawn out dramatic scenes detailing Peter Parker's soap opera-ish troubles.

Even though i was looking forward to this film for a long time, the mixed reviews threw me. But i don't think that there was anything really wrong with the film. Every-one is complaining that 3 villains were too many, but really, they don't overlap until the end, when it's only really 2 against 2. I can understand why this is breaking box-office records. The parts that were meant to be funny had the entire audience wetting themselves, and the serious parts had everyone on the edge of their seats. All of the characters were explored enough and, even though it cost a very fast beginning 45 minutes, the last half made up for it. .Topher Grace wasn't that bad as Venom and, not being a fan of the character myself, Venom was a strong villain. Though not as amazing as the first film, it is probably better than the second film.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I liked S-M 1 & 2 so much I thought S-M 3 would be as good. I was wrong. Too many plots kill this. The acting went way down and this is surprising, but there it was in front of me. Terrible, terrible, and terrible again.The stunts and CGI were good as always, but they had a tendency to go on too long. This reminded me of the director who did the Fantastic Four, with the Silver Surfer. Was it the same guy? Will have to check. I mention this because the scenes where they do the acting thing seemed to be the same, most scenes without background noise and this has me believing they were rehearsing lines. Every talking scene was something dream-like and not in a good way. The only real breath of life in this movie was the villain.Let's all hope and pray there is no Spider-Man 4.Violence: Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: No","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It almost seemed like Sam and Ivan Raimi didn't even like Spider-man when they began writing it. Either they were thinking, ""Good Lord I don't want to do this third movie but if we don't we'll be killed."" Or they were thinking, ""Making super hero movies is the best way to make money in this day and age. We don't have to make it good at all, just pay some people to come up with some cool special effects and plagiarize the 'Every movie cliché Hollywood has ever come up with' screenplay. We don't even have to write it!"" The special effects weren't even that impressive. I've seen better CGI in a Final Fantasy game than they had in the movie. Acting was way below par for every character. It's almost as if the bad review that M.J. got was foreshadowing how bad Kirsten Dunst was going to play her.Bottom Line: Worst movie of the summer three-quals, worst Spider-man movie, and right up there on the list of the worst movies I have ever seen. So bad that I almost want to think that those who made it intended it to be that way, which begs the question, Is this a joke?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's a dazzling achievement in action cinema. That never takes itself too seriously and, though I may have reconsidered at times is, is fully deserving of its five star review. This and the fact that Part cone was a very good film means it's so excruciatingly painful for me to give this film a bad review.But a critics gotta do what a critics gotta do. It's a pretty lousy film focusing solely on the development of Parker and MJ which is far more irritating than you'd expect. Naturally spider-man 3 looks amazing. Its stunningly well made. But like many of 2007's outing it's a hollow attraction. Spidey 3 is neither as dark or as important as the trailers make it seem. Its merely a series of events with no purpose and much like Shrek the third suffers massively in comparison to its predecessors. Really spider-man 3 is just action packed nonsense that will leave the eyes dazzled but the heart 8unmoved and won't have you reaching into your wallet any time soon.Your friendly neighbourhood web-slinger is back, only this time his sunny outlook has become partially overcast in the third chapter of director Sam Ramie's Spider-Man saga. Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, and James Franco return to reprise their roles from the previous two instalments, with Thomas Haden Church, Topher Grace, and Bryce Dallas Howard making their first appearances in the series as Flint Marko (aka Sandman), Eddie Brock (aka Venom), and Gwen Stacy, respectively. Peter Parker (Maguire) has finally learned to walk the middle ground between being the superhero that his city needs, and the man that Mary Jane (Dunst) loves. All is well in New York City until one night, as Peter and M.J. set gazing at the stars, a falling comet streams across the sky and crashes into the ground close by.But this isn't any ordinary shooting star, and upon impact the mysterious space rock is split open to reveal a shape-shifting symbiotic with the power to overtake anything that it comes into contact with. Later, as Harry Osborn acquires his late father's flying board, engineers a powerful new Goblin outfit, and takes to the sky to avenge dad's death, the mysterious space sludge infects both Peter's Spider Man suit and ambitious street photographer Eddie Brock (Grace). His strange new suit giving him a newfound sense of power as it gradually overpowers his personality, Peter discovers that escaped convict Flint Marko was in fact the man responsible for the death of Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). Unfortunately for Peter, Marko has recently acquired the power to morph at will and quickly completes his transformation into the dreaded Sandman.The citizens of New York City must once again call on Spider Man to fend off destructive forces that are far too powerful for the likes of mortal man.In all Spider-Man 3 is far more of a chore than a film, forgetting the simplistic beauty of the first and adding so many webs it's hard not to get tangled. The best advice I could give you is not to expect Spider-Man 2 you'll only be disappointed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Can he repeat the magic a third time? Sad to say, Spiderman 3 is a somewhat confused end to the trilogy. Too heavily reliant on CGI, it feels disjointed, moving from action set piece to discussions about the nature of the superhero to Peter's arguments with his girlfriend with little to apparently link them. The inevitable bad guys appear and disappear again for no particular reason, and the result is a bit of a mess.The lot of the modern superhero is not an easy one. Not only does he have to save the world three times a day, but he has to battle with his psychological motivations, girlfriend trouble and his own personal demons. This time round Spiderman has three villains to contend with, some alien goo which brings out his dark side, and on top of this his relationship's in trouble. Tobey Maguire's geekiness has always grated but he is so pathetic as Peter you just want to shake him. And the sequence where 'bad boy' Peter enjoys his new self- yes, I know it's supposed to be a joke, but I'm afraid it's just risible. Kirsten Dunst does a good job as MJ but she doesn't have the greatest presence, and none of the villains are powerful enough to fill the screen.That is not to say there aren't good ideas. Raimi's films always look fantastic, and Spidey 3 is no exception. There is at least one interesting idea- how does the superhero keep his ego in check when faced with his adoring fans- but it is quickly forgotten in the rush to the next computer animated set piece. Once again, the girlfriend's main role is as bait for the villain to lure Spider-man to save her- feminism lives! The tame ending left me wishing for the good old days when superheroes turned up, beat up the bad guys and went home without so much as a moment's doubt in their heads.Still, millions of people love it, and I'm sure this is not the last we've heard of old Spidey. Next time, I hope someone has the guts to give us an old-fashioned superhero flick and leave the psychology at home.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In the first several minutes of the movie, I was tempted to simply stand up and leave the theater. I stayed only because movies cost money and I could only hope that it would not get any worse from there.I'll put this simply. If you are a big fan of Kirsten Dunst or enjoy the troubled romance shared between her character MJ and Maguire's Peter Parker/Spiderman, than you will have a sheer blast watching this. I'm positive it would be nearly impossible to jam Dunst's MJ into any more scenes throughout the movie without extending the reel.The villain's story lines are thrown together sloppily and cut to very small uninformative pieces that don't even make much sense when run together. For every brief cut-scene that gives you some idea of what is going on behind the antagonist's roles, you are forced to wait through never ending scenes of Peter Parker's very dreary and emotionally turbulent life.The Spiderman story is a backdrop to the Peter Parker story as it always has been in these films. I will simply speak for myself here but I'm sure many true Spiderman fans think the same, no one enjoyed the comics because they wanted to be Peter Parker. At least, not without the Spiderman.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Maybe I've seen one too many cookie cutter movies where this one is the last straw. This movie has all the ingredients to be super bad, but is nicely candy coated with special effects and Spidey image that let it slide up a few notches. The plot was so thick I felt like someone was hitting me over the head with the fat script even at the onset of the movie. Does the movie industry really have such a low opinion of our IQs? The movie does not earn the category of action movie because it is loaded with the melodrama of the relationship of Spidey and MJ. If this wasn't bad enough, they also had to top it all off with a good portion of morale. And, my latest pet peeve, the Americanism; a quick shot of Spidey in front of the American flag and the all American music choice even makes the American in me cringe. Is he really the all American hero? To finish my review, I have to mention the strangest concept in the movie. Even though Spiderman and Venom both wear masks, the makers found 101 creative ways to make them both remove their masks for 95% of the movie. Venom unmasks, not once, but twice just to do a chat with our super hero instead of just attempting to kill him. Apparently, no one is interested in Spidey's identity because even when he lands on the ground, not a soul of the thousands of viewers seems to have a zoom camera. Potential viewers, please chose something more constructive to do with your time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The characters are complex, and their struggles feel real, making the movie more than just a mindless action flick.Overall, Spider-Man 3 is a must-see for any fan of the superhero genre.

He has wonderful if struggling actress/singer/girlfriend Mary Jane Waston (Kristen Dunst), loving great-mother (Rosemary Harris), doing extremely well at college, still working at the newspaper job posing pictures of himself as Spider-Man but he has problems with Harry Osborn (James Franco)... his former best friend. Which Harry still believes that Peter/Spider-Man killed him. But now Peter faces new problems, when an escape convict (Thomas Haden Chruch) is molecularly transformed into The Sandman, an ambitious photographer named Eddie Brock (Topher Grace)... who's after Peter's job and Peter finds himself addicted to an alien fungus that turns Peter/Spider-Man to the dark side.Directed by Sam Raimi (Evil Dead Trilogy, The Gift, A Simple Plan) made an entertaining if plot-heavy sequel to the ever popular ""Spider-Man Series"". The cast are good here... especially Dunst, Chruch, Grace and Bryce Dallas Howard (Who appears in a memorable small supporting role). Director Raimi has fun making Peter Parker an insensitive jerk half of the time... especially when Peter turns into a sleazy (Probably Emo) stud muffin. The main problem with ""Spider-Man 3"" is the screenplay by the director, his brother Ivan Raimi (Army of Darkness) and Two Time Oscar-Winner:Alvin Sergent (Nuts, Ordinary People, What About Bob ?). There's too many storyline, some are never truly satisfying (Like the Eddie Brock or Venom character), the film could have been better written or fleshing out the new supporting characters even more... so the movie could be longer.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has two enjoyable commentary tracks. Commentary one is by the director and cast members:Maguire, Dunst, Franco, Chruch, Grace & Howard. Commentary two is by the filmmakers as in producers, editor and special effects supervisor. DVD also includes an music video, bloopers (some are extremely funny) and an photo gallery. ""Super-Man 3"" is the least entertaining of the three movies so far but i have to admit, it does improve after repeated viewings. It was the highest grossing film of 2007... especially considering the $259 million budget! ""Spider-Man 3"" is still worthwhile. But i think ""Army of Darkness"" also known as ""Evil Dead 3"" is better than ""Spider-Man 3"". B-Movie Cult Star:Bruce Campbell has an terrific small bit in his cameo as the Maitre 'D. Super 35.

At first, when I watched this movie, I thought that it was such a good movie that I was completely satisfied with calling this the finale of the trilogy. But rewatching it, kinda makes me never want to watch this movie ever again. This movie honestly hurts, it is such a disappointment. It's not bad, but it's not good. The plot is all over the place, the acting is surprisingly bad, the characters are extremely unlikable and overall not the best. Like as a movie on it's own, it's completely fine. But I don't know anybody who is watching this movie without watching the previous movies. And that's it's biggest problem, when compared to Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2, it's just disappointment. I like the messages and themes this movie establishes, I think if done well, this movie would've been the best in the movie. But it is executed poorly. Another problem is how many characters are in this movie. In the first Spider-Man, our main focus was on Peter Parker, Mary Jane, Harry and Norman Osborne. In Spider-Man 2, our main focus was on Peter Parker, Mary Jane, Harry Osborne and Dr. Otto Octavius. In Spider-Man 3, our main focus is Peter Parker, Mary Jane, Harry Osborne, Flint Marco, Eddie Brock and Gwen Stacey. That's a lot of characters, but they could've been handled well. Problem is they are not and there is many plotlines that we don't have time to go into. Just watch the movie and you will understand what I mean. And this movie doesn't have the same emotional stakes as the first two movies. Everything happens so fast that I'm not emotionally invested in anything. And Venom is in the movie... that's it. Venom is forced into the plot so that fans would be happy, that was the point. Most of these decisions were by Sony themselves. The director Sam Raimi, tried his best to make an amazing finale, but Sony had to get their greedy hands on this movie and make it bad. Watch it, mostly because of the first two movies. But I wouldn't say it's amazing like the first two. It's perfectly average, which is not the worse.

"9","/10","Uneven but an ultimately satisfying experience","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1673782/?ref_=tt_urv","Okonh0wp","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0204528/?ref_=tt_urv","13 June 2007","Spiderman 3 opened to mixed reviews but I wouldn't consider it a failure of a film. I personally thought it was a very uneven experience at first but satisfying overall. More importantly, it served as a satisfying conclusion to the series.The main problem, I think was that so much was resolved in Spiderman 2 (Harry knows who Spiderman is, Peter and Mary Jane get together, Peter confesses to Aunt May for lying about Uncle Ben's death, etc.) that there was little tension left over for Spiderman 3. That left the first hour of Spiderman 3 boring and uneventful. It started to feel like a teen flick and reminded me that without the superhero element, Spiderman does not have as much to offer in terms of rich and dynamic characters. In other words, I don't feel that Peter Parker, Mary Jane, and Harry are interesting enough characters to base a film around if the superhero angle was taken out of the equation.Therefore, it was imperative for the film to not waste too much time with exposition and get into the superhero dynamics before the audience gets bored, which was the case with me. Once, the film found its groove, things started rolling, however. When Spiderman's suit turned from red to black (I'm sure there's some more technical term for what happened to him that some comic geek would know), you could really tell that Tobey MaGuire was having fun playing against type for the first time in his career. The new additions to the cast were all added in small doses, so as to not shadow the development of the three main characters: Topher Grace's sardonic humor complimented the tone of the series well (his humor sort of doubled that of the newspaper editor who provided much needed comic relief in the first two installments), Thomas Haden Church's character created opportunities for some great special effects work, and I have no major complaints about Bryce Dallas Howard.My final verdict of satisfaction came about ultimately because the ending really was very effective and it's hard to feel satisfied by any ending that you've waited five years and sat through a combined 7 hours of film to see.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However in this case...I never expected anything else than the first two parts of the series provided: an easy and enjoyable combination of fun and action spiced up with small bits and pieces for the comic book connoisseur. And I got it from Spider-Man 3. Maybe I should have wished from something else instead...Because this one tries too much: too many characters, too many cheesy jokes, too many Aunt May speeches and too much bad acting from Toby Maguire and James Franco... Even good performances by Thomas Haden Church or Topher Grace cannot make up for the lack of continuity, depth or focus.Because Spider-Man 3 throws at you a long series of events that hardly make up a storyline much less a movie. The only scenes worth watching are the action ones and I'm sorry to say it but: even the CG doesn't look that good.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It started out with promise, however as it just fell apart after Peter turned into his dark alter-ego. The scenes of Peter's 'transformation' were pathetic and so over-the-top it was ridiculous. They turned Tobey Macguire from a great actor into a joke. I was laughing so hard not with it but at the movie when Peter started to wear black eye liner and turned into an Emo table-dancing moron.

Almost annoyingly so, in fact. Even his longtime love interest, Mary Jane Watson, seems to think he's laying it on too thick and tries to tell him as much in a series of awkward, abbreviated conversations between crime-fighting bouts. Parker pays no mind, of course, produces a string of awful motivational speeches when she needs emotional support and swiftly swings himself straight back onto the singles scene. Well, that didn't take long. Now Spidey is sad again! Just in time to tangle with three(!) competing super-villains, a rival in the workplace and a major league identity crisis.Not unlike its predecessors, Spider-Man 3 has way too much going on, a problem that's ballooned with each subsequent installment. The first two films manage to succeed in spite of this weakness, persevering with a great shared cast, strong character moments and well-earned payoffs. In those films, Pete's best pal Harry Osborn slowly works his way through a patient, simmering villainous turn. Here, he's abruptly hot-shotted in the opening action scene, carelessly reset and cast aside until the finale. Venom is birthed and dispensed in less than an act. Sandman's arc has enough emotional heft to single-handedly carry the counter narrative, but he always feels like a third wheel. Gwen Stacey pops in and out of the frame at random. There's just no room for these subplots to breathe amidst all the frantic competition, the race to grab every last thread and hurriedly weave them into something loosely resembling a story.Maybe with a touch of nuance and panache, a skilled director could have worked a little magic and turned this troubled script into an acceptable early-period superhero flick. Sam Raimi is anything but a nuanced director. At best, he's capable but limited, habitually caught in the act of winking at his own shortcomings in uniquely entertaining ways. No wonder he's best regarded for his gleefully deranged horror movies, where over-stressed people behave irrationally (and a little comically) in high-pressure situations. Under ideal circumstances, he can incorporate his eccentricities into the fabric of a film without negatively affecting its story, but not with so many other jobs on his plate. I'm not sure if the hammy over-acting is his fault or the stars', but I tend to lean toward the former because it's so hopelessly widespread.Nothing feels natural in this film, from the janky dialogue and clumsy delivery to the rushed primary character arc and dated special effects. I can still remember how this felt in the theater, bad enough that I avoided revisiting it for nearly fifteen years, and it hasn't improved with time. I can see bits and pieces of promise dotted here and there, hints that the overachieving Spider-Man 2 wasn't just a fluke, but they're drowned by the hurry to expand an already-crowded universe and get everything back to an unconvincing status quo in time for the closing credits. Disastrously inept.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The music in the movie was PERFECTLY executed and GREAT orchestra music and i can definitely understand the 270 million dollar budget.

Sandman actually is a very good actor in the movie and shows very good emotions when it comes to his daughter, and protecting her. Despite what everyone says, Venom was a very well made character.

Having recently re-watched it on DVD, I can see the MAJOR problems with it which I will list numerically.1. Too many villains. Remember way back when Spider-Man 1 and 2 had only 1 villain? That's how focuses the films were. You got into their heads on what they were feeling and their evil plans were and etc. But they were also well-developed characters and the audience cared for them as things went along. Sandman was the only character that was developed and was simply awesome. Too bad the same can't be said for Venom and New Goblin; they pretty much was window dressing.2. The acting. Thomas Hayden Church was wonderful as Sandman and did a great performance but the most laughable part is the emotional scenes between Peter and MJ. Stiff, fake, constipated is what comes to mind with these scenes; hell, it might as well have been scripted for a sitcom.3. The humor. Spider-Man 1 and 2 had great sense of humor. Not this time. It's more on the lines of ""McHale's Navy"" kind of humor. The kind that makes you want to bang your head on the table or against the wall if you're so inclined, which I don't recommend you do or I'll be blasted for promoting self harm.4. Peter acting like a doofus instead of being the bad-ass, evil villainous persona when he's under control of the symbiote. Venom was NEVER like that in the comics or animated series. In Spider-Man: TAS, he was very close to his comic-book counterpart. This version of Venom in Spider-Man 3 is more of a creepy Pee-Wee Herman rather than a alien symbiote.5. Gwen Stacy. Though I liked her in this film as well as the reboot, I felt she was unnecessary in this. She didn't do much in the film and after the dinner scene at the restaurant, which was admittedly funny, she was completely forgotten about; never to be mentioned again.There are so many things wrong with this movie that I simply can't list them all. If you liked this film, fine, more power to you. But this one's a stinker for many of the reasons stated above. I'm glad that they rebooted the series after this because studio interference, NOT Raimi, ruined this film. It made a lot of money at the box-office but to be honest, Spider-Man 3 is nothing more than a comedy of errors.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Not much to recommend here. While i can't say i'm especially fond of the first two, they are well reviewed, this however....isn't.....correctly i might add.
Tobey Maguire is limited and can't stretch to show different side of an ""affected"" Spiderman. James Franco continues to garner my ire. Kirstin Dunst is passable but better than this. Willem Dafoe is underused again though perhaps mercifully as I was always unconvinced by this character. Bryce Dallas Howard is wasted, as is Elizabeth Banks. J.K. Simmons is the only relief in this dull affair but given what he showed himself capable of elsewhere they would have been better making the film about him.
The characters are one dimensional. The plot is hopeless and full of holes. There's no shock or suspense. However, I watched this in UHD and the CGI holds together reasonably well, particularly Venom and Sandman. Neither are well acted in their normal form, but these villains are the best of this trilogy so it's a shame the rest of the movie doesn't raise it's level.
At this point Spider Tobey was a spent force and in the hands of Sam Raimi, deflated the goodwill built up in what was for many, an acceptable franchise. FOUR","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Everything was arranged so it would be convenient for the script writer to introduce a character, move from one inconsistent scene to another etc.. Take for instance, Eddie Broch showing up just when Gwen Stacey is hanging on for her dear life from a building, and capt. Stacey her dad is right there too ! Or Mary Jane showing up at Peter's apartment day after she walks out on him night before at a restaurant, and says ""I'm worried about you."" then she goes on and dumps him again at the bridge. What's going on with this chic ? This is just to swing the mood of Petar Parker so story moves forward ? Alliance between Venom and Sandman wasn't very convincing either. Why do these guys need to team up ? and at the end Sandman has another change of heart and turns into a good guy.For me, character of Mary Jane Watson was a disappointment. If you know the original character of MJ, Kristin Dunst just isn't her. I'd say Tobey McGuire really isn't Pete either. He doesn't come across as a New Yorker to me.So compared to the first two Spiderman movies, this one really didn't have the fire it could have.

I like the Spider-Man franchise. So it just being a Spider-Man movie it automatically gets a good vote from me (unless it somehow got dropped into the hands of that guy who ruined Daredevil -- eesh). That said as far as sequels go, this one captured the camp and fun of the original Spider-Man TV series as well as being up to date, exciting and having a popcorn friendly plot. I had the Spider-Man comics where he got and lost the black costume and other than the cheesy cream filled donut of an asteroid bit (seen Slither anyone?) it followed canon pretty well. What people obviously seem to be wanting is a gripping epic Spidey/Venom saga a la Todd McFarlane era but this is clearly drawing on the less slick, more goofy, pre-McFarlane era books. Admittedly the Sandman plot wasn't as emotionally deep at Dr. Octopus, and I agree with my good pal that the Harry plot was about the best it had going and losing one subplot to give it more room would have been a bit better. In a structural sense the movie needed the double jeopardy of the two villains to bring the whole thing around. Even though the plot was a bit crowded it was still easier to follow than the Pirates sequel. So definitely a good installment of the franchise, sorry to hear it will likely be the last Maguire/Raimi install (another reason it was so jam packed) but definitely a far cry better than almost all of the crap out there these days. And those saying it is the worst of the series, I dare them to try to remember the 'good points' of the second one. Not many. This one had far more 'ooooh' moments.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Really, it's only 13 years, but that's two whole Spidersmens ago !With his life finally in some form of balance, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) happens upon an entity from another world, an alien symbiote that bonds with him and increases his powers. But with his snazzy new black suit comes increased aggression, arrogance and violence - all of which affect Peter's personal relationships. Meanwhile, Flint Marko (Thomas Haden Church), a smalltime criminal who was involved in the death of Uncle Ben (Cliff Roberton) escapes from prison and goes on the run, he inadvertently falls into an experiment with the particle effects of sand and becomes changed on a molecular level.Whilst not perhaps as bad as its reputation would have you believe, ""Spiderman 3"" is a film full of terrible moments. Its nadir is the oft mocked ""finger guns"" Jazz piano dance scene. I've seen people jump through hoops to justify it recently, but it's truly one of the most cringeworthy moments I've seen at the cinema. It's not the only flaw with the film, occasionally, particularly early on - the CGI work isn't very good, even for the time, it's worse that what we've seen in the previous entries. It's also both too long with too many characters, but lacking somehow in a genuine story. Or even a real theme, there's a bit of a redemption arc for Harry Osborn via that most hokiest of plot devices, temporary amnesia, but everyone else ends pretty much where we found them.It's not irredeemably awful though. The performances are still OK. The Daily Planet sections are wonderful. The fight scenes are pretty solid stuff and after you're through the first couple of scenes the visual effects, particularly the particle stuff with The Sandman is really good.The bad, unfortunately, outweighs the good though, and ""Spiderman 3"" was a sour end to Raimi's trilogy. Here's hoping the Doctor Strange sequel can put one of superhero cinema's earliest cinematic heroes back on top.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Let's start with the bad things: the acting hasn't improved at all, Tobey is trying hard, he's not bad, but ain't a Christian Bale. Thomas Haden Curch performs well as Sandman, Kirstem Dunst gives the same solid performance like in SM1 and SM2. James Franco is good and the others hasn't got big role. The script is very crap some place, we got dialogs in Lucas-level, but hey, is SW so popular for it's screenplay? Don't think so. Spidey 3 has so many plots and characters, 3 villains, so we doesn't have deep feelings for the characters, they are not so complete, like Doc-Ock was in Spidey 2. There are some clichés, Ant May is very boring, Venom has just a small part. But the movie works. Hell yes, it rocks. Yeah, there are too much love story, but the whole movie is a great ride. You can find so many mistakes if you want to criticize the movie, but let's not forget one thing: It's ENTERTAINING, if you expected more, watch Batman Begins again, if you want to see a great action-packed summer movie, lean back and ENJOY the movie. Spidey 3 is very funny, I know that that part when Peter Parker goes crazy, changes his hair, does extreme things, will split the audience, but we all know that we do not see the real peter, the black suits causes this, but folks, that scenes are very funny. the music is great, maybe the best score of the 3 movies. The first battle between Spidey and Green Goblin is spectacular, but too fast, you hardly see anything, but if you get used to 24, you won't recognize anything. :) The born of Sandman and Venom is amazing, actually all the Sandman fights are eye-popping action scenes. The last battle, containing Spidey, Goblin, Sandman and Venom at the same times is also very good, there's just one things: Venom kidnaps MJ, the scenes are great, just we have seen this before. But there are some very powerful scenes. If you find excuses like why Spidey takes off his mask or how becomes Sandman Flint Marko again, then you decided to blame Spidey before seeing the movie. It's not the movie of the year, but worth the money. If I had to choose between Spidey 2 or 3, I would say that at home I prefer Spidey 2, and I think that's the better movie, but in the cinema, I'd rather watch Spidey 3 three times more. It was made for the big screen. Do not miss it!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"3","/10","What Was the Movie Called Again?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2971525/?ref_=tt_urv","Flip_McTwist","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23732141/?ref_=tt_urv","28 February 2014","On August 18, 2002, the first Spider-Man movie was shown in theaters. It made $821 million worldwide with two Academy Award nominations: best sound and best visual effects. On June 30, 2004, Spider-Man 2 came out. It made $783 million worldwide with three Academy Awards nominations: best sound, best sound editing and best visual effects, which it won. The studio then released a preview one year before its newest movie, Spider-Man 3, and it became extremely popular on You Tube. I had the enormous privilege of seeing this movie on May 4, 2007, at the midnight showing. When the credits rolled up at the end of the movie, I was dissatisfied, but why? I tried to come up with reasons why I disliked the movie. My answer came after I walked out of the theater and overheard a conversation. One person stated, ""The movie was that close to being a chick flick."" Well it wasn't ""that close"". It was that. The creators of the movie completely forgot this film was called ""Spider- Man"", not ""Peter Parker"". The filmmakers put too many villains into one movie, which led us out of the main plot. Plus the dull acting from Toby Maguire and others was awful and embarrassing to watch.The first part of the film shows us that Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter Parker (Toby Maguire) still love each other, as if that was not obvious in the first two movies. Peter thinks he's now ready to ask Mary Jane to marry him, but like every other romantic film, problems arise and they do not get married. But wait, it gets worse. Peter's ex-friend, Harry (James Franco) still wants revenge for his father's death. So, how does he do it? Torture him? Kill him? No. He attacks his heart. Harry forces Mary Jane to tell Peter she does not love him anymore, and Peter Parker buys it. This is just the beginning of this sweetheart movie. Peter starts hitting on other girls and tries to make Mary Jane jealous. Of course, the movie ends with Spider-Man saving Mary Jane and they finally realize they were meant for each other. So let me ask a question: does it take three movies for us to realize that or did we know it from the first scene of Spider-Man 1?Now even if the romance part of the movie was likable, the action was not. The movie had too many villains. There was the Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), who turns out to be the real killer of Peter's uncle, Ben. Of course, there was Peter's ex-friend, Harry, and then the late added villain, Venom (Topher Grace). So in total, that's three villains? Sounds like this could be a fun film. It's not. The movie went with four story lines: three villains and the hero. Harry and Peter were explained in the previous paragraph, so now let's talk about the other two villains. The Sandman, whose real name is Marco, has a daughter, named Penny, who's infected with some sort of illness, but we never find out what it is. Then there's Eddie Brock, who half way through the film becomes Venom. According to most polls and surveys, Spider-Man fans love Venom the most, yet we did not see much of Venom in the film. The movie had so much information, we did not know what we should walk away with. It shifted away from the main plot when it needed to focus more on the conflict between Peter and Harry.The worst part about the entire movie was the acting. Let's start with Toby Maguire. When I was watching this movie in the theater, whenever Maguire would get emotional, everyone laughed at him. Maguire's acting and facial expressions were so lame, it was slightly burdensome to watch. The Sandman, however, had absolutely no facial expressions. Every expression was exactly the same. When he was sad, he frowned. When he was angry, he frowned. Poor Eddie Brock just had dull lines. In one scene, when Eddie had Spider-Man tied up, Peter tells Eddie that he needs to take off the Venom suit because its enormous power is controlling him, to which Eddie replies, ""I like being bad. It makes me happy."" At that moment, the whole movie turned from a chick flick into a kid's movie.There are two questions that still hold for this movie: was there anything good in this movie, and could it have been done better. Although I may have criticized Spider-Man 3 throughout this paper, there were some moments in the film that worked out nicely; like the one scene at the French restaurant, where Peter was going to hide his ring for Mary Jane in a glass of wine as a surprise proposal. It was a humorous scene allowing us to laugh for a purposeful reason. The film also had esteeming, valuable life lessons, especially at the end of the film when the Sandman explains to Peter that he only robbed to support his daughter. He also explained how killing Peter's uncle, Ben, was an accident. The Sandman only asked Peter to understand, but instead Peter forgives him. We should always be forgiving instead of seeking revenge. Now, could they have done a better job on the movie? Of course they could have. All they really needed to have done was to get rid of some of the distractions in the film to make room for more Spider-Man action. One of the villains needed to have been let go; either the Sandman or Venom. Some of those scenes with Mary Jane having problems with Peter should have been cut, but most of all, the writers definitely needed to fix those corny lines. The overall summary to this movie: disappointing.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I should note that having just started studying film at university, I haven't been exposed to many 'block busters' within the past couple of months, in fact I've only really been watching the so-called classics of cinema. So to go from films like Raging Bull to Spider Man 3 was quite a shock. However, despite all its very significant failures, I think that absolutely everyone should go to see this movie because of one incredibly entertaining part: seeing Tobey Maguire as emo.I suppose no review is complete with out a synopsis of the film. I can only say that Spidey once again faces trials and tribulations while attempting to save the world and manage his own personal life. Really the plot of Spider Man 3 is a lot more complicated than that. Not in the sense that there are many inter-playing elements that contribute to the action, but that things simply occur one after the other until you don't know what the central plot really is! This is THE major fault of the film. It's simply too long. There is enough stuff in it to fill three films! As soon as one issue is resolved and you think the film is about to end, something else happens and then something else and then the original issue somehow comes back again. And it continues like this over and over. After a while, everyone starts to look at their watch...The two and something hours turn into what seem like 3 plus hours.Meanwhile, the exhausting action is not supported by either good acting, interesting dialog, an appropriate score, not even an satisfactory jokes. The dialog, for example, is very cliché and fails to envoke any sought of reaction from the audience. Its delivery is nothing short of laughable. The leading actors may be bearable but the supporting cast is absolutely shocking, a group of amateurs... These elements when combined together produce something more along the lines of a comedy than an action film. It's one of those movies that is so horrendously bad that it's actually extremely funny. I found myself wondering whether the film makers had had enough of the Spidey series and were purposefully taking the p*ss out of it. Either that or they were all on crack because no-one in their right mind can believe that Spider Man 3 is by any standards a quality film. Even by Hollywood standards this film is poor. The CGI, or graphics or whatever they use for the action sequences, was very poorly done I thought. I, who know nothing about this stuff, could see exactly which parts were computer generated. Same goes for the special effects, which were far from believable. For a film with such a large budget and, I assume, access to the most modern technology, this is very poor. Overall, not a very promising picture. So why then should you see it? Well, one part of the film for me completely redeemed everything else about it. Without revealing plot details, the part involves a change in Spider Man with some very entertaining results. Tobey Maguire demonstrates his abilities as an actor by taking on a completely different role. In particular, the physical transformation is stunning, kudos to the make-up department. Tobey becomes one hell of a sexy emo-looking kid. Honestly, I think he should adopt this style permanently. It certainly won me over! For these brief sequences everyone should watch Spider man 3. I have never seen anything more entertaining!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There were so many mixed reviews. But those questions were answered with a slap at my face! This movie comes together so nicely.This is the most underrated, under-appreciated movie I can remember from the past 2 years. For all the people that said there was too much were right for the wrong reasons. Yes there was a lot going on, but that's what you would expect after blockbuster hits from the previous 2 movies. It has to raise expectations from the last 2. The Return of the King was better than the other two because it was the last, had the most action, and a lot of stuff was going on. This movie does that and then some. How Venom became Venom, and how spiderman is having trouble with everything from friends to his girlfriend and how sandman was fit into the plot(can't tell!) all fits together nicely.The acting was good except when peter was trying to act cool. I don't know but it just made me feel awkward.....The action scenes were just as good as the 2nd movie. It didn't really blow me away but it did keep my eyes locked on the scree.Overall this movie is a must see even if you're not a big fan!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

He is now simply a show, a clown in a circus with no background. He is using his spidey webs for impressing his girlfriend M.J by making a large web within the N.Y's green buffer for them to stare the stars and making his millions of female following wish for the same. If spidey-1 was great introduction and spidey-2 was the best superhero movie ever then this time the creators decided on milking the friendly neighborhood (cow) Spiderman with asking for more thrill and stunts. So in this movie spidey saves more damsels than ever ,whom we all together forget in the climax, fights with more number of villains and also jiggles and woo girls along the streets of Manhattan like john Travolta in Saturday night fever!!!aahhh!!! As the story goes Parker is ready to pop up the question to M.J. But Harry Osborne has different ideas. But that is not enough we need more or the marketing team needs more emotions to flow. So there is twist in the murder of parker's grandfather, the real killer has ran away and due to some scientific experiment has become the Sandman. But that also is not enough so a biological virus from outer space has taken over our spidey and has made him the villain within himself, so he should now also fight with himself and when that is removed the virus takes over his professional rival, who wants to destroy guess whom! SSPIDEYY!! Isn't that just great. So this time spidey has no time at all he has too much on his hands actually more that he could bite. Oh and in the mean time I guess the script has been misplaced and the stunt and special effect guys are giving the direction.This spidey potboiler is for the die hard spidey lovers. Each and every plot is half baked and none of it has got enough screen time to blossom effectively. The climax was the most overdone and was also a bit childish and made no sense. Go and watch if u really care for spidey.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Don't worry friends, this movie is in essence equal, and worth of the other two. The difference is, to my impression, you're getting two Spidey movies crammed into one. By now fans are too familiar with the vertigo-inducing action sequences, and the video game- ish FX. They decided to try something new: Even more vertigo-inducing sequences, video game-ish FX and not one, but three supervillains to fight (3 1/2 if you count the Symbiote). These changes work with mixed results. As I said earlier, the movie had enough material to do Spider-Man 3 and 4. There are plenty of story lines and subplots coming even from issues not solved in the first movie. By the end of the movie, not only old issues will be solved, but new ones too. We'll know by the end if Spidey best friend, turned nemesis will be able to forgive him, if Spidey is able to forgive his uncle's killer, if he can put his girlfriend before himself, if he can resist being seduced by his own power... in short, all the cards will be played here. It's a little sad because to me the magic of the other two is they left me wanting more. With all this, the Symbiote storyline, which deserved a whole movie for itself, was underdeveloped. Little we know about the Symbiote and it's second host: Eddie Brock/ Venom, the most underdeveloped character of the movie. Still, almost every other character has a moment to shine. This includes surprisingly tender scenes involving the villains. One of the villains' story was quite moving. In the supporting roles, J.K. Simmons and director's Sam Raimi's most reliable actor: Bruce Campbell, provide some comedy to the cause. So let's review: It has action, it has comedy, it has drama, it has romance. What's not to like? Sometimes it bites a little more than it can chew, but critics, you got it wrong again.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Fortunately, I got out of it. This third installment by Sam Raimi and Tobey MacGuire shows a lot of misfiring of the web as well as the execution of a disjointed screenplay. Spiderman/Peter Parker is riding high on his success. He is planning on proposing to Mary Jane Watson. However, following a disappointing opening night and being replaced, she is down in the dumps and Peter has no clue how to help her. At the same time, an alien symbiote has fallen to earth in a small meteorite. Also, Flint Marko escapes from prison. A person who was complicit with the death of Ben Parker, he falls into the midst of a scientific experiment that turns him into the Sandman. Harry Osborne, the Green Goblin II, is still planning his revenge against Peter Parker/Spiderman. They fight, and Harry gets amnesia, forgetting his feud with Peter/Spidey. He starts dating Mary Jane. Also, a new photographer, Eddie Brock (Topher Grace), gets on at the Daily Bugle and starts annoying Peter Parker. Furthermore, Gwen Stacy is a new friend of Peter, and Brock likes her. Eventually, the symbiote gets on Peter, taps his dark side, but then ditches the new suit that merges with Brock and becomes Venom. If you can't follow that story, then you get the problem. The movie tries to do way too much with a huge, disjointed story, and too many characters. Ironically, all the performers give great, credible performances with the loose screenplay. Raimi even does a good job at directing the actors and characters, but has trouble with the labyrinth screenplay. He does well with the juxtaposition of Venom and Sandman as one is redeemed, but the other isn't. He handles ideas of forgiveness as well. Where Raimi and MacGuire fail is when Peter Parker gives into the dark side with the symbiote suit. It becomes ridiculously silly. Then, as the Symbiote attaches itself to Eddie Brock to become Venom, it is clear that Topher Grace was terribly miscast as an evildoer. The worst part is the campy ending that somewhat rivals the Batman and Robin fiasco. No, this is not a complete disaster, but it cannot be rated as a masterpiece, either.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Like the previous two films, there's a tremendous amount of nostalgia attached to this film for me. This was the first trilogy of superhero films that I connected with, and at 13 years-old I was willing to forgive many of the mistakes this film made, most of which I cannot forgive a decade later.Only a few films have tried balancing more than one villain, Spider- Man 3 being the classic example of how not to do it. Apparently, the studio forced Venom on Sam Raimi and hence making Harry & Sandman's arc far less effective when the final act is bogged down by a silly attempt at bringing Venom to the big screen. None of the three villains are all that great, but there's at least some emotional undercurrent with both Sandman and Harry. Venom is, more or less, just a third act reveal that is meant to please fans. Only, it did the exact opposite.Another thing that definitely didn't win over fans was the fact that this film made Peter Parker an absolute jerk. It's one thing to have the symbiote change Peter, but it's another thing to have him physically abuse Mary Jane, and nearly kill his best friend Harry multiple times. This was far from the Peter Parker we came to love in the first two films.Another headache was the direction they took Harry Osborn. Having him get ""hit in the head"" and lose his memory for half the film was one of the stupidest and laziest decisions I can remember from a comic-book film. I don't mind having Harry go the villainous route, but the memory loss was all a bit of a headache.There is good, however. Raimi, as he proved in the first two, is great at shooting high-scale action. The CGI is definitely dated when looking back on it after 10 years, but the action is as visceral as anything in any Spider-Man film to date. Yes, that includes 'Homecoming'. If only the dialogue surrounding the action could match the brutality. I also think Thomas Haden-Church's performance as Sandman is nothing to scoff at, reminding me of the character depth that made Doc Ock so memorable. At the end of the day, Raimi was trying to give us a Spider-Man film that dealt with bigger and more important personal issues, whether that worked for you or not is entirely up to the viewer.I think if Raimi had the tools that filmmakers have now (improved CGI) and perhaps a little less studio interference, then Spider-Man 3 could be a much better end to the trilogy than it ended up being. There's plenty I can't forgive about this film, especially the infamous 'dancing in the street' sequence, but I don't think it's anywhere near as bad as people make it out to be.+Action+Deals with real issues-But is sometimes careless in its execution-3 villains proved to be way too much-Memory loss for Harry5.8/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The storyline was good and the actors were good as well, especially Topher Grace who was good as Venom/Eddie Brock. But the story and screenplay could have been more developed. And the ending was rubbish. I have a way the ending could be a lot better for example, Dr. Connors still kept the symbiote sample, this could have easily bonded with him, grew back his missing arm and turn him into the lizard. That ending would have been a great cliffhanger to work from so to develop Spider-Man 4.

Unfortunately there is no material in the script to dignify a remarkable cast that honors the comic book characters to the millimeter. Despite the fact that many years have passed, here we have the best possible version of Venom. It is a film that adds a sense of annoyance because there is an unwanted surrender (Green Goblin's), a desired surrender (Sandman) and a sense of professional competition between Parker and Venom's that could have been presented in a better way. The ending is good but the tone of the film is forced and does not hypnotize or make us fall in love.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Probably the worst superhero movie I have ever seen and I really liked the first two. Too many villains, and Peter Parker's social ineptitude is getting really old. At the end I didn't really care about any of the characters, although the Sandman villain was the most interesting. It will take some real damage control to get people to think Sam Raimi is the genius they said he was after the first two films.

The stunts, special effects, performances and action sequences and the villains are the main attraction here, although one should feel slightly disappointed that we don't get an adequate amount of Venom in this installment and we get too much of the Sandman. The character developments (in a way) lack depth and not very much is explained, especially for the Sandman, who at points, can be punched through, knocked through the air and even transform into a huge sand-monster. Spider-Man 3 is a great installment in the series and fortunately it doesn't really fall victim to the ""Third Installment Curse"" which has consumed Star Wars, Batman and Superman entries, but it has it's flaws. Spider-Man 3 is an adventure that will wow you and tickle your eyes and it's actually enjoying, but if you think too hard about it or view it with a closed, too serious mind, it won't be really great. ****1/2 out of *****","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Spidey 1 was great and spidey 2 was even better. So when they announced spiderman 3, I could barely wait. I was probably looking forward to this movie more than any others. And so was everyone else. I expected it to be completely awesome. But somewhere it fell short.So the movie starts out pretty slow. Most movies have an action scene in the beginning to get you pumped up and then delve into the action. Not here, You get about 20 minutes of talking and then a 5 minute action scene, then another 30 minutes of talking. And another action scene. And even some of the action scenes where somewhat unimpressive, as if they had been thrown in there just to give you a break from all the drama. So the pacing of the movie was the biggest problem.Another problem is sandman, He seemed like a pointless character and should have been thrown out so they could focus more on venom and new goblin. Because everyone just wanted to see venom, and in the end he was only given like 10 minutes of screen time.Now all of the bad stuff aside. There were some good points. The special effects were spectacular and some of the action scenes where just amazing. And the ending was probably one of the coolest climaxes I have seen in any super hero movie. It's really a shame that they didn't give venom much screen time because they portrayed him perfectly.Overall it was a decent movie on its own but It did not live up to the high expectations. If they had just cut some of the drama and put in more action it could have been so much better. For my rating I give it a 5/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Spider-Man 2 brought around the unfortunate villain Dr Octopus and with that one of the most stunning graphically enhanced action sequences ever seen in a comic book adaptation: the train sequence. Absolute brilliance in all terms for adrenaline, visual and shock. The story wasn't bad either as Parker debated his purpose in life.Trying to follow the bonds of its predecessor Spider-man 3 takes a sentimental issue of friendship and love whilst juxtaposing real life with some tough villains.Yes, there is an awful lot happening here. Parker's fame, Watson's career, Osborn's loyalty and there are a host of new protagonists to contend with. So at a good 2 hours 20 minutes there should be sufficient room to cram everything in? Well this is where the fabrication and good intentions to fulfil fan's expectations starts to unwind. There is simply too much going on with little focus on the significance of situations. Everyone has their own story to tell, which is fair enough but when mingling them all together everything just feels too perfect for the story's own good. Like Marco's involvement with Ben Parker. Like Peter coincidentally in the same place as Eddie Brock with Venom. It all fits too perfectly to be unrealistic. Not to mention a vast majority of the dialogue is clunky and cheesy.But this is not all doom and gloom. If you forget the clunky scripting you see some well choreographed fighting, some established visuals and perhaps the funnier side of any of the films in the series. Whether you are a critique or a spider-man fanatic, there is no denying the spectacle of this Raimi picture. It is enjoyable and an obvious watch if you enjoyed the first two releases.Raimi is once more on form and handles the script as best as he can. The early shot of MJ and Peter on the web looking at shooting stars is a bit awkward romantically but the unfortunate crane sequence is well handled.Despite the plot this is a sharp fun film with once more stunning action and fantasy.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Spider-Man 3 is not good and not worth the money either. I love Marvel movies, too...seriously, this is the worst one since ""Elektra""....and I'm a Jennifer Garner fan! Wait for it to rent. Get it cheaper...and that way if you don't like it you can turn it off and watch something else.The previews were better than the actual film. And the previews of future movies before ""Spider-Man"" started were better than the feature presentation. Fantastic Four looks INCREDIBLE, and there were a few other good looking flicks coming soon. But basically, I just spent 2 1/2 hours of time in that movie where I could be sleeping or studying...2 1/2 hours spent in a hot, stuffy cinema with a bunch of college kids who mostly didn't like it either. Seriously. 'Twas bad.If you REALLY want to see it, don't read this review. But I'm telling you: It's like the time me and my mum watched ""Bewitched"" with Nicole Kidman and Will Ferrell...except this time I couldn't turn the DVD off and watch Mary Tyler Moore instead. It has the newest three Star Wars-type dialouge (translates to: BAD AND Corny AND CHEEEEEESY!) and I was fully expecting Mary Jane Watson to say, ""Peter, you're breaking my heart,"" at some point in there. It had a lot of Phoebe Buffay moments (""Oooh no"") but more ""MAN ALIVE, GET OVER YOURSELF!!!"" to all the characters, but mostly directed to Harry and Peter.Definitely not worth taking the wife and kids to, I'll tell you that. Spider-Man fans will be sorely disappointed.

This is Peter Parker's biggest challenge yet. Along with relationship issues with his friends Harry and Mary Jane, he has 3 villains to overcome- Sand Man, the New Goblin(This is Harry's conflict) and Venom.Once again, he has to battle villains with daily life, causing numerous issues for Peter to resolve by himself.I personally really enjoy this movie. To me, Spider Man 3 really works like Magnolia or Love Actually, a movie with numerous plots intertwined with each other.As I already mentioned, he has 3 villains and 2 relationships to deal with. I see this as a plus and a flaw. It's a plus because it gives Spider Man a challenge unlike any other. How do you challenge Spidey? Give him more villains!However, the movie WOULD work better if a couple of those plots were removed and was saved for a 4th movie or, honestly, just scrapped.When it comes to what makes SM3 work, that would have to be with the story. It's web of plots aside(no pun intended), it's still very entertaining. There's also many action scenes that are thrilling, like when a building almost crumbles with Gwen Stacey inside.I enjoyed a couple other things as well. There's also a heartfelt scene near the end when Peter Parker forgives Sandman for something I won't spoil, and Harry repairs his friendship with Peter, and they work together to save the day, which is really satisfying.I'm giving the movie a 9 because of certain minor flaws that keep it from being a 10 like the first 2. I have 6, so I will list them now in no order:(SPOILERS POSSIBLE):1. There is a scene where Peter and Mary Jane have a break up. They both cry, and it's very corny looking, to the point that I cringed. The break up is fine. The crying need to be more realistic and less corny.2. There is a scene where Harry winks at Peter and disappears. Where did he go? Was it imagination? We don't know, and maybe that was the idea, but it's still quite annoying.3. Harry tells Peter that he loved Mary Jane too. Why though? Why wait 3 movies to say this? It's hinted in the Thanksgiving scene of the first movie that he likes her, but does it take 5 years and 2 more movies in real time to have him to confess this?4. The Goblin, an evil Spider Man, kidnaps Mary Jane and, seeing how hot she is, says ""My spidey senses are tingling!"" Even as I type this I shutter at how disgusting that line is! That's not a flaw like a plot hole, but I could live without the line.5. Peter and Harry have a fight 19 minutes in(That's easy to remember because there was exactly 2 more hours of the movie), and Peter tries to tell him that his father's death from the first movie is not his fault. Harry completely ignores this and tries to punch Peter. Because Harry ignores this, we have a conflict that extends much longer than it needs to.6. Finally, the movie ends with Mary Jane and Peter resolving their problems, but then it just ends. The 2nd movie ends with MJ leaving her wedding for another man to confess her love for Peter. Shouldn't this one end with their own marriage? Because of this, the end kind of left me cold.Despite these flaws that I have with the trilogy's conclusion, the action and exciting plot outweigh this, making for a worthwhile movie. Sure, it is without a doubt the weakest movie, but that doesn't mean it's awful.Spider Man 3 satisfies as a conclusion, but it also shows why good things must eventually come to an end.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I don't know very much about comic books, but I enjoyed the first two greatly. With Sam Raimi at the helm again, I expected nothing less than a good time. But this was really, really, really, really, I must reiterate another really, awful. The beginning was very promising, and then took about 90+ minutes to get somewhat exciting again. But even the end was numbed by the wretched romantic comedy that made up 3/4 of the film. It got to the point where I just wanted everyone to blow up without any closure whatsoever. Even the little things in this were bad. I know Stan Lee loves to make cameos in Marvel movies, but it was extremely forced and unnecessary in this one. Tobey Maguire is whinier than ever, save for a ""tough guy"" spurt halfway through that just does not work on so many levels. Apparently if a guy pastes his hair to his face and dance-walks around the streets, every attractive woman wants him. Kirsten Dunst looks asleep for most of the feature, but that's typical of her. If there was a show to be stolen, Thomas Hayden Church ran away with it. He did a good job, though I felt the character he portrayed didn't make much sense within the trilogy. The previous villains were masterminds gone wrong. The Sandman was just a criminal who got stuck in a pointless yet very convenient science experiment. Oh, and Venom showed up for about three minutes to bounce around a bit. All in all, this was really bad and a disgraceful follow-up to the previous two films. If there's anyone out there who hasn't seen it, spare yourself. Go to the video store, and rent Death To Smoochy. And that's that.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

REwatched on May 4th, 2024
Format: regular theatreSeeing this in theaters again brought back so many memories of when I first went to the theatre to watch it when I was 5 years old....and it proved how iconic and cool this trilogy really is.Despite how messy the storyline is, we can all agree that this film will forever remain a classic and that it was a great conclusion to Raimi's and Tobey's Spider-Man Trilogy. This trilogy became the perfect representation of how beautiful the 2000s were and what cinema and blockbuster really was all about during that period of time.Spider-Man 3 introduced 3 different villains and focused entirely on themes like friendships, relationships, heroism, and sacrificing. With all the chaos that was happening and the film trying to be so many things at the same time, it didn't disappoint in terms of presenting the ups and downs of the relationship between Parker and MJ, as well as the the friendship between Harry and Parker as it was building on the events of the previous 2 films in such a deep matter. Moreover, this part gave us the beautiful looking dark suite for the first time and presented Venom in the scariest and most serious way (comparing to Tom Hardy's comedic and UNserious Venom). Not to forget the plot-twisting and emotional backstory of Sandman that the film could've (and should've) touched on a little bit more in terms of his daughter and family, especially that it was left to be open ending.Christopher Young shines in this Part of the trilogy as a composer, in which he gave us the famous theme music of the Black suited 'Bully Maguire' Spider Man and was able to deliver the dark side of the character whenever the venom takes over. Moreover, the music that's playing in the background of each fight sequences sounded really different and unique in this part comparing to the previous two films. Not to forget the amazing work of Danny Elfman that inspired Christopher Young in this part as he built upon the work of Elfamn.Lastly, let's be honest and admit that this film has better CGI than half of MCU's current projects...and this film was released in 2007 by the way...","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The little black blob that is supposed to get on spider man and crap, that was supposed to come from a space ship that crashed, there's many other differences from the original story but hey would that really matter if they made it really good? Honestly i think way too much was shoved into one movie, 2 spider-mans worth in one, and venom's overall appearance was disappointing, he looked kinda gay quite frankly.The final battle wasn't exiting much at all, it was too straight forward and dumb.I just don't know, it was not as ""epic"" feeling as the first two, how number one touched you with its feeling of awesomeness, and Spiderman 2 was just so amazing, the action and all. Spider man 3 was too over done and I'm rather disappointed, and it really sucks that there may not be another one. I think the Spider-Man story could make 6 or 7 films if they wanted too.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"4","/10","My eyes hurt","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1690817/?ref_=tt_urv","Antagonisten","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0157498/?ref_=tt_urv","10 July 2007","I liked the first Spider-Man movie a lot. I liked the second somewhat less, but i still liked it a lot as well. Few movies have managed to capture the comic book-adventure feeling in quite the same way. The two first movies managed to be dramatic and funny at the same time, while still managing to get the best out of the comic.This however is something else completely. I wonder who at the studio made the decision to replace everything in the movie with a special effect? Where there used to be comedy, there are no special effects. Where there used to be action, there are now special effects. It's ridiculous to even call it special effects since there is probably hardly a single frame in this movie that is not edited with CGI. And trust me, i have nothing inherently against CGI, i only dislike it when it becomes a substitute for real film-making. And it does here.First of all a good villain is missing. A lot of the quality from the first two movies were Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina. Both were great villains in their own way, although Dafoe had more fun themes to work with. Here we have a man made of sand that makes you more sad than anything, and an ""evil"" Spider-man which definitely makes me sad. While Haden-Church does the best he can with Sandman, the character is just not a lot of fun. He's more the tragic kind of villain. He has my sympathies, but he won't carry the movie on his own. Topher Grace in the sort of villain/asshole part is also OK, but again he doesn't have a lot of fun material to work with.Besides missing a proper villain though, this movie has one major flaw and that is the effects. While they are probably technically very well done, they look expensive anyway, they are difficult to look at. At least for me it felt many times as though i was watching an animated roller-coaster. People were flying through the air, punching each other and my eyes started watering after a while. First of all, it's too exhausting to watch - especially for an effects-packed 140 minutes, and second it's not very well done despite the technical qualities. After all, i want to be able to see what's going on, now it was just things buzzing in front of my eyes. It hurt after about 80 minutes. After 140 minutes i was ready to throw away my lenses.The third point that bothered me was the running time. Like i said above, 140 minutes is steep for something this action- and effects-packed. And besides that the movie really doesn't have the script nor the story for this kind of marathon-like running time. I was desperately bored by the end of the movie, and felt for a while it was the worst thing i'd seen in the theater for a long time. Of course, it wasn't that bad, but painfully slow endings will destroy even the best movie experiences.In the end this isn't a disaster of an experience. I can't say i enjoyed this movie though. It was a mix between high expectations from the first two installments, and a general disappointment in the fact that an obviously huge budget has given such sloppy and hysterical special effects. I want more than this from Spider-Man. This just won't cut it. I rate it 4/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Now onto the good stuff, again the film is a visual feast, the scenes involving Sandman were spectacular and also the scene early on involving the crane.An appearance by Bruce Campbell is always a bonus, especially when his character is a snooty French restauranter.The action is fast and furious, yeas it does get a little bogged down with the amount of characters but this is two hours of fine pop-corn entertainment.8/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Too much, too contrived, but somehow still Spidey","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2117059/?ref_=tt_urv","refresh_daemon","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0812631/?ref_=tt_urv","25 August 2009","Spider-Man 3 is the first movie where Sam Raimi has disappointed me. It's certainly a Sam Raimi film and it very much follows the previous movies in terms of style, presentation and even in terms of where its story goes, but where it fails is to tell a well woven tale.The story follows after the events of Spider-Man 2 and both of the previous movies are briefly summarized visually during the opening credits, which is nice for those who have to catch up. Spider-Man has become the talk of the town and Mary Jane is opening up a show. Uh, then a whole ton of stuff happens in a hurry, including the introduction of three villains and a retcon of the first movie, which leads to a whole lot of emo-spidey/Peter Parker.And there's so much attempted in this story that it just doesn't hold together. Several elements of the stories feel heavily contrived, just to get all the villains present. The Harry Osborn, the the Black Suit and Eddie Brock have enough going for them that they could have all held together their own movies separately, using just the Sandman as an intermediary villain, but so little time is spent developing any of the major story lines that the film literally tells us what's going on most of the time and does things like retconning events of the first movie to fit in motive for the second emo-Parker. Which in itself is an inversion of the whole ""Raindrops Are Falling On My Head"" sequence from the second film. Unfortunately, the charm wore off and the sequence went on far too long this time around. Also, because the film has to juggle so many events, it felt like I was a ping pong ball bouncing back and forth between a heated game of ""let's change up the entire tone of the film with a dramatic twist"" over and over again. I really didn't appreciate that we hit emo-Spidey/Parker three entire times over the course of the film, with him ""getting better"" each time. The stories, the Mary Jane/Peter Parker story, the Harry Osborn story, the Eddie Brock/Black Suit story and the Sandman story all just aren't given enough time to breathe and set before things change over again.I got bored and I got frustrated. Furthermore, the Sandman, as a character is poorly developed and so are his powers, which ultimately seem overwhelming and it's surprising how easily he's defeated. The only character that gets some interesting development is Harry Osborn, but not enough time is spent with him and it doesn't feel like, at the end, what happens with him is earned by the film. So almost every element of the film seems a little forced.Technically, the film is up to the standards of the previous films. It looks great and Raimi and company maintains their eye for color, for camera-work, for adding cheese when wanted and providing kinetic action. The actors all remain up to the standards established by the previous films and I really do like how the film feels so much like the previous two in terms of the overall presentation.Ultimately, the only problem with Spider-Man 3 happens to be a huge one. The story essentially tries to sandwich what might be three movies worth of plot into a two hour movie (and yes, the movie really felt too long) and it just fails to pull me into its world, making me feel like I was getting smacked around by a giant plot stick. And it just seemed too obvious that it was trying to do that. And, so, I was quite disappointed by Spider-Man 3. It's not ""the suck"" entirely, because, contrived as it is, it still does try to tell a story (or two, or three) that might be coherent and meaningful if more time was given to it, but it doesn't succeed. I'd say it's fine to stop at Spider-Man 2 and leave the series on a good note. 5/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I enjoyed the first two films as everyone did, but I have never read a comic or touched a toy. But seriously, what's wrong with this movie? If you've been living under a rock, the geek-turned-superhero Spider Man is back for his third adventure. This time, he's not fighting one, but two - Sandman and Venom - villains whilst keeping his relationship with Mary Jane in tact. Harry Osborne is the ""new"" green goblin, revenging his fathers death. I saw Spider Man 3 on opening weekend - of course - and really enjoyed it. The action, characters, everything works fine.With the films length being the longest in the series yet, you would expect more action and more character development. When the action hits, it really hits. The technology is amazing & the sandman fights are stunning. But depending on what you prefer, the lack of action could be this films main flaw. The final 'battle' could have been longer and personally did not hit quite hit the nail on the head. The fights with Venom and Harry are, as always, well done and effective. All the special effects are just mind blowing, some of the best I have ever seen. You could sum the action and technology up in one sentence; Although it is rare in this third film, when our friend Spidey gets himself into trouble it is amazing to watch and the technology just gives it the kick it needs.The storyline and characters I found were not as good as the second film, but far better than the first. Thomas Haden Church plays a great Flint Marko/Sandman and the backing story for him is interesting to say the least. Topher Grace's character Eddie Brock/Venom brings in more depth and I believe has much less screen time. Both characters are enjoyable and both Thomas and Topher are satisfying as their villains. The one major flaw in this film for me is simple; I did not like Peter Parker. I just didn't. I thought the dark Spider Man was great but they ruined it with the so called 'emo' Peter Parker. That did not help my opinion on Peter either, but overall I just thought Tobey made Peter into a bit of an ass. Mary Jane was not one bit different, I could not see her character develop whatsoever. I found Harry to be the most interesting, and I despised Gwen Stacy. All characters in Spider Man 3 have their flaws and most have their moments but overall I thought the characters let this film down the most. The storyline was on par, nothing too great. It is of course hard to write a superhero movie with 3 villains and maintain relationships, have a job, and defeat them all - all within 150 minutes - without letting the quality of the script slip a little and have a few dull scenes etc etc. The acting was defiantly on par, I thought everyone did a great job. I must also note that the humorous scenes were indeed that - hilarious. Being a die hard horror fan I of course have seen - and own - the Evil Dead series and I was delighted to see Raimi gave Bruce Campbell another cameo. He was fantastic, I enjoyed his performance more than the second movies cameo. Although I did not like the 'emo' Peter Parker, I did enjoy bringing out the shooters and dancing down the street, it was hilarious.Spider Man 3 is NOT a masterpiece, but I do not understand why everyone is saying it's awful or it's boring. I enjoyed the film, yes there were flaws in it but every film has flaws - yes, even The Godfather.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Spider-Man 2 is one of my favourite films and is still my favourite superhero movie. Spider-Man 3 however is the black sheep of the Raimi trilogy.I have honestly been surprised by the hate this film got. It isn't just seen as the weakest one, people out there genuinely hate this film. As in I have seen this title on lists of worst comic book movies, and even just movies in general.This is all hyperbolic. While you can hate it (just like anyone can hate any film), it isn't bad on a technical level. It has some really excellent moments that still hold up. And it has more personality than most marvel films that followed.Sam Raimi was famously backed into a corner for this one. He had to include venom, he had to have 3 villains and he had to set up the next one. The poor guy was having to work triple time just to meet the shooting schedule. Afterwards, he too has expressed disappointment in the film. I think he is being a little too self-critical. It still feels like a Raimi movie. It looks great. The editing is top notch. The action is thrilling, with every punch hitting hard. And despite the films bloat, there is plenty of heart to its characters.The script really is where this film goes a bit off the track. It's already been said, but the story is overloaded. Not to mention strange decisions like the sudden change to Uncle Ben's story, the dance scene, and of course Emo Peter. This does mess the pacing, and means that certain characters are gone for long periods of time.But the focus is on Peter and MJ, and that is what holds the film together. It isn't the best on screen relationship by a long shot, but they are dealing with mature and relatable problems. It also means that, as bloated as it is, the story still flows well enough.All the actors do a good job. JK Simmons is the highlight of course. McGuire and Dunst are likeable as ever. Thomas Hayden Church is perfect as Sandman. Franco is meme-worthy in how hammy he is. The only case of miscasting is Topher Grace, who does well as Eddie Brock, but makes for a bad Venom.It is what it is. The bad scenes are pretty embarrassing and there are plenty of unintentionally hilarious moments. But there is an energy to it, as well as some masterful moments and thrilling action. It is worth a second look. For all its faults, I prefer it to all Spidy movie that came after it, except for Into the Spiderverse of course.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The director tried the tried, tested and abused route of intertwining a love story into action movie aka Titanic, and ended up sinking the ship of Spiderman.Probably, one more reason for sinking of Spiderman ship has to do with the pace of the movie. One gets the feeling that director was really in rush of getting Spiderman-3 released in the theatres. All the actions sequences were looking like being played in fast-forward, may be just to cover up, the similarlity to the action scenes in the predecessors.While the director speeds up the action sequences, he does'nt do any editing of the useless repeated melodromatic moments in the movie. Mary Jane keeps on struggling with her emotions throughout the movie, and for no apparent reason Peter Parker is not able to sense that.If the director really wanted to make an 2:30 hour epic, then he probably would have needed some more songs from Kirsten Dunst, or probably Shakira thrown in for an item number. Hollywood, can keep on critising Bollywood movies for their length, but I would still prefer a Bollywood masala movie with few item numbers throw in, rather than this 2:30 hour drag with Kirsten Dunst Opera !!!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There is solid entertainment in this flick and it stays pretty much on track compared to the previous releases. That is to say, it seems to evolve comfortably and you just want to be sure to sit through it without leaving.While I can agree that some of the characters could have used some more development, it's not enough that you cannot be comfortable with in what transpires during the movie. Also, the CGI is the best yet and the line between what is real and what isn't is getting very fine indeed. Peter's bar scene was great and Harry on that flying snowboard was nothing short of a scene steel.Great movie, I loved it and this is worth a trip to the theater. Spiderman is one of the most successful Marvel movie developments and I hope it doesn't end to soon! GO SEE IT!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It seemed like to much comedy was trying to be put into the movie. Peters ""Bad antics"" were shown as childish, and he didn't seem as much as a bad ass as he should've been. Ex: Dancing like a douche on the street, not paying attention to Dr. Connors while eating cookies. In some actions scenes people weren't soo into it, they were to calm and not as dramatic as they used to be in Spider-man 1-2. The part of Eddie Brock should not have been given to Topher Grace. Ii anything he'd make a better Spider-Man what with the rise cracks and cool moves. But Eddie Brock is a football player, an not a teenager. He's a big character in the comics and isn't shown as much as he should've been. Venom was not what i expected, he was spider-man's size, and wasn't as strong as he is. Another big character, Gwen Stacey, is also a big character shown in few scenes. She was also peter's love interest at one point but lack of drama put into the movie didn't show that. Spider-Man 3 = Fail. Hopefully the next movie will be better.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Getting us to sympathize with characters by making us live their stupidity and usually absurdly uncomfortable moments rarely works in movies. Especially if they are as 1-dimensional as a piece of string.Mind you, ""EMO Spidey"" is sort of appropriate in todays world.Cameo appearances by Topher Grace did breathe some life into this rotting corpse of a movie, and Bruce Campbell can do no wrong either.So, if your obsessed with the series, or live in a fruity fantasy world, maybe you'll get a kick out of this movie in any place other than the groin.

It was not good, and most certainly not great. It was melodramatic, and there were more miscasts than cats at an evil spinsters' home. James Cromwell's talent (which there isn't much of) is wasted in this. Topher Grace, who is great (well, good) in That Seventies Show is terrible in this. I didn't buy him for one second as the big burly bad guy. Speaking of big and burly, we find ourselves wondering why Thomas Haden Church (Academy Award nominee for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Sideways) is in this poor excuse for a film. And why put a villain as week as the Sandman in the last (hopefully) Spiderman. If you were going to put in a villain, why not put in Kingpin, or some other significant bad guy. I just didn't like it. I don't think that Tobey Maguire is a good actor in the least, and I think he should not 'grace' us in any other movies. Don't go and expect to see a great film, or even a good one. Go just to see action and visual effects, which are quite exceptional, but that's the only thing exceptional about it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I have to admit when I first saw this film upon its release I absolutely despised it. I thought it was just a dumpster fire, and it was a pleasant surprise to see that it wasn't quite as horrible as I remember it being, even if it still wasn't very good. There are simply too many plotlines and characters for this film to bare, and it feels so convoluted with so much exposition and so little actually happening on screen, it can truly feel like a bore at times. The acting also is...well lets just say not very good, especially with Topher Grace taking on the character of Eddie Brock aka Venom (mistcasting alert) and Maguire's overdone emotional performances and crying sequences throughout. The film does have its charms from time to time though, I can't say I remember everything that goes on or why, but it can be oddly charming at times- even if it is quite random. The black suit spider-man is a very well done costume and I also enjoyed the look of Thomas Haden Church Sandman character throughout- even if his performance itself was rather subpar. Most of the action scenes are very well choreographed and the film does have quite a bit of heart to it at times, even if it does seem to be going in circles. In the end, Spider-Man 3 can be boring, overdone, and misguided at times- another example of what happens with studio interference with a blockbuster- but it hardly deserves the amount of hate it receives and can at times be a mildly enjoyable if campy little superhero flick. I'd never watch it again by choice, but honestly speaking it still beats out Marvel Eternals for me.My Rating: 5/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The movie is basically high school level drama on screen and then Spider Man cries. Other than that it creates the dumbest storyline in a comic movie ever (The whole Sandman story is insulting and annoying)and completely squanders a possibly entertaining one(Venom).This movie isn't even so bad that it's funny because its such a disappointment and boring.James Franco acts like he needs special assistance for half the movie because of some lame short term memory loss. MJ sucks at singing and gets fired and then she bores the audience with her jealously and hypocrisy.Peter Parker joins the emo scene and acts like the lead singer from Fall Out Boy. Gwen Stacy is cute and not annoying and thus gets limited screen time while they discard a charismatic performance from Topher Grace because Venom is too mean for Sam Ramai. The rest of the movie just stumbles along until to its end and Spider Man is allowed to cry again. At least Dark Knight is coming soon. This movie sucks.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Kirsten Dunst, despite being a decent looking gal, fails to entertain. Her portrayal of Mary Jane as a Flakey sap attempting Broadway stardom fails to gain sympathy, and further frustrates you at Spiderman. A massively condensed plot line encompassing the Blacksuited spidey into about maybe 45 minutes of screen time and, to my personal dismay Venom has what I would guess is about 15. The movie slowly trudges along making you feel like your sailing down a river of molasses, in the middle of January, hoping and praying every second of the way for the end credits to role. All the while wishing that the action scenes would start. Which are few and far between.

It has NO respect for the memory of Gwendolyn Stacy (who is played fantastically, she, Eddie Brock and Sandman each get a point, totaling the movie at 3 out of 10), who's story is in the first movie. M.J. (Kirsten Dunst) needs acting lessons and why oh why is there jazz in the movie? MJ is not a singer. She is an actor/ model. I liked Eddie Brock, he (Topher Grace) would have been my choice of Peter Parker. Maguire just does not have the Peter Parker vibe, he is portraying him as a loser, while Parker, not Spidey, is the real hero. It is all about how he handles his life, cursing the great responsibility that his great power brought him. This movie does not reflect that at all. It is all about how many bits they can put in there, not minding the rich Spider-man tradition. I mean: doesn't Harry get to marry and have a son??? It really limits the future of any Spider-man movie. I really hated this movie, which is too long, although I love spider-man. But you cannot treat Gwen this way, she is the original sweetheart. After the spider-bite and the death of uncle Ben Gwendolyn's murder by the Green Goblin is the most important factor that shapes Spider-man (you will remember that this scene was violated in Spider-man 1) Thomas Church is brilliant and shows the only aspect of the comic still surviving: villains are not naturally evil, they just turn out that way at a certain moment. But why the creators thought it was a great idea to connect everyone so closely to Peter Parker is beyond me. And why is Gwendolyn a science student? Ah well, she looked great and acted (along with Thomas Church, Topher Grace and in the first 3/4 James Franco). I can only say: I am actually hurt by this movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

We get a Venom who refers to himself as ""I"" instead of ""we"". Venom doesn't say ""I"" or ""my"", Venom is a character comprised of two personalities and always said ""we"". We have a ""new"" goblin. Harry didn't take up the role of Green Goblin 2, Hobgoblin or any other goblin. Harry became a flying snowboard riding weenie who cried more than he fought and went from murderous Spiderman destroying psychopath to ""Pete's my friend again"" in the blink of an eye. As frustrating as all that is we get stuck in this movie watching the Parker, Osborn, Watson triangle of love for the second time?! What's wrong Mr. Raimi couldn't you come up with some fresh ideas for this script. I won't even comment on Emo Peter and his stint as a wannabe Jim Carry from The Mask. All in all this movie was hyped up to be the best movie of the year and it'll be lucky to land number 7 on that list. Not very impressive and will be glad to see it go.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"9","/10","So much better than 2!!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1651433/?ref_=tt_urv","gdeangel","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0941769/?ref_=tt_urv","7 May 2007","If you want to know how to doom a Marvel franchise to three with smashing success at the box-office, watch X-3. If you want to know how to come back from a big-turn out, too much sappy music, too much Hamelet-esquire pontificating on love and identity, too much screen time given to Gee-Wiz comic-science, and not enough bad-guy action, and hit a home run, Spiderman 3 is the answer.The movie was genuinely fresh. The bad guys were complex and yet simple, in a way that made the poignant image of a number tattooed on Magnetos arm look flat. And the special effects were extraordinary. I'm not just talking about eye candy that shows up in every sci-fi movie and TV show now. There is a rapid decent free fall with full on fist fighting so complex and realistic, I can only imagine what it looked like in I-Max. The sandman special effects during the armored car fight were extraordinary. The funny business of strutting down the sidewalk in New York, or the enthusiastic french waiter were all employed to add some levity to what otherwise typically ends up a formulaic super-hero exercise of (1) Tell Good Guy's Story/Make him good (2) Introduce Bad Guy/make him bad (3) Make them Fight.Part of this film was shot in Cleveland, but the visuals from New York were extrodinarily well placed ... and I don't mean an obligatory shot of the Chrysler building or the Empire State. There are shots of the top of the AT&T building casually woven into the background. There is the partial destruction of the Fisher building by a crane. Probably only New Yorkers and architectural fans will get these images, but it shows great attention to detail.One criticism: it runs a little long. Cut action, and it would have dragged like Spidey 2. Cut the interludes with the singing and dancing, and it would have failed to impress on the order of X3. The one thing that could have been cut were the sappy scenes with Aunt Mae. Her presaging the difficulty between Peter and MJ, was completely unnecessary - it's a story that can tell itself.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Well, it's like this: in the original ""The Nutty Professor,"" Jerry Lewis plays a nerd scientist who invents a Jekyll/Hyde formula that turns him into a suave, sophisticated, irresistible, arrogant ladies man who calls himself ""Buddy Love."" In this movie, Peter Parker comes under the influence of some type of alien life-form that turns him into a suave, sophisticated, irresistible, arrogant lades man who calls himself--well, he still calls himself Peter Parker. Not that being influenced by Mr. Lewis' film is bad; actually it's a pretty humorous part of the movie.Other highlights: 1. Bruce Campbell should be the next Inspector Jacques Clouseau. Take a look at his supporting performance and see if you don't agree that he has that Clouseau thing down pat. In fact, it wouldn't be a surprise to learn that he was purposely imitating the great detective.2. The score was exceptional. It reminded me of the kinds of scores you might find in movies of the 30's and 40's.3. Kirsten Dunst sings Irving Berlin, and you can't beat Irving Berlin. I thought she was going to sing Peggy Lee's ""Fever"" (the introduction to the song is played in the nightclub scene), but she didn't. And Chubby Checkers sings ""The Twist."" In fact, this movie, to me, hearkened back to great action films of yesterday. It has the feel of a 1940's serial, with one action scene built upon another. Truthfully, expect for some minor cussing and maybe one violent part, this movie would fit perfectly into that time period.I have only three negative criticisms: one, it's too long. I enjoyed it once, but I wouldn't want to sit through it again in the near future, unless, maybe, I wanted to visit an IMAX theater. Second, too much of it is obviously a cartoon. It looks like the computer generated images it is. Third, as in all action movies today, the film is populated with action shots made of closeups and herky-jerky motions so that the viewer really can't see the action the filmmaker is supposed to showing him.So, great move; just a little too long.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Spider-Man (Tobey Mcguire) seems to have a sweet life as Spidy whom is New York's number one celebrity and hero, he wants to ask Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). However things get out of hand, a criminal named Marko Flint (Thomas Hayden Church) escapes from prison as he accidentally finds himself as he was the true killer of Uncle Ben in a testing range where he accidentally finds himself in the middle of a experiment involving radioactive sand that makes him into The Sandman. Peter's best friend Harry (James Franco) becomes New Goblin to get revenge for what Peter did to his father only to get himself in the hospital, later a weird black alien goo from another world lands on Earth to attach itself to Spider-Man's costume making it all dark with more advanced powers. It somehow changes his personality and he has been having an affair with beautiful Gwen Stacy (Bryce Dallas Howard) making MJ jealous, not only that but new photographer Eddie Brock (Topher Grace) becomes Parker's rival. Later as Peter rejects the costume, it absorbs Brock turning him into a sharp-toothed grinning Bizarro version of Spider-Man called Venom whom join forces with Sandman on a diabolical scheme that only Spider-Man can stop.A very weak but entertaining entry of the popular superhero franchise! nowhere as good as the first or as great as the second, this does have good and bad points. The bad points for example is the goofy dance sequence where Parker acts like Jim Carrey's The Mask, three villains instead of 2 or 1, and a complex storyline that can go over the audience's heads. The Villains were not deep or hard enough like the first two movies where they were actually developed, but there's good points like some of the returning cast like JK Simmons with Rosemarry Harris back with appearances by Bruce Campbell, Stan Lee, William Defoe, and Ted Raimi. It does have Sam Raimi's trademark direction with stunning special effects even with Venom and good action sequences.Yes it is the weakest of the series but does have good entertainment, i hope the fourth one coming out in 2011 will improve on this one.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Astounding fight scenes, realistic CGI effects, and drama (which was sometimes off). I'll admit: #3 was'nt a perfect movie. Now don't get me wrong it was one heck of a Summer movie, but there were a few details that held it back from getting a 10. First off, the positives: 1: Superb fight scenes. Sam definitely did his best in this area.2: Amazing CGI. Sandman's CGI effects were the most brilliant I've ever seen.3: Humor. Since when does Jameson never make you laugh. Bruce Campbell's scene was pretty hilarious too.Now (drum roll), the negatives: 1: Acting. Most of the acting was good, but some of it was absolutely sloppy. Come on now Tobey that was the worst crying impression on the bridge i ever heard!!! 2: Useless villain. And I'm talking about Venom. yes, he's a good and powerful character to put in a Spiderman movie, but he was just added a little too early in the franchise. It would of been a lot better if he was in a future installment.3: Fast-pacing. This movie would have been a lot better if it reached the 3 hour marker. That way Raimi could do everything right. The scene where Eddie turns into Venom and 5-10 minutes later Spiderman fights him at the construction site was going a little too fast in storytelling. Sam should have focused on one or two villains, not three, because you're sort of ruining the focus of of every story line in the movie. Now if this movie was three hours long, the pacing MIGHT be a little better.Overall, this movie was still an amazing spectacle to watch. I just hope future installments don't fall because of the same things.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Plenty of action, fights, and special effects. Everything you want from a summer movie.I felt that the only flaws were the corny moments. I, like everyone else I think, could have done without out Peter's little dance number. The British news reporter seemed a little out of place in NYC, and she really hammed it to try to add some drama. It got a little ""cartoonish"" near the end when every body clapped and jumped up and down when Spidey showed up to save the day, but I kind of expected it from Sam Raimi.Overall, this was a fun movie to go see in the theater. They did cram a lot in to two an half hours, but you don't feel disappointed at the end. Don't let all of the crying fanboys bashing the movie scare you away if you are on the bubble about seeing it.

After reading the negative comments I was disappointed the movie didn't deliver for everybody. I agree with the fact that they were trying to put way too many elements in the movie, this required you to keep constant attention and be able to grow quickly with the storyline. By knowing the previous installments this could be easily maintained since you are more aware of the style of directing. I also liked the fact that Raimi included the slow romantic moments to let you analyse what just happened, while still enjoying the scene.Future movies will only be faster and will include more stuff since evolution in film is inevitable. That makes me wonder how many things they will include within 2 hours of film by the time I am 50 years old :P.I definitely believe the director did an excellent job on SM3. It just wasn't well interpeted by his audience. It also had to life up to his predecessors which created way too much hype.9/10 excellent!!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Spider-Man seems more developed as a character, with more interesting flaws, as well as some great webspinning acrobatics and the best villains so far. It really reminded me of the comic books, and made me think that many complaints about this movie are actually complaints about the way comic book plots develop. For anyone familiar with Spidey, this movie is like those issues that would occasionally come out with three different villains on the cover and ""Introducing... the Sandman, plus Venom and The Green Goblin!!!"" or something like that running along one side. It's got tons of action and the pace may come at the cost of character development, but it's a comic book movie and a good one!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's just not as funny as the first, but I liked the story lines. The movie had several so it kept you entertained. As expected, the special effects were great in this. Sandman may not have been visually as striking as Doc Oc but it was very well done. I liked it when he would just melt into sand. Jealously plays a big role in the story line. MJ is jealous of Gwen Stacy, a girl in Pete's science class, who gives a key to the city to Spiderman as well as a kiss. MJ gets back at Pete by hanging out with Harry more. And Gwen's ex, Eddie Brock, is jealous of her hanging out with Pete.There are 3 villains. Harry is the Green Goblin again and is out for revenge. He doesn't care that Pete is Spiderman. There is neat fight between him and Spiderman and he loses his memory for part of the film, so he and Pete become friends again.The Sandman is an escaped convict whom turns out to be the man who really shot Ben. So, of course Pete wants to hunt him down. Several great fights with Sandman. And then Eddie Brock turns into Venom by getting some of the black alien sludge on him. The sludge is like a parasite that takes over the host and influences aggression. It tries to do the same to Spiderman but on a smaller scale. Venom is cool and should have been in the film earlier.The way they get rid of Sandman was a little silly. Is he really gone, he could come back in a future sequel.FINAL VERDICT: Great superhero movie even if not the best in this franchise. It was still a lot better than Iron man, the superhero hit from the first part of 2008. Definitely a must see.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie was great! Tobey Maguire scores another hit in the movie saga of Marvel's Wall-Crawling Top Dude. Kirsten Dunst remains hot as Mary Jane Watson, and J.K. Simmons is even better than ever as J. Jonah Jameson, only more meaner and hot-tempered since part 2. The villains were Sandman (Thomas Haden Church), Venom (Topher Grace), and New Goblin (James Franco), also known as Peter Parker's best friend Harry Osborn, whose dad was Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) in part 1. I don't see what all the big bad complaining's about, I loved this one, not as much as I loved part 2, yet Spider-Man's still got it in him to be the hero to save the day. However, in this one, he shows a dark side to his personality that reminded me of the dark side of Superman in 1983's ""Superman III"". And like all other heroes, he must get this dark side out of the way if he wants to be loved and respected by the people again. Redemption is the name of the game here. I might sound a bit preachy here, but two themes are also shown in a Biblical way in the movie: Sacrifice And Forgiveness. I refuse to say how or when it occurs, but it's there. Look for it! Altogether, ""Spider-Man 3"" was great, and if for some reason the cast and crew decide to ""Spider-Man 4"", I'll be along for one more spin, because nobody plays Spidey better than Tobey Maguire.

For all those not too interested in the spider man tales or into movies it was overall amazing. The effects were amazing the fight with sand man was awesome! but there was just so much lacking to it. When i first saw Gwen Stacy i was shocked to think they were going to fight her story in as well as Sandman and Venom. But no they just added her character totally out of context. Why was she in there? where was the story? her fathers death? her love for peter but hatred of spider man? her death caused by spider man :S ? none of it was there it was like they just wanted to add another face. the Sandman story was near nuff perfect and well done. Venom was done not bad but i thot spider man got the suit from space but I'm not to sure. I didn't think he was that impressive tho, at the end wen spidy kills him was good but throughout he was just too small.The whole bad peter thing i dunno if i agree it was done well. The whole supposable emo thing just didn't work. The scene in the club where Mj works made me wanna stand up and leave.But i have to say i did enjoy the movie once i got passed all the mumf and ill definitely be buying it but it definitely wasn't my favourite spidy film, it felt like they just wanted to get it over with as quickly as the could and bunched a bunch of snip its togetherbut u gotta love the spidy!oh one thing i found hilarious when i went to see it. two men behind me were talking bout how spider man was missing something all great superheros had such as batman and superman ( however in my mind batman ain't a superhero) anyway they were complain spider man had no theme tune and that he couldn't b a real hero till he did. now i may be wrong but I'm sure he doesspider man spider man does whatever a spider can spins a web any size catches thieves just ike flies look out here comes spider manye thats all i know lol","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

(slight spoilers)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1652981/?ref_=tt_urv","wsheit","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3766810/?ref_=tt_urv","9 May 2007","So Spiderman 3 has broken all of the records Pirates of the Caribbean 2 set last year. Is it a worthy successor? Yes and no: It's no secret that I'm not a fan of Sam Raimi's take on Spiderman. The biggest problem I see here is casting: Tobey Maguire is too soft- even for Peter Parker. I would have cast Jake Gyllenhal or someone of that ilk in the role. Parker is supposed to be vulnerable to some degree, but he also has the confidence to throw quips in addition to webs at villains as he battles them. I've also been disappointed with some rather problematic departures from the comic. Since when has Doctor Octopus been anything but a sociopath? Since when are Spiderman's webshooters a part of his mutation? These may seem insignificant, but as someone who grew up with Spiderman, they introduce issues of believability.When I heard that Topher Grace had been cast as Venom (?), I prepared for the worst.It would appear that the third time is the charm, as Raimi and co. managed to do far better than the worst. In fact, Spiderman 3 is a great action movie marred only by some more frustrating departures from the comics. Let's start with the problems: 1. Gwen Stacy- In the comics, Stacy is a girl Peter dates before MJ. The Green Goblin kills her. That's her significance...she dies. Since the Green Goblin isn't in the film, you know from day one that this, at least, can't happen. So why was she thrown into the film? While Howard is beautiful as Gwen, using the name Gwen Stacy was a poor choice.2. Slight Spoilers here- once Peter gets the suit, he goes on an ego boost. There's about a minute of film where he's dancing on the street...in terribly flamboyant fashion. I'm not sure if I was supposed to be laughing, but I was. It seemed out of place. Also, during the costume phase, the director decided to change Peter's hair and dye it black. He ends up looking textbook emo...it REALLY doesn't work.3. Topher Grace managed to pull off Venom, but I can't shake the feeling that someone with a larger build should have filled the role.4. There's a tad of artificial plotting; in several cases, the characters display losses of reason that stretch the bounds of credibility- particularly Mary Jane.BUT the good far outweighs the bad...Action: FINALLY, someone tapped into the truly fluid movement Spiderman should be capable of. The fighting choreography is truly imaginative and some of the best I've ever seen. The action scenes are so fast that I'll need a second viewing to understand every twist and turn, but I love that they trust the audience to unwind them. Plus, the level of suspense they create is tangible. I will say, though, that the first real action scene turns out to be the best.Score: Elfman turns out some really memorable cues here. All of the old themes are back, but the new ones for Sandman, especially, help audiences to really feel Sandman's subplot.Plotting: While I've mentioned a few problems above, I have to admit that the movie largely drew me in. As I so rarely do, I realized halfway through the movie that I was having fun and didn't want it to end. The story is engaging, and Maguire does come across a bit less whiney than he did in past iterations. Some critics have argued that tossing in so many villains made the film less cohesive, but they must have watched a different movie. Raimi uses each of the villains at different points to develop the couple of themes he promotes. It all comes together rather nicely at the end, though I will say that I found the FINAL scene just a tad too short.Even with it's problems, Spiderman 3 still ranks as one of the best superhero movies ever made. While it isn't as good as Batman Begins or Blade 2, it's easily as good as the best of the X-men franchise. So, for the first time with the Spiderman films, I'm really hoping for a sequel.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

And for once I succeeded. The show started at 12:01 AM on the day of release, so I was pretty much seeing it as soon as humanly possible.With popcorn and drinks at the ready in a theatre full of the usual trouble making delinquents (although they didn't really bother me on this occasion), I had a slight sensation of nervous anticipation, like any good fanboy would. The film starts, and my anticipation eases as the 140 minute visual feast unfolds in typically unabashed ""prepare for the ride"" style.It starts off, and all is peachy for Peter Parkerhe's found stability in his life, and able to balance the pressures of being a superhero with trying to live a normal life. More importantly, however, he is in love with the girl of his dreams, the omnipresent MJ Watson, played by the delightful Kirsten Dunst. Soon we learn that Peter is so in love that he's going to proposecue emotional scene with Aunt May about how much he loves MJ and all seems to be going rather smoothly. However, we all know there is no such thing as a happy ending.Over the next 2 and a bit hours, we, the audience are subjected to pretty much everything. We have action sequences galore with enough CGI to make you choke on your Haribo, three very different and menacing villains, two love interests and an internal struggle in the psyche of Peter Parker. One wonders if Sam Raimi merely forgot to add the partridge in a pear tree because he was too busy orchestrating this cinematic chaos.It is a gloriously ambitious film, maybe a little too much so. With so many plot threads dangling up in the air, at times you want to give the film a good hard slap, so as to give it some semblance of order. There are instances of scenes placed next to one another that seem like they shouldn't be thereemotionally they don't carry. However, this doesn't mean that the plots in this film are bad. Aside from the well publicised ""enemy within"" that Peter Parker faces, there is also the matter of dealing with a best-friend-turned-evil-son-of-a-gun Harry/Green Goblin 2, who is hellbent on revenge, the newly revealed killer of Peter's uncle from the first film  Flint Marko/Sandman and the cocky photographer Eddie Brock who would later become Venom. There's a lot of stuff to deal with, and this is where the film falls down. The film is an engaging one, and never do you lose interest, but it is the cinematic equivalent of having a three course meal followed by a pint of Guinness and a Chocolate Forest Gateau, it just feels bloated.However, there are many good points about this film. It is surprisingly very funny. At times I had to ask myself, am I watching a summer action blockbuster or a romantic comedy? I suppose with Sam Raimi's character focused ethos, it affords him the opportunity of showing all sides of their personalities, not just those relevant to the plot. With this in mind, the scene with the new ""cocky"" Peter walking/dancing down the street is a very amusing one.The action is superb, but crucially, not groundbreaking. There are many fights between Spiderman and his nemeses, but none them make you sit up and think ""Wow, this is amazing!"". I was particularly disappointed with the final confrontation between Spiderman and the villains, because it just felt like we had seen it all before, and didn't come close to touching the climactic ""Train Battle"" sequence of Spiderman 2.I also would have like to have seen Topher Grace given more room to spread his wings, because whenever he is on screen, as Eddie Brock at least, he is captivating. The same can be said for the 40s-esque editor of the Daily Bugle J. Jonah Jameson, who defines the term ""scene-stealer"". But hey, it's all well and good for me to tell Sam Raimi where he went wrong, but he and the rest of the people who put this film together must be applauded for creating a piece of such magnitude, even if it is flawed.So, overall, how is it? It's good, really good, but doesn't compare to Spiderman 2, I'm sorry to say. If this is the last of the films in the franchise, then it is a fitting end as all the loose ends are tied up, and is suitably emotionally weighted. However, if this does stay as a trilogy, then it only goes to prove, like the Godfather and Star Wars (originals) before it, that the second part is always the best.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Sam Raimi) Life finally feels good for Peter Parker. He has managed to balance life as both Spider-Man and as Mary Jane's boyfriend. He is even planning on proposing to MJ. But life isn't always going to be easy for the webbed hero. Harry Osborn still hasn't forgiven Peter for the death of his father. He has developed the perfect technology and crowns himself the 'New Goblin'. Harry isn't the only problem. It is revealed that an escaped convict, Flint Marko is the real killer of Peter's uncle. After an accident, he is now the invincible 'Sandman', who has teamed up with Venom to target the superhero, who is struggling to handle his life.'Spider-Man' was introduced in 2002 and was an instant success. 'Spider-Man 2' was released two years later and was even better. The third movie of the series isn't as great as the second film, but is still a great film to watch. The main problem is does has is the amount of story they are trying to give. It's great with so many new and interesting characters, but there is just a lot to fit into a 2 hour film. The great special effects are back, with amazing shots of Sandman and Venom. Thomas Hayden Church and Topher Grace are amazing as villains. There are some fun highlights during the story, but also some cringe worthy moments, such as an emo style Peter Parker dancing through the film. Still it is a great part of a great trilogy (so far). If you've never seen this superhero in action, you really need to watch this trilogy, even if your not a comic book fan.""Woah...Spidey.

After I saw the third installment, a friend of mine told me that a Spider-Man 4, 5, and 6 were being planned. And then I realized...this series is only getting dragged out for money. The story took a backseat.Spider-Man 3 is a fairly good movie, don't get me wrong, but there is nothing new or ridiculously exciting here. I feel like I've seen all of the dude's moves and I've seen the action sequences before. The cinematography is good but not any different than the other movies and none of the scenes really jumped out. It just didn't cut it for me.Anyways, Peter Parker is back as Spider-Man, and we see that his life is back on track. He's in school, he saves people, and he's dating that ""what's her name"" chick. Life is good. But a movie would suck if nothing happens, so sh*t happens here. Now we have three bad guys going after him: Harry Osbourne as the Goblin dude, the Sandman, and Venom. You would think that all these villains makes the movie more interesting, but all it does is make it into a bigger mess. Too many plots are going on and the movie is just too long. It's funny because during the movie (about 2 hours in), I'm thinking ""God, wrap it up already!"" When I went to Grindhouse and it finished (after about 3 hrs. 40 minutes), I'm thinking ""God, why wasn't it longer?"" Spider-Man 3 just didn't hold my full interest.Plot aside, the action sequences are very good. Some of them look like graphics from a video game, and some look fantastic. They are exciting but like I said before, nothing really different when being compared to the other Spider-Man movies. One thing that I really hated about this movie was the cheesy dialogue. I mean, some scenes were very bad. You had to go to ""The School of Screenwriters and Cheese"" to write some of these lines. But that's the thing with most superhero movies, so just enjoy it for what it is.In my opinion, I really think Spider-Man 2 was a better movie. It was more organized and more interesting. Nevertheless, this movie will not disappoint fans of the series and it definitely won't disappoint at the box office. I recommend this movie and I also recommend showing up early (it will be PACKED....GUARANTEED).7.5 out of 10 (I put 8 because I felt generous and rounded up).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Breathtaking, to say the least. Any movie with actions scenes that get my heart racing and my girlfriend's palm sweaty gets a massive seal of approval and the movie does indeed have far more action than its prequels.The plot itself is complex but very coherent and engaging. Once again, the entire cast has delivered a tremendous performance. Every character is believable to a tee which is always important for a fantasy movie like Spider-Man. Peter Parker's inner turmoil and transformation ranges from entertaining to disturbing - it is this 'face your demons' theme that holds the film together well.On to my gripes. Since this is the third and apparently last Spider-Man film, I was hoping for an ending with a bit more finality. The final confrontation is tense and visually astounding, but also quite erratic because of all the characters involved. In addition, I feel there was a missed opportunity regarding the lack of an epic one-on-one between Spidey and Venom.Certain issues that were brought up in the movie are not addressed in the end and lot is left hanging, which is why I believe another Spidey movie is on the cards. I would be quite surprised if there weren't because the final scene especially offers very little closure, considering.All in all this is a fantastic film. The only thing that really bugged me was the lack of closure, especially since this is supposed to be the last Spidey in the series. Apart from that, director Sam Raimi has once again told a powerful story full of emotion, excitement, danger and darkness that should not be missed by any movie lover anywhere. I'll not be totally satisfied, however, until I get that closing finale that I've been waiting for. Roll on Spidey 4!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first instalment was great, the second was even better. This third movie is the best of them all. Blockbusters nowadays often turn out to be huge letdowns. You get a flashy trailer with all the best bits and basically that pretty much is the whole film. Spider-man 3 has it all action, thriller, romance, comedy, drama. This is certainly a bit darker than the other movies but it has some light moments. There's a great cameo by Bruce Campbell and J K Simmons chips in with his magnificent portrayal of editor J Jonah Jameson. You wouldn't be wrong in assuming that he was born to play the role. The story moves at an electrifying pace and the massive runtime seems to just whiz by with hardly a dull moment. Hardcore spidey fans are complaining that venom hardly got any screen time and it is true as Topher Grace has only about 3 or 4 scenes in the movie but thats what the producers wanted. Venoms story is not told in as much detail as fans would have liked but incorporating that would increase the runtime by at least another hour, which for a blockbuster would be quite ludicrous. Everything has been packed into the 2 hours 15mins or whatever it is but everything works really well when you consider that spider-man is Peter Parker's story. The whole movie is about him and his trials and tribulations in becoming the greatest superhero ever. The movie has good moral values and messages but other than that, you can switch your brain off, sit back and enjoy this blockbusting experience.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I enjoyed it.Perhaps the main flaw in Spidey 3 is the flow of plots. In my opinion the first two films had all of their story lines flow very nicely. Spiderman 3 seems to have a few too many of these story lines, and was not able to make them flow as smoothly. Let's count the story lines just to show how many there are.1. Story of Peter Parker and getting revenge for his uncle. 2. Story of Flint Marko/Sandman 3. Story of Eddie Brock 4. Story of Mary Jane 5. Story of Harry Osbourne Those are the 5 main, huge story lines in Spiderman 3. Kind of shaky.Perhaps another flaw was the acting by Tobey Maguire.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The John Travolta tribute seemed a little dated, though. Zena's writer and creator has come a long way from the Evil Dead series. His cut on Raimi style movie making hits home with a formula of pleasing Hollywood and satiating the appetite of comic readers at the same time. The trilogy of villains seem to indicate the pulling out of all stops to make the movie jump off the screen. I even like the way he finds characters for his first hit maker, Bruce Campbell. The way he cuts straight to business by showing the the heart of each character is interesting but also a bit disappointing to the true comic readers. Still, it brings the expedience of movie making to light and allows any viewer to accept them without reading the backgrounds from the Marvel comics.

I just came back from seeing Spiderman 3 in a big cinema and everyone laughed, there was some cheering, and even clapping at the end.It is true that the film has a slightly messy feel about it, for example with characters like the butler or Sandman seemingly saying things 'just when needed' to move the plot along in a slightly unconvincing way. But many things that other people here cite as weakenesses of the movie seem to me to be actual strengths, for example how you lose sympathy for Peter Parker in the first half of the film because he lacks empathy for Mary Jane - something that I thought was a bold move by the writers that effectively raised the emotional stakes of the last half of the movie.I really get a strong feeling that people writing bad reviews are being affected by their own expectations too much. Taken on its own merits, this was an intense, funny, happy and satisfyingly oddball movie.And yes, Bruce Cambell's ""I am a French man"" (delivered in entirely unconvincing accent) and short goofy performance was a gem. Bruce once tried to get the role of The Flash (but was pipped to the post), and appeared in Darkman too, so it's high time he got his own superhero role!

It makes a very great point about things not always being as they seem. And that it's not as simple as good vs evil. We all have good and evil within us.I would in fact argue that the second film is the worst of the three. It is basically exactly the same as the first one just with a different villain.Green goblin absolutely carries the first one as willem dafoe is an absolutely phenomenal actor.But guys let's be real. This is a really good movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Harry Osborn still seeks vengeance for his father's death, and an escaped Flint Marko falls into a particle accelerator and is transformed into a shape-shifting sand manipulator. An extraterrestrial symbiote crashing to Earth and bonds with Peter, influencing his behavior for the worse. When Peter abandons the symbiote, it finds refuge in Eddie Brock, a rival photographer, Eddie Brick, causing Peter to face his greatest challenge.This movie had me feeling some cool amazing emotions. The main criticism to me is Venom, because he was the biggest character promoted in the trailers and posters to the film and he only got ten minutes of screen time, now, if they would have made this three hours long, this film would have been fine.The music by Christopher Young is amazing and Danny Elfman's themes from the first two SPIDER-MAN films and it is amazing. The story of Sandman is just emotionally powerful and Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko / Sandman is emotionally powerful in his performance. The story of the symbiote was confusing as heck, but when Eddie turned into Venom, that confusion all went away.The visual effects and action sequences are just amazing in this film, but I hate the fight between Harry and Peter because they are supposed to be friends, but they are not, until at the end of the damn movie. What the freak happened man?The acting survives. Tobey Maguire and the returning cast all do really great jobs this time around. Topher Grace as Venom / Eddie Brock, I don't hate him, I just wish his character was developed a little bit more. Bryce Dallas Howard as Gwen Stacy, she is okay, but Emma Stone's version of the character is just amazing and it is really cool.Overall, SPIDER-MAN 3 does a few things right, but with some major issues and like I said, if the film was three to four hours long, it would have been fine. I'm giving a 7/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Of course this movie has flaws but overall it delivers on many fronts! Everything looks great. Spiderman and the villains all look very real. This third part contains even more action than the previous movies! The green goblin, the sandman, the symbiont (the alien black stuff) and last but not least Venom make an appearance in this third part.(Although he doesn't appear as long as I wanted to. Also Venom spoke in the I form and not using the first person plural case (we) like he did in the comics! A minor flaw. But could have made a huge difference.) At first it seems that Sam Raimi wanted to do much. But if i think about it isn't that unusual for Spidey. In the comics he encounters many villains in one storyline all the time! I think Sam Raimi stays true to most of the stories in the comics and that is one of the main reasons why Spiderman is so great. ""Spiderman 3"" has some surprises in store (meaning that some plot lines deviate from the marvel comics). A great part of the story is consistent with the spirit of the Spidey universe! However that doesn't mean that ""Spiderman 3"" is perfect. There are some mistakes that can't be easily forgiven. First of is the character Mary Jane. She is so different from the character in the comics. Which becomes painfully obvious in this third part. In the comics she is much stronger and more confident and loves Peter for who he is. In ""Spiderman 3"" she gets jealous because Peter/Spidey gets the fame she longs for.Especially when Gwen Stacy shows interest in Peter. (In the comics it is the other way around. Gwen is Peter's first love and she is jealous of the feisty Mary Jane Parker). And if that isn't enough she even goes as far to betray Peter with his best friend Harry Osborn. Kirsten Dunst portrayal of Mary Jane doesn't help either. It is clear that she isn't familiar with the comics which is a big shame. A second mistake is the twist concerning Ben Parker's murder (Peter's uncle). I know that this plot line is inserted to add some depth to a certain character but ultimately totally unnecessary and ridiculous compared to the first two movies and the comics. The third mistake is the under use of Venom. Archenemy of Spiderman. Surely he should have gotten more screen time. There is however an explanation for this. Sam Raimi is a fan of Spiderman in the early years. And therefore is more familiar with the villains of that period. And that is the main reason why he didn't want to put Venom in ""Spiderman 3"". My guess is that end result is sort of a compromise. Even with the little flaws and mistakes ""Spiderman 3"" is an action adventure not to be missed. It still is a lot of fun!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It has had a lot of stick this movie but i don't think its as bad as everyone makes it out to be. OK it is definitely the weakest of the 3, the storyline revolves around his love for Mary-Jane, his friendship with Harry and the fact that everybody loves Spider-Man now a little too much, but the action scenes are amazing and the special effects are the finest I've seen on a movie, especially the Sandmans baby steps scene...wow! the fight scenes with Sandman & Venom are unbelievable but unfortunately you are left begging for more as they are too short. When I heard there was 3 villains in this one i thought its going to be none stop action all the way but its not. The biggest character in this movie is Peter Parker.All round its an entertaining movie one i will definitely buy on DVD and watch again, but you must make your own mind up on it, the way i look at it, is its Spider-Man, and he will always make blockbuster films because of he's an amazing character whose films bring you breath taking action, good special effects, drama, romance and even comedy. Spider-Man still kicks ass!thanks for reading Rich-Man out...","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Exactly this happened after seeing ""Spider-Man 3"". Flaws of this movie I am unable to count because the whole flick drips with unrealistic character development, cheesy humor and almost total lack of depth. Yet this may be the reason why I enjoyed it so much - this is what comic book adaptation on screen should look like. These were real comic book characters, that you can't find from anywhere in this world. And in a strange way this affects me more than most of the serious and good movies. Only thing that keeps me from giving ""Spider-Man 3"" ten points is the fact that there is ridiculously little time given to Venom who is basically the most enjoyable villain there is. And that is a real shame.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

At the end of the Year they all remembered watching the film clips, but as for the concepts I enjoyed these films more than the the Batman franchise, as to me they seem a bit lighter and with more humour as the former film got a bit unrelenting in the end.The action, which is what holds the thing together after all was fantastic making good use, but not at the expense of the cast, of the available computer enhancements. The opening fight sequence has the feeling of one on one intensity but with a superb backdrop of back street New York.The story shows Parker dealing with his ego and the added power afforded to him by the new entity, which gives him a black costume to go with the temptations to abuse his gifts, but the blackness is made up for with some good comedy scenes in a restaurant and then in a Jazz Club where the erstwhile photographer discovers his inner John Travolta, much to everyone's surprise.The character relationships, complete with the usual romantic complications continue in this picture and we see Parker growing up and becoming far more Worldly Wise, having to deal with adult situations and emotions which osmosise into his alter ego's behaviour. Trouble at work and with his girlfriend, with the added angst of the fallout from his Uncle's death in Part One, add a decent story to complement the action.Sandman is a new character, and an excellent villain engaging in the usual skulduggery (I actually sympathised with him which I'm not sure the writers wanted) but as usual, and predictably the ending turned into a moralising, flag waving tribute to the concept of ""America"". If only the truth mirrored fiction.That's churlish. It's comes with the deal when you buy a ticket and doesn't detract from a fun experience, which is perhaps twenty minutes too long.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Because if not because the director doesn't like Venom then he is really making a fool out of himself like the people who did X-Men did by killing off Jean Grey and Cyclops. But yeah regardless of what other people think I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and look forward to the next segment in this already entertaining and delightful movie franchise. I think in the next movie it would be cool to see Venom comeback and then see a twist with Carnage and the Lizard as the new villains with Venom helping out Spidey and Doc Ock coming back to help Dr. Conners find a cure for his transformation as The Lizard.

I watched nearly the entire animated series when they first came out. However it pains me to see the third installment of this series fall flat under the two previous parts. Spider-Man was good, Spider-Man 2 was great, Spider-Man 3... could have been greater. First big mistake on the part of director Sam Raimi along with Ivan Raimi and the other people who wrote the screenplay was the fact that they tried to squeeze in 2 times more villains than the previous parts put together. Of course, if the movie would have had an epic time length of 4 hours this decision would have been fairly justified. Even more weird is the fact that even though we had this many villains and would have expected an even more action packed movie than the other two, Sam Raimi wanted to make room for tear-jerking, heart-breaking, pity-inspiring drama... he failed miserably. Why? It's not because of the over-exaggeration or the uncalled for soap-opera moments and not even the fact that some things just don't make all that much sense (like Spider-man kissing Gwen in front of his girlfriend as if just wanting to start a conflict, and his even cooler punch line ""She's just a girl from my class"" instead of just saying something like ""I did it for the cameras"") but because of one man: Tobey Maguire. I really appreciate him as an actor and i think he did a great job of playing Spider-Man, but i'll just go ahead and say this: he has 0 dramatic value in the scenes in which he is put. I mean seriously, upon seeing his face when he started crying i couldn't help but laugh. I figured at first that i might be a raving lunatic for transforming such ""dramatic"" scenes into jokes. That is until people in 3 different cinemas (yes i have seen it 3 times) all laughed at the same scenes. Case closed. On the good side, the visual effects were just candy for the retina and i just couldn't help but almost drool at the sight of the battles and the sheer brutality of certain hits (speaking of which Harry Osbourne has a weird habit of just slamming his head into any hard object he can see right?). This was an aspect that made me pass over the drama and tear-jerking (tears of laughter) scenes only to expect another clash of titans. As a conclusion I recommend you go watch this movie with several friends so as to just have a good laugh when seeing Spider-Man cry his blue and red heart out at the thought that Mary Jane is going to dump him. Oh, one more thing. Although i don't appreciate the fact that director Sam Raimi brutally slaughtered the image of Spider-Man when he was wearing the suit by turning him into some crazed 70's disco fanatic, i have to admit it was funny as hell. However, i don't want to see a superhero turned into something like ""that"" any time soon. :D","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Once in a while, a movie comes out that taps directly into the mainstream audience with such power that it resonates its own level of quality. Such is this third installment of Spiderman. Two such contemporary movies have come before - Jaws (1975) and Titanic (1997). Spiderman 3 sets a new standard of excellence for the mass audience movie taking humor, relatively complex plot outline, and incorporating breathtaking action sequences, and a heavy dose of spirituality, betrayal, revenge motif, forgiveness, love and relationships into an amazing package for this era of time. Besides a surprisingly somewhat weak special effects and one weak scene with the Franco and his servant, the overall movie is superb. The depth of emotions and the ethical message is so riveting is so ripe for today's complicated and crumbling societal direction.

So good! Sam Raimi balances all of the story lines, characters and subplots perfectly.Acting: 9/10. Tobey Maguire is once again amazing in his role as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. James Franco is great as well, he played good and bad Harry Osborn/New Goblin perfectly and his development was great. Topher Grace was actually very good is his role as Eddie Brock/Venom. Originally I thought ""eghh, Foreman from That 70s Show"" but he played the perfect Eddie Brock, he was a just being an a**. Thomas Haden Church was a great Sandman. The Only weakness is Kirsten Dunst.Comedy: 8/10. J.K. Simmons was (as always) amazing. The whole Emo Peter thing was funny! Sometimes a little overdone (Jazz Club) but overall funny! Action: 10/10. Best Action Sequences of all 3! Sandman was very interesting as far as effects go! Overall: 9/10, not as good as Spider-Man 2 but what did you expect?

When I looked up some reviews on the internet about this movie, I was amazed about the large amount of negative reviews this movie had gotten. Some of them didn't even labelled this as an average movie, but named it as ""a complete let-down"". This was the total opposite of what I was thinking. Spiderman 3 continues the story were 2 stopped. Peter parker (again brilliantly played by Toby Maguire) still takes on the world of crime as his alter ego Spiderman. Things are going rather well for Peter, since he now found a perfect balance between his social-life and his superhero-life. He has the girl, which is off course Mary-Jane, he wants and his grades are once again far above average. However things are soon starting to go downhill after a new invincible villain shows up, an unknown yet very aggressive virus plants itself in the Spiderman suit, his best friend still wants revenge on him for killing his dad and last but not least, girl troubles. Way to go, Spidey. Let's start by pointing out the biggest flaw of this movie: there are way too many things happening at the same time. It seems like the directors wanted to go all out with the last Spiderman movie they made and that didn't really turned out for the best. Let me get one thing straight, it's not like all these story's make the movie hard to understand. However, if you look up the other Spiderman movies, you can understand what I mean. In part 1 there were two story's: becoming Spiderman and one villain. Number 2 also had two story's: The inner struggle of wanting to be Spiderman and one villain. This movie has 4 story lines: Trouble with his friend who's planning his revenge, Trouble with his girlfriend who can't handle Spiderman's star status and TWO villains. What do you get if you fit twice the amount of content in one movie? Right, story lines that aren't as deep as they should have been. That's really a bummer, because the villains, sandman and venom, just scream for more background story. They give sandman a vague storyline, but there isn't a real conclusion for him. Venom is a cool character, but we only see him in his true form (and in the way we know him) in the last 20 minutes of the movie and that hurts, because he could have been the greatest super villain to hit the white screen by far. At least the other two story's (The troubles with his friend and his girlfriend) are decent, but the background story for those were created in the first two movies. A lot of reviewers claim that this movie doesn't stick to the original comic books. Well I can imagine why someone could find that annoying, but it doesn't concern me since I haven't read every Spiderman comic book there is and I'm sure that at least 80% of the people who see this movie haven't. So for most people this little thing wouldn't even matter. So, you know a few bad things about this movie, but let's be positive now. One thing everyone has to agree with are the quality of the visual effects. They are stunning. It's amazing how intense the directors could have made the battles without making it too unrealistic. No wonder they won the Oscar for best special effects with Spiderman 2. With all these special effects you are happy that there are more villains, cause this whole movie is eye candy. The action in this movie is very good, it's really how a superhero movie should be. If I'm honest then I can say that Spiderman is my favourite superhero (better then overpowered Superman and no powered Batman) and that's all thanks to the Spiderman movies. The great thing about this movie is that it knows that it's a superhero movie based on a comic and for this reason doesn't take itself too serious. It's a feel good action movie and one of the best in its genre if you ask me. After Peter's suit getting infected by the aggressive virus, Peter turns a little bit more to the dark side. However he doesn't turn in the cool, aggressive darker version of Peter Parker that you might picture him to become. Instead he starts wearing fashionable black clothing, hangs around with girls more and picks fights with people on bars. Criticisers say that this doesn't suit Peter at all and he doesn't act really like a bad guy at all. I think they might be missing the point. As I stated before, this movie doesn't take itself too serious. Spiderman becoming a complete bad guy would be a little too serious and the movie would lose a little bit of comedy the series always had. Dark Peter is quite hilarious, it had my laughing at a couple of scenes. Don't think that they messed up Dark Spiderman completely, because when he puts on his suit he is quite the vicious one. I admit that there are a lot of things to point out as bad in this movie, but I'm the kind of person that watches a movie to enjoy myself and not to find as many flaws as possible. Spiderman 3 is a very enjoyable movie, it's not an must-see, but the action, special effects and the cast makes this movie worth watching.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The movie had god-awful dialog and the acting was poor. Venom looked really cheesy, unless Topher Grace's head was showing. It didn't succeed in pulling 3 stories together (Harry Ozbourne, Venom and Sandman).What this movie DID have, however, is humor. And plenty of it! There is a lot of really subtle comedy in this piece and its well worth your time to go look at it. It felt a LOT like evil-dead kind of funny, where its situational and the dialog is just cheesy enough for it to feel like a classic B-Cult flick. I guess what I'm trying to say is, you shouldn't look at this film in the perspective of a Hollywood blockbuster. You should look at this flick in the perspective of a classic Sam Raimi film and just loosen up.That being said, I was very entertained by this movie. It was the first of the Spiderman- movies to actually look and feel like a comic book! It wasn't like watching a film-adaptation of a comic, it WAS the comic. The action-scenes were really well done. They were cool, for lack of a better word. Especially to see Harry on a hover-board, fighting spider-man.There was little character development, which is fine for characters like Peter and Mary Jane, because they're well established from the last two films.. but, characters like Eddy Brock suffer from it.I wish they'd make a reference to Peter's professor the future Lizardman.I don't think they should make a Fantastic 4 sequel (saw the preview in the theater).So, in conclusion: Its funny, entertaining, Bruce Cambell is the best part. Its got terrible dialog, little character development, etc. If you're a big fan of Spiderman, you'd most likely get offended. If you're a really laid back moviegoer, it might be worth your time and money. I really enjoyed this film, even though it butchers the spider-man story..","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Now after 2 years since Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man 3 is here. We've seen the trailer time after time and we're still not bored about it. Why? Because the first two Spider-Man were great and we all love the friendly neighbor hood Spider-Man.When I first saw the trailer I was blown away by the CGI on Sandman. Green Goblin...I mean New Goblin suit is cool although he looks nothing like a goblin. And then trailer after trailer they finally showed Vemon and well...he looks kind of small. And finally, I went to watch Spider-Man 3.I'll try to make this short. The story goes like this. Peter Parker/Spider-Man is still protecting the city and now he finally wanted to pop the question to Mary Jane. Later out of no where New Goblin came and attack Peter. Then Ben Parker actual killer became sandman and terrorize the City. Then an alien came to earth and takes over Peter and Peter became more powerful, then a photographer, Eddie Broke, is threatening Peter's job and Peter is stuck in the middle of Mary Jane and Gwen Stacy.The story is great and it's slightly longer then the first two. Great CGI here. CGI on Sandman blown me away with all those Sand. The action sequence are well planned and beautiful shot and CGI-ed. Vemon is well CGI-ed but still he is still small in size But great work anyway. Everything in this movie is well made. Great script, camera movement, sound, CGI, Director, etc.A must watch for Mavel fans/Spider-Man fans. You'll have to watch it to believe it. It will probably end up as one of the biggest hit in 2007. So don't miss it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This combines elements of campy humor consistent with the comic books, action and a mushy love story-turned-betrayal and whatnot, making it the sort of film you cross your legs real tight to avoid having to take a bathroom break and missing a moment. It was sheer entertainment, exciting and nerve-wracking with dialog that should be hovering from a speech bubble overhead. The second film had so many eye-rolling, lame, supposed-to-be-cute moments with formulaic elements and predictable story lines that I feared the worst when entering the theater, and I was delighted to find that instead of a continuation of this, we were faced with a script that pokes fun at itself and its roots justly, making the characters sympathetic and understandable instead of infuriating.I give it an 8/10 because I enjoyed every second, and for once it seemed that the parts I was laughing at were supposed to be funny.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I even have a tattoo of spider-man on my arm. It's safe to say I'm a pretty big fan. Even I admit there are plot holes in the new spidey flick, and a lot going on, but in all, it was a fun movie, and did what it was supposed to do, entertain you.The Good -1. CGI was incredible, especially the sandman forming for the first time. That was very neat.. 2. Humour - lots of it and from lots of different angles.. 3. Good action sequences for the most part.. 4. The dynamic between Peter and Harry. I like how that was done..The Bad1. Harry butler and his ""revelation"" was a bit silly.. 2. The alien costume that was very cool, but did not really flow like in the comics. Plus, Peter didn't need to have bangs just to let the viewers know he was bad..seemed silly..but his turn as a Wattabe brother was classic.. 3. I like Lowell as the Sandman.. :) (Wings fans?) 3. The bad guy teamup seemed forced. There's no reason for Sandman to go after Spiderman (his character seemed driven by needs for his daughter, not revenge..) with Venom. It would have made it more interesting if Venom had kidnapped the kid to make the Sandman fight Spider-Man and the police.. 4. Topher Grace is good as a little conniving Eddie Brock, but in the Comics, Venom is a huge guy, and it did not really fit.All in all, I was happy with the results. I would give Spider-Man 1 an 8.0 rating as well to match this one, with Spider-Man 2 probably a little ahead of each..Thx.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I believed that the movie offered a good balance between battle scenes and the emotional appeal.Special Effects: I really did like the special effects; at times I believe the effects went by too quickly for a person to really enjoy that particular part of the film. Despite this, they were great. I loved the directing style and camera style. The way in which the movie was but we all enjoy some cheesy romance to bring us out of reality. And I believe it was a master piece of its own. I enjoyed how often times they blurred the background as you see Peter. That itself could be considered a sort of theme, because every time that Peter is somewhat confused is one this happens, like if the world is sort of a blur.Plot: Overall good plot. My first response was damn there are a lot of villains in this movie. But I gave it a fair chance and considered the significance of each villain. Venom was brought back mostly because he was very popular in the comic book, and it does follow along with the motif of choice, and the difference between good and evil. Sandman brought a final sense of closure to the death of Peter's grandfather. It also brought out a potential driving for someone to do something evil. This character also brings up forgiveness, that sometimes we must forget things that have happened and not let our vengeance get to us. The new Goblin, he brought out friendship. I really can' imagine the movie without the three villains because they all add something to the movie to give the audience a sense of closure.Acting/Character development: Toby's acting was generally great, he brought to us that same feeling of good in our heart that we know from the previous movies, and he also brought out how good could be bad easily. He showed this by his hairstyle and dark facial features. Although the dance was awkward, it did offer some comic release to the tenseness of the movie. Kristen Dunst was perfect, but once again she played the Damsel in Distress. I kind of would have like to see her become a little bit stronger. I would have like to get to know venom more. The sandman was very well suited for that role.I would have really like Spiderman to save more people like he did in the previous movies. In this movie he basically just saves the main characters instead of common people like in other movies.As I walked out of the theater I heard people say the two words I hate the most ""IT SUCKED"", I give people all the freedom that they could have their own opinion but I could not honestly say that the movie sucked. It is worth remembering and it gives us a sense of closure to most of Spiderman. The romance was a little cheesy,d rather nicely and it forms a good balance between the male and female audience.Overall I give this movie a 8/10. I walked out of the theater saying to myself that's it, but when I thought about everything I realized that the movie was great.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The second stayed on about the same level though it got a bit lost in trying to expand, but Spider-Man 3 is where the series really lost its footing. At this point the focus of the movie was less on the SpiderMan side and more on Peter Parker. His internal turmoil and personal dilemmas prove to be more of a challenge to the web slinger than any antagonist he fights. Figuratively it has too many pans frying to tend to, which are exposed in a weak structured story that over burdens itself with sentiment. As for the Sandman and Venom: they're mostly an afterthought.Taken all in all, Sam Raimi's SpiderMan trilogy still might be close to the best thing to happen to the genre. As the countless score of inferior MCU movies have proven. He brought strong visuals and his cinematic sense is above pretty much any other filmmaker who's tackled superheros except perhaps for Christopher Nolan. Theyre fairly endurable and Tobey Maguire is actually very good in this part.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I waited and heard all the bad reviews and comments from critics and trusted friends alike.Today, I decide that after all this negativity, I couldn't possibly be disappointed, so would hopefully enjoy it and as such.........gave it a try.I knew already that by trying to cram too much in, in the form of villains (why so many!!!?? it just made the whole thing seem futile), character exploration and endless amounts of self realisation (in many directions) by most, if not all of the characters, that it would seem abit stop start.Nothing could prepare me for the horror that was about to insue........I never thought I would watch a film by Sam Raimi and wish it would end.........especially Spiderman!! something that he had got so right on the previous two visits.The script was awful, inconsistent and not even plausible for a comic book movie. I found the affects to have taken a backwards step in CGI development. The constant too'ing and fro'ing that every single character was doing just got repetitive, predictable and very very boring...........character self realisation and overcoming weaknesses is something that all movies have (although Id love to see a film that builds all that up and then the character Doesn't change and the movie ends!!) but to have so much of this just ruined it all and made me not care at all really.Although the US flag was used in previous Spidey movies, it was always playful, this one's use was blatant and pathetic..........AND the whole scene of ""bad"" Peter Parker was way way over the top, near the end of it my girlfriend was asking me to turn it off as it was soooooooo bad, again in previous movies where there's a playful scene trying to convey a characters feelings/emotions/mood (like Peter strolling along to ""Rain drops keep falling on my head""), this one was too long and seemed to just be filling gaps and pointlessly displaying character traits that meant nothing.Overall, I cant imagine how Id have felt if I was actually expecting something from this movie but I never thought I would dred the next film..........unless Sam can try and return to his old playful, innovative, stylish, trend setting, original self.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I only saw this back when it came out, but now I see that Raimi certainly tried to do a lot more with this film. Part of its flaws comes from the way it all comes together, maybe in part due to it feeling way too rushed. Also, some of the dialogue is pretty bad. But overall, it definitely doesn't deserve all of hate it got when it came out, like at all. Yes, it's more messy, but damn it tries so many things that one can't blame it too much. Not to mention, there are a lot of great individual moments that are probably some of the best in the trilogy. It's incredibly funny as well, and Raimi infuses it with even more camp than before. Maguire and Franco are easily weaker here than in the first two though, and maybe it's because of the more dramatic material but they drag down some of the scenes. Dunst, on the other hand, stands out more than before. Here, because she also has more to work with, she manages to be the MVP of the cast, and it's not until this film that one can truly see how much she was needed in this franchise. Overall, a very good film, if not a great but flawed one/","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The most pleasing aspect to watch in a Spiderman movie is not the extravagant fights but just to watch Spidey swing on his ropes among the urban landscape.And even that was better in Spiderman:1 & 2. Anyways, its an unwritten rule that a Spiderman can never be better or equal to the Batman as a personality; however good the visual/sound effects may be. As much disappointed watching this movie as I was watching 'The Da Vinci Code'. In both cases the material was worthy of a movie adaptation but the execution was poor.

First of all, sandman never should've been a villain, nor should he've been the killer of uncle Ben. This latter was a major plot hole that could fit a fat person. As I recall, in the first movie, when uncle Ben lay dying on the street the police said that they knew where the shooter was heading, yet in this one the shooter was in custody by the police. It also threw the canon out the window. The first movie had perfect structure: peter Parker fought crime out of guilt over uncle bens death because he let the robber get away. Now, according to this film, it was okay for him to be vindictive towards the wrestling promoter that screwed him over. Okay. Goodbye spiderman mission statement. Furthermore. The venom story was structured perfectly, but I think that Eddie Brock should've been going on crime sprees(for economic and vindictive reasons) as the doppelgänger of spiderman, and been the one in cahoots with Harry Osborn up until the end, when Osborn has change of heart. Given these changes, the movie could've been a hands down winner.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's the best of the three and it certainly has the most depth. Everything in this movie is exceedingly better in the sequel. Characters and plot lines that were introduced in the first two films are now given room to thrive and find their own voice and their own distinctiveness. The plot becomes more intricate, the situations become more dire. No comic book movie has ever dug as deep as Spider-Man 3 does here-- these are not only the most complex characters I've ever seen in a super hero movie, they are so well written and full of small, personal moments that they transcend their origins and become living, breathing people whom have pasts, presents and futures. Harry and his emotional baggage, Peter and his multiple dilemmas and inter struggles, Marko and his tragic reason for being a villain, Aunt May and her wisdom all advance a story that we deeply care about. Then, when super powers collide it means more but it's also some of the best action ever presented on film.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Mary Jane continues all the expressions that come under 'wishful thinking' and 'frustration'. The Villains are all good guys-turned evil. I wonder why the producers of Spiderman have forsaken really evil villains. It is easy to see the pattern: Spiderman gets invaded by an alien - he becomes bad - then becomes good. The Sandman gets turned into sand - he becomes bad - then becomes good. The Green Goblin still gets haunted by this father - he is bad - but then gets bumped in the head and turns good. Brock just happens to turn bad, and gets unlucky.And there is only so much swinging you can take. After a while, like a roller coaster ride, it loses its charm. In my opinion, the worst in the series so far.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","A Hurried Mess, But Not Terrible","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2459817/?ref_=tt_urv","trevornaud-108-406839","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur27057887/?ref_=tt_urv","16 July 2011","""Spider-Man 3"" reunites Tobey Maguire, Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, and director Sam Raimi, who also co-writes the script with brother Ivan, and, unfortunately, falls between the same cracks as many other threequels released in 2007 (e.g. ""Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End""): Too much content is forcibly shoved and messily pieced together in too short of a time. As the longest of the three ""Spider-Man"" films by twenty or so minutes, one would think that a little extra layer to the script could work fine in the hands of a talented and innovative filmmaker such as Raimi; but a preponderance of subplots that lack both linearity and substance throughout the overall context of the story, leaves this film feeling out of place and messy in comparison with its much more superior predecessors. In the first film, Raimi, who is very ardent in his belief that not everything in a film needs to be built in the computer, brilliantly integrated a mix of traditional and computer effects into great-looking sequences. This was accentuated in ""Spider-Man 2"", but for this third film the computer effects seem to dominate, taking away from what I found to be part of what made its predecessors so enjoyable. Not only does the computer seem to overtake the film in several sequences (notably the heavy action scenes), but, with more than one exception (the ""Birth of the Sandman"" sequence for instance), the effects look like cheap, quickly-thrown-together renderings. The first two films had brilliant moments of well-placed comic relief (Peter learning to swing in the first film; the lust-struck daughter of Peter's landlord in the second film), but this film seems uncertain as to what genre it is: One minute it feels like a poorly-made drama; one second a cheesy comedy; then it's a musical; a romance - it all feels congested and muddled, and more often than not add nothing but time to the movie.Three villains take the stage this time: Venom (played by Topher Grace); The Sandman (Thomas Haden Church); and Harry Osbourne (James Franco) as an amped-up and wimped-down ""New Goblin"": Unlike the well- staged emotion created between both first William Dafoe's Goblin then Alfred Molina's Doc. Oc in the first and second films, the villains in this film are introduced with no substance, resonance, or realism, thus leaving the inevitable resolve between good and evil during the film's falling action feeling less like a resolve and more like a cheap cop-out of an ending. The only real emotional connection made from screen to viewer is toward the final five minutes of the film, during Church's performance in his final scene, in which he repents his sins and asks for forgiveness.The acting is terrible in the film overall: Maguire, as Parker/Spider- Man is stiff and seems to be trying too hard to be funny; Dunst plays as if she doesn't even want to be part of the project; Franco is halfway between being maniacal and comical; Topher Grace (Eddie Brock/Venom) is un-intimidating and over-the-top. The only two decent performances in the film are those by Rosemary Harris (Aunt May) and Thomas Haden Church as Flint Marko/The Sandman. The film is, nonetheless, well-made for what it is. The bad acting can be justified by a lackluster script, as can be the clutter of the story and the tediousness of the useless subplots and weak villains. Sam Raimi takes what is given him and delivers a film that is neither bad nor good, but enjoyable. While this is by far the weakest of the three films, it is made with skill and style from the director, is decently shot, pieced together well for what there is to work with, - but at the end of it all it still leaves a bit of a sour taste in one's mouth if they are fans of the first two films and expected something up to par. A not-so-bad effort that pieced together a cluttered mess of a story.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With Spider-man 2 being such a ridiculous success, everybody was expecting 3 to be just as good. The expectations were amazingly high, and I'm sure everybody working on the movie felt the pressures. More special effects, more villains, more depth, more battle... Its incredibly hard to get through all of that and stop comparing it and remember that its just trying to be a good movie, not primarily a better sequel. In that, it triumphs. But to be a better sequel, it isn't. Spiderman 2 was better than it, but not by much. Another reason why people are probably slamming this is because of the end with Spiderman and Sandman. It defies logic sure, but it portrays something that not many people find the power in themselves to do at all, with elevates Spiderman to an even greater superhero status, though true a lot of the point of these movies so far was to show that Peter Parker was only human... with special powers.The acting was alright, given the screen time. Another problem is that Sam Raimi tried to pack too much in. The idea of two villains is a great idea, to add more punch and more excitement, as needed to satisfy movie-goers after the first few movies. But the three villains were too complex to fit even into the 139 minutes of movie. Topher Grace, did not get enough time, but again did well with what he gone. Thomas Haden Church, did very well with what he got, and did extremely well as the Sandman, the villain one can understand. The New Goblin is easily understood, but that came from the first two films, and still James Franco just not get enough screen time. The story is basically centred around MJ(Kirsten Dunst) and Peter Parker(Tobey Maguire), and their problems and Peter's battle within. A movie with a lot of potential, but too rushed and too packed.The effects are stunning. Absolutely paramount. The aerodynamic New Goblin, the freakish Venom, the magnificently giant Sandman, perfectly choreographed, everything is amazing. But the battles just don't seem as good as they did in the second, but that again is because of the screen time. The special effects are the best I've seen since The Two Towers, with that charge down that slope remember? Oh man that charge was awesome...anyways...yahhh...All in all, a great third venture. I'm waiting to see if Shrek the Third and POTC 3 are as solid as this.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Even at his very best, Spider Man is still a pretty goofy arch-typical boy hero, dealing with teeny relationship and identity issues. What makes Spider-Man endearing is that he has superpowers and goes on adventures. The problem with this movie is that these normal Spiderman problems were treated way to seriously here, the melodrama between Mary Jane, Parker, and Osbourne got embarissingly thick, with not enough Spidey action to dilute it(though were there was action it was pretty cool). The ""i'm evil and now have emo bangs in my face"" didn't help either, the dance sequence if nothing else helped break up the monotony. The Sandman birth sequence was beautiful though, that minute and half of the movie was the best part of the film. If this film wasn't going for realism it shouldn't have injected the constant tear fests, because this tells the audience they're supposed to be emotionally involved with these ridiculous poorly acted characters. The result can only be awkward laughter and distancing of the viewer from the fantasy world they were immersed in. You can't hero worship someone you don't respect, and the redemption/forgiveness scenario come too little to late, to have their intended effect. This might have made an interesting animated film, but on camera it's just not enough. That being said, I still had fun seeing it in theaters, it is Spider-Man after all, I just wouldn't want to watch it again, exception being the action parts.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Still the opening action scene is exciting and the birth of Sandman is memorable. The CGI is generally impressive. Only the climactic fight scenes feel incomplete, almost straight out of a video game. The acting is uniformly good. People have panned Tobey Maguire but I found his 'bad Parker' scenes quite funny. Topher Grace is good but Venom isn't given enough screen time. A satisfying watch despite its flaws.Overall 7/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

SM2 was deeper and more amusing. Here you feel that the creators wanna put so much eggs in the bag, the result is ""CRUSHHHH!!"".. A random sequence and an untied storyline. Yeah the effects were perfect i admit, but were not placed in their right places. When i saw the trailer and the poster i expected a philiosphical theme about good and evil, revenge and tolerance. The film has talked about these stuffs but in such a shallow way. What i like most in SM movies is the philosiphical backgrounds, they re not just a-hero-and-a-monster movies (not batman if u know what i mean), that's why i was a little bit disappointed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Decent sequel but not up to the original or Spiderman 2","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1694303/?ref_=tt_urv","StanleyStrangelove","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2719706/?ref_=tt_urv","15 July 2007","Spiderman 3 is not as good as Spiderman or Spiderman 2 but for a sequel it's not terrible. Spiderman has to fight three enemies: Sandman, Venom and New Goblin. He also has to fight to maintain his love relationship with Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst). Spidey doesn't do a very good job with any of these problems.An early on chase between New Goblin and Spiderman through the skyscrapers of the city is the best action sequence in the film. Although there are many other chases and fights, they don't seem as exciting. Maybe it's because the film is almost 2 1/2 hours and it sometimes drags.Credit to director Sam Raimi who is, in my opinion, the best action director working today. He does give a lot of screen time to develop the relationships between Spiderman and James Franco who blames him for killing his father and between Spiderman and Mary Jane. Besides that, Raimi has to introduce two new characters, Thomas Hayden Church as Sandman and Topher Grace as Venom.Look for Ted Raimi, Sam's brother, who he always gives a small part to and who, as usual, is very funny, and also for Bruce Campbell, another actor who is always in Raimi's films, who is a riot as a French maitre d' and whose part got big laughs from the audience.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Hook Up To The Web!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2325087/?ref_=tt_urv","TheKarateSpider","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24081195/?ref_=tt_urv","16 October 2010","I've got some really mixed feelings about Spider-Man 3. It manages to divide me like no other film has done before or since. On one hand i find it to be a big, enjoyable, living comic book akin to Superman 2, with awesome action sequences not to mention good humour and heart. On the other hand i remember reading the comic book series on which the movie is based, and will freely admit that Sam Raimi fails to get the best out of the storyline as its presented in Spider-Man 3, and its tantalising to wonder what a director who was a fan of the whole Venom/Alien Symbiote storyline, could have came up with. The movie is about half an hour too long and Raimi really got the mood and atmosphere needed to tell that part of the story quite simply wrong. I feel Tobey Maguire is sleep walking through the role this time almost as if he is fed up with the character, which is a shame because he is required to carry the film to the best of his ability. Also the character of Eddie Brock is presented almost as an after thought as is the character of Gwen Stacey played by Bryce Dallas Howard, who is a great actress but seems to be in this film just so Spidey will rescue her. Thomas Hayden Church is spot on as Sandman, looking so much like the character whilst putting a human spin on him. The storyline is a little convoluted but aside from playing a darker side of Peter which you aren't required to like, you end up not liking him all the same. The Alien Symbiote storyline is a worthwhile addition to the Spider-Man movie mythology, but doesn't come off as well as it might and the character of Venom just falls flat. That said there is a lot to enjoy in Spider-Man 3, the action sequences and special effects are first class as always, but its the script, despite being fun, that lets it down. So the Sam Raimi/Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies come to an end, they were at times very enjoyable, and i for one cant wait to see the Andrew Garfield/Marc Webb reboot, should be awesome.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"","","Fairly Disappointing","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1680928/?ref_=tt_urv","ParanoidAndroid879","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3953559/?ref_=tt_urv","25 June 2007","The third spidey features the classic foes The sandman who can turn himself into sand. Venom who is an alien symbiote who transforms the wearer into something totally different. Sandman is a crook on the run and runs into a atomic particle testing area this turns him into the particles they were testing, sand. Meanwhile peter faces issues with harry now the Green Goblin 2. Eventually the alien symbiot takes control of peter completely altering his life. Thus the battle within himself begins.I was extremely disappointed in this movie. It has its usual scenes with spidey kicking the baddies butt. but the movie has some extreme problems.The biggest problem with this movie would have to be the lack of Venom. He seemed way to forced into this movie. There is also a half hour scene that focuses way too much peters love life and personal issues. The problem with this is that its kind of hard to take comic book characters seriously. Kids also love to go see spidey and they may get bored through some of it.I understand how they are trying to give villains more morales but i think they go a bit too far in this one. Especially because Venom is the one in the comics who has some morals in this movie he has no morals. The movie is semi decent but drags on at some points and extremely disappointing because i expected fantastic. Well spidey 4 might have carnage and hopefully the whole story will revolve around him.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Was really confusing and barely made sense. Impressive visual with great effects and choreography. The Venom and Sandman character design was pretty good. Good music and sound choices. Solid acting and ok dialouge. The characters were really puzzling. All the buildup from the last movie completely diminished.Memorable: No
