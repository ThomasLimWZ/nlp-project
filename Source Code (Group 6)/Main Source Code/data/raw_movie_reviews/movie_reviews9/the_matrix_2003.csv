"6","/10","Can not follow up on the first part","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6916563/?ref_=tt_urv","Toph-22","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur104180774/?ref_=tt_urv","14 May 2021","'Matrix Reloaded' wants too much and wants to go one better on everything. What was the non plus ultra in the first part is now playschool. Agent Smith becomes an entire army, one guard becomes a quarter of a million.The same goes for the special effects. I don't need to see something in slow motion every 5 minutes just to make it look cool. Quantity instead of quality seems to be the motto here. Used purposefully, this is definitely a suitable stylistic device. Unfortunately, it is used randomly.Basically, the movie digresses into inanities, especially in the early stages. I'm thinking of this several-minute rave in Zion, for example. The movie wants to give insights into the everyday life of people living in reality. This is basically the logical next step, but unfortunately 'Matrix Reloaded' doesn't manage to relate to the people at any time. Everything seems sterile and unapproachable.In the first part, fight sequences were used quite purposefully. Every fight had its meaning. Here, I have the feeling that the fights are pure show interludes.'Matrix' didn't just stand out because of the action, but also brought a philosophical approach into play. Unfortunately, this approach is almost completely thrown overboard in the sequel. That's a shame, because it's a feature that can set it apart from the normal action genre.The point that really bothers me the most is the transformation of Neo into a kind of Superman. He can do anything and seems almost invincible. I generally find these types of characters difficult, because it's hard to identify with them.Finally, one plus point of the movie. The scenes on the freeway were really good. I would have liked to see this kind of staging for the rest of the movie as well.In summary, 'Matrix Reloaded' falls far short of following in the big footsteps of its predecessor. More should have been made of the strengths and special features of the first part.","14 out of 15 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The only thing this film lacks is the element of surprise!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1255290/?ref_=tt_urv","MinorityReporter","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4064696/?ref_=tt_urv","4 January 2006","The Matrix Reloaded has everything you could possibly want from a summer blockbuster but it like its predecessor has a heck of a lot more and while Reloaded is not as good as the first Matrix film it sure is close to the standard of the original. I don't understand the seeming reluctance to accept this film a suitable continuation of the original film. I'll be the first one to admit that Reloaded has a few slow points and that the story line has a tendency towards the pretentious but the film is also highly intelligent and entertaining but most importantly the film gets the story from A to B with adequate and in some cases remarkable character development.Acting wise the film is in the same kind of league as the first film of the series with a few mediocre performances, a few decent performances and one or two excellent performances. Keanu Reeves plays Neo pretty much like he did in the first movie and that is not bad. His monotone voice is canceled out by his clear and well defined body language. His overall performance is very fitting for the character which, lets face it, is somewhat square and Keanu's acting fits that kind of character very well. Carrie-Anne Moss has taken a small step down. I don't blame her as much as I blame the writing. Her character, while still ass-kicking, is too dependent on Neo. I know they love each other but come on. Laurence Fishbourne shines as Morpheus. His performance is slightly more stylized than in the first film but he steals almost every scene he is in. Other semi-known actors make glorified cameos. Actors like Jada Pinkett Smith, Monica Bellucci and Lambert Wilson are great examples. Gloria Foster returns as the Oracle in her (sadly) last performance as she died during the filming. Her one brief scene is both highly interesting and well acted. As it was with the first film Hugo Weaving provides the best acting by far. Although his screen time is somewhat limited he manages to leave a lasting impression and becomes one of my favorite screen baddies of all time. His performance is for lack of a better word fantastic.Effect wise Reloaded is a feast. There is literally something to look at in every scene. The ""real"" world has been given a face lift to make it more interesting. The real effects, however, take place inside the matrix and just like in the first film the effects are absolutely ground breaking. Rivaling the likes of Star Wars and LotR and that is saying something. The people who think the story is pretentious and the dialog stubby will undoubtedly get their adrenaline fix in the action scenes. Some scenes had me holding my breath and gasping at how beautiful and overwhelming it all was and as much as I love the philosophical aspects of the film I can watch it for the effects themselves as well. Without spoiling anything I can say that lovers of cool fight scenes and fx are in for a hell of a treat with this one.In terms of costumes the film has really grown into its own. Especially Neo's costume in The Matrix is very cool and is a great improvement over the previous film. Morpheus' and Trinity's costumes are the same with minor changes and they still look cool. Agent Smith's costume has changed slightly in the color scheme. His suit has become a bit darker as if to signify that he is no longer an Agent of the system but a rogue agent now. Also his sunglasses have changed so that they look more rounded so they look more like Neo's sunglasses which of course implicates their connection. Many of the secondary characters have their own costumes as well mirroring their own personalities.Were the film separated itself from other action packed films is of course in the underlying philosophical and religious aspects. Once the film has been watched a few times for the effects you can begin to see some of the elements. I don't think its possible to fully translate and analyze every element of the film. Mainly because every element can be analyzed in a bunch of different ways. Without spoiling too much I can say that if you look hard enough you will be able to find Plato, Baudrillard, Gnosticism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Christian elements and some more. The people who tell matrix lovers to get a life for searching the Matrix for a deeper meaning ought to open their eyes and watch the film one more time. With that I'm not saying that you can't be intelligent if you don't like the Matrix I am simply asking you to give it another chance. You really won't regret it.The Matrix Reloaded is an excellent film and it deserves a lot more respect than it is getting and it is definitely underrated. I don't expect people to agree but I do expect people to respect those who love the Matrix sequels like me. I for one think that its hard to go wrong with Reloaded as it is funny, moving, awe-inspiring and very intelligent. I highly recommend this film to anyone.9/10","193 out of 273 found this helpful.

"6","/10","The Matrix Reloaded: Visually stunning, utterly confusing!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1932580/?ref_=tt_urv","Dillypogo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur14427865/?ref_=tt_urv","19 August 2008","""What's going on?"" ""Man, that was cool."" ""Jesus, I need a dictionary."" These three things went through my mind while I watched The Matrix Reloaded. Keanu Reeves returns as Neo, who goes to the city of Zion along with Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss.) As approaching sentinels get closer and closer to the city, an old enemy (Hugo Weaving) pops up again, determined to destroy Neo. As if that weren't enough, Neo has a dream about Trinity dying and he wonders if it will come true.The premier problem with The Matrix Reloaded is that it's incredibly confusing. For the majority of the film I couldn't understand what was going on or who new characters were. For example, Lambert Wilson plays a French character called Merovingian and after four viewings of the film, I still don't know what purpose his character serves.There is a scene near the end of the film in which you will definitely need a dictionary beside you. People who have seen the film will know that I am talking about the scene with The Architect, (Helmut Bakaitis) who has the widest vocabulary in the universe. I understand that it works for his all-knowing character, but what I don't understand is....well, what the bloody hell he's going on about. An example of a sentence he says is ""you are the eventuality of an anomaly, which despite my sincerest efforts I have been unable to eliminate from what is otherwise a harmony of mathematical precision."" What? The saviour of The Matrix Reloaded are it's jaw-droppingly brilliant action sequences. Amazingly choreographed and with top-notch special effects, they are what The Matrix trilogy is famous for. I have to say that The Matrix Reloaded definitely has the best action sequences out of the three films and two of my favourite movie scenes are actually from this. My personal favourite scene is when Neo battles an army of Agent Smiths for about eight minutes. Rob Dougan's music during these action sequences also add to the suspense.Like any sequel, The Matrix Reloaded will always be compared to its predecessor, which is not good for TMR. The first film was more intelligent and intriguing, but the action sequences in the sequel were slightly better.With a confusing plot, The Matrix Reloaded disappoints, but the action sequences are top-notch. I give it 6/10.","98 out of 135 found this helpful.

But next to that, it is obvious that this sequal to The Matrix (1999)takes the story to a whole new dimension. Different characters define the working of the matrix, and the meaning of life itself, in different ways, depending on their onthological background. A conclusion is not (yet) given, which adds to the movie a kind of postmodern quality. For as far as the action sequences are concerned: Groundbreaking. You'll see stuff that you've never seen before. Sometimes the scenes are a little lengthy, which harmes the narrative, but that is compensated easily by the visual spectacle. And yes, the Architect at the end is difficult to understand, but when you watch the film more than once, you'll find out that it does make sense what he says. All together this movie may not be as fantastic as 'The Matrix', but it is definitely a good movie that will keep you thinking for a while.","115 out of 158 found this helpful.

However, after watching ""Revolutions,"" which I found to be a significant improvement, I decided to give this one another shot. The first time around, I found myself wondering where the story was headed, only to feel like it led nowhere. ""Revolutions,"" on the other hand, does take you there.Understanding that ""Reloaded"" is essentially the first half of a larger story, my perspective on its first act shifted. With this knowledge, the initial portion of the film becomes more engaging. Although the action scenes tend to drag on a bit too long, they are undeniably impressive, and upon revisiting the film, I found myself able to appreciate them more without the distraction of wondering about the plot.Perhaps it would have been clearer if they had labeled this movie as Part One.My main issue with the film lies in its uneven pacing. There's over an hour of exposition, followed by lengthy action sequences that lose their relevance to the plot halfway through. While both the dialogue and action scenes are well-executed, a bit more variety in pacing would have made the viewing experience smoother and more balanced. Fortunately, the final third of the film addresses this issue.Upon rewatching, I found ""Reloaded"" to be much more enjoyable. When viewed together, the two films form a cohesive narrative structure, akin to watching ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and pausing it after Darth Vader's arrival at Cloud City, only to resume six months later.I encourage you to give it another chance. You may find yourself pleasantly surprised.","6 out of 6 found this helpful.

Although I haven't a reason to doubt that, the 2nd (and 3rd) Matrix fall in the tradition that many sequels of good movies suffer from.Despite the fact that practically the same cast and crew who created the magnificent first part is here for the 2 & 3 (they shot it back-to-back) the movie quickly loses its spirit.First mistake is the introduction of many many new secondary characters who might not necessarily needed. And these characters are trying really hard to pose as important without that being the case at all.Second mistake is the forced philosophy that didn't actually had anything to add to that of the original. The attempt for a recreation of the perfectly scripted dialog between Neo and the Oracle in the original is a failed one. For some, including me, it even destroys the feeling of the original dialog by diminishing its great themes.Third mistake the (experimental) visual effects this time look completely fake. There is a big fight, shot with something that is described as virtual cinematography, and it's more than obvious that...well..it needs lots of work to be believable.In conclusion when you are trying for bigger and better there is no guaranty that you will succeed. A common thing in movie sequels. A curse, that struck the second (and the third) sequels of the Matrix.","45 out of 65 found this helpful.

The first Matrix film is a cinematic masterpiece and one of my favourite films. But Reloaded fails to live up to that significantly.There is no story, plot or even good acting. The incredibly bad story of Reloaded fails at even having a complete story. Reloaded consists of fight scene after fight scene missing that heart of the first one. There's also basically no plot and you will most likely not even make out what's going on. And even the acting takes such a downfall it is laughable.The movie is also poorly made from a cinematography perspective. With massive amounts of fight scenes, you would think that you could tell what's going on at least. But you really don't, a shaky camera and bodies flying everywhere it makes it incredibly hard to tell.I was extremely disappointed with Matrix Reloaded but I still recommend you watch it if you enjoyed the first one. It follows the same dark gritty narrative that the first one created but fails at living up to it.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

Like him, I believe that much of the hype surrounding ""The Matrix"" and its sequels is nothing more than shallow philosophy mixed with allegorical and metaphorical strains of the Bible, among various other religious texts and two guys love of comic books. Do I believe any of it? Absolutely not, and I honestly hope that the people who seem to watch these movies religiously do not believe any of the things they say about it either.It's been four years since the first ""Matrix"" film wowed audiences back in 1999 with its special effects and mind-bending story. It has since been followed by a frighteningly devoted fan base, countless books and various interpretations of the plot line. I don't view the ""Matrix"" movies as anything more than a ""Christ"" parable and a very shallow one at that. The movie has its influences deeply rooted in Christianity (the most obvious), as well as Japanese comic books (Manga), Anime (""Ghost in the Shell"" and ""Akira"" come first to mind), Hong Kong action flicks, and countless other sources that have been rolled into one hell of an action film.And also like Ebert, I make these statements with amusement, not criticism, mixed with a little bit of bewilderment. You see, like most movie-going people, I was put into awe by the special effects and story. I loved the first film and it's a classic, believe me. The first ""Matrix"" film is an obvious achievement in special effects and a landmark in science-fiction,but unfortunately its sequels aren't bringing anything new to me and (obviously) to others, which brings me to ""The Matrix Reloaded.""The cons:The biggest problem I have with ""Reloaded"" is that it many times tries to be deep and meaningful but fails miserably most of the time. The fight scenes aren't really worth any particular mention (the only exception being the ""88 Smiths"" and the much-talked about 14-minute ""Freeway"" chase) either. Many of them only seem to be in this movie to eat up time and don't have any significance to the story.That, to me seemed to be the biggest fault with ""Reloaded."" In ""The Matrix,"" the big lobby scene in which Neo (Keanu Reeves) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) get into a huge shootout with a S.W.A.T. team, signaled the start of a glorious rebellion within the system but not only that, kept your eyes glued to the screen for the rest of the movie, all the way up to when the credits start to roll and Rage Against the Machine plays on the soundtrack.The fights in ""Reloaded"" are too repetitive and seem to take forever to be over. Also, the romance in this film seemed to be way too tacked on to be believable. I wanted to see Neo and Trinity become a couple but I have to say that they have no chemistry on screen whatsoever. Their love scene is intercut with a huge mosh pit scene about 30 minutes in after Morpheus gives this huge inspirational speech and everybody goes nuts.Any plusses? Well yeah, that's why I gave it a six out of ten. I have to say, that while the fight scenes seem to be a bit on the excessive side, they're extremely well executed. The cinematography is beautiful, giving ""Reloaded"" a unique and eerie look. The ""flying"" scenes with Neo are very well done too.To sum up:""The Matrix Reloaded"" was at best, failed potential but it shows what happens when you try to put too much into one movie.P.S: If I want a science-fiction movie with real philosophy (emphasis on ""real""), I'll go and watch ""Blade Runner,"" ""The Terminator,"" or ""Ghost in the Shell,"" the latter film was a key (read: obvious) influence of the ""Matrix"" films.6/10","17 out of 31 found this helpful.

But after watching Revolutions, which I thought was much better, I gave this another chance. The first time you are of course wondering where the story is taking you and it ends up being basically no where. Then Revolutions does go there.Because Reloaded is a second movie, it's the first half of the second movie. With that knowledge this first act becomes much better. Sure the action scenes go on a little too long, while they are very cool, but the second time when you aren't wondering about the plot you can enjoy them a little more.Maybe it would have be easier if they called this movie part one.My only problem with this movie is that it's uneven. There is over an hour of laying down plot line after plot line. Then action scenes that are very long and lose their significance to the story about half way through.Now all of the dialogue and action scenes are very good but there should have been a little bit of break up to make it easier on us and even it out. The last third corrects this problem though.Very good after a second viewing. The two movies are structured like one movie.

Although it might not be as good as the first one in terms of it shocking us the way it did in 99 when it brought to us such a new flavour in cinema in terms of development in action, special effects and its terrific story. All and all it still held up very well considering the pressure this movie had on its shoulders to live up to the great expectation.I think that's why a lot of people weren't real keen on this one, because it had such huge pressure, and whatever the Wachowski's produced, it wasn't going to be good enough, or people would say it could or should of been better. I believe the Wachowski brothers made it more epic and like most sequels, you can tell that it had a s*** load more money to work with. Apart from the Zion scene and the Twins not getting enough screen time, this movie was right up there, and for a movie just to sit back in awe and watch all these fighting sequences, car chases and special effects in action, it's a special movie.Well done Larry and Andy showing everyone just why we go to the movies, Pure escapism and entertainment.","77 out of 135 found this helpful.

This is a dynamic, fast-paced and amusing movie , though overlong . It's an enjoyable , if somewhat light-headed piece of escapism with state-of-art special effects and straightforward screenplay . Big-budgeted film by the great producer Joel Silver led to break into the booming Sci-Fi/adventure/fantasy market plenty of inventiveness and imagination . Full of action, it's complemented by rousing scenes , breathtaking flights and struggles are spotlights . It deals with Neo (Keanu Reeves) ¨who is thought to be the chosen one¨ and the rebel leaders estimate that they have 72 hours until 250,000 probes discover Zion and destroy it and its inhabitants. During this, Neo has to decide how he can save Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) from a dark fate in his dreams and he must find Merovingian (Lambert Wilson who is accompanied by a gorgeous Monica Bellucci). It is a dark time for the world in this second adventure. The epic war between man and machine reaches a thundering crescendo : the Zion military, aided by courageous civilian volunteers and led by councillor Hamann (Anthony Zerbe) desperately battle to hold back the marauding Sentinel invasion from overtaking the last human fortress . Neo, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity race against time and are advised by the Oracle (Gloria Foster) to encounter the Keymaker (Randall Kim) who would help them reach the Source. While the human city of Zion is preparing for the oncoming war with the machines with very little chances of survival. The city , the last outpost of humanity , is defended by valiant warriors (Harry Lennix, Gina Torres , Nora Gaye) against the massive invasion of the machines to save the humanity as Neo fights to end the war at another front while also opposing the rogue Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving).This is an action-packed, booming following with some of the best vehicles scenes ever filmed , including awesome visual effects by John Gaeta. This thrilling movie contains impressive fights , chills , breathtaking designs , dense philosophy and many other things . From the beginning to the end the comic-book action-packed and extreme violence is continued and it's fast movement ; for that reason the picture is pretty amusing ; furthermore contains lots of car crashes on a California freeway and spectacular combats in mart arts style staged by Yue Woo Ping who also made ¨Kill Bill¨ and ¨Crouching tiger, hidden dragon¨ . Contrived beyond belief with spectacular races that play like video games , but slickly calculated to please 2000s audiences . Moving and pulsing musical score by Don Davis . Magnificent , glamorous production design by Owen Paterson . Colorful and imaginative cinematography by Bill Pope . The motion picture is stunningly written , produced and directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski-The Wachowski Brothers- .The following to this futuristic saga results to be ¨Matrix Revolutions¨ in which takes place the final battle between machines and humans ; it holds similar artistic and technician team . And being preceded by the classic ¨Matrix¨ in which Neo aware the world he is living in is an illusion maintained by machines that have taken over earth .","17 out of 26 found this helpful.

And this film has one and one thing wrong with it. And that it's too god damn confusing.I have never watched any of the Matrix films before so this is all a new experience to me. I sat down and really focused and watched every single second that was offered. And I still don't understand it. In fact I lie, I understand maybe 50% of it. Like there are scenes and characters that just don't offer anything to the plot, but are there to confuse and nothing more. There's some guy that speaks French, he's in for about 10 mins and that's it. What's his purpose other than to add 10 mins to the film and confuse me a bit more? I really really wish I understood it more and I could admire it. But I can't. Maybe this is a film you have to see 3/4 times to get it, I don't know, but from first viewing it's hard to get.The action scenes are phenomenal. 17 years later and these scenes still hold up more than enough today. I was in genuine awe at some of the action and the fighting that was displayed. It was honestly amazing. The film is worth watching for this alone.But yeah, I enjoyed my time watching this. Just dead confusing.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

That was way too drawn out and just unnecessary. We get it, they are dancing, and Neo and Trinity are making love, get on with it.Second, the whole scene with Neo and the Counselor. They have a lengthy conversation seemingly about nothing. What relevance did that have to anything? We were introduced to so many characters in Zion only to have them mean absolutely nothing in the end.Oh, and while we are on the topic of Zion... how did they manage to make such an advanced city underground? Did they have time to drag billions and billions of dollars worth of equipment down with them while the machines were on their tails, eager to kill them?Third: all of the action. It didn't add anything to the plot. Neo spends 15 minutes fighting all of the Smiths when he could have just flown away immediately after he realized it was a swarm.The fight between that random programmer in order to get to the oracle...Neo's Jackie Chan-esque fight scene on those stairs.The 20 minute chase scene with trinity, Morpheus, and the keymaker... don't even get me started on that.And how about those ghostly dreadlock twins...All of those scenes seemed to just fill the time as the real storyline: the looming destruction of humanity was sprinkled in.3/10","57 out of 90 found this helpful.

I wanted to see more, I felt like they had just scratched the surface. But here I am, three years later, seing Matrix Reloaded for the first time. I can't lie, all the talk of people saying ""the last two suck"" and stuff, sort of made me not wanted to rush to see the other two. Idk, if that was good or not, but it was definitely a factor, and for sure made me watch this one with other eyes. Take that as you want.I have no idea why all that introduction, but well, I don't think the movie sucks necessarily, but is definitely not the ""more"" I ended the first movie wanting to see. Some few points here, it's definitely hard to evaluate something that did so much to the revolution of technology in film, and almost created a genre of its own, but oddly enough, this one for sure didn't aged as well as the first one. Mainly the full CGI scenes, where they change it up the actors for the full digital models of themselves, well... you can notice clearly, and at times can take you out of the movie a bit. It's that same old problem of, a first movie that had a smaller budget, and in the sequel with more movie they just went for it, and well... screwed the in-camera fight scenes (still there are a lot of them tho) But then again, that doesn't make the movie that much worst or better, imo, is just dated, and it prevents the film from having fully amazing sequences from start to finish.But idk, I like some of the new stuff they added, like the human city, I don't know if I quit understood the whole paradox of the chosen one thing fully... nevertheless, I liked it lol. But well, the movie is just weird at times, there are entire sequences I feel don't add to much at all, like the whole party in the city, in slow motion with people naked... idk, it just felt like adding to not much at all. Some of the fight sequences are great (like the one with the French guy crew), but others... are probably ""too great"" if that makes sense. Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike them, but some of the fight scenes, like the first one with the bunch of Smiths, seemed like they go for sooo long, that at one point it doesn't feel like there is something in play here, it's just a dance of sorts, between Neo's CGI doll, and the dozen of Smiths (they even use bowling sound effects at some point).And well, I can't truly judge the movie that much cause... it doesn't have an ending! (At least back then they released it in the same year, which is still an insane thing to think about nowadays).To sum up, Matrix Reloaded, isn't as good at the first one for sure, and, sadly I didn't think it built the world as much as I wanted. I still love the concept, I love almost everything about Neo's power in the Matrix (the ones that aren't fully CGI dolls), but some scenes seemed to led to nothing at all, and they probably overdid with some fight sequences. Also, I have to give them credit, the car chase scene is awesome.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

I loved the new movie, but the talent was there in the first one, you can just tell that in the sequel the Wachowski brothers had a virtually endless budget, which allowed them to do pretty much anything they wanted. They have a very distinct style that is clearly evident in all of their movies, even if they are not laden with special effects. The fluidity of the camera movement and the strangely dark tones of their films are only a couple of the techniques that make them recognizable. These things really come to the surface if you watch the Matrix films, some of the most recognizable films ever made, and then watch an earlier one of their movies, like the trashy 1996 thriller, Bound.That being said, I think it's safe to say that, despite the massive and seemingly unsurpassable genius of the first Matrix film, the Wachowski brothers have made another step up from their last film. It should be noted that the film is the second part in a trilogy, especially before groaning out loud at the sudden ending of the film, which built up and built up and built up and then just stopped, just like the fist Lord of the Rings film did. I won't take time here to go into what the story is about and how it continues the story from the first film, if only because plot summary in film reviews is a total waste of time for the writer as well as the reader, and also because I've only seen the movie twice, which really isn't enough to get a total grasp on the depth of the plots, so I'll just suffice it here to say that the startling complexity of the original Matrix (a complexity which is almost unheard of in a science fiction film) is added onto and expanded in this film, although despite being hard to follow, is never confusing.I've heard all kinds of talk about the Italian Job having an even better car chase than The Matrix Reloaded and how the chase in this film wasn't even that good at all, blah blah blah. There is a freeway chase scene in this film which recklessly promotes reckless driving (and, even worse, reckless riding), but it is one of the most impressively made and fascinating car chase scenes that I've ever seen. It also contains the characteristic style of the Wachowski brothers, and is famously filmed on a freeway that was constructed strictly for the filming of this scene. I can't remember where, Australia, I think. Anyway, Morpheus and one of the agents are having a kung-fu fight on top of a semi trailer (which the driver never seems to notice), the poor keymaker in struggling to stay out of the way, Trinity is flying between cars against traffic on one of the most badass motorcycles on the road (enter the Ducati commercial), and Morpheus is off doing, as they say, `his superman thing.'The superman thing is one of the elements of the movie that bordered on being campy, as the multitude of Agent Smiths comment to themselves, `He's still only human.' And then in the next scene he's flying. This is one of the points where you really need to keep in mind that Neo's body is plugged into a machine, in the strikingly less appealing real world, and is basically playing a video game where he'll die in real life if killed in the game because his body will think that it has been killed for real and will shut down.During the freeway scene, there's a camera shot where the camera literally goes right through the chassis' of a couple of semi trucks as it follows Trinity, which I think got the biggest reaction from an audience in a single scene that I've seen since that Velociraptor jumped up at the ceiling in Jurassic Park. One of the other most memorable scenes is the lengthy fight scene between Neo and the hordes of Agent Smiths, one of the most entertaining fight scenes I've ever seen. It's obvious that the vast majority of this scene is special effects (and not only because there are hundreds of the same guy in it), but it is so well made and convincing and even amusing that the entertainment value of it is massive.
The new villains, by the way, are some of the best new villains since the Reapers in Blade II. I've heard something about an albino interest group that's trying to sue for the way albino's are portrayed in this movie because of these guys, although I can't exactly agree that they're even albinos. These guys are so weird looking they're barely human. If the albino interest groups are trying to sue, why didn't they sue when Me, Myself, and Irene was released? Anyway, these guys have the interesting skill of becoming transparent and therefore untouchable, with the small condition that they are also unable to attack when in this defensive mode, which makes for some great fight scenes as well as some cool tricks, like that of hopping into rapidly approaching Escalades (oh, there are lots of Cadillac commercials here, too). I heard recently that Cadillac is trying to aim for a younger audience than the much older people who tend to drive their cars, and if there were ever any doubts that the rumors are true, they are completely dispelled by their heavy placement in this movie.
There are certainly some scenes in this movie where it drags and seems to even border on being unnecessarily philosophical and confusing, such as in the extensive meeting with the Oracle, who tells Neo all about choices that he has made but doesn't know he's made yet, or needs to make even though fate has already determined what decision he would make, or something of that nature, where after a while we find ourselves (or at least I did) paying more attention to the pigeons walking around in this startlingly different atmosphere than to the deep conversation that they're having. Maybe this is why it takes me more than two viewings to get the complete story of movies like this. Blasted pigeons.There is a lot of controversy over the quality of The Matrix Reloaded, which is to be expected, since it is a movie that has garnered such a vast amount of attention, even if only because it is the follow-up to such a massively successful film. But like Terminator 3, I personally was hugely impressed with this sequel, and am more than able to accept it as a bridge between the original and the final film in the series. It is the better part of three hours long, but goes by much faster than anticipated because it is so well made and entertaining. Never mind that totally campy scenes, like the bullet removal scene and the dance club scene, because like so many other sequels these days (and unlike so many others), The Matrix Reloaded will leave you eager to see the next one.","106 out of 209 found this helpful.

Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) believes that Neo (Keanu Reeves) is the key to defeating the machines. Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) is now with Neo. Meanwhile the machines have start digging, and will breach Zion in 72 hours. Also Agent Smith is now free from the code and is even more powerful.It's a good start to the second installment of the series from the Wachowski brothers. There's a ticking clock. It's leading to a big battle. We're going to see Zion for the first time. Agent Smith is even more powerful. But then we get to Zion.Zion is a sweaty mess. And for people with 72 hours to live, these people go have a dance party. Instead of great running battles, the first half is a very, very excruciatingly slow grind. The program world has some interesting ideas, but that also gets too slow at times. There are too many slow expositions. There is generally too much talking and not enough doing.I still love the kung fu fighting. The addition of the twins is quite nice. The first fight against the Agent Smiths is a disappointment. It turns into a CGI video game. That's never been cool in a movie to keep switching from real stunts to CG animation cartoons. Other fights are much better. Even the later fight against the Agent Smiths is pretty good.The best part is the big highway chase. That is an amazing bit of movie-making. It's a super fun time. And I like Colonel Sanders. He's uniquely original. He's certainly memorable.Overall the first half is a major drag. The movie gets better in the second half. It's a disappointing sequel, but still has great sequences.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

However, I was not quite ready to line up at the door donned in a Neo costume for a midnight showing on opening day. Having seen Reloaded, I can now say that I may be one of those people (sans the Neo costume) when The Matrix:Revolutions is released this winter. I cannot say that I think that Reloaded was as good as the original. Yes, it contained more action. Yes, the special effects were better. Yes, both the plot and the dialogue were more intricate and at times more head scratching. But Reloaded lacks what its predecessor had, the element of complete surprise. The wool has already been removed from our eyes. We know what the Matrix is. I cannot think of any plot twist that will be able to match what happens when Neo swallows the Red Pill. All that being said, after seeing Reloaded, I now appreciate the story as a whole. The Matrix and The Matrix:Reloaded when viewed as one complete story far surpasses viewing each as it's own single entity. While the original had mildly peaked my interest, I am now fully enthralled by the entire mythology of The Matrix (I highly recommend viewing the back stories available online on the Animatrix). Much like The Lord of the Rings series, I can no longer imagine The Matrix without contemplating Reloaded. As for Reloaded as a movie itself, the fight scenes are amazingly choreographed, though sometimes a little excessive. I would recommend the movie for the fight with the multiple Agent Smiths alone, as it is a phenomenally staged battle. My criticism lies mostly in the editing. This is a movie that could have definitely been shorter. Many scenes were unnecessarily long, such as the dance orgy after Morpheus' speech, or flat out unnecessary, such as Neo's fight with Seraph. But beyond the flashy fight scenes and special effects, its strength lies in the most unlikely (to me at least) of places, its story. It is a movie full of philosophical questions and religious allusions. The end scene with the Architect in and of itself warrants a second viewing, as it is quite a bit to wrap the brain around. And the way it handles its main theme is done exquisitely. What is reality? Is the ""real world"" just another part of the Matrix? Is Neo The One? All questions I will be asking as I stand in line for the midnight opening of The Matrix:Revolutions.","41 out of 75 found this helpful.

That first hour is remarkably lame, often seeming like some stodgy gladiator epic from the '50s, and containing a remarkable stupid and unnecessary bacchanal.But although it is vastly inferior to the original, with a story that never draws you in and has neither an ending nor a good cliffhanger (the end just left me scratching my head, unclear as to why that last shot is worthy of portentous music), the movie isn't completely worthless. While the fight scenes feel more like dance scenes, with no sense that a real fight is going on, they are fun, well choreographed, and at times quite ingenious, most notably in that short fight inside a car. And while there's a lot of sophomoric crap about free will and predetermination, the explanation near the end on the structure of the Matrix and The One's purpose was a surprisingly smart sci-fi concept in a movie that for the most part was more chopsocky than sci-fi. If you've seen the first one and approach this with low expectations (or, like some of the people at this site, consider all that blather deep) you might enjoy yourself, but if you're expecting a worthy sequel to The Matrix, forget it.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The story continues as Neo ,Trinity and Morpheus, as well as a whole slew of new characters, try to fight the programs of the Matrix. The story builds and more questions are raised. This episode starts a year or so after the first ones finale. Neo has learned quite a few new tricks and he's looking like The One. More people in Zion start to believe in the prophecy. Morpheus gives an inspirational speech to the masses in the Temple of Zion. A new character , Niobe played by Jada Pinkett Smith, adds even more sexiness to this sexy spectacle. As does Monica Beluchis character Persephone. We also meet a character named Seraph who is quite enjoyable. We learn much more about the Matrix and it's origins and so forth. This film tells the tale of the incredible corruptness inside the Matrix program. It is a CGI spectacular. The first film innovated the film making process as did this one. It not only stood up to it's predececor , it went beyond it. There was allot of adding to the plot as well as dialogue , but this films superior quality is what it looks like. It ends in a cliff hanger but don't let that get you down, it's all vindicated in the finale. I would rank this film my third favorite film of all time. If you haven't seen this movie I suggest that you go out right now and rent it or buy it. After you have seen the first one.The Matrix Trilogy is the most fascinating and inspirational story of modern times. This is what film making is about and I hope to see other films follow suit. This is what I live for. To be taken into a different world and inspired by it is something that i enjoy. I can't imagine anyone ever topping this trilogy. I also consider The Matrix as a historical event in that it gave us hope in times of doubt. It shows us the reality of our sins and explores the benefit of faith. If you can't get into the story , watch it just for the spectacle. If you do get into the story, well then , welcome to the desert of the real my friend.","43 out of 83 found this helpful.

While I enjoyed the original film for what it was, a slick sci-fi/action comic book on celluloid, I felt the script was needlessly rhetorical, and attempts at depth and philosophy were instantly floored by one-note performances. That said, it was still a lot of fun with imagery that has become every bit as iconic as more substantial genre staples.Cut four years to Reloaded, and what we have is a totally different style of film. But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Reloaded is every bit as good as its predecessor, neither better nor worse. Still don't expect any 'acting' here, but what we do receive is further exploration and enhancement of the exciting premise the films are based on. Reloaded might be less action and more talk, but the talk is genuinely interesting, and for the first time, The Matrix comes across as being a genuine sci-fi franchise that at least is making a half-decent stab at greatness, as opposed to being the vidkid's wet dream. The action comes in short bursts, but what action it is! The highway chase sequence is brilliance, true edge of seat stuff that even surpasses the first film. What's not so great is the unhealthy fascination with slow-mo shots. It creates a feel of 'yes guys, we know you can do special effects, now GET ON WITH IT'. But the true strength of Reloaded is its perfect fit with the original film.It answers the questions, its philosophy is less rhetorical, and while its characters come across as even weaker than they were in the first film (no mean feat!), the story is too engaging for you to really notice.It isn't a classic, it's just a strong follow up to a strong mainstream popcorn film. With a little less overconfidence, stronger character development and tighter editing it could have been truly great.7/10","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Since the original ""Matrix"" came out a few years ago everyone has imitated its' kenetic action style, which led me to think there's no way they can recapture that fresh and exciting edge again.  But they did.  The Wachowskis have way out done the new ""Star Wars"" films and without a doubt have far surpassed the ""X-Men films.""   At times the dialogue is clunky and the Zion scenes are a little too Star Trek and Buck Rogers, but the action is always astonishing, and the humor is always in the right place...if not too much in the right place...For example Neo uses one of the many Agent Smiths to take down other Agent Smiths sending them all crashing with the sound of falling bowling pins.  A little goofy but fun. The action though, I can't say enough about.  The center chase scene is awesome and the opening cycle scene is....  Okay, no more words, ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" will not disappoint and by the time you reach the cliffhanger ending you're more than ready for a break from this double talking, mind bending adventure.","97 out of 154 found this helpful.

"7","/10","The Matrix Reloaded A Good Sci-Fi Film With Flaws","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2079260/?ref_=tt_urv","tburke85","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19956219/?ref_=tt_urv","11 June 2009","The Matrix Reloaded is a good sci-fi film with flaws from the Wachowski brothers who return to direct this sequel which may not be on part with first one but it still isn't that bad either action wise. The Wachowski brothers show some real talent and skill with Reloaded but more unanswered questions and the lack of screen time given to Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith including some other characters sort of weigh the film down. In this case though fortunately the good outweighs the bad. I'll start off with the good before going into what I think they could've improved to make Reloaded better. The cast are admirable in reprising their roles including Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Anne Moss, and Hugo Weaving whose role in this one seems to be smaller than the original. Reeves still does a decent job as Neo the One who can now fly and begins to question his role to play as a battle between the machines and the rest of the humans in Zion the last city near the Earths core draws closer. Laurence Fishburne is still the perfect Morpheus who believes that Neo can save them from annihilation. I did feel as though he was more involved in the action in the first one than his character was in this sequel besides an occasional action/fight sequence, Fisburne still makes the best of his role in the movie. Carrie Anne Moss is believable enough as Trinity who's now in love with Neo and believes that he can save them from the machines. Moss like Fishburne gets several action/fight sequences that are impressive but her role doesn't seem as big as it was in the other one either. The same can go Hugo Weaving who definitely makes for an imposing villain as Smith the now renegade program who can make copies of himself. Weaving isn't it that much except for a couple fight sequences and most of his scenes are with well himself but none the less he still does a great job with his villain role. The rest of the supporting cast including Jada Pinkett Smith, Gloria Foster, Monica Belluci, and Lambert Wilson are admirable in their roles but none of them get much screen time. They show up for brief extended cameo appearances and thats about it. The same can go for some of the new supporting villains in this one who at the most make brief cameo appearances before being written out so none of them really leave an impression. Two of the new villains are known only as the Twins who besides one extended action/fight sequence aren't developed at all considering they show up very late into the movie only to written out rather quickly like the other new agents introduced. The two actors who played the Twins though still did a solid job with their brief roles in the film. The special effects are still amazing and state of the art. The action/fight sequences are equally impressive the ones standing out being the incredible highway chase and the fierce fight in which Neo takes on not one but around 100 Agent Smith's at once. The pacing was once again a little slow at times and the sex scene between Neo and Trinity didn't feel necessary. The movie also answered some questions but raises more that are never revealed which is sort of disappointing. The music once again is done very well by Don Davis and fits the tone of the film. The ending leaves off with a cliffhanger but it's not as surprising as it could have been. Overall though despite its flaws Reloaded is still an entertaining sequel that maybe flawed but there's plenty of action, great special effects, some suspense, and impressive performances by most of the cast that make it worth seeing at least once.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

So you were bored.  Why?  Because nothing was exploding for 20 minutes in a row?  What kind of dull human being are YOU?Characters discuss philosophy, the meaning of reality and the meaning of control.  We see Zion for the first time, we see that Morpheus is not only a captain, but a preacher and a lover as well.  Audiences are invited to debate, discuss and revel in these things after movies end, and not only that, but the fate of other characters, and how they got to be in that state.A good discussion, you may find, is what really helps your appreciation for a movie open up, as you yell at your friends and they yell at you over what the extremely well-educated Wachowski Brothers labored to produce, and make you think about.But if you're the kind of slothful soul who likes to stare at a movie and watch things explode for two hours... don't clutter my IMDB because you hate it when characters ""talk.""

I have read reviews that talk about so many religious meanings to this film, but I have not read anywhere that it is actually based on any philosophical/biblical myths. I guess that is open to interpretation as the Wachowski duo excluded themselves from interviews and talking of the films, leaving the films to speak for itself.The action was all very well done again but at the same time felt pretty prolonged. For example Neo fights Agent Smith and the fight goes on and on and on. I really do not think it needed to be that long. Plus it was very video game like and that showed in the animation sequences of the action. The visual effects help it a lot as the whole film has this kind of virtual look and thus the animation stuff does not look so obvious.I am giving this film a pretty moderate rate, as I did not like some of the elements incorporated into this, especially that of the white patriarchal society. Basically, once you learn about how to see the underlying ideology in film, it is hard to find a film that does not conform to this ideology. Here are just some factors: A white man with all the power saves them, the female is asked to step out, the female needs saving, at the head of all this is a white man and so on. It is good that they have a lot of other ethnicities included in the film but their roles are very stereotypical; the Hispanic is a fortune teller, the Chinese are fighters or the brains and ultimately the white men are always the ones in charge.So as much as this film is enjoyable, and this series very intriguing, it has fallen from its initial attraction for me.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was followed by two sequels, neither of them being absolute travesties but at the same time neither are close to the same level.Under review is its first sequel 'The Matrix Reloaded'. A film with some great merits that come close to matching how 'The Matrix' executed the same merits. It also suffers from some major flaws, that make it both disappointing and frustrating. Granted the Wachowskis had a mammoth task to follow and it was such a high standard to compete with, so it was always going to be touch and go as to how it was going to come off.Starting with its good things, once again while not revolutionary 'The Matrix Reloaded' looks wonderful. The production design is still audacious, the special effects dazzling and uber-cool, very slick editing and cinematography that's both clever and imaginative. Once again the music score is hypnotic and haunting, the use of sound having a real sense of eeriness.'The Matrix Reloaded' benefits from some astonishing set pieces, that benefit from looking great, breathless stunts, a great sense of paranoia, energy and tension and, while rather underused, the villains are interesting.Acting varies with Keanu Reeves still oozing super-coolness, Carrie Anne Moss bringing strength and vulnerability and Hugo Weaving a commanding presence. As charismatic as Laurence Fishburne is he does take it too seriously here with too much of a heavy approach.Which is a general problem with 'The Matrix Reloaded' in feeling too heavy and the tone being too serious. It also feels bloated, trying to do too much and also incorporating too many themes and characters, some being not that interesting.Its writing is messy as well, with so much of the dialogue being cheesy and stilted. The pace surprisingly plods, especially at the beginning that feels endless with scenes that serve little to no point or drag badly, and the finale is convoluted.In summary, not an awful film but for a reload/sequel it's vastly inferior, even for expectations being so mixed. 5/10 Bethany Cox","35 out of 59 found this helpful.

"","","A film about intimacy, choice, and purpose","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704651/?ref_=tt_urv","howard.schumann","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0491610/?ref_=tt_urv","2 June 2003","It is six months later. Neo and the rebel leaders have 72 hours until 250,000 machine probes discover Zion and attempt to destroy it. The Matrix Reloaded, the long-awaited sequel to the 1999 blockbuster hit The Matrix, follows the lives and destinies of the freedom fighters from Zion and continues its inquiry into our reason for being. The original had us look at the nature of the reality we live in and the sequel invites us to look at how we respond once we understand that reality. Most of the same characters are back: Neo (Keanu Reeves) as the prophesied One, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) as the enlightened rebel leader, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) as Neo's lover, and the late Gloria Foster as the Oracle, a very wise lady who tells it like it is.As the film opens, the Zionists (sic) prepare to fend off the attack of the sentinels. Morpheus is convinced Neo can save Zion, but to do so he must fend off all enemies to find the source of the Matrix. While Neo is having nightmares about Trinity's ultimate fate, Morpheus defends his decision to remove the Nebuchadnezzar from the first line of defense and shows renewed interest in his ex-lover, Captain Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith). In the meantime, we get our first glimpse of Zion where the main floor with its rusted iron walkways and power generators looks like the remodeled boiler room of the Titanic. After listening to an inspiring speech by Morpheus, the entire floor erupts into a sensuous dance sequence to techno music, interspersed with scenes of Neo and Trinity making love. Neo learns that he must find the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim) who alone can provide him with entry to the mysterious source that controls the Matrix. Neo tracks him down but first has to get past a seductive Monica Belluci and a witty Frenchman named Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) who seduces his women with chocolate cake. As would be expected for a film with a budget that rivals the US Treasury, the special effects are outstanding and several action sequences stand out. The first uses digital effects and the choreography of Hong Kong director Yuen Wo Ping to recreate 100 clones of Agent Smith in a fight sequence with Neo. The longest and most bizarre sequence is a 15-minute freeway chase involving hundreds of cars, a Ducati motorcycle, trailer trucks, and agents all over the place. The scene, that included a specially built stretch of highway costing $1 million, took three months to film and is estimated to have cost $38 million. Don Davis choreographs the car chases with a techno score that becomes irritating after about the second explosion.
The Wachowski's have been accused of ""heavy handed moralizing"", ""a for Dummies primer on philosophy"", and ""empty-headed techno-babble"" but I think very few critics are listening to what they are actually saying. The film is about intimacy, choice, purpose, and our place in the universe. It suggests that ""everything starts with choice"" and ""the only truth is causality"". Put another way, we are the ""chooser"", the author and the cause of our own experiences. When we choose, we are really choosing what has already been chosen. `You are not here to make a choice,' the Oracle tells Neo `You have already made it. You're here to find out why'. What this means to me is that we are all here for a purpose of our own choosing and our job is to discover the appropriate means to realize that purpose. Believe me, you do not learn this in Philosophy 101.Like the original, many elements of The Matrix Reloaded are fun and appeal to a younger audience but I found the sequel to be somewhat disappointing. The original left major aspects of the puzzle to our imagination and did not overload us with special effects. The sequel is more complex but lacks the sense of wonder of the first film. We know enough not to take the car chases and fight sequences too seriously, but without the element of danger, the highly choreographed set pieces become pointless and irritating. At the end of the first film, Neo told his adversaries on the phone, ""I'm going to hang up this phone, and then show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules or controls, borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible.'

It is because in the first one, i thought there would be more matrix and less the sci-fi stuff, which i did not like as much. This movie has a lot of matrix. It also has better and more action scenes in my opinion. I simply enjoy the action scenes more than the think really hard scenes. This movie gave me what i wanted, which was more stuff inside the matrix and more action scenes, and that i got. Yes, there is that weird scene with the french guy and the orgasm, but i can forgive that, because after that there is like a half an hour chase scene, which ends so epicly. 
The cgi which a lot of people say is really bad, i thought it is fine and i did not really mind it. It did not bother me.
So i enjoyed it more, because it was just more fun, morea action and more matrix :)","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

All the rules are broken, and we're given a glimpse of all the possibilities of this world with no rules. That moment of realization is expanded throughout all of Reloaded, and we're given so much more than just a glimpse. If The Matrix is about paranoia, than The Matrix Reloaded is certainly about discovery. I definitely liked the first better, but I really appreciate how this one takes everything further and stays 10 steps ahead of the audience. Remember when the original first came out and everyone said how confusing the plot was at first? Looking back now, that plot was simple compared to this one. You have to watch Reloaded a couple of times to really get a hold of everything.Along with the advanced plot, the special effects are advanced, too. There are some great fight scenes, and of course the infamous freeway chase sequence. In between all the action there is a lot of talk. Mostly about very confusing paradoxal stuff. You start to wonder if Stephen Hawking had a hand in writing the script. But I really liked those parts. No movie has really asked all of these questions and created such a unique world to ask them in. Those were the parts that got people to watch the movie again.The only parts that I can actually say bored me were all the scenes taking place on Zion. That's where a lot of the film's weak points take place, such as Morpheus' cheesy speech. Sure, it was probably intentionally cheesy (that seems like just the kind of character Morpheus is), and I didn't hate or resent the Zion scenes, I just wish they were shorter. Around those points I usually hit the fast-forward button. I was most interested by the scenes inside the Matrix.I really liked this movie overall. I was hesitant to see it at first since I loved the original so much, and I thought the commercials for Reloaded looked pretty stupid, but I took a chance and I really enjoyed it. I can't wait to see Revolutions.My rating: 7.5/10","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I wasn't mature enough to appreciate Harrison Ford's space-cowboy smirk or Carrie Fischer's sarcasm, much less the swagger of their respective deliveries. All I cared about was robots blasting other robots.By the time The Matrix hit theaters in 1999, we had seen enough action-packed sci-fi over the years to make us cringe. Our demands had increased exponentially.We now expect both a story as well as the actors' performance to retain some amount of integrity. If this is missing, no amount of kicking or shooting can rid us of the feeling that we've just been wasting our time in a way that was only acceptable when we were 11.In light of all the negative reviews on Reloaded, I tried not to expect too much. Still, I paid a whopping $9.00 at the box-office of a top-notch theater equipped with the beefiest sound system in town. During and after, I felt embarrassed for having done so.I was given the distinct impression that Andy and Larry themselves had never even seen The Matrix.Reloaded is an entirely different film from The Matrix. It reeks of a sell-out, of board rooms filled with brainstorming marketing-scammers, of a colossal rip-off that seems to have forgotten what Generation X liked most about The Matrix: its atmospheric flair.In The Matrix, we're taken on a post-modern coming-of-age journey with Neo. In Reloaded, it's not Neo, but CGI that's the focus of the film.Reloaded is nothing more than a full-length feature COMPUTER GAME. So why not just go play one?The Matrix was a slick and suspenseful FILM, in which the viewer identified with the underdogs' characters. We rejoiced when they overcame. But Reloaded lacks any treatment of the protagonist's development, or anyone else's for that matter, allowing the viewer to identify with the plight of no-one.The Matrix closed out with a pounding tune by Rage Against the Machine, who scream ""Fist in the air in the land of hypocrisy!!!"" So what happened to this perspective?It's Invasion of the Body Snatchers: The original writers were replaced by 14-year-old computer geeks more eager to escape into the arms of a voluptuous, blonde computer program than they are in making a film.Reloaded is so pristinely sterile, odorless, emotionless, CHARACTER-less, and at times so pubescently vulgar, it's hard to believe these are the same writers.This affects even the best of actors. It's disheartening to see the Othello of The Matrix reverse roles with Keanu in respect of acting quality.Fishburne's droning recital of horrific, pseudo-intellectual musing is so stilted, you can almost hear the director urging him to be ""More serious, Laurence! You've got to be more Morpheus than Morpheus himself ever knew he was!""Further criticisms include:---Actions sequences too clean (i.e. retouched) and drawn-out. Suspense is lost;---CGI used far too often to smooth over gaps in bullet-time photography. The least trained eye easily spots Gumby-like cartoon drawings stretching across the screen;---Acting and writing brutally stilted. Offends the most ill-equipped intellect. One has the impulse to ignore the dialog completely as a means of punishing it, like parents deliberately not reacting to a 10-year old who tries to shock them with foul language. Misguided attempts at 10th-grade level pop-philosophy add to superficiality;---The direction the story takes views like a made-for-TV Stargate spin-off with an all-new no-name cast. Story and characters are hideously compromised, amateurishly convoluted;---Nothing short of fury is generated by what sloppy writing did to Agent Smith (now a renegade evil hippie-bot on a soul-search, seeking revenge for reasons frighteningly lacking depth) and the Oracle (now trivialized by meandering, contrived oracle-speak, reduced to a pseudo-smarmy program, a side-act as opposed to the pithy element she was). These two key characters are robbed of their sovereignty and depth;---Sets in Zion are too Hollywood, mat-drawing or CGI. Costumes are straight out of Star Trek the Next Generation or a Calvin Klein commercial for Woodstock-copycat wannabe ravers. This contrasts harshly with underdog Matrix-hackers all wearing moth-eaten sweaters on the Nebuchadnezzar vis-a-vis Zion mission control's immaculate, glaring white, state-of-the-art hi-tech garb. Overload of scenes with superfluous counsels and commanders who all have something TERRIBLY important to say;---Twins are pubescently extravagant disco-albino Casper-the-Ghost punching bags. The freeway chase scene is among the most drawn-out sequences; leaves one addled, apathetic;---We anticipated seeing ""the minds Neo freed"" and how Neo does this more than anything, far more than him rescuing himself and his pals. The writers completely ignore this.In sum:This movie has nothing to do with the original, where it left off, or its 'message'.We overestimated the Wachowski Bros. when we hoped they would present a follow-up that would hold true to 'what it means' to be an underdog, hack a Matrix or rage against a machine.The Bros. need to rewind to scenes where Carrie-Anne Moss delivers lines from the back seat of a suicide-door Caddy in the rain: 'You've been down that road Neo...', or Laurence Fishburne's 'I suspect that right about now you're feeling a bit like Alice ... tumbling down the rabbit hole'. The feeling scenes like those evoked is long lost. Instead, the Bros. just reload and regurgitate on us, CGI-style.Talents of accomplished actors are squandered. The actors themselves come across brow-beaten by lousy script-writing until performances are all less than equal to Keanu's robotics.Between 1999 and 2003, the Bros. seem to have forgotten what it means to rock like underdogs.Maybe it's because the dollar signs on their eyes have blinded them. Reloaded not only abandons its own previously postulated truth ... that ""there is no spoon"" ... it now INSISTS there is one, and promptly proceeds to ram it down our throats.","163 out of 314 found this helpful.

The visual effects, fight scenes, action sequences etc. were superb, and indeed far beyond those of the first movie. What was sorely lacking though was that sense of wonder and amazement there was in the first movie as the viewer journeyed with neo in discovering just what the matrix is and and just what the task was at hand. Also, I felt that the dialogue fell flat in many areas, and that was on of the strengths of the original as well. When I learned that sequels were being made, I wondered how they were going to manage to keep the excitement with neo being something equivalent to superman. Sadly, I was right in surmising that it would just be a special effects spectacular devoid of the surrealism and sense of mystery that made the first one a classic. Rather, this movie was just a ludicrous amalgamation of cool powers and hokey plot conveniences which just didn't satisfy the viewer as completely as the original matrix. Overall though, it was still a very entertaining movie, and I would not say don't see it, but also, don't go in with expectations soaring as I did. True Matrix fans will be disappointed as the producers sold the soul and passion of the original for a cheesy action spectacular reminiscent of ""the one"" with jet li.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Neo (Keanu Reeves), Morpheus (a fat Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie Ann-Moss), together with the operator Link (Harold Perrneau Jr.) get the Nabucodonosor and go to the Matrix, trying to save the last sanctuary of human race. Neo meets the Oracle (Gloria Foster) trying to get information about the matrix and how to save Trinity from her fate exposed in his dream. In the matrix, Neo fight against an upgraded version of Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and the Twins and become aware of further details of the matrix. `The Matrix' is a fantastic and stunning movie, where an original plot was supported by great special effects. Perhaps together with `Blade Runner' are the best science fiction movies ever made. Although not being a bad movie, this sequel was a great disappointment for me. The originality of `The Matrix' is gone and it becomes indeed a great action movie, with lots of state of art effects. But the plot is very complicated and has some foolish parts, like, for example, the (long) rave party in Zion while Neo and Trinity make love. Neo flying like Superman looks ridiculous for me. Further, why fight against dozens of Agent Smith, if he could escape flying? The outfit of Neo looks like the clothes of a priest. The story is also very confused and sometimes the viewer needs to re-watch the scene or sequence to get a better comprehension. However, there are lots of action and special effects and entertains. My vote is eight.","11 out of 20 found this helpful.

As difficult as it is to watch and understand these films its almost unfathomable to think up a story like this. The story continues with Neo (Keanu Reeves), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburn) as they try and figure out how the machines can be stopped from invading their world and they suspect that there is a leak somewhere. The shots of the human world reminded me of some of the sets in the ""Lord of the Rings"" films. Big and cavernous and some of the shots inside the homes looked like it may have been shot on a large ship. Actor Anthony Zerbe plays Councillor Hamann and Gloria Foster is the Oracle. They are the ones that give the okay to infiltrate the other side and try and locate the ""Keymaster"" who is suppose to have a key that can unlock a special door. Their are some lapses in the film where nothing happens and some have complained about them. But what are you going to do? Complain that the makers of the film were trying to move the story along without action? You can't have action every minute. The action scenes are spectacular though. At times they become almost breathtaking and technically they are some of the best ever put on film. I also felt that they were just put in for eye candy and had little to do with the story. The battle between Neo and the 100 agent Smith's seemed pointless although it was fun to watch! Reeves seems to have even less lines to speak in this one than the first. He just stands around when not kicking ass. The character of Trinity played by Moss is the one that seems to have been expanded. You can make a good point that she steals the film. Film has no real ending and it just sets itself up for the third installment that comes out this fall. I felt some mixed emotions when I was done watching this and while technically its probably more impressive than the first film I felt Reeves character of Neo seemed under used. Also, what was that messy dance all the people were doing in the first part of the film? Can't they wear shoes? Story structure seemed a little off but this is still a very entertaining film to watch. Visually stimulating and some truly memorable action scenes make this a fun viewing experience. For you trivia buffs out there, at one point in the film a police radio utters the phrase ""One Adam-12"".

"","","The Matrix: Deflated!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704713/?ref_=tt_urv","uds3","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1318549/?ref_=tt_urv","30 May 2003","The Wachowskis, having bitten off more than they can digitise in this, the second ""coming"" of so many computer nerd's wet dreams, have over-stepped their dubious talent here - obviously victims of their own hype! THIS is the computer game - THE MATRIX was the movie!To be expected, the flick has its die-hard adherents who would happily take a lie-detector test to convince us that they alone can penetrate the bulldust and fathom a master-plan in progress. This armored, but essentially - cranially displaced movie, is, like the sum of Morpheus' spoutings, heavy on pretense, light on significance. Fishburne's Moses-inspired ""address to the nation"" atop Pride Rock, must rank as the most non-sensical piece of dialog ever uttered in a movie. Even HE looks utterly embarrassed to be there, frequently pausing as if wondering ""WHAT did I just say?"" The entire sequence in fact, including the orgiastic rave with a BLADE soundtrack, appears to have been inspired by THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.As for THAT completely loopy and sex-less coupling with Carrie Ann Moss, I had to avert my eyes for fear of being rendered sterile! (Talk about LOT's wife!) C'mon....the woman looks old enough to be Reeve's mother and unintentionally cruel though it is, has any love interest ever been less attractive in the history of cinema? Reeves MUST have been wearing shades to do it! (Footnote to Miss Moss: No insult intended Carrie, I'm no better - way past my own use-by date but hey, LOVED the catwoman outfit!)
Reeves in fact appears majorly stilted and wooden throughout proceedings here (yeah, I know that IS par for the course for dear old Keanu, but Hell, couldn't NEO (gosh thats brilliant - anagram of ONE,  Thank you HAL!) have had just a little fun? As for his excruciatingly prolonged brawl with the replicated Agent Smiths....what the HELL was that?.....realistic? meaningful? intellectual? spiritual? None of the above, this was pretentious, laughable, overlong and irritating. Did LESS than nothing for the flick's credibility. One may also well ask, why, with his ability to leap tall buildings and fly at warp factor 10, would he even be bothered with such mundane fisticuffs in the first place? If he can repel bullets and the considerably better equipped aliens simply by holding his hand up, whats the deal here with the army of Weavings?  The sequence of course was not intended for logical contemplation. simply to impart to the popcorn-munching cretins that ""hey, ain't this one FUN movie?""Quantum physics, Crane-crap, Zen Buddhism, Armani fashions, Cecil B De Mille, Fritz Lang and Jacke Chan aside, what are we LEFT with here?  A half-decent freeway chase and ONLY the second other intelligent part of the movie - the sequence with the architect. The latter being the greatest, most perceptive and well delivered flurry of meaningful adjectival literacy since Lord Henry gave Dorian a lesson in societal objectivity in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. I cannot believe that greater than 2% of the MATRIX RELOADED's entire audience worldwide would have had the slightest idea of what was being said!The less said about the ending (and I use the term loosely), the better. You want thought provoking Sci-fi? stick with 2001 or BLADE RUNNER. You want action?  MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR leaves this for dead and WITHOUT CGI. You want superb characterisation? try BILLY BUDD on for size. Maybe gothic brilliance is your thing? THE INNOCENTS awaits you! You wanna be swept along with the crowd?  better catch MATRIX RELOADED (actually a sequel to THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES) before you actually get a chance to think!","38 out of 84 found this helpful.

There's an incredible amount of what can only be called overload here - too much extemporizing, too much pop philosophy, and too much bloat. But the action here really is too much - in the best way possible - and that saves this movie. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" begins with an overwrought and over-philosophized first act, mostly set in the ""real world."" We see the last human city, Zion, which is a giant cave set deep within the Earth. In retrospect, I suppose the over-the-top action sequences set in the Matrix, and the whole sequence with the Merovingian are just as bloated as the tedious first act, which is set in the ""real world"" of Zion. However, there's a critical difference: the Matrix is a cool place to be, and the ""real world"" looks a one-way trip to chronic depression. All this made me wonder why the humans were at war to save Zion from the machines who control the Matrix. Wouldn't it make more sense for them to defeat the machines, take over the Matrix, and plug everyone back in so they can stop living the Soylent Green lifestyle of Zion and start living the good life? Still, with all the brilliant, groundbreaking action any movie fan could want, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is ultimately a rewarding film.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I know it can be difficult for a movie to beat it's predecessor, especially if the original is invigorating and awesome while being a visual feast with substance. The main problem with this one is that it lacks a lot of substance and to make up for that it has a lot of cool action scenes. Now the actions sequences is really cool and because of that this movie is worth watching. The music in this fits the premise of the movie and mixes well with the action to the point it can get addicting to listen to. If it pulled some surprises or unexpected elements it might have added to the value of this movie but that isn't the case The philosophical elements isn't intriguing or engaging to listen to but seemed forced at times. In fact when there is no action on screen the movie becomes very lame to watch. Especially the when it comes to the part revolving Zion. Overall this is a cool action oriented movie that lacks the substance that the first one has. But if you want to see some really cool action sequences with some cool music, you will probably be entertained to some degree with this one.6.7/10","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","Fine second chapter to the Matrix series, in some ways better that the first.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0705446/?ref_=tt_urv","TxMike","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0438066/?ref_=tt_urv","15 January 2004","'In some ways better than the first.'  The problem with 2nd and further installments is the novelty is gone, and 'novelty' counts for a lot in this type of Sci-Fi movie. The original Matrix introduced us to that unique world, the travel between the real world and the matrix, the idea of Neo being a savior of sorts, the inventive photography, like 'bullet time', that has influenced a whole generation of movies and TV commercials. So, in 'The Matrix - Reloaded' we don't have to benefit of discovering all those things, instead we see the deeper development of the story, and a fine story it is.
My only real complaint is that some of the fight scenes went on for too long. While I enjoyed them, after a short time they essentially keep repeating and I wanted for the story to move forward. But that is a relatively minor complaint for what as a whole is a superb movie. However, I rate the first installment above it, for the reasons I state at the beginning of my review. Much as the first 'Back To The Future' and the first 'Indiana Jones' movies were the best of their series.I own the DVD, and will buy the DVD of the 3rd installment, even though it has received some harsh criticism from some quarters. The Matrix movies have influenced , and will continue to influence, many movies made after them. I would not want to be without the complete set. As we have come to expect, the picture and surround track are first-rate, always a pleasure to watch and listen to.","28 out of 63 found this helpful.

As with all major summer blockbusters, if a sequel was talked about, the anticipation was high and it was no different here. Matrix Reloaded would be the follow up to the monster success and was released in 2003. The film was directed by the Wachowskis and stars Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie Ann Moss, Hugo Weaving, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Gloria Foster. The film would prove to be a huge financial success and was at the time, the highest grossing R-rated movie (until Deadpool). Critically, the film received generally positive reviews but nowhere near what the first film received and that is still the case to this day.With the danger of an army of 250,000 Sentinels coming to destroy the remaining human population, it is up to Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity to delve deeper into the Matrix and help save the remaining human population.Within the first few minutes of this film, the film makes itself fairly clear on what type of film it is going to be. A balls to the wall action film and this film does that spectacularly. I found the first film's action to be somewhat lacking. Still good, but it was the action in this film that I was really wanting to see. Every fight scene from the martial arts to the guns blazing fight scenes were loads of fun to watch and, dare I say, better than a lot of what we get in the original film. Granted, the CGI, when used, is not great and looks a bit cartoonish with the CGI people. But I was never too bothered by it. I found it to be fairly common for this type of CGI to be used in the early 2000's (with films like 2002's Spiderman and such). But, this film wanted to go balls to the wall and they managed to do that with what the technology was capable of doing at the time. There is a wide variety of action in this film. One could argue that the original film was a good way of ending the story and they would be right. But knowing more about the Matrix and Zion is nice too and the film for the most part gives us all that. Zion was only mentioned in the first film and I feel that in this film, knowing what Zion looks like and how it functions as the last human civilization is far more rewarding. We know more about the Matrix and with all great mysteries, when it comes to adding more and more details, it will make people a bit mad because everyone has their own idea of what the solutions to these mysteries are. These new details are largely left unexplained or would later be explained in Matrix Revolutions. The first film was heavy into the philosophical dialogue and that is fine and it works well for the first film. It could be argued that the first film handled all of the philosophical mumbo jumbo best because it was the first film and came unexpected and got people thinking. By default, this film's philosophical dialogue is not nearly as good but there is less of it. With the first film, you kind of have to be in the right mindset to be able to be held captive by the dialogue. With this film, you have the action which is something the mainstream audience could get behind and therefore, could get the mainstream behind the philosophical dialogue. The acting is fairly good. In other words, same quality of acting seen in the first film.I think Matrix Reloaded is a different type of film, it is more action oriented and with that being said, does a superb job at that. It really can be a toss up whether you want the more philosophical film or the more action oriented film. But largely, this film has the minor flaws of the original film. Overall, a good popcorn flick that is loads of fun.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

We were taught that the world we know does not in fact exist, and that it is a simulation of the late 20th century universe. In reality, it is actually sometime in the 2200's, and machines have taken over mankind, hacking all humans into a parallel universe called The Matrix, to prevent them from resisting and making them believe in a false reality. However, a prophecy speaks of one man (Neo, an icon character, portrayed by Keanu Reeves) who will free humans from the Matrix. That film also introduced us to Neo's arch-nemesis, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), a menacing villain who is sent by the machines to stop Neo inside The Matrix, but eventually goes rogue after Neo overcome him.Naturally, with such a set up, the world was uptight so see what will come next in the Matrix universe. The first installment left viewers anticipating (and not always satisfied), and the box office success of that film led up to The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolution (parts 2 and 3 of the sci-fi trilogy) being filmed back to back en route to their hyped up release back in 2003. The results, however, were a mixed bag with audiences. While Reloaded was a box office smash with over 280 million dollars of receipts on the domestic side alone, Revolutions, which was released later that year earned less than half than that. People claimed Reloaded was too contrived for its own good, and that Revolution's final conclusion was a far cry from what they have expected. Personally speaking, I had a blast watching both sequels, and think that the original film just set a bar that was way too high for any film to stand up to. I, for one, was happy with what I got.The Matrix Reloaded tells us about an upcoming attack of the machines on Zion, the last human pocket of resistance. Neo must ultimately find the architect, the computer program that is responsible for The Matrix, in an attempt to prevent this attack. Meanwhile, he is haunted by visions of a dark faith awaiting his beloved Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) and is encouraged by Morpheus (Larry Fishburne) to live up to the prophecy. During his mission, Neo encounters a new revelation that might shake the foundations of the Matrix before the humans do: computer programs who feel emotion, be it hatred by Mr. Smith or lust by Persephone. The movie was received with much doubts by fans and critics, as it is a more spiritual and philosophical journey than its predecessor. While many thought the questions aroused regarding freedom of choice and freedom of will were mainly boring and pretentious, I found the whole discussion thought provoking, and an admirable addition to the intelligent nature of the series. I also don't understand the yakking about lack of action  the car chase sequence with the twins and the multiple-Smith battle sequence were some of the best action scenes yet to grace the screen.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I know it spurred much-imitated style and effects that are not only implemented in other movies that followed but also parodied in comedies. But consider the other elements: premise isn't so revolutionary (as Roger Ebert points out in his 1999 review, the concept is very similar to that of Dark City and Strange Days), storyline follows the quest-of-the-Christ-figure archetype that's been around throughout history, and the climax comes down to the conventional bout between the hero and his nemesis.  Fun, but ordinary nevertheless. The Matrix Reloaded takes leaps and bounds in its ingenuity.  Action is fiercer and more entertaining (from the thrills of the freeway chase to the sheer fun of watching Neo beat up on 200 copies of Agent Smith with a steel pole), plot thickens in truly revolutionary ways that leaves you both enlightened and dumbfounded, and the climax of the movie isn't some tired old fight sequence but a philosophical discussion and discovery of what the One truly is (or is it really true?). In the end, the movie leaves more questions than it answers, and that is precisely what the part two of a trilogy is supposed to do.  It hits at all facets and levels, and turns the Matrix triology, which seemed to be a more or less conventional trilogy, into a truly novel story of a scale grander than you could have imagined after seeing on the first Matrix.  This is the best ""part two"" flick in a trilogy since Empire Strikes Back.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Unlike most comic book movies, you don't have to take the amazing stunts with an unbelievable pill because they are done in the constructs of a computer program where these characters are merely reprogramming the rules.  That concept was cool even if it was ripped off from any Cyberpunk novel/story ever written.  (Does anyone else think it is funny that Keanu was in Johnny Mnemonic?)The bad thing is that I am already having the exact opposite reaction to Reloaded.  I watched it and kept thinking ""WOW, COOL!"" but in retrospect, some of the CGI was obvious in stunts, there is too much of a reliance on a 'deus ex machina' resolution to events, and I kept expecting the Stay Pufft Marshmallow Man to appear every time they talked about the Key Maker.  In the end, I felt Reloaded set up Revolutions to be a bomb.  The Wachowskis and Silver are adding layers to the Matrix itself but are making it so cumbersome that you just want to say that there has to be reality at some level, but you never find it.Several continuity errors between films jumped out at me, but I'll let you discover them for yourselves.  All in all, it was a slightly above average sci-fi action flick that I'm afraid will become cliched to the point that one day we'll be seeing this on MST5K or whatever incarnation of that show may still be around in 20 years.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

And was I the only one saying to myself, at the end of each action fight, ""now why didn't he do that (fly away, etc) in the first place?""

Matrix Reloaded came to us with very heavy expectations on its shoulders and with a heavy heart I have to admit it does not deliver. Worse still, it started to make me think again about the original Matrix - was that film actually that great? Matrix Reloaded suffers from the same problem as Blade 2, there is frankly too much CGI in the film and some scenes seem to drag on for ages (Neo meeting the Architect -  zzzzzzzzzzz). True, the car chase sequence is astounding and that does make Reloaded worth seeing but the fight sequences seem dull and flat and frankly at the end of the film you wished that they had died and that Julia Roberts and Kermit the Frog would star in Matrix 3.
However, if you do go and see it in the cinema, please don't laugh at the people who come in their leather coats thinking they look like Neo. They need help. They don't look cool, they just look a bit sweaty and smelly. An apt description of Reloaded, it simply tries to hard and it somehow missed the point.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It not only ends with the magic and promising 'To Be Continued', but it also leaves many of the characters as well as the action suspended in waiting for the final. However, it does take a full ticket price to see it, it's a business after all, and a rewarding one it seems. Thus, the comments are also for the full price we pay and in my opinion, it is an unfinished business. 7/10 on my personal scale, largely a disappointment relative to the original.The Big thing in 'Reloaded' are the effects. Though it does not provide anything similar with the genius vision of the Matrix of humans connected to provide energy for the machines - one of the greatest visual images of the seventh art from the original - it has a huge amount of special effects of memorable creativity and force.  Nothing really new concerning the Matrix. After the positive shock of the original idea, it looks like the authors have not much new to say, and the action is not much better than classical science fiction - humanity fighting machines or aliens - it really does not matter. It's good stuff, but not genial as expected (sorry guys, you are the ones who created the great expectations). Worse, a lot of pseudo-religious, pseudo-Shakespeare talk makes the film too heavy, and even sometimes boring. Overall, good entertainment, but not much more. Let us wait for the third film, and expect that we will be rewarded. I am ready to apologize to the 'Matrix'.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

"7","/10","An enjoyable film that you may or may not find annoying and unnecessary","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2268706/?ref_=tt_urv","boiled_elephant","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4220737/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2010","I'm not going to bother recounting the plot direction of The Matrix Reloaded. There are two reasons for this: first, it's up there in the 'plot' section, and second, it's actually not relevant to whether or not you like (or will like) this film. Allow me to explain.Watched on its own merit, Reloaded isn't terrible; I dare say it's quite good. It even has little glimmers of genuine brilliance. The extraordinary backlash against it was less because of its actual content and more because of its existence at all: The Matrix was such a standalone unit in everybody's mind that any sequel could only have felt like a clunky shift from single film to serialisation. I tested my own intuitions on this by asking myself what would have constituted a good, non-disappointing sequel to The Matrix and realised that nothing would have met the mark. We were always going to feel that one of our modern classics had been violated to some degree.There's much that's good about Reloaded, not least the exposition and development of the inner workings of the Matrix and AI. Smith's character gets a working over and becomes, if possible, even more interesting: the unsettling discrepancy between him and the other agents and his relentless, unfathomable-even-to-him desire for freedom from his own system and nature, are picked up from the first film and fleshed out, so to speak. There's a much broader cast and much of the supporting acting is excellent: Anthony Zerbe as the head Councillor in Zion stood out for me. His small, quiet scenes escaped my notice entirely at first, because first time round I was impatient to see more relevant things happening, but on repeat viewings they're welcome changes of pace.However, there are teething problems. Tank (Marcus Chong), everybody's favourite operator in The Matrix and a generally fantastic character, has no appearance; his replacement is Link, played by Harold Perinneau, who I'd previously encountered playing Michael in Lost. He annoyed me more in this film than in that series, because whereas Lost shoehorned him into the Angry Black Man stereotype for a long time before giving him some real characterisation Reloaded seems content to ignore his abilities as an actor entirely and use him primarily for comic relief during tenser moments. Someone narrowly escapes death: back in his control room, Link squeals with relief; that sort of thing. It's a matter of personal taste, but I could have handled him being a more serious character.I can only talk about acting for so long before mentioning Keanu Reeves, and it's that time again. Keanu is all over this film. He ramps it up here with love scenes, meditative dialogues (in which the aforementioned Anthony Zerbe, among others, sort of draws attention to Keanu by out-acting him considerably) and a small handful of one-liners. If you have a serious Keanu allergy, you simply won't be able to enjoy this film. Whereas in The Matrix his stiff, quiet style was in-character for the stiff, confused pre-enlightenment Neo, Reloaded has him take centre place as the hero of the film and if you can't stand watching him act then it's probably not worth your time. Personally, he's starting to grow on me.I mentioned love scenes. Romance plays a bigger part in this film, which for my money is a bad thing because it's never really been the Wachowski brothers' forté. The first film had kind of a weird relationship with...relationships, with Neo and Trinity ostensibly falling in love after a few weeks of tense, brief exchanges in cars and between gunfights. Reloaded continues their bizarre, silent courtship. The subplot of their relationship is central to the story, so it pops up again and again, but it never seems to bring the film's better moments: wherever love is concerned, the script seems to take a break, and most of the romantic dialogue feels clunky and forced. You may experience it differently. But just so you're forewarned, you will hear Keanu Reeves utter the phrase, ""I love you too damn much"".On a happier note, there are a ton of new antagonists, all of whom are extremely fun to watch; Morpheus takes a close-to-centre role again, getting a lot of the screen time and doing awesome things with it; and though it probably doesn't need mentioning, the action sequences are a joy to watch. Cars are crashed, lorries explode, bullets fly, doors melt in slow motion, and it's generally action fodder of the highest calibre. The sound effects team went a little overboard, with every slightest movement of a sword being punctuated by a 'shhiinng!' and that bassy bullet-time noise filling roughly half the film - the rest being filled by over-the-top orchestral climaxes - but it's not experience-breaking.Ultimately, though, these are secondary concerns. Your ability to enjoy this film will hinge on whether or not you feel The Matrix *needed* a sequel. The comment I hear most often about Reloaded is that it just didn't need to happen; if that's how you feel about it, you'll probably find Reloaded annoying and disappointing, at least at first, despite the fact that it's really quite good. If that was your experience at the cinema and you haven't watched it since, though, give it another chance.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Trinity dies. Morpheus cries (almost). These are just three of the many scenes of The Wachowski Brothers' ""The Matrix Reloaded"", one of the most anticipated sequels of the last decade.The film begins with Neo, played by Keanu Reeves. Neo is plagued by nightmares involving the death of lover Trinity (Carrie Anne-Moss). He believes he is seeing the near future. After a few neat CGI-filled scenes that show that to us, we find Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) (the latter of whom is being ridiculed by some fellow humans for belief in ""The Prophecy"") on their way home to Zion. There they learn that the amount of sentinels has increased greatly. The war is coming, or so we are told.Morpheus meets with his rival, stern Commander Lock (Harry Lennix). The two are constant competitors after Lock stole Morpheus' love, Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith). They fight about what to do, what's coming, and what to believe.So do we. With ""Reloaded"", what began as a single successful film becomes an updated ""Star Wars""-esquire trilogy, with a seemingly unbeatable first film, a middle piece, and a battle-filled climax. Many watchers will be put off from this film's lack of progression storywise, but that's meant to be. It's the centerpiece for the story, and it's unfortunately quite hard to do much with the centerpiece (""The Empire Strikes Back"" still wows me).What Andy and Larry have done is left open our questions from the first film. Oh yeah, they added some new ones too. And I get the feeling ""Revolutions"" doesn't clear them up either. Ugh.""Reloaded"" is every bit as entertaining as the original film, if not a little more confusing at times. There's enough action and excitement to keep anyone in their seats - especially the scene around the end of the picture, in which Morpheus and Trinity struggle to keep the Keymaker out of reach of The Twins and/or the Agents. And, all of this occurs on what's got to be the most realistically vicious freeway I've ever seen.One thing that I deemed unnecessary was the amount of sexuality. There was a fair amount of sexuality (including nudity) and too much sappiness throughout the film. Carrie Anne-Moss and Keanu Reeves making out? I don't know about you, but that's not my idea of a good time. Generally, things like this occur when the previously careful directors become more comfortable and popular ... which isn't always a bad thing.The CGI animation is spectacular. There's a slight drop in martial arts action from the first film, but the action sequences here are really fun. Of course, they're accompanied by another great punk/metal/rock soundtrack and a fast-paced score from Don Davis.One last note: Neo flies. Yep, he flies. As one of the Nebachudnezzar's crew puts it, ""Uh-oh - he's doin' the Superman thing again."" This happens about three times throughout the film, and while it does have a sort of cheesy and annoying feeling to it, I can't help myself but to find it fun. And funny.Overall, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" comes nowhere near being as good as its predecessor, but it's a fun time at the movies, and definitely a recommended watch. Now for ""Revolutions"".","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The action in this movie was bigger and better--just blew me away!What made the first movie better than this one was the mind blowing discovery that went with it--how the amazing story reveals *What Is The Matrix?* and the *Bullet Time* concept used in shooting and directing the movie. But Matrix Reloaded expanded well on the amazingly realistic computer generated effects and on the story, in a way that was not predictable and that offered answers to questions like how the oracle knows what she knows, programmes in the matrix, the machines, zion and so on. The characters were all very cool, looked good--both in the first movie and this one. Plus the *to be concluded* ending was not cruel, but leaves one speculating on what next. I expect Matrix Revolutions will be one hell of a battle!And speaking of expectations, the people who felt cheated by this movie were actually failed by their expectations, not the film. The merit of the film definitely didn't fail in its quality and excellence and deserves the praise it has-and still is-getting.

It's the most influential science fiction film since at the very least T2, maybe even star wars. It was tightly written, stunning to look at, had revolutionary effects and was just cool as hell - and still is. Like I often state in my reviews, the very best movies, especially of this genre, just don't date like lesser efforts, and the same is true of the Matrix.Onto the sequel then. For me personally, I think this is all but as good as the original. It has a couple of issues, sure - the zion rave, whilst nowhere near as bad as most people make out, is still pretty superfluous. Some of the CGI, whilst really ambitious fell short in 2003 and does so now, particularly the 'burly brawl' and a couple of other bits. For the unprepared, the plot gets fairly complex too and I can see why some people don't like it for this.I actually think it's the sequels greatest strength though. It makes you think and challenges you to make your own interpretation of it. The overtones, wether religious or otherwise, I found to be fascinating, and they're expanded on in interesting ways in this, and I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't like this, surely it's preferable to just repeating the first movie which so many sequels are guilty of.Despite the aforementioned issues with some of the FX, the action scenes still easily match and often surpass the ones in the original though. The freeway chase is absolutely outstanding, a riot of pure chaos, and is in the conversation for the best car chase sequence ever put to film. The staircase fight is a fabulously shot and choreographed ruckus, and is for my money one of, if not the best fight in the trilogy for it's crisp intensity. The score in this scene is excellent too. The aforementioned burly brawl, despite the occasional PS3 effects, is still a whole heap of fun, with Hugo Weaving at his villainous best. There's a ton of other great action scenes here too, this film is still a spectacular blockbuster in every sense of the word. We're even treated to a cliffhanger ending, which is pretty rare even today.All the main players put in solid performances as expected but for me Weaving is the standout, and steals every scene he's in, providing the film's humour on the way too.I absolutely adore this film. Give it another chance.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

My gosh ! The journey in the rabbit hole seems full of crap. Except some excellent actions sequences (Neo with the Smiths, sequence on the highway), this film is filled with terrible and stupid pseudo-philosophical scenes (BORING !) and some combats who looks exactly the same as the first.

It had few instance where it made you think until your brain hurt, and just didn't make sense at times. Once you've seen the whole trilogy couple of times and re-watching this one, you start to appreciate it much more. The Matrix Reloaded has the increase in quality, if it can be said that there actually is one, from the first movie is more the result of an increased budget than anything else. I loved the new movie, but the talent was there in the first one, you can just tell that in the sequel the Wachowski brothers had a virtually endless budget, which allowed them to do pretty much anything they wanted. They have a very distinct style that is clearly evident in all of their movies, even if they are not laden with special effects. The fluidity of the camera movement and the strangely dark tones of their films are only a couple of the techniques that make them recognizable.The story continues as Neo ,Trinity and Morpheus, as well as a whole slew of new characters, try to fight the programs of the Matrix. The story builds and more questions are raised. This episode starts a year or so after the first ones finale. Neo has learned quite a few new tricks and he's looking like The One. More people in Zion start to believe in the prophecy. Morpheus gives an inspirational speech to the masses in the Temple of Zion. A new character , Niobe played by Jada Pinkett Smith, adds even more sexiness to this sexy spectacle. As does Monica Beluchis character Persephone. We also meet a character named Seraph who is quite enjoyable. We learn much more about the Matrix and it's origins and so forth. This film tells the tale of the incredible corruptness inside the Matrix program.The first film innovated the film making process as did this one. It not only stood up to it's predecessor, it went beyond it. There was allot of adding to the plot as well as dialogue. This was a film, where every knew that it was the middle of the story, so it didn't have a clear start or finish and Wachowski brothers knew that and that allowed them to make this film so complex that it distracted some viewers and scared some fans.The whole trilogy needs to be watched together and not apart. It is a very complex film that has a lot of underlying messages.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

That first film is THE ONE to see. ""The Matrix Reloaded"", the first of the inevitable sequels, sucks all the awesome special effects it can muster, and coats the screen with them. The underdeveloped storyline, which helped make the original more mysterious and imaginative, is filled in enough babble to expose it as significantly less than satisfactory. The creative balance of action, effects, and imagination is lost. The three main actors (Reeves, Fishburne, and Moss) are upstaged by ""exciting new allies"". So, what's left? - Although overwrought and onerous, the visual effects are STILL exciting, and the ""Matrix Universe"" isn't damaged beyond repair.

If that is not the case, do not blame me for pointing things out that happened in the first movie that you should be aware of, before watching this. And I don't mean that I will go into details of characters and their fates, but how am I going to write about this, if I am not saying what happened in the end of the first movie? Forget I asked, because there are obviously ways to do so, but I prefer not to.Now having going to lengths to make clear, what this will be about and from what standpoint I am writing, we delve into the story where the first one left us off. Another character is gone and replaced that did survive the first movie (and the issues behind the scenes that occured with Marcus Chong - feel free to google and see what happened there) ... and while the first movie was quite contained, this expands on so many levels. Which obviously has to do with way more money that was being given to the Wachowskis. Since I am writing this in 2021 (barely), I am aware that the formerly brothers are now sisters. Let's call them siblings just in case.Their vision and their taste for blockbuster movies never really changed. Philosophical to a point but really campy too. And quite a few soap opera elements mixed for good measure. Giving characters backstories is good - how they put them on screen ... well there is more than room for discussion on that one.While the first one revolitionized movies with the bullet time ... this has nothing similar to offer. That doesn't mean that the movie doesn't look good. Quite the opposite is the case! The movie looks amazing. In 4k after almost 20 years ... the CGI may have aged, but nothing that bothered me too much.What did bother me when I first watched it way back then ... was the party scene in Zion. Very early on and not really adding anything to the story, this was meant to show off ... well I reckon humanity. And what became of it ... and how they live or try to survive the madness. The scene itself feels like a commercial. It doesn't look bad - not at all, but it feels wrong on so many levels. Even with the speech that Morpheus is giving ... it can't be saved.What also can't be saved is a conversation Neo is having during that party (or was it after it? I just watched it and I forgot ... not that it matters ... although it should considering the ""weight"" of the dialog ... the delivery is quite wooden). Add to that one of the most akward sex scenes ever put to film ... and you may wonder again what the relationship between Neo and Trinity exactly is.And that was just the beginning. There is a lot of philosophical innuendo .. there is a lot of stuff that you can write essays about ... but there a lot of things that you probably will take issue with when you first watch the movie. While it seems like Hugo Weaving is gone as a central villain (and what a performance that was), they seem to have found a loophole to sort of bring him back. Again inner logic and all that. Still the impact is almost lost a bit, especially considering the numbers game ... which also brings us to the agents who seem put in a lesser role here.Do not try to overthink it, so many issues with inner logic, be it ""tests"" to see if Neo is actually Neo through fighting (yes we need an explanation now to see him fight) or new characters and new background for characters we have seen in the first movie (the Oracle, who had to be recasted because the original actress dies unfortunately ... they handled that well story and logic wise, but maybe you feel differently). ... the action is amazing as it was in the first movie and maybe it is the saving grace. With some very interesting action set pieces ... and some interesting actors thrown in for good measure.No one should expec this to match the fist Matrix ... and if you go in with an open mindset, you may actually have quite a lot of fun with this.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's mainly some dull character interactions and the pacing in my opinion.You could've cut out many of the scenes from Zion for instance and have a better movie, since the conflict between the commander and Morpheus or even Link and his wife are forced and you could've get that message across more easily and faster. On a technical point there's some moments in which the CGI isn't well done, which takes you out of the movie for a short time.Now to the great aspects of this movie. The action is great and some nice additions to the original were made. But the movie is strongest in its world it has built and the thought process behind it and what many things symbolize. The idea of a virus entering the matrix being something perfect math can't foresee, the Merovingian's speech about causality, the architect's speech being of pure logic. The representation of the decision between love and duty, of trust and overcoming your fears. Of course you need to be into these kind of philosophical forays.These things elevate this movie to a level, that I can easily forgive its flawed scenes.Overall a great sequel and never understood the exuberant hate towards it.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

This one suffers from several things, noticeably. The first shares traits with the original Star Wars... the main one in this comparison being that they were both the beginning of a trilogy, whilst being fully able to be taken as the entire story. Lucas managed to complete his series of three to the satisfaction of viewers... in part because all had been set up in the initial movie, things didn't get too much more complex and difficult to understand with the following two(don't get me wrong, I find Episodes IV and V to be excellent). The Wachowski brothers did not. This adds layers and facets that the one before it did not... quite possibly simply because it was already so packed, and it still pulled that off. Thus, the attempt here is to successfully integrate these new aspects, as well as top that one. And this entire epic tale was to be closed in less than four and a half combined hours. There was not enough time and the high expectations may not exactly have helped. Where the philosophy was smooth and neither stuck out nor came off as pretentious when this franchise began, it sadly moves in the wrong direction here. Similarly, the dialog just does not reach the same level, and there are downright poor lines herein. Some of the humor does work, other bits come off as being silly. The pacing is not spot-on, but uneven. The plot is good, and develops reasonably. The acting still tends to be in the positive end of the spectrum. The action is still mind-blowing, and it does expand the scope... I do not believe there has ever been anything like the freeway scene before, or that thus far, a similar one has been done. The cinematography is still stunning, and the inspiration and mix still astound. There are memorable sequences, and the choreography and execution for martial arts and shootouts alike are excellent. The music and sound are amazing. Editing is sharp. The effects are incredible. The new cast-members aren't bad at all. To anyone wondering... no, you do not ""need"" to watch The Animatrix, nor play Enter the Matrix. Yes, they tell you more, but one can appreciate and ""get"" all the films without those. What they do is put things in perspective and give more details on certain events and characters, nothing that is required. The ideas and food for thought of this are interesting, it is the presentation that is bothersome. There is moderately strong language, in relatively mild amounts. There is next to no nudity, but sexuality is present once, and very obviously hinted at, as well. This comes with a text introduction(the same one as on the others), by the writer-directors, to the commentary tracks: One with philosophers who enjoyed these, Dr. Cornel West & Ken Wilder, and one of critics who didn't care for them, Todd McCarthy, John Powers & David Thompson. They are worth listening to. The double DVD holds well-done featurettes. I recommend this to fans of the concept and/or science fiction. Just be aware that this isn't as great. 7/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

With that said, let's look at why people don't like this movie, at least according to the numerous postings on this site:1. A case of cognitive dissonance: nothing but talk/nothing but action and special effectsThis is very confusing to me, since many people complain about too much talking (which was great) with not enough action, and about too much action (which was also great) with not enough substance and dialogue.  These are predominant complaints that are directly opposite of each other.  So which is it?  It's largely a matter of how much one expects from a sequel to The Matrix.2. It was a big disappointment from the first Matrix movie.Disappointment follows expectations.  What did you expect?  The Matrix Redux?  The Matrix Repeated?  Obviously there will be comparisons drawn, but the fact is that the two movies are VERY DIFFERENT--and I'm not talking about which one was better than the other; they are simply different.  And isn't that how it should be, as a matter of fact?  If you have a trilogy that's simply three same movies, what's great about that?  The first and the second installments are (and supposed to be) designed differently because they serve different purposes in the grand scheme of a trilogy.  (This is particularly annoying when I hear people saying ""Empire Strikes Back"" was the worst of the Star Wars trilogy, when it was pretty obvious to me that it was much more skillfully made and directed than the original Star Wars.)3. It was too long.It was TWO minutes longer than the first Matrix.  What, couldn't hold the attention span through Neo's interaction with the Architect, the most shocking, revealing, and in a way exciting part of the entire movie (actually, in a way, of the entire trilogy so far).  Yeah, you could've cut out 5 minutes of the Celebration of Humanity/Zionic Rave, but can't you just sit still for a bit?  Titanic -- now THAT was long and boring!4. It was boring.Go watch a Jet Li movie.  He does those change-directions-in-mid-air moves too, and he does it for good solid 90 minutes of his movies.  And of course, there are plenty of Matrix knockoffs (like hey, ""The One"" with Jet Li!) you can watch.  Weren't you expecting at least a little philosophical discussion based on the first Matrix movie?5. The first was much better.First of all, this is insufficient and even irrelevant to the discussion of the movie's quality.  Again, these are separate movies designed to serve different roles in a trilogy.In fact, I think this movie surpasses the predecessor because it's less formulaic.  The first one was ""revolutionary"" (actually, it's not THAT revolutionary except that its sleek style reached much more audience than others movies with similar concept, e.g. ""Dark City"") but you have to admit it followed a kind of archetypal storybook sort of plot: discovery of a Savior figure, his struggles to discover the power within him, epic battles at the climax, and right up to the good ol' Sleeping Beauty-esque kiss that brings the loved one back to life.  ""Reloaded"" does not follow any of that. It's a brand-new territory; VERY EXCITING!  We have a hero who is not battling mostly with his identity rather than discovering his powers.  We have great philosophy running through about levels of control and in the end we are left to wonder if everything we've learned in the first Matrix is true.  This is beyond great; it's fantastic!  The makers of ""Reloaded"" has abandoned the conventional and safer route for an even more challenging and superb road that puts its own neck on the chopping block.  Coming out of the theater, I was left with a lot of questions (which I assume will be answered for the most part in ""Revolutions""), but it felt wonderful to be challenged in even more daring ways by the world of the Matrix.So it seems like much of criticism and disappointments come because people choose to come with certain ideas and biases in their minds. 
The problem is, indeed, choice.

The Wachowski brothers understand what made The Matrix a hit, so they went to their lab and delivered a reved-up version that tries desperately to be a drama in addition to an action/special effects movie.  Too bad the story is so weak.  However, fans will probably not be disappointed by the action sequences.  Keanu Reeves and the brilliant Hugo Weaving face-off in some virtual gang rumble that is so fast it is difficult to keep up with your eyes.  Thought Weaving (Agent Smith) was one of the best things about the first movie - but he suffers from overexposure in the sequel.  Lawrence Fishbourne and Carrie-Anne Moss are perfect in recapturing their characters.  MANY MANY new characters are introduced.  Actually too many.  Jada Pinkett Smith has a nice turn in a role that could have been developed.  The stunning Monica Bellucci (Tears of the Sun) provides some eye candy, even boxer Roy Jones, jr has a brief role. Best surprise was seeing Anthony Zerbe, a TV staple in the 60's and 70's, who is just not seen much these days.  Overall, thought the CGI was a bit heavy at times, but the fight sequences remain ultra cool.  Make sure you stay until the end of the incredibly long credits segment at the end.  By the way, what is Dave Matthews doing singing a song for a special effects movie?","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film evokes divisive opinions about its quality because, in some ways, it is good, and in other ways, it is terrible. The special effects exemplify this by mixing impressive practical stunts with off-putting CGI. Meanwhile, the overall filmmaking is above-average but, unfortunately, in service of a subpar script. The cinematography is engaged and lightly artistic, the sound is immersive and stylish, and the production design is elaborate and detailed. The cast is strong and the music is memorable. Still, Reloaded misses many viewers because its writing is plagued with issues.First, Reloaded is boring. Much of its time is spent on long-winded conversations that say very little. The story fancies itself philosophical, but fails because it isn't as deep as it hopes. Themes of choice and control are beaten to death, all centering around Neo's love for Trinity. However, because such emphasis is placed on this relationship, its shallowness is exposed. Their romance worked as a cherry on top of the original, but needed fleshing out to carry Reloaded. Thus, we have a dull plot centered around a dull relationship. Ultimately, Reloaded's focus is misguided and dampens its solid craftsmanship.Writing: 3/10

Here, a war to end all wars looms between man & machine. The fate of the human race is in Neo's hands but first he's got to determine exactly what's expected of The One.It seems that the Wachowski brothers took a ""Star Wars"" approach to their trilogy. By that I mean that this middle film is basically a cliff-hanger that sets the stage for the final showdown.Most of the principal actors are back and there are a few new faces as well. The acting is generally on par with the previous film; in other words, not outstanding but solid and above average for an action flick.The action itself, though, is strangely not as satisfying as in the ""The Matrix"". This is puzzling because it cannot be denied that the effects are even more polished than in the original film. I suppose that the novelty had worn off somewhat but I also think that some of the action set-pieces seem arbitrary and tacked on. It also doesn't help that, unlike in the first film, the 'good guys' seem to be practically invincible. Where there's no danger, there's no excitement.Another drawback for this film is that the further exploration of the inner workings of the Matrix gets tiring after a while. But that may be just me, since I have a dislike for science fiction that emphasizes science at the expense of fiction.Nevertheless, the Wachowski's deliver the goods once again in the visual department. The direction is solid throughout and the effects are even slicker than in the first film. The music, including the score by Don Davis, has much of the same flavor as the original.In the end, the film failed to live up to the expectations of fans and I count myself among them. It's not necessarily a bad film but it isn't likely to make you rush out and see the concluding film, even with the cliff-hanger ending.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The wave of hype surrounding the film resembled the `Star Wars' and `Harry Potter' releases, and is the first of two sequels to complete the trilogy. Reloaded continues the story of a band of humans who are locked in a deadly struggle against alien/invasion. The majority of the population is suspended in a blissful dream state unaware that the world they live in is an illusion. Those that are able to be free of the dream state, battle the invasion over a vast network knows as `The Matrix' by enabling cyber implants in their bodies. While in the Matrix, people can fight the invaders and accomplish missions using a variety of skills and weapons.<p> The new film picks up after the events of the first film with Neo (Keanu Reeves), Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss), and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburn), returning to the last human city of Zion to recharge their ship from battle and to prepare for another mission. It seems the forces of evil are burrowing toward the buried city and will soon arrive for an all-out cataclysm. There are those amongst the humans who believe that Neo is the chosen one, and others that do not believe the prophecy that Neo is the savior and this forms a point of contention for the human leaders. The film is awash in effects as Neo and his crew set off on a mission to save humanity but sadly the story seems to get lost along the way. While the film has plenty of effects and action, none of them seem particularly exciting, and I noticed a real lack off cheers and applause from the screener crowd during action scenes as much of it had a been there seen that look to it, that despite upping the quantity, was the same as we saw in the last film. The bullet-time effects are getting stale as it seems to be the only trick in the films arsenal, and the creative team behind the film goes to the well far to many times given a sense of tedium to what are otherwise well-crafted and designed scenes. There was also a severe lack of tension in the film and Reeves lack of emotion and his monosyllable delivery made it hard to really get behind the plight of the characters. Several people mentioned after the screener that they could not make sense of many of the plot elements and that they did not think that the characters were well defined or developed.<P> What I saw was a film that had some nice effects that quickly became boring as the setup and execution lacked any tension and the plot lacked cohesion making it difficult for many in the audience to get caught up in the film. This point was further underlined by the lack of any applause at the end of the film and several disparaging remarks being loudly uttered as the audience filed out of the cinema. I found myself trying hard to like the film but despite the number of effects they were very ho-hum as if I was watching a FX real and many of the best effects had already been shown in the previews. Lets hope that `Matrix Revolutions' can end the trilogy on a high note, as `Matrix Reloaded' is a misfire.<p> <P> 2.5 stars out of 5 <P> Gareth Von Kallenbach <P> International Association of film critics","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Here is just a selection: That a bit of cheap music can instantly create a bit of tension or take me back in time. That big subjects don't necessarily make for big movies (nor the other way round). That I don't like people trying to disguise cliché (including that tried and trusted good-versus-bad theme) by trying to wrap it up in so much wordy and visual nonsense. (Guess which one of those faults the Matrix Reloaded falls in to?!)Entertaining or not, the film makes little to no overall sense. However there are bits of plot I think I understand: It is set in two versions of the world, one the world of dreams (or close variations) and another in the ""real world."" The ""real world"" is just a mine shaft in the ground where a group of escaped prisoners play revolutionaries against the computer - The Matrix - that entraps them. In other words a lot of what we see is a video-game played out in a giant computer - but you can actually ""die"" in this video game through the film's own convenient b/s logic.Yes the script is pure garbage, in that no can really understand what is going on and this - or so the authors hope and presume - will prevent anyone from questioning it. After all you can't question what you don't understand, right? This movie has a logic all of its own and often the reverse of any known human version. Why stand and fight when you can flee through flight? Trapping humans in order create electricity, huh? First Spielberg with his ""futuristic"" three wheeler cars and now this!Is this not the central paradox of sci-fi: People that are smart beyond are wildest dreams judged by what they create and are also incredibly stupid judged by what they say and do?(The Wachowski Brothers don't do interviews so no one can question them about this b/s world of their own invention. I suppose the praise they receive is the praise that many people who build castles in the air receive: Stolen from people that do great work in the real world and who are far smarter. There is a million miles between thinking up ""a car that runs on tap water"" and actually creating a real one!)The look is quite interesting and the fact that so many people were dark glasses gives us the feeling that no one is quite human. Even when they are. Or sort of. Black people seem to have a large role to play and that is indeed curious - but like a lot of what goes on here, I have no idea what it means. Maybe they are the ""blacks with no soul"" that were mentioned in Kentucky Fried Movie. People that turn this handicap to their advantage by playing MOR at weddings!The worst bit is the computer operator (Link) who gives a running commentary on proceedings like he is on a speedway track. Having seen people being captured (Superman like) from certain death with my own eyes it is good that this is confirmed verbally. Second worst bit is the creator of the Matrix (well he claims he is - he is a white bearded theatrical lovey so he must have!) who spouts even more riddles than your old maths teacher.Bruce Lee (most famous for Enter the Dragon which this apes), with only his body and the occasional numchucka created tension, speed and excitement that they can only top by millions of dollars worth of computer special effects and fly-by-wire. No let me take that back: Bruce you were still better than all of them, even with their special effects and wire work.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Initially hooked on a wild action, a way of storytelling. Cyberpunk, which the directors presented under a new, previously unfamiliar sauce. Only then, people, reviewing their favorite movies from time to time, began to be imbued with mythology. And it turned out that one project cannot show a much larger world, which the heroes told us about. And of course, the luck of the first picture allowed us to give the green light to the sequels. At least, after the finale of the 1999 film, it did not seem that it was needed. But I think the creators wanted to earn more, while expanding the universe of the project, where events take place and show how the world of machines will try to destroy the last city of people.In fact, the beginning of the ""Reboot"" raises a lot of questions and even in some way erases what we were shown at the end of the first film. It seemed clear that there is a Chosen One, he commands the matrix. Acts as it pleases him. But the start of the second picture shows that the Chosen One still needs to learn how to act correctly, to be able to live in the real world, where, it turns out, not so many people believe in the prophecy of the Messiah. Controversial scenes and arguments, they initially stump, but later the viewer is carried away by what is happening on the screen, which slightly leaves aside legitimate questions.Despite the fact that the Wachowskis made a strong bet on special effects in the picture, they do not forget to develop mythology. More and more new characters are introduced into the plot, which are designed to show that the world of machines and the matrix itself are much more diverse and complex than it was shown earlier. Now there are new dangerous villains here, and the ubiquitous agents do not seem to be such a serious threat anymore. Although of course they are also deadly.Neo is worried. Yes, he is gnawing at a new role that he did not ask for. Too many are counting on him, and some even believe that he is the key to the end of the century-old war with machines. Keanu Reeves perfectly conveys the experiences of his hero, who is in constant search of the meaning of his existence. Morpheus seemed to have faded into the background. He acted as a wise mentor in the first film, but here he seemed to have retreated into the shadows. Somehow, his interesting monologues are not even enough. Although, on the other hand, he still showed the main character what the matrix is, fulfilled his mission. Now he's ready to just be around. Trinity and Neo's relationship looks kind of vulgar, in my opinion. You watch the characters, but you understand, either you just don't believe the actors, or their still young relationships are shown this way. They have love, but they still have to work on it.Zion shows us people's lives, reveals the world of the ""Matrix"" even more. It turns out that there are many ships with the same commands as Morpheus, there is a legislative and executive body, a hierarchy. Everyone in this world fulfills their role. The first picture only mentioned all this. Here we see everything with our own eyes.I liked that there are new storylines. For example, with Morpheus' former lover Niobe, who is now with his rival. There is Persephone in the matrix, who was once happy with a Frenchman, and now even claims that he was like Neo. You wonder what if the Chosen One was a negative hero. We could get a completely different story. The final meeting and the Architect's super-clever story seems too long and with an overabundance of abstruse phrases and terms. Wachowski's attempt to show the reasoning of the machine in this way, in my opinion, led many viewers to a dead end. The general meaning was clear, but you watch it with furrowed brows, trying not to lose the thread of the narrator's reasoning, which broadcasts unexpected events and versions of the matrix for the viewer.The visual part of the picture is, of course, the decoration of the ""Reboot"". Excellent battle scenes, decent graphics for that time, a highway chase scene and accompanying music are simply brilliant. From a visual point of view, this movie is much better than the previous one. A great fight with agents, where Master Daniel Bernhard appears, a fight with Seraph, Merovingen's wards in a fight with Neo - all this is already an order of magnitude higher than the final battle of Neo with Agent Smith in the first part. Well, the chase on the highway generally makes you watch the action on the screen with your mouth open. You are especially surprised when you find out later that an entire highway was built for these scenes.The second film about the matrix, for me, is undoubtedly a great movie. There are bright memorable characters, brilliant action scenes, chases and fights. On the other hand, the mythology of the cyberpunk world, as shown by the first film of the franchise, seemed to have gone somewhere to the side. Well, what's missing here is the gloominess of the first film. Many people took this Wachowski film with a chill, scolding for the lack of a clincore of the first project, probably deservedly. But for me, ""Reboot"" has become my favorite series of the trilogy, probably still because of the greater action on the screen. In terms of philosophy, this project loses to the original.10 out of 10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Matrix Reloaded made me appreciate the Matrix a little bit more however, as it seems to be a bit unfocused when compared to the first film which seemed to be well written and well made.Reloaded is inconsistent and it seemed a bit rushed and a bit of a mess when I saw it. Zion, which was talked about a lot in the first film, is now seen for the first time, but it's here where I was getting worried about this film already. Sequels often fail when they're just a carbon copy of the original, so I didn't mind the change in setting at the beginning of this film and all these new characters being introduced, but it just wasn't gripping and was very slow moving.Eventually the film speeds up and there's some awesome action. Like the first film Reloaded is often visually stunning, and it's the weird and wonderful exiles that are the highlights. From the moment Neo encounters the Merovingian, a very intriguing character, I was anticipating what was going to happen next and the film seemed to get better and better, leading up to the meeting with the Architect. This middle section is overall very good and great to watch.The main problem with Reloaded is that scenes just go on far too long much of the time. For example, when the Oracle is first reintroduced, this is a great scene at first, Gloria Foster's all-knowing mother figure, who was very interesting in the first film, returning again. But a few minutes later, and I'm getting bored, there's only so much philosophical discussion about Neo's choices that I can take. When this conversation finally ends, we move straight onto the Burly Brawl, the brilliant and visually stunning fight between Neo and the masses of Agent Smiths. That is, until it's gone on for far too long and bored me to tears. This section then, with the Oracle and The Burly Brawl, could have been shortened greatly to make it far more gripping and interesting.The worst scene not only of this film, but probably of the last few years that I can remember, suffers from a similar problem. As Morpheus delivers his speech to the people of Zion at the beginning of the film, they all go mad and start partying late into the night! This scene is just cringe-worthy, slow motion takes of Zion's people dancing to some dance music, inter-cut with Neo and Trinity having sex. I want to know what was going through the Wachowskis' heads when they filmed this scene, I do not understand what they are trying to achieve with it one bit. The worst thing about it is that at this early stage, I already equate Zion with this terrible scene. The scene goes on for way too long as well, a minute of this would have been tolerable, but it seems to go on for about five minutes. Enough already! One scene which doesn't go on too long is the awesome freeway chase scene which is up there with anything that the first film can offer. This was a scene which I wanted to go on for longer, as the creepy Twins chase Trinity down a packed road, while agents appear and place Morpheus in trouble. This scene is awe-inspiring and is backed up by a great piece of music by Juno Reactor which fits the quick tempo of the scene perfectly.Overall, when Reloaded is concentrating on some great action inside the Matrix and the strange beings which inhabit it, it plays like a question and answer session on the first film, answering all our questions that we might have had when we first heard the concept of the Matrix (what if...). It's the beginning at Zion which is slow-moving, and other scenes which are just too long, that prevent it from being great.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"7","/10","The Matrix Reloaded","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1374271/?ref_=tt_urv","jon2005","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3429591/?ref_=tt_urv","22 May 2006","Hype is a film-makers worst enemy. As showcased by the disappointing The Phantom Menace, hype can seriously damage a film's, or a series', reputation. Such is the case with The Matrix Reloaded. After the truly inspired Matrix sprung up out of nowhere in 1999, the sequels had such a huge expectation placed on them, in no small part by the films producer, Joel Silver, that it was naïve to believe that they could turn out a film as fantastic as was promised. And that's exactly what happened, because the Matrix Reloaded, despite several excellent moments, just does not have the originality or style that the original did. Keanu Reeves, Lawrence Fishbourne, and Carrie-Ann Moss have reprised their roles as Neo, Morpheus and Trinity, but whereas last time they all seemed so human, now they seem to have had their humanity taken away, particularly in the case of Neo, who seems just as soulless as the machines he is fighting against. It's a real shame, as it was Neo's humanity that made him such a fascinating character in the first film.The beginning of the film does not help matters either. We start off very promisingly with a dream sequence, which shows off the extraordinary bullet-time effects that made the first film such a breakthrough. But within five minutes it's over, and we are left with an overlong introduction to Zion, the last human city, and to the increasingly complicated plot. The Zion section has to be the real low-point of the film, and as it is at the beginning of the film, that sense of disappointment seems to run through the whole two and a half hour running time. Once it is over, though, the film really starts to shine, and the enormous budget can be seen taking effect. Here we have everything that made the first film great magnified ten times, as Neo unleashes his Agent-stopping powers on 100 Agent Smiths, and a hall full of vampires, not to mention one of the longest and most impressive freeway chases currently on film. This middle hour is the films' saving grace; it is a magnificently choreographed kung-fu-fest, showcasing the great combination of computer effects and live action that few films have utilised successfully. On top of this is a rip-roaring powerhouse of a soundtrack that keeps the atmosphere strong throughout the film, being both a fine example of a rock soundtrack and giving more mellow pieces, keeping the mood without being melodramatic. Once the final chapters come in, however, we end up back where we started  disappointed, and this time utterly confused. Repeated viewings are necessary to understand all of what the Architect says in his (now infamous) thesaurus-straining speech, and it does not help that we will not find out the answers to all the questions posed until the final instalment, released a full six months later. It's a real shame that the Wachowski brothers seemed to miss what made the original so great, and throw in too much philosophical nonsense to try and pad things out, as if they were making the script up as they went along. Whilst the centre of the film is a stunning achievement, the beginning and end just shows how much work will be needed for Revolutions to redeem the Matrix name. Rated: 8/10 More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.netSecond opinion/Re-viewing:Having seen this many more times now, the flaws are more obvious. Sure, it looks good - stunning, even - but because this is a sequel it necessitates comparison with the original; and it is simply not as good. The original had a great idea that sat so well on its own, but the sequels complicate matters needlessly. Also, the first time I saw the film the effects looked great, but now with more time to evaluate them some already look dated and fake. The freeway chase, which seemed so cool the first time, has been surpassed many times, even by the likes of films like Bad Boys II (2003). It all looks like a well designed video game (ironic, I know) but it just does not immerse the audience like the original film did. It's still very stylish; it's not all bad, really, it does have some truly excellent parts, but it's also not a patch on the original. Could have been more, and should have been more.Re-rated: 7/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

That said, it's not casual movie going. If you don't enjoy thought and want the plot dished out on a silver platter, this movie will drive you insane. One complaint I've seen in many reviews is that it's like sitting through a master's seminar in parts. I agree, except I don't see it as a flaw. The story and thought are revealed in a mix of western discussion as well as eastern teaching through metaphor.The action is very well done with a high quality than anything that has been seen yet. It continues in the sci-fu tradion of the first Matrix. The style of martial arts is solid chinese (with a Japanese katana to boot). Many of the the fight scene concepts are new (100 Smiths, the spectres, etc) from the first movie.As the summary suggests, this movie is not for people who are looking for another Terminator. But for those who are tired of the usual fair, it is more than you could wish for.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Illegal operations, General Protection Faults and so on. So it is obviously difficult for me to believe the premise behind the Matrix movies. Humanity is plugged into a giant computer simulation of reality. We know, of course, from experience that such a thing is impossible; it would be crashing every five seconds, just like our computers now do. The Matrix Reloaded actually addresses this issue, and raises the prospect that certain elements of the Matrix are, indeed, malfunctioning. Certain programs run amok, and they are doing so in, it seems, vast numbers. One of these is the former Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who is now independent and seems to have the ability to duplicate himself. This leads to a ludicrous, but spectacular, sequence in which Neo (Keanu Reeves), that now quasi-messianic beacon of hope for humanity, is fighting hundreds, if not thousands, of Hugo Weavings (as if one were not sufficient). That is the problem with The Matrix Reloaded: the spectacular ludicrousness. Much of the movie makes little sense; there is one sequence in which Neo talks to the designer of the Matrix, the 'Architect' who speaks not one word of normal English throughout the conversation. There are more fights and action sequences than there were last time; indeed Neo, his 'boss' Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburn) and girlfriend Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) seem to spend almost their entire screen time beating people up, shooting them or being chased by Agents. There is a car chase that looks like it was filmed in Sydney that is one of the best I have seen in a long time, which ends up with Morpheus having a fisticuff battle with an Agent on top of a moving truck. Neo's 'supernatural' qualities - being the grand saviour of the human race - are played up to their breaking point in this film, and it gets a little tiring after a while. But if you stay away from that, and concentrate on spectacular action sequence after spectacular action sequence, the film holds up well. There are some unnecessary scenes, such as a 'rave party' of sorts intercut with a lurve scene between Reeves and Moss, and a rather incomprehensible scene with a French restaurateur who is really a sentient computer program and his wife, whose actions and purpose are never adequately explored. The Matrix Reloaded is part one of two, with Matrix Revolutions to start showing later this year. I certainly want to see that film, if only because of the rather climactic cliffhanger at the end of this one, but I'm not certain making two films with the one continuing storyline is a good idea. It might have been a better product all round if it had been one film, with one plot and less guff. Still, if you're looking for an action-packed film that looks fantastic, The Matrix Reloaded does nicely. Concentrate on the action and forget the plot; it'll work out much better. Good-o-meter Rating: 7/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Throughout history, totalitarian states have grappled with the problem of controlling it's slaves and their rebellions. This film dares to devote a lot of screen time in an almost academic way to the complex problems an advanced technological machine culture would have dealing with it's slave labour, giving a strange poignancy to the helplessness of the humans crushed by these cold machinations. The result is a boring, weird and brilliant film. I am certainly intrigued as to how the story will be concluded, hopefully in an original way and not a banal shoot-em-up. we shall see.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I don't remember why, especially because watching it for the first time tonight, I enjoyed it quite a lot. I'm admittedly curious to see what Resurrections is all about, but figure I need to work my way through Reloaded and Revolutions first.I think the one area where this exceeds the original might be the action. The powers Neo has at the end of the first are put to good use here, and make for some really crazy and entertaining action sequences. Some of the cgi is inconsistent, although it more often than not works, and the hand-to-hand stuff is truly great. There are some legitimately great martial arts set pieces, and even if the fight with 100 Smiths is silly for some, at least it's impressive, well thought out, and at the very least unique.I was mixed on the attempts to expand the world of the film. I think that may have been a turn-off when I tried to watch it a decade ago? It's still better than the alternative option for a sequel, which is just rehashing the original, so the effort to do that kind of word-building (even if it inflates the runtime) is still appreciated.Agent Smith fit into this one less than seamlessly, but his action scenes were fun, and we'll see where he goes in the third instalment. I also thought Laurence Fishburne was under-utilised at first, but then they give him a samurai sword and I was forced to eat my words.Overall, I don't like it as much as the first, but it was pretty damn good, and I look forward to watching the rest of the series soon.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I did remember how I really disliked part 3. Too much fancy dialogue that really had no substance. Just pseudo-philosophical nonsense. So when Reloaded popped up on Netflix, I had to check it out.Oh boy. These dialogues are painful to listen to. When I watched it back in the day, I was still impressed. Now that I am a little older, a little wiser? It sounds so clever and so spiritual, but quite frankly, that is just a pretty dress to hide the fact, that the story got weird and no one offers a real explanation. Maybe the writers were a little too much in love with their material? The success of the ever so great Matrix (part I) made them think that anything is possible? Well, everything is not possible.I am now 40 years old. Monica Bellucci kissing Neo or everybody wearing these cool shades (in the underground, in the dark), well, that doesn't compensate for the fact, that the plot doesn't really make sense.The Matrix part one was amazing. It will forever be in my top ten. All the rest? Basically just a lot of artists' ego put on film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Obviously, these scenes were important to the story, but i couldn't help feeling they went on a bit too much. After all, watching a thousand identical characters get kicked all over the place for five minutes can wear a little thin! Don't get me wrong, the action scenes are outstanding, and i suppose it's like criticizing 'Airplane' for having too many jokes; but the complexity and intricacy of the plot was what really stood out as the film's strong-point as it explored the nature of the matrix itself.Reloaded develops the Matrix story into far-reaching directions only hinted at in the first film, and most importantly credits the viewer with a great deal of intelligence, something that the majority of mainstream movies neglect to do. The development of the plot is both swift and measured, meaning you have to think hard when not having your eyes burned out by the bullet-fast action scenes. Oh, and Lambert Wilson is great in a scene-stealing role as the Merovingian!All-in-all an incredible film.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Let's start with the basics. It's not as good as the first one. Many of the fight sequences do seem to be little more than fillers. There is little to no development in overall style or technique from the first movie. The storyline is frequently lazy and complacent. Much of the dialogue was insipid. All of these are valid criticisms. But - worst movie ever made? Come on you guys. There was a lot of extremely dense plotting towards the end of the movie which you probably didn't notice as you were too busy being disappointed. Had you paid proper attention, you would see that some elements of the Matrix Universe (fight sequences and special effects notwithstanding) do represent a considerable development from the tremendous promise laid down in the first film. Don't expect the sequel to be the ground-breaking phenomenon that the first one was. That is not a sequel's role.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

but with all sequels it has it's flaws as well. (There easy to overlook).I think that this takes place at least six months after the first,
and we get to see Zion an underground sanctuary where the human race
hides, we also learn that the machines are digging their way to them.
Neo flies, a prophecy is talked about and there is a ticking clock to all-out 
war with the machines.
(Let me get into the flaws first).First I would like to say that this is a fun movie, great action scenes
great visual effects. But the movie manly lacks in I would say character
development, maybe a bit of the story is a little muttled, and a little
confusing and convoluted. I can't place my finger on it but it's there,
to put it simply they should have done something else for the story.
Even before I seen this I was kinda expecting something different,
you know, new villains, new threat just something cool but different. 
Not that what is in it isn't and not that I was let down or anything when
I watched it but I'm saying that it was missed opportunities for something
really special.
(On to the good stuff).The action scenes are awesome and quite memorable,
my favorites are when Trinity is on the freeway in a high speed chase,
Morpheus fighting an agent on a semi-truck's trailer all the bad ass fights
with Neo.
There is a scene where Neo kisses Monica Bellucci that is quiet erotic
also Neo and Trinity have a sex scene in this, I can tell the directors wanted
to have some sex in this film LOL.
A side from that this was an enjoyable film to watch all though I do watch
this film a lot less these days, I do find myself going back to the first more
often. But this one is still good and ends on a cliffhanger leaving you wanting
more.Overall I give it a 7/10. Fun to watch every once and a while.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But, it really affected the quality of the film. First part was the cream, confined to the subject and every second was thrilling and interesting. Here, audience are dragged into so many things, which are not really necessary or should have been done better, like the underworld, and other ships. Fight scenes kept the standard, though some parts of the CGI is amateur. The free way chase and action sequences are the best and one of my most favorites in the movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

And obviously its sequel would not have such a mind-blowing plot like the first movie did, but it would just limit itself to narrate Neo's path to try to disable the Matrix after realizing he is the One. I watched the 1999 movie yesterday, and today I woke up thinking about it, which I think it proves what a good movie it was. And I couldn't wait to watch this movie, because I was obsessed with knowing how on Earth could the Matrix be disabled.But this movie is not about it. It's just another action movie. Perhaps it was quite pioneer in that sub-genre that super hero movies are (which are now much more widespread than when this trilogy was released), but, honestly, I'm not into that kind of stuff. What I'd loved from the first movies were all the philosophical themes it dealt with, but these are hardly seen in Matrix Revolutions. You've got instead lots of kung fu fighting, cars being blown up with a katana (!?) and visual effects that might have been impressive for the time but that they now seem taken from a PlayStation.What saved it from giving it a lower score was the scene with the Architect, which is by far the best scene of the movie. The Architect is quite a fascinating character that reminded me of the Masonic Great Architect of the Universe, and I like how his lines, very well written, bring about some nietzchean Doctrine of the Eternal Recurrence to that contemporary Plato's Cave that the Matrix is. If I had seen this movie in the cinema, this scene would have been worth the ticket. You've also got some good ideas about causality and the dilemma freedom-fate, specially in Morpheus' character, who insists on people's free choices but blindly believes in a prophecy that would obviously bind people's actions to an a priori determined course of action. But who cares about it, people just want to to watch Neo stop bullets and fight thousands of Agent Smiths at the same time.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is indeed a film that doesn't match up quite to the original (what could, really), but what is breathtaking is how the Wachowskis' feel a confidence, mastery of their medium of sci-fi action storytelling.  Even when the film gets all too deep into the philosophical speculations and dialogue (which the first balanced with the action perfectly), it rebounds to get to what the audience wants to see- fights, chases, gun and knife/sword battles, and all the visual effects that can be brought forth in a Hollywood picture.
I won't say too much of the plot except that in the second installment we see our heroes, Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity, facing the oncoming of the war with the machines, and how they, and more specifically Neo, will be tested to their limits.  These limits make up the sum of the visual effects and action sequences, which are about 60 to 65 percent of the whole movie. And that's what makes the film a worthy watch (not the acting, since it's even lesser than in the first one, as Keanu Reeves proves) is that there seems to be always something to look at, admire, and maybe even dismiss as TOO un-real.Bottom line, The Matrix Reloaded isn't a great movie, like it's monumental predecessor, however it doesn't leave I, as I'm sure it won't leave others, with a sense of money not well spent.  As one character said, ""The choice, I leave up to you.""  Grade: A","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

But it is obvious why. Everybody who saw ""The Matrix"", was so excited because it was a big surprise, but most important there were no expectations of that first movie. Everybody who saw ""The Matrix"" expected ""Reloaded"" to be so much better and so incredible that they forgot to think realistic of this movie. So it should have been obvious that it was impossible to top the first movie, but it was possible to hang on it somehow. Gaeta's Visual Effects are again incredible and amazing, they are definitely better than in the first one. Neo is doing things that are unbelievable, but somehow normal because he's ""The One"", and ""The One"", the anomaly of the Matrix, is able to do anything in the Matrix. Smith is back, and he is not any longer an agent of the Matrix, there is a mystic connection between him and Neo, that you will know when you see the third part of the trilogy. Trinity would give anything for Neo and Morpheus is just as cool and strong as in the first part. The Machines are digging. There is no time to breathe while watching the movie. Watch the Animatrix and play Enter The Matrix to get some background knowledge, and it is important to see ""Reloaded"" several times to understand it and to see the details, that made me love the movie just as I did the first one. It is a great instalment of the Matrix cult. Free your mind and you will love it. 10 out of 10 rating points.

In a summer full of sequels, the Matrix was clearly the favorite for the summer of 2003.  This movie can not live up to that hype. In fact, it could not live up to half the hype it has received.I saw some mixed reviews before going to see the movie and consequently I lowered my expectations a bit before going in.  I knew that I would have to turn off my brain for this movie and just enjoy the ride, but the result here was just ridiculous.To really delve into the flaws of the movie would spoil the few decent plot twists that are sparsely distributed in this bloated film.  So, I can only scratch the surface here.  Honestly, the plot of this movie, if it was put together in a denser manner, would far exceed the plot of X2.  But this is a less enjoyable movie than X2.  I have to imagine that in the editing room, this labor of love was too close to the directors' hearts to cut down some scenes.  But this movie really needs some harsh love to make it a better film.I've heard plenty of complaints from friends and other reviewers about the scenes in the Zion being overdone.  These complaints are warranted, and I agree.  I can't believe I am saying this, but the fight scenes are also too long, and quite overdone.The prime example is a scene that we catch a glimpse of in the trailer:  Neo takes on a swarm of agents single-handedly.  The actual scene, when played out, feels as if it were a half hour long, and is almost boring by the end. This scene had potential, it should have been the next coming of Bruce Lee in Enter the Dragon fighting off a swarm of guards.  But this scene is about as much fun as watching someone play a video game with the cheat codes turned on.  You never get a sense that Neo is going to lose.  You know from the first movie that Neo has powers beyond kung fu, to manipulate the Matrix itself, but here he's just flipping around punching and kicking agents all over, and never really inflicting any substantial damage.  It feels like the fight choreographer wanted to show Neo kicking agents from every possible angle, and expects us to wait while each of these angles is demonstrated. About halfway through this fight, there are so many agents on screen that they make a very obvious switch over to a computer generated fight scene. You can easily see the switch because Keanu's overly-stiff kung fu style suddenly is overly-graceful and flowing.  Sure, it looks cool, but it's obviously not Neo.  It's someone playing a video game, and the audience doesn't get to play, just watch.  By the end, you're thankful that it's over, instead of begging for more.Unfortunately, about half the drama in-between the fight scenes is even more dull and useless to the plot.  Worst of all, there is one key character from the first movie that is gone in this installment, dismissed in trite retrospect, and his replacement is a quite unwelcome bit of comic relief.  I don't want to spoil who is missing, but trust me, you'll know, and you'll miss him.So, is it really that bad?  Am I being unfair?  Maybe.  Some of the action scenes are pretty darn good.  And like I said before, there are some decent plot elements here that could elevate this movie if they weren't so diluted. And, if I had to pick the best thing about this movie, it was the possibilities created for the next film.  There is the possibility that Neo and his crew will face dangers other than agents and sentinels, but those possibilities are really only hinted at in this movie.  If they are making promises for the next film, however, I will be there.  But some advice for the Wachowski brothers if they happen across this little blurb of mine:  I know that you are capable of better filmmaking than this, and better thinking than this.  Don't be shy with the knife when it comes to editing time.  Go and watch the first Indiana Jones movie.  There is a scene where a man with a huge sword squares off with Indy.  Indy whips out his gun and just shoots him.  It was the smart move.  Neo could benefit from a little of the same common sense.I give it a 7 out of 10, on the strength of the unexplored possibilities that we may see in the final film.  If those are untapped, this trilogy is best left to the first film alone.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

While the story of Reloaded isn't as terrible as others make it out to be, the issue is that it feels as though the movie is constantly being extended by these unnecessarily long action scenes.To being with the positives, a great job was done showing the city of Zion and giving us a glimpse into this almost magical place that we learned about in the first movie. A great job was also done by taking the story to some place that is actually interesting. We get to see these brilliant non generic characters that actually feel original and they all for the most part have some larger impact to the story. We get a story that we can feel for and we understand the emotion of survival that is felt by all characters.While so much of the movie felt great, I ended up feeling bored halfway through due to the extreme uses of action sequences. During the car chase scene we here three different musical compositions played through fully in the background. I swear that if we cut these sequences down to a reasonable time that the film could easily be brought under 90 minutes in length. While the sequences were amazing, I would argue even better than the first movie, they ended up taking so much time with the directors attempting to show as many special effects as possible that they detracted from the story itself.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It had scenes that will be remembered for years to come such as Neo fighting a 100 Agent Smith's, or the car chase taking your breath away with every twist and turn. Most of all, the moment Neo dives between two collided trucks on the verge of mass explosion to save his crew. Shocking how something like that can be seen by our own eyes in a cinema and not just in our dreams, that moment alone demands the admission fee. I sat in the cinema and for the first part I felt let down by the rave sequence which wasn't to my taste. I thought it was drawn out and had no purpose in the film, I nearly lost sight, I started to get this sinking feeling. Yet I got beyond that when the pace of the film built up to a furious finale. I was immensely pleased by Reloaded. Every second since I sat through 'The Matrix' I had wanted a sequel. I had wanted to know what was going to happen in the world the Wachowski brothers had created, finally it is here, and I am far from disapointment. I don't see how anyone can be. They are not shortchanging us by leaving us on a cliffhanger they are giving us the 3rd and final part 6 months later so that the trilogy can be finished. I think the series is more of two movies, in which the 2nd and 3rd will act as a 6 hour sequel to the first. So make your judgements after seeing the finished article. All I know is that from the first and second movies I have witnessed movie magic, in scenes which I can talk about with my friends for years to come. I think a problem with reviewing Reloaded so early since its release, not even waiting for a good 5 or so viewings is wrong. 'The Matrix' wasn't a one time only watchable movie. I had to sit through it again and again to understand all of its messages before I could get to grips with the whole concept. This is what should be done with Reloaded. Given time and multiple viewings most fans of the first movie will see it as a fitting second to the series. I recently read the transcript to the meeting between Neo and the Architect, which at the time I became lost after 3 seconds of staring into the old mans beard. Yet reading the script I realised how intelligently the story has evolved. Simply there is too much information to be taken in whilst viewing Reloaded, a stigma attached to the first. So given time Reloaded will be seen as a huge success as it rightly should be. Take away the rave scene and you have yourself a 10 out of 10.
One thing I'd like to see from Revolutions is Neo beating up some fat-blokes. Some ordinary people who can't match his punches and so forth. Just let him beat the crap out of some normal James Bond Cronies for 10 minutes. Now that would be lovely.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was great! I really think that people didn't understand it and rather than admit that they are slamming the movie. Its really annoying to hear people compare this movie with X2 or T3 when they aren't even on the same level. yes, I am sure they are enjoyable movies, but certainly they don't have the depth that Reloaded has. I actually heard someone say of Reloaded ""i hated having to think about it - when I go to a movie I don't want to think"". So, if you want a movie with simple plot themes and that require no thought process Reloaded is definitely NOT the movie for you!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I beg to differ. We'd only heard about Zion in the first film. In this one, we see the city itself, but only a smattering of its purported 250,000 citizens at first, so we needed to see what the stakes were: Ergo, a massive gathering. After they've been given the news that they might all be dead within the next day or so, we needed to see that they haven't lost hope, yet keep them together in the same space, rather than let them disperse and find their own fun activities. Well, pretty much the only display of unity that can be performed with athleticism by an individual in-place while standing shoulder-to-shoulder with thousands of others is dancing.... Club-style! (Tango & Waltz take up too much room!) And hopeless people can't dance! Next time you're feeling suicidal, give it a whirl, you'll see what I mean.I actually found the kiss between Neo & Persephone to be more objectionable.(Oh, and if Neo & Trinity hadn't made love the night before the Big Battle, I'd've never fully believed that there was a physical attraction between those two.)","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

,Actually the fight scene where we watch neo fighting swarms of Agent Smiths really proves that there are no limits for what they can do ,The other scene is the Car chase scene which leaves you breathless during it's running time ,I haven't filled that there were overusing of the special effects at all ,You know they are in the Matrix world where no earthly rules are governing the characters ,And so the amazing fights were necessary to symbolize that ,The other elements like editing and musical score passed the test efficiently ,Another superior elements are the Decoration,Design and costume ,Put in the right places to support the feeling of the old comics as a reflection of the overall atmosphere of unreality surroundings their existence .The wachowskis hits hard and solid this time ,With very generous budget from the producers they had a plenty of time and space to introduce what they want to say ,At some points of the movie you wonder about them ,And how brilliant they are forming their ideas ,Their vision is marked for having no borders ,You are in some point in the movie and making anticipations or guessing about the forthcoming events ,they surprises you with ultimately different things ,And keeps doing this till you give up and stop making pre assumptions ,And this leads us to discuss some aspects about The Matrix's World and the impact it have done on the cinema's Audience ,The problems that many complained about actually are several problems ,One of them is the Zion's people and their appearances but we have to be frank ,The movie is about a world where the machines is controlling it and only one place is left for al the surviving humans so what do you expect from them? do you expect them to be clean and shaven and wears the latest fashion models?! ,About the mass sex scene I think it was designed beautifully ,Just look where Neo And Trinity were making it and you will notice that the place is designed  in a Womb like shape ,It gives a reference for the creation of the humanity and the mass sex itself  can be explained as human touch in a world threatened to be void of humans within few hours ,It has been known that human beings in times of danger tends naturally to seek the warmth of other humans companion and this takes the form of the sexual festival we've seen ,The techno musical score accompanying it reflects the artificial nature of their surroundings ,For these reasons I always thought about the whole scene as effective and necessary in the development process of RELOADED.Other people simply complained that the movie become very complicated ,That's may be right for the most of Mainstream Audience ,The whole trilogy needs an open min willing to give a deep thinking sessions in order to get the message ,And personally I think that many people of whom didn't like this movie were simply because they haven't understood it or simply thought about it as nonsense due to the large and heavy dose of philosophical battles ,Another people hated RELOADED because they had solid grounds based on the first Matrix movie ,Actually one Reloaded Excellency points came from taking the story in a whole new level and so it destroyed all of our beliefs granted from the first Matrix movie","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I can only assume this is the case because their present effort is just plain bad.It wasn't just the ultra-cool fight scenes that introduced movie audiences to the concept of ""bullet-time."" It wasn't just Carrie Ann Moss' fine self drop-kicking bad guys and running up walls whilst clad in skin-tight leather and latex. I mean, don't get me wrong, they were an integral part of the film's entertainment value.But the first film wasn't just a simplistic clash between cartoonish caricatures of good and evil a la Star Wars. It was a revolution fantasy about looking at things in a new way and dealing with the consequences through love and loyalty -- and, okay, kung fu.In the first film we were made to care about our loveless and pathetic protagonist and his humdrum life as he seemed adrift, as so many of us are, in a cynical and lonely cityscape of cubicles and punch-clocks. We cared about him because he was trying to find out why life was like this and we cared because he wasn't falling prey to the pitfalls of drugs and destructive relationships. He was looking for answers and staying pure to his quest. In a real sense, he was every unmarried young urbanite trying to intellectualize himself happy with the help of a computer and a little too much solitude.When the answers find him, he takes a chance and leaves his world for theirs and pays the price big time. The system is not happy he's switched sides and seeks to deprive him of his life, his livelihood, and, what's worse, the hot new woman in his life. Anyone who's ever made a major change in lifestyle can relate to metaphors that illustrate this kind of peril.And it doesn't take a genius to recognize the hidden meanings behind the fact that in one half of the movie Neo (or as he is referred to by Matrix enforcers, Mr. Anderson) is taking orders from whitebread America (his boss, the FBI), and in the second half he's listening to world-weary but wiser poor black housewives (the Oracle) and hipsters (Morpheus).So, it's the computer enthusiast who thinks for himself allied with the funky downtrodden masses against the straight-laced corporate bloodsuckers. This is a story my generation can relate to. The good guys prevail because they see the system for what it is and because they help free each others' minds. And a little kung fu never hurts either.'The Matrix Reloaded' is a total sellout. Our hero isn't in the trenches with his new compadres any more, he's flying over their heads, literally, like Superman, and duking it out with Eurotrash bad guys like it was some sort of Schwarzenegger picture. He lands long enough to have sex with his girlfriend or stand around and look iconic in his shades.They set themselves a pretty high bar for visually interesting fight sequences with the first film and the ones in 'Reloaded' pay off if you try and ignore the fact that it's quite often a completely computer-generated Keanu you see lunging around. But you won't care. This picture's got no soul. All the right actors are there in all the right outfits, but there's way too much of a BattleStar-Galactica-come-Star- Trek-Next-Generation contingent marching around in tunics and talking of ""ships"" and ""crew"" like they had invaded this film from some stupid made-for-SciFi-Channel movie-of-the-week. One particular scene seems matched shot for shot out of the BattleStar Galactica TV series: Our spaceship pilot gets home to his rebel abode and gets a bunch of smack from his warrior wife about being more careful when flying through the Alpha quadrant. I mean what the hell kind of crap am I watching here?I think a better movie would have tested Neo's funky new alliances in some way and would have existed more exclusively in the actual Matrix.But they thought it would be better to be more like Star Wars or something which is a god awful shame for those of us who really related to the intelligence and style of the first picture.Why didn't the Wachowski brothers stay true to their original themes and inspirations? My guess is the Matrix got them.;-)This movie review by Erik Gloor","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This sequel lends nothing to the original: it doesn't pick up where the first one left off, and far from giving us the intrigue and action of the first, it relies on drawn out (confusing) plots, special effects and secondary characters that don't really matter.

Even the fight scenes were on the weak and flimsy side. The entire movie lacked the energy of the original. Not only that, but there was zero chemistry between the stars--who have no personality or charisma, and there was no character development at all. Since the movie put way too much emphasis on the characters, this was a serious problem. This film had some nice effects that quickly became boring as the setup and execution lacked any tension.  The plot had no cohesion making it difficult for many in the audience to get caught up in the film. I found myself trying hard to like the film but failing miserably. Despite the number of effects, they were very ho-hum as if I was watching a FX reel and many of the best effects had already been revealed in the preview trailer. The opening ecstasy/rave sequence and the french guy/Monica Belucci scenes were particularly ridiculous. I may have over-generous with my 3 out of 10 rating.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

View this baby in IMAX!! Enjoy:First of all, NOBODY could have done a better job than the Wachowski Bros. directing, writing the script, film editing, etc.  NOBODY!! Congratulations to them and rest of production crew for a job WELL DONE!
Why this film could NEVER have been better?  Simply the BEST?  Tons of reasons.  I'll list a few right now.  #1) BEST ACTION - Martial arts choreography, the sequences were masterpieces.  Bruce who?  Neo looked soo good executing sweet, graceful martial arts moves.  Freeway scene, 100 Smiths, etc.  Simply the BEST!  #2)  BEST CGI - Could NEVER have been better.  I DARE other film makers to beat The Matrix and Reloaded's sophisticated Action and CGI.  Awesome display and Simply UNBEATABLE!  The best the other lowly producers can do is COPYCAT.  #3) FABULOUS ACTING - Hugo Weaving, don't need to write much about him, the World knows he's the best film villain of all time.  Keanu's acting getting better and better, the beautiful Carrie-Ann, Fishburne, etc.  The Best.  #4) PHILOSOPHY - Logic, Ethics, Metaphysics, Epistemology, Christianity, it's all there, pay attention, look it up.  You'll learn a few things.  #5) FASHION SENSE - Heroes and Villains could NEVER have looked more Cool than what we have seen in the Matrix Trilogy.  NEVER.  Neo made Superguy look like a Fag.  The women were SEXY too!  This movie was flat-out SEXY.  #6) LOVE - We ALL know Love Conquers All.  Enough said.  #7) SOUND and MUSIC - Another Oscar for the talented sound effects editors.  Awesome groups in the Soundtrack. #8) BEST DIRECTING - Wachowski bros.  Enough said.  And Last (for now).  #9) CONCEPT - NO ONE, and I mean NOBODY in this Universe will EVER take away The Matrix CONCEPT.  And NO, I NEVER want to hear about Dim-Witted films that share an inkling of the same Matrix Concept.  The World checked up on those films.  Charlie's Skanky Angels is on top of the COPYCAT list.  The Matrix did it FIRST, did it BIGGER and did it ALOT BETTER.  I can understand the Wachowskis' IRRITATION.  Job WELL DONE in Reloaded.  No other film will EVER Top it.  Congrats again to the W-bros. for Originality.  I can go on and on, blah, blah, blah, but I'll stop here for now.  Enough can Never be said.I'll say this again and again.  NEO (Our New Hero) has made Supergay, well...look pretty and Gay.  He ain't in No Faggety tight blue suit.  Neo Sky-Rockets with shades, now THAT'S how you fly!!  It's ALL about the Black Trench and Shades baby!!  It's a bird!  It's a plane!  It's.Super Who?? NO! It's NEO!!  The World's New and Improved Action Super Hero.Reloaded - HUGE 10 out of 10 Stars. And that was only HALF of it!  The BEST has yet to come.  REVOLUTIONS in November.

"6","/10","Talk, talk, talk... Fight, fight, fight!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0703780/?ref_=tt_urv","Lobo69","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0642632/?ref_=tt_urv","20 May 2003","Ok it's a good movie, very high concept, and of course it had to be to compete with the original. However this movie underlines the fact that it's very hard to top yourself when you set the bar so high in the first place. It's a little ironic that the very guys who set the new standard for action/sci-fi movies are themselves now victims of that very standard.First I'll address some of the concerns I have read in other peoples reviews, then I'll add a few concerns of my own;The big one people seem to have a hard time with is the dancing scene near the beginning of the movie. It seems that most Matrix viewers are comfortable with narrative symbolism but are completely unable to comprehend visual symbolism. The dance scene is symbolic of why humans will always triumph over the machines, it's because we have that joy, that 'rubbing up against each other' that machines don't have and never can have. The dance scene was a symbolic reference to the human spirit, but I guess that concept is a bit subtle considering most of the audience was waiting for buildings to blow up.So I have no problem with that scene, it made perfect sense to me and humanized the movie a little.The other scene people either loved or hated was the Neo vs. 100 Smiths. I have a problem with that scene too but not the problem most other people had with it. My problem is that in the first Matrix, he was able to destroy agents by flying into them and 'absorbing' them or whatever. Why then in this movie does he just keep fruitlessly hitting them over and over with no real results? I can tell you exactly why, because the film makers thought it would look cool to have Neo fighting 100 Smiths, and they decided style was more important than continuity or coming up with a better idea.A better scene would have had Neo destroy all the smiths rather than having hit continually hit them over and over with increasingly big sticks, and then finally retreating. The final scene would have been Neo surrounded by dead Smiths, and would have been cooler than him running away.My second problem with that scene is connected to another fight Neo has a little later after they free the keymaker, Neo has to fight 6 guys who don't seems to be anywhere near as powerful as Smith is. Even though he has only 6 guys to fight instead of 100, it takes him forever to kill them. Why was he able to beat off 100 Smiths without too much trouble, but these 6 guys kept him busy for what seemed like an hour?A better scene would have been for Neo to beat them incredibly fast, solidifying the concept that he is the most powerful thing in the Matrix. This scene diminished his perceived power greatly and for no good reason.I do sympathize with the writers of this movie, they made Neo a little too powerful at the end of the first Matrix, thus leaving themselves little room to move with the character in this movie. Evidence of that can be seen in the tricks they used to keep Neo out of scenes where he simply would have been to powerful, like when he found himself suddenly 500 miles from the battle that was happening on the freeway.These writing tactics are similar to what they have done for years in the Justice League comics, its hard to present any threat to a team where Superman is more powerful than all the other hero's in the group put together. The writers often resort to temporarily de-powering Superman or they conveniently get him out of the way for a while so the other characters have something to do till he can get back to save the day. Both of these things happened to Neo in Matrix Reloaded. The de-powered version of Neo shows up at the end where he destroys 3 squids outside the Matrix. He is so powerful inside the Matrix that I suspect the next movie will happen mostly outside the Matrix where Neo still has some power, but nowhere near as much.I really liked the symbiotic relationship between the machines and Zion. They created a flawed program to fit flawed humans. The flaws in the program always leads to some people escaping and forming a city, and eventually leads to an anomaly like Neo who signals to the machines when the cycle is ending and its time to destroy Zion and start again. It's an elegant solution to the flaw built into the system they made. But it's an ironic plot twist that I think most people missed, again maybe in a movie that is so visually stupefying, narrative subtlety is lost on the viewers.The fact that Neo chose not to continue the cycle is interesting, but again I think that was lost on most of the viewers who were waiting for the next visual feast. Just like the Oracle kept telling him, its about choices, his choice was to continue the cycle or risk everyone's life on a gamble.I guess this movie is an example of how you cannot have your cake and eat it too, when you have that much eye candy on the screen it becomes impossible to get any kind of deeper meaning across to the viewer. I think the impact of the story would have been more dramatic if the visuals had been toned down just a little. But the film makers had themselves boxed into a corner, they simply had to do both. Make it a bigger story and bigger special effects as well. I think they would have been better off topping one or the other, but not both.No rating, it's a good movie, just not an easy one to watch, like staring into the sun too long. I was relieved I did not have to suffer anymore visual dynamite at the end of the movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Matrix Reloaded has become an uneasy collage of sci fi, virtual reality, and martial arts spectaculars interlaced with attempts at emotional human connections and intellectual philosophy. The beginning sequences unfortunately come across as imitations of Final Fantasy computer generated animations (that supposed to represent actual reality) along with the original HR Giger images of Alien creations of an inner earth and Minority Report computer mechanizations. And somewhere along with way, the audience is strangely passed over and dropped into the sequel to Matrix having been left out of about an hour a missing introduction to a whole nether world that we've never seen.Plenty of movies have used virtual reality to good effect - even Virtual Nightmare(2000) which played on the Sci Fi Channel was able to include a triple twist in its two hour playing time duplicating the twists in the Matrix and its sequel minus the martial arts action sequences. Brazil (1985), The Cell (2000), Dark City (1998), The Truman Show (1998), eXistenZ (1999), Freejack (1992), Total Recall (1998); Virtuosity (1995) have all used the virtual idea, some to better impact than Matrix. Matrix: Reloaded, overdoes the action, overplays the martial art action and becomes a rather unsettling series of confusing, exploding, repeatings scenes.While the intent, the energy to make an intelligent, above average sci fi - action -thriller, this Matrix sequel only succeeds in revealing how truly difficult to combine so many elements into an even, compelling memorable movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"9","/10","One of the best sequels ever!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0702868/?ref_=tt_urv","boondocksaint20","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1219124/?ref_=tt_urv","14 May 2003","After paying the 9 dollars for the special sneak preview ticket and waiting in line for over an hour, I have to say that this movie was so worth it. Furthermore, it relieved my fears that it might not have lived up to its extraordinary predecessor since it was, afterall, a hard act to follow, but Matrix: Reloaded follows through very very nicely.First off, the action.  Mother of mercy, there are some spectacular fight scenes!  They will have you picking your jaw off of the ground one minute, laughing another, and becoming awe struck once again.  There are three in particular:  a high speed car chase that redefines any other car chase ever made, a well choreographed fight in and around two staircases featuring some cool medieval weapons and of course, my favorite, the 'Burly Brawl' as the filmmakers call it; Neo fighting 100 Agent Smiths hand to hand.  Awesome to say the least...or should I say, ""Woah...""?Then there are the speeches, which I found to be very interesting. Reloaded gives you the same occasional lines that totally screw with your mind in the best way possible and of course, a lot of explanation into the realm of The Matrix.  There, in fact, is a lot of talk, probably a full hour's worth total if you listened, back to back, all of the verbose speeches given by Morpheus and company...I found these parts very interesting, but, I can see how others may find them boring.  There are so many loose ends left untied, it literally makes your mouth water in anticipation of the grand finale, Revolutions.Keep in mind, this, like many trilogies, is the middle trilogy that continues the first one, but leaves more loose ends to be tied.  There will be a lot of story thrown at you in the 2 and a half hour time frame, so you have to pay attention.  I will definitely see this movie again in the weeks ahead just to get a clearer perspective of all of the twists and turns shown in the movie because they run aplenty.  This one wasn't better than the first one, it was different.  The first one, though in my opinion, is still a better movie overall, it dealt with the birth and awakening of Neo. This one deals with the life of the post-death Neo coping with his new responsibilities and searching everywhere to find his purpose...it is a ravenous desire, and it takes Neo to the edges of The Matrix and back.  It has a slightly different look and feel to it, which I thought was a great way to keep the mind blowing special effects from the first one away from becoming a 'been there, done that'-athon.  I, personally loved it.The Matrix was one of the few movies I have ever given a 10, and rightfully so.  It was a breath of fresh air that literally came out of nowhere, and hooked an entire generation of people to a new breed of movie.  Reloaded is a worthy sequel that does its predecessor justice, and even far surpasses it on some areas.  To me though, what it lacked was the impending feeling of desperation and mystery that the first movie wore on its sleeves.  Like I said though, this is afterall, a totally different movie, and even if it followed the original's formula to a 'T' it would have been very boring and too predictable.  The story is a tad confusing at parts, but so was the first one, and also on that note, I would like to say I've learned my lesson a long time ago, to not judge a confusing movie without watching it at least twice.  Based on my first impression, though, this movie rocks.  It is an incredible summer thrill ride that is a worth successor to the 1999 hit. 9/10 stars.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

So I decided to write it myself.First up, most people will be interested in the special effects and fight scenes. Well if you thought that the effects in the original Matrix were good, prepare to be blown away. Without wanting to spoil the plot for you, I'll just say that the bullet time effects, especially on the Freeway scene are astounding. The fights this time around have more people on screen at once than before. The fights are fast and furious, with more of an edge than before. (There is a pun in there, but you would have to see the movie to get it.)The story this time around is comprehensible. That's because all the tricky confusing stuff has already been done in the first movie. The plot gets built upon and the story of the Matrix and its world is furthered. As it is a trilogy there are some questions that remain unanswered at the moment. If you go in a group you will get an er.. lively discussion regarding what's going to happen next.I felt that there was a bit more emotion to the characters this time around and that the acting was flawless.Not only that but this time there are a few comic one liners that are really funny.Some people have dismissed a lot of the plot and story as psycho babble, but I disagree. You either think it is great or you don't. And you can't decide that until you see it.This is the closest thing I have seen to a perfect movie. I loved it, and I went in thinking that there is no way a sequel could better the original. But it did. It is most definitely worth going to see, don't wait for the DVD, because the big screen just gives it extra oomph. The movie oozes style, and like all good movies, the guys leave the cinema thinking that they too have the same abilities. Which leads to more comic moments in the car park.Overall 10/10.P.S. Stay in until the end of the credits to see the Matrix Revolutions trailer.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"1","/10","Pretentious sci-fi sequel overloads on gadgetry, special effects and technobabble.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704802/?ref_=tt_urv","Silverzero","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1828453/?ref_=tt_urv","7 June 2003","`The Matrix' was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually fantastic but also curiously thought provoking in its `Twilight Zone'-ish manner. The general rule applies here- and this sequel doesn't match up to its predecessor. Worse than that, it doesn't even compare with it.
`Reloaded' explodes onto the screen in the most un-professional fashion. In the opening few seconds the first impression is a generally good one as Trinity is shot in a dream. Immediately after that, the film nose-dives. After a disastrous first 45 minutes, it gradually gains momentum when they enter the Matrix and the Agent Smith battle takes place. But it loses itself all speed when it reaches the 14-minute car chase sequence and gets even worse at the big groan-worthy twist at the end. Worst of all is the overlong `Zion Rave' scene. Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the plot, but it's also a pathetic excuse for porn and depressive dance music.
The bullet-time aspect of `The Matrix' was a good addition, but in `'Reloaded' they overuse to make it seem boring. In the first one there were interesting plot turns, but here it is too linear to be remotely interesting. The movie is basically, just a series of stylish diversions that prevent us from realising just how empty it really is. It works on the incorrect principle that bigger is better. It appears that `The Matrix' franchise has quickly descended into the special effects drenched misfire that other franchises such as the `Star Wars' saga have.
The acting standard is poor for the most part. The best character of course goes to Hugo Weaving's `Agent Smith'- the only one to be slightly interesting. Keanu Reeves is the definitive Neo, but in all the special effects, there is little room to make much of an impact. Academy Award Nominee Laurence Fishburne is reduced to a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue. Carrie Ann Moss' part as the action chick could have been done much better by any other actress. A poor, thrown-together movie, `The Matrix Reloaded' is a disappointment. Those who didn't like the first one are unlikely to flock to it. This one's for die-hard fans only. Even in the movie's own sub-genre of special effect bonanzas (Minority Report, The Matrix etc.) this is still rather poor. My IMDb rating: 4.5/10.","22 out of 41 found this helpful.

There are too many computer special effects. The slo-mo effect from the first one was so cool. Here, we get a computer Neo that looks so fake when fighting the many Agent Smiths. It looks like a video game.  And most of the fight scenes were boring. We know Neo can beat the agents, plus he can fly, so why would he stick around to fight a hundred of them. I'll give them credit with parts of the car chase scene mainly because the twins were so cool.  Also, when Trinity is driving the motorcycle against traffic, that was filmed so it was thrilling.But, what makes the sequel fail in comparison to the first one is the story. From the start with follow the white rabbit, the first film had me hooked. Reloaded never held my interest, especially the beginning. The whole rave in the cave was so stupid as well as Morpheus speech. And did they need the sterotypical over zealous captain who thinks he's in charge but really doesn't have the answers.  And where was all the cool stuff with somebody telling them in the Matrix where to turn and what to expect to avoid danger. And why hire a known name, Jada Pinkett Smith, when her character does nothing.FINAL VERDICT: Reloaded lost the magic and entertainment the first film had. It's like different people wrote the scripts and with a bigger budget decided computer effects would make a better film, and they were wrong.  So, if you are a big fan on the Matrix, you may not want to watch this one because it will ruin all the great things about the first one.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Kudos to the Wachowski team and John Gaeta for creating this piece of ""soon to be"" legendary work of art!While the first version was a surprise and sent our minds off orbit just like the novel ""Chariots of the Gods?"", the sequel managed to maintain the same standard if not better. The special effects are enthralling, stylish and not overly done. It simply a visual delight to watch it !The Wachowski brothers have carefully developed each character in this movie, making each of them sort like a vital part, however small their part can be. Keanu Reeves, Carrie Ann Moss and Laurence Fishburne played their parts to razor sharp precision, thanks to the beautiful direction skills and imagination of the Wachowskis.Well, with a great story, immensely brilliant idea, stylish special effects and cliff-hanger ending, The Matrix: Reloaded is already the best movie this year.

This sequel to ""The Matrix"" is bigger in many ways, bigger fights, heavier special effects and a notable larger budget. Does that mean it also is a better movie? No way! Let me start of by saying that no matter what, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" still is an awesome and spectacular movie to watch and like all the three Matrix movies, I'm glad I've seen it in the cinema. The fights are incredible and truly spectacular to watch (although, a bit fake at times). The highway sequences is a really good chase scene, on par with the ones in ""The French Connection"", ""Bullitt"" and ""Basic Instinct"" (Yes, I really feel that the chase scene in ""Basic Instinct"" is a real classic).Problem is that the Wachowski brothers tried to make this movie bigger than it was. They tried to bring a mythology kind of story into the Matrix trilogy, the result is a confusing and a not always understandable story, with lots of crazy talk that nobody seems to fully 100% understands. The first Matrix movie already wasn't exactly easy to follow at times but they have really gone to far this time with both this movie and the third one, ""The Matrix Revolutions"". I don't think anybody was waiting for a story like this, when people go and see a Matrix movie they go and see it because of the awesome and groundbreaking special effects and fights. At least I do...The worst thing about ""The Matrix Reloaded"" are most certainly the Zion scene's. They are boring and seem to drag on for ever, with the absolute low point, the whole rave/orgy scene after Morpheus speech which he did half naked by the way, for no apparent reason.Yes I really was disappointed by Morpheus appearance in this movie. In the first Matrix movie he was a Yoda kind of character, in the two sequels his character suddenly changed into a character that I just couldn't like as much as the Morpheus we got to know in ""The Matrix"".A very laughable thing is the whole Neo and Trinity relationship. Man, they really have no chemistry together on the screen and the relationship is totally unbelievable.The cast is joined by some good actors such as; Lambert Wilson, Monica Bellucci (all she does is showing her great body and looks but hey, I'm not complaining!) and Ian Bliss. There are some nice characters added such as the Merovingian and the cool twins but also some unnecessary characters that are given weak dialog and are played mostly by some horrible B-actors. Thank goodness Hugo Weaving is also still in this movie, he makes the movie really worth your time. Agent Smith still is a very cool character!All in all, compared to ""The Matrix"" a disappointing sequel mostly because of the way too complicated story. Still I recommend this movie to everyone because of all the awesome fights, special effects and nice musical score by Don Davis, it all makes ""The Matrix Reloaded"" a spectacular movie to watch, although far from a science-fiction masterpiece such as the first Matrix movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Since the original ""Matrix"" came out a few years ago everyone has imitated its' kenetic action style, which led me to think there's no way they can recapture that fresh and exciting edge again. But they did. The Wachowskis have way out done the new ""Star Wars"" films and without a doubt have far surpassed the ""X-Men films."" At times the dialogue is clunky and the Zion scenes are a little too Star Trek and Buck Rogers, but the action is always astonishing, and the humor is always in the right place...if not too much in the right place...For example Neo uses one of the many Agent Smiths to take down other Agent Smiths sending them all crashing with the sound of falling bowling pins. A little goofy but fun. The action though, I can't say enough about. The center chase scene is awesome and the opening cycle scene is....

Not to mention I have forecasted this movie to have the biggest opening weekend of all time.1 out of 2 aint bad, we'll see on Monday whether I got one right.  As far as Matrix Reloaded goes I was disappointed.  The first movie started out with confusion, what the hell is the Matrix?, but by the end of the movie even the ""not so bright people"" knew what the matrix was and what was going on. Then comes Reloaded which my first impression is that this movie is part of a trilogy and not a sequel, hence the Wachowski brothers could have taken a page from George Lucas on how to end a movie that will lead into another installment...the ""to be continue"" was like watching a mini-series, most people know that there is one more movie to come, so not everyone gasped when that ""to be continued"" came on the screen.  Regardless if I'm wrong with the whole sequel / trilogy comment, it still could've ended better.Back to movie as a whole, as much as I thought the ""partying scene"" in Zion was a little Corny, I understood that this movie was about ""life"", I get it, yet I felt like the scene carried on too long.Finally, the architect...the people that have supported this movie and have pointed the finger at the ones that didn't like it, say it's because they didn't understand it...they are 100% correct, I will admit that the architect scene threw the wrench into the machine and I derailed.  I felt like I needed to have cliff notes to follow what he was getting at, not that I was totally lost, yet this was the moment we were all waiting for in the movie and I would say that 90% of the movie theater was like, ""what the hell did he just say?""  So for all the fans that understood completely what the hell was going on at the end of that movie...kudos to you...you specialPositives: Great action sequences, yet nothing we weren't expecting considering the trailers showed quite a bit of what to expect.  I wish I could say more.  I haven't given up yet on this flick, I plan to see it again and maybe I can catch more the second time around.  I notice that this website and rottentomatoes have given this movie a helluva rating, a must see, so I sit and ponder and read what everyone has to say, and ask myself how could all of you be wrong?A great movie is for ""most people"" to follow in my opinion, but that was the magic that was missing from the second film that people saw in the first.

The Matrix ReloadedDirected by: The Wachowski Brothers, 2003This movie has been getting a bad rap and I have to join in. I wasn't that much of a fan of the original either (a 2½ rating, so imagine my solitude when everyone was raving madly about it in 1999).Keanu Reeves was poor in The Matrix. He's a really, really bad actor and the whole concept of the Matrix itself was not only dumb, it lacked simple logic and at best entertained like disarming nonsense. For a sci-fi freak like myself the basic idea was technically charming but the structure and themes were wafer-thin. Guns? Fistfights? Black leather? Suits? Too stylized, too nerdy, folks. You can tell it was written by nerds, for nerds, an ""action-utopia"" or ""perfect computer game enviroment."" To my knowledge and if I tune my future-goggles right here, hey, machines would never build something like the Matrix. On the contrary: Why cater to humans? They're all drugged and locked down anyway.But back to Matrix Reloaded. The things that worked in the first one and that I liked - the atmosphere, the larger-than-life feel on a decent budget and the impressive still-motion wire stunts (that already back then got overdone) - are missing here. Well, the 'feel' of them are. This is just the Wachowski brothers with more money. Huge fights and huge chases but no excitement. It's soulless, it's heartless. Keanu is even worse than in previous outings - yes, it's actually possible - because here he has to tackle a romance with first lady Trinity. He delivers lines so bad, so wooden, they made me laugh. Funny also, because Carrie-Anne Moss is both cool, charming and sexy but she's just kissing and staring into the face of this bland neanderthal. Sad stuff.The fights in Reloaded are way over the top. More of the same to begin with. Punch. Block. Kick. Punch. Jump. Kick. Say what? Why? Read Harry Knowles' review for more. He's completely on the money. We've seen it all before and it's idiotic. So just shoot the damn gun, alright? Oh wait, Neo can block bullets now. So why can't he block kicks and punches with a ""mindwall"" like he can bullets? Ah, the logic.Agent Smith is back for no other reason then.. well, he's back. The public wanted him. Pretty obvious. So how to bring him back from the dead.. How about we make him a computer virus? Nice one, we'll buy that, but the thrill is lacking despite Hugo Weaving's characteristic spoken drawl and sleek meanness. Furthermore, Smith manages to turn up at two pivotal junctions in the story, just after Neo has delivered crucial dialogue to either The Oracle or Morpheus. How does he do that? The third installment, Revolutions, might shed a light on that, fanboys, but it's writing based on audience reactions, not vice-versa now. Contrived populism that destroys whatever shards of integrity the original had.The grand fight scene that got all the trailer buzz - the many, many Agent Smiths against a lone Neo - made me speechless. Because I didn't care. Been there, done that. Neo will win. There is no intensity, no drama, just a retread of effects from the first one and juiced up. Then when the brawl escalated into a computer game (completely computer generated) I had to look away. I went into the kitchen and made some coffee, contemplating on how few moviemakers today have actually realized how CGI just isn't good enough yet. They want us to think so, but it's not. Talk about denial.
Later on, a freeway chase has logistics to die for. The Wachowskis actually built 1.4 mile of freeway just south of San Francisco to make this scene. That's moxy, considering how everyone else would just CGI-y it. I was psyched when this scene began hence it was maybe the kick in the face Reloaded needed. But it just doesn't resonate. I must direct people's attention to other recent movies: in Spielberg's Minority Report (that is even more CGI-drenched in its chase scenes) we cared because the story and storytelling was so good. In Terminator 3 - lesser all around to the two before it, but not as bad as we could have feared - the firetruck scene is gawking simply because there's a focus on the nitty-gritty basics of the action and struggles itself, real steel and glass, real automobiles burning rubber and colliding. In Matrix Reloaded the whole freeway slam-bam scene feels like a computer game. You know how you just always floor your car, pedal to the metal, when you play a computer game because you just don't care? It's all speed and velocity? Same thing here. Trinity, Neo and Morpheus whiz in and out of traffic, chased by agents and bad guys and there's just no tension whatsoever.That scene is a full-on free shot. That hits like a powder-puff.
Same can be said for the movie as a whole. I didn't even get to the underworld of Zion, the long pandering neo-classical religious and philosophical speeches or the two new henchmen, The Albino Twins, who - when they morph into spirits - reminded me of the effects in Poltergeist (22 years ago).
Matrix Reloaded is bad. A disappointment even for moderate fans of the first one. The program doesn't just need patches, it requires a real upgrade. Somebody call Bill Gates.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie took the great original and opened up a brave new world.  It takes such brass to do what the brothers' did. OK, yes, ""the kid"" was a stretch because of the Animatrix.  It sells, its Hollywood.  But what the Brothers are trying to do is make a whole new world, a new universe, not unlike Star Wars but with a very human feel.The first movie takes place on ONE ship!  What do the other ships do? What about Zion?  How do those people feel about their situation?  Can anyone save them from doom?  This is what makes Morpheus' speech work - pride and fear - Just like most religions.  They believe Neo is the one and how it all is handled is a very cautionary religious tale, which might be a redemption in the third movie. Now, I am not a religious person.  Not at all.  But I can see a good story. For those who thought the first movie was great, which I do too, after seeing this film the first time, I did not think it was the best movie because it veered so off from the original...but that is what makes it so great the second time.  First time around, you look for similarities to the first, the ""sequel""-ness to it. It is NOT a sequel, it is a continuation. It takes what you know and forms opinions from it, ideas from it.  The second time around watching it, you are ready for it.  AND LISTEN TO THE FIRST 40 MINUTES OF THE FILM!!! The insights and thoughts set up a great payoff - Which off course as most know, leaves a cliffhanger...but stay for the end of the credits (which are long) for a teaser for the third film.For those who felt ""cheated"" the first time he/she watched it...think how HIGH your expectations were and relax, take a deep breath, watch the film as you did the first and see it as a great continuation to a wonderful story. You know how bad The Empire Strikes Back was panned?  Why?  Because it was so darn different.  It opened up too much, it stretched, it veered, it was hard to top the original. Try this film again, with a clear mind.  It is a wonderful film.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

There are points when you wonder if you're actually supposed to understand it or whether the writers just pulled out a dictionary and looked for a lot of big words to string together, but after mulling it over a little the idea does catch on. I confess that I didn't see this movie until just yesterday, three years after it was made and the graphics are somewhat mediocre, but that really doesn't spoil the movie -- and there was only one fight scene (which went on for at least 5 mins) that I actually got bored enough in to pay attention to the graphics. The matrix reloaded is a very clever story, making one wonder about the decisions they make in every day life. And, maybe it's because I'm only 14 and have a very active imagination, but I really did enjoy this movie and the whole idea of it still phases me. So for those who like fight scenes, big psyche up talks and a load of philosophical mumbo jumbo this is the movie for you.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"7","/10","At one point, the film seems to have something to do with a machine attack on Zion, the last city of human beings, and Neo's existential doubts about his messianic mission","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5804249/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","6 June 2020","After the resounding success of the first film, which revolutionized cinema, the second part of the planned trilogy initially arrives to end the public's anxiety. The Wachowski sisters try to expand the universe in a much more risky way in dealing with the public with new conceptual additions, which are shown in action or dialogues simultaneously. Here, the aim is to expand and ""self-conscience"" the philosophical discussion, varying between the struggle as a contextual end, or an easy resolution, and particularizing humanity as a principle for transcendent reach.After defeating the machines in their initial combat, Neo (Keanu Reeves) still lives in the Nabuconodosor alongside Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Link (Harold Perrineau Jr.), the ship's new crew member. The machines are carrying out a major offensive against Zion, where 250,000 machines are excavating towards the city and can reach it in a few days. Nebuchadnezzar is summoned to return to Zion, to attend the meeting that will define the human counterattack on the machines. However, a message sent by the Oracle (Gloria Foster) causes the ship to depart again, taking Neo back to the matrix. There he discovers that he must find the Keyring (Randall Duk Kim), a being who holds the key to all paths in the matrix and who is held prisoner by Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) and his wife, Persephone (Monica Bellucci).Obviously, the films still have qualities, but it is clear here that the story took very questionable directions. The first Matrix made the right choices on the scale. Presenting a virtual world that machines use to enslave humanity while the real world is in ruins would be a lot for the public to process, so telling Neo's personal journey in this reality was a wise choice. Here, the script falls into a very common trap seen in sequels of great successes earlier, which is to try to maximize everything at the expense of the main plot. It seems that everything, necessarily, needs to be bigger and better, which results in several exaggerations. What was a concise and well-defined science fiction becoming an avalanche. Numbers, speculations, tentacles. It would be redundant to repeat this here, since the silent self-promotion of the Wachowski brothers works better, in persuasion and convincing, than the gears of a manipulative matrix. In the minds of the Wachowski sisters and producer Joel Silver, a continuation should, by digital logic, be an upgrade. Potentiated effects, more vertiginous action, multiplied beating, in addition to in-depth metaphors and symbolisms. It turns out that the result does not have the edges trimmed. There are excesses, of the most varied types.Perhaps what makes the Matrix a masterpiece is not the bullet-time, but the philosophical hints connected to the issues of the cyber world. There is no technological advance to replace an original and well-told story. In ""Matrix Reloaded"" the focus of Neo's story was removed and the protagonist was positioned as just another piece on a much larger board, the narrative lost much of its appeal. Dozens of new characters (from the city of Zion and the Matrix) come to just deliver vague dialogues and drive the script forward. Ironically, the new characters were as robotized and lacking in depth as computer programs and Neo, Trinity and Morpheus did not have enough time to develop the bows satisfactorily.
The newborn franchise then had a difficult task: to continue the plot even after the spectacular outcome, but without losing its charm. It didn't happen: the whole mystery of how the Oracle's prophecy worked, how Neo was so powerful and the fate of humanity was explained in the infamous scene of the Architect's monologue. The boring and sometimes incomprehensible explanation was a loss of immense quality, since the first film spoke deeply of philosophy and spirituality without losing its dynamics. The film's most crucial dialogue, between Neo and the Architect. In an attempt to create something rich and complex, the directors / screenwriters printed an exaggeratedly complicated language, notice how the dialogue with such a figure is full of ""difficult"" words just to complicate an idea that could be easily transmitted. Unfortunately, Neo's visit to the home of the Merovingian program (Lambert Wilson) is exceedingly long, making the feat of making a production associated with electrifying action and intriguing philosophical concepts boring and even monotonous. The pseudophilosophical speech yields 12 uninterrupted minutes. It is thought that the proposal is to support the ""seriousness"" of the film, but the content is identical to a dissertation written by a high school student who has just discovered Schopenhauer, Nietzche and Sartre. It is clear that this sequence, specifically, had the objective of linking some excellent action sequences through the streets, with trucks, cars and motorbikes, in some of the most inspired scenes in the film. Another notorious fact is the calculus of the machines, very well displayed in Matrix through the agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who is abandoned here, exchanged for eternal flourishes that end up confusing the viewer. The idea that the whole story is cyclical and that the chosen one is practically created by the machines is then lost within extensive dialogues that seek to hide its true message.
With the exception of some genuinely spectacular sequences, thanks to brand new, laborious and ingenious special effects, ""Matrix Reloaded"" is one of the most boring, pretentious and confusing films of recent times. The whole action suffers from prolonged and often unnecessary sequences. In the first film, the fighting had a certain raison d'être: they were either part of Neo's learning or they were deadly duels against the agents, seen then as unbeatable. Now, the hero fights every ten minutes. He fights (for a long time), without major consequences, with a guardian of the Oracle, with the henchmen of Merovingius, twice with the Smiths. The impression we have is that the long and didactic pseudo-philosophical scenes are just a hook to generate action scenes. Another excess is that in the first film, Morpheus was the voice of reason and hovered over the others with his teachings. Now, all the characters have something ""intelligent"" to say about freedom, faith, choice, power, free will, destiny ... Philosophy has become a fetish. Obviously, the redundancy with which catchphrases are said causes wear and tear.At one point, the film seems to have something to do with a machine attack on Zion, the last city of human beings, and Neo's existential doubts about his messianic mission. The feeling of absolute disorientation is compounded by the fact that many scenes in the film are, in reality, mere continuations of plots developed in the video game Enter the Matrix and in the Animatrix short films. An excellent marketing scam, for sure. It is clear that these action scenes remain impeccable, bringing the most modern and advanced features in the cinema at the time of its release. Neo battling a hundred replicas of Agent Smith or Trinity falling in slow motion, on his back, while fighting a duel with an agent, in addition to the long sequences of chase through the streets are undoubtedly moments of pure cinematic joy. And they are almost worth the price of admission.The visual issue ends up gaining more relevance to the detriment of philosophical issues. In terms of deepening, we started from exactly where we were left in the first film. There are no didactic efforts to remind us of each of the elements already presented, which works in favor of the narrative of the work. The journey through the rabbit hole is now much deeper, taking us not only to Zion but to the fundamental principles of the Matrix. The production design maintains the same logic established in the long predecessor and brings us, through Zion, a true amalgamation of human cultures. With a scrapped appearance, full of mechanisms that seem to have been taken from the beginning of the 20th century, this last stronghold is filled by people who look more like refugees. The Wachowski remain true to their original premise in this regard and make minorities the majority in this ""real world"", remembering that only those who are not in love with the shadows projected on it leave the cave. The sequences in Zion rescue much of the spectator's astonishment when in the first film - now we know another side of this universe, which, however dystopic, still holds hope.Of course, other aspects are explored with a lot of category. The religious side is quite accentuated. Morpheus is, more than ever, the leader blinded by belief. Neo is, more than ever, the messianic icon. And the sequence of the party watered by sensuality and electronic music in Zion is emblematic. It does not just contrast human affection versus the coldness of machines. It also suggests that the unplugged become alienated in the face of a commanding voice and respond only to the carnal desires inherent in human nature. In the refuge city, there are even power and ideological duels between ship commanders and advisers. From this perspective, the routine outside the Matrix in itself becomes potentially explosive.Shortening the plot and removing several of the supporting characters (perhaps migrating them to the acclaimed animated miniseries Animatrix) and summarizing everything in just one film would have been ideal for Matrix. The impression ""Matrix Reloaded"" leaves is that the main concern was to deliver something visually even more striking than the first film and that most of the narrative only served to prepare the audience for the final duel of men against the machines in the coming ""Matrix Revolutions "". Despite new elements, little really contributes to the advance of history, but it is still very worthwhile to follow this sequence.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","Severely under-rated - a very good follow-up","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0705494/?ref_=tt_urv","Gav_tH","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2957825/?ref_=tt_urv","8 May 2004","I recently watched this movie in sequence with the original, and it was only then when I realised the equality of the two movies. It must be said that while the first movie was a very entertaining science-fiction movie, it was in no way flawless. Pointless side-characters, over-written dialogue and slow pacing are abound, but these are brushed aside due to the strong plot that held the movie together. This time, however, people went into the movie without realising that these flaws would still be present in the sequel.Instead of taking in what they saw, expectations from the audience were simply too high. With all of the hype over the original movie, which was continually added on over the four year gap, the sequels had a lot to live up to in order to ""beat"" the original. People wanted something better than the original. And simply put, this isn't that.Instead, this is exactly more of the same, and it's because of that fact that this movie was given such bad responses.The movie is in actually very well thought out. The original had a very open-ending, but was also quite finished with in that all of the original plotlines were ""resolved"". This sequel, on the other hand, had the task of continuing this storyline without repeating the original movie - a trap many sequels fall into without creative flair. However, this movie does carry on the storyline in the most logical way - the stakes are raised immensely as things merely hinted at in the original are expanded and explained in logical detail. But here lies the problem of the Matrix sequels.The Wachowski brothers made a critical mistake in creating two movies in such a short time span. Instead of focussing on one, many storylines have been strewn throughout both movies in order to keep enough material rolling. Only one sequel should have been crafted at a time. I can't really comment on Revolutions after only one showing, but if my memory serves me well it was very weak compared to it's older brothers - it definitely does deserve the criticism it recieved, as it felt tired and uninspired. But if people had not known about a third installment, the chances are that they would have been far less critical of Reloaded. As it is, no one was sure what to make of the middle part of this trilogy.And it definitely is the middle part. It carries on the storyline from the original, but leaves itself open for the third movie. Exactly as the second Lord of the Rings movie did. But because Reloaded can't stand all that well as a stand-alone movie, that may be why so many people felt cheated. In reality, it's simply doing exactly what it says on the tin - being the second part of the trilogy.After watching in sequence with the original, it's clear neither is perfect. Both are let down by poor dialogue, awkward pacing, unnecessary philosophies (which are interesting, but could be far less overbearing), and have too many unneeded characters. There's nothing wrong here that wasn't wrong in the original - except perhaps a totally unnecessary and very terrible Xion Rave sequence, which plays out like an MTV video and features soft pornography (designed seemingly only to appeal to a modern youth demographic). Perhaps this one scene was responsible for killing enjoyment while watching in the cinema).As it is, this movie is a good follow-up. The story is carried on logically, the action is just as gripping (though fight choreography could be better at times), and the pace is consistent. Despite massive complaints about the over-the-top special effects, there is nothing wrong here - the fight scenes play out at exactly the right length. On repeated viewings, most action sequences lost their touch, but because the fights are so long here, they remain just as compelling every time through, and new details can be picked up on every time. The only exception to this rule is a Neo vs Smith fight which starts off wonderfully, but eventually ends up trying to be too ""cool"" in favour of being logical, as Neo rips a telephone pole from the ground in order to fight his nemesis. Now that was unnecessary.The effects themselves are all fantastic - the CGI flows seamlessly with the on-screen action and the lighting is simply perfect - a direct follow on to the style of the original.Taken as light entertainment, with deep undertones for those who want it, this movie is very much a triumph. Yes, it could have been better in many places, but so could the original. This movie is simply more of the same. It doesn't try to improve on the original's flaws, but really it doesn't need to. It's just the way a sequel should be.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I was VERY impressed with the movie.  The visuals were wonderful.  I measure how good a movie is by how much I think about it once I am done watching it. I've been piecing the story line together in my head.  I didn't find the movie anti-climatic.  I didn't find it below my intelligent level, in fact the more I think about it the more depressed I get.  It seems that the mere humans were just pawns in a struggle between good and evil, the good and evil of two human created, non humans.  The Architect and the Oracle. Which one was good and which was evil?  It wasn't by chance that the Architects was light skinned, and so gray as to appear all white.  His clothes were even light colored.  The Oracle on the other hand was dark skinned, dark haired, and even had a dark habit, smoking.The Architect created a world for the humans to live, love, and grow. What was the Oracle doing?  Franly, just creating chaos.  In fact so much chaos that the lives of millions of human and non humans were nearly ended.Was Neo modeled as a savior, or an anti-savior?  I guess this all turns back to ourselves.  Seldom, if ever are people pure good or evil.  Causing mass murder would be evil, right?  Well that is what Neo, and his group were doing.  Not to mention that they were working for someone that was looking to destroy it all.  Hmmmm makes you think.Two minor problems I have with the movie.  Neo was able to destroy the sentinel by his thought alone.  Where the hell did that come from?  This one aspect could have turned the movie into a interesting direction.  It was glossed over by the Oracle, but not explained in any detail.  Frankly it shouldn't be an ability outside the Matrix, hmmmm outside the Matrix...makes you think.  Secondly.  In the mech fighting exoskeletons, well bluntly, they were shooting MANY MANY more shells that was contained in those two tiny ammo packs.  One can only hope that most of the frame contained ammo, and those packs were just topping it off, yeah right.Bottom line?  Good movie.  Better than the first, for action.  Better than the second, because the second was just irritating.  The second movie was good, but I don't like being left hanging.  Go see the movie, but put your thinking cap on first.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

After such a beautifully written script for the original, I expected something as seamless for this one. Now, I enjoyed the movie, but man did it start off slow. I think the first 45 minutes could have been told in 10 and, if it had, I might not have any other complaints.Complaint 1: Diatribes. They were used to explain things in Reloaded where carefully crafted dialogue interwoven with action was used in Matrix.Complaint 2: Too many characters, not enough development. There were so many new characters thrown in the mix, it was confusing. And I know each of these characters were supposed to be rich with history. But they weren't.Complaint 3: I like sexuality when done right. But this wasn't ""sensual, sophisticated Wachowski-bros ala Bound"" sexuality. It was ""Catholic schoolboy just found out what his wee-wee does"" sexuality. It was distracting from the characters and the movie as a whole.This movie does grab you and suck you in. But by the time it sucks you in, you may have already considered leaving.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It just didn't have a good flow like the first one and resembled stop and go traffic for me.  The good parts of this movie though included the fight between Neo and Agent Smith generally referred to as the Burly Brawl.  It was one of the more fun moments in an otherwise too serious film.  Even though some of it was clearly digital I still enjoyed it.  Probably, because Hugo Weaving the actor who portrays Agent Smith seems to be just having fun with the role and isn't as stiff as most of the actors in this movie.  The actor who was the French guy and the gal playing his wife are also rather good in their roles. The freeway chase is just a nice car chase that is exciting to watch even if you hated the rest of the film.  Unfortunately these scenes may make up 20 or so minutes of the film.  The rest of the movie is poorly paced and just rather dull and anticlimactic for me.  The first 45 minutes or so aren't really worth watching at all, as it is very talky and dry.  There is also a very bad dance sequence and sex scene between Neo and Trinity, which isn't very appealing to look at.  Carrie Anne Moss just isn't attractive to me and at times I have a hard time distinguishing between her and Neo during that scene.  Quite frankly, I would rather get it on with Rebecca Romaijn Stamos in full Mystique makeup.  Keanu Reeves seems more tense in this movie, like the directors wanted him to do a flawless job.  In the first one he seemed to be having fun.  Fishburne also does a worse job.  All his lines are philosophic...I mean can't the guy talk normally every now and then. Yoda even takes a break now and again, but no matter what the circumstance Morpheus (Fishburne's character) always says something philosophical and he says it very slow.  Jada Pinkett Smith is in this one...sort of.  She adds nothing to the movie, but I here she is very featured in the video game. This is kind of stupid, as a person shouldn't have to do homework before seeing the movie.  Apparently, you have to watch those animated movies and play the game to totally understand all that is happening in the flick.  You should be able to go to a film though and just enjoy.  All in all I give this movie a 4, because of those two scenes I really enjoyed.  I won't insult anyone who liked this movie, but like I said it isn't for me.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

It's not for everyone as the idea itself is o ly for particular type of movie fans. This plot has to be followed with the plot of the first movie in mind. Some little details are linked and even few dialogs are linked and it should be watched in that way to get the 100% out of this movie. It's brilliant and I I don't understand why there's hate. This is a movie way ahead of it's time. It's still a better movie than most of the movies we got to see in 2020 which had better technology! Some of the effects are way cooler than many recent movies. Action sequences are well choreographed and has a unique style. It's not the typical action sequences we see everyday. This is still a very relevant movie even in 2021. Most underrated. This rating has occured because of confused fans in my opinion as the plot is complicated but it's well written.

Turns out the phantom menace was an atrocious mess of cgi and bad writing, same with the rest of the star wars prequels. The real sci-fi event of that year was not Lucas ego leaving a big stain in cinemas all over the world, it was a fun kung fu/anime hybrid of nerd power fantasies done right enough to engage the viewer and not make you feel that your intelligence was being insulted. It was the year of the matrix.Now move to 03, the sequel is coming, the Wachowskis had an entire generation in the palm of their hands. The could had created the biggest and most successful cult-movie franchise this world has seen since....Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. The world was full of possibilities for the matrix, everything was coming out: video game, anime, action figures and anything else you could name of. History in the making. Then Reloaded opens in cinemas everywhere, and we have another mess of bad writing, poorly directed sequences, annoying cgi and so on. A franchise permanently killed (not even the money made from the expectations helped) dozens of fans writing endless rants ""explaining"" the movie in the internet and just a bunch of people coming out completely bored out of their minds.It's not hard to see where everything goes wrong. The matrix reloaded has pretty much no reason to exist at all, just like the star wars prequels. It adds nothing to it's world, it actually destroys it. But mostly, is just a bore to watch, a huge incredible bore of a movie that will hammer your head with endless sequences of tedious fights that go nowhere, and a bunch of cgi stamped all over your face.Neo is now god/Jesus/mahoma/whatever, the whole learning process from the first movie is over. He can defeat agents with his pinky, but not just him, pretty much everyone else can do that, except of course Trinity in a atrociously placed sequence for yet another embarrassing scene of super nerd powers. Remember how dangerous the agents were in the first movie? Every encounter could mean the death of any of the characters. Not here, they're just cgi filler for all the over-long action sequences that the Wachowskis could stuff here.Remember how the first movie felt with a purpose? A clear series of objectives? Surviving the agents, protecting the location of zion, watching Neo learn about his abilities. None of that is here, there's a web of characters over a web of sub-plots over a mess of a ""core"" plot where Neo is suppose to re-start the whole matrix because the creator of the matrix made it that way. Sounds interesting? It isn't, the dialogues never once will engage you in any way possible, neither the acting, which seems to have hit rock-bottom after the fairly decent performances in the first movie. Several characters are now just filler, others fan-service (hello Mrs Bellucci) and there's just more and more stuff that never feels that it belongs there, or that is fun to watch.There's probably a long long website/blog/vlog of matrix fans answering all the ""questions"" about this and that. But when a movie boils down to a long summary of Q&A, then it's not a movie anymore. It's a fan-fic in this case, a badly written one. It's not the ""what"" but the ""how"" that really matters, even if Reloaded was speaking about great truths in this world (not the case here by the way) it does so in the most utterly juvenile, incompetent and clueless way possible. Yeah man, Neo might be the reincarnation of every single human deity into one, but he will still look goofy as hell in those clothes and flying around everywhere.It took George Lucas two decades to ruin his franchise, the Wachachachoskis did it in only 4 years. I guess this still could be worse, it could be a movie about blue furries fighting one dimensional space marines, or Indiana Jones fighting aliens.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

"","","HELP! I'm in some techno-club nightmare - get me OUT!!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2228062/?ref_=tt_urv","UNOhwen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22108743/?ref_=tt_urv","29 March 2010","THE MATRIX was an important movie, in that it was the 1st movie to usher in, and (CORRECTLY!) use the (at the time) new CGI on such a massive level.It WAS a visually breath-taking film.Due to the age-old 'bean-counters' who saw the money rolling in, they said 'hey - let's milk this 'Matrix' for as much as possible.' I'm sure that if given enough time to fully work out a coherent story that furthers the story of the first film, and expands on the CGI effects, the two subsequent films RELOADED, and REVOLUTIONS could have been something AWESOME.As it is.....they're not. Enough time's passed since these film were released to look at them NOT through rose-tinted specs, and be honest in critiquing them.One film franchise to compare the MATRIX trilogy with is the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy. Both of these film-trilogy's had similar backgrounds to work with - a large cast that was needed (for the most part) to be available for an extended filming period, and complicated stories that - while they all link together, should also be able to hold up independently. They both involved creating largely artificial worlds for their stories. These films also were made in the same part of the decade, but where one succeeds, the others falls apart. As I said - I'm speaking with that wonderful ability; HIND-SIGHT.The 2 MATRIX follow-ups continue the 1st film's story (yes, everyone's familiar with it; humanity lost a war with the machines, they're kept alive for their use of 'energy' the machines need, and some humans - realising that the world's an illusion, try to fight back).Alfred Hitchcock explained that he used a 'macguffin' to propel his stories - that is, something everyone watching the film THINKS is the MAIN point of the story, but it's really just a ruse for what's REALLY going on.I bring Hitchcock up because the latter-2 MATRIX films contain so many 'macguffins - so much padding, that if this 'fat' was trimmed off, what would be left COULDN'T sustain the 3 films, but COULD (maybe) sustain 1 LONG, or 2 films.A prime example of this padding is the infamous extended 'rave' sequence in this film. A scene that goes on far too long, and (honestly) doesn't move the story ahead. It's the film equivalent of being given a 1000-word paper to write, and after finding your short by a lot, starting to add MORE adjectives, repeating these pointless adjectives (e.g.; Mount Everest is a very, very, very, VERY tall mountain...').And where the first MATRIX film's use of 'bullet-time' caused many jaws to drop, there is no radically new/different effect in the succeeding 2 films use of CGI. I know that there are going to be many who take offence at what I'm saying - missing the whole, deep 'meaning,' but I'm NOT discussing the MESSAGE, I'm discussing HOW that message was DELIVERED.It also seems that by the time they film makers got around to making REVOLUTIONS and RELOADED, the box office on the first film being as big as it was, decided to 'amp-up' the product placements' - the eye wear especially.Many critics have said how this film is a good film for Keanu Reeves' (limited) emotional range. It's sad, but, even Keanu seems like he's wading in muck. It's cartoon acting to an extreme, and when all is said and done, both RELOADED and REVOLUTIONS will NOT be remembered as much as the first film will be.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

His ""real life"" city, Zion, is under attack by a huge number of drills and sentinels, leaving him short time to react. In the meantime, his old nemesis, Agent Smith, freed from the system, begins multiplying at a very fast rate, threatening the chosen one and his crew all over The Matrix.This sequel brings a new conflict to the world of the first film, and along with it, numerous fighting scenes, more and more complex and, of course, awesome in slow motion.

It is still a very good movie, which is to be continued in the last reenactment, leaving some suspense along the way.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I know I should appreciatespecial affects and stunts more....but what can I say....I like a decentstory.Yes, it's very entertaining, I give it that.  I just don't know,overall, if I cared about any of these characters.  It seemed so overthe top in that every other line they were saying was always alludingto....""the worst"" or ""matter of life or death""  .....ALL THE TIME!!Okay, I get it....your town is gonna be destroyed. It's a war. That'sfine.  Oh, I wonder who will win?  These characters seem to have little to no vulnerability cuz of thewhole robot thing.  Except for that cute keymaker! HE WAS MY FAVORITECHARACTER! Probably, cuz I could actually see his heart.I am just not into this kind of flick I guess.  When one or twocharacters play a terminator type character, that's one thing....BUTWHEN 90 percent of the characters are droning on in that tough-monotonous tone - SAVE THE WORLD...SAVE THE WORLD...BOMB ZION ALREADY!! I don't even care anymore.Oh yeah- when Neo fixed Trinity's heart....that just clinched it for me.ARE THESE CHARACTERS REALLY IN DANGER? I don't think so. They will allsurvive, because Hollywood loves movies that continue to make money. They wouldn't dare kill the protaganist","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So why oh why did they have to ruin them all with a piece of crap sequel that takes everything good about the first Matrix and ruins it by making it obtuse and overblown.  It's been said before, but I'll repeat it here: The Matrix Reloaded is like watching someone else play a video game.  It doesn't matter how good the game is, it's still boring to sit and watch it.
Now we fight (For 7 & 1/2 minutes against agent Smith and about four hours on the freeway) Now we talk (In convoluted psudophillisophical language that doesn't actually tell us anything.)The real difference between this movie and the original Matrix is that the original told us something about our world.  The movie had a point to make, and it was something deeper and more important than ""Hey we have millions of dollars to spend on bullet-time animation scenes and we're not afraid to use them!""Bottom line: Matrix Reloaded - see it once out of respect for the original and hope for part III, but never see it twice.  It sucks.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

"","","The Wachowskis Go Off Their Rocker","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1284568/?ref_=tt_urv","aliasanythingyouwant","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4999755/?ref_=tt_urv","31 January 2006","In the summer of '99 the Wachowski Brothers' sci-fi thriller The Matrix was the cool, sleek, sexy antidote to the dopey dinosaurism of George Lucas' Phantom Menace. Now the Wachowskis themselves have become George Lucas. The Matrix Reloaded, the further adventures of Neo, Morpheus and Trinity, is the Wachowskis laying claim to Lucas' throne by abandoning the hip, funny flair they showed in the first Matrix in favor of quasi-mythic hot-air. The film is three action scenes surrounded by some of the most show-killing, ear-abusing dialogue passages in the history of movies. When did the Wachowskis come to the conclusion that what summer movie audiences wanted was cliff-notes Camus? Did they think that by repeating the word ""causality"" over and over they could trick us into seeing their mumbo-jumbo about fate vs. free-will as anything but Philosophy 101 jive? This is what happens when hacks start taking themselves seriously. We sit down expecting kung-fu fights, cyber-rebel attitudes, iconic images of Laurence Fishburne in a black raincoat and Carrie-Anne Moss in a cat-woman outfit, but what do we get instead? A bad French actor rambling on for hours like Sartre if Sartre had had the IQ of a toenail clipping.This is too bad, because one wants to enjoy the movie. Keanu Reeves is an actor who, despite his inadequacies, has the kind of good-humored, dogged way about him that melts cynicism, except you'd never know it by his joyless, immobile performance here. In Reloaded his character, Neo, has advanced beyond Jedi-apprentice status to full-Jedi, and like Luke Skywalker, power has made Neo a bore. He flies through the sprawling Matrix-city like Superman as dressed by Gaultier; he has portentous dreams about his lover Trinity dying; he fights a thousand Hugo Weavings without once losing his shades. This should be a hoot but isn't. Even during the epic battle with the army of Smith-clones, a slapstick CGI bonanza, the film seems labored and over-serious. The Wachowskis seem to be feeling the pressure of expectations. They want to elevate their story to Dune/Lord of the Rings status, to out-Lucas Lucas, and in doing so totally eliminate the semi-comic, subversive undertones that made the first Matrix amusing. They've become stiffs. The images of Reeves, Fishburne and Moss looking dour and pale - futuristic warriors as ticked-off photophobes - are no longer funny, they're just big and dead, and the whole plot about the fate of Zion and rescuing the keymaster (maybe they should've called Pete Venkman and Egon Spengler in on that one) seems like an act of desperation.The Wachowskis still know how to orchestrate an action scene, but it's a measure of their failure as storytellers that you think of the action in terms of orchestration instead of just enjoying the thrills. The film provides oodles of material for connoisseurs of wire-work, CGI and slow-mo car-crashes; unfortunately it also satisfies those who relish bad dialogue and listless acting. The single-worst scene must be Fishburne's Paul Atreides speech in front of the assembled population of Zion and the subsequent orgy. The Wachowskis are grabbing for respect here from the kind of people who think fiction starts with Tolkein and ends with Herbert. Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings films must've intimidated the Wachowskis; they must have thought they had to go for more of an epic and leave behind the rebel-hacker material that supplied the heart of the first Matrix. The sort of silly, pseudo-profound idea that can lend a bit of weight to a sci-fi story has become the purpose of The Matrix Reloaded; the Wachowskis have turned themselves into preachers of some kind of clueless gospel. And only a couple of world-class twerps would make us sit through such a tedious lecture of a movie only to stick us with a cliffhanger. To be continued? Who cares?","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Matrix: Reloaded continues the legacy of incredible action sequences; however, the storytelling has suffered over these years. In the previous film, action complimented the ideas the plot needed explained; the notion of matrix reality vs. actual reality was enforced greatly thanks to fights that culminated in short lines (""You think that's air your breathing?""). Reloaded faces the challenge of developing new ideas about the matrix as well as the reality outside it. Unfortunately, explanations come and come and come...Long conversations and speeches seem independent of the action in the film, and, as a result, the film has an odd pacing which contrasts greatly from the constant adrenaline rush of the first. I felt I needed a flowchart to fully grasp the characters and their places in this story. The confusing and tedious storytelling aside, the plot continues to be intriguing and I anticipate the third installment. The following of the first will guarantee this saga success, despite some problems.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You have Zion, there's Bane, there's the Architect. And my favorites the Oracle, and the Keymaker. The Keymaker was the main player in the movie. Making the keys, and helping out our heroes. The best thing about this movie are those villainous twins who go from solid to intangible during the fight. General Motors played a great deal with their Cadillacs especially the SUV that the twins drove. Too bad that they weren't fire proof. Morpheus was very wicked with the Katana. And that collision scene with the two semis was kinda awesome in a way. Too bad the drivers weren't playing chicken. And fighting off the multiple Smiths is no picnic either, but keeping him from prevailing is a must in order to find peace in both worlds.

I had just seen Dark City, a truly intelligent film. A couple of years later I had to rent Matrix because my girlfriend had missed it and this time I finally realized that Matrix was a great action film and truly entertaining. It may even be called innovative. So I had some hopes for Reloaded.I realize that the Wachowski brothers felt the need to explain their universe in this film. I also realize that they had an need for trying to explain the motives of the main characters but still. Reloaded has some great action and amazing effects but it is also an extremely uneven film. It felt like at least half of the film was made up of endless and pointless monologues, (Morpheus was worst, talk about pretentious.)I also have a huge problem with this kind of parodichal acting, especially when you have a corny dialogue. And believe me, it really is corny.I have a degree in philosophy and always find the kind of fake philosophy that Reloaded represents as a bit naive and funny. But one wonders why they made such a fuss about the philosophical aspects of the story when it is clearly made to entertain teenagers? The 16 year old I went to see Reloaded with simply didn´t have a clue what they where talking about. And when it comes to alienating your audience, that might be the worst thing you can do.And when it comes to suspense, how exciting is it with an character, Neo in this case, who simply can´t lose? And in this film he really is the Matrix version of Superman. I have to say that my expectations are considerably lower for the next outing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's a layered and very well made Sci-Fi epic that can very well be a good sequel but saying it surpasses the earth smattering, ground breaking original is a little out of this world. Oh wait! That's exactly what these films are.The Matrix: Reloaded is exceptional well crafted and blended Science fiction adventure it brings more to the table this time than the first one and with a bigger and more grand style it serves up course after course of mind bending twists, out of this world action and more ground breaking special effects than the first film. This movie is not as philosophical as which is something that made the first so enjoyable ad good, instead Reloaded somewhat discards of the preachy moments of the first film and focuses more on the action and the thrills, which is good and all but that sometimes does not make a movie. No what made this series great was it's dark under tones and malicious story between deceit and truth and the line that sometimes that can get blurred along the way. But is Reloaded a bad movie? No way! Is it a good sequel to the The Matrix? Most definitely. Doe sit live up to the first? Heck yeah!! SO what is it that makes a great movie? Well if you've seen The Matrix and The Matrix: Reloaded than you've seen great film making on a rare and near-grand scale. It bust off the screen in an almost three dimensional style that can't be match or copied for that matter, The Matrix: Reloaded blew all the competition away at the 2003 box office and set a new standard for movie sequel excellence and the way it should be done. It's powerful and brilliant and an ingenious machine that ticks along, slowly counting down the minutes to the end. But honestly if your watching this film will you even care about time? Or anything around you for that matter? No you'll be too caught up in the extravagance and mind boggling splendor of this movie.Keanu Reeves turns in an adequate performance in this sequel to his super star making role in the first film. He brings more to the table than the first time around and makes the movie oh so much more better than if he wasn't in it. Carrie-Anne Moss was the only let down in this film in the first she was fantastic in this she was dragging herself just trying to keep up with Reeves and Fishburne, Fishburne was also a little stale in this film he doesn't give off the same fascination and vibe that made it so great in the first. But none the less Fishburne holds his own and comes out on top, Hugo Weaving(who I know have great respect for) keeps the same power and intensity that he had in the first film and he raises the bar in this one and goes all in with all two billion of him bring the fight to NEO's doorstep.It's a wild and insanely fun ride that can't be missed or ignored, it's great fun for anyone with a heart for complex stories and mind bending plot twist. This film delivers more and more each time you watch it and each time you feel differently. It's a great film with a great vibe with amazing eye opening special effects. Its great for anyone in the mood for a good time then look no further than the Matrix: Reloaded it'd your guide to wild, insane and out of this world fun. The Matrix Reloaded delivers.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Well, if you don't know what I'm talking about, that feeling where you look at things with more focus... study people around you... and wponder if you yourself could actually be in a matrix.  Whenever a movie makes me leave the theatre feeling (not just blown away) but impacted in a way only that movie could have impacted me... it did something right. (for example, Goodfellas left me talking in Italian mob style for a few minutes...).Matrix definetly did this for me... again.  Although some of my friends were a bit dissapointed, I got that same 'feeling' as before.  I think it works as a very good sequel, and gave me the same mind-f%#! as before.There are a few things I left the theatre wondering about, and I cannot say them here cause I don't want to ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen this yet. But where are the boudaries of the Matrix I wonder?  And that guy with the knife... what about him?Obviously since this movie is such a cliffhanger, you have to give thumbs up to the fact the 3rd one will be released in just six months.

It's only an excuse to pack a 2,5 hour movie with special effects, fighting scenes and action. Did the team behind this time-waster have too much money and not enough ideas, perhaps? I absolutely think so. Not only that, but this joke of a sequel is extremely annoying and monotonous too. To quote the Godfather of Soul, James Brown, it's ""just talking loud and saying nothing"". It's a poor excuse for a movie, and those responsible should have known better, done better and tried harder.

Everything feels synthetic and artificial. The sets feel very much like sets, and the over-use of CGI doesn't help either. It's amazing that the effects actually can get worse with a bigger budget and better technology. The actors look tired and bored, the exception being Weaving's deliciously deranged Agent Smith, who is the only one that manages to liven up things in between the endless talk, talk, talk ... Why they felt the need to throw in about a dozen new characters not to care about, is a mystery to me.The only redeeming features are the Burly Brawl (unrealistic, yet so spaced out I couldn't help liking it), and parts of the car chase sequence.After the initial viewing, I checked the Internet for theories as to what was going on. Of course, there were a thousand different takes on the film, all claiming to have found a message somewhere in it. Well, I still think it's a pile of rubbish. Reloaded still doesn't make an iota of sense considering everything that happened in the first Matrix. Whether the Wachowskis just got lucky with the first part of their ""trilogy"", or if the studio wisely managed to delete the worst parts - I don't know. I do know that Reloaded is nothing more than a money-making machine, disguised as a movie with an important philosophical/religious message (read mumbo-jumbo).By cleverly throwing in a barrage of existential references, the WB's make sure that people can have their own theory about what is happening. There is no right or wrong, simply because there is no real story here. The only evident message is see the film, watch the nine animated shorts, play the video game, visit our website, bow down in front of Mammon, and then you'll know what it is all about.

Sorry, But I don't feel I need to.  I have heard from people I know and reviewers that this movie did not live up to the original.  Let me just say that that is completely FALSE! I never put stuff in all caps.  I swear.  This movie was and is phenomenal. It upped the ante bigtime!  No new special effects?  What?!  Screw the special effects!  Before I say that, I should say that the special effects were amazingly different, but that's not why I am so psyched about this movie (I'll get into special effects later, SOOO second on why this movie is so good).  This chapter introduced a level to the story that smackingly amazing to me.  The first movie was about discovering.  By that I mean Neo discovered what was there.  This movie was about understanding, and about how that perception of understanding leads to a more important concept of what that understanding entails.  I haven't seen the third movie yet.  I will see it tomorrow.  Not important right now.  Right now I am writing not to try to sway the other tens of thousands of reviewers, but because I had to, I figured IMDB.com was the best place to tell as many people as I could why I loved this movie.  Damn, I'm gonna be long-winded... oh well.So at the end of the first one, Neo accepts that he has a role to play. I'm not gonna get into why that one was great, lots of people thought it was (perhaps for technical/mass-appeal reasons rather than philosophical ones, but whatever).  Reloaded was not a sequel, it was a continuation - difference being that it was not the same story in a different setting, it is the next step.  There is obviously a lot that happened between the first movie and Reloaded.  Maybe Animatrix or the video game filled that in, but I haven't experienced either.  Still, work had been done, and they are at a turning point, which involves the survival of Zion, but I'm not gonna get into how or why, just in case anybody with enough time to read this hasn't seen the movie yet.  Anyway, the story evolves, as some might have heard, with the notions of love and choice and causality.  There are old characters in the same light as the last film, old characters cast in a new light, and new characters with a new light altogether.  The story evolves, that is what is important. And the significance of this evolution is what makes this movie so great.Technically speaking, some people wanted another Bullet-time-like advance in the special effects.  There was, though the obviousness might not have been as visually different from the first movie from its predecessors.  There are scenes here that have never been done before, just as the bullet-time wasn't done before, only more subtle in that the effects don't involve a visual change (i.e. characters on a screen), but a technological one (i.e. what those characters are and can do).  So difficult, but perhaps easy to underappreciate. Rest assured, try to compare the technical aspects of the movie, and you will be hard pressed to find an equal.While watching this movie, either for the first time or again, think about the evolution in skills and in opponents.  Both have risen in scope and intensity.  In the story, think also about scope and intensity - both have increased significantly.  Face value is nice, really nice, but the beauty lies beyond.  If you don't see it, this review may not help you to.  But rest assured, it is there.  The question is always more important than the answer.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is a film that not only had to hold it's own as a summer action flick but also had the immeasurably difficult task of living up to perhaps the most celebrated sci-fi action flick of all time. Did we really expect a film as good as the MAtrix?But then I think to myself, on the other hand, did the Wachowski's HAVE to make another Matrix film? The answer is no and I no longer feel sorry for all the flak they have taken for tarnishing the once untouchable name of the Matrix. I hope for their sake that Revolutions is not only a fantastic movie in it's own right but also manages to make everyone think twice about Reloaded. I for one am not so sure the Wachowski's will be able to pull this off but I could be wrong.As if the odds against it weren't enough Reloaded had similar unlucky fate as Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones; It was released two weeks after a Marvel film that garnered considerably better reviews than it. While Reloaded still managed to pull in more money than X2 (though the gap ($60 million) was not as large as experts had guessed) it's critical success was not as good. Unfortunately, it wasn't just the critics; movie-goers just seemed to enjoy X2 more. As if this wasn't bad enough an EVEN BETTER film came out a couple of weeks after Reloaded. This one was even a kids' film. Finding Nemo officially dethroned Reloaded as the 2003 summer king both by getting better reviews AND by making more money. Dethroned by a kids' film that no one had predicted would make more money, the Wachowskis may have made a whole load of money but have also suffered heavy embarrassment. They also have to live with the knowledge that because of all the negativity, revolutions will neither have as big an opening weekend, nor will it make as much money in the long run.So this of course all means Reloaded is a bad film? Well... no. It's actually pretty good. Unfortunately it isn't it's The Matrix. It tries so so hard to be it's predecessor but it's not. Director Joel Silver said this film raised the bar to unimaginable levels. However there are no special effects in this film that we have not seen used in a whole bunch of films before. Just where does the bar get raised, Joel? When Neo fights the hundredth Smith? When we see a bullet time effect for like the ten millionth time? The most exciting scene in the movie is the car chase scene and despite all the hype, people were more excited at the Nightcrawler scene in X2, a scene that the filmmakers of X2 did not hype at all. This is a good example of hype coming back to haunt a film. Someone should tell film makers that the last thing they want to do is hype a scene in their own movie cos if the audience do not feel the same way, they're screwed.The action scenes in Reloaded are top notch however and you can see a lot of time and effort has been put into them but there is one major problem...we've seen it all before. Unlike the first Matrix, where the viewer came out thinking ""Wow, what the hell was that? How did they do that?"" you just sort of sit there thinking ""Oh. That again."" and ""bullet-time again"". The only new cool action sequence is Neo flying (even if it is a bit too CGI-filled).One of the most celebrated things about the Matrix was the philosophical aspect of it. I always had mixed feelings about this aspect. While the film was certainly more clever than your everyday run of the mill action flick, I'm afraid it wasn't Aristotle either. The ""philosophy"" in that film was rather shallow and very uncomplicated for obvious reasons. While I do not think that this was one of the Wachowskis' intentions, this aspect of the film ended up being probably the most talked about. For this reason Andy and Larry decided to amp it all up for Reloaded. This is where this film's main fault arrives. Given the plot of this film, there is literally no further philosophy than was in the first film but Andy and Larry have decided, rather than inserting real philosophy into the film, to only pretend to do so. The result is a number of the characters in the film saying normal things in stressfully complicated ways. This is nothing more than a cheap and low shot by the Wachowskis aimed at the less knowledgeable of Matrix fans. I find this to be the one thing about Reloaded that I cannot forgive. There are few things worse than being pretentious. If all you've got for us is a brainless summer blockbuster, then admit it. Don't try to fool people into thinking there is more than meets the eye to the film.The unfortunate result of this is a lot of Matrix fans telling everyone that they did not get the film. If someone says this to you, be sure to ask them exactly what it is that you didn't get and watch them falter or say something ridiculous like ""you have to find out for yourself"". Accept everything in this film at face value. There is nothing subtle ot remotely sublime about it.Overall Reloaded is a good action movie to watch if you want to see some good old fashioned butt-kicking and great special effects but if you're looking for an intelligent film, watch Adaptation or City of God.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'm much too familiar with Philip K. Dick, Robert Anton Wilson, Grant Morrison's mind-blowing comics ""The Invisibles"" and the other source material that inspired it to think that the Wachowski brothers are innovative thinkers. Now I'd avoided 'The Matrix Reloaded' until now because I'd been warned that it was a major disappointment, but I finally relented and watched it... Boy, BIG MISTAKE! I could never have guessed how terrible this was going to be. Easily the poorest sequel in recent memory. I can't think of ONE thing I liked about it. The three main characters from the original bored the crap out of me, all the new ones introduced were even LESS interesting, and the whole Zion thing, well, I couldn't care less what happened to these people. On top of that you have some of the most stilted and nonsensical dialogue you'll ever hear and I'm sick of saying this but it's true - CGI SUCKS! The two ""big"" set pieces, the car chase and the fight with multiple Agent Smiths, were just SO boring to me... If you want to see REAL excitement just compare the latter sequence to the Crazy 88 fight in 'Kill Bill'. I'm sorry I thought 'The Matrix Reloaded' was AWFUL. As I said, I think the first movie was overrated but it was still entertaining, and at least it had some ENERGY. But this! I had to force myself to sit through it until the end.

Reloaded has a lot of surprises and it definitley holds your attention until the end.  Neo and Trinity seemed to have more scenes and more fighting in this film.  I give Reloaded a 7 out of 10.

Hence, my enjoyment for most chop socky Jackie Chan style movies. Wide open camera shots (with very few camera angle changes), Clean, clear, and focused... and plenty of light to see the realistic action. (hmmmm Like the first matrix movie!) That and that alone makes for a good fight sequence. If you have close cut, quick camera changes, in low light you might as well be making Daredevil. This movie has two things that made me almost dislike it. That weird green tint to everything.. (What the hell? Filters.. such a Soderbergh thing to do......) And the silly amount of CGI.  Remember all of the great action movies when we were kids... Superman, indiana jones, terminator, Jaws, etc.. NO CGI.. remember the horrid CGI movies.. Anaconda, The queer surfing scene in the new James Bond.. and now Matrix Reloaded. if you like CGI that looks like cgi..

Almost.Unfortunately, it takes nearly half-an-hour into the movie before any real plot is developed that the audience wishes things would kick into gear again.  The first movie relied on initial force and story to draw attention. There were a few bullet-time scenes that made it interesting, but it remained fairly straightforward.In ""Reloaded"" there is bullet-time and slow-motion galore.  Too much in fact.  Also, the plot and effects in themselves get to the ridiculously overblown stage by the last 30 minutes.  Pity.  The action itself leaves something to be desired.  After the umpteenth judo battle began, I realized just how annoying it was getting.  The fight on the tractor trailer was just too long for this reviewer's taste.I don't mean to criticize the Wachowski Bros. because they have literally put their heart and soul into these movie, but the editing this time around is just awful.  Even the wondrous sound uses in the first ""Matrix"" feel like they've been skimped on this time.Overall, just not as good this time around; a lot like ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"" when put in the original context.  3 out of 5.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Secondly I thought that all the new secondary characters were far more interesting than the secondary characters in the last film, none of whom made any type of impression on me. The acting was all good but I still find Keanu Reeves quite wooden in these films, even if this one was a bit of an improvement over the first one. It felt like this film was a natural continuation of the first film, ramping up the stakes and improving the lore around Zion.

People don't go to see a Matrix movie expecting high art.  They expect to see action:  chases, fights, explosions, etc.  To that extent, Matrix II delivers.  But there is more here to think about. 
The Matrix movies are presenting the philosophical conundrum:  what if everything we think we see is not actually ""real""?  In Matrix I, we are exposed to the idea that the mundane daily experience is actually a shared illusion created by machines who are using the biochemical energy of humans, and keeping their minds busy while doing so.  This sci-fi explanation seemed laughable at the time (surely there must be a better way to generate energy), but Matrix II starts to go in a new direction that makes the first explanation more palatable, though it itself leaves one waiting for the third film.  The barriers between the Matrix and the ""real world"" start to collapse in Matrix II - and the implications are quite interesting to consider.The acting in Matrix II is solid.  Fishburne is dominating as Morpheus, Reeves is at his best with the kind of understated character he has here, and Carrie-Anne Moss is quite good, also.  Hugo Weaving is starting to grow on me as Agent Smith, who in this version has broken free of the Matrix structure and has become an independent agent, so to speak. 
For a long section of the movie, our heroes are on a quest to track down the ""Keymaker"".  It is very hard not to think of Rick Moranis barking like a dog in Central Park when this happens!  The action sequences in the middle of the film are the best, with notable performances by a pair of albino dreadlocked matrix wraiths. Finally, one point I liked, and which I'm stunned to find criticized by another reviewer, is that a relatively large proportion of the main characters are black.  This is somehow offensive?  I found it noteworthy, and I liked it.  Why must we always assume that sci-fi populations demographically resemble a Connecticut suburb?  The great thing about the racial melange in Matrix II is that it is not mentioned at all.  They are not trumpeting ""hey, look at us, we're mutli-cultural!""  They seem to not care about race at all.  Isn't this a good thing?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And it did. Of course the action scenes are overwhelming and never seen anywhere before, but it is just too much. After five minutes we've seen all the kung-fu moves there are. Why the **** do they all fight like Bruce-Lee? If Neo can stop bullets with his hands, he has such a great momentum in his arms/hands that he should be able to erase a person with a single blow of his arm. And not be fighting for minutes. The whole movie thrives on two action scenes, of which the last is, though cinematic-technically brilliant, stupid. Why would they chase each other in cars if, for example, the 'ghost twins' can fly. I mean there are a lot of these inconsequent things ( it is a matrix, a visualisation of numbers in which every move and position can be predicted, so there is no need to chase or fight each other, the outcome is already known). But overall,  I enjoyed the last hour of the film most and there are some nice ideas displayed. I like the corridor with 'back doors' idea.  The first 30 minutes are sometimes toe-bending (what is that in english?) I mean very sh**ty. Like the pseudo-psychological nonsense of Morpheus and that whole Zion party that looked like one big 'Bacardi commercial.'","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The piece seems to demonstrate a total lack of understanding as to what made 'The Matrix (1999)' such a success, and a downright classic, to begin with. It has long stretches of dull, exposition-filled down-time that only serve to give us more time with the picture's lifeless, close to unrecognisable characters and to bombard us with overly complex, somewhat self-aggrandising world-building. A large portion of the piece is dedicated to a bizarre sort of pseudo psychology and school-grade philosophy lessons disguised as science-fiction. This wouldn't be a bad thing if it was entertaining, but it's just a bit boring and almost comes across as pretentious. The affair's saving grace is its action. It's incredibly ambitious and, generally speaking, it's nearly as well-achieved as some of the stuff in its predecessor. The highlight is certainly a memorable, ever-escalating highway chase sequence. Still, a lot of the action isn't all that compelling. It gets a bit too big for its own good, so much so that you no longer believe that the heroes are actually doing the things you're seeing them do. As such, there's never really an appropriate sense of danger. When things get too carried away, the use of intangible, fully CG body doubles remove all sense of plausibility from the piece. Plus, the stakes are mitigated quite a bit by the fact that the lead, after his arc in the prior movie, is essentially an invulnerable superhero when he is plugged in to the matrix, able to do whatever he so desires. In the end, the movie just doesn't have any real impact. It doesn't seem to go anywhere and its few interesting ideas come far too late - and are far too poorly explained - to hold any real weight. It does have some accomplished action and it keeps you relatively engaged for its majority. However, it isn't particularly compelling or exciting. It's a far cry from its predecessor. 5/10","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The story picks up several months after its predecessor and Keanu Reeves is having recurring dreams of Carrie-Anne Moss' death. Laurence Fishburne and the two aforementioned players go to Zion (which was talked about the entire first film, but never seen) and we get greater insight to what remains of the human race. It appears that the Controllers (led by Hugo Weaving who has also struck gold in ""The Lord of the Rings"" series) are about to attack Zion within three days and try to eliminate the few humans that remain. Thus the clock is ticking on Reeves and company as they try to stem the tide and possibly end the war for good. Unfortunately the Controllers have gained strength as Weaving is now able to duplicate himself endlessly. Twists and turns aplenty are in ""The Matrix Reloaded"" and the only real solution in the end is a bridge to get us to the third entry in the series. The second chapter in the trilogy is a little better than the first (I was not a huge fan of the first film). It widens its scope and it explains a few things that were hard to comprehend in the initial installment. The introduction of several new characters (Jada Pinkett-Smith and the illuminating Monica Belluci in the roles) ends up adding new dimensions that I would have never been able to predict beforehand. There is lots more action as well. I found the first chapter way too talkative and a bit dull in many areas. This movie still suffers from some dull moments (the screenplay's dialogue is questionable at best), but the action sequences are mind-blowing to say the least. The special effects and editing techniques are even better than the Oscar-winning ones from its predecessor. When all is said and done though ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is still not a total triumph with me. I remarked that the first film was ""as empty and meaningless as a painting by Picasso"". Admittedly I don't quite feel that strongly now after seeing this film. The first movie makes a lot more sense to me and I have a little more insight into what the Wachowski Brothers are trying to say here (the directors/co-writers). With that said I think the ideas in ""The Matrix"" are a wide jumble that never do come together in a cohesive manner. In this series there are undertones of Biblical teaching, Greek philosophy, science-fiction story-telling and an almost endless number of elements from varying cultures around the world. When put together the experience is more migraine-inducing than it is interesting. ""The Matrix"" series lacks everything that the recent ""The Lord of the Rings"" series has. ""The Lord of the Rings"" has a focus that keeps its audience interested and intrigued. It has a heart, mind and soul that put it above most other productions of the genre. ""The Matrix"" has a better mind than I originally thought it had, but its heart and soul are still nowhere to be found. The series is very cold, sterile and at times a trial to get through. I am anxious to see how this series concludes, but in the end I am not sure I will care any more or less about ""The Matrix"" and that makes it only average when it finally completes its long schizophrenic journey. 2.5 out of 5 stars.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie itself is like a poem and if don't get then your critique is pointless and illogical. The special affects can never be questioned and the chase scene was beyond measure.I like the matrix because it makes me think, there is nothing worse to a moviegoer than to leave the theatre with no recollection of the movie he just saw.

It was entertaining and loud and visually brilliant, but it's plot was meaningless. It seemed vacuous in its reliance on 'fate' and 'destiny'. All the reviewers loved it though. They decided all that fate and destiny was intelligent.The Matrix Reloaded I LOVE. Adore. Worship. It is genius. We see Morpheus not as the Obi-Wan po-faced mystic as in the first film, but Morpheus the blinkered, egocentric new-ager unable to see reality. Elements of the Matrix itself that were seen as unexplainable mysticism in the first (because the first film is filtered through Morpheus) are now explained and the concept suddenly seems intelligent to me where it didn't before.But I'm an IT geek; a nerd with a toehold on the subject that the Wachowski's here provide brilliant and entertaining metaphor for. The plethora of negative reviews for this film complain it is MORE mystical and up its arse than the first; that there is far LESS plot than the first. Such fat, balding middle aged cretins should not be allowed to review this film, because they are unable to see that it has far MORE plot than the first; the subtleties of the IT characterisations here made the geek in me laugh out loud. Negative reviewers listen too closely to Morpheus - yes he spouts gibberish mysticism, THAT'S THE POINT DULLARDS. He's a mad man.There is plenty to entertain here. The action sequences truly are like nothing seen before, even if the larger fight sequences are a little too 'animated'. The film could well do without the ridiculous post watershed music video sequence in Zion (you'll know it when you see it), but you'll have forgotten that by the time you reach the end and the final twist in the machine humanity battle leaves you eager to learn what new evolution this series will lead to. The first film was gamers. The second film is hackers. The geek army can't wait for what the third will bring.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This film is not only inferior in almost every way save special effects from the original, the mythology of the series is possibly irredeemably destroyed by the confusing, non-sensical ending.Yes there is eye candy galore.  If the Matrix was a Hershey Bar, Matrix Reloaded is Swiss Truffles.  The 3 major fight scenes - Neo vs. 100 Smiths, the Freeway chase and the Foyer fight, which account for perhaps over 1/2 the films run time, are worth the price of admission alone.  The penalty for seeing these amazing effects on the big screen though is the other 1/2.  The non-action scenes are truly gawd-awful, especially the 7 minute rave sequence in Zion where the directors suddenly decided they were filming a techno music video (and a very dull one at that).Every from the dialogue and pacing to the locations and music is merely a pale reflection of the original.  Matrix reloaded comes across more like a remake by people with less inspiration but more money.Let's hope the 3rd one can redeem this disaster and restore the mythology this one destroyed.Matrix provided intelligent philosophical ponderings on the nature of reality and freedom while interspersing fantastic fight scenes.  Matrix Reloaded interrupts it's mind-boggling fight scenes for ponderous and contradictory dialogue that tries to be philosophical but most often sounds forced and out of place, now trying to incorporate the nature of an artificial reality into it's overall philosophy, but doing it very childishly.If all you want are the great fights, go see this film, just be prepared to pay the price for that devotion.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Its strengths lie in developing the world of the Matrix itself, as Neo looks to understand his role and issues of fate and free will are again front and centre. The film also continues to develop the action that the original was known for, culminating with a sustained action sequence that moves across different locations and takes in fights, chases and gun battles that are brilliantly choreographed and edited. It's a shame then that for all the positives of developing the world of the Matrix, the less said about the world of Zion and the ""real"" world the better. It is here where the film's pacing becomes problematic and the characters introduced are barely realized and largely uninteresting. Plot beats in this world are rushed and it becomes difficult to care about anyone outside the core trio of Trinity, Neo and Morpheus. It's a flaw that becomes even more problematic in the next film, but here with the focus on the Matrix itself, these flaws don't quite negate the films strengths.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's not as good as its predecessor, but it is still an entertaining movie. In it we have the first trio, Neo, a slightly heavier Morpheus, Trinity and Agent Smith. However where The Matrix WAS tight and COOLLY ferocious,this one is nowhere near it. The soundtrack is bland and there are too many scenes of Zion for my taste, the love scene is too contrived,(Neo & Trinity nude interspersed with scenes of Zionites writhing and dancing in slow motion)and Jada Pinkett's Niobe seemed to be thrown in just to extend the cast and nothing more. The best parts of the movie are the fights, in particular the ones between Neo and the multiple Mr. Smiths and Trinity's car and motorcycle chase on the freeway. Perhaps the last of the trilogy will satisfy any deficits in this one. I surely hope so.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And since there's not too much of a story-line to interest viewers it becomes just a matter of waiting to go from one action scene to the other. And at that, one of the longest scenes in the film is a fight on top of one extremely loooong truck speeding full throttle along one of L.A.'s murderous freeways which seems to last hours instead of the normal minutes!

Now, most people would have said that a Matrix basher would not get the story or something. But now people have become more wise about the story from the first Matrix movie. But people still don't get the flair of this trilogy. It isn't just some MACHINES REVOLTING AND TAKING OVER THE WORLD ploy like so many other movies. There is more meaning and psychology to this trilogy than any other science fiction movie ever. I don't know the reason why people compare this beautiful trilogy to Star Wars. I just thought Star Wars was a copy of Star Trek and was boring to me. ""LUKE I AM YOUR FATHER"" must have been the only worthwhile dialogue in the whole StarWars legacy. The Matrix is already being hailed as the best science-fiction, fantasy movie trilogy ever. I have watched Lord of the Rings and I have absolutely no reason why it's any good. The only part I must have liked in their whole trilogy is the first scene in the first movie when they show how the Ring has been passed down generations. Back to the Matrix. The philosophies are clearly very complex and mindbending. The Wachowskis definitely have a vision and they must have read many books to get this knowledge. Even though the first movie was stupendously mindblowing and a very deep storyline so did the second movie. The story might look very weak but actually it is quite strong. It is a progressive story instead of the hard hitting story for the first movie. The brothers intelligently made the second movie to follow on from such a classic that it didn't even feel like a repeat of the effects and action sequences. Clearly, the freeway chase scene blew me away. And I don't know what people have against cgi being used in the 100 agent fight but i thought it was stunning. The fighting choreography must have taken years to get right cause it was crazy to do. Poor Neo, had to do all those moves. Other movies you can clearly identify cgi stuff but in the matrix movies you just can't. The ZION city looks ultra cool and the sentinels look as creepy as ever. One thing though, the Architect speech was a very spectacular twist. I don;t know how the Architect memorized all that beautiful ranting about anomalies and human errors but it was very jaw dropping. The brothers seemed to write every detail into that speech and made it very involving. Now I love cgi only if it's nice so I loved when Neo burst out of the room and broke everything in his way. Fire explosions from the building, glasses shattering. Cars smashing and flying. The cinematography was very good. The fight scenes didn't just look like actors doing moves and the camera moving in one way. The camera was going in all angles and directions. The zooming of buildings as Neo is flying to save Morpheus. Oh yeah and the monumental scene in which Trinity falls. The brothers tried to show this scene like in the first movie when she runs from the agent. Very awesome scene. And did anyone notice how door numbers played an ultra huge role in both movies. I won't go in detail about which door did what and what were the consequences. There's still a lot of philosophy going on about the Architect's speech. Simply put the BEST SEQUEL for a movie in the longest of times and obviously the BEST MOVIE TRILOGY EVER!!!! 2003 IS THE YEAR OF THE MATRIX.

I should have known better then to expect Keanu Reeves to have another good film.  It seemed to me that the movie was out to prove that it's fight scenes would bigger and better than first Matrix. But in doing so the filmmakers gave no consideration to the substance of storyline. For those of you fortunate souls who have yet see Matrix Reloaded, count your blessings and move on.If you don't believe me I'll give you an example of the ridiculous storyline. Apparently there are VAMPIRES and WEREWOLFS in the Matrix. OH YES I forgot to mention GHOSTS. Here are some other major flaws with the film:1. At the end of the first film Neo was invincible, now he is back fighting when doesn't even really need to fight? (According to Morpheus in the first film) The Guy can stop bullets and fly but he still needs to trade punches.2. Apparently everyone in Zion took a course in Agent fighting 101 from Neo, because they all go toe to toe with agents. In one scene Morpheus is helping Neo take on like twenty Agent Smiths. If my memory serves me correctly Morpheus couldn't take care of one in the first Matrix.
Things that could have save this Film1. Limit Keanu Reeves's dialogue to sentences like ""I Know Kung-Fu""2. Kill the Malcolm X speech by Morpheus.3. Limit the Number of exploding cars that tumble down the highway to less than 10 in one action scene.Recommendation: I say 6 pack of beer about an hour before Showtime along with a couple of hits off the peace pipe should ease the pain of this film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

From the little bit I would allow people to tell me about it, I assumed it was highly original and sophisticated.  I am also a devotee of Alice in Wonderland.  I could never quite figure out how I missed The Matrix when it was released.  With the imminent release of The Matrix Reloaded, it was time to buy the DVD and watch it.The disappointment was too great.  The premise of the matrix (the controlling device as opposed to the movie) was clever.  The philosophical premise of parallel worlds, alternate realities is shopworn.  However, I could still have bought into the film, as science-fiction, if it stayed firmly in that genre.  Unfortunately, it turned into a standard, ""will they or won't they escape, break through, rescue those in need of rescue, etc."" To make matters worse, it turned out to be another martial arts exercise. The problem is that science-fiction and martial arts films are really two different types.  To the purest, the devotee of one or the other, mixing the two doesn't work.  It is like mixing science-fiction with romance.  You can have one or the other, but not both in the same film, or, at least, not both to the same extent in the same movie.If there were such problems with The Matrix,  The Matrix Reloaded really compounded the problems.  At least thirty minutes of the film were either martial arts sequences or the protracted car-chase.  (This observation ignores the question, made in every professional, negative review of the movie: If Neo could do the Superman thing, why bother to fight at all? The answer, of course, is that's what draws the young, male demographic group into the theatre.)  Then there is the ""redemption through love"" aspect.  That plot device was worn out by Richard Wagner over a hundred years ago.  It was actually handled better by him in Die Gotterdammerung.So where does that leave those who saw the Matrix Reloaded.  Martial arts fans probably groaned through the trite, but arcane sci-fi philosophizing. Science fictions fans were wondering why they were sitting through a kung-fun fest.  Most of the males in the audience where probably bored by the silly romance aspect of the film.Just what are you supposed to be getting for your bucks when you see The Matrix franchise films:  Science fiction, martial arts, or soap opera?  A bit of each does not make for a whole lot more of any of them, nor for a satisfying film for the afficionados of each.","12 out of 25 found this helpful.

Completely out of sync with the action and it really spoiled the rhythm.And those Lawrence Fish-bone speeches.. so dire, so naff. Probably written by some hippy.

While the story doesn't go from Kansas to OZ and back, the developments make sense, but aren't nearly as bold as the original. What totally shines is the over-stylized, absolutely epic action. The fight between Neo and the Smiths is my favorite fight in the whole series. I am a huge fan of massive over-stylized action combat, and RELOADED has it in spades.

I will discuss this the best I can without spoiling anything. Let me start with the basics. I thought the sound, cinematography, and CG effects were outstanding. Note: I hated the visual effects in Spiderman. This was much better. I also found the plot to be very good. I loved the twist realization Neo made at the end of the film. The script I felt was adequate. The scenes were done in traditional fashion  Some action, some romance, etc. I feel that the directors could have gone more out on a limb and made a truly dark twisting introspective film, but they chose to make an action movie. I felt the acting was moderate. You could make an argument that there isn't much to the characters, but I feel that Keanu Reeves could have performed the emotional torment Neo is going through with how many treat him as being the One much better than what he did. He should remember what it felt like to have his puppy dog run over by a car when he was a kid and shed some real tears on screen. I felt that Carrie-Anne Moss brought some real emotional content to Trinity. Again, I am impressed with her a second time. Morpheus' speech at the temple was done really well. Good job Laurence Fishburne. Its the only ACTING they let you actually do in these films, and it was awesome. I think by far though, the best performance in the film was Lambert Wilson as the Merovingian. Just outstanding. I have two things to say about the script that might contradict each other. First I would like to say that I liked how the movie didn't hold your hand from scene to scene trying to explain everything. You had to really pay attention to understand who was who and what was going on, and yes, it all did make scene. I do dislike though that they put so much emphasis on their mumbo-jumbo philosophy. This movie should not, in any way, be looked at as a great work of philosophy. Most everything was cut and pasted from real intellectually accepted philosophers. I feel that anyone who walks around and says, `Oh yeah man, Matrix Reloaded is so awesome. Its such a philosophical movie,' is just really impressed with big confusing words. Overall, I was thoroughly entertained by the film, loved the ending, really want to see the next one, and would some day own a box set of the three films. What more can I say about it.Patrick","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With that said, if you do not like brain cavities, I suggest not seeing THE MATRIX RELOADED.  In fact, you should protest against it.

The director imagined a world with artificial intelligence. The machine world is not dated, so we have no idea if this is likely to be in the 21st century or 25th century. No one knows. They then wanted to create a movie based on their knowledge of the Vedas and created a set of characters based on Greek mythology and Hindu philosophy. The main theme of this movie is Humans Vs. Machines. They imagined that one day machines would be at a distinct advantage and that humans would be struggling to protect their planet. They also included numerous references to religion. Their idea in my opinion came from watching world war movies. They knew that world war 3 would not be nuclear, so in their imagination they created Sentinels. I have absolutely no idea how they thought of a human as a computer program and virtual reality. Ingenious, no doubt. They created the story well from Matrix v1. In v1, it was just about action and dodging bullets – no one would have understood anything but Hollywood fans would have wanted to watch v2. I think the brothers knew V2 and V3 had planned them before V1. Conceptually, the movie is about philosophy and psychology. The main theme is love. But why do they include references to religion (no Hinduism), was it deliberate to get the inquisitive audience. Were they trying to reach an audience who can think at a higher plane or was it just that they wanted to confuse everything and make a movie about love. There are numerous references to Zion, the holy land between Israel and Palestine. Did the brothers forget that the origin of life is from the Ocean. There are also many quotes from the bible, and many references to Buddhism. In my opinion, Buddha was a genius – Buddha re created what was already present in Vedas and started his own religion. The highway chases, martial arts and fighting aside the brothers did not imagine anyone to reverse engineer the script to find out the idea behind the matrix. I don't think the brothers wanted anyone to go read the Ramayana or the Mahabaratha, and in my opinion both these texts are fiction and just like the brothers wrote the matrix story, some other genius wrote the story behind these texts. Yes there is proof of a holy land in Sri Lanka but can you show me proof of flying monkeys or there is proof that a war happened at Kurukshetra but can you show me proof of Krishna and estimate the size of the armies. 5 brothers with a common wife against 100 evil brothers seems like a made up story to me. The director of the matrix movie expected his audience to be enthralled by the machine world vs. Humans war. Not by the infinite references to Greek mythology where the character names are derived or the Hindu philosophy of the one. Also the one has a guru in Hinduism, so this is clearly portrayed in the movie. I do not believe that the director of the matrix has read the Hindu texts fully – they just wanted to create a futuristic movie and mix up various subjects mostly mythology, psychology. They also wanted people to become more philosophical after watching the movie, a noble goal for Hollywood producers.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It has very little visual continuity withthe original, the story is not as tight, many scenes (the lovescenes in particular) areextremely cliche, some dialogue and acting is absolutely terrible,and the producer / studio /directors (?) gaveway to product placement instead of maintainingartistic integrity.Ok, here it goes...The prodcution design and art direction of the original was incredible. There was a contrastbetween retro technologies (rotary phones, classic cadillacs,etc.) and the themes of theMatrix, the lighting and cinematography was breathtaking, and thespecial effects wereappropriate (and mind boggling).Reloaded retains very little of this.  The suicide-doors caddy gave way to Escalades, CTSs,Audis and Ducattis.  Sleek clean cell phones became chuncky crappyones.Electrodes tookplace of accupuncture.  Scenes were brighter, cleaner and didn't retainthe lighting, color ormood of the original.The special effects, in may cases, were terrible.  In the original instead of resorting tocomplete digital scenes they made the effort to use the actors andcompliment the scene withdigital environments and effects (the way they did this wasrevolutionary).  In Reloaded, manyof the fight scenes were totally digital.  Thedigital body doubles were terrible and took awayfrom the mood and focus.The original had a very tight and original story.  Nothing about the original was cliche.Reloaded's script is filled with holes, eye candy and inconsistency. The story built up aroundan oncoming seige of Zion.  At the end, suddenly the seige wasover??? Why did they spendso much time on the gate scene when Morpheus's ship returned todock if this was notforshadowing something.  What was the deal showing all the machinery andprotection of thegates?  If Zion was not a ""character"" in the movie, these scenesshould have been cut.  Lovescenes were too abrupt, too cliched (i.e. the elevator groping,saving Trinity, etc.).  The scriptgave way to Kung Fu instead of character and story development.  And what's the deal withNeo in the end?  Being able to control the Matrix, which is aprogram, is acceptable, butshooting lightening from his finger-tips and stopping squiddiesbreaks any suspension ofdisbelief.Finally, I was sick of seeing logos (mainly of the cars).  Most people had no idea the blacksedan in the original film was a Cadillac.  Nobody got out of Reloadedwith out seeing theCaddie logo a hundred times, or the Audi logo (the emphasis ofthe shot when the Agentsdrive up), or the Ducatti.Anyway, it was ""ok"", a 3 out of 5 stars, but it definitely is not an academy award winning stunner.I don't know, what do you think, honestly?JAB*~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Ok, I saw the film a second time and, although I have more respect for the film, I'm holding to my original posting.  The film either flies through long action scenes or looses itself in philosophy.  There are how many 'deep' philosophical scenes?  Neo and the Counselor, Neo and the Oracle, Neo and Smith, the French program... I'm missing a few here.  This is a film, instead of burying us in its philosophy it should show us.  The philosophy should come out in the story.  It can't happen the other way around.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It feels as if a different director made Reloaded because the meaningful dialogue, strong story, and the unique and likable characters are missing.  Reloaded simply tries to imitate the greatness of the first Matrix, but fails miserably.  It's obvious that Reloaded and Revolutions could have been one movie because while the first Matrix is fast-paced, Reloaded drags on and on.  It moves along more slowly than Gangs of New York which is still a great film.  Every scene, whether it's dialogue or fighting, feels extended and much too long. The first Matrix was deep and meaningful while Reloaded is pseudo-intelligent and pretentious.   Younger fans of movies like The Fast and the Furious may enjoy the action scenes, but people looking for more should look elsewhere. The musical score is also very poor even though Don Davis returned to score it.  The freeway scene is probably the only good scene in the entire film. The rooftop scene with all the Smiths could have been good, but I just don't feel comfortable or impressed watching CG characters fight (the later parts of the scene).  CG characters should not replace human ones - don't the Wachowski brothers follow their own philosophy? X2 is a far better sequel than Matrix Reloaded.  Definitely see that first as it improves on the first X-Men which was a great movie.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Is there anybody who didn't have a suspicion that there might be some cool action in it?I ask these questions but, of course, I already know the answers.My point is, why is there this constant need for studios to give away so much of their films in their media blitzing. With one or two small exceptions, I had seen virtually every action scene in this film weeks before it came out. All I got in the theater was each scene, I'd seen earlier, but longer.If memory serves, the first film was advertised very mysteriously. I recall a woman in tight black latex floating, frozen in space, about to deliver a kick as the camera flew around her. I recall a man moving so quickly he was a blur as another man tried to shoot him. I recall what appeared to be a menacing robotic squid. I recall Laurence Fishburn's  powerful voice over all these strange visuals talking about something called ""The Matrix"". I was hooked. I knew nothing about this film but I had to see it. I was not disappointed. Virtually everything about the film was amazing and fresh.Four years later, the ads start running for the next installment. I see some amazing things in the new ads. I can't wait to go to the theater to see what I haven't been shown. I movie arrives and I rush to see it. Sadly, I was very disappointed. Virtually everything about the film gave me a sense of deja vu with the exception of the last half hour (which, for a while, I was sure I was watching the preview of the third film as the editing seemed extremely disjointed and haphazard). Don't get me wrong, what's on the screen is ultra-cool for the most part; but believe me, you've already seen most of the action in the commercials before you even step into the theater. (I fear the ads for the film ""Hulk"" are doing the same thing.)I've no comments about the plot at this point as I've basically only seen half of the story. However, before I end, I'll add one last comment; just as I feel shanked when I see a singer lip-syncing during a otherwise live performance, I feel equally reamed when, during an otherwise amazing fight scene, actors are suddenly and obviously replaced by fully computer generated animated characters. It's disappointing when it happens other films of the genre, and it was even more disappointing when it happened in this movie since I assumed, wrongly, that all the wire-work that is really martial-art ballet in the Matrix films would be ""live"". I'm not talking about the multiple Agent Smith's here, either. If I want to see CG cartoons fighting I'll rent Blade 2.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Recalling my experience with 'The Matrix' (I had to watch it twice to understand what was happening), I would say it might be just me...Anyway this film has some more ground breaking effects and death defying stunts, which is perhaps the reason for some of my confusion. Not only does Neo defy death himself several times (fighting over 40 people, dodging bullets etc. etc.) but now he seems to be defying death in others. With the dramatic saviour of Trinity does it not seem like 'The One' has become a God like figure? I appreciate that this may have been the aim but I have no idea where his skills in bringing people back to life (by performing closed-chest heart massage) have come from.Zion had an air of Star Wars about it, I half expected to see Jar Jar Binks at the Council table and indeed this would not have surprised me purely because I hadn't grasped the plot.To be honest this was a slight disappointment given the creativity and originality of 'The Matrix' and I'm left in two minds about whether or not I intend to re-watch it and bother with the sequel later this year.
If you're wide awake and have a good attention span then prepare to be amazed by a loaded action thriller. If not then prepare for lots of big fights and fires and car chases. Ooo car chases.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But let's get a few things straight. They didn't invent bullet time, trenchcoats, sunglasses or black shiny outfits. Nor is the concept of Robots rebelling against mankind after being mistreated a new one. Infact it's got to be one of the oldest in sci-fi history.Okay, as I said I liked the films and when you look at what they achieved with what is basically a sack full of action/sci-fi cliques it's pretty damn impressive. This is largely down to the directors vision in putting this together. It's the glue that is important not the individual parts. None of this is really new, but it's what is being done with it that is impressive.The problem I have is people seem to be forgetting this already. Not least of which being hollywood that seems determined to put these elements into every action film they make without regard to wether they work or not. The excessive bullet time works in the matrix where as it definetly doesn't in films set outside of a manipulated reality (like when they used it in a certain bond film). While the Matrix made good on old cliques it's created a whole load of new ones that seem set to be even more overused then the old ones ever were. This is something many people seem to celebrate about the Matrix series but I think people that do that have missed the point.All this stuff with the game and the animatrix is just cross marketing. Nothing more, nothing less and damn it I'm fed up with seeing everyone wearing trenchcoats. I've been wearing them for as long as I can remember and they've come in and out of fashion but since these films there are more people then ever wearing them. Apparently you have to christen a new DVD player with a matrix film, it's ""traditional"" apparently. This seems a bit of a joke to me. Don't forget even good things can be over-rated (I've said for years that as good as the Beatles were they are still one of the most over-rated bands of all time). It's all getting a bit too prententious for my liking and I think people are letting it cloud their judgement.
This film wasn't as good as the first film. It was somewhat predictable both in style and plot. But as I said it wasn't the most origional of ideas ever stated. The whole plot could have been something off the twilight zone or the outer limits. The imagery is standard cool-gothic and again nothing overly origional. However it is put together tremendously well and there are a few scenes that really impress.It's not the best series of films of all time, and as individual films I doubt this particular one would likely make it into the top 50 (at least not my top 50). Definetly impressive for the special effects, stunts and the way it is all put together. They really do know how to use CGI, many otherwise excellent directors are clueless when it comes to computer animation so they have shown what can be done. I also don't think it's really that ground breaking either when you think about it. Most of the effects used have been around for years, but it shows what can be done with it all. But it's mostly down to focused minds and a lot of hard work rather then doing anything really new. The scripts not the best ever written, the actors are pretty average (especially Keanu Reaves) and the basic plot elements really are not at all origional.But it's all about vision and this film (and the others in the series) have an abundance of it. It is one of the most visually pleasing films to watch and it's important to remember that while the visual elements such as the long coats aren't origional they weren't in high fashion before the first matrix came out and so were picked because they would work in the film and not because they were trendy.It's just sad it has led to hollywood being overun by the idea that having cliques in the films are more important then the suitibility of them being used. Two of the worst films to be victims of that phenomenom I've seen so far have been that last bond film (with the poor madonna soundtrack) and the film of ""House of the Dead"". Do give those a miss.Don't give this film a miss though. It's worth watching the whole trillogy if you can. Although I suspect there aren't many people that haven't.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That being said, I'm going to write this review on the assumption that you've all seen the first one, you know that Neo is the one, blabada blee, bleebadee bloo.The movie opens with an interesting sequence where Trinity (Moss) rides a motorcycle off a building and jumps off before it crashes into a security building. Next part of the sequence, she jumps out the window of a skyscraper with an agent right behind her, the cool matrix bullet time effects kick in, and eventually Trinity gets shot and crashes into a car on the ground. Then Neo (Reeves) wakes up.He's been having this dream before, or at least dreams like it, and oddly enough, it's starting to get him a little bit jumpy. Morheus (Fishburne) believes the end of the war with the machines is coming, and of course that Neo will bring about this end. He takes his ship home but orders one other ship to remain outside of Zion and stay in the matrix so that the Oracle can contact them.Zion is an interesting looking city, and despite its rough unfurnished exterior, it still appears to have a homie feel about it. Everybody gets a little R and R, Neo and Trinity get their freak on, and then it's back out into the real world.When Neo goes to see the Oracle, something interesting happens when he's done talking to her. Agent Smith (Weaving) comes to see him. But how? Wasn't he killed in the first movie? Apparently Smith refused to die, and now he has the ability to copy himself on anybody in the matrix, so there are hundreds of thousands of Smith clones running about, looking for Neo.Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity all pay the Merovingian a visit to try to get the keymaker from him. They need the keymaker so they can get inside the source, which is where they believe Neo can do his thing and turn the tables on the war with the machines.I predicted before I ever watched this movie that it would be like the original Star Wars movies. First one is a stand alone that could have sequels, and at the end of the second, there are tons of loose threads that need to be tied up, meaning there has to be a third movie. I won't say what all the loose threads are. You'll just have to see it yourself. Overall, this movie is a solid action movie with some great martial arts sequences, not to mention the infamous highway chase scene.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth watching)","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Let me explain.  When we all first saw the Matrix most of us were BLOWN AWAY.  It was awesome!  The special effects and action scenes were something that just wasn't seen in movies.  This raised the bar and subsequently was copied by other movies and even music videos to follow.Now in 2003 we have the Matrix Reloaded, one of the most anticipated sequels in movie history.  We all have such high expectations that we ourselves have made it hard for the sequel to live up to the first.  We were expecting something new, but we got the same thing as the first, we were expecting a lot of action, but Reloaded was more story based.Ultimately the Matrix Reloaded serves but one purpose to further the story started by the first one that will lead up to the conclusion in Revolutions. Thats it.  And because of that it was a let down.  It was too long, too over-hyped, too much video-game like special effects and too much of an attempt to make every scene super cool.Hopefully Revolutions will save the series.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I never really thought of the matrix as a movie with a good story, but just nice action. In Reloaded this feeling just got stronger. This movie has truly unbelievable fight scenes and other action scenes, but the thin story around it isn't worth it at all. And the bit of story you get is also not so easy to understand.Don't get me wrong, I loved this movie and as soon it is in the stores I will have my copy, but don't see this movie for the story, for you will be dissapointed.Reloaded also had some funny moments in it, in witch actually the entire audience laughed, but also some fight scenes wich made people laugh. I don't really think the fight scened were supposed to make people laugh, but hey! Who can help it if multiple agents are flying trough the sky because of Neo beating the away.
The action in this movie is incredible, but that's not everything a good movie need... A good story is just as important... I give this movie a 7/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Just go see it.Between the money scenes, we get characters standing at attention and burping prophecies and deep thoughts at each other. A solid followup to a truly genre-transcending film. As sequels go, The Matrix Reloaded is every bit a dynamite film. The dazzling 14-minute chase includes cars, motorcycles, a couple of 18-wheelers - and nonstop martial-arts battles and leaps inside and on top of the vehicles. That scene alone will justify the price of admission for many. High budget, high concept, high drama and high level action are the highlights, but Reloaded has loads of love, too, and much more: it's sci-fi with ranch, for one thing. Death defying stunts, by the dozen. Multiplying Agent Smiths who can morph you into another Smith at the poke of a hand into your ribcage. Fight sequences that draw no blood but demolish buildings. Highway mayhem shot with speeding motorbike-cam. And if you want to get Reloaded with the mystical/spiritual side of The Matrix, this one's for you, too, peppered with profundities and set in an apocalyptic tomorrow where machines threaten to annihilate humans. This is not a totally original concept, I grant you, but the brothers Wachowski have made something new out of the idea, layering Reloaded with philosophical and mystical references. You don't have to dig deep to find any number of references drawn from Christian mythology, like Neo's long black robe, seemingly pilfered from a priest's locker, his disturbing visions, his appellation as The One, his moment of doubt, his healing powers, names of other characters like Trinity and Morpheus.I can't wait to see what the Wachowski's have in store.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

We'd get to see more of Morpheus and the gang. Some of the sets were really cool, like the human city, but the fights were a little overdone in the CGI department. I did like some of them though. Overall, the movie was decent and I don't know if I'll watch it again but the ending led into the third (and supposedly final) chapter of the saga. And now that we're getting another Matrix film, I figured now would be a good time to go back and see what I had missed.Even if this and the third one weren't that great, I'm hoping that the Matrix saga will get its own expanded universe. If Star Wars, Star Trek, Doctor Who and all of those other sci-fi movie sagas can get their very own expanded universes, then why not this one?Bottom line: if you liked the first one, stick with it. Otherwise, the series goes a little downhill after that one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But the Wash-out-ski's managed to pull it off...and guess what? They did it on purpose.Yes, Andy and Lynda made this movie suck on purpose. The original Matrix (which isn't very original) was written well and several years were spent working on the script, and it shows. That's why so many people love it. So when making a sequel, the Wash-out-ski's realized that people will see it anyway, whether it's good or not. People going into this movie had nothing to judge it by except for the first film.The Wash-out-ski's may be thieves, liars, nerds, and homosexuals...but they aren't dumb. Why spend so much time and effort to make it good when people will go and see it anyway? That's exactly what they were thinking. It's why this film broke box office records and the second didn't come close. Because when going into the third and hopefully final Matrix film, the audience had more to judge it by. They saw how awful this piece of crap was, and decided not to see revolutions.So what's so bad about this movie? First, there's the dialogue. One chunk of exposition after another. Sitting there and watching a bunch of idiots explain everything is boring. There's also a big scene that explains why Tank is not in the movie. The problem is: we now know all of this stuff about Link...and we never knew that much stuff about Tank. He's an important crew member, but they never spent any time giving us details beyond that he was freeborn. We get this history of Link, his problems with his wife, whether he should be reassigned to another ship, etc. I know they were trying to make Link into the non-believer who comes to believe...but we didn't need boring scenes to do that.Then there's all the political crap with Morpheus and the commander. It's a boring subplot that we keep going back to but never goes anywhere. It kills the momentum of the story. There's also all the crap with the French guy and his (extremely hot) wife, where we learn about their marriage problems and all that. What the hell as the point of that? How is that any of our business? How does it advance the story? And the pointless fight scene with the Chineese guy...and then there's all the scenes where people are sitting around instead of DOING things.Then the protagonist...Neo. He starts the movie the same way as he ends it. No character arc at all. He's just a God-like being that can beat anybody. A recipe for great fight scenes? No. The exact antithesis.And speaking of the fight scenes...all I can say is WOW...and not in a good way.Agent Smith is back just for the sake of being there. Not just Agent Smith, but countless duplications of himself. This scene had the potential to be really cool, but literally everything about it was just wrong. First, they give away Smith's duplicating ability before the fight. So instead of a shock moment where he duplicates while fighting Neo, we go into the fight knowing this already. The use of CGI would not be so bad if it wasn't so blatantly obvious and poorly executed. The scene also went on for 3 times longer than it had to. Neo vs. Smith, a bunch of Smiths, and EVEN MORE Smiths. OK, we get the point! And we all know that Neo will defeat Smith(s). But no...THE HERO RUNS AWAY! How are we supposed to connect with this character and be on his side when he's running away from a fight? Then on to the big freeway chase. No suspense, no drama, no excitement at all. How can this be? Simple: CGI. It doesn't look like the characters are actually in any kind of danger. It looks like a video game. You know, a racing game where you just put the pedal to the metal and speed the whole way through it without a care in the world. Crashing into the walls? No sweat. We'll be fine. That's exactly what I was thinking while watching this scene. Oh no, I hope Trinity's stunt double doesn't crash head-on into a computer generated car! Give me a break. And let's not forget about the CGI ghost twins that look out-dated by more than a decade. Very scary indeed.I must ask this question: What is the plot of this movie? By the looks of it, there is none. Just seemingly random events happening to people we don't have any reason to care about. The first Matrix film was about Neo being the chosen one and all that, but what the hell is going on here? There's a big section devoted to this Keymaker character who is supposed to be extremely important and legendary...but that didn't work at all. Remember in the first film how legendary Trinity and Morpheus were, even before Neo met them? Here, the Keymaker is just some dude we never heard of before and doesn't seem all that important. He's no legend.And what happened to the mind-bending aspect of the original? Why don't we go down the rabbit hole in reloaded? Instead, it's all matter-of-fact, changing sci-fi to fantasy. Remember how cool it was that the mechanical devices like the bug they plant in Neo seem to be living organisms in the first film? Where's that kind of thing in this film? We're treated to boring politics, needless exposition and back stories of characters that don't really do anything that warrants the need to know all this personal information about them.I won't even comment on the horrible acting, bad directing, and the Neo-Trinity sex scene. That speaks for itself, as does the bile you will puke up after seeing it.","9 out of 18 found this helpful.

It turns out there are several ships that cruise around ""freeing"" people. But now Zion is being threatened with destruction by the machines and there are two approaches being considered for repelling their attack: 1) fight them face-to-face and defend Zion in the real world or 2) send in ""the One"" to destroy the Matrix from the inside.That's it, that is all there is to the plot. The bottom line is that the story has been sold out to the special effects, and those weren't even as good as the first movie. There are several times when the special effects are completely computerized and in fact look like a computer video game. For comparisons sake the Star Wars prequel graphics are far superior. There is no substitute for actors (LOTR being the only possible exception).The script was apparently so focused on the fight scenes and special effects that it basically forgets it's self. There are several sub stories that arise but are never developed, explained or addressed with any satisfaction. Link's wife is mad at him for working on the Nebekenezer (but it is hard to tell), Neo and Trinity are in love (but didn't we all know that already? was a 5 minute ""love"" scene really necessary?), some kid who Neo apparently saved is following him around (why should we care at all about this kid, Neo doesn't? and who the HELL is he?), Morpheus and Niobe used to have a thing I guess (but again it is hard to tell), There are a couple of ""ghost twins"" that are quite powerful (but who are they, where did they come from, and how come there is not more concern for the damage they can do?) and so on and so forth. By developing just a couple of these lines (or limiting the love angle) there could have been much more support for the main story. Instead they end up just being the frayed edges of an unraveling rope.Keanu's style of acting (if you can call it that) no longer fits here. It was perfect in the first movie, but it fails here, Neo almost appears to be board with being ""The One"".I guess I have to go see Revolutions in the fall, just to see what happens. But unless Revolutions somehow salvages the end of the story, I will consider the story to have ended with the first one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

First of all the storyline is thin and secondly action is the bulk. I did not enjoy it as much as the first. Let me compare it with the first and rate it.1) The very concept of Matrix captured the storyline and Neo was the essence of Matrix, that gave a solid foundation for the story, it really did a great job. But I feel it had more to tell. They could have done a better job when focussing on Zion, somehow it did not seem the most important aspect of the film. Also Neo should have been put in the apprenticeship, it would have been amazing to seem him become the master a bit later or even the end of the movie, it would have given a sense of vulnerability and made it more exciting.
2) Action seemed to fill in places most of the time.It was fantastic seeing the explosions, but we did experience most of it in the first part, nothing new out here.3) Hats off for the special effects, i did enjoy the agent smith versus Neo fight a lot.

The stop-action action scenes were cool, so Reloaded features two interminably long action scenes that got rather tiresome.  The hacker stuff was cool, so how about a Freudian monologue about Neo's true purpose from the matrix's architect?  Add to that an out of place sex scene and Neo's unexplained power in the real world, and you've got a mess.  A very long mess.If they shortened the action scenes, moved the architect's monologue up in the film, and then had Neo struggle with the concept of free will, Reloaded could have been much better.  As is, I can only recommend it if you intend to see Revolutions.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

First the good bits. This movie contains some of the most jaw-droppingly amazing action sequences I have ever seen. Gladiator showed what live action and computer generation could do if you respect the laws of physics. The Matrix Reloaded shows what you can do if you don't - and in the process it takes George Lucas' Star Wars' prequels outside and gives them a good kicking. My two favourites are the scene when Neo fights a hundred clones of Smith (formerly Agent Smith), and the scene when Neo flies into rescue his friends following a spectacular head-on collision between two trucks.So what's wrong with it? First, the superficial stuff. The Matrix was cool. The blue hue, the soundtrack, the cellphones, the outfits - all just screamed coolness. Reloaded does not live up to that.Second, the characters. In the first film, we barely get to know our characters and we don't care - their superficial but they kick ass. By the end of the second film, we're sorry we have got to know them better, because there ain't much to know. Trinity's only redeeming feature seems to be looking good in pvc; if Neo is the One then he does a damn good job of permanently looking lost and/or dumb; and Morpheus, so promising in the first film, seems just increasingly pompous.Third, the beauty of the first film was the elegant simplicity of its plot. Reloaded has none of that. It is confused and rather pedestrian, brought together partially at the very end but too late to save it. And the final cliffhanger looks like a cop-out for failing to come up with something more dramatic.Finally, Reloaded illustrates the classic film-makers dilemma that necessity is the mother of invention. There was no limit to what the directors could do with this film, and that feels like part of the problem. Zion, for example, such a powerful idea when it is left to the viewers' imagination, is horribly disappointing when depicted in such a cliched fashion (candles and dancing to house music in caves - give me a break).
So viewers have a dilemma. You've gotta watch it, for the action sequences alone. But overall, you'll be disappointed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Obviously after the success of the original Matrix, the head honchos of Warners gave a large amount of cash to the Wachowski's and asked for more and guess what? That's exactly what they did, with this new entry in the world of Matrix, the mainstream film goers finally got what they just wanted to see - Neo, Trinity and Morpheus back in action and for that, boy did the film deliver.The Matrix Reloaded starts with Trinity riding a motorcycle into a building guard shack, then being chased by an agent around inside the building before jumping out of a skyscraper window where we get to see bullet-time aka slow-mo treatment of Trinity firing her pistols as she falls. In the middle of the flick, we get to see Neo take on a vast array of replicated Smiths where we get to see non stop martial arts action which is heavily influenced by Japanese Anime and old school Hong Kong action flicks. We also get to see an underground cave city of Zion and the wild rave parties that take place there, which begins to turn into a pulsating orgy. We see Neo and Trinity escape to a bedroom where they have sex to the tempo of the wildly beating drums. Glimpses of rear and side nudity accompany their movements where barely-clothed bodies sway and leap, rub and thrust as the torch-lit mob gives themselves to the tribal stomp- style rhythms.The movie has a number of complicated dialogue and monologues from new and current characters that end up making you feel confused of what they have said and trying to keep up with the rules of this wonderful universe. The film does allow viewers to go deeper into the rabbit hole, but this is the first time as a movie enthusiast that I felt uncertain about where this hole was heading. The explanation of the universe is over complicated such as rogue programmers, yet the story overall is simple, an army of sentinels is set to invade Zion and kill the remaining rebel humans.The story however isn't as appealing to the original. To be honest this story feels like you are playing a video game, which isn't bad. At each stage, heroes fight off attackers in order to finish that level and proceed to the next one. First, Neo must reach the Oracle. She tells him to find the Key Maker and get the key that opens a secret door. To secure the Key Maker, Neo must get through the Merovingian and his henchmen. To reach the secret door, the rebel Zion crew must disable the security alarms...or it's game over.The acting suffers from the same problems as the plot - it is all too heavy and this can be demonstrated with a key character Morpheus (played by the great Laurence Fishburne) who in the original played a very dynamic character - from waking Neo up to The Matrix, talking like a prophet and having a mix of playful wit and serious touches when they were needed. In this sequel, his character seems to be mistaken that he is playing a political leader for example him speaking to the crowds at Zion before the rave party. Even his fight scenes, in the first film his face-off with Smith you could see the vulnerability however in this film he is more like a rock and less fun and mentoring.New characters such as Persephone who bares quite a bit of cleavage and her partner the programmer Merovingian both feel unimportant in this film. Why bring in a character who can manipulate the Matrix code in a way that compels a woman to give him oral pleasures and provide them satisfaction when eating a desert? The transparent twins also were wasted in this film.Overall, it was always going to be hard to follow up the first film. There are reversal call backs to the original where you saw Trinity bringing Neo back to life with a kiss in the first film. In this sequel it is Neo who returns the favour by resuscitating Trinity by reaching inside her digitized body and ""healing"" the computer code that's been disrupted by a bullet. Did you get that? Yeh complicated right? The epic car chase is awesome where we see fight scenes that do not involve Neo, we see Morpheus kicking butt and Trinity driving through a highway where we see enough vehicles crashing and burning to make the creators of The Fast and the Furious drool with envy. However the overall plot loses its simple touch by diving too deep into the computer language world. One thing that the movie didn't squander was upping the ante with fetish style leather costumes. 7/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Do I think it is equal to the first? no.The special effects in the first one helped explain the Matrix, drive the story and the character development, they also were seamless. at no point in the first film did I look at Keanu and think I wasn't seeing him, because the wire work and the compositing was second to none. In Reloaded, while I enjoyed the ride, there were plenty of times during the fights that it was obvious that I was looking at a 3D model of Keanu and not the actor. and while they were excellent models....they were models none the less.Suddenly instead of buying the reality of the Matrix I was standing outside of it. If you are watching a movie about a false reality that is too perfect to distinguish from reality, then the effects should be indistinguishable from reality as well, and sometimes they were not. In the Matrix they were, in Reloaded the scene of Keanu flying in the clouds was obviously 3D...some wire work by The actor and a cheaper compositing process would have kept me in the reality of that shot better. (the original super man did that in the seventies) my long winded point is this. no one special effect type is the best for every situation and it never will be. 3D is a tool just like wire work and compositing are. judicious use of each yields the best results and in the original film, that is what was done, though most likely because of money constraints. Simplicity of effects is what made those scenes in the first so ground breaking and rock solidly mind blowing. not simplicity in choreography mind you.The best parts of the fight between Neo and the Smiths in Reloaded were the ones where they used live actors for the fights and judiciously used 3D compositing to put Agent Smiths face on all of the players. Believe me, I want to watch the ""One"" battle the smiths again and again and when I buy the dvd when it comes out on the first day of it's release I will, but that doesn't change the fact that the fight in the train station in the first film never made me think for a second that I wasn't actually watching them fight. it was hyper reality, not animated fantasy. ...and Hyper-reality confounds the noodle more than fantasy ever will, so in short, I loved it and hated it all at the same time, I paid for the ticket I'm allowed.Will I see Revolutions on the first day it opens in November....you bet I will.Sam Scum","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Keanu dodged bullets famously, and redefined cool, and all that, but the very concept of The Matrix/The Real World was truly overwhelming. It blew everyone away by forcing them to think.Reloaded, while taking special effects to a whole new extreme, lacks the force of concept. Rather, it's non-cept. The entire premise is rather reminiscent of the plot-lacking Mission:Impossible, all very well for drops of sweat crucially dropping onto gloves, but that's about it. With an unfortunate non plot ridden full of far more holes than Trinity's body, Reloaded disappoints sorely. As for the effects. Trinity, on the Ducati. Wow. This is worth ticket price alone. As with the original, Reloaded changes your views on just what technology can be done, used brilliantly. But it's a wee bit tired. So there are a hundred clones of Agent Smith - fantastic. So Keanu can fly. So everyone leaps through enormous distances and slows in mid air, turns, and kicks, before flying through solid walls. Yawn. We've seen it before. Done far better this time, but, really, what's new? The characters, too, are upsetting. The epitome of cool, Morpheus, is now a droning, evangelising Bible salesman. Trinity, well, rocks. So do the bad guys, who have fabulous lines. Persephone, we see too little off to even drool over. But Keanu - tsk, tsk.

The first of its two sequels, The Matrix Reloaded, had huge expectations to live up to, but is everything its predecessor was and more: more visually stunning, more intense, more confusing. After learning that Zion, the last human city on Earth, is on the brink of destruction, Neo (Keanu Reeves) and his cohorts, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), dive back into the Matrix searching for a way to save humanity. The story is initially very confusing (and may take multiple viewings to fully comprehend), but is ultimately very deep and satisfying, despite its cliffhanger ending. Reloaded's biggest asset, however, is the special effects that highlight its action sequences, which are absolutely sensational. While sometimes longwinded, The Matrix Reloaded is a spectacular ride that no fan of the original should miss. There's a reason why the Matrix universe has become so popular: it's just plain awesome.9 out of 10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I thoroughly enjoyed it and although it only 'built' on ideas introduced in the Matrix it had a fair share of innovation as well. Whoever thinks that the 'superman' thing is tacky is taking the whole thing way too seriously - do you honestly think superman was the first guy to fly in cinema!?If you're one of those miserable people that enjoys complaining about how ""the sequel never lived up to the first"", ""there's nothing on tv nowadays"" and ""why can't I get decent cup of coffee"" then enjoy the rest of your time complaining your way through your next few decades. However, if you're prepared to get the most out of cinematic experiences then there's plenty in Matrix Reloaded to keep you going for a while.RobI give it 10/10 'cos I enjoyed the best parts of the film and ignored the slightly plasticky CG Agent Smiths and Neos.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

He began saying stuff like. ""What the Brothers have done, nobody will be able to duplicate for years to come..."". Then the lame ads came, the less than amazing previews, and the bad pre-buzz of the movie. By the time I actually saw the movie, my push to see it, had gone down to basically zero.I went into the the movie with 3 friends of mine, all of whom enjoyed the first movie. Most of them wanted to see the film more than I did. We ALL came out with the same views...the movie is not that great. It is a HUGE dissapointment. There is nothing really spectacular at all in the movie. Most of the time, it drags, and lags, spitting out corny as hell dialogue, that comes to the point of laughable. Morpheus's speech at Zion, is one of the funiest moments in the whole film. Everyone in the theater was laughing at this scene. The acting is a major low point in the movie. In the original Matrix, we had all of that shady metaphorical dialogue, but for some reason, we bought it in that one. In Reloaded, something has gone horribly wrong with the actors. They lost the touch from the first movie. It just doesn't work here. The plot of the movie, is easier to follow than the first, until a certain point. I actually got the first half. This did not happen in the first. I had to watch the original a couple of times before I fully understood what was going on. The whole Agent Smith plot, the Keyaster or whatever, and the whole Creator of the Matrix thing is just too complicated. I had a huge problem with the Creator scene. You know the actor is telling us something major. But he talks ridiculously fast, and uses massive words, it gets hard to follow. And the ""shock"" ending I heard about, isn't really a shock.The movie isn't a total loss though, the effects are pretty cool, and the action is enough to keep you into the movie. The Hyped 14 minute car chase scene is good, but it's not nearly as revolutionary or massive as people are saying it is. And I have one question: where is the Bullet Time? It's not here that much. They opted to use more slow motion shots. The Bullet Time shot at the end of the car chase scene is incredible. It's my favorite moment in the movie. But why take out something that basically defined the original movie? Why use the slow motion instead? They claim that the effects cost 100 million alone. I;m sure they had plenty of money to do it. Seeing Neo fly in the movie is awsome. Warner Bros. is going to put out the next Superman movie soon. This just makes me want that movie more. And they really abuse the use of CG people. Bottom line, I'm not quite sure they have made a film, that's going to make people want to see the next installment as much as this one. There were BOOS all over the theater when the movie ended. People were calling the film retarded. I think it left a sour taste in the majority of the audiences that saw it. The only thing they have going for it, is the ending is a cliffhanger. People are probably going to want to see how it ends, but Reloaded is nothing spectacular. X2, is still the movie to beat this summer.6.5 OUT OF 10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The action sequences were technically spectacular but had absolutely no intensity or any sense of drama at all.  They were almost meaningless.

After 4 years of falling in love with The Matrix, I found myself trying to like Matrix Reloaded as I was watching it, convincing myself that Matrix Reloaded did not suck, and I was not bored by the special effects, or the one-liners, or the story line.  But who am I kidding, if it was really such a great flick, I would be spending 100% of my time enjoying it, loving it.  But I wasn't. The story was the most disappointing part.  After we learned what was the Matrix four years ago, the movie was trying to throw in some extra twists to complicate the plot, and to explain certain concepts that were better left un-explained.  The fight scenes were not any better either, most of them were overly pretentious and LOOOONNNNG.  I was so unimpressed by them that I was constantly asking myself ""Is it gonna end anytime soon?""  The highway car chase scene... yes, a lot of car stunts, a lot of fighting, and tons of bullet-time... but you know what?  I prefer the good old Ronin-style car chase.Ronin = white-knuckle excitement.Matrix Reloaded = Yawn... are we there yet?Forget about the Matrix.  Remove my expectation and anticipation.  Just consider this movie as a separate entity that has no relationship with the Matrix what so every.  I would give the movie 6/10.

""Matrix Reloaded"" has outdone those fine movies in spades.Here's how the movie seemed to me:  action sequence followed by 10-minute diatribe, followed by cooler action sequence, followed by 10-minute diatribe.  Repeat several times.I completely understood the original ""Matrix"" by the time my first viewing of that film was over.  But I think I'll have to see this one another ten times before I have any idea what the Wachowskis were trying to say.All my friends thought this movie was great.  I left the theater with mixed feelings.  While scenes like the freeway chase had my heart pumping, I felt like taking a nap during the ridiculous speeches by Morpheus, the Oracle, the French snob, and The Architect.  While The Architect's high-falooting vocabulary did not contain any words unknown to me, his message was completely incomprehensible to me.  And there is absolutely no way that anyone who does not have a very strong grasp of the English language could have understood anything he said.So call me stupid.*** WARNING: SPOLIERS ***
I really thought the Wachowskis were trying to stuff too much story and philosophy into one film.  I mean, I felt like I would have had to have read a 500-page tome beforehand to have understood the film.Let's look at all of the concurrent storylines -- the issue of rogue programs (like Agent Smith, who appears to have evolved into some sort of computer virus, though, of course, they never explain this in such understandable terms).  The revelation that Morpheus is not the captain of a lone ship, but one of many, some of which do not believe as he believes. The issue of self-programming programs (the French jackass (Agent Smith seems to have no idea how he evolved)).  The matter of secret countermeasures (the Oracle).  The unexplained appearance of twin vampires (though I don't believe the movie actually explained that they were vampires in an explicit manner).  Then there was the marvelously-complex rant by The Architect.  Neo is the sixth Neo, Neo has been designed purposefully as a tool for... well, whatever in the blue hell that dude was raving about.I mean, seriously, anyone who completely understood this movie, my hat is off to you.  I found the dialogue pretentious, overbearing, sanctimonious, and at times frivolous.  And I also thought that the Wachowskis must have purposefully been trying to confuse people, because the script was so damn obtuse.Having said that, the fight scenes were very cool.  But so were the ones in the original ""Matrix.""  And, IMHO, nothing in ""Matrix Reloaded"" was as original or cool as the ""marble hallway"" fight sequence towards the end of the original.May I say that I thought the ending was ridiculous?  I mean, they try to pull of a cliffhanger ending by having Neo in a coma at the end of this flick, then after credits are finally over, you see the teaser for the third installment, which shows Neo just fine.  What is that?Well, I guess most people didn't sit through the ridiculous 10-minute-long credit roll.  I bet 98% of people left right when the credits began.  And I was p***ed to have sit through what had to be over one thousand credits in order to view a crappy 90-second teaser.BTW, if you like the fight scenes in the Matrix series, check out the movie ""Equilibrium"", which exhibits a fighting style much more groundbreaking and exciting than that in Matrix.  In my opinion, the ""gun-kata"" style of ""Equilibrium"" would make for a terrific match against Neo.  Neo has to slow apparent time down to avoid bullets.  The Grammaton Clerics don't need to slow time down to avoid them.  Plus, it is a fantastic film that was made (amazingly, to look at it) for like 1/15th of the budget of Matrix 2.So there is my criticism of ""Matrix Reloaded"" as well my plug for ""Equilibrium"" (no I do not work for any media company).  It's a good movie but don't wait in line for an hour to see it.  I know I kind of wished for my $7 and hour of waiting in line back.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Here's the thing, sure there are a few scenes that seem a bit too computer generated, such as the Agent Smith fight scene, or when Neo is flying around, but you need to realize that the film can't be as ground-breaking as the original in the effects department.  It is stunning, visually, but the original introduced so many new cinematic effects and ideas that there's no way that Reloaded could match that without seeming like an entirely different film, and not the smoothly transitioned sequel that it is.  The massive party scene at Zion could be completely removed from the film, as at four and a half minutes, it seems to drag on forever without being at all necessary to the plot.  The fact that there is a party enhances the feel of the film, but not the closeups and cuts to Neo and Trinity having sex.  Other than that, and let me stress that is a small problem, the movie is amazing.  I would recommend it to anyone that was a fan of the first.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Hollywood has programmed us now to expect our sequels to be bigger, faster, louder but this one starts off slow. There's some interesting stuff involving an assault on a tower block and some upgraded Agents but then we're forced to suffer nearly 45 minutes of new age and pseudo-religious exposition that offers no real expansion of concepts already introduced in the original. This is topped by a badly mis-judged love scene between Neo and Trinity inter-cut with footage from what appears to be a huge underground rave which had the audience I saw the movie with laughing out loud! Not, I think, what most people were expecting.Pulses start to quicken in a scene in which the Oracle reappears and Neo faces an army of Agent Smiths but this sequence, whilst technically ambitious, seems a little mechanical and lifeless (some of the CGI work here is a bit obvious). At this point I was yearning for the movie to start acting and feeling more like the original.Thankfully, help is on hand with the introduction of a character called Merovingian and his duplicitous wife Persephone. An amusing and charmingly played scene in a restaurant could have been lifted straight out of the first movie being at once witty, frustratingly enigmatic and with that distinctive threatening undertone that characterised the early scenes in the original.Things then shift up a gear with a well choreographed fight scene between Neo and Merovingian's henchmen followed by the most impressive thing in the movie: a balls-out freeway chase scene that has to rank amongst the most exciting and stunning action sequences ever put on film. This juggernaut of a sequence takes no prisoners. The Wachowski brothers really strut their stuff combining fantastic stunt-work, special effects and their own distinctive camera-style to devastating effect. It's worth the price of admission on it's own and is the sequence that stays with you when the movie is finished. It's timely arrival makes you realise the first movie was not a flash in the pan and you immediately forgive this sequel for it's ponderous start.The rest of MATRIX RELOADED, whilst not without interest, never really recovers it's stride once the freeway chase is over (it feels like the movie has climaxed) and has the same problem of all middle parts of a trilogy: a sudden and abrupt end.Purists will no doubt agree with me when I say no one does this stuff like the Wachowskis and this has their stunning visual style stamped all over it. Having now seen the film a few times, I can say it does stand up to repeated viewings but, once seen, it's that terrific middle section you wait for during subsequent viewings. MATRIX RELOADED is definitely a much better film than the third part of the trilogy, MATRIX REVOLUTIONS.

Back in those times educational standards were far more polarised between classes who could afford education and those who could not. You would have had a theatre packed with both rowdy fairly unintelligent folk who stood near the stage, those in between, as well as intelligent upper class who sat above them. They all came to see Shakespeare's work. This was unusual for a playwright to have such a wide appeal among the classes. The reason it worked was because there was something for everyone  action, romance, philosophy, wit, intelligence etc.I believe the matrix trilogy to have a similar trait. Why? Well because they truly changed my life. I was not someone who would ever consider going to see a movie about philosophy (much a less read a book on it), or a movie that asks us to question reality, systems of control, choice, love, purpose etc. I would have been ignorant of a work that drew upon such 'nerdy' questions. I was drawn to the Matrix by the action like a moth to light, and once I was there I was zapped by its themes. Soon, I wanted to know more. What did such a scene mean? I wanted to know more about things in my own life  my work, my blind religious faith, my ignorant acceptance of the world around me. I woke up I guess. No other movie trilogy has had such a profound impact on my day to day life than the Matrix saga.I think that's amazing. Such ideas bred by a popular entertainment piece. I was once an action movie sci-fi freak and would have never wanted to read or talk about such notions. I'm changed due to these movies  and for the better. I can only speak for myself but I thank the wachowskis for waking me up and showing me a different view of reality.Neo  I can't go back can I? Morpheus - No. And if you could, would you really want to?","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I don't think I could sit through the Zion dancing scene again, and there are many other scenes I could do without.  It's hard to fast-forward though the bad acting though, since it's spread throughout the film.Anyway, I didn't expect the acting to be good, but I did expect a lot from the special effects department.  Sometimes they delivered, and sometimes they put stuff on the screen that made me cringe.   Let's just say that when people look back at some of the CGI in this movie, they'll say ""this was cutting edge at one point?"" I don't mind the use of CGI as long as it's integrated into the film well.  If you can pinpoint the specific time that CGI cuts into a scene, then the film makers have not done their job.  Like the people in the Lord of The Rings documentary said: ""people shouldn't know that they're looking at an effects shot"".In the Matrix you can tell exactly when Neo is CGI and that takes so much away from the experience.  And one thing is clear...  you should never... ever.... ever do close-up slow motion CGI shots of a human... at least not for another 10 years or so. The main redeeming part of the action in this movie is the freeway chase. That was quality, and you couldn't tell when CGI was used, since it was used for vehicles and far away shots of the agent jumping on the car. Anyway, it wasn't a bad movie... but it just wasn't polished work.  I expected a bit more.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If you liked the first one, you cannot possibly dislike this one.Make no mistake about it, while this movie has its flaws-much like any movie does-The Matrix Reloaded is 2x better than the first installment.  They have improved each technique and every facet of the first movie. It is a slam dunk.  The Matrix has definitely solidified itself as being one of the most successful movie franchises in history.  Already, it belongs with such other notable trilogies as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Back to the Future, Lord of the Rings.  This is before the 3rd installment has even been released. Again, this movie is spectacular in every way and certainly worth the price of admission.  See it or it's your loss!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The actors are all good, especially Carrie Anne Moss, but Fishburne is just doing a one-note performance and Jada Pinckett Smith is underused.

Exactly what were people expecting? Let's get something straight here and now: the original was incredibly entertaining and incredibly stupid as well, and don't deny that. It managed to be appealing on two very contrasting levels. It was cerebral and heady but also had enough fighting and shooting to appeal on a basic primal level. For every plot twist you were trying to decipher you were equally interested in seeing some major butt kicking. It was a heady, confusing and intricate plot blended with big, dumb fun. The acting was incredibly (deliberately?) bland and wooden with zero humor. Q: Who were the most enigmatic and entertaining personalities in the first film? A: Joey Pants and Agent Smith - the ""bad"" guys. Ironic that the agent (the least human character) turns out to be the funniest and most entertaining character in the series. So please, don't go on lamenting the salad days of the original, because that film was far from perfect and the sequel manages to give the people what they want and bring the storyline and effects up to date.Yes, Matrix Reloaded further utilizes the now over-used and over-exposed special effects techniques that, unfortunately, have been embraced by everyone from Saturday Night Live to car commercials. That's the trademark style of these films, and you can't blame the filmmakers for being ripped off in the interim. Like it's predecessor, Matrix Reloaded offers it's share of dumb scenes as well, such as the incongruous erotic dance scene. And some action scenes actually go on a bit long. But the film still manages to stimulate and lure you in with bigger, better action and effects, a continuing intricate (and still confusing) plot line, and fresh, amazing visuals that may seem familiar (if only in style) but are still unlike anything you've seen before.Go see it and enjoy it, and be prepared to be equally blown away and annoyed as only the Matrix can deliver.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It had a good, fresh concept with interesting characters, unexpected twists and turns in the plot, downright excellent action scenes, and of course, state-of-the art special effects. It's not something that'll get on my best movies list, but it's pretty good.""The Matrix Reloaded"" is merely a little above average. It's got significantly better action and effects, but the plot just isn't as good as the original's.""Reloaded"" starts at what seems to be a few years after the original. We find that all this time, the cast has been fighting a war against the machines that operate the Matrix. It's actually been going on for over a hundred years. However, some events have been forming that lead Morpheus, the leader of the group, to believe that the events of some prophecy that foretells that the war will soon end are unfolding. Meanwhile, Agent Smith, who Neo destroyed in ""the Matrix,"" has returned. Seems his death resulted in his removal from the Matrix, but because he didn't want that, he's been reinstated as an ex-Agent without a purpose. He now has the ability to turn normal people into clones of himself through touch. To give himself purpose again, he must satisfy the machines by getting rid of Neo. And Neo is now having terrible visions of the future in his dreams that the Oracle confirms to be true.The special effects and downright astounding. Armed with a far larger budget than the original had, ""Reloaded"" truly goes for broke. The hyper-fast and slow-motion action scenes, production designs, and CGI are some of the best ever.The acting is pretty good. But no one really stands out. That you can definitely believe that they're all the characters they're playing is all you need to say.Come to think of it, the only real problem lies in the plot. First and foremost, the return of Agent Smith. I had bad feelings about the movie the moment I saw this in the trailer. But what I'd pictured was nowhere near as bad as what I saw. The excuse the bring him is pretty weak. Because he didn't want to no longer exist? How is that relevent? How does he get this new ability to turn people into copies of himself? Fortunately, Smith doesn't get too much screen time and therefore doesn't hurt the movie as much as he should.The rest of the plot ain't bad at all. But what makes the film mediocre to me is that there's just too much. There's at least three things going on that could be movies on their own. As a result, the movie is hurt badly; you can only do so much with so many subplots in two hours. So while all of them are good concepts except the return of Smith fiasco, they by necessity are not furthered enough.Which is too bad. In my book, ""Reloaded"" would probably be great with less subplots (and making sure the Smith ""resurrection"" was eliminated from the final script). Of course, it also ties directly into ""Revolutions."" I myself have never seen it and won't until it's released on DVD, but since none of ""Reloaded's"" plot points were ever resolved, I doubt if it rose above being ""Matrix Reloaded Part Two"" in quality as well as story.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Matrix - Reloaded is definitely as good as the first and technically superior. The amount of care given to the story and not just relying on the FX will make Reloaded a huge success. The chemistry between the characters is much better now that the introductions are over and the actors are allowed to have had fun here, as evidenced by more interjections of humor than in The Matrix. I have mixed feelings about the new characters that are introduced, and unfortunately the new male characters, outshine the female ones hands down. Harold Perinneau Jr. is a great addition as Link, the new pilot of the Nebachanezzar, and the real life twins Adrian and Neal Rayment as ""The Twins"" are cool, eerie, and funny. But Jada Pinkett Smith's Niobe and the very beautiful Monica Bellucci as Persephone are distractions and seem to have little to do with the story-line. More sexual tension between Niobe and Morpheus, (they are ex-lovers) should have existed in my opinion. Regardless of the storyline, characters, and acting, however, the special effects, fight scenes, and action sequences take center stage here. They are, in a word AWESOME, and definitely worth spending $9 to have the privilege of watching and experiencing them. See Reloaded as soon as possible, but watch The Matrix beforehand for a better experience. I give this one a 10 rating, which I don't normally do lightly.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I won't give anything away, don't worry. I just want to set some expectations. The first matrix is definitely way more rich in terms of story... the first one was an adventure of learning about the environment, the history, the struggle...   However...beleive me there is enough story in the second that your brain would hemorage if there was anymore. I still have to sit down and think about the situation. But the people I went with who had only seen the matrix once or twice back in 99... they were struggling to keep on tap with the sequel's story.   I asked myself in the movie...was it up to my expectations. I dunno. But then I ask myself, what more would I have wanted. I can't think of a single thing. The things that were said, the ending, it changes everything we knew about the MATRIX. The whole situation is far more complex now (ie more interesting).Wow...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The FX are even better in this sequel and so is the action. The story isn't as good as the first but I think the reason for that is that the first one sets the stage so well that all this movie has to contribute to the story is a little bit of development. This movie does a good job, it's unlike the original but I believe it does justice to it. The acting again is pretty good, but Keanu Reeves doesn't do as well as he did in the first one, which I think was his best movie. He looses some steam in this one but other performances do as well, so it doesn't really show. Another good Matrix movie. 9/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Where did it go wrong and why did it go wrong so badly? I am tempted to say that $$$$$$$$ was the primary factor in deciding to make two sequels and those people who maintain that all three movies are part of one film (as in LOTR) are deluding themselves. The pseudo psycho babble dialogue is so confusing that even the actors admitted they didn't understand a lot of it but they reassured us that the Wachowski's had all the answers. Great, but if you don't even understand the question that isn't much help. The opening orgy scene in Zion just makes you think - why on earth would anyone want to save these degenerate ravers? I suddenly and shockingly found myself in agreement with Agent Smith when he said in the original Matrix that humans are the disease or virus and the agents and machines are the cure. By the end of it you got the feeling that even the actors couldn't care less.After watching the abysmal Alien 3, I decided that I would pretend that it never existed and that the brilliant Aliens was in fact how Ripley, Newt and Hicks signed off. Likewise with the Matrix Reloaded, I think I will just forget that I have ever watched this abomination of a movie and regard Agent Smith's demise at the end of the original movie as the best way to remember that incredible film.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

I cannot believe some people say the script is weak... perhaps it is weak for those who are a bit weak intellectually themselves.

Automatically, people compared it with The Matrix and disappointed. However, this is not just another action movie, another thriller or another science fiction. This is Matrix! The opening scene repeats the first movie, but somehow impresses you. The dream of Neo is very inventive. Action in The Matrix Reloaded is not forgettable, not mild, not less. Content, story, atmosphere or action is peculiar to Matrix world (or should I say the directors) which, to me, make it difficult to say bad. Sometimes, people call some action movies non stop action, although, they are very slow paced or include less action, but The Matrix Reloaded is a great action movie apart from everything, but not shallow or hollow at the same time. In contrast, I disappointed in 2003 when I saw it for the first time at theater, because many action scenes consist of fighting, martial arts rather than gunfights like the first movie. I had expected much more gunfight scene. The action scenes in the first movie were recalling John Woo films, this is a different kind of action, but welcome. Those scenes are flowing, the choreography is almost flawless. There is Daniel Bernhardt who is a B movie star. When I was a child, I used to watch his movies. I wish they casted some other B movie stars such as Frank Zagarino, David Bradley, Marc Dacascos or Gary Daniels. By the way, at first, Wachowski Brothers had chose Jet Li for Seraph character, but they failed to agree with him. Jet Li in Matrix. It sounds great of course, even if the screen time of this character is very less. He was not an interesting character either, so in fact not a big loss. Zion was the most disappointing thing in the film. The Zion people are like party people rather than desperate people who wait for being saved. They look happy (and passionate!) The dance scene was bizarre and sometimes unnecessarily sexual, what was the point? It looked like a video clip in MTV. Do Wachowski Brothers try to show that they try to enjoy the life, because they may be killed by the sentinels soon? I don't think so and if it is, not a good idea. The fight scene with tens of Ajan Smith is the longest fighting scene of all times probably, it is too exaggerating, in some moments CGI is eyesore, it seems like animation, some acts are far-fetched, but it is very fun, I watched this sequence times without number. My favorite fighting scene is the one takes place in Merovingian's place. Thanks to Yuen Woo Ping, it is very flowing and great. The most interesting and creative new characters are The Twins. However, they seem a very hard case, very formidable adversaries, they have the potential, but they are not. It seems that the directors are not interested in those characters enough, also their screen time is less. And the car chase scenes. I disappointed a lot when saw it at theater, because I had expected much more, but I still watch it often. It looks showy, for example sunglasses whatever they do, unnecessary slow motions, a heavy music etc. but one of the longest and also best car chases of all times. In The Matrix Reloaded, the question ''what is Matrix?'' is almost answered after Neo enters through the door. This part is very complex, but the essence of Matrix. If in fantasy genre, there is The Lord of the Rings legend, in science fiction genre, there is The Matrix, even if Revolutions was pretty bad.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Of course it is, but this cliff-hanger ending certainly makes it feel like a soap opera/sci-fi/mini-series. With regards to the film, I have to say that although it is not high art, it is entertaining. I had a great time and just tuned out when the sci-fi Star Trek talk got too laborious. I have to say though, I didn't love this film like I did the first one. I wasn't blown away. It really did seem like the TV series version of a really good movie. Now we have to wait until next season (Revolutions) to see what happens- which by the way I THINK I KNOW BUT I'M NOT TELLING!Trinity is beyond hot- every man's dream. Warm, beautiful, caring, sexy, kicks ass- Neo is a lucky savior indeed. I have to say though, my favorite character was Link. He was the most human and has a great line- (""Where's my...) Nope, won't give that one away either. Good story but not as universally appealing as the first one. Kind of like the new Star Wars movies or just Star Trek in general. Better than Attack of the Clones by far but nowhere near as good as Two Towers- (not much is).

Some neat special effects, but very slow moving.Unlike the first Matrix, which had you riveted to the seat, the beginning of this movie was heavily laden on dialogue and building on the interaction between Trinity and Neo.  Way overdone, the movie pace actually slows down and is way overdone in this regards.The fight scenes are similar to what we saw in Matrix 1, however, speed it up and add some explosions, and that's what you are seeing in the Matrix Reloaded.  Some of the scenes tend to be dragged out beyond what is necessary.2.  What's up with Smith?He had such a great part in 1, that he is back in Reloaded with some new special effects.  Quite exciting earlier on, yet nowhere within the movie has it really explained how he got there and how he returned.  In addition, the viewer really can't figure out how he can do some of the things that's going on.3.  My two cents, is that the most unique part was the last 5 minutes. This movie appears to be a setup movie for the 3rd.  Forget the hype on this one, hype the third one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, as the projectionist, that wasn't an option. A good science fiction film should stand up to viewing in a non- science fiction setting. Like any other film, the important things are believable and interesting characters in a believable and interesting story. The science fiction aspect is simply an added  layer. It is a setting - that's all. When a film relies on ""Special effects"" and wouldn't be interesting without them, It's a lousy film.""Matrix Reloaded"", were it not for the endless ""Special Effects"" fight scenes, would not have any reason to exist. I put Special Effects in quotes, because actually they weren't really special at all.The first time he froze time in mid-air or stopped bullets with his bare hands, those effects were special. The second time you see them they are a novelty. Each time you see them they are less special. After you've seen someone physically change into Agent Smith a dozen times, there's nothing special about it!All those things were in the first film, and were indeed special when first seen. In this sequel, the endless fight scenes that featured those ""No longer special"" effects were simply boring.If you just want to see a lot of gratuitous computer effects and don't care about characters or story, then by all means rush out and see this film! As for me, I'm just glad I got paid to sit there instead of having to pay!   : )","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

Especially considering that it will unavoidably be compared to the first one.  I really thought the ""Matrix"" was phenomenal.  The special effects seemed believably real and the ideas and storyline presented were captivating. ""Reloaded"", in my opinion, did a good job to owning up to this.However, I was bothered by a few things.  The major one being the fight scene between Neo and Smith.  I loved the first matrix because their wasn't all that excessive CGI fighting.  This fight scene, although good during some parts, is badly clobbered in CGI.  It's extremely fake looking in some parts which always drives me nuts and takes away from the movie.  It gave me creepy ""Spider Man"" flash backs (shudders).  Besides that one fight scene, though, everything else looked great and was just as good as the first in the special effects department.I also want to mention that the superman thing with Neo at the end of ""the Matrix"" had me worried but I believe they really pulled it off in ""Reloaded"" so that it didn't look cheesy.  But that's just me because other people would most defiantly disagree. :o)The second thing was the extremely long dancing in the cavern scene.  I don't know whether their motives for this scene was to incorporate the rave scene from the first movie into the second or simply to sex it up but it really wasn't that efficient.The other thing is the philosophical blah blah blah.  It may make more sense when watched a few more times but if you only watch it once it makes you go ""Huh?"".  But the philosophical blah blah blah and the dance scene don't last forever and are not bad enough to make this movie a horrid creation or anything close for that matter. Also, I do not believe the script was strained or forced as some people have said.  Everything in the movie seemed to have a purpose and had a nice flowing continuity.The other big complaint I here from people is the ending and the unanswered questions. However, this didn't bother me. The unanswered questions will very likely be answered in ""Revolutions""  and the ending was to be expected. Since they did ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolutions"" together and since both are coming out in the same year it makes sense that they would be tied so closely together unlike ""the Matrix"" and ""Reloaded"" (which was due to the fact they didn't know there was going to be a sequel).  All movies just don't come in a neat little packaged labeled happily ever after and The End.
""Reloaded"" had action, shippiness, humor, intelligence, fun, and lots more. It was extremely good and I would recommend it to everyone who has watched the first one. If not you'll probably get confused. (and if you haven't then go rent it cause it's good!)  Although I wouldn't say it's better than the first...what sequel ever is???, the movie had a ton of great moments which out weigh the bad by far.  I would watch it again and again if I had a chance and I will defiantly buy it when it comes out months from now on DVD. I'm very thankful to everyone involved for making a sequel (and a 3rd one as well) regardless of the bad fight scene (spider man flashbacks again !!SHUDDER!!) because the matrix is too good to only have one movie. It's one of the few movies that actually require people to think but is enjoyable at the same time. ;o)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Where'd I get such a dazzling sense of wit, you ask? I'll tell you. I just saw the Matrix. Basically it's an action man's porno. Some real hot action scenes that don't necessarily connect to each other. Agents just show up every so often so there can be a fight. There's even some actual porno in the beginning. So that's the other thing. No longer can you say it's only rated R because of Columbine, unless Columbine means huge group orgiastic sex scene and a couple three f-words. My recommendation: show up 40 minutes late, you'll skip the sex and the boring boring Zion/rastafarian Ewok village (did I mention boring?) ""important"" ""plot"" ""development,"" and make it just in time for the action scenes, which really are incredible, though in a lot of them they cheated, and you're basically just watching the Wachowski brothers play a really really expensive video game. Which is better than real actual life I suppose. Anyway, make your own decision. But I already know what you'll do.P.S. Maybe it's ironic that I'm against Matrix sex (eeeww, sex in the Matrix, gross!) but I loved Bound. No wait, not ironic--hypocritical, that's the word I'm looking for.Also, the ending was rushed. Also, people can't really fly.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There is even a traitor again. But the story line is dragged much longer and more convoluted in order to carry on with the original plots. The 3 minutes dance and sex scene could be cut out completely. Some scenes also don't match up. In the original Matrix, the crew had to survive on plain soup and yet in Reloaded, everyone enjoyed the a party and a feast.On the up side, the action scenes are superior. Reeves is much more fluid and natural in the new movie. However, the Superman stunts are absolutely uncalled for.

There is some amazing action sequences (which is really the point of the Matrix movies), including the highway chase which punches you in the face with sheer energy and excitement. The so-called Burly Brawl is really cool as well, in which hundreds of Agent Smiths take on a single Neo. Speaking of Agent Smith, Hugo Weaving makes a character almost as cool as Darth Vader.The film has it's fair share of flaws, though. Zion is not a very exciting place, for instance. Nothing really happens there, except for an overlong party, full of slo-mo dancing, and a cheesy speech by Morpheus. I was just waiting for him to yell ""Can you dig it?"". Aside from that, the story writers tried to cram the story lines into conversations that would take a computer technician and a thesaurus to try and understand.Still, The Matrix Reloaded is a great sequel to one of the best sci-fi films ever. It's no Empire Strikes Back, but it is definitely worth the watch for the action sequences, Monica Bellucci, and, of course, Agent Smith. 8/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

If you do, tell me why. Let me guess, it had something to do with too much plot that didn't resolve in a satisfactory way, and the whole movie was just a big action scene. Well hold on. Those isn't a problem with this film, thsose were problem with the third film, The Matrix Revolutions. Interesting how when the film was first released it got pretty good reviews from both critics and audiences, yet after the third film was released, it's called one of the worst sequels of all time. Well I'm sick of it. I'm not saying this movie was as good as the first, not even close. But it certainly a very good sequel, and a damn fun film that doesn't deserve the hate it gets.Basically I don't hate much in this film, it's biggest problem is that most of the aspects of the film are not as good as the first one. The first film had a very interesting and though provoking story. This movie's story is good, but it can get a bit confusing and boring at times. The acting and new characters are more hit and miss. Some of the CGI hasn't aged well. But as a film itself the worst I can say is that it can be a little boring at times, and some things happen without much of an explanation.However I will say that if you didn't like the first Matrix because you thought it was boring, I think you may actually like this one. As much as I love the first movie, the pacing was a bit uneven. In this movie, the pacing is perfect, development, action, development, action, etc. I really like the character of Link, this movie has a great sense of humor, without going to over the top. The story is good, not as great as the first movie, but it sets up a plot to be resolved in the next movie. But the best parts are the action scenes. In the first movie I appreciated the story first, then the action. In this one, the action is simply incredible, despite some aged CG, some of it still looks damn amazing. The kung fu fights are well shot, and beautifly choreographed. And the car chase is one of the best I have ever seen. Seriously, anyone who says this film has nothing good in it should be punched, that scene alone deserved it's own mini Oscar or something.No, this isn't as good as the first movie, but it certainly isn't one of the worst sequels of all time. It set up a good story, and then Revolutions dropped the ball. So I recommend you give it another watch if you haven't watched it since 2003.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They are poorly written, too long, and overblown.

Some scenes are campy and forced.The ending is great it's cool - I did feel that a lot of it was contrived. With sequels you end up with a first movie - complete and original film - and the sequels are contrived (their existence contingent on the success of the first).The first movie is about an A- for me, this one is about a B.

It's a shame the hype surrounding the 'Burly Brawl' was not lived up to - it was just a computer game on the big screen - you could admire the skill of the programmers, but there was no subtlety or 'wow' effect - as there was the first time we saw 'bullet time'. Car chase held my attention, good effects and good editing, but when it came to some of the fights - give me an old Bruce Lee film any day. Despite the vague storyline and the lengthy filler scenes during which I lost the will to live and just wished the machines would get on and finish the job, I actually came out glad that I'd seen it but thankful I'd not paid full price.But you can't help liking poor old Neo, he's a nice enough chap and Reeves hams him up beautifully.

Oh, and some crazy martial arts action that Hong Kong would be proud of.  Really, though, the best part of this movie is the (honestly, hold the laughter, please) deep philosophical questions that get posed.  They deepen the meaning and relation of The Matrix as an entity with our modern technologies.  Some real, applicable man/machine issues are presented.  These scenes are few and far between, but they're thankfully cushioned by cool stunts, lots of bullets and the next generation of the Bullet-Time Effects.

Well, I've seen many movies, thought about this one for a long, long time and THERE IS NO DOUBT: Matrix 2 is the greatest atrocity to film-making ever. No alien race and no era of man - could ever produce a movie worse than this. I could only imagine someone disagreeing with me if they have seen Matrix 3. If you have, I feel deeply sorry for you, even more so than the shared sorrow you must feel for me, knowing that I too have sat through this utter refuse.Compared to this, ""Howard the Duck"" has a plot like the ""Godfather"", ""Scooby Doo"" had special effects as good as ""The Lord of the Rings"", ""Glitter"" had the impact of ""Apocalypse Now"", ""The Spice Movie"" had acting like ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""Gigli"" had the power of ""Platoon"". Everything about this movie is an utter travesty - and it takes itself so seriously that it is a capital crime against the human intellect.Some say it has classical references. I have a degree in classics and post-grad research in literature and can say with certainty that this pile of trash is an insult to every theme and philosophy it inanely goes in sight of. This movie was so numbing I did not have the strength to laugh; it was so preposterous I didn't have the will to cry. It simply left me feeling angry for having been so misused to sit through such nonsense; I honestly felt like I had been intellectually violated.Despite my moral opposition to censorship, I strongly recommend all copies of this movie be burned, along with it's successor.The first Matrix was OK though.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

When the machines begin digging to the underground human city of Zion, Zion's leadership believes it's best that all ships should return to Zion and prepare for defense against the impending invasion. Morpheus however steadfast in his belief in the prophecy and trust in Neo organizes his team to go back into The Matrix where the long awaited message is delivered from the Oracle (Gloria Foster) that they must access the mainframe. However along with upgrades in The Matrix's agents, the seemingly destroyed Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) has returned more powerful than ever.Following the massive success of the first Matrix film, Warner Bros. Quickly struck while the iron was hot bringing back both The Wachowskis and Keanu Reeves for two back to back sequels with most of the cast soon following suit. Originally envisioned to be followed by one prequel film and one sequel, it was decided that the sequels would be a two parter detailing the last stand of Zion against the Machine invasion. When the first part, The Matrix Reloaded was released in May 2003, it broke records for the biggest R-rated movie at the box office previously held by Terminator 2: Judgement Day and would not be broken again until 2016 with the release of Deadpool. While reviews of the film skewed (mostly) positive at the time, there was a feeling that Reloaded was a step down in quality from the first film. The movie was also criticized for its overstuffed exposition and dangling plot threads and cliffhanger ending which were pretty naked attempts to set up ancillary franchise material like The Animatrix, the video game Enter the Matrix, and of course the second part The Matrix Revolutions. While The Matrix Reloaded does boast some solid elements and memorable scenes, it also often succumbs to the weight of its own bloat and excess.As with the first film, the production design, effects, and action are spot on with the human city of Zion only hinted at in the first film now fully realized and the movie is given a larger sense of scope and scale than the first film had. The movie also tries to bring up twists on its ""chosen one"" narrative with Morpheus' status as a true believer contrasted against the more cynical and grounded elements of Zion such as Harry Lennix's commander Lock or more on the fence elements such as Anthony Zerbe as Councillor Hamann. The action scenes also go for more elaborate and large scale sequences such as the ""money shot"" where Neo finds himself fighting against multiple copies of Agent Smith which is really well done.What doesn't work is the lack of a core like we had in the first film. While the first The Matrix didn't have the greatest depth when it came to character, it had a strong enough core to compensate with Thomas Anderson/Neo's journey of an everyman learning his world is a lie and dealing with the fallout from that and going on a journey both personal and literal to find out if he was The One. Most of Neo's scenes in this film consist of him dealing with the pressures of being The One (with multiple scenes of Zion's denizens bringing offerings to him and asking him for protection of their loved ones) or chasing McGuffins whose purposes aren't made clear. Most of this movie is a barrage of exposition broken up by fight scenes but the characters aren't engaging enough to overcome the dry exposition and the fight scenes are so overly long that it becomes exhausting to watch. One sequence where our characters encounter a character known as the Merovingian leads to what feels like a 20 minute long stretch of action. The fact that Neo also retains his nigh invincibility poses problems for creating tension which is probably why the filmmakers routinely sideline him because he has ""god mode"" on with only the legions of Agent Smith posing any real threat.The Matrix Reloaded has some good scenes, but it's so burdened by exposition and non-stop action sequences that it loses a lot of the appeal it got from the personal journey and memorable (if clunky and unsubtle) themes it tackled. While there are moments where we get glimpses of that such as The Architect Scene, more often than not it feels like a streamlined larger scale version of the first film without the novelty.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Having seen the film as soon as I possibly could, I am quite happy to let others watch it without having anything lost from the intrinsic mystery.

Therefore I will not reveal a thing about this film; all I will say is that I have given it a rating of 10/10 only because that's as high as I'm allowed to.

"6","/10","Reloaded and somewhat annoyingly re-envisaged, but The Matrix Reloaded does suffice on certain levels of spectacle and ideas.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2224708/?ref_=tt_urv","johnnyboyz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0855231/?ref_=tt_urv","22 March 2010","The Matrix Reloaded feigns as if it sets out a particular stall early on, with some absurd content that consists of a stunt involving a motorcycle spinning through the air; landing into a building; blowing up profusely as a skin tight leather outfit clad female lands on the hard concrete floor, from an initially elevated position, and all of it in slow motion. What follows is an off the wall gunfight as further slow motion encompasses two individuals crashing through a window of a high-rise. But it was a dream; a blending of images of an escapist and impossible nature as the body rests but the mind rages on during the night in an overwhelming surge of imagery and sound – or was it? The Wachowski brothers' 2003 sequel to their hit 1999 film The Matrix is a science-fiction action hybrid which combines far more than two primary genres. Rich in ideas; high in kinetic entertainment and with a sufficient study of character, The Matrix Reloaded just about works.The first Matrix film was a very old, very classical and rather mythical story of a humble character brought out of his commonplace surroundings quite amazingly, which saw him reborn into a new world; a supremely disturbing reality full of new dangers and new ways of life; a place with both superior technology and enemies. It blended age-old story convention with a very old fashioned idea at the heart of it all (one that revolved around a 'prophecy' and a 'chosen one') with eerily contemporary mise-en-scene in its costume and technologically driven props. The Matrix Reloaded feeds off of that gross sense of hybridity the first film had; that combining of story-telling in the sense there is that core narrative idea to do with a prophecy coming true with more modern, slick conventions.If the first film had its bleary eyed protagonist Neo (Reeves) leave a familiar 'real' world and enter a new existence in an alternate dimension, then The Matrix Reloaded is more preoccupied with reversing that process. Here, rather than play the bland office worker turned mankind's saviour; he is the emotionally troubled individual attempting to deal with nightmares, maintain his relationship with Trinity (Moss) and the burden of said role as he mopes around in clothes that look like rags and embodies tender, soft-bodied traits. This is the flip-side to the life he leads when he and the freedom fighting minions consisting of old guards Trinity and Morpheus (Fishburne), amongst others, jump into the now newly rendered 'false' universe in which action; gunfights; awe-inspiring stunts and the very anti-thesis to realism unfold. In this existence, clothing; ability and general look take on a more falsifying nature as issues of a more personal nature are shelved for broader, more extravagant stakes. The process is not unlike booting up a video game, with intent to escape from whatever existence one inhabits in order to suit up as someone else: a soldier; a gangster; a professional golfer, football star or winter Olympian – all so that the chance is presented so as to take on more escapist themed odds than in a 'real' existence.The world in which most of the 'real' drama The Matrix Reloaded unfolds is one that sees its inhabitants wear clothes akin to caveman era rags, with the dwelling in caves a pretty dominant way of living as the place is lit by way of flamed torches. The setting is positively Jurassic, but the Wachowski's upturn the cart by including a contemporary rave party amidst all this, with another amusing moment capturing the blending of 'old' and 'new', itself within an action sequence, when Neo battles a group of enemies with medieval weaponry in a plush locale whilst incorporating modern martial arts. Whatever plot the film has concerns an army of killer machines known as Sentinels, those squid-like war machines from the first film, and whom are designed to destroy everything and everyone in their path. The moments in which they're on screen are sparse, but frightening on the off occasion it happens. These Sentinels are on their way to destroy Zion; the dwelling of humankind within this Matrix universe.The film's sense of both flash and urgency are exemplified in its race against time premise, a situation that sees the leads battle against the clock; 72 hours - an amount of time which is just long enough to get everything done as they strive to save the day and defeat the...........well, you know how it all goes. In an attempt to inject some heart into proceedings, the film covers Neo's continuing personal problems and Morpheus' direct opposition with a local commander named Lock (Lennix), both ideologically and personally when it's revealed he's someone whom rejects Morpheus' faith in the prophecy as he additionally engages in a relationship with Niobe (Smith), Morpheus' former partner.The Matrix Reloaded is ultimately an ambitious actioner, veering off into ""2001"" territory when an interaction with someone known as The Architect (Bakaitis) crops up; but you smirk at the sheer pomposity of the nature of the sequence as well as the direction the film has hairpin-turned down more than you do sit and admire a carefully observed piece which has beautifully woven its way to this point. I think the film wants to observe how man and machine co-exist, or can co-exist, within this universe, or a universe; but rather than play the thesis out in a subtle and relaxed manner; a certain character of the 'wise-old-head' ilk has to come on screen and explain everything to an insomnia suffering Neo. The film borders on near camp following an interaction with an eccentric Frenchman complete with Monica Bellucci pouring out of a dress while a combat sequence between Neo and a number of Agent Smiths sums up the complete ignoring of the simplistic, menacing, less-is-more aura the first one had in regards to said threat. Tiring, but Reloaded pulls through.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Some action scenes were so long as to lose their initial flair and became quite simply..redundant.  The dialogue also flutters between bar none and just plain cheesy.  For example, Morpheus's speech before the rave scene was about as bad as they come.  All in all, it is an amazing movie that became victim to its own gross excessiveness.

It had a nonsensical story, but the good action sequences more than made up for this, and the story had some really clever parts like ""deja vus"" being glitches in the Matrix. Now, four years later the sequel has arrived and it certainly delivers what most people wanted it to deliver: extremely stylish and spectacular action sequences. Though not all of them are equally interesting, some of them like the highway chase and the fight with 30+ ""Mr Smiths"" are technical masterpieces, and very exciting. Occasionally, things get a bit ridiculous, like when Neo is suddenly able to fly (who is he, Superman?), but this is forgivable given the fact that it could have probably be a whole lot worse.In term of story though, ""the Matrix Reloaded"" screws up big time. I don't know how they did it, but somehow the writers came up with something that's ten times more far-fetched, confusing, and unlikely than the first movie, which was already stretching the bounds of credibility. The story is certainly creative, but it's covered in such a load of heavy quasi-philosophical dialogue and computer-related mumbo-jumbo that it's way too heavy for an action movie (or practically any other movie, for that matter). Also, why on earth does this movie contain a pointless five-minute party scene which could double for the world's largest R & B clip? It was so utterly out of place and boring that I have no idea what the creators were thinking. Did they have some extra budget left or something? In that case, they should have probably spent it to improve the story instead of wasting it on pointless interludes.Anyway, this movie would have probably been a lot better off if it had just tried to be an action movie with a simple (but credible) plot and breathtaking action sequences. Instead, we get a movie that tries to pass itself off as a deep work of philosophy, but fails for the most part.All in all, not a terrible movie (the action makes it worthwile) but ultimately too vague and confusing to be really good.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The story didn't engage me like the first one did and so that impacted upon the whole film. The twaddle of Councils and ethics (a la Star Trek or Star Wars) dragged the story and the pace down and left me yawning in places.On a positive note there were awesome fight scenes and humour was well used. Two new ghostly baddies enhanced the film, it's just a shame they weren't used more in place of the philosophical ponderings of Councils and officialdom.Bottom line is that if you're already a Matrix fan I don't need to tell you to go see it. If you're not, see the first one and then decide. If that doesn't grab you, this one certainly won't.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie has it's moments too and some very well dialogues (as Neo/Oracle, Neo/Architect). Action and effects are a bit over-dosed, Morpheus is not so effective as in first movie.Result: OK for a sequel and considering that we still haven't seen the second part of the movie (Revolutions), it's worth waiting till November before we say the last word.PS: The rave scene in Zion was fantastic, opposite of everybody's opinion. Although I don't listen anything than rock, this scene and love between Neo-Trinity summarizes lots of things for a careful Matrix fan. (E.g. you would have noticed there were lots of african-asian-indian in Zion. Maybe that's because ordinary white guys from western countries can't get out of the Matrix so easily. They have a lot to blind them: career, relationships, luxury etc. Just remember what Cypher says in first movie: ignorance is bliss for them...)PS II: This film desperately needs Cypher.

The leads, Keanu Reeves as hero 'Neo', Carrie Anne Moss as 'Trinity' and Laurence Fishburne as 'Morpheus', manage to do exceptionally well with the mediocre material and continue to build on their signature roles.
Along with solid lead performances, a thrilling freeway chase scene and some dazzling special effects help save ""The Matrix Reloaded"" from being a total anti-climactic experience. One can only hope that the final chapter of the trilogy, ""The Matrix Revolutions"", makes up for the weaknesses of this sophomore outing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As everyone I really looked forward to the sequence to the Matrix. Despite bad reviews I went and see the film with the idea to just enjoy the best action scenes money can buy, and I did.The Matrix Reloaded didn't give the rush of excitement as the first one did. Why? The inbetween scenes where a little bid too long and the editing was unlucky. It is both a sequel and a lead-in towards the Matrix Revolutions. Movie rules would say that can't be good, and it isn't. The newness which was there in the first, wasn't there in the second. Then why can the most expensive movie up to now not be good. My thought is :marketing. The longest and most expensive trailer ever. For where there is good there has to be bad. They make the second movie in the trilogy likeable but not good, so the third one is at least going to be better than the second. They know they are not going to be able to repeat the level of the first one because it was the newness which made the Matrix good. All the money in the world can't bring that. This is their solution. The producer's solution to just make more money.

Normally though, no matter how bad of acting or how corny the plot may be, with a summer blockbuster you can fall back to the action.  But I was disappointed in that too.  One of the coolest fight scenes you can obviously see that Neo is actually computerized.  And almost all off the other scenes almost seem to be imitating all the movies that ripped off the matrix. The action scenes no longer seem like Matrix authentic, it seems that they have sold out on their own originality.  Although the movie was watchable, even enjoyable, it did not leave me wishing to go see the next installment. Instead, it left me wishing that I hadn't seen this installment.

We are all part of a large computer program. It is not the year we think it is. Most humans believe it is the year 2003 but rather it is the year 2099 or something close to that. Machines have taken control of the world and most humans are tapped into a thing called The Matrix. Pretty weird, huh? Well, the strange premise of The Matrix caught on in 1999 and now the first sequel has been declared the movie event of 2003. Though the sequel, like its predecessor, is rated R, the highly anticipated film is still expected to break box office records faster then any other movie. It is even expected to challenge Titanic for the highest grossing film title. A huge amount of hype has been placed on the film. Fanatics have been surfing the web and chatting how excited they are about this film. You couldn't go into a movie without seeing at least a teaser trailer for the film. Now that the film has finally arrived in movie theaters across the country and soon the world, will The Matrix Reloaded live up to the hype?The story for The Matrix Reloaded does not exactly take up where the original left off. To fully understand what is going on, one must rent The Animatrix on DVD and play the Enter the Matrix game but let us say that we are not all huge fanatics like the rest of the world. Here is the simple and basic story line for The Matrix Reloaded: It is the year 2099 and man is fighting an ongoing battle with machines. Machines gained control of the world and put humans into slavery. They built a computer program called The Matrix which all are connected to except for a small few. Those small few would include Morpheus, Trinity, Neo and the people of Zion, the last human stronghold. They are continuing their fight against The Matrix and searching for the answer to this question: Why are we here? Why are doing what we do? Why us? That is as simple as you can get about this premise without confusing somebody or giving away most of the movie. It is highly recommended that you not see this film unless you have seen the original The Matrix. The story can be confusing even to those that have seen the original but it is still excellently done. It is amazing how intricate and complex the plot is that there is not a single action within the course of the film that does not have a significant action later on either in this film or in the next.The cast of The Matrix Reloaded is wonderful as it is expanded significantly from the original film. Keanu Reeves is perfectly cast as the role of Neo or The One. There was some question with the original if he could handle such an important role as this but Reeves totally proves his acting worth not only in the original but also in this film. Carrie-Ann Moss is great as Trinity. Her role is placed more center stage in this film allowing more screen time and more importance then some thought in the original film. Laurence Fishburne is, accourse, delightful as Morpheus. Fishburne is able to show more emotion with character this time around though not too much away from the normal emotions Morpheus had in the first movie. Jada Pinkett Smith is okay but one would think that her role will be bigger in The Matrix Revolutions. Monica Belluci's role is nothing more then eye candy for the young males. Her acting range is never really seen which is quite disappointing with such good word coming from her foreign films.The Matrix Reloaded is definitely the movie event of the summer but not quite as perfect as all the hype said it would be. As great as it is there are some things to pick at. What is with the constant huge kissing scenes between Neo and Trinity? Almost every time they are alone they are eating each other's face. I think after the first kissing scene we would have gotten the idea that they are in love with each other. Another thing that was a problem was the orgy scene in the city of Zion. Was that truly necessary? It went from being a totally sci-fi film to this porno flick. What was the deal with all the sexual references within the course of the film in general? Are they that desperate to attract and appeal to young teenage boys that almost every other scene has to include a sexual action or comment? You would think that this kind of film would be above all of that but guess not. Other then those comment, The Matrix Reloaded is definitely the film to see this summer. One should see this film for the special effects alone. Absolutely amazing though in parts they seemed a little much especially with the fight between Neo and the multiple Agent Smiths. The Matrix Reloaded is not perfect by any standards but maybe that is what the film makers intended it to be. It is only half a film. Remember to stick around after the credits to check out a short preview of The Matrix Revolutions opening in theaters on November 5th, 2003.My Rating: ****1/2 out of 5 (Grade: A)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I understand the legitimacy of the films as very little has been seen that is equal to these films. There are rumors that the film was not fun to shoot, partly due to the Warchowski sibling couple's way of directing the film, but also due to the great pressure on the film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In this 2nd installment, ""Matrix Reloaded,"" fails to make necessary emotional connection to its jaw-dropping visual effects, resulting in a dramatically flat 'middle' trilogy.  In the first, the cool action sequences served to introduce our characters as super beings, once in the Matrix.  In this one, while the action sequences are still pretty cool, now feel long and pointless.  Combine this with the film's ambitious effort to bring Greek mythology, Christianity, Buddhism, Marxism and nihilism together in a cryptic way as not to reveal too much in light of the next, conclusive install resulted in an even film.  The success of ""Matrix Reloaded"" should be attributed more to its brilliant marketing strategy than the film itself, which grossed some $160 million opening week worldwide.

The first time I watched it was long after it had been released and I had heard so much about it that I think my expectations were too high. Upon repeat viewings, I grew to appreciate it more and more. It's still not in my top ten but an enjoyable movie none the less. After seeing Reloaded, my appreciation for the original increased ten fold.I'm sure I will be burned at the stake for saying it, but I really didn't care to much for Reloaded. Not from a visual stand point, it looks amazing, and not because of the acting. I just found myself losing interest in the story. The opening was slow. With the exception of the freeway scene, which I loved, the action scenes seemed to drag on a bit long. and I felt that they were to few and far between. The story itself just couldn't hold my interest.I guess, to make a long story short, I think that the first one was a great stand alone movie that didn't need a sequel. I almost felt as I watched this one that it was only made to make money. If I didn't need the closure because of the cliff hanger ending, I probably wouldn't see the third one. I'm not saying that it was a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination, the direction the story is taking just doesn't appeal to me.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

THe fights were spectacular and the characters had much more depth than the last movie. Some have commented that it takes too long to get going, but I disagree. In the original Matrix, it's nothing but Neo waking up for half an hour straight and laurence fishburne talking with a weird smile and sitting in a crappy red chair. They talk a lot in this movie too, but what they say is interesting! IT answers so much that the other film left hanging. There were only two flaws that I could find: The awful sex scene during the rave (That really wasn't necessary). The other involved the car chase. NOw don't get me wrong; the chase itself was excellent and well-choreographed. But I realized about halfway through that all the cars they were using were made by GM. A twin shoots through a chevy tahoe, the cops all drove Chevy Impalas, and the agent jumps on an Oldsmobile Intrigue. The only non-GM car in the movie was the Audi A8 taht the Agents drove.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Admittedly, there are a series of very well-executed special effects in the movie. The fighting is great, though where Neo battles a crowd of identical opponents with a pole, the Brothers seem to have watched too closely how Sauron unconvincing batted enemies around in that other blockbuster. Where this movie goes wrong is in over-exposition. On at least four occasions, secondary characters are given ample opportunity to explain at length what the movie is about. These bits are just plain boring, though the underlying philosophical questions are fascinating in themselves. Also, there's a fair bit of utterly pointless sexuality, as well as a very lame secondary love plot. Nevertheless, this movie tells the middle part of the Matrix trilogy and as such is worth seeing, if only to connect the other two. If you liked the Matrix and are eagerly expecting Revolutions, you'll have to see this too. If you're not that interested and thought Matrix was the high point in cinematic history, you might be better off skipping this episode and just hope to make sense of part three. (Then again, you might even choose to wait until I've seen Revolutions and base your decision on what I say about that one... :-) )","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

We as the audience could relate to him.In Reloaded, all that's gone and it's far more driven by modern intrigue and war between human and the machines. Not that this is a bad thing, but again, it takes away the viewers sense of being able to relate.However, as a sci-fi action (oh my, the action) film, it's one of the more spellbinding films I've seen. The effects are stunning, primarily because they have to use real people throughout the majority of the film, not just relying on computer generation.The story is generic, but still acceptable and we do not lose sight of Neo as a person, as opposed to being just a warrior or ""savior"". This film is far sexier than the first and more bold in terms of adult themes, which I was thankful for. I hate it when good films are downplayed to reach a broader audience. The creators of the film keep the mood and genre very consistent with what you'd expect. They also did a good job of making Neo seem unstoppable, as he seemed to be in the end of the first film, but still vulnerable because of his human nature.I gave this one a high rating, for pure entertainment value alone. I will be curious to see the third installment, so the full story is complete. However, I suspect it will be much of the same as Reloaded.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This film was a bit too long, with scenes that appeared to be loosely connected to each other without a real flow to them.  I was ESPECIALLY disappointed with the special effects.  While some of them were spectacular (all car scenes, the evil twin scenes), others (Neo's fight scene with the multiple Smiths, and other scenes where the actors were replaced by computer animation) were extremely bad.  I don't know what made them imagine that those graphics were even passable for real actors, but they were not.  In short, one minute you have actors facing off, the next minute you are watching a video game on the big screen, which broke any sense of suspended disbelief you had developed till that point.  I can still recommend this film for viewing, I gave it a 7 and it was entertaining, but watching the awful animation in this film and others like the Hulk makes me quite concerned about a decidedly bad era of movie special effects driven by the movie maker's belief that their audience is too stupid or blind to tell good effects from a cartoon.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As for me, I am so amazed by the many theories that can be built from this film: Is this matrix inside another matrix? Is Neo a program?  Why is Neo in a coma? The Oracle said that the French guy is a program; then he must be the fifth version of `The One' if `The One' is actually a program?! What is the machine's fall back plan if the entire human race were to be wiped out? Is the change in Agent Smith a design or an unexpected event in the machine's strategy?  Since the two choices given to Neo are obviously under the machines control, could there be a third choice?  You will have endless questions if you carefully listen to their conversation and observe the details closely.

Well, the strange premise of The Matrix caught on in 1999 and now the first sequel has been declared the movie event of 2003. Though the sequel, like its predecessor, is rated R, the highly anticipated film is still expected to break box office records faster then any other movie. It is even expected to challenge Titanic for the highest grossing film title. A huge amount of hype has been placed on the film. Fanatics have been surfing the web and chatting how excited they are about this film. You couldn't go into a movie without seeing at least a teaser trailer for the film. Now that the film has finally arrived in movie theaters across the country and soon the world, will The Matrix Reloaded live up to the hype?The story for The Matrix Reloaded does not exactly take up where the original left off. To fully understand what is going on, one must rent The Animatrix on DVD and play the Enter the Matrix game but let us say that we are not all huge fanatics like the rest of the world. Here is the simple and basic story line for The Matrix Reloaded: It is the year 2099 and man is fighting an ongoing battle with machines. Machines gained control of the world and put humans into slavery. They built a computer program called The Matrix which all are connected to except for a small few. Those small few would include Morpheus, Trinity, Neo and the people of Zion, the last human stronghold. They are continuing their fight against The Matrix and searching for the answer to this question: Why are we here? Why are doing what we do? Why us? That is as simple as you can get about this premise without confusing somebody or giving away most of the movie. It is highly recommended that you not see this film unless you have seen the original The Matrix. The story can be confusing even to those that have seen the original but it is still excellently done. It is amazing how intricate and complex the plot is that there is not a single action within the course of the film that does not have a significant action later on either in this film or in the next.The cast of The Matrix Reloaded is wonderful as it is expanded significantly from the original film. Keanu Reeves is perfectly cast as the role of Neo or The One. There was some question with the original if he could handle such an important role as this but Reeves totally proves his acting worth not only in the original but also in this film. Carrie-Ann Moss is great as Trinity. Her role is placed more center stage in this film allowing more screen time and more importance then some thought in the original film. Laurence Fishburne is, accourse, delightful as Morpheus. Fishburne is able to show more emotion with character this time around though not too much away from the normal emotions Morpheus had in the first movie. Jada Pinkett Smith is okay but one would think that her role will be bigger in The Matrix Revolutions. Monica Belluci's role is nothing more then eye candy for the young males. Her acting range is never really seen which is quite disappointing with such good word coming from her foreign films.The Matrix Reloaded is definitely the movie event of the summer but not quite as perfect as all the hype said it would be. As great as it is there are some things to pick at. What is with the constant huge kissing scenes between Neo and Trinity? Almost every time they are alone they are eating each other's face. I think after the first kissing scene we would have gotten the idea that they are in love with each other. Another thing that was a problem was the orgy scene in the city of Zion. Was that truly necessary? It went from being a totally sci-fi film to this porno flick. What was the deal with all the sexual references within the course of the film in general? Are they that desperate to attract and appeal to young teenage boys that almost every other scene has to include a sexual action or comment? You would think that this kind of film would be above all of that but guess not. Other then those comment, The Matrix Reloaded is definitely the film to see this summer. One should see this film for the special effects alone. Absolutely amazing though in parts they seemed a little much especially with the fight between Neo and the multiple Agent Smiths. The Matrix Reloaded is not perfect by any standards but maybe that is what the film makers intended it to be. It is only half a film. Remember to stick around after the credits to check out a short preview of The Matrix Revolutions opening in theaters on November 5th, 2003.My Rating: ****1/2 out of 5 (Grade: A)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Matrix 2 is like a totally different movie than matrix 1, if the actors weren't the same I'm not even sure anyone would have linked them. I still like the idea behind this franchise tho.

Apparently, that is how most people felt. Then, with this movie, everybody went into ""This movie can't possibly be as good as the first."" Good for them, but those of us who strove to maintain objectivity got more out of Reloaded than those. My perfect example: There was a half row of idiots behind me in the theater, snickering at every character development scene throughout the movie... from the first second of the flick. I wanted to turn around and tell them ""I'm glad that you felt it necessary to spend money to watch a movie which you had already formed an opinion about. Now could you please let the rest of us enjoy it?"" This is a symptomatic case, I think. As far as the movie itself goes: Reloaded makes the first movie even better. This is a much more cerebral movie than the first, so I don't expect it will enjoy as much acclaim. This is too bad, but the lowest common denominator always rules at the movies. The viewing experience I can most identify Reloaded with is ""Eyes Wide Shut"". For the first two-thirds of the movie, you think you know what's going on and it isn't all that exciting. And then, in one second, your brain is blown away as you are finally presented with the point of the movie, and it rules. Reloaded is one of the best movies of the past five years. ""The Matrix"" built up hopes for the continuation of the series, but I doubt anybody had any real idea of what the Wachowski brothers could do. Reloaded is superb, and I would recommend it to any thinking moviegoer.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The special FX are awesome but that's a trouble too, the film looks now like a video game for play station or something. The sex scene between Neo and trinity goes to trash can for better the montage with the tribal techno dance with the people for Zion too... Those two scenes can be erased and the movie doesn't change... The dream of Neo as the first sequence is so the same old thing... It's predictable... The movie must begun in the meeting on the captains of the ships, when neo fight three agents in the alley and then flies away, that would be a good initial sequence...

The effects shots are great, but might leave some viewers disappointed.  The effects that were so great in the first movie almost seem over-used in the sequel, and the expectations for something even better might not be met.For those looking for the deeper philosophical layering of the original, it's there, but it has lost its ""wow"" factor.  The meaning of life is not in this movie, and though some might walk into the theater expecting it to be, it certainly won't be found here.Personally, I loved the movie.  Perhaps because I walked in with a lower expectation than others.  I found this to be a ""must-watch"" movie.

Its not a religion or a way of life. So maybe everybody was expecting too much from The Matrix Reloaded. Its not going to change the world; its not even going to change anybody's life. There's no doubt that this film has its flaws. These are already thoroughly documented here so there's no point in me rehashing what has already been said (and very well said, I might add).But as action films go, this is second to none. Forget the script, because some of it is really awful (Morpheus' speech in Zion is really cringe-inducing). This film is about action, and lots of it. The set pieces are amazing, the fight scenes are truly brilliant and the special effects really push the boundaries. The plot is pretty complicated, (and has a couple of holes, particularly in relation to the ending of the last film) but you'll have great fun puzzling it out for days after you watch the film. Be warned, though, it is slow to start. Its about 45 minutes into the film before things start hotting up.Overall, a great piece of cinema that builds well on a brilliant original. Don't be put off by the poor reviews. Its a joy to watch, and those action scenes will leave you breathless. I rated it 8 out of 10. I can't wait for Revolutions.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There are engrossing themes but not all are sewn up in the same way the first one's were. But some questions you may encounter this time are: how deep is the Matrix?; are Neo's powers part of his fate, or one that he chooses with his free will?; does civilization end to begin again with a new v. 2·0 of the program or can we, indeed, steer us away from destruction?; and what is reality outside the Matrix (I won't elaborate on this, but it's an issue I was left with in the closing moments)? Maybe these are appropriate things to be thinking in 2003.That, and how beautiful Monica Bellucci is.But this sequel does not appeal to the (remaining) senses as deeply as the first film had done. I didn't walk away from The Matrix Reloaded with the same, 'What if that were our reality?'  the same immersion  as the first one gave me. Instead, it was a few hours' worth of stunning set pieces that had me marvelling at the movie's special visual effects, a great score, and General Motors' product placement in the car chase scene. But I was not immersed. So often you come out of a film bringing a bit of its world out with you. Not here.Maybe it's the absence of surprise that comes with a sequel. I don't blame anyone for that: it's perfectly natural. In fact, I applaud the Wachowskis for not detracting from the movie's original style, tying it in to the spirit of the Matrix and understanding fans' demands. I applaud them for giving us more of their world. And that may be the aim, for with this bridge (do not think of The Matrix Reloaded as a film that can stand alone), they have sufficiently whetted my appetite for the finalé. In some ways, while the first one could even be seen spiritually, the second reverses some of the ideas to generate doubt within the illusion of the Matrix  and the third may bring clarification.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, you can always get too much of a good thing, in this case, the fight scenes were repetitious and went much too long, most notably the fight scene with the Mr. Smiths. The movie could have been 15-30 minutes shorter (shorten the fight scenes and the ""mosh pit""), and the story would have been much tighter and it would have moved along at a better pace. As well, I was left wondering how Neo ever got back to the ship - did he just appear? Never once do we see him use the old fashioned telephone technique. One is left assuming that he has suddenly acquired/honed a number of wonderful new skills. Finally, I have a real peeve that the the movie was simply designed to introduce the final installment. I would much prefer to see a complete movie that can stand on its own. The Wachowski brothers sold out just to make a few more bucks (several hundred million, to be precise). I can only hope that the last two segments are reedited into one intact movie that truly holds up to the original.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first matrix was original (kind of, there were predecessors with similar ideas), it was ground breaking and revolutionary. I think it is pretty safe to say it was iconic. It had an open ending, and I think it should have remained that way.I might be wrong, but the sequels don't feel like they were counted on from the start. It is a different feeling when you plan to make a trilogy or you make one successful movie and stick two follow-ups onto it. This feels as the later, and the sequels are diminishing in returns. While the plot of the first movie is in essence pretty understandable with nerdy programmer stuff sprinkled in there for us geeks, the sequels double down on the geeky stuff and action.The plot of the sequel is about saving Zion from an immediate threat of a robot army. It is highly advisable to watch the Final Flight of Osiris from The Animatrix, to better keep up with the characters, though it is not essential or necessary. The plotline inside the Matrix is basically a fetchquest with the goal to somehow save Zion as well, and there is a Smith Situation on top of that.No-one will fault you if you can't quite keep up. I have seen the trilogy multiple times, am somewhat of a geek, an engineer familiar with programming (though not a programmer by trade) and I am not entirely sure that I understand it completely. The sequels dive really deep into philosophical waters at times with way too much expository dialogue that requires multiple rewatches to fully grasp. These parts are a determent to entertainment and do not stick with you as much as the messages of the first movie did. To balance this, there is the action which is excellent, though not really better than the first film. As a kid, I just used to watch the Burly Brawl and then the whole sequence since they get the Keymaker towards the end of the highway chase. You have some fighting with weapons, shootouts, highway chase including on a motorcycle. Very entertaining stuff.Let me get back to the object of interest of the sequels, it being Zion. Personally, I don't like it very much and for the small runtime it gets it should have been left for the third movie and better developed. It had the potential to be an another memorable Sci-Fi set piece but what do we get? Everybody wearing dirty rags, a council of diverse characters we learn nothing about and a cringy cave-rave. While the look and feel of the first movie was groundbreaking, the look and feel of the sequel is rather disappointing. Thanks to the entertaining action I rate it as an average sci-fi which is a shame considering what came before. In fact, I'm going to give the first movie full marks if I already haven't done so.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

No spoilers, but I will include some specifics here that may not agree with those whose sole joy of the theater rests in their being surprised. If you want to know nothing about this movie, stop reading now.
There, for the rest of you, this: The Wachowski Bros. have nailed it again. The story picks up some months after the conclusion of the first film. A new operator, Link, played by Harold Perrineau, has replaced Tank at the controls of the Nebuchadnezzar, Neo and Trinity are sleeping together, and good old Morpheus is still doing the serious leader stuff. If you don't know what I am talking about, and I seriously doubt that, then you haven't seen ""The Matrix"" yet. Trust me, rent or buy the DVD prior to seeing ""Reloaded"". It will help.It will also hurt - here's why:  Unlike the original with its stunning opening bit with Trinity in the hotel room, this movie starts slowly. The Wachowskis have a story to tell here, and it just takes a bit of time to get rolling. During perhaps the first 45 minutes of the show, I was beginning to think that ""Reloaded"" was stumbling into the same hole as the Star Wars movies. It was beginning to feel self-absorbed, ponderous, overly serious, and cautious. I am sorry if this comment hurts the feelings of the Star Wars fans, but that is how I see that whole thing going. The Matrix, on the other hand, is decidedly not tripping down that particular rabbit hole. Things do pick up, and when they do, hold on.There is much to tell about the film, but I want to call attention to one character you will meet: The Architect, played to the hilt of pomposity by Helmut Bakaitis. This guy personifies pedanticism. And if any of the words in this last sentence gave you a problem, just wait until you meet the architect. This guy is your worst freshman philosophy nightmare, straight from the pit of hell and Oxford, humorless as a cold razor across your palm. Some films are rated R for violence, some for sex -- and you will find a bit of the latter and a passel of the former in this film -- but you will not find another movie anywhere with a stream of vocabulary like this guy spouts. The film board should have a proviso added to the ratings system that includes `Rated R for Incomprehensibility, no one under 17 admitted without a thesaurus'. While the architect was onscreen, I couldn't help thinking, looking around the theater at all the teenagers. The thing is, the Wachowskis are peeling an onion here. Layer after layer it goes, and when you think you have gotten somewhere, another layer is discovered. The Architect reveals some startling information to Neo, but is it really true, or just another layer of the onion? What is reality? What does it all mean, Mr. Natural?My guess is, the kids will figure it out faster than me, and good for them. Good for you, too. Be sure to see this film if you liked the original, and don't get antsy during the first act, it gets real hot soon.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The same can be said for the matrix reloaded it was after the film that we all sat down and discussed what we had just saw and the more you think about it the better it gets. OK the rave thing in zion was far far to indulgent hopefully this whole sequence will be a chapter on the dvd so you can skip it and there was a woeful lack of kick ass music where it was needed (can you imagine morpheus walking down the street in the first matrix without clubbed to death in the background)but otherwise the film delivered. some say the fights are too long but they are amazing to watch so wheres the problem? some say there is too much 'talky bits' well wait for terminator 3 and you can have all the minimalist dialogue and random violence you want. of all the great tricks this film pulls off the best is one that most people won't see and is the cleverest thing the brothers have done - make a work of art that makes money.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Morpheus tells Neo that humanity is enslaved in order to harness human's bio-electricity to run the machines. He points out that their source of food is the liquified remains of others from the Matrix. The Matrix is therefore a giant perpetual-motion machine - which is, of course, impossible.Morpheus does add in a throwaway line that the machines use fusion as well for their energy needs - my thinking is that this would be their main energy source.Anyway, if a Matrix really was needed, why not use a creature less troublesome than humans? Surely sheep and cows produce bio-electricity too.Regardless of that small issue, I  suspended my disbelief and sat back and enjoyed the movie. I venture to say I'll enjoy the second and third installments too.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The novelty has already gone while the main strength of the original, despite groundbreaking fx, was it's great story. That story has now already been told. Mr Anderson turning into Neo, The One, becoming his true self and finding out the stunning truth.So, what is left after this? More action. Lots more. Surely, more spectacular and over-the-top, but more is not always more. The movie fails in introducing interesting new characters and the dialogue is extremely dull, lacking the humour and spunk of the first movie. We're supposed to believe Neo and Trinity (and I still don't get why she is called that) truly love each other with a sex scene? I'll prefer the Han Solo-Princess Leia romance anytime. And where are the little comic reliefs like the Mouse character in the first movie? Furthermore, where is the suspense? Do we really fear for Neo's life now that he has found out about his superpower, taking on 100's of Agent Smith clones and flying around like superman? I'll prefer an unprepared Luke Skywalker challenging Vader in ""Empire"" anytime. It was like the Wachovsky Brothers took out everything likeable about Anime (character develeopment, little distincion between good and evil, insecureties and weaknesses of the hero) and substituted it for bland American comicbook Superheroism.The plot can be summarized as the following: sentinels heading towards Zion plus Neo having to find Keymaker that is needed for access to the Matrix Mainframe. This, between the boring dialogue (except perhaps for the dialogue in the ending with the maker and the chitchat with that French dude), is filled up with an extended version of the trailer. Yup, that's it. The trailer already showed small parts of all the action scenes, leaving no surprising action scenes. All in all, a disappointment. What went wrong in a production that was so obviously dedicated (making us wait 4 years) in creating a superior sequel. The only comfort I can take in it is that they probably wanted to save the best for last.So, all we have is action? Are they any good? Certainly. The Attack of the Smith Clones should become legendary and is unseen in film history. The car chase is extremely complex and long. Furthermore, more kungfu than guns which is a good thing. My only problem was that Laurence Fishburnes moves looked a bit slow.One more thing: that whole techno/tribal dance thing in Zion, after Morpheus speech, it was rather ridiculous. Don't get me wrong I like techno, but it just seemed out of place.So, sequels still suck, most of the time....bummer! 6 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The hype was real and the clout the Wachowski's garnered from the first film in the series can't be denied, but having watched Releoaded at least a dozen times since my youth, I can honestly say neither the visuals nor the dialogue hold up very well. The first film is timeless, whereas Reloaded now, it seems, was untimely. The CG just wasn't quite there yet, and mixing it with practical effects just turns what was a cheap wine into vinegar.This movie is not without merit. The dialogue, while somewhat incoherent and obtuse at times, can be engaging when it's not completely expository. The practical action sequences are proficient, and the highway chase, with its mix of practical and CG, works well. That said, seeing Neo fight hand-to-hand with faceless minion with sword #5 can become laborious, when seemingly nothing is at stake.Neo and Trinity have about as much chemistry as a Betty Crocker oven from the late 80's, while the erotic scenes have about as much taste as a cake from said oven. There's something missing, and leaving these scenes out would have done wonders for expediting the story.The first film in the trilogy should and could have been left as a stand alone, but once Hollywood smells money, taste can and usually does go out the window. The ""have your thesaurus ready"" dialogue attempts to be exclusive, while in actuality it alienates not only the most interested and seasoned vocabularies, but also those for whom one ergo is too much.Decent sequel, decent movie, but falls short in spite of a larger budget and more lofty special effects.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's technically clever and inventive. As a sequel to ""The Matrix,"" however, it falls quite short. The first ""Matrix"" dazzled audiences with its special FX, to be sure. But more than that, I believe it conveyed a model of human breakthrough that inspired people consciously, and on unconscious levels. Whatever it was, SOMETHING about the first ""Matrix"" movie captured people's imaginations on a level much deeper and more profound that mere special effects wizardry.""Matrix Reloaded"" was very obviously under tremendous pressure to duplicate and advance that earlier success--- both in the technical crafting of the film, and the transcendental vibe that sparked out from the first movie. This ""Matrix Reloaded"" script strains to be ""heavy,"" and strains to over-load with fluffy philosophy, profundity, and meaning. It tries desperately, and that vain, panting effort in the script is evident. It tries too hard. To quote the recent movie ""Super Troopers,"" ""Desperation is a stinky cologne.""Funny thing--- if there was no ""The Matrix,"" this flick would probably be a 9 or 10. But because it is a sequel, comparisons are invited, in fact, comparisons are demanded--- and ""The Matrix Reloaded"" falls way short.

Even if the film has 'let down' many of the ardent fans, it has certainly provoked widespread debating with regard to the plot and given many people something to chew on until November 5th. I find this to be almost as important as the film. Whilst not succeeding on certain levels, the second installment is incredibly enjoyable and engaging throughout. This has led to many late night discussions on what will happen next. Call me a geek, but I find the storyline far exceeds what is demanded of an action film. Secondly, at least the Wachowskis are making ambitious films. It has led to debate and arguments. The special effects were irrefutably fantastic. Point out the few moments of cgi imperfection if you like, but the film dares to stretch the boundaries and I like it for these reasons.The main problem of the film was the hype. I honestly believe that the hardcore followers thought it would cure cancer. One must remember that it is only a film, and a sequel at that. Where the first film arrived like a silent assassin and took the world by surprise, we could see this one coming from 500 yards away. As a result, the level of expectation was ultimately going to be damaging. The Wachowskis had action fans, philosophers and the the public to please at the same time. They succeeded by not folding under the wealth of pressure. Nonetheless, the amount of vitriolic posts on websites bewilders me. This is NOT a bad film by any stretch of the imagination. It is simply not as good as the first film, which was perfect in its pre-millenium timing and slick execution. Having read many reviews from respected newspapers and magazines, they all found Reloaded to be a reasonably solid film. This is because they didn't expect the film to change their world. I have seen the film twice now, and found it notably better on second viewing. Take away the expectation and I found it to improve instantly. I am sure that if the Matrix was under such close scrutiny then Reeves would have been mocked as would have some of the throwaway characters ie Switch, Apoc etc.I am not a blind defender of the film, and do acknowledge its flaws. Some of the dialogue is trite and some of the action gratuitous. Neo's superhuman status also damages the characterisation - he is no longer vulnerable and I was rarely afraid for him. Where we once felt tense as he went into battle, I knew the outcome. However, the third film is undoubtedly darker and sees Neo (from the trailer) in trouble. Whilst there is clearly more of a 'popcorn' feel to elements of the film, it never pretends to be anything else than ambitious and plot-driven. The second film always has the dilemma of building on the first whilst leaving enough for the third. One must also remember that the whole story is not yet complete. The ignorant groans that accompanied each end of the LOTR films (which are undeniably great) are a testament to a public with little patience. ""Wait and ye shall see"", and personally I look forward to the third film with great anticipation.
I dont intend to analyse in detail what was great about the film, because much of it is the same reasons why I liked the first film. The storyline,the principal characters, the dark undertones, the combat, the guns, cars, bikes, and the undeniable style to name but a few. There is much to like about the Matrix Reloaded, and a few niggles. Writing out a few lines and making some of the fighting more relevant would have made it that little bit better. Despite this, I still hugely enjoyed the film and for those who are still dismayed by its lack of perfection, please drop your impossible expectations. The film is just plain old good, not perfect.

If you haven't, you're going to be lost. There's a lot in here that depends on the plot of the original. So please, go see the original before seeing this sequel.The Matrix itself is basically everything you see - the entire planet, the movie says, is controlled by machines. Only a select few know this, and their mission in life is to free the minds of others who are enslaved by the Matrix, leading them to the city of Zion, located about the Earth's core.One of the chief rebels is Morpheus, played by Lawrence Fishburne. Morpheus, in the original movie, thinks he's stumbled upon The One, the person who can save Zion and the rest of humanity from the Matrix. That would be Neo, played by Keanu Reeves.As the second movie opens, the machines have discovered Zion and are tunneling to it. It's only a matter of time before they tunnel through and kill all those inside. But rather than fortify the defenses of the city, Morpheus believes in the prophecy of The One. He defies the orders of the city's elders and brings Neo back to the surface (that is, the Matrix) so that he can meet with the wise Oracle.Are you confused yet? There are many themes here, some of which are philosophical and metaphysical in nature. One can view this movie on two fronts: as a gritty action movie or as a thought-provoking drama.Reloaded is replete with some eye-opening special effects, many of which were computer generated. In one scene, Neo combats the evil Agent Smith. Oh, but not just one Agent Smith - 100 of them at once. It's not like those cheesy kung fu movies where the villains take turns beating up on Bruce Lee; in this one, they attack simultaneously. Another scene features a fight atop a tractor-trailer on a crowded freeway.It's tough to convey all of the complexities of the plot. In fact, this is a movie that people - like the original - will need to watch multiple times just to catch all of the plot twists. What does it all mean? And even more important, what's it all leading to? This is the second movie of the series, with the third one coming out in November this year.Rather than delve into the intricacies of the storyline, let me give you some pros and cons. If you're a fan of the series, you're going to go no matter what I say, and if you thought the first one was a waste or not for you anyway, you won't be going to this one.Let's look at the acting. It's wooden. Keanu Reeves was born to play this role, as it requires little to no emoting. Plus, he looks cool in shades and a trenchcoat. I'll admit it, he looks very good, and in the non-computer-generated fight scenes, he looks somewhat plausible.
His love interest, the mysterious Trinity, is played by Carrie-Anne Moss. Another one who simply cannot act, so she fits right in. Now, this may be a simple matter of personal tastes, but she's astoundingly unattractive. She's Neo's love interest, and yet the two of them have absolutely no chemistry. It's like watching a totem pole and a mop mate. Eew.Even Fishburne didn't come off perfectly. Some of his lines sound like they came off a cereal box top. Sure, that's no fault of Larry, but his delivery had the resonance of a funeral dirge. He's a very commanding figure, though, and he does deliver a solid performance as Morpheus.Okay, so maybe the acting isn't wonderful. Who cares, right? You don't watch these movies for the emoting. Let's see some tail being kicked!The action sequences are very good, although not quite as overwhelming as those in the original. There are some additions - Agent Smith can replicate, and Neo can now fly. The flying thing is key, but quite frankly he just looks like Superman with a different color cape. Even so, the sequences themselves are good. The problem is that sometimes they seemed to be thrown into the movie for no real reason other than to have an action scene. Another problem is that these scenes seemed to come right from a Nintendo game. You know, the type where you hit something like up and right and the B button to do a freaky Street Fighter move on someone? Plus several times in each scene, the action is paused so that the audience can get the full effect, since everyone's moving so quickly.Another big difference between this movie and the original is that although the original was pretty philosophical itself, it expressed philosophical themes with tangible objects, such as the pills and the spoon. You see? We normal folk can grasp those concepts when the themes are expressed in that manner. But the second film relies more on abstract concepts, and that might lose people who don't have doctorates in Jungian theories.The ending is a little bit of a downer, but since we know it's leading up to the third film, we shouldn't feel particularly let down. Yes, it's ""to be continued,"" but this movie more than stands on its own. Think of it more as an episode.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Who wants to see Neo(who starts looking like Abe from Abe's Odyssey whenever the CG kicks in) basically dance around the screen for 10 minutes at a time?  He doesn't really need anyone else there, because he doesn't really get hurt throughout the entire movie.  The Agent Smith fight....wow...where'd the $100 million go?

For some strange reason, it gave me a lord of the rings, meets terminator, meets jackie chan type feeling. (I know that's difficult to comprehend) On the note of comparing it to other movies, there is a scene in the movie that they stole straight from minority report. The movie ends too abruptly for me. Where as other recent triligies/sequels have some sort of closure at the end of each film, reloaded just sort of stops. People in the movie give long complicated speeches and some things are difficult to follow. In the phantom menace, darth maul didn't receive enough screen time, nor did lady deathstrike in X2, and once again the two cool lookig bad guys in reloaded are robbed of screen time and dialog. Someone please tell me why roy jones jr is in this movie, playing a CAPTAIN of a ship at that. In closing, the matrix reloaded IS an entertaining flick and well worth seeing. Get there early AND stay late in order to catch ALL of the trailers. Stay cool!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

To give you some perspective, I loved ""The Matrix"". I saw it three times in the theater and I own the DVD. I loved ""The Matrix"" because  1. It allowed a certain ambiguity. 2. It didn't spoon-feed the audience 3. It didn't take itself too seriously.""The Matrix Reloaded"" comes across as a typical Hollywood sequel: Repeat/Augment the successful scenes of the first film, Add some interesting characters and blow the whole thing with exposition and convolution. I expected more from the Wachowski Brothers.I will be the first to admit there were some incredible visual sequences. Some fights and chases were executed in fine form, but I found myself thinking during some of the extended martial arts scenes: ""Why am I watching Keanu Reeves in a wire harness in ""bullet-time"" when I can watch a true artist like Bruce Lee in my copy of ""Enter the Dragon""? In light of the true nature of 'the matrix' all the fist-fighting and gunplay seems superfluous and ultimately filler until the next expositional moment in the script. In other words, sure there were some cracker-jack action scenes, but they didn't advance the plot a whole lot. A great action film usually requires a lot of suspension of disbelief on the part of the audience, but at some point the whole ""jacking into and out of the matrix gimmick"" requires a new level of suspension of disbelief. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is an example of  another film with many cracker-jack action scenes but the difference is the scenes actually advanced the plot.
Speaking of exposition, I kept waiting for Micheal York from the ""Austin Powers"" movies to show up. I mean, COME ON! Somebody tell the screenwriters that the high-school level philosophy class isn't impressing anyone over the age of 18. The first film did a much better job of avoiding making the audience feel like they should take  dictation without coming across as shallow. This film does precisely the opposite by talking itself in circles and in the end appearing vacuous.Also another suggestion to the filmakers: keep the power level of Neo consistent. In one scene he can disrupt the entire matrix with his ""wake"" and in another five dudes with less skill that Agent Smith keep him occupied for far too long. Either he is omnipotent or he is not. If he is omnipotent within the matrix you don't have much of a story. The Wachowski's seem to want to have it both ways.OK, I admit I'll shell out the $10.00 to see the next one and ultimately that determines the financial success of a movie, but box-office receipts do not determine whether a film reaches it's potential as a classic series as ""The Matrix"" could have.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

They went on waaaay toolong, but the producers knew that they were the only thing peoplewould take away from the movie, so they put in a lot of them.Most of the other special effects are okay (notably the ships) butthere's nothing really clever about any of them, and they go out oftheir way to avoid any really impressive, world-building, effects. For example, the way the transitions between the doors is handledis awkward and doesn't add to the world.  Zion is okay, in a Mobiussort of way, but the curves and lack of right angles doesn't reallycontrast with the Matrix... because you never see the Matrix.  Thecomic relief works, mostly.The plot doesn't hold together as yet, but this is the middle of atrilogy, remember?  The acting is horrible.  I mean, really really badfor too many of the secondary characters.  Keanu, Fishburne andco. do okay, but not really better than that.  There are a couple ofexceptions:  Mergovingian and Persephone not only have the bestnames (which will tell you what happens to them, if you'refollowing the theme) but make their characters believable.  TheKeymaker overcomes an inconsistently written role.  But mostly it'sHelmut Bakaitis as the Architect.  I could have sworn that was KenNordine.  He was great.  The only really good bit of acting in thewhole picture, and it comes near the end to save the day.By himself, Bakaitis raises Matrix Reloaded at least one star, andmaybe two.Ah well.  Maybe I'll change my mind when I see all three episodestogether, but I didn't think this was such a great movie.  Loads ofpulse-pounding action, pseudo-philosophy and the occasionalgood line of dialog, but I don't feel particularly excited about seeingthe third one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Also, in some parts they just seem to stretch things too far.Nonetheless, great movie, full of action, and good dialogue.

On its own, it is a great action movie, one that anyone loving that style would appreciate above average level. But reality does matter in this world, and Matrix has created such a cult and expectations, that one cannot watch this movie and say ""that was exactly the sequel I had expected"".
Half the fights are pointless, given the context and the characters involved, the key information is given well after a ton of useless context-building information, between two ""damn-already-5-minutes-passed-quick-let's-Kung-Fu-around-because-we've-got- film-to-use"" fights: the meeeting with the Merovingian, the Architect or the Oracle are important moments where someone talks too much diluting the key information. There's a strong feeling that the non-action scenes were inserted to explain the plot (again) to some retarded pea-brained teenager, the other half inserted to please some hip-producer-whisperer gurus: the dance scene, the love scene, Morpheus vs. Lock, the kid Neo saved in the Animatrix's episode ""Kid's story"", Monica Bellucci's completely pointless role, and others. On top of that, given the thin scenario, another disappointment is the absence of surprise in special effects. These and the plot where the great innovations of Matrix. The Matrix: Reloaded does not have these. It becomes, at best, a very good action-Kung-Fu-sci-Fi movie attempting at being credible. I have felt the same impression when, after seeing the great ""Alien"" (low-budget, innovating directions and a solid scenario), I had to be disappointed by Aliens (too much budget, no surprise and a transparent scenario). Even if ""Revolutions"" will develop a new dimension revealed at the end of ""Reloaded"", I feel like I've been sold ""The Matrix 1.5, new super-plus formula with more hormones, **LIGHT** (no calories, no soul). Too much teasing. I really start to wonder if a sequel was necessary, given the great innovation brought by the very good Comics and Animatrix series organised around the Matrix theme. Again, a great action movie. Nothing new. Don't expect too much or the disappointment will hit you hard. And be patient: stay until the end of the titles, it's worth waiting the extra minutes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Much has happened in the world since then- the election debacle of 2000, the dot-com collapse and of course, 9/11. Given recent world events, it's tough to greet the release of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" without feeling a sense of nostalgia for the bygone era that produced it's predecessor. The first film, a mixture of the cyberpunk literary genre, superhero fantasy, kung-fu and John Woo-style gunplay, with a touch of Zen philosophy thrown in for good measure, arrived on the scene with little hype or fanfare. The movie was quickly embraced as a modern classic, a superb synthesis of popular cinematic styles that staked out new territory with its visual effects, especially the now-famous ""bullet-time"" concept that has subsequently been parodied or imitated in too many films to count. ""The Matrix"" won four Academy awards, including a well-deserved victory in the visual effects category.""The Matrix Reloaded"" is, in many ways, a far more ambitious picture. There is much to enjoy here, from the introduction of numerous new characters, to a more complex plot, to the last screen performance of actress Gloria Foster (The Oracle), and of course, fabulous visuals and action scenes. There is a scene involving a slice of chocolate cake that I found to be brilliant and very rich. The end result is a movie that is as thought-provoking as the original. A philosophical action movie for those who want a roundhouse kick to go with their koans.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

After a while you realised that the scenes werent coming up with anything new. Very dull.The story was missing the mystery that made the first film a success. It seemed to go on for ages and ended 10 mins from the finish, or so it seemed.The motorway chases were okay but not groundbreaking. A little too much CGI possibly.In summary, the story was very slow and unoriginal. They were trying just too damn hard this time I think. If you like the ""XXX"" kind of film then this is for you. Lots of shooting and fighting etc... If you like the sort of film that discovers a new way to present a film (The Matrix) then this one is not for you and you should wait for the DVD.Dont get me wrong, it aint that bad, but it aint wot I went to the cinema to see.

I was right about the former, entirely wrong about the latter, and I'm almost disappointed that I went to see it.The sequel premise is rather straightforward. Approximately one year after the original film, Neo's powers have grown to the point where he is literally a living god within the Matrix. He is married to Trinity and is gathering a huge following as the ""savior"" of the last human city of Zion. The Osiris, a ship patrolling the upper levels, detects the presence of a massive machine army coming to destroy Zion. The commanders and ship captains begin bulking up defenses, but Morpheus, with his messianic vision, believes that the key to defeating the machines lies with Neo. The crew of the Nebuchadnezzar takes upon themselves a mission to fulfill the prophecies of the Oracle and save Zion.While in plot the film is quite good, the acting was atrocious at times and unworthy of some of the actors. Keanu Reeves could have been literally replaced by a stunt double and he would probably have done better acting on screen. In an attempt to somehow become more ""deep"" and ""philosophical"", the Wachowski brothers tried to pepper the film with awkward dialogue and pseudo-mysticism. While that material is not necessarily bad or wrong, it could have been delivered more effectively.The action was good but some of the CGI was absolutely horrible, while some of it was fantastic on the other hand. I found that the scene where Neo fights 100 different Agent Smiths was the poorest of the scenes involving CGI, as it seemed a little *too* artificial. It annoys me to no end that fans try to pass this off as the ""artificiality of the Matrix"" and the ""deep inherent message"" when it really comes down to the ineptitude with which the scene was edited, due to time constraints.Worth seeing for a first shot but really not memorable.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is definitely a lot of fun and the action sequences are absolutely thrilling. I especially loved the car chase, which reached its climax in the mind-blowing truck crash. That was and extreme moment and I remember hold my breath for a while there. Outstanding special effects all through, however I think the ""Neo beats the crap out of 100 Agent Smiths""-scene goes on far too long. It seems as if Larry and Andy have let themselves get carried away with their capabilities, and they don't know when to stop. The rave/love scene was absolutely beautiful and visually it matched the rest of the film perfectly.Some passages in the movie are edited together a bit confusing and therefore it can be hard to keep up. The scene with the Architect went very fast, and he sure did used a lot of strange words. For me it became necessary to read the subtitles (which usually doesn't happen), and they went by extremely fast. Hopefully I'll get all the details watching it a second time. The ""ending"" was horrible and not very elegant. Naturally it had to end with a cliffhanger, but still some kind of an ending would have been appropriate. I would still go and watch the final chapter of the trilogy without the ""To be concluded"" at the end. All in all I'd give Reloaded 8 out of 10. The first film was definitely a 10, but Reloaded has been ""reduced"" to a great action movie.
However, I can't wait to see Revolutions, hopefully it'll be worth the wait.

The trick to this movie was to surpass the fx levels of the previous movie.  Since they'd already done bullet-time (and believe me, they still do), they had to go one step further.  Sadly, this step was CG. Really, the most notable part is the sequence in the movie known as the ""burly brawl."" This scene has Neo fighting off dozens of Agent Smiths.  The whole scene, save for some close face shots, was done with CG.  The goal here, to surpass the fx of the previous film, was to make the CG as seamless as possible.  And here, they fail.  Now maybe I'm just nit picking here, but man...again with the expectations.Aside from the ""burly brawl,"" there are still a few other flaws.  The first half hour or so of the movie isn't overly eventful.  There's this rave'esque scene in the caves of Zion that takes place while Neo and Trinity are getting their ""groove"" on, which seems rather pointless.  And honestly, not only could they have gone without it, but it might have brought the MPAA rating down to PG-13 had they gone done so.  Lawrence Fishburne's acting seemed a little canned at times; especially when delivering the speech that takes place right before the crazy Zion dance.That's it though; those are really the only major flaws.  The rest of the movie is amazing, if not thoroughly stunning at times.  The second half of the movie makes up significantly for the flaws in the first half.  The storyline starts to get rather deep, and you need to be thinking in order to grasp everything (definitely a repeat watcher).  And as you may have ready by now, this movie is really only half of a movie. The movie gets are far as it needs to go and literally ends with the words ""To be concluded"" on the screen.  Thankfully, we only have to wait six months for the conclusion. I urge everyone to stick it out through the credits at the end of the film, as there is a short but worth it teaser for Matrix Revolution at the end.Having spent time to thinking about and writing this, I wish I could go back and give it an eight or a nine.  Maybe I was dwelling on the flaws too much when I only gave it a seven.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I liked the first film, so don't think I'm a hater of the series or anything, but what narks me off about sci-fi sequels in general, is that instead of leaving aspects to the film to your imagination, the film's reality is shoved down your throat. Places and scenes that would have been better left out (EG Morpheus' speech in zion) are done, and they just come off as being there for the sake of it. Big words are used for the sake of making the film sound smarter than it actually is, proved when neo later condenses reams of someone's philosophical garbage into a single sentence.This film's very different to the last, which some might like, but others such of myself find off-putting. The first was alot more inventive and had an infinitly more interesting storyline. For number two, expect more of the same, but overkilled bullet-time, over-complicated plot, over-extravagant effects.Although with all this said, there are some brilliant fight scenes, and the car chase scene is filmed nicely, but these few gleams of brilliance don't make up for the pretension that is the rest of the film.I understood it, just didn't like it. It takes more than this film's glossy exterior to fool me into thinking the film's as polished underneath as it is on the surface.Nice try.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In fifty years, people will look back at this film and say that it was the first movie of the 21st century. By now, it's so big that it has stopped being a mere science-fiction flick, and has become a cultural phenomenon rapidly growing into a subculture on its own. Combining some of the artistically most interesting aspects of pop culture - Philip K. Dicks science fiction, John Woos blood opera, the unique visual style of Animes such as Ghost in the Shell, and William Gibsons cyberpunk aesthetics, to name a few - into a breathtaking two hour ride, it can be safely said that it influenced whomever saw it, as the massive amount of 'matrixesque' action flicks that came out since then shows.And now, Matrix 2 has been released.Wrong. Matrix: Reloaded has been released.I've heard many dissapointed voices stating that the movie is ""too shallow"", ""too deep"", ""too unspectacular"", ""a pure FX flick"", and so on. Many of these complaints stem from our usual attitude towards sequels: When a second part of a movie is announced, we expect the same film with a stronger budget and a weaker plot. Reloaded doesn't fit this scheme.What made Matrix so great? In one phrase, I'd say it was its sleek looks, its cool action, its twisty plot, and its mind-boggling environment - the Matrix itself.Comparing the two movies, we quickly realize that, while we still have plenty of 'cool' scenes, a big part of the movies aesthetics concentrate on the more 'gritty' feeling of the real world, as we saw it on board of Morpheus' ship in part one. There is still lots of action, but instead of gun ballets, the emphasis is shifted towards hand-to-hand combat. The plot, while still full of surprises, does not focus so much on a single person discovering the true nature of the world he lives in, but instead rises to a 'bigger' scale. Trying not to spoil anything, I'll say that the environment of this plot isn't comparable to part one. There, the Matrix was still the main characters 'home', which he gradually left, now, it's a place he visits sometimes, a backdrop for his further actions.Thus, Reloaded is, while still in the frame of the franchise, not directly comparable to Matrix, part one. Don't try, or you'll inevitably be dissapointed, because some aspect you held dearly have doubtlessly been moved out of the spotlight.All this does however not tell you how good or bad the movie Matrix: Reloaded is.Well, the dialogue is average at best and wooden at average. The special effects are, while very well executed, just not as breathtaking as those in part one. For once, the old lie seems to hold true: It's not how much you have, it's what you do with it. Also, there is no complete 'wow' moment such as the legendary lobby scene in part one.The plots scope, which tries to encompass what can only be described as two separate worlds, is getting blurry from time to time, leaving the audience either puzzled or losing its connection to the actors, which raises another point: The acting. Excluding the brilliant Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving, the cast consists of average actors. They just don't manage to make you truly, *truly* believe they are who they claim to be.Yet, Reloaded is an awesome movie.As with Matrix, one has to realize that Reloaded doesn't only rely on actors or dialogue to transport the plot, but also and primarily on its pictures. Every scene, every carefully picked camera angle, is filled to the brim with metaphors and symbols; nothing that would not help to emphasize the main motives of the movie. This is what makes Reloaded a piece of art: The sheer richness of its metaphorical vocabulary and the virtuosity with which the Wachowskis use every device, as weak as it may seem individually, at their disposal to further it into a truly incredible variety. This variety is however also what makes the film difficult and at times confusing, especially since it ends with a true cliffhanger, not solving the questions it poses - at least until fall.All in all, I can understand why people dislike Matrix: Reloaded, yet, one has to admit it being a good movie. I prefer the first part because of its more stringent plot, but will definetly watch Reloaded again. And again. And again.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, as you probably know this one wasn't as popular or as great as the first film. The main reason for this as far as I can see is simple -- at the beginning of the film there is a half hour or so segment set in Zion which completely sucks the life out of everyone, and most of them can never truly be recovered after that. The later, tedious dialogue sequences that go around and around in circles don't help much either.Don't get me wrong, the action sequences are all great, the multi-Smith battle, the lengthy car chase and road battle sequence are all fantastic pieces of cinema history, and for this reason alone ""The Matrix Reloaded is not to be missed. As a general rule, any scene in this film that is set inside the Matrix is great and worth seeing, and at the end there are not one but (eek!) TWO twists that, while they might not make a whole lot of sense, will make your head spin and definitely make you want to watch ""The Matrix Revolutions"" if you haven't already.Now, onto that pesky first half hour ... the reason that this segment is there is to establish plot, develop characters and it is mostly reliant on dialogue. As you'll remember from the first film, plot and dialogue aren't exactly the Wachowski brother's strong point. They proceed to poke so many more holes in the Matrix arc-plot that you may as well just skip over this opening segment -- it won't make sense anyway. The new characters also fail to be as interesting or appealing as the character's who we know and love in the first film, and I find that I wouldn't care that much if they all ended up dead in the next one. As for the dialogue, there are certain lines that almost made me cringe and clench my seat in agony. George Lucas had a similar problem with his latest Star Wars efforts ... it's a case of great special effects combined with inadequate scriptwriting.On the whole this an entertaining film and worth seeing for certain segments, but by no means is it a classic like it's prequel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Well these brothers set out to do just that and accomplished it above and beyond any expectations I had with THE MATRIX RELOADED.Not only is it a technically superior film, with visual effects to make George Lucas envious, but the story and philosophy behind the Matrix is expanded as well. We are introduced to new characters, new concepts and new revelations about the Matrix, its origins and its functions.Seeing the first film is a must because all of the main characters have been so well established in THE MATRIX that this sequel is focused simply on expanding those characters. Without prior knowledge from the first film you will undoubtedly become lost in the maze of philosophical and thematic outpourings offered up in this film.The final verdict? THE MATRIX RELOADED is the must-see film this year and will have your heart thumping all throughout the incredible kung-fu action sequences, the breathtaking visual effects scenes and the shocking revelations about the Oracle, Zion and the Matrix itself.Now the only question remaining is: they topped THE MATRIX, but can they top THE MATRIX RELOADED? We'll find out in November.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The only down points of the movie is the giant party at Zion, it went to long and diverted to far out of the story line, it did have a point to lead to the love scene with Trinity and Neo, but the length of the scene is very distracting. But the incredible action scenes make up for this.But in the end a matrix is a must for any in who wants to see some grate action or a grate story.PS: wait till the credits is over and see the trailer for `The Matrix: Revolution'","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Even though I had just watched the original movie earlier this week, I felt lost and unconnected to the story.  Suddenly Trinity and Neo have a deep love and will die for one another.  And we find out more about new characters through short excerpts into the lives of the people living in Zion. This is intended to make the story more emotionally connected, yet seems false because the two lovers barely have a conversation.  The movie is not all bad though, the special effects are quite amazing.  There are double the action sequences in this reloaded version than in the original.  The Wachowski brothers thought that amazing the audience with their computer graphics would be the way to go, however, without a strong story to back them up, the action almost gets boring.  With no real ending but a TO BE CONCLUDED at the end of the movie, the Matrix Reloaded is frustrating, and lacks the originality of the first Matrix movie.  I think this will disappoint, but I do recommend seeing it, perhaps when it comes out on video. 6/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Lol, just kidding.  Anyway... Because I didn't see the first one in the theatres I didn't see the second one, don't want to ruin my streak.  I had expectations that were high when it was originally released, then after reading bad reviews, but expectations went down a little.  I have now seen the movie and I am here to say that it is probably the best action movies I have ever seen... And this didn't surprise me.The movie is NOT as good as the original, but surprise, right?  However, the action in this movie is so mind blowing Revolutions better have some kick ass story elements, or it will not be as good as this one.  This is the Matrix in the coolest form... No long boring talks about faith and stuff like that, just pure action.  The first one was needed to set up the story; the second is here to progress the story to the end, which is where Revolutions will come in... That is the only reason this movie exists, to progress the story and anyone who doesn't see this must not have see and of the Star Wars movies.The story is here in this movie that's for sure. However, it is absolutely necessary to see the movies as a trilogy, not independent films So a movie like Reloaded is DEPENDENT on the viewer seeing and liking the first one and at least seeing the last one. But unlike the first one, it is there only to break up the action, just like the action was there in the first one to break up the story.  The visual effects in this movie are phenomenal... You'll see what I'm talking about when the trucks crash.If you really liked the first movie and consider yourself a ""fan"" of it, then you will appreciate this one... If not, your opinion is effected by something other than the movie... Perhaps peer-pressure or you constant need to be the special one who can never go with the group.  Either way your complete abandonment of this movie is sad and really puts you in a hole because someone who holds and opinion like that can never become a respected movie reviewer.In closing: If you liked the first one (I mean really liked it.) then you'd better like this one for what it is and not what you thought, expected, or should be.""The Matrix"": 10 ""The Matrix: Reloaded"": 8 ""The Matrix: Revolutions"": [Pending]","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With these kind of critics the producers could have slapped a Matrix label on a box of dog crap and still gotten glowing reviews. I am a huge Matrix fan and have seen the movie 3 times in the theatre and countless times after.  So here is a legitimate review. Aside from the fight seen, the first 45 minutes is a waste of budget money and film.  Anyone who says it contributed to the plot and enjoyment of the movie is lying, or hasn't seen it yet. I knew that this film would have much deeper pockets than the first one, which may have contributed to its thin plot and meaningless action.  The movie is packed with explosions, high budget car chases,  and wall to wall wire fighting and C.G.I. effects.  But it seriously lacks in the original story and attention to detail of the first.  In one particular fight scene where Neo was taking on multiples of the same agent, my girlfriend turned to me and said ""This doesn't look real, it looks like a video game.""  I thought that perhaps it was just my over-critical eye for C.G.I. detail, but coming from a girl who's movie genre is romantic comedy . . . I was shocked. Since it seems like the entire basis of the movie is the action; to her the effects should have appeared flawless. You know you're going to see Reloaded eventually, but do yourself a favor and don't wait in any lineups.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This story of two parallel worlds (with ubiquitous characters present sometimes in them both at same time) is told in a confusing and incoherent way (even taking for granted the fanciful movie script itself) which is aggravated by some speeches of cheap philosophy like those uttered by such characters as Merovingian or The Architect the latter near the end of the movie.

I like the matrix and i liked this movie. they were just so different. The thing that ruined the perfection of this film is zion. i was thinking it would be more of a dark england ruins type town but instead it was nearly just a rip off of something you'd see in star wars.

It seems the Wachowskis may have given Reloaded just a little bit too much hype, because, honestly, this movie did not live up to my expectations, or the hype. Now, I'm not going to deny that the movie is worth seeing for the special fx alone. They are spectacular. There's no two ways about it. The car chase is quite possibly the best I've ever seen in a film. The 100 agent smiths fight was also spectacularly done. Let's not forget the rest of the gunfights etc. Bottom line, the special FX rocked the house, but the story left a lot to be desired...But, with any luck, this will be remedied once Revolutions has been released, and the story will make a bit more sense after that.Also, I'm aware that Reloaded and Revolutions are in fact one movie, but as a movie by itself, Reloaded leaves a lot to be desired.

The Matrix is a monumental film in terms of action, story and style. Reloaded has action and style; the story is a bit less mythical... In the first I was charmed and intrigued by the Oracle and the forthcoming prophecy which all had a mystical and unexplained sense. You could make up your own story behind it. Logically, in Reloaded and Revolutions these stories are told and explained and makes the movie more straight forward. The dreams Neo has, are good for building the tension, but they don't have the quality or tension that David Lynch can give forecasting dreams and visions. Only the ending of Reloaded gives me back that sense of mystery. For a sequel, it's as good as it gets. I've seen many sequels of different movies, and only a few come close to this one. I truly enjoyed Reloaded, it's a rollercoaster ride and makes me impatient for November. Meanwhile I'll go to the theater again for the same great ride!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As an avid fan of the first film i felt it nessesary to see this film.As a film on it's own it is fantastic but, as everyone will no doubt do, it is only average compared to the first film.The fact that the original had already set up the story line there was never going to be a plot good or compelling enough to equal the first film's grand nature. That said the actions scene in this lesser sequal are far more impressive than anything the first film had to offer (although it is blatantly obvious when the SFX take over from the amazing wire work).The only downside i feel with this film is that it takes far too long to get going. The major fight between Neo and hundreds of Agent Smiths doesn't take place until an hour into the film. before this point there is a god awful rave scene in which scantally clad rebels delve into dirty dancing territory and a confusing if not mind boggling chat with the oracle (can't explain, too tedious and time consuming). But after putting yourself through the cumbersome exposition you get some the greatest fights in film history. including one of the best car chases i have ever scene (next to Bullet and Ronin).But again after the midle hour the film starts to lack again in what appears to be the anticlimax of the year. And then were are treated to Neo's chat with the Architect (which sounds like the actor has swallowed a thesaurus, SPEAK ENGLISH).But what i have come to realise is that this movie and The Matrix Relolutions can be classed as one film and i believe that splitting it into two sittings was the best way forward.It is easy to say that Relolutions will be one of the best films of the year. Sadly Reloaded isn't. I can't blame it on the lack of philosophical value as the first film mangaed that to the max but the rushed ending makes you feel as though the directors are just wanting you to get to Revlolutions and forget about this one as soon as possible. Which is a shame because this could have been a great film had they spent more time and thought on it.Gripping experience but deffinately lacking, and it shows. That said it is still one hell of a good ride.4/5","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But despite how ready I was to get disappointed this movie not only met expectations but set the bar even higher!Most of the effects meet the standard set by the first Matrix, and you couldn't possibly expect more.  But then more is exactly what you get and a new standard is set.  Absolutely amazing.The story line does not disappoint either.  In fact it gets cranked up even more than the action does over the first film.  Flat out, if you think you know what the world of The Matrix is all about, what's happening and what it all means... think again!  Like the characters you're in for a rude awakening and another mind-bender even bigger than the original.I can see a lot of people being disappointed or frustrated by the story. But I think they need to realize that this movie is a continuation of the exact same story started in the original movie and that the shifting of perceptions is one of the major themes.My friends and I had no shortage of conversation on the hour and a half ride home after this one.  Discussing everything from plot points and themes in the movie to real-life philosophies about AI, free will, and destiny.In short, it's an amazing film that is at least an order of magnitude greater in both visual and mental stimulation than its predecessor.  I think it's very easy to say that this is one of the absolutely greatest movies of all time.

The kung fu though is overall much better thanks to the actors' additional training time since the first movie. the special effects are on the top of the industry and film history as usual, however there is one complaint to be made about innovation in this movie.  While the 'bullet time' developed by Gaeta in the first movie was a complete innovation, and the introduction of yuen wo ping's wire action fighting into american cinema was a bold move, we have nothing of the sort in this movie.  The first's action amazed on a new level as well as impressed on the basic level.  However in order to escape imitators, the Wachowskis have given us something no one could copy -- because it costs too damn much -- the highway scene, and the 100 agent smith scene. Essentially, they paid their way out of thinking up a new idea, the highway scene, though amazing, didn't bring action to a new level, but simply made it as big as possible.  Within the world of the matrix, where our suspension of disbelief is complete -- we can accept neo flying without too much laughter, and their immediate knowledge of fighting and motorcycle riding is alright in the matrix.  So when the fight scenes in this fantastic world do nothing new, it's like buying your favorite band's new album, and finding out that it's nothing but a collection of remixes.the drama/plot.laugh.  cliches like ""i love you too damn much"" and ""i'm never letting go"" are supposed to get us to believe that trinity and neo are in love?!  yes, the story says they are, yes other characters say they are, but with such stonefaced acting and poor fanboy writing, the love subplot did not succeed.as for the philosophy presented by the movie of causality and free will versus destiny, there is nothing new here.  While the first presented a mixture of philosophies and religious ideologies to create a new idea on the modern world and it's growing electronic foundations, this one does nothing to further that idea.  in fact, it regresses, and provides the same stock answer for every problem the idea of such a huge system like the matrix vs. real world brings up: it's not our purpose to ask.  There are many dramatic monologues that sound disgustingly deep through the use of big words, logic tricks, and tricky writing, but when analyzed, what they say is nothing deeper than a kid saying he stole the candy bar, ""just cause"".the movie does introduce some interesting ideas in terms of its own world however.  unfortunately, they come in the very last quarter of the film, and of course end abruptly in order to get you to watch the third one.in terms of characters, the main ones introduced are painfully undeveloped and depend on the experience of the first movie to make them 3 dimensional. If one were to watch this movie on its own, then it's easy to see how quickly all of the people in the story are made of cardboard, with their one way motivations and actions.conclusion. this sequel was a sellout.  instead of spending time crafting their characters and the complex world in which they lived [which had already captured the audience's imagination], the wachowski brothers opted to forge straight ahead, and pump out two sequels, paying their way out of writing real love, 'human' characters [neo seems more robotic than agent smith does], and a substantial plot.  We would have eagerly waited for a much better movie, but we got this first.  In 5 years, the matrix dvd will be sitting in my dvd player, and the matrix reloaded super special collector's widescreen edition will be sitting in the back of my friends' closets gathering its fifth layer of dust.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'll elaborate this a little, just out of itself. If ""I"" am a ""state"" of ""energy-matter"" that is ""caused"" by a ""reason"" there is indeed no way ""I"" could ""be"" without a ""reason"". And if the ""form"" of ""myself"" is ""defined"" through its ""interactions"" with other ""objects"" and these ""interactions"" are at the same time the ""purpose"" of my ""form"" no action could ever ""deny"" my ""purpose"".If you've read Schopenhauer's ""Die Welt als Wille und Vorstellung"" this will remind you of certain things, but I don't want to misguide anybody here. The line I quoted isn't really about will, it's colder, more scientific. But my point is this. It's pretty easy to dismiss things and takes some effort to interpret things.And those who are willing to take the challenge and go through this movie in search of weltanschauungen and motivations shouldn't miss this film as it offers much.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Did they use their time effectively? Was the wait worth it? In the case of ""The Matrix Reloaded,"" the answer is leaning more towards a ""no."" Heavy on action scenes, light on the thought-provoking dialogue, there is no doubt that this sequel is a different kind of film than it's predecessor, which is vexing, as it comes from the exact same people who brought you the first. On the surface, it's a loud, rip-roaring summer blockbuster with outstanding visual effects and mind-blowing action sequences. But what it has in brawn it severely lacks in brain. A story that is basically bookended by Neo's (Keanu Reeves) desire to save his love interest, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), ""The Matrix Reloaded"" takes a lot of time to get to its point. What little plot is being pushed is constantly interrupted by giant stunt showcases or martial arts extravaganzas. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is a testament to all that is possible with modern film-making, and to that end, it succeeds.What it fails at is telling a compelling story. The plot relies too heavily at times on external media (i.e. video games and an anime home video by the name of ""The Animatrix"") and in all honesty, could have been condensed into the closing chapter, ""The Matrix Revolutions,"" thereby almost negating its existence. What we are left with instead is a film that is half the sum of its predecessor, and which may dazzle the audio and visual senses, but hardly stimulates the brain like a ""Matrix"" movie should. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" stands strong as an action epic  the true summer blockbuster it is  but disappoints when the time comes to tell its story.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Having only seen it once, that being said this film follows an obvious and highly predicable formula of: action / pontificate at great length / adjust sunglasses / more action / pontificate some more, etc. To me this movie was nothing more than a tiresome and cringe-worthy series of (1.) Visually complex, yet utterly sterile and incredibly fake looking action scenes, which again, look more like a video game (and not a particularly good one), rather then a movie. (2.) And then there's the dialog..... which, as many other reviewers have also stated, is criminally bad and often insufferably painful, and that's entirely due to the movies wordy and highly pretentious screen-play. In at least half a dozen scenes this movie torture's you with one lame-ass ""from the future"" after another, who, without fail, indulges in a ""deep"" and lengthy speech; of which most are placidly delivered snore-fests, that tend to ebb and flow around possible/hypothetical out-comes of the future, whereas a few others are fire and brimstone diatribes that mostly focus on berating Neo. But in any case whoever the messenger may be (I found the snotty Frenchman to be the most obnoxious), all of these scenes are overflowing with some of the most exceptionally wordy and singularly pretentious screen-writing ever. Seriously, Matrix Reloaded is loaded with some of the all-time worst dialog, which it's makers SO DESPERATELY want you to be impressed by. But ultimately it comes off as nothing more than conceited nauseating drivel. They really should issue a barf-bag with the purchase of this movie - should you be stupid enough to waste your money on it in the first place.In conclusion Matrix Reloaded, though not completely bereft of artistic merit, is simply a very boring piece of Sci-Fi cheese, which also happens to showcase front and center, some of Keanu Reeves worst acting (it's as if he slept through his roll) and the only reason I finally got around to seeing this movie, a whole 14 years after it's release, is because Mike Nelson and the rest of the Rifftrax crew, gave it the long over-due ripping that it so rightfully deserves. They too have no delusions on how crappy this movie really is and without their commentary it would have been even more boring, to the point of being unwatchable.Matrix Reloaded = sterile, lifeless, super-massively over-rated, Sci-Fi rubbish.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

For all the philosophical conversations breaking down this 'world' and explaining all, there are some particulars that are not fully explained.  I don't understand the limitations of Neo's powers inside the matrix.  He can fly at superspeeds...so why doesn't he just teleport to where he needs to go?  If he can stop bullets, why doesn't he just magically pull in a sword or gun from down the street for instance to help in his fight against the relentless Smith(s)?Also, since these characters have super powers, any acrobatic stunt they perform seems so unimpressive...the fight on the freeway, while VERY well done, didn't have the same type of drama a scene like that usually draws because we cannot relate to people with such power, the world around them has almost no effect.  So it comes across as boring...because being on top of a high speed truck is like nothing to them.  The fight scenes seem plain and redone, like I've seen this kung fu or what have you someplace else (but done with less charisma than by someone like Chan or Li).I just found myself not getting into the world of the Matrix, I found myself getting more involved in X2 since you can relate to the characters.  Even though those characters all have powers, they have weaknesses and still follow understandable laws of physics.Plus the philosophy of ""we hate machines...but we need machines....machines hate us....but they need us"" isn't deep at all, its just circular reasoning...that leads nowhere...how boring.

Here the balance is terribly out of whack. The plot can essentially be summed up in a few sentences, but the extended effects scenes could take an hour to describe. And they're not even crucial to the plot. While I enjoyed this movie, it was more the enjoyment of a roller coaster than a supposedly thought-provoking movie. There are some interesting plot iterations and set-up in Revolutions, but they seem to be poorly tacked on at the end, a reminder that ""oh, yeah, and then this stuff will matter in the third movie"". The much-raved about fight scene between Neo and the Smith flock drags on far too long and looks horribly fake at some instances (very, very video game). Similarly, the non-action parts of the movie feel more like a middling RPG. ""Go here, talk to this person, get this, then fight some more people..."" The first third of the movie (set mostly in Zion) wants to be intriguing plot set-up, but just isn't. The extended rave sequence has even less plot relevance than the overlong fights. Also during this point the warning bells of ""this is like Star Wars!"" go off the loudest. My only other complaint would be the music. With the exception of one techno Latin chorus fight song (itself a poorer version than other examples), the music seemed limp and unequal to the visuals. The soundtrack lacked the driving force of the first one. (The psuedo-patriotic music that cues up during Morpheus' pep talk was particularly annoying.)All in all this is a fun movie. But the fun is at a far more superficial level. Yes, there are unanswered questions, but they just don't seem as important in the first one, where the driving force was the need to know the truth. The Matrix inspired both thought and energy, ironically Reloaded will leave you feeling drained and dazzled by mindless spectacle.5/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I think this hobbles the first sequel more than the second since the first takes place mostly in the Matrix and the second takes place mostly outside of it, but there's still a surprising mundane feeling to the basic plot mechanics that feel like a let down after the promise at the end of the first movie. That being said, you review the movies you get not the movies you wish you got, so, taking the failure of imagination in stride, here we go.It's been some time since Neo woke up and changed the rules of the Matrix. They're freeing more minds than ever and feel like they have the machines on the run. You know, for a sequel to a movie that started so incredibly well, the opening hour of The Matrix Reloaded borders on boring. The slow and steady reveal of reality in the first is replaced by just so much talking about how things have changed. We don't really see any of how things have changed, and we dive headfirst into the entire trilogy's problems which are its insistence that its philosophical musings are more important than the story. Instead of trusting the audience to find the ideas of choice and free will in the actions of the characters, the Wachowskis have the characters talk, and talk, and talk about choice and free will, about belief, and about the situation at hand. Surprisingly little is shown. Even the important information that the machines have started drilling towards Zion, the last human city, is conveyed through dialogue, a choice hobbled by the fact that so much effort went into The Animatrix and the short ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" which ends up acting as a prologue that's not actually part of the film. This push for a multimedia story was a mistake, and they should have really focused on telling the story as well as possible in the actual movies.After endless talk, an extended rave scene meant as defiance against the machines, and a couple of well executed but pointless action sequences, Neo revisits the Oracle and the movie actually feels like it begins...an hour in.But, of course, we also need another long talk about choice and free will, and then she gives him the first in a series of clues that he needs to follow to reach the Source. There's a very video game-esque feel to this where they have to go one place, talk to someone, have a fight, go another place, have another fight, and then get to the place. However, I've always thought that the entire Matrix saga is best when it fully embraces spectacle, and that's ultimately what The Matrix Reloaded does in its last hour. The fight in the palace, the chase through the freeway, and every variation along the way is incredibly well executed. There's a cleaner, glossier aesthetic to the visuals than in the original which robs the action of some of its visceral power, but it's still a great spectacle. The final confrontation with the replicating Agent Smith is tightly filmed in a white corridor, and it works.Now, for all my complaining about talking in these movies, I have to say that the one scene of talking I love is with The Architect. It seems like an odd choice since it's some of the most esoteric stuff told in a cadence and with a vocabulary that seems incredibly unnatural, but so much is revealed that recasts most of what came before. The idea that this is the sixth Matrix is one in particular that I love. The Architect's cold assurance of Zion's destruction is also great. It also completely undercuts the entire idea of prophesies (as another element of control), and anything that says that prophecies are junk gets a thumbs up from me (unlike some other movie I could mention). And then the movie fumbles again.The central love story between Neo and Trinity never worked. It didn't work in the first film, it doesn't work here, and it doesn't work in the third. There's not an iota of chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Carrie Ann Moss, and it really does help that the Wachowskis directed their actors in the sequels the same way that Robert Bresson directed actors to drain performances from them. The influence is supposed to be Stanley Kubrick doing eighty to ninety takes on everything, but the effect is unintentionally what Bresson did on purpose. Every actor except Harold Perrineau as Link feels dead and lifeless. It's not the sort of thing you do to sell a love story. Kubrick knew exactly what kind of performance he wanted from people, so he did takes until he got it. Bresson wanted a world-weariness for his films. The Wachowskis wanted to do something that Kubrick did because he did it, and the end result is an impassioned score over two actors staring at each other blankly. Neo flying to save Trinity, potentially sacrificing all of Zion in the process, even as The Architect talks about how obviously in love Neo is with her, falls flat.Still, as I said, these movies work best as action spectacles, and that this movie has in spades. Every action scene is incredibly well filmed and performed. The only real issue with the visuals in these is the primitive cloth simulations that make the CGI elements plastic. Everything else is vibrant and exciting on a facile surface level, and that's all I have ever really seen even the original as: vehicles for action scenes. The philosophy bores me. The characters are functional more than involving. The plot is an interesting mix of ideas, but it's the action that drives everything. Because of the strength of the action scenes almost entirely on their own do I actually like this movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Having not seen it for many years, and grown considerably since the last time, it manages to continue the narrative of the first movie in a convincing manner. That said, this movie suffers greatly from being the middle child of the original trilogy, being neither a beginning nor end to the story, and I can't help but feel that it's heavily padded to expand its runtime.Whereas the first movie was a more philosophical piece that only came to blows in the most desperate situations, this movie relishes in the almost endless action scenes with greatly exaggerated slow-mo shots and heavily choreographed fights. The action doesn't necessarily distract from the plot, but it can very much seem like they're stalling for time, since they could easily have trimmed the runtime with 30 minutes and it probably would've flowed just as well, or perhaps more ideally merged this with the third movie and eased up on the fight scenes. The fight scenes and the large sweeping shots are also where modern audiences might notice the blatant switching to CG, but is done well enough to not be too distracting, though it's definitely 2003.With that said, I obviously liked the movie. It doesn't feel like they're stalling for time because they're out of ideas, but more to emphasise their fight for survival, something Morpheus' overly dramatic speeches certainly speaks to, himself seeming more devoted to the cause than ever before. It does manage to bring back some of the philosophical questions of the first movie and build a bit further, but doesn't go terribly far, though there's some key elements to the story that you can't miss. While I would've liked more meat to the story, I still feel it's handled pretty well, and while I personally find the whole romance a bit tiresome, it's at least not simply tacked on to please the audience.Love it or hate it, it gets a pass from me for how much I like the premise of the story and sci-fi in general.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Although I wished I never woke up from the made-up reality of a two hour film, that it never ended.And this time- too verbose, too many characters I wished died immediately( the frenchman, Niobe, Link's woman+sister+kids, The Councillor, Persephone, Neo's friend, the other captains, the entire Zion) and not take any more screen time, too many jokes, silly Zion architecture. Not the signs of a bad film, but the signs of just a film.The Matrix(1999) was a revelation, a tight fusion of beautiful cinematography, conscise and intense storytelling, characters that didn't say much, but we knew what was said and why they accepted their fate. That film was unforgettable and profound in every way.This Matrix(2003) was just a movie and didn't have the strength to be the sequel to such a great film. The only redeeming story was Neo- the one who has to take on the fate of the world utterly alone, the one without a way out, without  a choice.This is the only thread that gives me hope until the final film.I hope it is too soon to judge now.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

i like my bad news first, so here are my gripes:  first, and most importantly, the thrill and serendipity of the first film proved impossible to duplicate.  when i walked out of the first matrix movie, i was completely blown away.  after four years of waiting and months of drooling over the trailers my ability to be surprised was lost.  second, several sequences take too long for what they accomplish.  the worst of which is the zion techno/tribal dance scene.  would have been so much better if it were half as long.there are two other common gripes that don't bother me, but i'll list them just to be safe.  the dialogue is, just as in the first matrix, more like a comic book than a shakespearean play.  while this will irk some viewers, it helps establish the atmosphere of the movie.  also, the more complex effects sequences will simply overwhelm many viewers.  i don't usually ascribe to the ""more is more"" philosophy, but i have never seen scenes this complex pulled off so well.now to the good stuff.  the effects.  i knew they'd be good, but wow. they are, bar none, the best special effects i have ever seen in any movie. the philosophical and mythical aspects of the film have been expanded on quite a bit.  there are definitely times when a degree in philosophy would come in handy.  you don't have to understand it all to enjoy yourself, but this movie will give you plenty of ontological and ethical questions to chew on. finally, neither the atmosphere of the matrix universe nor the wachowski brothers touch have not been lost.  lots of cool close ups and camera angles give this film a very cool feel and texture.  overall, one of the best times i've ever had at the movies.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Were we spoilt with ""The Matrix""? A ""must see"" all the same ...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0703668/?ref_=tt_urv","michael-245","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0481932/?ref_=tt_urv","16 May 2003","This is more of a comment on the experience of seeing the first two Matrix films, with some critical commentary.My comment is, has Neo had an impact on the geek? I saw ""Matrix Reloaded"" (MR) at midnight on the night it first opened, just after watching ""The Matrix"" in the same cinema immediately beforehand.I've seen ""The Matrix"" (TM) four times now, and each time I derive something new out of it. In fact, it took until the third viewing to understand most of the fundamental concepts of the film. It is definitely a film that one can become immersed in - one that has a pace that doesn't slow down - the tempo just keeps rising. Leaving the cinema after seeing Neo step out of the phone booth, put his glasses on and slip off - you catch yourself thinking that we really are all in the Matrix - it is all around us. To accept that wanting to live in real world instead of the Matrix is something Morpheus and Co aspire to, is a spin out in itself.So, coming out of the ""reasonably filled"" cinema from seeing TM, I encountered a sea of guys. These guys would traditionally be the sweaty geeks - the type that have no regard for their personal appearance. The ""Trekkies"", who, when gathered in a cinema, put out a collective BO that is unpleasant, yet somehow reassuring to experience (it lets you know that there still are geeks in this world).But, for the MR, the sea of guys - literally hundreds of them, all had that Neo cool. Well dressed, many on mobile phones, not too stinky. I'd estimate that 2 - 5 per cent of the viewing audience was female.This was my reason for going to the first public screening of MR - to not only see the film, but to be part of the experience of seeing it with a kind of brethren. I was reassured that I assimilated with these cool geeks more than your ""I don't get out and mix with normal people too much"" kind of geek.So, what did I think about the film? I came out of it a little disappointed. Now, all of you who have seen TM more than 30 times and are probably, as I type, watching MR for the fifth time since its release 36 hours ago, will probably blindly declare that I am a heathen.MR just didn't have the impact of the first film. Some of the most exciting parts of TM were grasping the concepts, watching the stunning visual effects, seeing the story develop and increase tempo, relating to Neo and his troubles with the world. Witnessing the slow motion, normal speed and ramping of fighting scenes, shooting scenes, the warping of the image. All of that stuff. Importantly of all, watching Sydney, Australia as the vital backdrop to this amazing movie. Like New Yorkers having pride that their home town is the key to films like ""Spiderman"", Aussies feel the same way about this film - even if I am from Melbourne! (FYI, there is a great Melbourne / Sydney rivalry between people who live in their respective city, but as Australians showcasing our country to the world on films like this, we proudly put those issues aside).Now, going into MR, we expect all of those visual effects. You almost become complacent, which is a terrible thing. I had to remind myself, ""Hey, Neo is being attacked by 5 Agent Smiths!"" And a few minutes later, ""Knucklehead, Neo is being attacked by 100 plus Agent Smiths! That is a very impressive effect!"" All of the Agent Smiths attacking Neo seemed so real, it didn't seem to be an effect - that is something truly impressive.As a sign note, I would bet Hugo Weaving, who is an unassuming Australian actor, must get a huge kick out of playing this sort of role and seeing himself projected on the screen in that manner.Similarly, watching the much talked about freeway action was truly amazing. The way all of the characters ducked and weaved through traffic, even travelling again it, without any hesitation, was a sign of the strength and conviction that Neo, Morpheus  and Co have in each other and cause. The quote from Morpheus, ""What if tomorrow the war could be over ... isn't that worth dying for?"" is shown off throughout the film.But, most of Neo's powers are now assumed. He can stop bullets, he is a great martial arts fighter - we've had that established in the previous film now, and that's part of what's missing in MR. Still, there were times when Neo showed new skills - ""Neo's doing his Superman thing again"" - his flying skills were put to great use, both visually and for the story, towards the climax of the film.Aside from the opening scenes of the film, the first half hour of MR, the tempo was slow, almost falling into melodrama. I wouldn't have raised an eyebrow if the cinema collective had of yelled out ""Finally, some action!!"" as the tempo started to wind up. The opening screen, Trinity's mission, was truly impressive and made me think, ""if the start is like this, we're in for a hell of a ride!"" As you know, a common film technique is to flash forward at the start of the film, to something that is significant at the end. I made a note of this when watching Trinity in action.Then the pace slowed down. We saw Zion, we established that Neo has cult status among his people. We saw the political processes at work in Zion. A necessary evil to establish this background story? Perhaps. But get me back to the action that the Matrix is all about, please!So, ultimately, I think fans of TM will not be disappointed by MR. We were just spoilt too much with the brilliance of TM on a number of levels - story, visuals, concepts - a lot of things that MR would find difficulty to top. Having said that, MR is obvious a ""must see"" for all fans of TM. It all concludes in just 6 short months!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If you really want to know how bad this sequel is, go back and see the first movie again.  The first one and RELOADED don't compare, in terms of coherence as a movie.  I pity the poor guy who sees RELOADED without watching the first one (there must be like 2 or 3 people left that have actually done this.).  Yeah, the fight scene is good, and the chase scene is without equal.  Yeah, sequels cannot be as good as the original.  But after the fulfilling first film, I was expecting more than a music video.  The [fake] philosophizing that flowed incredibly in the first movie gets diluted, dumbed-down, and forced in this one.  The stuff that the Oracle says isn't slick anymore (""Werewolves""??  C'mon).  It's as if all the supporting actors simply mimic each other's (and mostly Morpheus') deep thoughts.  And there are *seriously* corny lines that shouldn't have gotten past the quality inspectors-- all at key points of action, all of which accentuate Keanu's wooden acting.The original movie has ""replay value"" and still remains good.  This one I really, REALLY wanted to like, but it's getting dated already.  Lucas might have tried it and flushed Star Wars down the drain with the prequels (As of this writing, I can't imagine how Episode III could possibly salvage the series.), but the Wachowskis can't try to sneak a franchise this smart/pseudo-intellectual with poor plot/dialogue development.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The fight scenes drag on far too long.  The dialog drags.  Everything drags.  There was easily 20 minutes of footage that could have been removed.  The rave/sex scene should have been cut in half. Better editing would have gone a *long* way to improving this film.Reloaded's story lacks the coherence of The Matrix.  The plot lines that tie the action sequences together are not nearly so strong.  Or maybe the bad editing made them hard to pick up on.Despite all of this, Reloaded is fun.  It has more of The Matrix's action, with some fun enhancements.  The kung fu scenes are really good, just too long.  The new characters are somewhat interesting and do bring some complexity to the screen.  The dialog in the last half of the movie is interesting, but most will find it hard to follow.Reloaded is not The Matrix.  The lack of resolution can be forgiven (but Revolutions damn well better wrap things up), the story isn't as compelling, and the editing is bad.  But it's still a decent film and worth watching.Let's hope that The Brothers do the right thing and let a real editor do a pass over Revolutions.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Since then we have seen countless imitators both good and bad.  With that being said, The Matrix Reloaded f/x engineers has once again done a fantastic job at creating the virtual world of the matrix.  From the big brawl to the hyper intensive car chase, the f/x crew is sure to be nominated once again.  Now on to the bad.  The story is mind numbing!  The conversation with architect (of the matrix) is one that would require multiple viewings just to comprehend.Overall, this is a good movie, but not as good as the original.

There are two schools of thought for this: either you loved the first one so much that the second will be disappointing due to high expectations, or sequels just always suck.That's a rather defeatist way to look at movies. First, there have been numerous successful sequels. ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was quite good, establishing a large chunk of story and still managing to be involving. Same for ""X2"", which wasn't perfect but was very enjoyable.So sequels can be good. This is just a case of one that isn't.There is a widely-established myth that ""The Matrix"" was a perfect movie. It definitely wasn't. It was very derivative, ripping most of its technobabble and sci-fi base from Dick and Gibson. Where it excelled was the way the story was told. The world was (mostly) believable and gritty, the characters very involving, the actors perfect.The sequel fails because the Wachowski brothers seem to have fallen victim to the same trap that befell George Lucas: they believe people loved their movie for the plot (which was shoddy at best) and spend an inordinate amount of time expounding upon said plot. And expounding. And so on.There are so many lengthy scenes of people debating emptily about the meaning of life. Very little is actually said in these debates and lectures. It's just rambling, and it becomes irritating. Most egregious is the final speech given by ""The Architect"", where it is obvious that the Wachowski brothers were thinking ""If we make it confusing and use big words, people will assume it's deep."" The Architect prattles on about fate and choice (for the fiftieth time) while 400 images of Neo do painful emoting exercises on the background screens. It's unbearable.The problem with the movie is that these scenes make up the majority of the film, along with excruciatingly long and detailed kissing and romantic scenes. This is not an epic, it is sci-fi schlock with very good action scenes. When did the Wachowski's start to believe the fanboi hype?Another major problem is that the action is amazingly well choreographed, but not in the least bit compelling. Neo is Superman, he cannot be killed and we know this. It is unlikely that Morpheus or Trinity will die (although the possibility of one is presented as a tease). Thus, when they fight you're just admiring the choreography.Jackie Chan has repeatedly noted that in order for a fight scene to sell, people have to be hit. The viewer has to _feel_ the impact. But it is obvious that the punches aren't landing in this movie. Everyone is fighting so fast and doing so many acrobatic movies that the punches are secondary. In the Burly Brawl (the popular name for the fight against the myriad Agent Smiths) Keanu is just doing kata, dancing and spinning and it never feels like any punches land.That and the over-reliance on bullet time and wire-fu seriously detract from the battles. In several instances you can clearly see where the wires take over, so Keanu will smack someone and they will jolt up, then back at an incredible speed as the wire pulls them into some obstacle. It's just not compelling. Real fans of kung fu movies want to see real fights, not dancing. Not to mention the way Keanu escapes from danger (flying away in a Superman pose) just begs the question, why doesn't he do it sooner? If he can swoop in and save his friends, why waste time punching and kicking?I don't hate the film, it had its high points. I expect it would be a better experience at home, with a remote control, to skip past all the pretentious speechifying and cheesy romance scenes.But in the end I can't help but feel taken. ""The Matrix"" was not planned as a trilogy (no matter what they tell you now, it was a standalone movie and was ""developed"" into a trilogy when it became a success, which is why it took four years). Thus the newer movies are plagued by a feeling of padding, of ""haven't we already seen and heard this ten times?"" that is neither compelling nor interesting.It has an 8.1 rating here on IMDB, and it is already a financial smash. How ironic that a movie about being enslaved by machines has turned into its own mechanical franchise, where fanbois and yes-men salivate and prostrate themselves before the altar.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Along the way, many little hints and clues and rumors were spread all around and when every new trailer was released for the movie everyone had to see it. But what happened to The Matrix Reloaded doesn't have to happen to every sequel. Quite a bit of people will say the point of number 2 in the trilogy is to set- up things for number 3 so it's pointless to complain about plot gaps. That's not always the case. For example, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom didn't quite set up for The Last Crusade. A lot of weight rests on the shoulders of sequels: they have to a) entertain b) be as good as the first one or even better c) have better effects then the first one and d) be able to stand- out alone. The Matrix Reloaded briefly entertains with it's edgy and kinetic action sequences such as the twenty or so minute long Highway Chase, but sometimes the action feels a bit stretched. For example, when Neo was fighting off the 100 Agent Smiths (something that has been advertised about the movie just about everywhere), why couldn't he have just flown away in the first place? In The Matrix all the action sequences made sense, they connected with the story, and they just made you go ""Wow"".  In terms of characters and character development, there isn't anything improved on from number one. Things get worse. It seems that Keanu Reeves is now totally concerned with flying around and getting into fights with people, and he just says his lines with no real intensity. Lawrence Fishburne tries to be a leader- like figure with his ""uplifting"" speech to Zion which he delivered terribley. The rest of the cast is fine, except for Hugo Weaving who seems to be there just to complicate things. With so many flaws, how can this movie not be bad? Well, there is an occasional perfect balance of story- line and action, and things get very suspenseful and dramatic. The action sequences are quite amazing, and the special effects are dazzling. Yes, The Matrix is of better then this sequel, and yes things are left open quite a bit for The Matrix Revolutions. Oh and the Zion scenes weren't very good. 7.5/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Being a long time fan of both speculative sci-fi and Hong Kong movies, as well as a big fan of the Wachowski's first film (Bound), I saw The Matrix the night it opened. And it blew me away. It was the most potent, flawless combination of brain candy and eye candy I've seen to date. So I should have expected that the Wachowski's would find it impossible to match that feat, much less surpass it. But I would have been happy if they'd at least come close.First of all, if you were as turned on as I was by the more cerebral aspects of the first film, you'll be severely disappointed by Reloaded. The only cool idea in the film (actually, the only idea period) is definitely too little, too late (near the end). There is next to no plot, just an eventually tiresome sequence of (admittedly elaborate) action scenes. But the film still might have been worthwhile if not for the often painfully fake animation in these scenes. Until computers can generate images of moving humans that are indistinguishable from real ones, all filmmakers should avoid like SARS using fully animated people for fight scenes. Animated monsters or environments can sometimes achieve verisimilitude, but only because we have no real monsters to compare them to, and environments aren't in constant flux and motion like a living being. But we are simply too aware of exactly what a person, especially one in motion, should look like. There are whole sequences in the multiple Agent Smith fight and the car chase where everyone--worst of all whoever the center of attention happens to be--is animated, and it's depressingly obvious. I spent agonizing minutes during these scenes trying to block my awareness of it, to no avail. And I'm not some FX tech geek who gets off on exposing the clockwork, so to speak. When I see a movie like this, I want nothing more than to be duped. But the abundance of truly weak illusion ruined (for me, at least) every scene it was used in. And that's pretty much all the action scenes. And that's pretty much the whole film.I have some more minor complaints as well. Such as: while I'm not a big techno music fan (although I giddily jumped out of my seat when Meat Beat Manifesto came belting out of the walls during a scene in The Matrix), I thought the use of music during fight scenes in the first movie was invigorating, brilliant, and unequalled in effect. Unfortunately, the music used during fight scenes in Reloaded is like a watered down, safe-for-your-grandmother mix of beats and typical orchestral music (which equals feces).I wanted to love this movie. I expected to love this movie. But I didn't even come close--and I don't think this is a case of letdown due to unreasonably high expectations. The Wachowski's really seem to have sacrificed brains for beauty, and flawed beauty at that. This is a shame, especially when they've demonstrated in the past that they are capable of both simultaneously (Bound was just as smart and gorgeous as The Matrix, although in a more low-key way). Not just capable of it, but masters of it. I can only hope that Revolutions will return to the cleverness and visual purity of the first part of the trilogy.I think it's still probably worth your money to see, though. Especially if you're not bothered by transparent computer animation.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first one was amazing visually too but this second one was a visual feat for the digital artists.the storyline in this one is intricate.  what you thought was essential no longer seems so important and what you thought the point of the story was becomes only a leg of the journey to the end.the anticipation for the conclusion due out in november of this same year is almost too much to bear.  i am lucky enough to catch it onthe day it opens...to keep me busy til november i will watch it again ...and again and again...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie starts of slow, with a lot time wasted in Zion. Who would really start a big party when the sentinels are just 36 hours away. I think this was just an excuse to show some nice girls topless or with see through blouses. Luckily the middle part gives all the action and special effects you would expect from the sequel. The third part of the movie expands the plot, giving more information as to how the matrix came in existence. The end is much too abrupt, but then they'll want us to go and see the third movie. I think if they had cut half an hour out of this movie, and half an hour out of the next (this is speculation of course) and put both sequels together as one movie it would have been just as great as the first.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But referring to the first part, the story is very disappointing! You feel that the Wachowski Brothers worked under pressure (maybe Joel Silvers pressure:). They made a complicating story, which turns into a ridiculous sense of the Matrix. Whatever, Action, Special Effects, Martial Arts... just Eye Candy. It is just another example, that sequels are to 99% not so good, as the first part - in this case, it is not a breakthrough milestone in film history.

I woke up this morning and thought more about it and loved it more. Sure it does have it's flaws(zion, not the best acting,etc)but overall it was a great flick. And if you are complaining about the ""to be concluded"" then you are an idiot. I along with every smart person alive guessed that the movie would end with a huge cliffhanger. And so it did. And that is the reason i am waiting for revolutions to be released. The graphics, especially when Neo flies....WOAH. It blew me away. Some of the fight scenes mightve lasted a little too long but they were still amazing. The highway scene was a let down for me but it was still a good scene. Overall, I'd give the movie an 8.5 out of 10 and i'd recommend that you go see this if you havent seen it. If you have seen the first matrix, be warned that the plot is going to change and your eyes will be even more opened to what is real and what isn't.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Youll be amazed with how much stuff you missed the first time through. I keep reading reviews on here about it being boring and the plot not existing, but i dont know what movie those people saw.  The one i saw was great action cool characters and a plot that while it is a fundamental story of good vs. evil it has hints and secrets that you will have to figure out. I'm writing this review quickly so people will actually read it so bare with me.  The first time through the action will knock you flat then the second time it will do the same then the story will start coming together for you, so if you havent seen it then dont listen to the naysayers just check it out challenge yourself, mayeb you are smarter than the movie but who cares enjoy it for what it is and don't say it has no plot or point because thats insulting the creators of the film who im sorry to offened anyone on here made a better movie than i believe any of you given the resources could possibly create.In the end its a great movie and will be the most entertaining and thought provoking movie you will see until 28 days later, so check it out and ignore the imperfections because their few and far between. But if you didnt like it the first time through give it another shot it might work for you, it did for me.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The effects of the original were awesome. They managed to seamlessly integrate the CG shots into the live action without distracting the audience or diverting from the story. In many ways, it was the new Star Wars.Now take The Matrix, remove all those good points, and what you are left with is Matrix Reloaded. Once again Hollywood and it's over-eager search for sure fire money spinning blockbusters strikes again. If men are supposed to always think with what's beneath their waistline, then Hollywood surely does, except here we're talking about their wallet.The main problem with MR is that the story telling has all but disappeared. What we have been left with is a blend of uninspiring opaque dialog, mixed with contrived action sequences. It left me thinking that there really was no story line at all. There was of course, but it was just well hidden. Instead, the focus of MR was split. Firstly, it attempted to increase the mysticism factor by using language in such a way that film geeks all over the world will be reading meaning into phrases that were never intended to mean anything at all. In many ways this resembles a new religion, except here people are reading from a film, not the Bible or the Holy Qur'an. Secondly, MR tried to outdo the first film in terms of the scale of the effects, without asking a) should we, and b) will it look any good. The answer to both being no.Producers and studios now seem to regard the new crowd puller as special effects. Effects movies are larger than life when done well, and provide the spectacle that everyone loves to see when they go to the movies. But effects alone are insufficient to make a good film, as George Lucus only now seems to be learning.The scene where Neo is fighting a crowd of Agent Smiths was undoubtedly one of the most ambitious effects shots to date. The sheer logistics of coordinating that scene must have been frightening. The problem, apart from being too long, was that it was obviously CG. The rendering of Neo was so poor it reminded me of that awful kite surfing sequence in Die Another Day. The camera movements were so erratic and overengineered that it forgot the number one rule of special effects; to look convincing, always try to mimic a real world camera rig. David Fincher loves to use CG camera moves (see Fight Club, Panic Room), and you rarely notice when he does, because he sticks to moves that the audience have seen before and are confortable with. MR's camera moves for this sequence were straight from a games console, overdone and over worked.A major bone of contention amongst members of internet forums talking about MR, is how consistent the films 'rules' are from film to film. For example, in the original Matrix, Morpheus is unable to beat agents in a fight. In the sequel however, he seems to be much more adept at kicking agent butt. Of course, since this is a fictional world, you can usually find a way to explain this, but it nevertheless leaves fans feeling cheated. Other examples; why didn't Neo 'jump' into any agents to kill them, like he (supposedly) did to Agent Smith in the first film? Why? Because that would have spoilt the plot. Why didn't Neo run away from all those Agent Smiths earlier? Because that would have shortened the fight and meant less special effects. Similarly, later on in the movie, he could have easily killed the bad guys at the beginning of a fight, but he decided to string it out. So do we believe that Neo's got a sadistic streak - or did the producers just want a longer sequence, hmmm...If the Matrix Reloaded were itself a computer program, you could write it in three lines:
1) Action sequence2) Technobabble3) Repeat until run out of money.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

For the rest of the story Neo and the rebellions of Zion have to figure out how they can stop 250,000 probes, who want to destroy Zion, in 72 hours. While this happens Neo has nightmares about Trinity and realizes that her fate is in his hands.I saw the movie last night in the cinema with 2 friends of mine. It was quite amazing what my eyes saw in those 2 hours and 20 minutes. These special effects are the best I've seen, for now, together with LOTR and Star Wars: AOTC. There are some new things: we get to know Neo in superman style which is pretty cool when you see it, Neo and Trinity can't miss each other for a second, Jada Pinkett-Smith and Monica Bellucci join in, Agent Smith has found a way to replicate himself, the rest you have to find out yourself.The Matrix Reloaded surpasses his original mostly on the technical level. There aren't so much gunfights like in the first one. The sequel stresses the kung-fu scenes more now and they are magnificent and will take your breath away. This movie is also a bit more humorous than the original and I have no complaints about that. I like to smile and laugh.
The only bad point in the movie is that it's quite complicated sometimes and some scenes aren't really cut out to be in a sf-movie like this, I think. If I'd compare it with the first Matrix it's just as good. The action and visual effects are better, the characters are still good and the humor is also better. However the story in the Matrix Reloaded isn't better than in the first, some things I didn't understand really well and there's a little too much kissing between Neo and Trinity. But I don't deny that this is a big step on technical level. This is, just like it's predecessor, a masterpiece and I enjoyed and loved watching it.9.5/10 (for both matrix-films)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If you expect the sequel to be as groundbreaking as the original, you'll be disappointed; but if you're happy to see more of the same, just bigger and better, you'll have a great time. The philosophical questions this time round are more concerned with free will and determinism, and the special effects (despite the hype) are truly amazing, although some of the action sequences go on for a bit too long and there could be more dialogue. You get a wider perspective than in the original; because they assume you've seen the first film, and thus have a good grasp of the basics of the Matrix universe (how it works physically, for instance), there is more exploration of different areas, characters, and so on. The insights into the workings of Zion are especially interesting. I strongly recommend seeing this in the cinema as it's the only way you can really appreciate the scale and detail of the special effects.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I watched the film a half year ago when it just had come out. That the movie was going to blow my head off with special effects was pretty obvious, and it did. Not literally of course.The special effects were astonishing, just like in the LOTR films. The fight with about 60 agent Smiths was pretty cool, but it lost its coolness after it took too much time. The highway scene was really terrific and it didn't lose its coolness. And the Wachowski brothers build their own highway just for this movie. Well done.The story was still good, but there were some things that really bugged me, like that dancing scene in Zion, or the French accent of the Merovingian. There was too much kissing between Neo and Trinity, even though they are in love. The sex scene, well that was ok, because I understood the message of it. Someone on the site explained a lot of the movie and the scene took part in his explanation, and I understood the movie and the sex scene a whole lot better by it. And the humor in the film, oh man. I've got no problem with a laugh in a pretty serious movie, but this humor was as dry as the environment of a dromedary.A thing I enjoy the most about the Matrix is the story and the philosophy behind it. The first movie really showed that side of the story, this movie also gives some philosophic information, but the problem is that the Wachowski brothers make it too complicated, and they shouldn't have done that, because it wasn't necessary. And even though I like thinking about a movie afterwards, this was just too much mumbo jumbo.With a conclusion this movie is worth a 7 out of 10, no more, no less.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The battle with Agent Smiths and Neo (Agent Smith is one of my favorite movie villians) was allright. The action was great, but the fight a bit too long. The movie started to turn with the chase between the good guys, the agents and two awesome characters, The Twins. All in all, I will see the movie again at the theater just to see if I like it without the hype. I will stay until the end this time because I heard the trailer for the third movie is after the credits.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With mind blowing visual effects, such as the first scene where Trinity jumps out a window, and we show broken glass flying in bits and pieces, with the awesome sound effects to go with it!( By this time, I already began to literally drool in the theater, with my girlfriend screaming out:""EEWWW""!) Another great part, is the fighting scene ( heh, witch one? So many fighting scenes!!) where Neo is battling like 100 agent Smiths.  They really did an excellent job at rendering all the agents and making it look so real!As well as finally getting a fighting scene done right, instead of having one agent attack at a time, like in all other movies, we see like 5 agents rushing and punching there way to revenge! The way it should be done, I mean, come on, in real life, we would see a whole gang swarm around this one guy, instead of saying:""hey, eh Bill? Is it your turn to try and beat him up or is it Steve's?""...The story itself blew me away.  I remember asking myself:"" I don't think the sequel is gonna be that good, I mean, the first one was all about knowing what the matrix is, so what are they gonna show us now to make an even bigger impact?"" Now I know.  The very fact of having Neo find the guy who INVENTED the Matrix and the explanation of Neo's being (that he's ""the one"")just adds so much more effect and understanding to the entire story!All in all, the director's did a great job at not disappointing the public with another sequel. Instead, they succeeded in bringing forth a great trilogy, by combining love, action, a little bit of comedy and an amazing tale on to the big screen!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The writers have read their psychology books and try to express this principle in the movie. It's interesting to see how determinism effects the choices of Neo and especially Morpheus, but at a certain point 'I get it'. They didn't have to go on and on about it.Furthermore, there's too many action sequences: I saw the trick in the first movie, I know it looks awesome but more action sequences don't make a movie better.Concerning the love scene between Neo and Trinity (and I quote a friend of mine): the Wachowski Brothers took a good look at George Lucas and completely ruined the scene...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The original Matrix really puts Lawrence Fishburne at the helm, as the captain who holds true to his beliefs even when the source of those is not so certain. While derivative of many other sources, the movie is far more enjoyable than I expected, and left us with a feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction without actually putting an end to it all.Which is why I feel sick about The Matrix: Reloaded. The highway battle scene is long, drawn out and predictable. Morpheus' speech to Zion with the subsequent rave is hollow and without feeling. There's no *heart* to this movie, which is essentially what the Matrix original was all about. Instead of an intelligent film with excellent build up to well-planned action sequences, we get a confused plot with bullets and bullet-time thrown together in hopes of distracting us from the fact that we don't know what's going on. The Neo/Trinity sex scene is a blatant attempt to do just that, and has no bearing on the plot whatsoever.(Not to mention that it shows all the wrong things in that scene, but that's just me as a dude talking.)The grit and goth-techno-punk style of the first film is lost as the techno side takes over and we are left with an unfeeling, unimaginative (looks are not everything, kiddos) film. Go watch the first Matrix, and just suffice it to say that Neo frees the people. It's better to consider it that way than where the Wachowski brothers take it.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

The plot is just...I can't say what I want to say, for it would give away to much.George Lucas has for too long been considered the creator of the greatest Science Fiction Trilogy ever created, but if Matrix Revolutions (to which there is a preview after the credits, dont walk out early and miss it)is of the same high standard as the previous Matrix films (which i see no reason why it should not even be the best in the serise)then Star Wars will have to be considered second best.  The Wachowski Brothers, as directors, are simply Brilliant.  This Matrix is not just an exibition for over priced effects, it is also, in many ways, a genuine work of art.The only complaint I would have (at this point, i have only just gotten back from my viewing, and trying to put out my thoughts as quickly as i can) would be that Reeve's lack of acting ability is detremental to some of the more delicate scenes in the movie, though perfect for other, less touching scenes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Though the situation gets worse when the machines have located Zion and closings in. So Neo goes sees the Oracle who instructs Him to reach the Source of the Matrix with the help of a program known the Keymaker to shut the Matrix down. Reloaded had allot to live up to with the world phomenom the first film left on the public. A sequel was very attipactined by everyone unfortunately it doesn't leave the same impact that the first did. While the the first manages to rely on it's unquire effect mix with it's philosophical theme. Reloaded tries to double down on the symbolism and relay to heavy on it's action. Many of the actions are rather subpar the practical fights are great they flow well and they are fast, but this movie far to clean. With Neo there's never no real danger what so ever with him, the first it felt like he could actually be killed so your not as invested. The fight scene with smith in the park he's surrounded by all these smiths it should be Awesome. It's ruined by the fact that one it goes on to long to the point it's comedic. Two the cg is bad it stands out really bad in this they relayed way to heavy on it here just a moshpit of smith's it's more funny then intense. The highway chases is more where it's at, because you actually buy Trinity and Morpheus are actually in danger. And the mix of practical and cg blends better. As for the characters Neo and Trinity relationship just as the last there's no emotion they express so little that yeah they work for each other. But neo is an idiot in this he withhold so much from everybody things that are kinda crucial. Trinity while still badass is still as dry as Sand. Morpheus is pretty much the same philosophical motivation p, stoicism who believes in Neo if you like in the first you'll like it here and viscera. Another side point is while they keep things going in the Matrix the whole subplot with Zion in danger it nice that you see this place,but they barely cut back to it. You get like one shot of the machine approaching you don't feel danger it's just padding for the conclusion with Revolutions.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

No doubt it justifies an R rating.  If I could take that out I would rate it a 9 out of 10.This is the middle movie in a trilogy and it is designed to be a cliff hanger.  It is.  I thought that the plot was set up about as well as it could be so that Reloaded could stand on its' own as a story and still be a middle movie.  The series of scenes where Morpheus, Neo, and Trinity attempt to rescue the key maker are wonderful and simply amazing.  It is quite a challenge these days to actually develop action scenes that have new elements to them.  In my opinion Reloaded was able to do so and delivered a ten out of ten for action.  The scenes on the highway are an exciting concoction mixed out of the inherent danger of a car chase, evading the agents, and trying to escape from the Twins.The new characters, such as the Twins, the key maker, and the other programs, were very interesting.  As the plot unfolds the writers unwrap information about the Matrix and its inhabitants which add some surprises, similar to the revelations in the first movie.I would also rate the acting up a notch from the Matrix, especially Carrie-Anne Moss.  The supporting cast was very well chosen and did a great job.Overall, this movie was well worth the wait.  Matrix fans will not be disappointed, others can enjoy it just for the action.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

One glaring weakness of the Wachovski brothers is that they do not stage or direct love scenes well.  Very mechanical.  One doesn't root for Neo and Trinity as a couple as the Wachovski's gave their relationship no depth.  Of course, maybe they wanted to give the whole film a ""machanical"" feel for a reason we might or might not learn in Matrix Revolutions (3rd in the series).More Zen conversations covering freewill, choice, destiny, deja vu, life-as-game, betrayal, man's dependency upon machines, etc.Great admiration of the special effects wizardry (very realistic) and equally high praise for the several extended satisfying fight sequences.I don't quite understand the casting of Jada Pinkett Smith as a captain of one of the vessels; I couldn't spot her motivation.  Some ""red herring"" former love interest of Morpheus who likes someone else.  Big deal.  Never fully developed.Veteran character actor Anthony Zerbe was a sight for sore eyes as one of the counsel of Zion; he more than acquits himself as a paternal presence, a role that disappears for Morpheus in this second installment.Several industrial music numbers were provided by Juno Reactor, Rage Against the Machine, and Davbe Mathews Band, especially over the endless credits. If you like that sort of electronica.  Could have used more bass.Not the kind of film that leaves you spent from any emotional outpouring. There is none.  But intellectually diverting.Carrie-Anne Moss is fun to watch.  The love scene with Neo in Zion seemed contrived and unnecessarily long.  Was it supposed to go somewhere? 
Glaring plot holes may not be plot holes if addressed in the third film of the series. So it's hard to criticize when the film ends with the words, ""To Be Concluded"".  Leaves you feeling you saw only half the film.  That can't be satisfying in and of itself.Stay through the credits to see a trailer for the third installment.  The preview has a guy wearing a Robojox type machine he runs with his hands. Impressive.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Now i will admit the first half hour or so were slow, and the philosophy while cool and everything really didnt add a lot to the story. But all that aside look at the action and the plot which many have neglected to mention has thickened and become much more involving, but i wont ruin the end for anyone.Now i will admit almost every scene in the film seemed to drag but if you think about any other movie, they always drag at some points and have a few interesting scenes.  But with this movie you have the scenes that drag that are still better than the good parts of most movies, that lead up to the scenes that completely blow away anything you have ever seen before.Also i think that they made these scenes long for a reason,not the dialogue but the fighting, it is meant to show how difficult and arduous the fight has become for out characters. Beacause after Neo's 15 minute fight with the Smith's he says ""that was the first time i have felt like dying"".So complaint after complaint if you really think about it there is a ryme to their reason, the fight scenes are meant to show difficulty in the long battle they are in, and the seemingly pointless dialogue all has a way of playing itself out in the end, i would use more examples but I dont want to ruin the film for anyone.Bottom line: I thought the way this film was made was amazing and well worth the money and time spent, and I will be very suprised if anything can even touch this , this year besides its own sequel and The Return of the King. 9/10 upon second viewing i think it will be 10/10(might have missed something).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Yes, the first 20 minutes of the film I was a bit disappointed.  I was expecting this movie to blow me away like no other movie.  Every day that passes before  I saw it tonight made the hype grow.  Finally tonight I saw it and I come away very pleased.  I got over my disappointment of the beginning because then the heart of the movie appeared.  The freeway scene is unbelievable.  It is the heart of this movie.  Not to mention the hundred man Smith fight.  These two movies are what washed away the disappointment and brought true Matrix action to the screen.  There are times when the love scenes and complicated explanations get over the top, but overall these will be washed away by the visuals and intensity of the action scenes.  This is truly a sequel that lives up to the predecessor.  I just hated the way it ends.  You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.  It makes perfect sense why Revolutions will be released so soon.  You will enjoy this movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Stop there. This film lacks the 'oomph' and wow factor the original had- its script is less inspiring, the characters seem flatter and of course it has keanu reeves acting- which seems flatter since the first film. True its a very watchable film- and i must admit the 100-agent fight in the backalleys was one of the greatest i've ever seen, but those expecting a film along the lines of the Matrix will be dissappointed. The brothers have concentrated way too much on memorable explosions, fist fights and set pieces and not enough on interesting scriptwriting, something which made the first film stand out. To be fair, the first film had the advantage that it was an original idea- we'd heard it all before by the second film and there was no significant revelations to be made. Nevertheless, it held together and despite the atrocious dancing scene (10 minutes of idiots jumping up and down), the film picked up towards the end. Lets hope it continues improving for the final installment in November, and that the Wachowski brothers realised the truth for this film... There is no script.Jas","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, I found that the original movie was 10 times smarter and philosophic than this second installment. I found Reloaded to be filled with confusing double-talk that just kept going around in circles, whereas in the first Matrix, it was more linear, and it had a greater sense of being placed at the right spots in the movie. This is where Reloaded is a little unbalanced. The philosophy itself was also deeper in the original Matrix.

I was just beginning to think that bullet time technology was overused and essentially played out, but man, was I wrong.  I can't wait for the third one. Also, be sure to stay until the end of the credits to see a preview of the next movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

When the first Matrix came out back in 1999, it became an instant success: it had a provoking message, state of the art special effects and truly dazzling gravity-less fights. Within a year hundreds of movies referenced in bigger or smaller amounts, the fights that changed movie History. It isn't necessary to be the movie's Oracle, to understand that sooner or later the sequel (or maybe two!) would be coming with the underling of being truly essential to the story. And as they said many times troughout the movie, upgrades have been done. In every possible aspect... of technology. All the subtileness of the first movie is now gone to leave room for special effects fanfare and sound galore. However the storyline and provoking messages were lost among the four year lasting filming, that clearly only took that long for the sake of its dazzling action sequences and special effects; so it is sad to report that after four years of waiting, Reloaded is clearly inferior to the predecessor, because the Watchowskis pushed farfetched more than they actually could, so this sequel commits all the mistakes the lower sequels do: reference success movies as much as they can. Regarding that, Star Wars fans will rejoice, since the references to the galaxy far, far away abound -- the whole of Zion, the counsil and the counselors, the ships and the trio of heros. But the filmmakers weren't satisfied: they had to invade the comic books, specially the far better X2: Neo can take any hard hit like if he had an iron skeleton like Wolverine; he's telechinetic like Jean Grey; he controls bullets like Magneto, and if it wasn't enough he had to be superman either. The film can be nitpicked - as it is being gradually - but it is not that bad, popcorn at its most. So far the year has clearly a winner: X Men 2 over the Matrix Reloaded, Hugh Jackman over Keanu Reeves, and while The Matrix has dozens of fights and slightly better special effects, X Men 2 has Nightcrawler's homicide attempt on the president, that solely beats the entire Reloaded thing.7 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The scenes that Oracle and Architect explain about the Matrix are too long and boring. I felt like I was in some kind of philosophy lecture rather than in a theater. Movies shouldn't explain verbally too much.  That's why it's called ""movie"" and not ""talkie"".The action sequels are amazing and spectacular but they are not as fresh as the first Matrix and they are also too long.  I got bored while Neo was beating the crap out of the agents but they kept increasing. The scene when Neo flies like Super Man is embarrassing.The scene that shows some dance party in the city also is uncessarily long.The editin is one of the biggest reasons why this film is so boring and rough.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There were a few good scenes, the Freeway chase, the Neo vs Agent Smith x 100, and that was really all that kept me going. Yet I still found myself wondering if I'd done the right choice by seeing The Matrix 2.Sadly, I somewhat was correct. Yet the funny thing is I had very low expectations for this movie. And the Wachowskis did a wonderful job of making me disappointed I saw this movie. The plot was nonexistent, the dialogue and acting were almost as bad as a porno movie's acting, and well, there was the recycled SFX. I remember reading a few interviews with the Wachowskis and how they said that the SFX in Reloaded would beat the first Matrix movie. Well, they were blowing smoke up where the sun don't shine. The SFX were nearly all the same from the first movie, minus the Twins. (Who should've gotten more screentime, considering the amount they get in the previews). The fight scenes were way too rehearsed to even be close to believeable. I nearly fell asleep during the Seraph/Neo fight... And the ending, we can't forget that! And how poor it was. Very poor...even Back to the Future 2's ending wasn't that bad.To see a sequel executed on all 10 cylinders, go see X2. That movie expanded on the original and did it with pinache. Reloaded is a drag.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","great sequel, but better prequel (no spoilers)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0702912/?ref_=tt_urv","Netaholik","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1011702/?ref_=tt_urv","15 May 2003","I thoroughly loved The Matrix, and enjoy it more after having seen its first sequel.  The Matrix: Reloaded served as a good sequel, but it serves as more of a prequel to the 3rd (and final?) installment, The Matrix: Revolutions. Obviously, from the time we first saw a teaser trailer for Reloaded, we've known that a 3rd film would be released, and a mere 6-7 months after Reloaded.  Reloaded was chock-full of special effects that actually put The Matrix to shame... or is it that we've seen so many copy-cats of the original in the last few years that ""bullet-time"" seems outdated?  Either way, there are a lot of similar, yet better special effects in Reloaded. Some very intense, mind-boggling fight scenes were included in the movie that are, alone, worth the time spent in watching it.  As for the story line, it continued the saga of Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, and the gang versus the artificially intelligent Agent Smith and his cohorts, but also brings into the game a few new villains and allies.  It's not so much that the villains and allies just popped into existence, as it seems with a lot of sequels, but that they weren't needed to be mentioned in the original, and the way the original was written, some of them were mentioned, just not by name.  It is obvious that either the whole story was designed/written before the first movie, or else the Wachowskis are just really good at making up nonsense that eventually makes sense in a sequel.  Anyway, as I said in the summary, this was a great sequel, but since we were expecting a cliff-hanger to make us go see Revolutions as well, it did have to include a lot of content that leads up to its successor.  All in all, I thought Reloaded was worth my time and money to see, being the Matrixite I feel I am, and I can't wait to see the finale this fall.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I personally found the highway scene the most entertaining, and it's quite impressive the things that were accomplished, cinematographically and choreographically. With far more elaborate and unique characters than the first, it can feel like too much at times. And for the most part, it is. The script and dialogue is often brutally complicated and overlong, especially the Architect scene, which is later summarized beautifully in less than 20 seconds by Keanu. To that point it honestly felt like the writers were trying too hard. And the Zion party scene, good God, it went from tribal drums to a DJ-run dance club and dragged on for far too long. These aside, I particularly enjoyed Monica Bellucci, Hugo Weaving's enhanced personality, and the epic ""ending."" Unfortunately the most annoying thing about this movie was the ignorance of ""non-believers""; Neo can fly and fight hundreds of Agents without breaking a sweat, but still wears raggy clothes and is treated like a peasant. People speak about hopelessness and never acknowledge his existence, let alone his presence in a room. It's really lazy writing and makes me think the first was not premeditated to bear sequels.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Matrix Reloaded did not.  It ended with a To Be Concluded and just left you hanging.

For one, like The Phantom Menace 4 years ago, The Matrix Reloaded has to measure up to very high expectations.  In many people's eyes, it does not, but for me it worked well.It is disjointed in some parts, particularly the dream scenes and the Zion celebration.  And it lacks the mystery element of the first one, an inevitability of sequels.  Still, overall, this is the right continuation of events and character arcs.  Keanu Reeves is a stronger, wiser Neo, and he actually delivers the lines well, something he is not usually known for. Carrie-Anne Moss gives us the softer side of Trinity, although she can still kick her way through any number of enemies.The most interesting and subtle parallel to Star Wars here is the use of love.  Like Anakin in Attack of the Clones, Neo makes a decision that goes against what is expected of him, upsetting the design of things, all because of his love for a woman.  Amidst all the special effects, The Matrix movies, like the Star Wars movies, are humanistic stories, dealing with the imperfections that make humans free.The actions sequences are awe-inspiring.  The car chase in the last act does indeed surpass The French Connection and Ronin before it.  Still, in the end, it is the characters that make this a worthwhile movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was VERY disappointed, if I hadn't seen the first Matrix I would've been totally lost, which proves to me that this 'film' is for kids with PS2's. When I go see a movie I want actors fighting not 3d models. The fight scenes lasted too long and were redundant; why fight something you cannot defeat? Plain stupid, run you fool!

I am still wondering why the new operator family story, why half-naked dancing scene, why new agent, and it turn out that the movice tried to make a non-sci-fi story. I mean, come on, does people really have to understand where the Oracle came from, have to know why Agent Smith become a virus. and more disappointing is the ku-fung action somewhat indolent than original Matrix, it's more 1980s style if you know what those looks like. I'll give 4 to this bad episode, and I wish next Matrix back to track.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's effects style, particularly ""Bullet Time"" has been parodied more times than I can count, from the parody smash Scary Movie to the cultural phenomenum ""The Simpsons"", and from commercials for reasturaunts to the Superbowl.  The fact that so many have made use of their technique just goes to show how strong an impact that it had on society.  The down side of this is this is that now the moves that were fresh, cutting edge, jaw dropping are now obsolete and passé.  The Wachowski Brothers have mentioned this problem in several interviews that this has been one of their main focuses in making ""The Matrix Reloded.  ""How do we top our last film AND separate ourselves from the knock-offs?""  ""The Matrix Reloded"" has done this and more.  I can only describe it as a roller coaster ride that gets progresivly wilder as you go.  I can not recommend strongly enough how much you should see this film.  If you have the opportunity to see it on the Big screen than even better.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Keanu once again showed little emotion, and trinity didn't look nearly as good this time as in the first movie, she slightly looked like an old lady.

I'd heard complaints that in the first hour there's nothing happening. This is pretty much true. But it's not even close to being the reason of this movie not working as well as the first. The problem is the philosophical rubble that just goes on and on and very soon gets irritating. It feels like the directors are bragging with their material.. ""oh, look how smart problems we've managed to write in to the script"". Of course the whole idea of the world being fake is deeply philosophical in itself, but this was just the theme in the first. The first film made it's point by visuals and not including much of it in the actual dialogue, but in Reloaded they for some reason saw that it wasn't enough. Shame. Also most of the comedic moments are flat. The film has it's good qualities too. As expected, the action scenes are terrific. The fight between Neo and the Smiths goes on a bit too long though and the hero himself looks animated in some shots of the scene. The highway chase steals the whole show.. the twins kick ass and the cars flip over like it's poetry. Surprisingly good are also the scenes between Trinity and Neo. Not overly melodramatic, but rather nice. As a film, Reloaded is a three star picture, but the great action ups the stakes. Revolutions? Bring it on.**** / *****","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

DON'T BELIEVE THE CRITICS THAT SAY IT WAS JUST SPECIAL FX WITH NO PLOT AND BAD ACTING.You have to remember it is not a stand alone movie it is part of a trilogy so will have to have seen and understood the first movie to have a chance at understanding this one.THE STORY IS ACTUALLY THE BEST PART although the action and sfx are 2nd to none. It really changes your whole perception on the characters and matrix. You left unsure who is good/bad what happens next...Some of the reviews in the papers here clearly didn't even understand or pay attention to the first movie, one JOURNALIST COULDN'T EVEN GET THE LEAD CHARACTERS NAME RIGHT calling ""Neo"" - ""Nero"" If he understood the movie he would realise that neo is an anagram of ""one"" as he is the one.If you go and see the movie make sure you WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE CREDITS finish as there is the trailer to Matrix 3:Revolutions.The movie is easier to follow if you have played through the game ""enter the matrix"" as there is an HOUR OF EXTRA FOOTAGE that explains a lot of things. The animatrix is also good to watch but only the episode called ""LAST FLIGHT OF THE OSIRIS"" really helps explain the movie.I found that only 2 of the 18 people I went to see the movie with understood it all straight away as it is A LOT DEEPER THAN THE FIRST MOVIE but even if you do not follow the story it's worth seeing just for the action scenes. The car chase is unbelievable and the comedy element at the end of it had the whole audience change from BITING THEIR FINGER NAILS ON THE EDGE OF THEIR SEATS TO LAUGHING THEIR HEADS OFF.If you go to see it don't expect to be eased back into the story line you need to remember the first movie and there has been a gap inbetween the 2 movies of about 6 months so it's NOT A DIRECT CONTINUATION.I'm already dying to see Revolutions...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"6","/10","From One Too Many and More Conspicuously Absent","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6060183/?ref_=tt_urv","Cineanalyst","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1888886/?ref_=tt_urv","4 September 2020","""The Matrix"" (1999) is a singular masterpiece, so I suppose one shouldn't be surprised that the sequels failed to rise to the level of that initial effort. The man-v-machines sci-fi theme remains, but, here, it descends into a freeway car chase reminiscent of something from an installment in ""The Terminator"" franchise. The bullet-time photography returns, and the CGI may even be better four years later, but there's nothing here quite like the ultraviolent shootouts from the first film, while there is more of the superhero flying. It's still darkly-lit cyberpunk, but ""The Matrix Reloaded"" has largely abandoned the neo-noir tropes of the original. There are no ""Alice in Wonderland"" references now (although, as in the Alice books, there are still dreams, plenty of doors, as well as keys and the promise of a clock motif this time around). We've lost that introduction from a dreamworld, and now we have two worlds, real and false, that are stubbornly obvious in their demarcations (until, perhaps, the end). Not even the pretensions to the philosophies of Jean Baudrillard's ""Simulacra and Simulation"" and Plato's Socrates and Cave Allegory are discernible anymore, as the sequel redoubles the biblical allusions for its pseudo-religious prophesying. While reductionist in this sense, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" does follow the pattern of doubling in sequels in other respects.Early on, this multiplication is evident with the former-agent Smith and his doppelgängers. Later, we learn the ""One,"" Neo, may actually be one of many, as especially well staged in the Architect's room full of screens with images of Neo(s). There are the identical, ghostly white, twins who chase the heroes in that freeway sequence. And the film-within-the-film itself is even a sequel, ""The Brides of Dracula"" (1960), as viewed by two programs who are like vampire (or, more so, like werewolves) in that they're only killed by silver bullets. All of this is a common practice of sequels to reflexively nod at the fact that the films themselves (and, indeed, movies in general) are reproductions of an original. I (and others, I'm sure--there's never just one) have talked about this repeatedly before. One of the my favorite examples is one of the first great sequels, ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935), which redoubles everything from characters (two mad doctors, two monsters, two brides, etc.) to the narrative (with a frame story of the author and a bifurcated plot).It's the simpleton earnestness of it all, however, that seems more obtrusive in the sequel, although it was there, too, in the first film. Heck, when the Councillor in Zion (yes, very heavy on the biblical and otherwise religious names) tries to complicate the picture's polemics a smidgen, by talking about humanity's dependence inside and outside the Matrix on machines, Neo shuts him down with his jejune absolutism. Honestly, the Wachowskis tend to seem unambiguous with their pictures' politics and philosophies despite them being typically ambiguous in definition, as perhaps dictated by mainstream movies that demand to not be pinned down to any controversial standpoints (which is to say any actual position beyond, say, that enslaving humanity as batteries is bad). Nevertheless, the true successor to ""The Matrix"" in my mind is their ""V for Vendetta"" (2005), which is explicitly a comic-book movie, but one that is rooted, as with ""The Matrix,"" in prior works and other genres: in that case, ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" and swashbucklers, both of which feed back into the superhero genre. There, too, the politics are ridiculously simplistic, but it does hark back to ""1984,"" the book and film--similar to how ""The Matrix"" echoed Baudillard and Plato, as well as Lewis Carroll and a noir sort of fate. While the party sequence in Zion might be well filmed or that car chase may arguably be fun, along with the repeated martial-arts fight scenes, there's too much missing here from the highly influential, perhaps even revolutionary, first ""Matrix,"" and with nothing substantial, for all its doubling, to replace it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

A lot of martial arts and action sequences are cut too fast nowadays and I'm glad that this film toned down the BGM and flash editing and orchestrated a beautiful ensemble that will be extremely difficult to top in the third film.  I won't get into the story details, because anybody that saw the original film knows that the Matrix is something to be experienced rather than explained.  Aside from the awesome action sequences, the next big highlights include the unique characters additions (I mean everybody just seems to stand out and maintain their own level of intrigue) and how well the depth and size of the locations are captured on film (the ""real"" sewers, freeways and skyscrapers actually give you the feeling of the capacity and distance).Finally I want to say that all the people who love to get up and leave during the credits...you're going to miss the bonus ending.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first hour of this film is utterly boring, the action sequences add nothing new and the dialogue makes George Lucas sound like Shakespeare.To make matters worse we have to wait until November to get the end of the story.  This should not have been a trilogy.  Cut an hour out of this one and stick the third part onto what remains.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Well, after having seen ""Matrix: Reloaded"" I have to say, the story should have ended after part 1.It's not like part 2 was a complete rehash of the first one, but it introduces stupid new aspects and storylines that go nowhere. Questions are raised without being answered and the whole thing makes no sense at all (I'm sure this can be debated over for hours but at the end of the day I think the Wachowskis were trying to be weird, rather than presenting something that can be explained reasonably).I'm surely not the first to state that this movie is way too long. The dancing sequence.... God, I almost fell asleep. The fight scenes... yeah, I'm a guy and I'm usually of the opinion that action's cool but this went too far. Besides, I'm so fed up with martial arts these days.Another flaw for me were the props. How the hell could they put all of the budget into special effects and then shoot the goddamn thing in a studio that makes the movie look like an episode of ""Star Trek""? The ""cool"" coats, leather suits and glasses of Neo, Trinity, Morpheus & co. are so overdone that ""The Matrix"" becomes a parody of itself. In ten years from now people are gonna laugh about this. Come on folks, didn't we learn anything from ""Saturday Night Fever"" or ""Miami Vice""?""Matrix: Reloaded"" is watchable, but I don't think I'm gonna watch it again soon. ""Matrix"" (no. 1) is the only part of the trilogy, that will be remembered as a movie classic.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I felt like i was watching Mortal Kombat 2 all over again. It was like a horrible nightmare. There was tons of action, so much so that it became boring if you could believe that. Lots of pointless action and lots of pointlessness, for example the dance club scene. If i wanted to see people dance i would go to a club myself, not pay 15 bucks to see it in a theatre.There was too much Kung Fu in it. I didn't believe it would be possible but the Matrix ruined something that i thought you'd never get enough of. All the fighting scenes were pointless since you knew who was going to win no matter what. So the whole movie was Neo wasting agents over and over and over again. The special effects were top notch but i don't care how much special effects are in it, it still sucked. Star wars episode 2 was all special effects but that didn't stop that ship from sinking and it certainly didn't stop this one. The ending was one of the worst i had ever seen in a sequel. The might as well have ended it after the opening credits because the movie was pointless.The entire time i was watching it, I was waiting for the movie to come out of its sleepy boring state and wake up to the real story, the real point but it never did. It was as if i was watching a 2 and a half hour long trailer.Well the Matrix did succeed however. It succeeded by suckering me into watching it and wasting my money.And it will continue to do so to others for months to come.The matrix is a very huge, very complex sucking machine that will have repercussions echoing through time, disappointing complex matrices of people worldwide. And just think, there's another batch of humans, paying to be blown away by disappointment right now as you read this.0 out of 10","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I thought that the action was stellar, but not as creative or unique as it in the first one when it still had that mind-bending newness.  The story however is as compelling and mind blowing as the first Matrix.  Wrestling with the concepts of God-given free will and the power of choice, while continuing to juxtapose a backbone of both Eastern and Western mythology and religion.  Coupled with the roles of fate and destiny as each person finds their role in life, this movie will have you coming back half a dozen times while you try to work out its subtle brilliance.  The Matrix Reloaded is as powerful, philosophical, and visually stunning as the first, and the final installment of the series should be a treat.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And just like the Matrix copy cats must be compared to the original, so must the reload.If it weren't for the fact that people could walk away from this with a completely different interpretation, I'd give it a much higher ranking.  So there are the problems with this film.  Lack of originality and lack of clarity in the story.For those unsure whether they want to spend over 2 hours in the theater, you can get by with watching the final hour without missing anything significant.  Monica Bellucci provides far more sex to her character and the movie than the scenes between Neo and Trinity.As to the soundtrack/score, it has some very impressive moments.  For a movie that you'd expect to cause you to jump out of your seat at least once because of surround sound FX, there is nothing.  The visual FX, on the other hand, live up to the hype.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'm not giving an overview although I've heard complaints that the story takes a dive and it's too hard to figure out what's going on. If you pay attention, you will understand everything. I've only seen it once and there's not one part that I question--I know I'm gloating, get over it. I think a lot of people went in with too high of expectations--I just went looking for great special effects and a neat story and that's exactly what I got. Yes, the fight scenes are longer and more drawn out than they probably needed to be, but I was never bored watching them. The chase scene itself is ridiculously long-winded, but nevertheless it kept a smile on my face the entire time. Of course, negative strikes could include lack of character development, plot holes, blah blah blah, who cares? Actually, if you review the movie there are not ANY plot holes--everything is carefully answered. And cliffhanger ending? Not really, but you can be rest assured that I will be viewing REVOLUTIONS.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In this movie Neo keeps having these dreams about 'Trinity' being killed by agents.'Trinity' is again played by the beautiful Carrie Anne Moss.She is again brilliant in The Matrix Reloaded just as she was in the original.She is tougher than all the guys ;)'Morphues' is again played by Laurence Fishburne.He is again the wise and brave character that he was in the first movie.Morpheus even has his own sword in this movie.Agent Smith is again played by Hugo Weaving.He is a machine in disguise as a human but ......... in this movie there is more than just 1 Agent Smith.He can transform others into a clone of himself.
Just 1 question though, what happened to 'Tank' the operator ??????
Anyways I would recomend this film to everyone in the world.It is just amazing.10/10 for me","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

After a movie as inspired and as original as ""The Matrix"", the minimum expected was something equivalent, especially given that we have back the entire original team, including the directors, who also sign the script.What we have in this film is the beginning of the ultimate conflict between machines and human beings. The film continues to bet on the style created earlier, and it continues to look cool, and trying to keep it up most of the time. The fight scenes have become even more impressive and stylized. The special effects are fantastic, all the actors' work is good despite being as impersonal and cold as in the first film. The actors do the best they can, but they don't always achieve the brilliance of the first film. There's just something missing. In addition, the film has moments that shouldn't be there: the sex scene was expendable, and I hated that kind of rave, with little clothes and more like the beginning of a gigantic orgy. Yes, in fact they are about to start a gigantic battle that decides whether everyone lives or dies ... and what they want to do is to be semi-naked and rub their bodies together, to the sound of an electronic beat. There's logic! So much logic as the strange and inexplicable ability acquired by the villainous agent to copy himself to exhaustion.The film maintains the good production values of its predecessor, but is much weaker in script and storytelling. This ultimately harms it greatly.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

When I first saw it, it took me by complete surprise (c'mon, it's a Keanu Reeves movie), and it provided one of my more enjoyable movie-going experiences in 1999.  Like all great science fiction, it brought a new, terrifying, and wildly believable world to life.  All I could say was ""wow"". When I heard that this was only the first of a trilogy of Matrix movies, I had more than a little trepidation. How could the Wachowskis jump-start the second while improving upon the original? Well, the answer is, they couldn't. The second installment, The Matrix Reloaded, doesn't hold a candle to the original. But all of the principals from the first are present; what went wrong? Well it's the Star Wars Syndrome. But at least George Lucas gave us three great movies before stumbling, the Wachowski's mustered only one. But the mistakes committed by Lucas and the Wachowskis are very similar; infusions of moralizing, diminuation and sanitizing of the drama and tragedy, dumbing down the characters, etc, etc. The Matrix Reloaded is not a bad movie, just a disappointing one.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Not only did it revolutionize the way we make films, but it opened discussion on a lot of topics people feel quite conflicted about these days.  This movie is good, but not as good. The Philosophy is more interesting, delving deeply into causality, and the nature of determinism, but the graphics are nothing new.  I remember four years ago when The Matrix came out- it was not only the first science fiction film to stir discussion since 2001: a Space Odyssey, but it had incredible graphics.  This film has the same graphics.  Nothing new. Nothing better.  Unlike Two Towers which was an obvious improvement over Fellowship in most every way (other than points of plot, which second parts in trilogies rarely have developed versions of), the Matrix reloaded is an improvement only in ideology.  The extended fight scenes were actually the most uninteresting parts of the film.  8/10 for causality, and Nietzsche-esque questioning of the  dogma,  5/10 in the action department. Didn't make me go ""woa"", just ""okay...cool...""","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's an interesting story but don't expect a deep and heavy plot. Do expect deep and heavy thinking at times, since the philosophy lessons in the movie definately carry weight.I enjoyed the movie as it definitely fulfilled rule #1 of any movie: it was entertaining. There is nothing in the movie to make a person who didn't like the first one come see this one. It has the same feel and sound as the first. My projection for domestic ticket sales? I think about $325 million. The ""R"" rating (deserved) will keep it under $400.As with the last movie, the character I most enjoyed of their screen time was the Oracle. Gloria Foster brings such a humorous twist to a very serious character. It's sad she died before the filming of the 3rd one was complete. She will be missed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Not surprisingly it does what all middle films do in a trilogy it raises the stakes and leaves you hanging at the end of the film.  Much like Empire Strikes Back in the Star Wars Trilogy, the Matrix Reloaded also changes the perceptions of the film series.  Although the change here is far less dramatic.I think what weakens the film was all the time they spend in Zion in the first half of the film.  It wasn't really necessary to spend 5 minutes in a montage of rave dancing and love making.  Nor was it necessary for the passionate speech to the masses given by Morpheus.  I prefer the more subtle and mysterious manners that the character displays while he is in the Matrix world.  Outside of the drawn out love scene the love story between the Neo and Trinity works well and provides a nice reversal of roles from the first film.  This time out Neo knows whats going to happen and has to save Trinity.   The film is good but it is much like all the other sequels that are out there right now.  It is yet another middle film in yet another trilogy.  We all come to expect some twist in the middle film now and you do get it here. Trilogies, over all are becoming tiresome and in a sense a genre all to themselves.  That said Matrix Reloaded is a worthy entry into the franchise and will most likely will further immortalize the Wachowski brothers, the Matrix creators, due to the large success that the film is going to be.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And I nearly did, there was lots of boring yet interesting talk in the movie. However...The action scenes made up for way more of the talking... the fight scenes were the best i've ever seen, and as an avid movie goer, that says alot.  And then the movie approached the car chase, which lasted about 30 minutes long.  That was by far the greatest car chase in any movie...EVER...PERIOD!!! Nothing will ever come close to that. The car chase was better than half the full length movies i've ever seen. I am only 15, but I will see this movie at least 10 times.

The sequel, however, has none of the same qualities, and nothing enjoyable except for the ending credits.  Belabored monologues, overkill action scenes, and the lack of a new thought for the first 3/4 of the flick, are all reasons to stay home and wait for Titanic 2: The Reckoning.  Rave scene, porno sex, and matrix-induced orgasms are reason enough to skip Reloaded. Specifics: the keymaker- this guy got told to put down the mop and get on the set.  The Frenchman- I can't remember if this actually happened or not. Morpheus' speech- This guy ain't no Vince Lumbardi, monotone shouting was so late 80's.

The conversation is straight to the point, clever, and chatty, without trying to be too precocious. And the famous freeway scene is very impressive.What I did not like about the story were the cliffhanger ending, the all-too arty and overused slow-motion-in-the-middle-of-the-scene effects, and the less-than-subtle references to Greek mythology, Eastern mysticism and pseudo-theology/psychology. (Yeah I know a lot of geeks are really into that stuff, but it doesn't turn me on that much).I have to say I'm very cautious about stories with an ultra-dark mystical occultish horror tone, which is why I've avoided movies like THE EXORCIST, the OMEN series, ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE SIXTH SENSE. No, I am ***not*** a complete puritanical wowser killjoy, and I've got nothing against people who are into that sort of thing.

While there is some philosophy in this movie on the nature of the relationship between man and machine and on the questions of fate and choice, the movie feels like a soap opera or some cheap serial or miniseries from tv. There were some parts that were just plain stupid. The action sequences ran on way too long. Having multiple copies of Agent Smith seemed laughable. The Albino ghosts were ridiculous. Instead of the actions scenes being amazing and state of the art as in the first film, they, to me at least, seemed tiresome and laughable; I guess because the Matrix action sequences have been copied or spoofed so many times now. And the whole storyline with Trinity and Neo and Niobe and Morpheus seemed like some soap opera. And what was with the rave party at Zion? Stupid. And the ending!

The first half hour is a waste of time and after that it had its bad moments. The special effects were excellent and the plot was impressive, however the sound editing was awful.
This isn't as good as the first film, it has none of the style and freshness of the original, I think peoples expectations were far too high, 'this is a sequel after all'.There were some terrible scenes though; the sex scene (why?), the woman's crotch scene (were they trying to rob the film of its taste and subtly)On a high note many of the scenes were cool, the architect, the smith fight, highway pursuit and dream sequences. And this can carry the film quite a way.The end unlike the first matrix film made sense but also unlike the first matrix film was a huge anti climax, who really cares about the man smith has taken over.The trailer for the matrix revolutions look very good, I just hope the brothers learn from their mistakes this time around and present a finale worthy of a second viewing7/10 (I think terminator 3 might be better, have you seen the new trailer, WOW!!!)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Directed by Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski. I just saw `The Matrix Reloaded' today on its opening day. Ever since the `The Matrix' came out in 1999, fans have eagerly waited for this sequel and the upcoming `The Matrix Revolutions'. I waited several minutes in rainy cold weather to buy my ticket, and while waiting, I was constantly thinking that this better be worth it. It was worth it, but barely.Three good things about `The Matrix Reloaded': One, the special effects are great. There is this highway chase scene that is visually stunning. Two, it is appealingly stylish in a very artistic way. Three, it doesn't suffer from the strong beginning but weak ending' syndrome, it gets better as the story progresses, however, the ending is a cliff hanger that shocks the viewer.Three terrible things about `The Matrix Reloaded': One, the trite annoying dialogue that plagued the first movie is here as well. Two, there are several new characters that are not well introduced, and therefore, become distractions that add little to the movie, however, a couple of these characters are visually welcoming diversions. Three, the fight scenes get a bit tedious.Like the first Matrix movie, the special effects and fight scenes dominate, and the story is lacking in substance, but I gave it a high rating anyways for its entertainment value.  I also found myself laughing several times, there is some subtle humor thrown in.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It doesn't even really have a beginning or an end. It's just the middle part the story. It's that grey area where we're waiting for the big finale, but we already know there isn't anything left to develop anymore because it was already explained in the first film. So Reloaded builds onto the matrix mythos. It explains some of the intricacies of the matrix that we didn't get to see in the first film. It explains things like why there are ghosts in the matrix and it builds a lot on the different programs that perform all the many tasks in making the matrix look and feel real. It isn't as heart poundingly exciting as the first one, but when it's over you'll just say ""Wow"" and be speechless.The action sequences are stunning. They'll blow you away. The car chase and the burly brawl, in which Neo fights 100 Agent Smiths, are just way way cool. The computer effects have taken a step up since the first movie. Before I saw that, I didn't think it was possible.Overall I didn't think this was the greatest movie ever made. I didn't think it was as good as the first Matrix. It isn't even a full movie, only a part of one. Alone, that would be horrible. But it isn't alone. Many movies have a whole lot of potential that they just don't live up to. That's what makes a movie a bad movie. This however is one of the rare cases where the movie met or maybe even passed it's potential. But because of the nature of being ""the middle part"" it's potential just wasn't that high to start with. So in short, it's not the best movie I've seen, but it couldn't have been better. I give it a 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was a great movie which would probably stand up brilliantly in years to come... were it not for this sequel, which dilutes the quality of the franchise [hate that word]. Too busy, too long, too fragmented. And much of the dialogue is of the type which you spend your time avoiding  at parties.I can recall almost every scene from the first movie, and yet immediately after seeing Reloaded I had already forgotten half of it.  I feel that a few important characters from the original have been betrayed, as well as some concepts, so that if you go back and watch the first movie again it will seem more hollow and pointless.BTW: I'm surprised it doesn't bug more people that so many innocents get killed in both movies... how can our heroes be so casual about slaughtering of captive minds?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The ""Reloaded"" and ""Revolusions"" should be one movie. I haven't seen the third installation, but I can oly imagine that if it has as much fat as the second did, it's mandatory. 2. The reason the first Matrix was so wonderful is that it didn't spell every single thing out and it made us care about it's hero and whether he was going to succeed or not. In this one, I didn't care about Zion. Honestly, the movie over sold it to the point that it was all for not. We all know evil will fail so get to it already. Talking about it over and over again doesn't make me care. Morpheus was right about Neo, why wouldn't he be right about this. No suspence. As far as Neo. We know that he can do everything. We now know he can overcome. The only thing interesting in this is how will he overcome all those Agent Smiths? Cutting all the fat from the second so that everything doesn't go on and on about how important Zion is.....we get it!...and making it one movie would have kept it's reputation up as a smart science fiction. Too much and not enough but still a worthy effort.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is obvious that a really kick ass, hour-long movie is in this over 2 hour spectacle. Unfortunately the makers of this movie realized that gushing fans would be more than happy to shell out their eight bucks twice to see this movie and the quick arriving sequel in November.Almost every scene in Zion was a waste of time. The extended dance sequence reminded me of a Coors Light commercial, and really seemed out of place here. The endless repetitions of the odd philosophy lessons not only got old, they got annoying.I enjoyed the Greek myth allusions, and can see many ways they can wrap up this movie trilogy in fine fashion. But as a stand-alone movie, The Matrix: Reloaded, is mediocre at best, and horror of horrors, boring and bad at worst. People saying, ""You need to judge this movie, based on how good the next one is."" are just making excuses for the poor quality of THIS movie.

Reloaded' is not great at all. Some scenes are hilarious by their triviality: - The Karate ones are far beyond the Chinese movies (that only a fan of this kind of movies could tolerate), even though technically better-made - The `philosophical discourse' is rather ridiculous. If `The Matrix' was implied by post-modern criticism on Media (ref. Baudrillard), the speeches on causality, prophecy, destiny, and so on in `Reloaded' are rather a cheap blah-blah-blah - Somehow it reminded me of many other movies: Independence Day (Morpheus at the Temple and the US President at the military base), Aliens (Zion Defensive System vs. killing the Alien Queen); Doctor Quinn - The medicine woman (The bullet extraction and the brain surgery the woman made in the 19th century in the middle of nowhere), Star Wars (POD Race and the highway) - The `vision of Matrix' made by the green ASCII characters is too funny to take it! And the Oracle body-guard, what to say, has shiny yellow characters!!! - Even the music repeats from the first in the series! (at least during some scenes) - In the scene against the Smiths one can see that the guy is NOT Keanu Reeves! (Of course it's not him! But a better make-up of the stunt was required!) - The Superman thing is incredible! They could've thought of something better! - No mystery! No thrill, only waiting for the end! - Trinity's jealousy was out of nothing, but ridiculous.I am sorry to have so many negative comments. I was a fun of `The Matrix' (I watched it more than 35 times, I have the videotape and the DVD, whatever else materials regarding it, even 2 DIVx versions on CD's). I watched Reloaded a couple of times; to be sure I see a sequel of that masterpiece instead of some naive follow-up. I am sad of concluding that the movie is worse than any pessimistic expectation. Besides the charm of the plot, the talent of the actors, it is only a Karate movie, with Sci-Fi in it, and FX. Lots of FX. Unfortunately, no one can be told what `The revolutions' will bring to us, but I have all my hopes in it, in order to repair the shameful mistake.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

At least, that's the impression you get when watching this latest installment in the franchise. See, what I really liked about the first film was that not only did it have some amazing action sequences, more importantly, it also had a great and wholly original script, offering a very intriguing world vision. ""The Matrix Reloaded"", however, fails to deliver equally on both fronts. Particular attention seems to have been paid to perfecting the visual aspects of the film -- and the results are impressive, I have to say. It just doesn't cut it. It cannot hide the fact that the basis of this film is a... well, pretty weak script. I definitely would have liked to see much more emphasis being placed on story, while cutting back on some of the action. That would have made for a much more engaging film -- catering to the MINDS of people, as well as to the EYES.Rather than joining company with films like ""Crouching Tiger..."" and ""Minority Report"", this Matrix enters the ""Blade""-category.Disappointing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The cyber-thriller of the year is in many aspects more overwhelming on the senses and the mind than its prequel.  The special effects were not the same old matrix repeated with a different backdrop.  If the original Matrix changed the way special effects are done then part 2 took it to a point above and beyond making the original seem outdated.The plot is full of quirkiness and erotitech.  The characters are mysterious and eerie in a way rivaling those of David Lynch.  A few scenes make Playboy magazine seem a Childs book in the erotic dimension that the Wachowski brothers brought to this film.  The acting, which is a slightly flawed, is only good, yet it's not noticeable in the midst of all the heart stopping action.Watching this movie brought me back to the feeling I had as a child watching the original Star Wars films.  It has what the later installments of the mentioned are missing.  Dirty gritty mind bending action, fashionable sex appeal, eerie characters, and spiritual theme.

There's apparently no need to bother with what appear to be major plot holes (such as whether Neo, played by Keanu Reeves, whose woodenness makes him weirdly perfect for the lead, is human or not--everyone keeps reminding him he is, even though he can fly) or characterization (the actors either under- or overact and some are caricaturized--most notably Lambert Wilson as the campy Frenchman Merovingian--to the point of embarrassment). But what the Wachowski Brothers do well, they do exceedingly well: those martial arts sequences (choreographed once again by the legendary Woo-ping Yuen) and the climactic fourteen minute freeway chase are thrilling in their carefully analyzed revisiting of shopworn action scenes; they don't know when to quit, but for some reason, it's impossible to not be fascinated. (Note: this film was viewed in the IMAX format and it's a wonderful choice for such an elaborate production. But the seemingly high-definition format also points to the struggle makeup artists will have to deal with in the future: every zit and facial imperfection is highlighted for the entire world to see and if I were Laurence Fishburne, I'd have that thing above my forehead checked out.)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Anyone else just isn't a real Matrix fan but has been upset to the fact that there has been a ton of hype and expectation building on this film.  That is really unfair considering the fact that these are just two guys trying to make great action movies!  If you take a good long look at the movie, you will see that they have succeeded!  The sequel has taken the original Matrix and surpassed by a thousand times, with more elaborate fight scenes and set pieces.  Did anyone notice how cool Zion looked?  Did anyone notice that the freeway chase and Burly Brawl(100 Agents vs. Neo)were the most audaciously conceived, thrillingly executed action scenes ever made!?  Did anyone else see the complexity and depth of what the Architect, Oracle, and Agent Smith were saying? NO, because they were spending too much time listening to all the hype and expectation building up on it that they were expecting the greatest film of all time.

Visually, it was astonishing, introducing the new visual effect technique of Bullettime. The film became a box-office success making around $27 million in its opening weekend, and going on to become one of 1999s biggest box-office smash hits worldwide. But that wasn't the end. It can easily be argued that `The Matrix' revolutionized DVD sales in that it was a top seller for a long period of time. In fact, people were buying DVD players just to have the movie. And so now, at long last, the story continues in one of two films to be released this year, `The Matrix Reloaded,' and indeed, it is reloaded. This film is a lot bigger than it's predecessor and its visual effects are in a word, striking. However, it doesn't feel as remarkable as the first film. But that's hardly saying that it is a let down. On the contrary, `The Matrix Reloaded' is a noteworthy sequel. 	Keanu Reeves (`Speed') returns as the chief character, Neo, the one human who is prophesied to lead all humans against the machines that control everyone in a virtual world known as the matrix. Since we left `The Matrix,' time has passed, and various characters that were a part of Morpheouse's (Larence Fishburne) ship have died (the explained reason for the absence of the character Tank, played by Marcus Chong.) As such, there are new members as part of the crew, and their situation grows darker as war is approaching between the freed minds of the underground city, Zion, and against the machines that control the surface of the earth. As war approaches, Neo is confronted with the notion of loosing his love, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), to the war. Ultimately, he must make decisions that could not only affect his future with Trinity, but decisions that could change the very fate of every living human in world, be they freed or not. It was guaranteed that visually this sequel would be superior to the first film. In many ways, it is. Some of the effects seem to look like that of a computer game, but then again, they are supposed to because that's exactly what the matrix is, a computer generated dream world. Having said that, there are those visual effects shots that just leave the audience blown away!  The first criticism of the film rests in the thought that perhaps its fight scenes were too drawn out and delved into the unnecessary. There are several amazing fight scenes between Neo and agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who has found a way to copy himself. Hence, there are many upon many agent Smiths throughout the film. It seems that the directors, Andy and Larry Wachowski, wanted to wow their audience. They undoubtedly did so, but it was a little over the top. A second complaint would rest in the idea that the scope of the film is enormous. In `The Matrix,' we are presented the fact that a city exists that is the last human city buried deep underground near the earth's core, where it is warm-but we never see it. The scope of the first film is far smaller than this one and just presents ideas for the audience to play on. We don't see much beyond the ship that Neo, Morpheous, and Trinity are plugged into the matrix from. What we see of Zion in this film is extraordinary, but at the same time, the anticipation is gone. It becomes less mysterious and intriguing and becomes more of what is reality. The most impressive parts of the film were those with Fishburne playing Morpheous. Fishburne is a tall, broad man and his presence is extraordinarily heroic. Who wouldn't want to be like Morpheous if they were in the matrix? What's more, the character of Morpheous is portrayed more as a monk than as it was in the previous film, making him seem all the more wiser. Monica Belluci, an Italian actress who has been in such films as `Malena,' and `Tears of the Sun,' joins the series as Persephone, a woman who aids Neo, Morpheous, and Trinity. Belluci is quite possibly the most beautiful woman in the whole of modern cinema. Moreover, she is an accomplished actress and her very presence adds a captivating feel to the film. Essentially, `The Matrix' films are exactly like the `Star Wars' and `Lord of the Rings' films in that all three deal with the classic mythological concept of good verses evil. But what separates all three films is their setting and characters. There will be more films that deal in the same genre in years to come that will astound audiences with similar stories. But for now, `The Matrix Reloaded' is a dazzling visual achievement and a great sequel. However, the first film remains to be the best of the series, so far. FYI-stay until the end of the credits and see the teaser trailer for `The Matrix Revolutions,' due out on November 7. ***","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first Matrix film had a conclusion - Neo reached enlightenment and gained freedom from the matrix.  You didn't know exactly how he was to break the matrix down, but you assumed it would happen.But now we have this sequel, and there is to be a third installment, presumably the final one.  It's understandable that the filmmakers want to make a few more bucks, but the sequel isn't as good as the original.The computer graphics continue to be stunning, but nothing is new here, just a continuation of the technique developed before.  The central characters return - Neo (Keanu Reeves), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), and Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne).  Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) also returns but he's more caricature than character this time around.Several new members of the crew and the city of Zion are introduced, but the actors portraying them are not very good and they detract from the main story.  There is also some unnecessary melodrama - a jealous spat between Morpheus and the Zion commander over a woman, a wife angry that her husband spends too much time following Morpheus around.  The romantic angle between Neo and Trinity also takes up much of the movie.The original left some loose ends, but it was better that way.  It dealt with the matrix in allegorical terms, whereas this sequel (and presumably the final chapter) seem determined to define everything for the viewer. Sometimes, it's better left to the imagination.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The original film was one of the best films ever made, and one that didn't necessary needed any sequels. But given the enormous success of ""Matrix"" in cinemas and especially of home media (i had the original VHS as well) and hype for the sequel, the continuation was inevitable. And as far as sequels goes, ""Matrix Reloaded"" is a good one.This film is bigger, more spectacular, has bigger sets and scope then first film. It doesn't make it better by any means, because with more epic scope it didn't captured the magic of the first one. There are less surprises along the way, and the whole plot of the 3rd act seems like far stretched and sometimes even convoluted. But on multiple viewing (i saw this film 5-6 times) and did appreciated it more and more. Last time i watched it was on 4k UHD Blu Ray and its a stunning movie to look at.Overall, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is a good sequel on its own and probably the best one they could come up with. Its bigger, louder, more complex and spectacular then the ""Matrix"", but if you ask me which i prefer more and its always the first one - by far. And given the track record of the movies that these two directors will create in the next 20 years, this film is like ""The Godfather Part II"" - you know what i mean. All in all, this is a good and sometimes very good movie on its own to one of the best films ever made.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I realize that the second movie in a series has some difficulties to begin with. People already know most of the plot so to develop that seems pretty pointless. There is almost no plot development here but I think I can live with that.Comparing this to the first movie seems therefore unfair but what is one to do?Where the first movie was very philosophical this just seems like plain action. Not much thought behind the plot and different realities. Further the action scenes that were so different and new in the first one are still there to some extent but you can sense the computer technology behind the camera (so to speak). At some points it seems like the actors are hanging in string.So what do I think about the concept as a whole? I think it's very uneven, at points it's really good (mostly at the end). Sometimes it's a real drag though and I think it's mostly because of the lengthy fight scenes. It feels like they could be reduced by several minutes to give the movie a more healthy length.Too long Too ordinaryBUT I liked the last few minutes so I'll give it 6/10Movie-Man","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The familiar cast added to the height of the movie, bringing back all of the beloved characters while offering a few new ones. It was nice to finally see Zion and the other people trying to survive. The biggest downfall to the movie, that widely takes away from the fun, is the absolute horrifying CGI. There is ALOT of CGI in the movie and it looks like something out of a video game. Further more there are many fighting scenes that last forever and don't make much sense. First of all, if kicking and punching doesn't hurt the guy, then why are you still doing it ten minutes later? Furthermore, at the beginning of the movie Neo makes the comment ""upgrades"" to the agents, telling us they are better then the last film. But then we have Morpheus stand his ground and fight an agent for quite awhile. How on earth is that even possible, when in part one no normal person could fight an agent, let alone an upgraded one? There were way to many action scenes that lasted a long time, compared to actual talking and storyline, they felt like fillers that were unnecessary for the movie. Overall, an important squeal, but very flawed.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Neo and Trinity are deeply in love now. There is an imminent danger that the machines will soon invade the human safe haven of Zion. The leaders of Zion do not have the same view on the best way to handle the machine invasion of Zion. The story flips between the reality of Zion and the matrix world. Luckily for the citizens of Zion, Neo's powers are now a mix of Dr Strange and Superman.Visually it is spectacular and another great job done. The story telling is a bit harder to follow than first Matrix film. The fight scenes and car chase scenes in Matrix Reloaded are awesome, but become overkill, and I found myself thinking please just finish the scene.Matrix Reloaded is worth watching particularly if you like Sci-Fi or The Matrix concept. However like a lot of films the Matrix Reloaded is not as good as its predecessor The Matrix.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If you're going to pick apart and movie at least make comments that are true.First off, this is NOT a sequel. Like the Two Towers it is a continuation of the story and they did a good job keeping up the quality level of the first.YES, there wasn't the mystery of the first, but how could there be? It's part two of the story. Personally I think they did a good job keeping in mind how people would bash the second. It's the hardest part to make. You think you can do better? You write and direct a movie with this many layers? Not as easy as you think.It is not a perfect movie by any standard. The ""Tribal"" scene, NOT A DAMN RAVE, was too long and unnecessary. Understand it was trying to show the nature of humans being tribal beings. It was NOT some MTV crap video. Like I said it was too much though.Yes some of the fighting was CG, but if you care to listen to the people making the movie, they did that on purpose. This is supposed to be a false reality and they took many of their ideas from Anime, philosophy, religion, etc.The expectations imposed upon this movie were unfair to begin with. Like Episode One (which was a much worse movie than this) nothing could ever live up to that. What's enraging is that it wasn't even the film makers who creaded this hype. It was YOU the viewers. To all those people out there complaining about how boring it talky it is at times and then saying the action was dull? What the hell is wrong with you? Pick one and stick with it.The story was great. And stop complaining about too many unanswered questions. It's half a movie. Did you want them to answer everything and have a third movie with nothing in it?Also, I saw someone post that it wasn't smart and they would wait for T3 to see if it delivered. If that's your idea of a smart movie, you have no business watching the matrix to begin with.In conclusion, if you don't like it for intelligent reasons then I understand, but stupid people bitching have no right. ANswer me this smart ones, what's an anomoly","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I remember seeing a week after it came out, people were leaving the theater. I mean a lot, and the theater was packed! This film was alright, I guess, but they definitely should of left out the Zion dancing part, Neo and Trinity getting it on, and Neo's corny lines.

The sequel is nothing I've expected in terms of story line, intrigue or the gripping suspense that made the first movie so great. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" it's not unusual. It's flat and predictable like any other ""classical"" big-budget action thriller; the magic of the original ""Matrix"" is gone.Obviously, if you're going to the theater just to see the special effects, you won't be dissatisfied; there's a lot of them, and they're impeccably designed and made. But you just can't add another milestone to the science-fiction genre just based on eye candies.The ""problem"" is that the first movie was unique in many ways; the second one does not live to the expectations. If you're waiting for something unusual, ""never made before"" in terms of story line, if you want to shout ""Damn, it was good!"", I think we'll have to wait for the third part. This time, the system has failed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

No better & no worse than the first one. Only negatives are:1) Long fight scenes for no particular reason (though technically brilliant) aren't that exciting. Especially when they are 90% digital effects.
2) Used properly digital effects are a great tool. However letting them dominate a movie (Star Wars: Attack Of The Snores) takes away any sort of edge-of-your-seat excitement and jaw-dropping disbelief that old-style effect movies like Indiana Jones gave us the first time we watched them in a cinema.3) I didn't get the architect. Oh I'm sure the message he had was well meaning and is probably highly important to the context of the storyline, but the movie came to a dead stop for what seemed like a very long time for that particular scene and destroyed the pace. 4) Nice to see that tho they might have lost dominion over the planet they still haven't lost the ability to hold Raves. Why they hold one in the face of almost certain death, I've no idea.First Matrix had some holes as well. Still enjoyed it tho. Even tho this sequel has possibly the greatest car chase piece in the history of motion pictures right now, the good/bad thing about digital effects are that with the time, talent and money something like that isn't really that difficult. Mores the pity. I'm beginning to suffer visual cgi overload and turn to movies with plots, emotion and acting in them.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

First is that i didnt think the first film was as good as the hype sugested and secondly the reviews all said that the storyline was complicated and difficult to understand. After watching the film i was pleasantly suprised. I enjoyed it. It's true that the story is complicated and i didnt understand it for one minute but thats not really important as long as you know who are the good guys and who are the bad bad guys that is enough because the action is fantastic. Im not a lover of martial arts film but this is the best i have seen as regards the fight scenes. You have got to see the bit when the lead guy fights all the Mr Smiths in the courtyard, it is amazing. So if your not sure if to watch the film then i say , do so. Forget about trying to understand the story because you wont. Just enjoy the action. 8 out of 10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Entertaining, but most certainly not brilliant","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0703579/?ref_=tt_urv","cookedw","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0528541/?ref_=tt_urv","16 May 2003","I went into the theater expecting an entertaining film, and I got my wish. However, if you go in expecting something challenging mentally, you will be sorely disappointed.  Hopefully you've seen the first Matrix already, though, so you know better than to expect something witty.On the plus side, the special effects were amazing.  They most certainly improved upon the original style, though there was an awful lot of weird physics that was probably not intentional (unlike the scenes where the characters purposely utilize the properties of the matrix).  The scene with the cloned Smiths was a little silly, but all in all the movie had a number of good fight/action sequences.  The music/sound was very well done, too, with only a tad bit of cheesy trance thrown in for good measure.  Most of it flowed well with the film, and if you ate up the first soundtrack you'll probably be stoked to hear this one as well.  The best thing about the Matrix sequel (and what puts it better, in my mind, than the original) is the way in which they tie everything together in a neat little package, working in both the mysticism and technology of the matrix.Now for the negatives.  The dialogue is the worst dialogue I've heard in a long time.  I think even George Lucas could've written better dialogue, and if you've seen any of the recent Star Wars films, you'd wonder how that was possible until you saw Matrix Reloaded.  Yeah, sure, you can shrug some of it off as Agent Smith being his usual robotic self (since he is a computer program).  And there's even one very, very excellent line in the film (""It's like wiping your ass with silk."").  However, if you look at the lines that came from the ship's operator, you wonder how comic relief became so painful.  When you listen to the romantic crap going on between Neo and Trinity, it should make you genuinely wonder how whoever wrote this isn't stuck writing soap operas.  Hell, even Morpheus' speech isn't all that great, though it's given a very key placement right at the start of the film (though what follows is five minutes of my life I wish I could take back. Seriously, who decided to put a pointless music video in the middle of this movie?).Worst of all, the ending ten minute sequence with the Architect is the most asinine part -- remember that ""neat little package"" I just wrote about? Well, the creators of the Matrix do their damnedest to obfuscate the simplicity of it as much as possible by having the architect use a large number of consecutive words rarely heard in the English language.  They then complicate this further by throwing in as much technological mumbo-jumbo as they can fit.  The reason for this is simple -- to make stupid people think they are watching a smart film.  I was amazed by the number of people who were like ""Yeah, the ending totally messed with my head, man.""  Whatever. Nevermind the fact that all the philosophy that was so shallowly explored in this movie had already been talked about, from literature centuries old to fairly recent films like ""Ghost in the Shell""...what really slays me is that people think this is a deep film.  If it really asks any questions you haven't thought about before, you must not think very much.  And they don't even bother to touch deeply on the issue...instead, the cause/effect and free will/destiny philosophical arguments are used simply as a facade to make people think that the Matrix is more intelligent than your average action flick.  While this may barely be true, it can't stand up intellectually to most dramas even Hollywood puts out.Go for entertainment, and enjoy the stunning visuals and audio to the max by seeing it in the theater.  But please, please, please do not try and tell me there's one shred of intellectual stimulation in the Matrix.  It's all been done before...just read some cyberpunk, watch some anime, and hell, I could even recommend some books from as much as 2000 years ago that offered better insight into the same questions the Matrix Reloaded asked.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The 'scenarist' didn't write a script? please tell me what and the hell a scenarist is? Let's try doing a little research before creating words and jobs. The person who writes the script is called the ""writer"". I know it's a little hard to remember all these ""technical"" terms but let's try. If you have an intelligent review to write, good or bad, then go for it, but don't write some half-ass, non-coherant review. It doesn't help anyone.As for the critics, I think most of them stink too. Ebert seems to be the only one I really agree with most of the time and he gave Reloaded 3 1/2 out of 5 stars, which I think its deserving off, being as it's not a perfect movie. But then again, what is?Now I've probably offended the dump people out there who didn't understand the movie. Here's what Ive been hearing from people who didnt like Reloaded. I'll wait for The Hulk or T3. HAHAHA. those are dumb movies for dumb people.And if you people out there who don't know how Hollywood works, this is NOT a formula Hollywood film.

Efforts to destroy the last city of the free humans have been ramped up just at the moment the resistance seems to be having its greatest impact having freed more people from the Matrix than ever before. There are two ways in which the resistance attempts to deal with the impending threat. The first, posed by Commander Lock, is to have as many ships as possible prepared for battle. The machines will have to be fought off using all the firepower at Zion's disposal. The second, proposed by Morpheus, is to revisit the Oracle in order to discover how The One (aka Neo) should act in order to end the war once and for all. Amidst this, Neo is having bad dreams regarding his partner, Trinity. He has a premonition that she will have to face grave danger and that, at some stage, a fundamental choice will need to be made: to save Zion or to save his true love.The Matrix sequels have something of a rather poor reputation. This is understandable given that they are attempting to follow such a well-made first film, but, judging The Matrix Reloaded on its own merits, it's not a bad movie at all. Its pacing is fairly strong, there are a lot more action set-pieces than in the original film and some of them are pretty impressive. This is especially the case with the freeway scene, which is choreographed to virtual perfection and shows great skill and grandiosity from the film's directors. The characters we grew so attached to from the original are pretty much as we remember them. Morpheus, Trinity and Neo are just as poised and ready for action as ever and they're joined by Link, played by Harold Perrineau, who is a likeable and charismatic presence. Agent Smith is back and is just as dastardly as ever. His new-found ability to self-replicate adds to his threat and provides a fresh challenge for the film's heroes to combat.There are, however, problems. The first is that the sequel has nothing of any real substance to add to the wonderfully mind-bending philosophical implications of the first film. The original made us reflect on the nature of reality and experience. The second attempts to inject a focus on free will. Yet, whereas the philosophical ideas were integral to the film's themes in the original, they never feel as naturally ingrained into the narrative in this film. There is a sense the Wachowskis are aware of this and, as a result, the film relies much more on its action to make an impact. In regards to this, while, as stated earlier, the action is very well delivered at times, at others, there is a heavy reliance on green screen and CGI which makes certain scenes look obviously unnatural. This is a great shame as the visual prowess of the original film was one its major strengths.The film also struggles to manage its narrative strands. This is partly because it is populated with far too many characters this time around with the result being that most of them have an extremely limited impact. Jada Pinkett Smith, as Niobe, is fairly irrelevant throughout and Harry Lennix's Commander Lock is largely forgotten after having a significant presence in the first act. Further to this, the film struggles to balance telling the personal story connected to Neo and Trinity with the wider implications of the machines' attempts to destroy Zion. The latter becomes a virtual afterthought by the time of the film's conclusion. Thus, whereas the first film had a feeling of intimacy with its smaller cast and had a more intricate narrative set-up, Reloaded is bloated and unwieldy in comparison. The failure to live up to the original is compounded by the hackneyed ""to be continued"" ending.So, as a stand-alone film, The Matrix Reloaded is not bad. But comparisons to the original are inevitable and, from that standpoint, the film is almost doomed to disappoint.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Doesn't happen. Instead we get many, many scenes of long, rhetorical dialogue that wants to be deep and meaningful but instead comes across as pompous and boring. This is what happens when filmmakers are given free reign without studio interference. Damned if you do and damned if you don't, I guess.With the machines digging their way down to Zion, Neo, Trinity and Morpheus clash with the Council and various superiors on how to deal with the oncoming assault. You'd think the last thing they have time for is lots of pretentious talking.None of the many, superfluous fight scenes are exciting. They are virtually all about blocking. There is no real impact. Watching people twirl five times sideways after a soft kick to the chest doesn't make up for it. I can't understand how anybody has ever been impressed or entertained by these stupid, impossible physics.Keanu Reeves ain't no actor, but I can deal with it most of the time. However, Carrie-Anne Moss is very easy to look at, and Agent Smith owns every scene he's in. I do appreciate Monica Belluci's translucent dress too.It's an effort to get through this film. I've only watched it twice since it came out in 2003. There's just no reason to go back to it. There are films half the length, with a tenth of the budget, that have more action, and coherence.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

But to be completely fair, the W. Brothers, never intended this to be a stand-alone movie. The movie Reloaded is just a piece of the story. TO understand where the movie comes in and answer many of the questions people have had, you have to do three things.1. Watch all of the Animatrix. I know it was kind of dumb to release them weeks after the movie, but upon viewing them all, you grow to understand many of the things that were not elaborated on in the film.2. Finish the Game - Enter The Matrix. This was released the day of the film. This is where Ghost, Niobe, and some of the other Zion folks were developed in detail. There is footage in the game which was shot with the movie, that ties in directly with the actual film. You see what the Merovagian meant when he said ""tell the fortune teller her time is up"" and you understand better what has happened to Neo at the end of the movie.3. Now go back and watch the Movie. It makes the entire experience so much better.The Brothers always intended the Matrix to be experienced like this and by doing all these things it all makes much more sense. Even people who liked the movie, I recommend you do all these things too, it really helps. I had the privedge of seeing all the Animatrix and beating the game before seeing the film so I know.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If you're going to pick apart the movie at least make an intelligent argument. I understand that there will be some people out there who don't like it and I can understand. Opinions are out own, but too many people are complaining about dumb things in a stupid way.First off, this is NOT a sequel. Like the Two Towers it is a continuation of the story and they did a good job keeping up the quality level of the first. Any calling this a sequel has no idea who film or trilogies work.YES, there wasn't the mystery of the first, but how could there be? It's part two of the story. Personally I think they did a good job keeping in mind how people would bash the second. It's the hardest part to make. You think you can do better? You write and direct a movie with this many layers? Not as easy as you think.It is not a perfect movie by any standard. The ""Tribal"" scene, NOT A DAMN RAVE, was too long and unnecessary. Understand it was trying to show the nature of humans being tribal beings. It was NOT some MTV crap video. Like I said it was too much though.Yes some of the fighting was CG, but if you care to listen to the people making the movie, they did that on purpose. This is supposed to be a false reality and they took many of their ideas from Anime, philosophy, religion, etc.The expectations imposed upon this movie were unfair to begin with. Like Episode One (which was a much worse movie than this) nothing could ever live up to that. What's enraging is that it wasn't even the film makers who creaded this hype. It was YOU the viewers. To all those people out there complaining about how boring it talky it is at times and then saying the action was dull? Pick one and stick with it.The story was great. And stop complaining about too many unanswered questions. It's half a movie. Did you want them to answer everything and have a third movie with nothing in it?Also, posting that it wasn't smart and they would wait for T3 to see if it delivered.

The acclaim that the film's extraordinary visuals generated, however, appeared to blind many to the movie's inherent unoriginality. The grungy-cool aesthetic and cod-philosophy, for example, are de rigeur in the sci-fi genre: while the ""you can be anything you want to"" message and the endless violence were pure Hollywood. The theme of computers turning on their masters dates back to at least '2001', while even the idea of a film where life is a video game seems less than striking when in real life, video games are turned into films! But when two sequels came out, there was a fierce negative reaction. In the absence of a similar visual advance over the first film to that which the first film had been over all preceding movies, the flaws were revealed to all, and both movies were badly slated. In truth, while the original was hardly as ground-breaking as its fans would have you believe, 'The Matrix Reloaded' (film two in the cycle) is not nearly as bad as its critics would make out. It's a highly polished piece of hokum, just as the fist film was, and generally, very entertaining except in the interminable fight scenes (which are spectacular, but sadly as engrossing as watching someone else on a Playstation). The second film in a series of three is always going to be the hardest to make work as a stand-alone entity (which perhaps explains why film three was released so quickly after it); but I think the Wachowski brothers have made a pretty decent fist of it. This is still a stylish movie, and an enjoyable one as well, as long as the original didn't fool you into expecting anything too profound.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But what I saw in cinema was mostly disappointing. The film was directed very badly, the script was structured like a porn film ( neo meets guy, they fight, Trinitiy meets two guys, they fight, neo arrives at oracle, Smith comes, they fight etc) the FX were - apart from a couple of really excellent looking shots - mostly surprisingly bad and the philosophy was all too repetitive.All in all I can't really say this was a good film. It has some of the cheesiest scenes I've seen this year, and I've seen many of them. And the FX in the opening scene from X2 were much more impressive then those from this film.Still I'm looking forward to the third part. The Matrix deserved better than this.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Keanu Reeves has set a new record for himself-he actually goes through an entire movie without saying the word `whoa'. That is what you'll be saying throughout the movie, although the non-extreme scenes will leave you confused and bored.Neo, our hero from The Matrix, is back again, along with Morpheus, Trinity, and the rest of the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar floating through the real world (to understand what I'm saying, check out my Matrix review). This time, he somehow has to save the last human city of Zion before the machines destroy it. Also, he's in love with Trinity. Follow that?Put simply, The Matrix Reloaded is X2 for an older crowd. They're both sequels made just for money from a movie that may have been original and grossed in between $100 and $200 million. They both offer more action, often ridiculous, have more convoluted plots, and include more and unnecessary characters. But it isn't all bad.This is a special FX movie, and you can't expect anything more. There are some great fight scenes, with awesome moves. As filmcritic.com's Christopher Null states, `This is a movie about kicking ass.' And there is a lot of that going on. Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) clones himself, causing Neo to fight thousands of the same person. The opening credits were neat, but were worthless since the only thing it said was `The Matrix Reloaded'.On the flip side, there isn't really any meaning to it all. Characters come and go, like the albino twins who can transport, or that guy who cuts his own hands. Also, many points seemed to be like `Rocky and Bullwinkle', when luck-of-the-draw things happen. Although this movie played out `fate', it just seemed like everything `just happened'. I didn't really like the whole destiny, cause-and-effect thing, it just didn't work.Reeves, as Neo, does his usual one-note `tough-action guy' persona which he's had ever since the Bill and Ted movies. Face it, Keanu, you aren't that good of an actor. Laurence Fishburn, as Morpheus, is good at these types of roles. Carrie-Anne Moss, as Trinity, is one of my favorite actresses, and I've been waiting for her to be nude in a movie since 2000's Memento, and I heard that she was in this movie, but I was misled. Weaving is definitely typecast as Agent Smith.The Wachowski Brothers, the directors and writers, decide to change the many action scenes. Martial arts can be enjoyable and funny (hey, even `I know kung-fu' was funny in the first one), as evidenced in Jackie Chan movies, but here they overdo it. Most of the fight scenes didn't impress me; it was just the same OVER and OVER again. They also looked obvious. It was shot individually-Keanu with one, Hugo in others, and just spliced together. $100+ million budget? Didn't look like it. It's basically a cliché or parody of what the first one was.It all boils down to this: if you loved the first one, you'll love this one. If you liked the first one, you'll think this one is OK.My rating: 6/10Rated R for sci-fi violence and some sexuality.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

MATRIX RELOADED is the wachowski brothers flipped bird to everyone involved. the movie is about what they wanted to do, and it's infatuating to see how they appealingly packaged it with enough action and sex that the marketers should just shut up.not only that, they've already made the final chapter of the trilogy so that no matter what the audience reaction is, the sponsors of the wachowski's won't have a g*ddamn say about what the third movie should be about.
now that's genius.every director wants his vision put out there as integrally as possible. people watch artsy fartsy indie and foreign movies because it's more likely the visions of the makers of those films weren't influenced by hollywoodian bureaucracy. MATRIX RELOADED is such a film, except it's got the money to make the vision come close to what it really is inside the wacky minds of the andy&larry brothers!think FIFTH ELEMENT. luc besson wanted to make that flick since he was 16. it's a 16 year-old wet dream come true! i personally liked LEON better, being a hypocritical artsy fartsy jerk myself, but as far as monsieur luc was concerned, THE PROFESSIONAL was a fundraiser.THE MATRIX was really ""matrix 101: introduction to wachowskian fantasies,"" the rosetta stone to 'RELOADED which is only the first half of the wachoswkis immense vision, and a fundraiser as well. i enjoyed this movie the way i enjoyed JACKASS: THE MOVIE, the way i enjoyed IRREVERSIBLE, the way i enjoyed BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE. with only the first half, of course i don't know where it's heading and what the character development was for and all those details you would wonder about if you stopped halfway into a story. but it's a hell of a better cliffhanging movie than either of the LOTR which can't come to finality 3 hours into the story, twice.even the necessity for the cliffhanger is executed with humor, with the nostalgic dramatic sound effect attached to suspenseful endings. the movie's as charming as it gets. distribution of free dvd copies on the way out of the theater wouldn't hurt to generate wider appreciation of its multi-layered craft.'RELOADED has all the replay value you want: mind-boggling fist-fight choreography, titillating concepts of action, comical use of sound effects, breathtaking cuts of demolition, suspiciously orgylike dance sequences, intricate cinematography, a healthy dosage of existential discourse, and an onslaught of memorable moments.in college terms, MATRIX RELOADED is a 200 level upper elective course. if you were happy feeling at the top of the class in matrix 101, you better get adjusted because it'll most likely be a pass/fail course worldwide.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Instead we are given about a half an hour of exposition. New characters, the city of Zion, grumblings about Morpheus, life with the wife and kids.  I guess the Wachowski's felt it was necessary to flesh out the world that was first introduced in the first Matrix.  I am also sure that part 3 will be all about Zion and the characters we have just met.  So keep it in your back pocket.  Once the action begins, it carries you through most of the movie.  It FELT like the movie began to drag everytime a philosophical discussion began. Being a philosophy nut myself,  I would've been ok with it, except the discussion was drawn out too long and sometimes was somewhat incomprehensible  ""Some things change, some things do not""  (what?).  But I feel confident that I will eventually be able to figure it out watching it again.  So that is what I came out of this movie thinking.  I will probably like it better the second time, now that I have overcome my anticipations and can settle in and accept what the movie has to offer.  Nevertheless, the philosophy could have been simplified and trimmed down to keep the dialogue scenes from dragging as much as they seemed to. So enjoy the terrific special effects, TRY to understand the dialogue, and then watch it again to really comprehend it all.  I give it a 6 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I found it intriguing ( you have to think while you watch this movie)and it also links to its predecessor in clever ways ( the scene in the first movie when the agents first interview  Neo is introduced in a way that suddenly gains a new perspective after having seen this movie).Most of the characters are better fleshed out in this film. Zion may not be entirely original in its look (didn't Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection do this first with their production design?)but it is nevertheless very well executed, and fits the story well.The fighting is tougher and rougher in this film, and the Oracle, Merovingian and Agent Smith are the main focuses of some amusing dry humor, with some additional droll contributions from Neo and the Twins.Contrary to some comments, the pacing is NOT sluggish - the action sequences are well worked into the storyline and the expository moments are well played by the cast, albeit both Trinity and Morpheus's roles are somewhat more subdued this time around. After all, this is a complex and ambitious story and therefore requires some extended dialogue sequences. You are expected, as the audience, to THINK!The action sequences are clearly more ambitious in this film, with less emphasis on the balletic quality of the fights in the first film, and more on making them more exciting and outrageous, and in this regard the film works brilliantlyDon Davis's score is the other outstanding feature of this movie. His score in the first film was pretty good, but this is clearly his best work to date, with certain sequences paying homages to Bond and the Terminator films.A throughly enjoyable and interesting film that in my view, actually met very high expectations when I first saw it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You learn what Neo is really supposed to do, what his choices are, the inevitable end to the Matrix and Zion, what purposes the agents play, what purpose Zion plays, and what purpose the Oracle plays (plus many more).  However, much like Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back, there are new problems and mind games that the main characters must address. I'm not going to lie and say that this was better than the first, or that it is worse.  It stands on its own in a way.  If you did not see the first Matrix you will be lost in this one, like wise, if you do not see Reloaded, you will not understand the next Matrix.  The first lets you know what Neo must do and the last will show him doing it, but if you miss what happened in between, you will be missing many big concepts about Neo that were not presented in the first. This is much the sense for movies series like Star Wars and Back to the Future. The second movie in many respects is not as good as the first or third, especially in the case of Star Wars.  However, Empire is great.  Just like this.  I guess what it all boils down to is this: If you were/are a fan of the first, you should see this movie.  You may get bored or feel the special effects are a little overdone compared to the first, but if you watch this one on its own (i.e., don't compare to the first Matrix) you will see just as great a story this one is, with all new concepts that tangle up your whole concept of what the Matrix is and who Neo is. I give it two thumbs up, but I am not the biggest Matrix fan, although I am a pretty big fan.  I just had to write this because I was getting flack from my friends who did not like it because it was slower than the first, but I said: The first was all new concepts, so of course everything is going to seem faster than any sequel after it, since you will have at least an idea of what could or is going to come in later Matrix's.  Heck, my girlfriend hated the first Matrix, she thought it was boring and slow with overproduced fight scenes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The action sequences expected for The Matrix are fulfilled but at mostly a speed slower and longer than my expectations. I wanted to hit fast forward during the film to solve this.  The story, while at times compelling, does little to endear us to the main characters fighting for freedom. In fact, Neo and others seem downright two dimensional when they encounter the decidedly more vivid enemy. (The actor from the restaurant was amazing!)  Finally, I felt the writing was too geeky and dependent on the cult of The Matrix.

Most stories have already been told and retold and in this respect the Matrix Reloaded, in its basic plotline, is no exception. The idea of machines taking over humanity has been explored intensely in films throughout the last thirty years (i.e. Colossus: The Forbidden Project, Terminator, Terminator 2, Virtuosity, and Artificial Intelligence to name just a few).However The Matrix Reloaded, sequel to the original blockbuster hit The Matrix, transcends the trap of most high tech futuristic films and sequels with its powerful combination of suspense, martial arts action, special effects, philosophical leanings and yes, a few new plot-twists. The small group of humans, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Trinity (Carrie Anne Moss) and now Neo (Keanu Reeves) who penetrated the Matrix and freed themselves of its eerie and often confusing control, have now managed to free thousands of people and are preparing for yet another much larger and potentially cataclysmic confrontation. While much of the film's focus is on the visual artistry of fast action martial arts showdown sequences between these rebels and the agents of the Matrix, the film's underlying theme is never lost with the constant intercutting of its non-action plot-driven dialogue on not just how to understand and defeat the Matrix, but broader more fundamental questions with regard to human trust and human control. In fact, the film repeatedly dangles these questions just out of reach of the protagonists, much to their bewilderment and consternation.As Neo, the young naïve yet gifted one with seemingly limitless physical control, Keanu Reeves is once again well within his limited acting range. He is balanced beautifully by Carrie Ann Moss, whose Trinity provides the spark in their relationship and Laurence Fishburne, who as the faithful Morpheus summons his considerable talents to play a role which in lesser hands would fall into the abyss. Rounding out the cast are a myriad of colorful performances, notably Harold Perrineu as Link, Hugo Weaving as agent Smith, Gloria Foster as the Oracle, and French actor Lambert Wilson as Merovingian.The Matrix Reloaded is not for those who require deeper meaning to be told in strictly conventional ways. It is futuristic sci-fi fantasy in its highest form; problematic, probing, and highly entertaining to watch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie I've been salivating about for the past 4 months and I got to see it last night at a 10pm pre-screening. Unfortunately, it just didn't do what the first one did.  I'm not saying Reloaded is a bad movie by any means, it just doesn't create the sense of awe that the '99 film did. There are a few reasons for this:1.) Excessive use of CGI characters during fight sequences 2.) The proliferation of reality bending fight sequences in other films since 1999 3.) Keanu Reeves' acting (You know I'm right) 4.) The storyline is well known, and they just don't do enough to further new plot directions during the majority of the film.However . . .The visuals in this film are so damn good it makes your head pop.  I have NEVER seen anything like this before and I'm a little frightened about what the W Brothers came up with for ""Revolutions.""  Also, without giving too much away, the last 45 minutes will throw you for such a loop that you won't be able to get out of your head.

It suffers from a poor story, gaping plot holes, too many directing styles, and too many conflicting cinematography styles. The acting wasn't all that great either.The special effects are cool, but are at some points overdone, to the point where you have one big CG cluster romp on the the screen. There is some really poor directing, most notably the cheesy ""action-zoom"" as I call it. There were so many units and directors for those units that the direction has no.... direction... to it. The movie does not have the same cinematography style that the first did, instead it looks like your average action movie, whereas the first had a dirty, green tint to it that really added to the experience.One part I liked, much like in Die Another Day, and as opposed to Attack of the Clones, is the length of the battles. In M:R and DAD, the fighting seemed to go on for just the right amount of time to be satisfying, whereas AotC the final battle would have been a masterpiece had it been a few minutes longer.6/10...","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Matrix became a hit because it was a great action film, but also because it had a great plot and deep message about philosophy and reality (I personally recommend reading 1984 by George Orwell to get an idea about it). The film brought extra fame to Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishborne and Hugo Weaving, all staring in excellent films and the Wachowskis could could any project they wanted. The Wachowskis claimed that the Matrix was always meant to be a trilogy, and after the success of first film, shot The Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions back-to-back, the first time I think it ever been done.Set six months after the first film, the machines were preparing for the invasion of the last human city, Zion, by drilling through the Earth. The commanders of the city are obviously worried about the upcoming battle and plan to have every ship available to fight. But some elements of the human population, mainly people who have been from the Matrix think that humanity's only hope comes from destroy the Matrix, freeing the trapped human and prevent the machines from having a power source. This now seems possible with Neo (Keanu Reeves) being the one. To do this Neo, Morpheus (Laurence Fishbourne) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) need to free the Keymarker (Randall Duk Kim) from the exiles, powerful rogue programs that have gone into hiding from the Agents. The Keymarker is the only ally available to the humans who can give them access to the source of the Matrix and thereby the heart of the machines' program. The humans also have to battle a reborn Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who is even more powerful then before, with the ability to make copies of himself. The humans has to battle with the agents themselves. But Neo is also suffering, having nightmares of Trinity being killed. He doesn't want her involved in the battle in case she is killed.The best thing about the Matrix Reloaded is the action scenes, some of the best ever filmed, with excellent martial arts sequence. Particular fights of note are the fight between Neo and Seraph (Collin Chou), the fight between Neo and the Smiths, Neo and the exiles and the Freeway sequence. But that is the only really go thing about the Matrix Reloaded. The plot is confusing and all over the place; even with the philosophical message in the Matrix, it was still pretty easy to follow. They are too many sub-plots and many are left unsolved. There is no focus and a Matrix sequel should have been so much more. The philosophical message of the film is more forced in this film, and it's not easy to believe the message compared to the first film. The message is mostly about fate and choice and the fact machines and humans need each other. I can imagine pretentious people saying I understand this and that means I'm cleaver. You're not, you just think you are clever. The dialogue is at times weak, I excepted better from the film. Also Keanu Reeves shows his talent of being like a tree. At least Fishboure and Weaving are still good.The Matrix Reloaded is not a good film, but the action scene are worthy, just ignore the lack of plot. Avoid The Matrix Revolutions, it is a massive let down.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I found two things to be true. It answers questions from the original movie, but also poses questions of it's own. My greatest fear before I saw this movie was that it would be a straight forward action movie, the basic plot lines already drawn. I was wrong. If you don't like to think, turn your mind off when you enter the theater. Enjoy the eye candy. But if you enjoy something like a good plot, prepare to have your mind expanded.

I disagree. The plot is as straightforward as it was in the first movie--plowing straight ahead--but since most of the truly thought-provoking battle takes place on a philosophical level, it's not hard to see why it would go over most viewers' heads. You can watch the Matrix movies on two levels: the action choreography and the raging philosophical debates about the nature of existence. The original movie set us up with some hard-to-follow content on both counts, and my biggest fear was that Reloaded would disappoint on the second. It did not; I loved the continual raging battle between predestination and free will in it, and the layers of questions-within-questions. Reloaded succeeded, for the most part, though it did not surprise. Quibbles: they should have axed the Morpheus-oration scene, and the Morpheus monologue in the finale was a bit heavy-handed as well. I commend Fishburne for dragging heroically along under the weight of such dialogue. I was somewhat disappointed with the obvious computer-generated Neos that showed up periodically in the fight scenes. I couldn't help but wonder why Neo hung around to fight hand-to-hand anymore, but then we're led to believe that Neo still doesn't seem to realize all that he is capable of doing. The first mention of the ""Keymaker"" made me wonder when we'd be picking up the ""Gatekeeper,"" and (to borrow from a hilarious review on AICN), the party at the beginning really did look like the Pottery Barn had a rave on the Planet of the Gay Apes. We're battling to save this pathetic remnant of humanity? :) There were a great many wonderful moments in the film though, in humor and action choreography and the occasional line of dialogue. I was getting annoyed with the number of flipped cars (why bother after the first one or two?), and the (now-tired, and in this case, somewhat over-used) device of pausing and doing 180-camera-turns in the middle of action sequences. What took your breath away in the first movie does not have the same effect in Reloaded. I thought the ""trade you a kiss for the Keymaker"" scene was a complete waste. The least they could have done was cause some bad thing to happen because of the kiss...but no, it was just so this one small character could irk Trinity. (Unless the woman's situation is supposed to be a possible future fate for Trinity...but still. It was the only completely and truly lame idea in the entire movie.) I had expected the ending of this movie since I walked out of the theatre after the first one, but it was gratifying to finally see it. In all, a wild ride that leaves you exhausted. Not as clean or as ground-breaking as the original, but certainly worth taking the time to think about and enjoy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They were right. And because it was so fantastic everyone wanted more. But the brothers Wachowski weren't too keen on making a sequel, let alone two, because how could they surpass the first Matrix movie. But hey, they've given you what you want : you wanted more of the same, you get more of the same, so stop bitching that the Matrix Reloaded is just more of the same, without the effect the first one had. It's impossible do that, because everyone knows by now what the Matrix is and they just can't follow more white rabbits or taking blue or red pills any more.So let me comment the movie now : the first half of the movie is most of the time a show gallery : much kung-fu fighting, much bullit-time frames, not much story, with as lowpoint the dancing people scene/ neo-trinity lovemaking. It was just too long. The second half of the movie was the best : still the show gallery, but more impressive, with as absolute highpoint of the entire movie the chase on the highway. But this time there was more story, more information about the matrix, although probably many people got lost in waterfall of words and lines in the Architect-scene. But as i said in the title, the matrix reloaded got better and better, so that's a good sign for the Matrix revolutions. All in all i give this movie a 8.5 on 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I can't say much about the chemistry between Neo and Trinity either--maybe that's because there isn't any!  The fight scene with the multiple Mr. Smiths was interesting for the first 5 minutes...the last 20 minutes of this fight scene were, well...boring as hell.

As it became more apparent that the sequel was soon to be released, to say I bought into all the hype would be an understatement.  I hung on every piece of news and went to see Anger Management just to see the theatrical trailer. Only after the 2 minute preview was over did I remember to breathe again, as I slowly applauded.Because I hate to be crammed into a theater with a bunch of teenagers and college students, I did not go to see Reloaded until two days after its release.  During that time, the nay-sayers, wanna-be critics, and genuinely disappointed came out of the woodwork.  My enthusiasm for this movie dwindled and my hope for a wild ride faded fast.  However, I decided I still had to see it, if only to make up my own mind.Reloaded started out on a high note and never let up.  Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), who was on top of her game throughout, set the tone for the high-octane, unpredictable, and quick moving plot.  The fight scenes seemed fresh, well shot, and maximized to get the most out of them.  Keanu Reeves as the searching Neo, portrayed his character as full of confidence, yet unsure of himself.  The ultra-cool Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), was the leader, warrior, and rebel the film needed.  The last crew member Link, played by Harold Perrineau, had me chuckling from the beginning to the end. He has one of the best one-liners involving Neo rescuing two characters. The numerous villains in Reloaded are stereotypical except for three standouts.  Hugo Weaving played his Smith to excellence.  The twins were the villains this movie needed in order to make a mark.  My only complaint against them is that they were underdeveloped.  Their boss, Merovingian, played by Lambert Wilson, was undeniably cool and had some of the best lines (including after Neo stops several hundred bullets, `Okay, you have some skill.')There are two scenes that obviously stick out in my mind and help make this movie.  The now infamous `Burly Brawl,' where Neo fights several Smiths, then several dozen Smiths, then several hundred Smiths is one.  While this scene had a few obvious CGI issues, and wasn't resolved the way I was hoping for, the overall effect was amazing, with outstanding dialogue between Smith and Neo.  Including in that, the fact that a lot of Smiths were all doing different things and you have a new standard in filmmaking.  Speaking of new standards, the already legendary car chase scene is beyond anything, anyone has ever created or imagined.  The crashes, the fighting, the explosions, the trucks, the agents, the guns, the motorcycle, the sword and the twins all amount into the best twenty minutes or so filmed in action movie history.But, while Reloaded, like the original, will be remembered for its outstanding effects and action, we are looking at one of the most beautifully crafted, executed, and acted movies.  Nowhere in this movie did the dialogue scenes feel just like set-up scenes for the action.  Each scene, but one, seemed to have a point and were executed flawlessly.  I still can't believe some of the cinematography I have witnessed and the musical score added to the overall effect.The philosophies that made The Matrix famous were extremely prevalent in Reloaded.  While all of the hidden meanings weren't all so hidden, and sometimes Reloaded felt like it was trying to hit you over the head with its purposes (like the scene where we found out we need machines as much as they need us), I don't feel like I truly know `how deep the rabbit hole goes.' The very fact I'm still thinking about Reloaded means it made its mark. And the twist that ends this movie, I never saw coming and I'm still reeling from.  The character development, the character depth, and the plot added up to a smart and thought-out movie.While I loved this movie, there were a few scenes I detested and do not want to watch again, especially the love/rave scene.  That scene seemed purposeless and time consuming.  Overall though, Reloaded pushes boundaries in filmmaking, has excellent plot twists and turns, and only enriches the world that is the Matrix.  The Wachowski brothers have done it once again. Reloaded is a masterpiece.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Thought it was funny --- in all the wrong places.  I didn't mind so much that it was ""talky"" - but that much of the talk was repetitive Philosophy 101 nonsense. But that problem was overshadowed by the repetitive nonsense of the endless fight sequences.  (One recommendation - when the fight starts in the playground, take a bathroom break if you need one -- believe me, it will still be the same scene when you get back.) 
In many respects, the movie feels like some mediocre film school version of ""'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' meets 'My Dinner with Andre.'""
The movie wasn't unbearable, but watching it through did feel like a waste of a lot of time.  If I'd had it on video there would have been some serious fast-forwarding.Specifics - Writing was not good. Actors were no better or worse than the last time. Effects were good except for some tatty-looking blue screen work in the highway scene (it looks about as real as footage from when Lucy, Ricky, Ethel and Fred ""drove"" to California on ""I Love Lucy."") Plot development is okay (and unlike complaints I heard, I felt satisfied with the point in the plot the movie ended.) However, by the end I felt that 75% of the plot in TMR is just a MacGuffin, which is a little frustrating.Oh! and it has one of the dullest sex scenes ever recorded on film.I'm still interested in seeing number 3 come the Fall.  But I'm not particularly excited about going to see it.P.S. One question:  Why is it that the residents of Zion all seem to need new clothing (90% of what we see is torn and tattered - except for the female councillor's FABULOUS beaded hat) but seem to have access to large supply of sunglasses in dozens of different styles?  What do they need sunglasses for underground anyway? Maybe there was a big sale at K-Mart.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

There is much more action for all of you buffs out there. The fightings scenes are well done, but also a little over done at times as they seem to be more Computer Generated rather than interesting filming techniques like in the first film. Nevertheless you will probably be amazed be the action. The story is much more complex this time and rather hard to understand. It's fine up until the end when Neo meets and converses with a special someone, but after that your mind will become numb trying to figure it out. All in all this film is great and is worth seeing multiple times, it also leaves you hanging in the end and nicely sets us up for what should be a rather interesting 3rd movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You'd have to be blind to the beauty and the style with which the action scenes and the fights are done. They are way too damn good to feel disappointed.In my opinion also the storyline should not be as easily dismissed as some critics do. The original movie introduced the concept of the Matrix, it was a great strength of that movie since it is such a good concept and we had never seen it before quite like that. It is obviously impossible to introduce it again in the sequel. In fact that is why I initially feared that Reloaded would be a disappointment: how can a movie be interesting if no new concepts have to be developed and the main character is all but omnipotent? But in Reloaded, rather than doing the original movie all over again in a different guise, the story progresses and gives you a larger view of the world of the Matrix.It does not really matter whether or not you buy into the metaphysical dialogue: as long as the world picture presented by the movie is more or less coherent, which it is, it should be interesting for an open-minded viewer to suspend his disbelief and see where the ideas in the movie lead him. This is not to say that the movie should not be criticized; obviously Reloaded is far from perfect: sometimes the dialogue is a bit too pompous; the sex scene might have been a bit shorter, some jokes where a bit childish, Zion is slightly too reminiscent of Star Wars, the image is sometimes too visibly computer-manipulated: all true, but nevertheless such objections are certainly not sufficient to dismiss the Matrix Reloaded, it just has too many qualities.Just keep an open mind, and you'll enjoy what you see!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You may argue that it too is adapted - but that's a weak argument given that the Warchowskis created the material upon which it could be said to have been based.

I will not dispute that the special effects were great, but as opposed to what the directors must have thought, they are not a substitution to other vital elements of a movie. The plot and many of the plot twists had the makings of a great movie, but I felt like the effects were at times over doing it and were just being used to show what they could do.  In addition there are some continuity problems with the movie.  It also seems that much of the movie is run like a freshman philosophy class, and instead of trying to teach you subtly, at every turn the issues are banged into your skull.  There are only so many times I need to hear them talk about free will and choice...Anyway, if you're just looking for a fun time, you can see it, but the original was definitely more enjoyable, and more thought out.

The effects and production values are first rate--Matrix Reloaded shows what can be done if you have a seemingly unlimited budget and the best special effects and martial arts people at your disposal--but I left this one feeling less than satisfied, to say the least, and based upon the boos and catcalls in the theater where I saw the film at an opening day matinee, I can safely say that I wasn't alone.  Matrix Reloaded gets off to a very slow start in its scenes in Zion, recalling the worst snoozefest elements of George Lucas' recent Star Wars films (does anyone but the most obsessive fanboy give a crap about politics in Zion?)  Film begins to right itself once the cast finally leaves Zion and goes back into the Matrix.  While several of the set pieces are impressive, including an imaginatively staged fight between Neo and dozens of Agent Smiths and an intricately choreographed car chase, none of the scenes are truly exciting in the visceral sense where they get your heart pumping and you actually get caught up in what's happening.  Reaction is more detached--like cool, wonder how they did that?  Presumably some of the characters will have bigger parts in the next film--Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith has little to do but replicate himself and engage in martial arts fights with Neo--the audience is given no real clue as to what it is he is actually trying to accomplish; and as for Monica Bellucci's character, if I hadn't read several articles about the film I would have no idea at all what the point of her scene kissing Neo was.  While magazines have played up her character as being a dangerous villain and someone who cannot be lied to because of her powers, there's nothing much to suggest anything like that in this film.  I guess we have to wait for the next one--which is another problem.  While Peter Jackson found dramatically satisfying places in the narrative to end each of his Lord of the Rings films Matrix Reloaded seems to end where it does because they reached the middle in terms of running time--it's like they had a four and a half hour movie and just split it in two.  There were no boos coming from the disappointed audience at the end of the Rings movies, but many people at the theater where I saw Reloaded were positively hostile.  Maybe seeing the next movie will make Reloaded seem more worthwhile, but as it is this one was a bit of a disappointment.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Honestly, I'm unsure.This movie is neither as good as those who type with caps lock down insist it is (U HAVE TO GO SEE THIS FILM OR U R DUMB!) nor as bad as the cynics claim. It does seem to diverge significantly from the first one, but more on that later.Ebert is right. The ""philosophy"" is far too shallow to try to analyze. They seem to touch on a lot of free will/determinist issues somehow aligning free-will with humans and determinism with machines, than questioning those notions, than questioning those questions. As Plato demonstrated, dialogue is necessary in the search for wisdom, but I think we need better lines than ""you mean...programs hacking programs?"" It is bizarre how for the first half-hour of the Matrix Neo was portrayed as very intelligent, until the brother's W decided making him an idiot would force the supporting characters to have to explain everything to him, and thus stripped him of his intelligence. Somehow, though, I feel as if the first movie was genuinely intelligent for at least the first two acts.I agree that the political intriguing in Zion seems pretty unnecessary, though we will have to see what sort of effect it has when the third movie comes out. It might prove to be worthwhile after all.The Link backstory however there is no need for. Where was the backstory for Apoc or Dozer in the first movie? It wasn't there because it detracts. Oh, and message to the W brothers: consciously acknowledging how stupid Neo looks flying doesn't excuse presenting it in such a ridiculous fashion.
CGI does not look real. Does anyone else think that special effects peaked with the original Star Wars trilogy? I would have much rather seen a stunt double.Was Monica Bellucci attractive in this film or what? I have trouble believing a woman like that could have difficulty finding a man who would be passionately attracted to her. The 100 Agent Smiths. What a great idea on paper. Really, imagine sitting around a room and one of the Watchowski's goes ""let's have Neo fight an infinite number of Smith's"" it must have sounded hilarious. But yes, it does look very boring.I generally liked the Architect scene. That alone was worth at least a couple bucks.As far as the ""cliffhanger"" ending. It was not a cliffhanger at all. What is left unfinished -- that we don't know the fate of zion? The third movie has to be about something. Also, consider the first movie which quite obviously leaves even more unfinished. Some people do not understand the function of the middle part of a trilogy. It has to leave room for a third movie. Go check out the empire strikes back. It has virtually the same ending! The claim that this is the first half of a two part movie is ridiculous. It attempts and succeeded at fulfilling its story arc.The love scene & the rave scene. Gratuitous? Pandering? That certainly seems to be the case. I have heard that the dubya's threw it in as an attempt to appeal to the female population. I have to question anyone's intentions who simultaneously seeks to appeal to 10 year old boys and adult females, but really is this not symptomatic of a general trend towards more skin in our culture? Is this really anything new? Are we not already living in a civilization where sex sells and money is the body line? I suppose now is not the time or place to discuss such nevertheless pertinent issues.
So, to rate the Matrix on a scale of 1-10 I would point out that it is a matter of perspective. It is neither an all out masterpiece (A La Jesse Ventura's Abraxas Guardian of the Universe) nor a complete bomb (Jean Luc Goddard's Leon).On a scale of 1/10 I give it a ""vague"".","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I didn't expect the matrix: reloaded to live up to the first instalment, the matrix, but amazingly it did! I believe it is one of the best films that was ever made. It was better than the first matrix. The first matrix had philosophy, profundity, and meaning, reloaded had more. The first matrix had groundbreaking special effects and fight scenes, in reloaded they were more groundbreaking. And the first matrix had great acting and a great story line; in the reloaded it was better. Everything that was good about the first matrix was better in the second. It was harder to understand, but whets the big deal, see it again. A huge amount of thought, time and effort was put into this movie, there is no doubt about that.The movie starts off in Neo's dream where something bad happens or is going to happen. Agent smith is now gone rouge and can get out of the matrix and change others into himself. There is an amazing scene where he fights 100 agent smiths. Neo is told to find the key maker by the oracle and dose so. There is another great scene with trinity and the key maker on a highway. It is the longest car chase ever and cost around $100 million US. It also involves Trinity driving a Ducati motorbike, Cari-anne Moss actually learnt how to drive it for the movie! Anyway the story goes in directions you will never expect. The story finishers at a cliffhanger that will leave you busting to see the Revolutions which come out on November 5 in the US and 6 in Aust. And by the way if you want to see a trailer for the revolutions wait to the end of the credits for a 30 second trailer.Overall the Reloaded lives up to expectations and if you haven't seen it stop reading my review and go and see it now.

The special effects are even better this time round and the characters are developed alot further. We are also given teasing information on the construct of the Matrix, where it came from and how it all works.The film ends on yet another cliff-hanger, a perfect introduction to the final part of the trilogy (Matrix: Revolutions). The only problem with the film is the beginning - it seems to dwell for almost too long on Zion, before we get back to being in the Matrix where the action really kicks off. If they had shortened the first part, this would probably have been equal to the first film, but with it in, it does feel slightly laboured at points.Still one of the finest sci-fi actioners around and please do go and see it on a big screen to fully appreciate the action, but not quite up there with the original.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

They keep saying that Reloaded and Revolutions were 'one sequel split into two parts', and that's what this feels like - half a movie. What's criminal is that I was genuinely bored for much of Reloaded - even some of the action scenes felt bloated (have Neo and Agent Smith not realised that they'll NEVER beat one another in a fistfight?).It's all more Xerox than Matrix.

Where the first one was intuitively unravelling its meaning, this one flat out explains a lot.There's way too much action. The action scenes are actually rather stylish and pleasant, but only for a while, and in this one they just linger and linger...and linger. To the point the viewer may feel a sense of detachment from the flick altogether, and the cheap techno in the background doesn't help making up for the cheesiness. It almost feels like a caricature of the first one, like a totally different team picked up the franchise and expanded it artificially. For example the high way chase scene is seemingly endless, the whole Zion part at the start is in bad taste and Morpheus' speech on the kitsch side... just the name of this sequel, 'The Matrix Reloaded', gives out that tone of being so action-heavy and announces itself as being that big blockbuster.Now there are some really good elements to it though. The movie's opening scene dramatically catches the attention of the viewer (and its resolve at the end is quite interesting). The Merovingian played by Frenchman Lambert Wilson is a great character and the scenes involving him are a treat. Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith continues to be awesome to watch as he brings that strangely ironic/facetious presence to the screen. And the architect scene towards the end is surely a bit too pompous in a sense yet not devoid of substance and a lot of the lines he delivers are Matrix-worthy in quality.6.5/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I came away feeling that the major focus was on style and effects, rather than substance. While there is no doubting that the computer gurus earned their keep on this film, I felt the fight sequences were far too numerous and too lengthy, almost to the point of tedium. Importantly, the element which made the original ""Matrix"" so memorable, the incredible concept of a computer generated world in which we are all prisoners, was not well expanded upon in MR. Instead the storyline seems convoluted and needlessly complicated, and the depictions of Zion altogether too superficial. While I accept that the first priority of any film is to entertain it's audience, I think the directors got carried away with the action side of things, and once the credits began to roll (to a hugely annoying thrash music soundtrack), the overall sense I was left with is disappointment at what could have been a great film. In summary, the brothers Wachowski have failed to capitalize on the greatest strength of the original film, it's marvelous story, opting instead to concentrate on special effects, super-hero style costumes and episodic fight sequences. Disappointing. I certainly won't be queuing up to see the next installment. 7/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's not a bad film by any means, neither is it Lawrence of Arabia, but that shouldn't have been suspected. What especially disturbs me is the comments people make implying that this movie, ""doesn't live up to the first film."" Maybe I'm alone when I say this but...well, the first movie wasn't that great. Don't get me wrong, it's originality was astounding, but the script, and acting, left a little more than a little to be desired. So for the sequel my expectations were greatly lowered.Maybe that is why I enjoyed the sequel much more than the original.  No, one reason I liked the second movie better (and the most shallow reason) is the noticeably better budget, and therefore better special effects. There was one problem with the pyrotechnics, there was a little too much of them. After about the tenth fight scene you just don't care, but I'm more of a plot person anyway.Secondly I enjoyed this movie more because the script was SO MUCH BETTER! In the first film half wit one-liners almost ruined any fun to be had, but thankfully, almost all of that has changed, almost.Finally, some bad news. With the exceptions of Keanu Reeves (Who has gotten better by not acting if you know what I mean) and the Oracle lady, everyone has taken a step backward in portraying their character. Either that, or they were given nothing to play (As in Carrie Ann-Moss's Trinity). But all in all...well, I was not impressed. Sorry to end on a sour note but it had to be said.8/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

My primary gripe, however, would be the lack of clarity about whether people truly die and whether the coming of the ""One"" is illusory and ultimately ineffective.  The content of the movie at times drags when the film makers' philosophical ""commitment"" is revealed but it still has a forward momentum that is highly memorable.I saw it today in our local multiplex and was amazed at the cavalcade of new characters we as fans were presumed to be able to add to the list of heroes/villains.  The initial MATRIX gave them to us a bit more slowly and stayed with a much smaller cast of primary fighters & agents.  All in all, a great movie that will be much discussed and analyzed until the Dec. 2003 third segment of the trilogy is premiered and shows what the brothers Wachowski have to say about all the big topics: reality, free will, causality, salvation, among others.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Now it's up to the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar (Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus; Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity; Harold Perrineau as Link; and, of course, Keanu Reeves as Neo, the chosen one) to save these remnants of humanity. But this is but one of the many plots in a multi-tasked story that sometimes gets tongue-tied in it's attempt to convey the twists and turns, much of which I can't tell you about without spoiling the film. I can tell you that the Matrix program is experiencing too many rogue programs as attempts are made to reboot the system. We also learn more about the Orifice (I mean Oracle) that changes some of what we learned in the first film. Most importantly, the filmmakers did manage to outdo themselves with action scenes and fighting affects that kept me mesmerized with their eye-popping choreography. Even the one-line tongue-in-cheek humor worked every time. I really enjoyed the first Matrix and did enjoy the second. The only thing that bugged me was the verbose attempts to explain what was going on, leaving me asking `What did he say?' much too much. If you liked the first film, you must see the second, but if you never saw the first, you must rent and watch it before you attempt the second or you will not know what the hell is going on. Finally, don't leave during the final credits (as most of my audience did) or you will miss a preview of the third film when the credits complete.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I really didn't think that the Neo/Multiple Smith fight was that good, in fact it was a bit ridiculous and farcical.It would have also been good if Keanu had learned to speak above a whisper. The musical soundtrack is ridiculously loud and the vocal track is pathetically quiet. I can't count how often I took it back to try and hear it clearer the second or even third time. With a film like this you have to be careful or you could really miss something important or you could hear it and have no comprehension of what Colonel Sanders is talking about at all anyway. What a load of babble!I preferred the smaller population of people outside of 'The Matrix' in the first film.

Honestly, I was expecting more from this. I just got out of the 8:35 showing of Reloaded on 05/15/03. Here' my report: Apparently, W Brothers tried to work in a bunch of philosophy into the movie. I noticed it only when Merovingian, The Oracle and The Architect spoke. While the plot didn't seem weak at all, it did seem as though the W Brothers didn't really care about developing it. Why bother with it when you have kick-ass fight scenes (by the way, they all truly kick ass)? However, all the graphics in the world can't make Keanu Reeves act. What were they thinking when they picked him to be a metaphor for the savior of humanity? Also, Hugo Weaving's character (Mr. Smith) gets a very nice ""upgrade"" (to quote Neo)and makes the change from the Bad Machine's Muscle to Pyshcotic Bad Guy very nicely. The cliffhanger ending is a plus as well.Overall, 7/10P.S: Do not bother to stick around for the trailer of Revolutions. It lasts about 30 sec, and you have to wait through about 10 min or so credits and really, really crappy metal (plus a messed up remix of a bad DMB song).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

More than that, though, the Wachowski brothers manage to once again deliver a script that makes you scratch your head and nod at its cleverness. Many reviews have touted a lifeless script, but I would argue just the opposite. The storyline of the Matrix Reloaded manages to turn many concepts the audience has taken for granted into fresh and new story ideas without resorting to trite plot twists and surprise occurances.Hugo Weaving obviously gets to have fun with his role as the gleefully rampant and power-mad Agent Smith, an interesting change from his dire, emotionless role in the first of the series.The effects do still steal the show, however. The Matrix Reloaded, as in the first, managed to amaze a techno-jaded viewer such as myself. There is true artistry in the mayhem of this film. What impressed me the most was that, although I could spot CG characters, I could not quite manage to catch the transitions back into the flesh and blood actors. And the credits pay tribute to this excellence, there is a veritable army listed as the crew for this film.I hoped beyond hope for a sequel that would excite me and make me glad that I love movies so much, and the Matrix Reloaded delivered in full.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It seemed like too much emphasis had been placed on the effects (although I am sure many people flock to watch Matrix Reloaded for it). I came out of the movie rating it 6.5/10. ""What a letdown,"" I thought. I was disappointed. This wasn't the movie I waited for 4 years to see! Sure, I enjoyed the highway chase scene (that will go down in history to be the greatest chase scene, bar none), who didn't? But I expected more from the Wachowski Brothers.It was when I was watching it the second time around that I realised how mindblowing the plot was, or should I say how ingenious the construct of the Matrix was! The irony of it all is that the Matrix is perfect in its imperfection. And many things said in the beginning of the movie will come back to haunt us towards the end. This movie needs to be watched at least twice for one to be able to grasp the full implications of whatever the characters did and the consequences that result.Here's to Matrix Revolutions in November! See you guys then!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Some who hated it, thought it was just an action flick with too much emphasis on special effects.For both camps, this movie goes much deeper.  The true brilliance of The Matrix, which I believe has been surpassed by Reloaded, is found in the ideas behind the story.  Layers upon layers of sometimes conflicting philosophy speak to the heart of human nature, our perception of reality and the very meaning of life.Reloaded suggests that we, that our lives, are about purpose...that choice is a blessing and a curse ... and that hope is our greatest strength and our greatest weakness.  But in the end, after digging further down into the rabbit hole, The Matrix: Reloaded demonstrates that it's really all about - faith.And this is why, after the first weeks of spectacle-seeking fans pass through, audiences will continue to flock to this movie to see it again and again, propelling it to become the most successful R rated movie of all time.So have a little faith, and keep thinking before you make up your mind about The Matrix: Reloaded.  If you do, you may gain a new appreciation for more than just a great film, but also for some very important thoughts.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Everyone was baffled by the first one - only because it was such a stealth hit. The first movie grabbed everyone by the nuts and whispered in their ear: ""Movies have changed"". And the sight of Neo dodging a bullet became movie history almost immediately. After bullet-time became a regular target for millions of copycat products, it was obvious that the Wachowski boys couldn't just stick to what they know - and they were given the greenlight to do exactly the opposite. Unlocking 300 million dollars from Warner Brothers, they would finally have he opportunity to create the gaudy and epic saga they longed for since they first pitched their creation to the studios, almost 10 years ago. But how would the founders of a new era live up to the rivers of internet speculation, salivating geeks and millions of instant cult fanatics? Easy, you just go one step up. And that is the problem with ""Reloaded"": the line between quantity and quality becomes very, very thin, and reminds us even briefly that the same trouble made ""The Phantom Menace"" tank among most people. And indeed, there a few moments that feel utterly superfluous. But one important thing to notice: this is the Wachowskis, not Lucas. And what you have here is a movie that, like the first one, makes us think what the direction of movies is these days, and even if they don't create a new filmmaking era, they surely make their point clear: there is nothing that can't be done when there's imagination and money. Boasting some of the most spectacular special effects of the last 10 years, their most important detail is that you never can really tell what's FX or not, because their impact on the viewer is so incredibly electrifying. Okay, so it's no longer a question of storytelling like the first one, and okay, what matters is the filmmaking verve and the way the boundaries of the concept of ass-kicking are pushed. But you won't really care, even if some point of you will be a bit let down because that sheer ""Matrix"" feeling the first one gave you is not there. So, the key to really enjoying this movie is never thinking of it like a sequel of compulsory ass-kicking, and instead try to see it as the Matrix times 100. And your jaw will drop with a little more conviction. Even with its flaws, this is serious landmark filmmaking, even if in a simple technical level, and is a case of must-see. Some of the things in here will require years to be surpassed, and ""the thing that will bake our noodle later on"" is trying to imagine what on earth can surpass this.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, the effects and scenes, while there are significantly new and better tricks and techniques, they're just par or even slightly lower to my expectation compare to the lasting impression from the first Matrix. They are still great though.The best part is of course still the story, concept, plot, and philosophy. Surprisingly, it exceeds my expectation. The story flows naturally from the prequel while keeping the unpredictable sequences here and there which have been put in the proper places. On the bad side, it's still a little bit confusing, even for hardcore fans. Most people I know are still in 70-80% understanding. Second time watch should be suffice to get the fullest picture (which is a good reason to buy the DVD ;). And also the long and tedious dialogs have proven to be distracting to a lot of people.
* For the rest:It has long, tedious and uncomprehensible dialogs, but as well as great effects and scenes. If you haven't watched the prequel yet, you'd better do before seeing this one. Otherwise there's no way you'd appreciate this movie.My rating: 9/10, 1 being taken because unfortunately it's quite heavy (not for everyone) unlike the prequel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It forced the audience to juggle many thoughts and observations without letting us resolve them into simple plot and character devices. The film's most powerful statements were never directly stated at all. Like a good mystery, clues were given but the truth remained hidden - often in the viewer himself.The extreme popularity of the first Matrix film handicaps the second installment. Two clichés describe the situation perfectly: 1) ""familiarity breeds contempt"" and 2) ""expectation is the death of happiness."" The success of the first film earned the Wachowski brothers the right to paint with many more colors but the size of the canvas remains fixed by the first film. Tough job and a job well done!Just like the first film, The Matrix - Reloaded asks questions and promotes themes. Although the dialog sounds like freshman philosophy students the messages are not trivial. The focus remains on asking the right questions rather than finding the right answers. At the risk of creating a diatribe here are some themes well handled in this film.1. Cyber Integration: The implications to integrating the information network with everyday life has vast consequences. The definitions of privacy, power, skill, defense, and currency will change drastically as their traditional boundaries of influence morph to accommodate a new paradigm (as I said, freshmen philo).2. Machines Have no Passion: Machines and their attendant programs know only their purpose. Even the Oracle cannot transcend her purpose, but, the humans in Zion can revel in public passion and private intimacy. Great juxtaposition!3. Philosophy vs. Spirituality: While the machines understand and design philosophical constructs they lack the ability to synthesize spirituality. They simply do not understand a purpose greater than themselves let alone submitting to a higher power.4. Freedom of Choice vs. Predestination: Philosophers have argued these ideas as a zero-sum game in which the two cannot coexist. The conversation between Neo and the Oracle does not avoid this question.5. Death: Is the world so constrained that death is merely deletion from the matrix?6. Love is a Choice: Neo must choose between love and purpose. He chooses to prioritize love over duty and willingly endangers himself and Zion. This is not a zero-sum game.7. Winning the War Is Not Destroying Your Enemy: Man still depends on machines in Zion, the machines still depend on man in the Matrix. Coexistence seems necessary.In conclusion, The Matrix and its sequels are e-ticket rides I want to enjoy repeatedly. Can't wait for Revolutions!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It begins innocently enough with a dream, but becomes more when it is discovered that the machines are heading for Zion. The first movie was well done, being way ahead of it's time, but it lacked the good story to make it perfect. This movie goes many steps farther. The story is unique,but still the same as the first: Neo must stop the machines. The plot is still pretty mush the same, as are the special effects, with the exception of the highway chase. To put it mildly, somebody would say that this was an okay movie. It was better than that. This movie had depth. The Wachowski brothers knew people wanted more of what the matrix is, and they go so deep as to explain it as a reality, a construct, as a program, and as a living being that is nothing more than an enemy that must be destroyed. You are given a history of the matrix, as well as a history of the programming, and of the programs. The real world scenes are just as amazing. Finally, after long wait, we get to see Zion, the last city of the humans. Better still, there are many more establishing shots of the hoverships in the real world, allowing us to see what has happened. All in all, the movie was just as unique as the first, and just as mind-blowing. If anything, pay attention to the freeway scene. The multiple Smith's are also a nice touch, but the fight is slightly overdone. Don't mind the occasional cheesy dialogue, either. This movie is well worth the price of admission.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This film, despite it's excellent editing and special effects, is ponderous and pretentious, with leaden acting (the dialogue is spoken as if it's italicized).

It's what makes me give the movie my final rating.My complaints are:1) The dialogue, it's as though when this script was written the Bros. kept refering to a thesaurus just to make it sound ""intelligent"" when it doesn't have to (like the first one). I got the movie fine, but I was not impressed by the delivery.2) There was also a slight overkill with the action, the first had a perfect blend of story and action.3) Should have been more screen time for the virus twins.4) The weapons suck in Reloaded compared to the first one.It was good movie, but not great like I expected. It's worth the price of admission. I don't know if I want to ""reload"" this into my DVD collection though... will have to wait and see what Revolutions offers.Final Rating: 8/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was also somewhat disappointed that keanu reeves did not say ""woah."" The entire film. The plot was tired, heavy-handed, pretentious and predictiable since it's all given away before they ever leave Zion; but we're not really going for the plot, are we? Furthermore, it was very closely paralleling star wars at many points and even some of the angles were the same. I wouldn't be suprised if Neo and Trinity were brother and sister.However, it was definitly worth seeing and I would def. recomend it. Overall, too hyped up for yet another hollywood sequel to a hollywood vehicle.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The action scenes are superb and the one where Neo fights a hundred Agents Smiths is already a classic. Unfortunately the philosophical script is very boring and the scenes in Zion reminded me of Battlestar Galactica. This movie would be better if there were no Zion and everybody go to war inside the Matrix, where the action reigns. The first Matrix is a science-fiction masterpiece with a genious plot and state of the art effects. This one looks like ""Star Wars - The Phantom Menace"". Too much expectation let most people frustrated.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It has a slow meandering start which leads to a good end. The good things are that the fight scenes are quite good. The story is interesting after the first half an hour. The philosophical discussions are pretty good.The main problem with the movies is that this is a movie that suffers a problem common to most sequels. Where the budget is 10 times larger, the action is 10 times more, there are 10 times more characters and their is 10 times more story. The net effect typically is that it is 1/10th of the original. The Godfather 2 is a perfect example of how to make a good sequel. The story of how the Godfather's origin is a small simple story which is great to watch. In the Matrix Reloaded there just seems to be too much going on and with Neo now having God like powers there is nobody to really challenge him, he just seems to have meaningless fight scenes. In the Matrix Neo was the underdog and thats what makes the fight scenes fun to watch. Also the fight scenes in the sequel are too complicated, there is too much to watch. In the original the subway fight scene between Agent smith and Neo was perfect. It was one on one and easy to follow. The other disappointment that I had was that some of the special effects seemed to look fake. In the first fight scene where Neo battles hundreds of Agent Smith. There are some slow motions scenes where you can see a computerized Keanu Reeves which is not very well done. Overall I give it a 8/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It appears to me that there was only enough material for two films and this middle part was stretched with unnecessary character development both new and old.We all know that the first Matrix film was supposed to end with a trip to Zion but that was changed at the bequest of Silver.  It appears that his control over the plot and structure was all for him to make 30% more money, not out of character for him.For example, coming from the UK where we have had many atrocious club culture movies it is well documented that any club/dancing scene will only lead you down a dark cliché road that will be viewed as space filler. The whole shake the room (Will Smith anyone?) speech could have ended nicely with about one minute of dancing to give the impression of a happy Zion interspersed with Neo and Trinity love-making (another cliché I thought the Wachowskis would rise above and again was over long) instead it was laborious viewing with the same girl viewed about three times because she was scantily clad (another cliché).This cliché theme continued in a bid to out-Hollywood Hollywood with any standard movie fare being extended beyond belief, I draw your attention the French baddie, the evil English twins, the large number of breasts on show, the car chase (great scene which had me gripping my seat but a cliché none the less), the wise old man (twice - Star Wars anyone), the choice between love and salvation, need I go on.However I stress I did enjoy this but I believe there was no need for this movie the three should have been two. Therefore, I can't wait for Revolutions, as I believe it will be the best, even if you can work out half the plot from Reloaded.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

We are now accustomed to the visual effects that were revolutionary in the last film and have to rely on plot to carry us through the next chapter.  That being said, there are some really great twists in this film and it visually surpasses the first part of the trilogy.  The highway chase is absolutely mind boggling.  The weakness of the second film is probably Neo himself, Keanu Reeves.  In the first film, he is basically confused and discovers the world outside The Matrix just as we do.  All he has to do is observe and react and nobody does ""befuddled"" and ""bewildered"" better than Keanu.  In this film however, he is now familiar with this world, so his relationships with Trinity, Morpheus, and the other citizens of Zion have to carry the movie.  His one-liners come off as cheesy and artificial.  Also the love story between Trinity and Neo is really emphasized so you're going to see a lot of dialogue between those two characters.  Still, all and all, the movie is extremely entertaining, visually superb, and promises to conclude the story in a really thrilling, unpredictable way.  By the way, STAY IN THE THEATRE AT THE END OF THE MOVIE. THERE IS A TRAILER FOR THE LAST FILM!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

ACTIONBecause ""Matrix"" did so well at the box office, Warner Brothers demanded the Wachowski Brothers and company another sequel as well as a third even though the first one stands alone on it's own, and by doing so offered huge salaries for everybody who wanted in, especially Keanu Reeves who was paid the most from this of 15 or was it 25 million to star in 2 and 3! In my opinion all this is a major cash grab for the Warner Brothers! To explain the plot of this is idiotic because it consists more meandering whatever one would know from the first one, all it's left is the action. The action scenes are new but 98% of it is quite boring which includes many boring fights with wires, special effects and fast- forward special effects all in one. Action auteur Yuen Woo- Ping who worked from Jackie Chan to Bruce Lee directed the action for all three films except that the first one consists of something inventive and new people had never saw before. I mean, to see someone fight using plenty of wires and effects that everybody has already seen before can be downright boring! The only action scene I liked of this one is occurs only on the beginning involving Trinity played by Carrie Ann Moss where a big explosion happens and use of a bike helmet to beat up on some guys is very cool to look at.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Ever. Worse than I, Robot, worse than Lost In Space. Yes, it's that bad. Just try to endure the ""Cave Rave"" scene through its entirety and you'll see what I mean.When I first saw the original Matrix, I wondered how the Wachowski brothers could top themselves with the second movie in the series. Well, they didn't. It's like they decided to skip #2 and go directly to #3 when it came to upping the ante. This movie sucks. It sucks real bad, and I'm disappointed that I wasted two hours of my life watching this dreck.For starters, the dialogue is horrible. It seems that the directors chose to mimic the original Star Trek t.v. show for cheesy speeches and boring conversations between characters. I don't think there is one line of redeemable dialogue in this flick; it makes all the actors sound like they didn't pass the fifth grade.The special effects, while passable in some places, are simply horrible in others. The fight scene between Neo and the dozens of Agent Smiths looks like it was copied out of a cutscene from some video game made in 1998. And the exploding trucks after the chase scene looked just as bad. CGI technology has gotten to the point where these kinds of goofs are inexcusable. Heck, Jurassic Park looks better.The action in the first Matrix was well-paced, while in Reloaded it seems like the directors wanted to showcase all the money they received from the studio by filling every action scene with as much CGI and exploding debris as possible. The chase scene on the freeway should have been fun and exciting, but it turned boring after about three minutes. Ditto for the Merovingian mansion fight.I've heard many people say that Reloaded is the one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made, and I am at a loss as to how they were fooled into believing this. Maybe it's the fact that Reloaded (and the rest of the series, for that matter) disguises its humble action/adventure origins in a cloak of grade school quasi-philosophy. Seriously, if you think that the Matrix series has some kind of deep, in-depth psychological meaning, then you need to go back to college and take some real philosophy courses. I do understand the point that the Wachowski bros. are trying to get across, but don't insult my intelligence by telling me that the Matrix is a serious discussion in subjective reality. It's not even close.The only good part about this movie is Monica Belucci and her cleavage. It's too bad such a great actress got stuck in some of the worst scenes.Calling this movie a science fiction classic belittles real classics such as Metropolis, Soylent Green, Blade Runner, and Akira. You're just comparing apples to oranges.On a side note, I've only seen this movie on the DVD that came with the Matrix collector's edition (the one with the resin bust of Neo). I have to say the sound quality on this disc is horrible. All of the quieter parts are so muffled I have to turn up the volume just to hear any dialogue, only to have my eardrums ruptured once the music or explosions kick in. Strangely enough, this is only a problem on this particular disc; it doesn't happen with the other discs in the collection. Anybody else have this issue?","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The special effects are amazing and after waiting in line for an hour and a half for the midnight premiere it was well worth it.Although it did feel like it borrow heavily from other movies (Star Wars, Terminator 2, Superman), and those who have seen the movie will know what I'm talking about, it did feel like it retained the sense of the original rather than go the way of so many other sequels.Overall a good sequel that will possibly be part of something that builds the zeitgeist for our generation.Cons: Not enough development of some characters, the romantic side seemed a bit cliched at times, sometimes complex and hard to understand philosophical monologues.Pros: new characters, more comprehensive plot, well choreographed fight sequences. great soundtrack, and amazing special effects.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I've never seen action scenes like this movie had to offer.  The fight scenes were just unreal!  The fight where Neo takes on 100 Agent Smith's got a little repetitive and you could tell some parts were obviously fake, but it was still pretty cool.  The movie does not really pick up until the main characters leave Zion and enter the Matrix.  Right after they leave it goes Neo vs. Seraph, Neo vs. 100 Agent Smith's, then after they meet the Merovingian it goes hey wire.  Neo Fights like 8 of the Merovingians henchmen and takes them to school, he stops a sword with his bare hand for God's sake.  That was my favorite part.  Then Morpheous and Trinity have to escape the evil twins which was amazing.  The whole chase scene was one of the coolest things I've ever seen.  Just based on the action alone I give this movie a 10.  I know they're going to top the action in this movie in the third installment, and I can't even imagine what we the Wachowski brothers have in store for us.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I must say that it is now at the very top of my list of ""Movies I Will Lose Count of How Many Times I Have Watched Them"".  It was a great movie, and was not the least bit confusing. For those that DID think it was confusing, you have to ask yourself how well you understood the first movie - the second one isn't geared towards newcomers.  Also, you need to know what to look for and get used more to the Wachowski's style. The effects were really really good, I saw the movie in a prescreening at 7:00 on Wednesday with the VFX company; and though some say many of the scenes were long or unnecessary, I think they worked very well.  The ending I found was very satisfying and they chose a very good place to have a cliffhanger.  Any earlier and it would have driven the average moviegoer insane.  The plot was well-developed and it is definitely a good follow-up of the first Matrix.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

We all expected this movie to blow us away and dumbfound us with questions like: ""How the f*%k did they do that?"" and ""Where is this going to take us in the next movie of the trilogy?""  I got my tickets a few days early to make sure I was going to see it on opening night and I found myself, along with my friends, unable to sustain the excitement as we sat in the theater waiting for The Matrix Reloaded to begin.  So it begins... ...and at first I was like that was a cool opening, but it could have been better; definitely not as good as the opening of X2, but it was good.  As the movie went on I grew more and more excited.  I think the passion between Neo and Trinity is a well deserved and a much needed bonus to the movie. You clearly get a feeling of love, trust, lust, and devotion between the two.Now my excitement is directed toward Neo and his ""god-like"" abilities.  I feel like a little kid staring in awe when Neo takes on the Agent Smiths. When Neo flys, it is truly amazing...he is the ultimate cool...the ultimate superhero.  You finally believe he is ""the one.""  By the end of the movie you may be confused a bit with what happens, and what is said by ""the Architect,"" but it really doesn't take away from the giddyness and satisfaction you get from Neo kicking ass.  I felt I understood what was going on and what is to come, but you will have to figure that out for yourself.  Just pay attention to what ""the Architect"" is saying, or rather, preaching.This basically boils down to...a superhero.  I thought it had answered my questions and also made me ask more, and want more.  After the movie had ended I found myself comparing him to Superman and Jedi Knights.  I recommend you go see The Matrix Reloaded and don't believe anyone's reviews; just go in, sit back, and free you're mind.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They saw a flawed, failed work, lacking in passion or visceral impact as one reviewer implied. They saw a film that failed to live up to the promise in the original film. I did not see that failure. What I saw was a direct continuation of the philosophy, of the world view introduced in the original The Matrix. Critics and viewers focus on the action and the adventure, but in my opinion those viewers have missed the point utterly. In the world presented in The Matrix Reloaded, action is at best secondary. The fight is not the end but the means. The technology used in the filmic world as well as to produce the film are only tools. What I saw in the film was a war where none of the combatants recognized their own futility. Both sides are fighting for control that neither can have. I saw tonight a brilliant film. It was not perfect, but it is beautiful. The sex was overdone, the comedy was over the top. These are minor complaints though. The moments of cheesy sentimentality were a minority. On the whole, I think the film is breathtaking. I am awed by a filmmaker's courage to refuse to declare a truly ""bad guy."" I do not feel I can form a more coherent opinion about this film right now. I think its impact must settle in upon me before I can really know or express what I think about this movie. And for that reason, I apologize for my rather disjointed and alinear commentary.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If it's wasn't for the fact that is night and there aren't any theatres open I would be sitting in one and watching the movie again. Now about the film itself, I won't give anything away so I can't really go into detail about it. During the first hour of the film I was thinking allright this is all really good and it's definitely a great film but I had the feeling that the story wasn't progressing, there wasn't anything really new about it and when the car chase began I thought to myself, this can't be it, there has to be more to it then just great action sequenses. And then there it was, the story began to catch up with the action. And from there on the movie just got a hold of me, I can't let it go. I want to see it over and over again until revolutions is released and I don't think I can wait that long.There's another thing that I would like to mention, well 2 actually, the first one is about the special effects, in the matrix those effects were very realistic but in reloaded you can see where the computer helped out, but it's allright cause it is so well done that you just want to believe it's all real. And the movie is really funny too, the whole audience was laughing throughout the film and it's not because it's stupid, it's just really funny.

On revisit I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the first one still holds up.
The effects, sound, action, plot, acting were all great.
If you have not seen the Matrix for a while but you are afraid that your memory is rose tinted - watch it again. It really is as good as you remember.Reloaded
We return to the world of the Matrix with Neo and his new found powers.
At first there is so much good stuff here.
We get some post apocalyptic real world and some new interesting characters.
Except the real world stuff is boring and the new characters are stupid.
This was a struggle to watch, despite the amount of action, it was very boring and I cared little about what happened.Revolutions
We are back again. Are we in the Matrix are we in the real world? Does it even mater?
It turns out not.
Time to take the horse-sized-pretentious-suppository.
What is reality? what is self determination? what is.. yawn
The main purpose of this film is to dump over the first two and make you realise it was all pointless on most levels.
This was much easier to watch than the second as about a third of the way in I was happily playing on my phone only glancing up at the screen to see if Neo had caught his train yet.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

A true matrix fan will NOT and i repeat will NOT give this movie anything less than a 3 out of 5. I admit it may not be ""PERFECT"" as your royal majesty wants but is there really such a thing as a perfect movie or what's more surprising a perfect sequel?No there isn't. Let's face it, i am sure we all had our own expectations for this movie and for some of us there were not satisfied and for others they were more than satisfied, but i mean to go as far as saying that this is the worst movie you have ever seen is a wild and i mean a wild exaggeration. Personally for me this movie more than met my expectations.Another thing, some people found this movie a little confusing and that part i agree with. Its a little confusing and the reason for that is that the movie hasn't ended. Reloaded and revolutions are both one movie to fully understand reloaded you must see revolutions. I mean in ""Empire Strikes Back"" I liked the movie but it hadn't ended i couldn't really say wether i liked it until i saw Return of the jedi"", because watching Empire was like watching only half of a 5 hour movie. So can you honestly tell me that you can fully judge how much you like it or hate it just by seeing half of it?My advice to those who haven't seen Reloaded but are huge fans of the original matrix is to lower your expectations not necessarily to the floor, just don't expect this movie to be the next Casablanca when you walk into the theatre because you will be disappointed in some level.Summary: Let's be honest, this movie is the sequel to the best Science-Fiction movie of the decade ,now those are some pretty big shoes fill in. Now as a movie it is pretty good. It was awesome. It had mindblowing special effects, the duplicate smiths were cool,thought provoking and very realistic. The beginning is a wee bit slow and kinda tedious but once the first 45 min pass its a roller coaster ride till the cliffhanger ending. As a sequel , now we all know that most sequels suck and tend to be kind of like bad photocopies of the original but this ain't one of them. This movie goes right up there with ""Empire Strikes Back"",""Terminator 2"" and""The Godfather 2"" as one of the best possible sequels ever made.A+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++   10/10I totally recommend this film to anyone who loved the first Matrix and loves thought provoking Sci Fi movies.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

particular Silver I do like this film, both as a stand-alone feature and
as
the second part of The Matrix story but I have some serious reservations
about the structure of the movie.I like the way it builds on the original, I like the character extensions,
the fight scenes, the pop philosophy, basically everything but it seems to
me that each scene was over long and too many times the point was
laboured.
It appears to me that there was only enough material for two films and
this
middle part was stretched with unnecessary character development both new
and old.We all know that the first Matrix film was supposed to end with a trip to
Zion but that was changed at the bequest of Silver.  It appears that his
control over the plot and structure was all for him to make 30% more
money,
not out of character for him.For example, coming from the UK where we have had many atrocious club
culture movies it is well documented that any club/dancing scene will only
lead you down a dark cliché road that will be viewed as space filler. The
whole shake the room (Will Smith anyone?) speech could have ended nicely
with about one minute of dancing to give the impression of a happy Zion
interspersed with Neo and Trinity love-making (another cliché I thought
the
Wachowskis would rise above and again was over long) instead it was
laborious viewing with the same girl viewed about three times because she
was scantily clad (another cliché).This cliché theme continued in a bid to out-Hollywood Hollywood with any
standard movie fare being extended beyond belief, I draw your attention
the
French baddie, the evil English twins, the large number of breasts on
show,
the car chase (great scene which had me gripping my seat but a cliché none
the less), the wise old man (twice - Star Wars anyone), the choice between
love and salvation, need I go on.However I stress I did enjoy this but I believe there was no need for this
movie the three should have been two. Therefore, I can't wait for
Revolutions, as I believe it will be the best, even if you can work out
half
the plot from Reloaded.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

NEO starts thinking by him self and asking him self questions, which actually makes him THE ONE, not ability to fly or some cool tricks. There is no black and white any more it's a matter of you CHOICE what do YOU prefer. And that is the BIG difference from lots of comics books movies we see now.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I wasn't looking for anything shockingly new, but I had high hopes for Reloaded. And the movie never comes through.First off, the first half of the film takes place in Zion. Does that sound interesting? Well, it's not. Endless stretches of awkward conversations and exposition, all of it moving at a snail's pace. Remember how the first movie, even though it had a lot to explain, made it seem exciting none the less? Well this story isn't interesting. And they spend 10-15 minutes in some kind of massive dance. Ugh.The good news is Reloaded picks up and starts to remind you of why you paid $10 to see this picture. Once Neo meets Smith in their well-publicized clash, the movie becomes very energetic and well-paced. That sequence, along with the freeway stuff, pays off as expected. But does half of a really cool movie make up for the awful half? I say no.One of the most disappointing sequels I've seen. The parallels to Phantom Menace and Back to the Future II are remarkable.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Well, keep on reading.Like the first movie this is not to everyones taste buds, as this is a hyper martial arts sci-fi movie.The first movie was clean and suitable for the majority. Surprising that MATRIX RELOADED has quite a number of strong sexual references which I was disappointed about, as it is not suitable for a wider audience, compared to the first.The fight and action scenes are amazing and very lengthy indeed, which is great for fighting fans and is way too much for the average persons mind.The same lines and phrases used were too frequent through out the film e.g. ""It was meant to be.""""Without purpose"".""There is purpose"".The truth is that the Wachowski brothers (directors who are Jewish in religion)are sending a religious message and projecting their own beliefs to the audience (maybe subliminally)which is a belief that we are all destined to do what we are doing (fate)and that there is a God.You might think that this is corny, but it is not. Listen to the sentences from either Matrix 1 or 2 and there is more of an in-depth meaning trying to be shown. E.g The Architect in Matrix reloaded is supposed to represent 'God' of the Matrix, who holds a pen. He is in white, has a beard, and is watching and controlling everything within the Matrix. He can also read the emotions of the people. Now you cant tell me that they are not trying portray God? THEY ARE!!The Wachowski bros. are trying to propagate their message through these films, which on the outside look entertaining, and on the inside have some spiritual meaning.I enjoyed it. Listen carefully and try to understand the films message, and you might get more to think about from it.Recommended film for only people who like: SCI-FI FANS, MARTIAL ARTS FANS, CGI EFFECTS FANS & THE RELIGIOUS. 9/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

He could see the Matrix for what it really was, and could stop bullets and fly because he was no longer bound by its reality.In this sequel, he's instead essentially become a superhero with powers. That's nowhere near as good.The CGI they used for Neo is so painfully obvious and BAD. The bullet time in the first movie looked so great and surreal because it was REAL footage. Here, it's not only obviously fake in places, in battles they FREQUENTLY switch to slow motion so you can get a good long look at just how fake it is.The highway scene is cool, but contains a shockingly apparent continuity error (Morpheus' sword location) that you marvel a movie with this kind of burger could have such a flaw.Pacing: Reloaded could really have used a trim. The most notorious scene is the rave. Personally, I think the whole scene should be cut, including Morpheus's speech, but it certainly should have been trimmed to the bone and kept the same message they were going for. Well, unless that message was to bore the audience silly.The overall pacing is so bad, I wonder if they just ran out of time to edit.Well, they're making a Matrix 4, and my attitude is exactly what it was when Star Wars Solo was announced: if I hear a whole bunch of real life people harping on how fantastic it is, I'll take an early look. Otherwise, maybe check it out when it shows up free on one of the streamers.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

A movie that I have been looking forward to, ""The Matrix Reloaded"", has been getting mixed reviews by critics and fans. Some thoughts, coming from direct friends, were also pretty jaded saying there was no emotion, and the fight scenes went on too long, and there's hardly any plot... and more. A great thing happened today. That great thing is that these people who thought it was bad in any slight respect is wrong. Not only are they wrong, they are monumentally wrong. Everyone has their opinion, but what I just seen in theaters today was the most amazing, exhilirating, breathtaking, emotional mind jobs I've seen in a very long time. To put it lightly, it was indeed the messiah sequel I was wanting, and then some. Better than the original, and by far even.Call me wrong, but I know what I seen today. And it was magical. I'm the only person off or online who seemed to absolutely love the dance scene. The entire humanity of it -it established so many things at once, was necessary for so many reasons. It was one, a symbol of their rebellion against 'sleep', the machines' goal, two, a huge reinforcement of the powerful bond between Trinity and Neo, which made their scenes later mean much more (in perfect contrast to how a certain character in X2 didn't have enough time for it's scenes later in the film to matter much, in my opinion), three, a definite way to establish Zion as more than just a repository of human beings, but the last living, thriving pulse of humanity in the world, a celebration especially after Morpheus' speech.My god, awesome audio-visual piece, in my opinion. I thought it was an interesting way to combine the man/machine concept, seeing the plugs still in their spines and limbs, while an act of love was going on. I loved that entire sequence through and through, one of my favorite parts of the film. Some of the acting could have been better... but the complaints stop there. It had no more ""bad stuff"" than the first movie, and I'm actually going to say this was a LESS FLAWED film than the original. How can I say that?
Easy. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" has MORE human moments, MORE soul, and MORE emotion. It does, no argument. There are so many things about this movie that is just a complete trainwreck of emotion. I felt bad for the people of Zion. But more importantly, I felt their struggle. Their need to celebrate, party, have sex... the works. Like I said, if I were in their situation, God knows... I'd be a party animal. Heard that phrase ""party like there is no tomorrow?"" That's the idea. Also, Morpheus' speech before the act was quite captivating, well acted, and sent tingles down my spine.More about the film: Morpheus. Morpheus felt like a NATURAL LEADER. He was different because he was in a different position. He is no longer the main man: out of Zion, yes. In Zion? Not hardly, though he is well respected. His words were wise, his feelings were portrayed very nicely, and his overall character was handled to an extreme plane that most films lack. Neo: Neo was just how he should be. He takes orders from his superiors, he owns a lot of ass, and he is just damn cool. I loved his conversation with the Oracle.
Nice. Hell, everything including Neo was nice. It was just a continuation of his character, and I'm happy with it. Trinity was HEART AND SOUL. Hear me: HEART and SOUL. God, I love this woman. I love this character. When Persephone made Neo kiss her, I sank in my seat, just ripped to shreds. People say there is no emotion in this film? I say they are GRAVELY mistaken. When Neo brought her back to life like she brought him back to life in the first movie, I was moves to damn tears.Well, Not NECESSARILY moved to tears because of the emotion (though it played a huge part in it) but moved because of how incredible and amazing it was to see someone bring someone else back to life with nothing but PURE LOVE. Of course, starting her heart back was amazing in itself but it takes love to accomplish this. Very moving, and one of the best scenes of all time.All time.The other characters... Zee, Niobe, Lock, the architect, the Oracle... good. Very good. Mona Gaye was perhaps one of the better actresses in the film. I could feel her not wanting Link to go onto the Nebberchunezzer. She didn't get much screen time, but when she was there, I felt great emotion. The twins are the Darth Mauls of this film. They are in it exactly as long as they should be, and they play their part-- to be totally badass-- with perfect precision and accuracy. Holy hell. Persephone. God, I loved her character too. This was my first time seeing Monica Bellucci in a role, and I must say I'm pleased with the results. She is not only nice to look at, but very deep and quite cool.Next, Zion. Holy..... When we are first introduced to Zion with that awesome directing and epic music, I just felt like crying. Amazing. This was truly science fiction at its finest. I gaped and awed at the glorious city of human resistance. It was beautiful and majestic. A true sci-fi environment, completely realized by the directors. The action? For me, it was all about regaining consciousness. I liked the first few fights OKAY, then when the burly brawl commenced, well, consider me a loyal fan of this scene. Long. Tense. Oh my God? YES. I am truly out of words.People say ""well why didn't Neo fly away to begin with?"" BECAUSE HE DID NOT HAVE THE CHANCE TO, DUH. YIKES, WHAT DO YOU PEOPLE EAT FOR DINNER? It has obviously rectified your thinking pattern. As you PROBABLY DID NOT NOTICE, it takes a while for Neo to gain the momentum to fly away. KIND OF HARD WHEN YOU HAVE ONE HUNDRED REPLICAS OF AGENT SMITH ON YOUR ASS.
Now that that's over, just let me have a moment to myself concerning the freeway sequence.
*moment of silence*Okay, I'm done. Of course, I will probably have several more moments of silence before I sleep tonight, but that's just one. There isn't any adjectives that can properly describe the amazingness and intensity of that scene. The way Murphus takes out the twins? Hold me someone, boy or girl, I don't care-- this scene is overwhelming and quite frankly I am not worthy to bask in the glory of it. How this scene was filmed, I don't know. And you know what? That's the magic of it.Plot: Does this have more story than the original? Does this have a better story than the original? In my opinion, they have thier equal values, but I'm going with this new story. That's right, I enjoyed this story more. Why? The first movie was about discovery, this was about human life- about what it takes to survive, morality, CHOICE-- it's all in place, hand in hand. Some of the issues discussed between the characters were quite captivating.
I suck at remembering dialogue on a first showing, but I loved nearly everything that was said regarding the human spirit.What makes us human? It's all discussed. The machines are digging to Zion, and the fate of mankind is at serious risk. The whole subplots with the Keymaker, KEYMAKER- not KEYMASTER, so PLEASE CEASE AND DESIST with your ""THAT WAS TOO MUCH LIKE GHOSTBUSTERS"" bull. Yes, it may have seemed that way or came off that way, but this was COMPLETELY different. Another thing that makes me happy-I didn't understand jack **** during the architect scene.
That's why I want to see this movie again as soon as humanly possible-- not only did it deliver the action goods, but the STORY and SOUL goods came in SPADES, but with a pricetag of confusing storytelling. I know people that understood it the first time around, so it is not bad storytelling. I'm just too stupid to understand all the details. The end was GREAT. I LOVED Neo being the Super Cool guy he was, stopping those machines in dead flight, and going into a coma. Nice, nice, and nice. How Trinity wants to stay with Neo rather than sleep... again, nice. Nice emotion here.What if the prophecy is true? What if tomorrow, the war could be over? Isn't that worth fighting for? Isn't that worth dying for? Morpheus, if Revolutions is even half as good as Reloaded, you bet your ass it is.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is indeed a film that doesn't match up quite to the original (what could, really), but what is breathtaking is how the Wachowskis' feel a confidence, mastery of their medium of sci-fi action storytelling. Even when the film gets all too deep into the philosophical speculations and dialogue (which the first balanced with the action perfectly), it rebounds to get to what the audience wants to see- fights, chases, gun and knife/sword battles, and all the visual effects that can be brought forth in a Hollywood picture.I won't say too much of the plot except that in the second installment we see our heroes, Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity, facing the oncoming of the war with the machines, and how they, and more specifically Neo, will be tested to their limits. These limits make up the sum of the visual effects and action sequences, which are about 60 to 65 percent of the whole movie. And that's what makes the film a worthy watch (not the acting, since it's even lesser than in the first one, as Keanu Reeves proves) is that there seems to be always something to look at, admire, and maybe even dismiss as TOO un-real.Bottom line, The Matrix Reloaded isn't a great movie, like it's monumental predecessor, however it doesn't leave I, as I'm sure it won't leave others, with a sense of money not well spent. As one character said, ""The choice, I leave up to you."" Grade: A","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's more than good. It's an exciting and engaging movie that also sets up the next installment, Revolutions, into what will become (and I hope) the best cinematic orgasm ever. Think of Reloaded as very, very good foreplay. Which is not to say that it is not good. The movie is great and filled with enough action sequences, CGI and cyber-philosophy to make people who loved The Matrix to recall withexcitement their jaw-dropping moments after their first experience with the movie. Reloaded requires more from the audience during the talking parts (which was the common complaints of early reviews over the Internet). I personally find that the psycho-babble works as it sets up Neo with some moral choices (or lack of) that he has to make at the end of the movie. Watch ""The Matrix"" and then ""Animatrix"" for a refresher course. Pay close attention to Animatrix's first installment, ""The Final Flight of the Osiris"" (and I don't only mean the ultra sexy opening fight sequence) as it is a prelude to Reloaded.And finally, don't leave your seat until the very last credit roll if you want a sneak peak of what's happening in the next movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Adding to his troubles is the over bearing people of Zion, who look to him as a prophet to save them. The leaders of all ships are meeting as they have found new startling information. The machines are digging directly down to Zion; reaching in roughly seventy-two hours, but there are other things going on in the matrix. The agents have had an upgrade, but someone has come back; Agent Smith. He has been unplugged from the matrix and has become free, yet he is on a forceful fight to find Neo. Smith has also become able to copy himself; there are hundreds of Agent Smiths now.Neo, Morpheus and Trinity are now on a mission to save Zion, but first have to find the Key Maker; who holds the key to Neo's final destination. Neon has to go to the source of the matrix, where he has to make a choice; save Zion or save the one he loves.The Matrix Reloaded is an full throttle, action packed sequel to The Matrix. The look and feel though is very different though to the first one. The first Matrix had a very dark atmosphere to it; through the dark green and black colours, the green wash is present again, yet its mixed with white and light colours, making a much brighter feel. As the first matrix set up so much of the story, the Wachowski's were given more freedom in incorporate more action to the mix, though it wasn't evenly spread through the movie. At times you were given loads of information, some hard to digest on first viewing, than huge action sequences would follow, knocking out most of the information you just had. The scene between Neo and the Architec seemed over complicated; where the Wachowski's seemed to have swallowed a thesaurus, making it hard to follow the conversation.The special effects are so much better, creating much more detail to the matrix and to the fights. Yet it was disappointing that the burly brawl did have to rely on so much special effects, losing some authenticity where you can see when Neo or Smith were computer generated. The rest of the fights though much more gracefully, flowing much better. The car chase is just mind blowing, being one of the best car chases i have seen. I remember the first view of it and i couldn't breath and my heart skipped beats, it was so intense and moved at such a fast pace and has such a climatic ending that just makes your jaw drop.The acting was as of the same level of the first. At times people seemed to overact, losing some of the dramatic tension. Harry J. Lennix as Commander Lock seemed to gruff and mumble a lot, not making him seem to serious. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss all give good performances again. It is sad that it was Gloria Foster's last performance as the Oracle, which she does great again.It just falls short of the first Matrix, though continues the story and ends on such a high note, keeping you hanging for the final one.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It started slow, but it quickly picked up, and once it got going, it wasn't stopping for anything. The action sequences were great, the story was a great continuation of the first movie, and the acting was perfect for the characters. A lot of people complained about the ""To Be Concluded"" ending, but I think everyone had already heard about this about a year ago, so why the big feeling of surprise all of a sudden? In addition to great action, awesome CGI, a good story and some great funny moments, the movie has a strong root in philosophy, dealing with free will vs destiny, the meaning of life, how love can affect a person, and a general semblance of what makes us human.  So it's a great movie for anyone. If you want to just turn off your brain and watch a lot of cool action sequences, you can do that. If you want a movie with deep themes and symbolism, that's here too. The best part is that you don't have to choose one or the other, because you get both in one easy package. I give it a 10 out of 10, and encourage everyone to see it at least once. I for one will be seeing it at least one more time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

From my own observations of the sequel, The Matrix: Reloaded and The Matrix: Revolutions is one movie.  The only reason why it is split into two separate films is because of the length.  The movie does end rather suddenly and it leaves no conclusion, but that is because the story isn't finished.  I would compare this to a to be continued episode on television.  Only we have to wait a few months to see it.  Remember it does say ""To Be Concluded"" at the end of the film.  Before you go and rate this a 0/10, be open minded and wait to see the actually ending to one long story.  You could say The Lord Of The Rings has a similar ending where it just ends, but at least it has a conclusion to each tale, The Matrix: Reloaded does not.The movie itself wasn't that bad.  I loved the action and effects, and parts of the movie were humorous.  The only scene I disliked was the party scene, it was pointless.  I think the main reason why people will find it a disappointment is because everything in the film has already been done. They can't show us anything new and it's hard to top The Matrix after it was such a huge hit.  Remember it was a huge hit because of it's original ideas and outstanding special effects.  The idea and effects are still in the sequel, it is just something we all have seen before.Overall I'd give this movie a 8/10 compared to The Matrix 10/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Shambles of a movie and comes close to destroying the whole franchise.Matrix revolutions: decent attempt at a rescue, characters play their parts in the plot well, secondary characters are still douchebags but overall a fairly decent flick.In short: watch reloaded because you have to to enjoy the whole story.

I can sum it up and say..4 years...is nothing to wait for a film as beautiful as this.I did not mind the philosiphy as I did not mind it in the first film. The story was a little big confusing but not by much, a second viewing should fix that just fine, which i do decide to do within the next few days.
The action was top notch and once again sets standards. Thou I do belive the beginning scene could have used a little bit more ooomphh, but there was reasoning behind it. Did I find the movie to move at a slow pace from the start ? The answer to this question is no. I enjoyed every minute of it. My favorite scene was not the car chase but the neo vs. smiths. I love the smiths. It is nice to see the Oracle on screen. It makes me realize what a nice lady she is and she will be missed. Now I can't say that this film is better than the first because without the first we would have not had the chance to see this one, so I must pay respect where respect is due. And as for the ending.

And guess what- It is about as far from sucking as anything can be.Action - MIND BLOWING, frequent, and for the most part, EXTREMELY realistic. I nearly dropped a load in my pants during the car chase scene, no joke. This movie is to ""The Matrix"" as ""The Matrix"" was to, well, anything else. I don't think anyone else will ever copy these effects. I don't think anything CAN.Story - Now here, I have to admit, I was a little scared at first. The first half-hour drags a bit, with introductions of all the new and returning characters that feel a little forced, and a massive Zion rave/Neo-Trinity love scene that is overlong and a little gratuitous. Don't worry, though - it doesn't last. Once again, it is a visit with the Oracle that kicks a matrix movie into high gear, and from then on, it's all gold. The philosophical themes of the first Matrix are examined on an even deeper level this time around, and the last 20 minutes will bring new revelations and deeper questions that WILL TWIST YOUR BRAIN LIKE NEVER BEFORE. Repeat viewings are highly recommended.I went home after this movie and was irritated to see the usual slew of TALENTLESS MOVIE REVIEWERS bashing ""Reloaded"". This should come as no surprise, seeing as how most movie reviewers are POMPOUS FOOLS, and NOT WORTH LISTENING TO. Listen to REAL PEOPLE who REALLY KNOW- ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is TRULY AMAZING, and A WORTHY SUCCESSOR to ""The Matrix.""

Too much of the script did not make sense, the dialogue was inane and star performances one note. Jackie Chan does better stunts and fight scenes. Not even a good popcorn movie.....","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

This movie entertained me just as much as the first one did and if the Wachowski brothers had to die tomorrow, they'd still be remembered only for the matrix.In the second movie, we get to see with much more details the greatness of the futuristic world. Set underground, near the earth's core, where the heat is much more high, the human race has managed to build a world I haven't seen in any other movie yet. There are other worlds which resemble a little. The futuristic world of Chrono Trigger (1995) (VG), for example, where you get to see in every sight possible, everything destroyed and the only remains where the humans may still refugee themselves are inside old domes.The main difference between this movie and the next one is that this one focuses a little more on the matrix than the real world and Revolutions does the opposite. For that, many may have disliked the movie, stating that it was less interesting than the others. But the story was almost complete except for one thing: the end of the war must be shown in every way it can be. If the matrix movies focused only on the matrix world and less on the real world, it wouldn't be the same thing. Revolutions saves the trilogy brilliantly.The Wachowski brothers have done it again. The sequels features new characters, more plot improvement, great special effects and many surprises. I loved it!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

What I got was a two hour long movie that I loved just about every minute of.It's true that Reloaded leaves many questions unanswered, but personally all that does is make me more excited to see the next one, and makes me eager to discuss with my friends possible meanings and situations that might arise in the next chapter.As I'm sure everyone is aware by now, this film has received an awful let of negativity, and I really can't understand why. I won't use the token ""people don't understand it"" phrase, because I'm not so sure. I think a lot of people do understand it (and mark my words, there IS a lot to understand), but they must have some sort of profound distaste for a sequel to the Matrix for whatever reason. Maybe they don't like that it has a totally different tone and goal than the first one. Who knows.And, indeed, a different tone it has. There is a lot more open discussion of philosophy in this film, as I'm sure most people are aware, but it's not pretentious in the slightest. People have been harping on lately about how the Wachowski brothers are insulting the intelligence of the movie going public with the way the discussions of causality, choice, and purpose are presented, but I don't think that argument has a single leg to stand on.The dialogue presented is first rate, never is a conversation pointless, and never is a discussion all that it immediately seems to be. There are a number of very interesting new characters brought into the saga, while old favourites remain; the Oracle is still baking your noodle, and this time she's joined in her provocative thinking by the Merovingian, who's purpose I will not divulge because I don't want to reveal anything at all about the plot, or relevant sub-plots. All I'll say is, don't roll your eyes and switch off as soon as you hear his accent. Listen to what he's saying. Think about it. Is he right?So far, this review isn't what you'd expect a review to be. In some ways, this film defies such conventions. It has been said that the first two acts are nothing but violence, and the latter part of the work is too conversation based. This is, to put it bluntly, a lie. Interspersed throughout the film are some fantastic confabulations on such things as destiny, symbiotic relationships, causality, choice, purpose, and the reality of situations presented. There just happens to be a very long one towards the end.It was the choice to do just that that impressed me most about the film. There's a phenomenal amount of meticulously crafted action sequences, which I'm sure everyone was expecting, and then the brothers Wachowski go and turn your world upside down at what is, more or less, the climax of their movie. Pay close attention, things happen very fast.The film was, in some ways, a victim of it's own success before it was even released. People didn't know what to expect with the first one, because it was such a low key release. Now, so many people have so many preconceived ideas of how the Wachowski brothers should make the film they want to see that their minds are closed to anything *but* what they want to see.Consequently, if people went in wanting to see action along with their own ideas of what and how the plot should be and unfold, then they'd accept the action as being good and reject everything else, saying it's simply not good. Free your minds, people. Accept it for what it is, try to understand what it wants you to understand, go with the flow. It wants to present you with some intriguing ideas and conversations. Listen to them. You might just like what you hear.I say most assuredly that a lot of people decided not to like the work before they'd even seen it. I think now is the time for them to try and understand why.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The Matrix Reloaded has some groundbreaking and great fight sequences, yet flawed writing but overall a great follow-up - My Ultimate Review","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7638779/?ref_=tt_urv","Holt344","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur80693802/?ref_=tt_urv","12 December 2021","The Matrix Reloaded is a sequel to The Matrix and the second installment in The Matrix film series. It's again written and directed by the Wachowskis, its their property and work of art after all. Reloaded and Revolutions was shot back-to-back so it's really one story, I don't think it is as great as the first installment, yet an overall good movie. It's hard to top what Matrix was. But what the Wachowskis did well with this installment is the world building as they finally show Zion which is the last surviving human city, once again showing their brilliant storytelling both visually and in writing, I just hoped the writing was better and more refined. They're still ambiguous with the world building and the world though which is a good thing for fans of the franchise. The cinematography is still incredible and it's because Bill Pope returned, it's just phenomenal piece of work done by him.In the second chapter of the Matrix trilogy, Zion falls under siege to the Machine Army. Only hours before 250,000 Sentinels destroy the last human enclave on Earth--and its growing resistance--Neo and Trinity choose to return to the Matrix with Morpheus, unleashing their arsenal of extraordinary skills and weaponry against the forces of repression and exploitation. Now, at the confluence of love and truth, faith and knowledge, purpose and reason, Neo must follow the course he has chosen if he is to save humanity from the dark fate that haunts his dreams.Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss and Hugo Weaving returns as Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and Agent Smith. Whilst newcomers Jada Pinkett Smith, Harold Perrineau, Gloria Foster, Randall Duk Kim, Monica Bellucci portrays Niobe, Link, the Oracle, the Keymaker, Persephone and the Merovingian. Along with a couple of others. These are characters that will play a big role in Reloaded and Revolutions, and they are a welcome addition, both the actors and characters. There are also a couple of good performances but like the previous film, the action sequences are the most interesting part of the performances. Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving and Jada Pinkett Smith are excellent in the action sequences. The eight months training truly paid off.There's plenty of action sequences that are worth talking about, the wire-fu are great as ever and the fight choreography along with how it's shot, the action sequences is brilliant and doesn't disappoint. Following the success of the previous film and how they created some groundbreaking visual effects and sequences. For this film, the Wachowskis came up with extremely difficult action sequences, such as the Burly Brawl, a scene in which Neo has to fight 100 Agent Smiths. Groundbreaking sequence that were entertaining and excellent. But my favorite is the one which has our three heroes against Merovingian's goons as it's practical and just superb work done by the stunt coordinator, using various of weapons, just superb. Then we have the highway sequence, phenomenal from start to finish with tension and suspension and to top it off just the musical score, excellent. Don Davis, who composed for The Matrix, returns to do the musical score for this film and like the previous film, it's great. Zach Staenberg returns to edit the sequel, after receiving an Oscar for the first installment. It's once again great work from him, I just think the pacing isn't the best and it's mostly because of the writing. It isn't brilliant like The Matrix was and I think I know the reason, as the Wachowskis spent a couple of years refining the script of that movie. Meanwhile Reloaded and Revolutions feel a bit rough on the edges, the pacing most of all. It's still a great film with lots of achievement on the technical side.Is The Matrix Reloaded a great follow-up? There's two answers to that question, technically it is but in terms of writing it isn't. Still very entertaining and should be seen by casual viewers and fans as lots of things are expanded upon. I also want to add that rewatching this film made it better as there are a lot more dialogue and exposition, plus the 4K picture and Atmos sound made it amazing. It's a good followup but to be honest, it's quite impossible to outmatch the first Matrix. The Matrix Reloaded is a great action film, that tries to outdo itself and succeeds regarding the action sequences. The visual effects still hold up today and the CGI sequences actually flows well with the live action sequences, edited together perfectly. The film's religious themes are there for a reason and it's smart. Reloaded's ending is smart. I think this is a great follow-up but it will never be better than the original.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Great action, shame about the pretentious dialogue","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704388/?ref_=tt_urv","Axel-9","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0134287/?ref_=tt_urv","24 May 2003","Well I've generally slammed the Matrix on these forums, but I'd admit I did enjoy Reloaded. I think it appealed to me as both a martial arts fan and someone who's done some programming. I would agree with the fact that it is nowhere near as great as some are making it out to be.This is mainly due to the poncey dialogue. At times it is incomprehensible. I have seen many complex films before that I have both understood and enjoyed, but this film takes the piss. So many questions are answered with questions, and it just seems overly pretentious. 'You didn't come here to make a choice you already made that choice, you're here to understand why you made it.' Eh. Talk about answering questions with a riddle. Which is my problem with the dialogue in general. Movie dialogue should add the plot, but should not be the whole plot. Many films can explain things with an image, something I thought worked well in X-Men. You see a shot of Wolverine healing, you've learnt what his powers can do, you don't need 10 lines of dialogue to tell you that. Or in LOTR the shots of the one ring and the pwer it has over everyone, you don't need much more explantion to establish how evil it is. The endless musings on choice become tiresome after the tenth time.The supposed gravitas the lines are delivered with grates too. No sense or attempt is made to be ironic. The same points are just repeatedly rammed home. Are we free to choose, etc. But these are nothing compared to the near insane ramblings about the programming of the matrix. Jees are we all assumed to have an interest in these techy ramblings. I knew trouble was in store when the Oracle started rambling about programs running all over the place and the system assinilating programs. For the love of God. I have a degree in electronic engineering but this talk of anomalies nearly caused my head to explode. Again this is something handled better in the X-men films, especially through Wolverine's eyes as he jokes about the others names. It had a vein of humour to it which is completely lacking in Reloaded. The best blockbusters never take themselves too seriously, just see the likes of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Back to the Future or Ghostbusters for examples.Then there is the relationship between Neo and Trinity, which doesn't exactly sparkle, but I guess they may well be living in a computer game so it's probably hard to get real human emotion from their relationship. And the sex scene was completely unerotic. Are they in love or is he just paying for it, couldn't really tell. Which s why when Persephone asked eo to kiss her like Trinity I couldn't take i hat seriouly. He was hardly that passionate about Trinity in the first place.As for Neo fighting I never seriously thought he'd lose a fight, he's just got far too hard. And if it's all a computer game where's the fun in that. Wolverine can take serious damage, but he does it on Earth under real physics and he's got a human heart with real emotions. Neo is just so unphased by everything, so unemotional, he doesn't seem at all frightened. Yeah he got cut in a fight but he came back at them even stronger. Once he got the sai no-one really layed a finger on him. And the flying did look a bit pants.For a film supposed to be compassionate little thought is given for all the destruction going on, the fact so many people seem to get killed, like during the car chase agents destroy a number of civilian cars. Because it looks good? Doesn't Trinity care that people they are trying to save are getting killed as a result of this.And the finale was very jumbled. What was going on with the two other important missions? Niobe seemed peripheral yet played a significant part taking down the power station. How then? Well you'd have to (like me) play the Enter the Matrix game to learn. That to me is a shameful cash in, where the filmmakers are saying you want the full story then, you'll have to finish the game and watch the animatrix. That's not good cinema as far as I'm concerned. That's cynical marketting.However while the film isn't as smart as it thinks it is it did make me think all the same. Few films do that. And I did think the martial arts choreography was superb, especailly the Agenet Smith fight. I got a genuine adrenaline rush from that. I loved the expression on their faces as Neo flew off, especially the one just left of the centre. The car chase is high quality action cinema, and the sheer intensity of it was different to anything I have seen before. The fight Neo engages in with Merovingian's goons beforehand was superbly done too. The movements were wonderfully fluid and were realistic yet fantastical.It's genrally an entertaining film, certainly if it was judged purely as an action film it's a superior beast, with at least 3 excellent set piece moments. I'd give it six out of ten.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I personally really liked the sequence where they arrive in Zion. An artistic moment which echoes those grand starship arrivals in the original Star Wars trilogy. There are some parts which I think computer programmers relate to a bit more than the general audience. The concept of backdoor hacks in the Matrix is fascinating! I think that calling the meeting place of Zion a Temple and then turning it into a sleazy nightclub was cheap. On the other hand, I think there was an intelligence to the film that will only be realized on future viewings (it was the same for me with the original Matrix.) In fact I think it may contain some of the most eloquent dialogue of any action/sci-fi movie I have seen. Few action sequences make me go WOW, and fewer make me FEEL wow these days. There were two of three of these moments in this film.
However, in some of the action sequences it is obvious that Neo is CG. Takes the edge off the stunt it for me. Bullet-time is sometimes replaced by CG in this film and it doesn't work so well. I have a feeling that perhaps some stunts may have been physically impossible to put bullet-time cameras on, so they had to resort to CG. There is no question that the car chase sequence is better than the motorcycle chase in T2, and the end of that sequence is the one that made me FEEL WOW! As for the deeper plot of the Matrix Reloaded, one can only hope that the questions and seeming flaws are answered in the third film, otherwise the Wachowski brothers will have a lot of very disappointed movie-goers to deal with. It kind of leaves you wanting to see the next one as Fellowship left you wanting the Two Towers. But overall I personally enjoy the context of Lord of the Rings more. Even though this film is very good, if I HAD to choose one more movie to watch in the theatre this year it would be Return of the King.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I saw it on an IMAX screen, which was overwhelming, but the film was boring. There was no further development of plot, or at least nothing that couldn't have been put in the first ten minutes of the next film. I'm certain that the story could have been told in two installments rather than three. The director just wanted to dazzle us with effects, but we've seen it all before. The freeway chase seen went on far too long. Even with the huge screen and overpowering sound, I nearly fell asleep. It takes more than effects to make a good film. No one would have seen this if it didn't have ""Matrix"" in the title.Hopefully, the Matrix Revolutions will be a better film. I feel that I wasted money going to see ""Reloaded"" on the big screen. Unfortunately, I wanted to see it for myself and not trust the opinions of friends who said that they were totally bored during the film. Unless I hear something great about ""Revolutions"", I will wait to see it on DVD, if at all.If you haven't seen this, don't bother.

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but the movie at least attempts to be constantly spectacular or profound. I thought some parts were over-done (some of the speeches were too long, and sort of redundant) but it was interesting to see an action movie with overt references to Kant, Hegel and any number of other philosophers. This movie is a big philosophical set up for the third movie (which will have the monumental task of resolving everything in some sort of consistent way), but on its own it works as an action movie with some positively awesome scenes. I felt a certain degree of exhaustion after 10-15 straight minutes of action, but I think this movie is one you can appreciate even if you don't necessarily understand all the references or like all the action.

If it all goes accordingly in this third movie, they will both gain my full admiration...","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It pretty much takes off where the last film left us and shows us that there is still so much more to be resolved in the story. I wasn't expecting this film to be as innovative as the first (as most sequels are) But it still makes you leave the cinema in deep thought about ""what is the matrix!"". The special effects in this movie are probably the best you'll ever see at this time and the scenes in which they are utilized are worth the admission fee alone. The Kung-fu scenes are also well done although i got the feeling a few times that they went longer than they should have. My main gripe with this film is that the story is is very much dependant on the next installment, and you leave the theatre feeling unresolved. Not bad though.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Morpheous scenes seemed to drag a little due to his overly-long pronouncements and I felt that the car chase was too long, but otherwise it is a good film. I rather enjoyed the closeness that was developed between Trinity and Neo, which broke up some of the plodding of the dialogue. I enjoyed the special effects for the most part. I saw this when it came out in theaters, I don't remember seeing it in IMAx, but I saw Revolutions at IMAX, (its all a blur). When the film trilogy was finished I felt sad, because the drama that I was so drawn into was finished. I think this film is a good mid-way between the first and third, but to be brutally honest, there is no way that Reloaded can compare with the stunning ideas presented in the first Matrix (at least for me.I give it a 10 because the all-too-brief love scene between Neo and Trinity really was great.

However, if you want to be mentally entertained by the many possiblities of future existence (like any true sci/fi fan would) while taking in the latest innovations in visual effects at the same time - then Matrix is for you. You will be excited by the vast scope of possible reality scenarios that are suggested as well as the parallels to various religious beliefs.For those of you who thought there was ""too much talking"" - sorry you didn't get it.

I predicted that the second installment would be akin to Highlander II (OK, I don't think anything could be that bad).There was one slow part near the beginning. I think it could have been shorter but there were some relevant allusions so I can forgive it. It also tied up things a bit.There were some places where I noticed the CGI, but overall all the action was wonderful and the fight scenes were wonderfully choreographed.Some of the revelations were expected; they explained some things from the first movie as well. Near the end we find out more about what ""the one"" is meant to do. Or do we? That's to be determined. Regardless, the plot development from the middle to the end was solid. Some of the dialog could have been better but it was NOWHERE near as bad as the most recent Star Wars.Is this movie better than the first? The shock value of the world being a simulation was not there, but you already knew that. The action sequences were bigger, but you already knew that. The plot development was good, I though better than the first. However, I'm a software developer and I suspect that has a bit to do with why I liked the plot development so much.I'll see it again, but you already knew that.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I tell you all if I tell you anything at all it is this, The Matrix wowed me back when I first saw it. using cutting edge technology with mind blowing effects, and a truly spectacular story that added fuel to the sci fi fire. Though my brother and others may think this movie was disappointing, it was nothing of the sort. It was INCREDIBLE! I won't say anything to spoil you Matrix fans out there, who have yet to see the awesome power of this film. But I tell you it is great. Extended action sequences that totally outclass the first film in every way, new concepts and radical ideas being exploded and explored further and further, eye popping freeze frame battles and explosive scenes that really go beyond mental limitations.Now I must admit there are a few flaws one is reguarding Zion, the other is reguarding the mass complexitity it enduces. But other then that I think everyone will be excellently satisfied with Reloaded. Smith, Trinity, Neo, and all the new players continue their amazing feats in even greater battles then the first Matrix film itself. The battle between Mankind and Machine has never looked so god like. By the way I ADVISE YOU ALL TO STAY AFTER THE CREDITS, I REPEAT STAY AFTER THE CREDITS!

Keanu Reeves gives all to his Neo character and so does the rest of the cast. Once again, the effects, the fight scenes, the CGI and the work done on this film is amazing!! Do Not miss the pioneer of future effects movies!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As a ""filler"" (2nd movie of a trilogy) it has done it's job and has set us up for the finale - revolutions.Sure there were flaws in the arguments and muses that were presented, but guess what -- those arguments have been around for centuries and will continue for generations into the future.if you watch this movie not expecting it to outdo the first, then you will realise how good it really is. remember, the first was unexpected. reloaded was not meant to better the first.. but to continue it's legacy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If the first can be called a science-fiction thriller, then this part can be called an action drama. While the first part pays more attention on the workings, laws and physics of both the virtual and real worlds, the second part pays more attention to the actual world, its last human colony, 'Zion', and its internal politics.In this part, Neo is already quite in control of his immense powers; from the real world newcomer to the Christ-like figure in training, he's come a long way. He's immensely in love with Trinity. Love plays an important role in this part. Other than Neo & Trinity, there's Morpheus' love triangle and Dozer's brother Link's love for Zee. This part certainly has more passion and heat than its predecessor; the orgy-like dance celebration (after Morpheus' announcement) interlaced with Neo & Trinity's love-making scene was quite sensual. And Monica Bellucci's exotic presence and passionate kiss with Mr. Reeves certainly adds to that.Since the first part was such a big hit, they had the tremendous budget to show the machines on a larger scale and give us a proper view of Zion. While the action of the first part was already path-breaking, this part tries to better it by going much more explosive and ambitious; the action sequences are really breathtaking, especially the fight between Neo and hundreds of Agent Smiths, and the incredible chase scene. Other than the action, it also explains few of the questions about the whole system and the anomaly named Leo.Jada Pinkett Smith and Harry J. Lennix are interesting additions to the cast, but Jada has a very small role to play in this one. Together, their characters form an interesting love-triangle with Lawrence Fishburne's Morpheus. Most the authoritative figures in the human colony are black; whether it was intentional, to make a statement, or just a happy coincidence... only the Wachowskis could tell.Overall, an intelligent and action-packed sequel to the terrific first part. After a few revelations in this part, we can certainly predict where the third part is headed to.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was that exciting.  There were about three scenes I personally felt could've been shorter, but other than that, I believe it to be nearly flawless.While leaving the theater, I noticed half the audience engaged in dialogue that began there and would probably continue for days.  The other half were scratching their heads because the film IS NOT JUST EYE CANDY.I admit, I'm not happy with the standard level of entertainment we've been provided for a number of years now.  Movies with ""hype"" turn out to be nothing more than a really good marketing campaign.  It seems to me that PG-13 ""bubble gum and MTV"" audiences are the only audience studios care to please.  It's even to the point now where studios call the movies ""products"" instead of films.  Matrix Reloaded will make money like a product, but will eternally be a film.  Hopefully, the studios will understand that if you'd make a better ""product"" we'd pay more attention.Any intelligent person should at least give this a chance.  If you don't agree with it, fine.  If you don't like it, okay.  But I guarantee it will give you something very interesting to talk about.I give this 9 of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"1","/10","Reloaded is to the Matrix franchise what Reload was to Metallica","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0705105/?ref_=tt_urv","axlroseisgod","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2394290/?ref_=tt_urv","7 July 2003","I remember when I first saw The Matrix. It was a good movie. Heck, it was a great movie. And at the time, no one else was really seeing it. Most people don't remember this, but The Matrix had a relatively unsuccessful box office run. Once it was released on DVD and VHS, it quickly gained a large following.I had my doubts about Matrix II from the moment I heard the title: Matrix Reloaded. Metal fans will know why. In 1997, Metallica released a very uninspired album called Reload. So among my friends the comparison between Reload and Reloaded often came up. But it was only a joke. None of us really believed it. Unfortunately, the comparison was eerily apt.The original Matrix took a premise of Total Recall meets Terminator 2: Judgment Day and made into something brilliant by introducing innovative special effects. Matrix Reloaded, on the other hand, is little more than a mish-mash of CGI effects and convoluted philosophy. As a student of philosophy, I found the film's speeches on hard determinism, fatalism, and free will to be simplistic and boring. The general public might find them confusing. The plot runs out of fuel by the end too. In the climax of the movie, Neo is being explained his role as the chosen one. The speaker starts off by saying ""Some of this you'll understand, some of it you won't."" However, the speech is *supposed* to explain crucial plot elements to the audience as well as help setup the third movie. When the scene ends, no one will fully understand what just happened. One of final scenes of the movie is incredibly bizarre. Neo saves his friends in a manner that needs to be seen to be believed. But if you want it explained, you'll have to wait for Matrix Revolutions.Matrix Reloaded, to me, is a sci-fi/action movie. The sci-fi elements of the movie are somewhat flawed, but there's enough twists to keep things interesting. The movie flat out fails in the action department. There is absolutely no sense of suspense. Presumably, you've all seen the trailers. Neo fights hundreds of Agent Smiths at once and flies around like Superman. In fact, Neo has become very much like Superman: unstoppable and boring. In the first movie, Neo was an everyday guy who had to learn to deal with the reality that the world he knew was just an illusion. And he had to learn to fight back. In Reloaded, he doesn't even bleed. Plus, most of the fight scenes are CGI. Supposedly, Keanu Reeves got injured during the filming and that delayed the release of Reloaded. I don't see why. Reeves did little to no actual fighting.Here's a few other problems with The Matrix:1. (The former Agent) Smith's role is unclear. He's intent on killing Neo for no real reason. Perhaps a deeper purpose will be revealed in Revolutions.2. Carrie Ann Moss looks NASTY in this movie. If you didn't know better, you'd think Trinity was a transsexual.3. They included an inappropriate & pointless rave scene that panders to the burned out E-heads and potheads who became fans of the first movie.4. The movie has too many characters for its own good. Some characters were blatantly thrown in so that they could be developed later in Revolutions.5. In 138 minutes, surprisingly little happens. The movie raises more questions than it answers, and pretty much forces you to see Revolutions for any kind of satisfactory ending. A good movie should invite a sequel, but stand on its own. Reloaded fails to do this.I tried to give this movie another chance, but I fell asleep during it during this second viewing. The only other movie I have ever fallen asleep during in a theater is the CGI crapfest Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.
The Matrix was supposedly designed as a trilogy. It's hard to believe that The Wachowski Brothers had this snorefest in mind when they were shooting The Matrix. Heck, it's hard to believe that Reloaded had any script at all.
Final word: This movie is terrible, but don't let that stop you from seeing it. There's still a vacant hope that Matrix Revolutions will be good, and the 3rd installment won't make sense if you didn't see Reloaded. However, if you'd like to see a sci-fi/action movie that will actually entertain you, opt for X2: X-Men United or Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines.Final rating: 1.5 out of 4 stars","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The fight scenes in this sequel are much better than part 1, but the plot is just equal.  The storyline gets very complicated and ends with a cliffhanger, therefore one must see part 3 (Revolutions) to find out what happens in the end. One thing though is that there is a ""love"" scene that I feel is not too appropriate for younger viewers.  This movie is rated R and is definitely made for the mature audience only. Few people dislike this movie because they say it has lack of storyline, philosophy, etc.  However I think it just depends on the audience/viewer to decide what makes a good movie.  To me, it has all the qualities of a great movie and I really enjoyed watching it.  I recommend it to all those (older audience) who want to enjoy a good action/scifi movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

(Seriously. Yep, I've probably raised the box office a few million dollars just by saying that...) Now it's important to understand that The Matrix Reloaded is not an orgasmically good movie. It is not as good as X2 and falls a little behind the first Matrix. This movie has its share of problems, but rest assured, this is still one helluva mind-bending action sci-fi movie. The movie starts slow and doesn't really pick up speed until Neo goes to see The Oracle, and then the movie runs on full tilt with the awesomely cool Agent Smith fight sequence (or should I say Agent Smiths...). But then the movie slows down again with the wholly unnecessary French guy and keymaker sequences (starring the wholly unnecessary French guy and keymaker). But then the unbelievably awesome freeway chase scene begins and the movie runs on full tilt again, and it doesn't slow down until the cliff-hanger ending that guarantees you will be in line to see The Matrix Revolutions in November. Overall, The Matrix Reloaded turns out to be a damn good show that I would well recommend seeing. If it weren't for a slow beginning and a completley annoying and unnecessary couple of scenes (and characters), this movie would get a perfect 10. But instead I give this movie an 8 out 10, but a well-earned 8 out of 10. I would see it again just for the Agent Smiths fight sequence and the freeway chase sequence, two friggin' awesome instant classic action sequences. This movie is definetley worth seeing at least once, and maybe even worth buying on DVD (but make sure you've bought the first Matrix first).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What was for instance the reason for Neo to fight a crowd of agents when he could have flown away at any moment?

There was no doubt in my mind that it would require a blow to the head with a wrecking ball for even the most insipid simian to claim this film had any value.I suppose I should feel good that my arrogance and superior nature are not without reason.The entire film, written around three tediously long action scenes, had all the originality and intrigue of those ""Ad-lib"" books I played with in third grade (you know, the ones where you fill in nouns, verbs and adjectives to make your own version of the story; frought with hilarity and expletives). The famous ""pole scene"" about which all the sheep were crying ""baa-ram-yoo"" with such fervor afterwards was so prolonged and repetitious that I could have safely used the restroom and come back to find that I'd missed nothing but an opportuinity to lose minutes I will never again be able to use for more worthwhile things.While I expected, going into a sequel to an eye-candy action flick (and, before you cry ""Philistine!"" and start collecting the torches and pitchforks, I did love the first movie), bad writing, I thought perhaps the directing, or at the very least the editing, would make up for it. However, with absolutely nothing either innovative or even vaguely artistic in a single scene, I was left wondering if perhaps I'd wandered into a dress rehearsal for the film.The effects were obscenely expensive without being at any time impressive. I saw some of the most expensive cheese to which I've ever been exposed on the screen during that movie. It looked like Ed Wood got his hands on $100 million dollars.There is no point in analyzing the acting in this film. If you did not shudder at the idea that these people make more than most do in a lifetime for being unrealistically talentless, there is no getting through.My favorite oversized wool sock that they yanked over the collective audience head was the end. Just to make sure that those who walked away liking the movie felt that they'd understood something ""intu-lek-shul"" they forced the word ""ergo"" from the lips of an erudite looking old white man more than once. There are people out there who think they know something because they liked a movie with one SAT word buried in it.One final thought: When the hell did MTV's ""The Grind"" make its sweaty way onto the silver screen? What the hell was that house party all about?","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I went into the theater expecting to see a somewhat cheezy movie that would mimic something along the lines of Superman or another ""Superhero"" type movie, Instead we were treated yet again to a very thoughtful and certainly thought provoking Sequel. The Fight/Chase scenes in this movie are wonderful... The CG for the Fight scenes is done MUCH MUCH better than it was in Blade 2, where the characters are almost weightless looking and move much too fast and papery (like paper doll cut outs) Here they seem to really have mass and react so well together. I give this Movie 10/10 for the Fight Sequences and at least that again for the story and plot... the Acting is a little rough but who really cares with this type of movie... Heres to the next one! if it's half as good as this one then it'll still be great!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Since I believe this movie is just as good as its sequel, I will back up my statement.  The first Matrix put brand new ideas (at least to me) into the world as we used to know it.  There were ideas that were so convincingly shown in the first one, you see, like us being used as a battery and also humanity would bring armaggedon.  Now, many people I know were disappointed that the sequels did not put any new ideas into their heads.  They were disappointed that all the answers were not given to them.  My question for them was: ""why?""  Wasn't the original idea enough to delve on in the first place?  And besides, since when did humans ever get the entire idea of something.  Why don't we just ""choose"" what we think is behind all these ideas?  After all, our free will gives us ""purpose,"" right?  So, my theory is that the Wachowski brothers decided to replace a lot of the philosophical elements with pure and hard-core action (some of the best I've ever seen).  This element works almost perfectly in the sequels.  So, you see, die-hard fans of the Matrix trilogy, just because you aren't given the same amount of philosophy that there was in the first one, there's more than enough that's left-over from the first one. I love this movie.  9/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As a result he is an all powerful superman in the Matrix. So then why does he engage in all these ineffectual and interminable slap-fest kung-fu fights? He ought to win each encounter in a nanosecond. We shouldn't even be able to see a fight - Neo ought to be altering the underlying code to his advantage directly, without any visual corollary. Furthermore, once Neo's powers are discovered, he should be the only human going back into the Matrix. None of the other characters needs to be there at all. It is as though the directors bestow omnipotence on this character, only to have him operate at 1% of his ability throughout the movie. If the Wachowski's had tried to make an intelligent sequel, one that was consistent with Neo's powers, they would have had NO ACTION SEQUENCES at all. But of course this isn't an intelligent sequel - it is just a stupid and long commercial for sunglasses, Cadillacs and Ducatis. This movie is a failure on a par with the Star Wars prequels.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I realized just how much the Wachowski Brothers must have been thinking ahead.  If you watch the scene where the Agents take Neo into their office to interogate him after capturing him in the Metacortex offices, you will notice that their lead into the scene by showing several TVs showing several Neos in the same room sitting at the same table.  They are in fact, the same TVs that are in the Architect's room in the Matrix Reloaded during the Architect's scene.  Given the fact that the Architect's scene shows that the Architect does watch over Neo we can conclude that this scene in ""The Matrix"" implies that the Wachowski Brothers knew during the making  of the first movie, at least the plot of the second one.  So it wasn't all just ""thrown together"" and ""without plot"" as a lot of people commenting on this board seem to think.  There is definate thought process going on.  In my opinion, the Wachowski Brothers are indeed men with vision and high intellegence.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What a lot of people don't understand is this is not your typical movie trilogy. It's more like a 6-hour movie broken up in three parts. The intro, the climax and the conclusion. I've heard some refer to it as a serial rather than a trilogy.Loaded with philosophical hidden meanings and a very complicated plot, some people may not like it purely out of confusion. I know I wasn't totally clear at first myself. A lot of big words, although fitting, seemed a bit much at times. I was beginning to think I should have brought my dictionary along. All in all, it wasn't so confusing I couldn't follow what was going on, but it would have been nice if they had simplified some parts just a little.The action was incredible. I was a bit disappointed with some of the fight scenes due to the obvious use of CG but it was still greatly enjoyable. It didn't have the wow factor of some of the scenes from the first, but there were certain parts that still had my jaw dangling open.
Altogether a great time. I suggest you drain your bladder before you go in and don't blink. You're going to be hit from all sides with a lot of information. Hang out at the end to see a preview of the next movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In fact, I just about busted out laughing a couple of times. For one thing, the dancing scene was so off the wall it was funny. BTW, why is it that men always have hairless chests in movies these days? Is that some kind of rule now? The dialog was so full of technobabble I wondered if refugees from Star Trek had infiltrated the screenwriters. All you can do is chuckle at some of that stuff.Once you get past those things, and the fact that the actors spent more time on floating on wires than any other 10 movies, its not so bad, even fun. The action sequences play out well, good music, and the movie has a great style, even allowing for the carefully dirtied clothes that they wore in between the forays onto the surface. They had some very cool sunglasses. Monica Bellucci makes any movie worth watching, even if she's in Reloaded for only a few minutes.Watch this movie just for fun and style statements and its not bad at all.

Where so many other franchises have been sold out and turned to crap (Star Wars, Batman), these guys have maintained a level of integrity and quality that keeps The Matrix: Reloaded in the same ballpark as the original, despite their having set the bar so high to begin with.I agree with another reviewer that Reloaded lacks the mystery of the first movie, which is unfortunate and inevitable, but makes up for it with top-notch elements of what makes moviegoing so much fun: action, interesting characters, a good plot, intriguing dialogue/philosophical expression, and simply stunning cinematography. Even the ""slow"" sequences of the movie were worthy, by virtue of being beautiful art.What impresses me so much about these movies is the seamless blend of breathtaking action sequences with what turns into a smorgasboard of different philosophical takes on the meaning of existence and what makes us human. The Matrix franchise is as shallow or deep as you want it to be, but what's refreshing is the fact that you're invited to ponder more than just Trinity's leather or Neo's trenchcoat and sunglasses. You're given the red pill/blue pill option to question your very presence on earth.For the takers of the blue pill, Reloaded rocks on pure energy and style. As nothing but a sensory feast, this movie is fan-fugu-tastic.For the takers of the red pill, there is said adrenaline rush, plus the added bonus of thoughtful and intelligent narrative that makes The Matrix: Reloaded more than just stunning fluff.I give it a 9.5","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Regardless to say, I was right..The Matrix gave you such a powerful feeling of ""the Matrix""; it felt so alive in the first film, mostly because you could see ""normal"" people and it felt very ""real"" in a special way. You could see people working in offices, homeless people, real policemen. In this movie, you get a ""faceless"" driver which after 1 second of cameratime changes to an agent.. *sigh*In ""the Matrix Reloaded"", you don't really get any sort of feeling of anything at all, and especially not the Matrix vs ""the real world"". The Matrix is here just a playground where everything you see, is very extreme: Freedom fighters, agents, cars and explosions.You actually get to see one - 1 - ""normal"" person's view of extreme events. Why not use this more? A LOT MORE! Even though the Matrix is fake, the Matrix-viewpoint was the whole attraction of the previous film. I am of the personal opinion that if you build the tension starting with the small, common details, the heavy effects and big explosions become far more effective. That's why the previous movie worked.This is also why this movie would have sorely needed a ""rescue someone else from the Matrix""-scene. It would give you a solid look into other people in the Matrix and their daily life, and a reexperience of a person's extraction from the Matrix. Also how for instance Neo reacts to seeing someone else exit the Matrix. How could they (the W brothers) skip the ""year 2000 common people"" aspect to such a degree? Back then, they made an excellent action movie, and also hit a nerve in our society today by including ""people like me"". Did they not watch their first film at all??The Zion-scenes weren't very good; I can't stand to look at masses being seducted by a speaker, especially with such tame speeches. The masses act really, really, unnatural, and react the same way. There are very few ""real"" people there; even though their clothes are ragged and torn, they are so thinly described it reminds you of a B- movie. I've been to many raveparties, and it doesn't look like this.. some great music though.Yes, Trinity and Neos romance is very awkward - I don't think they fill each other out very well - they are too alike physically and mentally. It's just very unlikely two persons like this would fall in love. They seem to have no humour in their relationship, they don't show real joy in seeing each other, they're just ""dramatically in love"".The movie's greatest moments are Neo's re-encounter with Agent Smith (who is perhaps the movie's most powerful/well-played character in addition to the Oracle), and some fascinating revelations to the plot which I won't mention here.PS: The highway scene had a few cool moments, but wasn't as exhilarating as people would want you to think. 7/10 (Matrix: 10/10)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Reloaded does it even better this time around, and still manages to hold a very deep story. In the first Matrix we were blown away when we found out just what the matrix was, now prepare to be blown away after learning more of the secrets of the matrix and all the programs it holds. Also prepare to be blown away by some of the best fight sequences ever, including one scene where Neo faces over 100 agents at once, all by his lonesome.
My only real complaints on the movie were the ridiculous overacting by larry fishburne, and the overly long and drawn out rave scene. Other than that, this movie definitley lived up to the hype I had seen, and has made a worthy sequel. I can't wait for the next Matrix.9/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Just when you thought it was safe to re-enter the Matrix, they pull the rug from underneathe us. Just when you think you've worked it all out, those mischievous brothers do it again. Of course the element of surprise is gone... they know that... the weight of expectation weighs heavily.In the original we smiled, we grinned and we nodded at references to Alice, to Christ, to reincarnation, to dreams and to Zion. Intermingled with all these we saw Kung-fu, guns-a-blazing and some pioneering special effects. All which should have warned us that the rabbit hole could go much deeper. Fools that we were, we thought that was all...I'm not sure what the fans were expecting. From the polarised comments I've seen written I suspect they didn't know either... Personally I had no idea what I was in for. I tried not to speculate too much and was pretty mindful of ""sequelitis"": The Matrix would afterall be a tough act to follow.Generally, I approve of the results... the Neo/Smith encounters, extended fight scenes, the adrenalin pumping freeway melee (it does take the car chase to new heights of destruction), the numerous doors, the gatekeeper, the Twins. The other stuff that we loved was there as well: The Oracle, the Agents, the mindblowing eye candy and the philosophical babble. Sometimes it is a trite pretentious but always fun... at times very tongue-in-cheek.Admittedly the sex/rave scene threw me... I could have lived without it. I understand why they've put it in there but I don't particularly like it. In a mechanistic, programmed world -- it seems that unbridled passion is the last bastion of human spontaneity. Oh yes, I understand that... but I still think it was just too intense and too long just the same.I somehow doubt that we're supposed to take it all very seriously. The title ""The Matrix Reloaded"" should give us a clue to that. A clever title with a double entendre. The enslavement of humanity that the previous film speaks about runs much deeper and takes a much more sinister tone. The Brothers take a different tact with this one and all that appears to be isn't all over again. Hardly flawless... but always engaging. A bold effort.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie is that good. If you liked the first Matrix, you'll love Reloaded. The Wachowski brothers have created an excellent movie that will surely live on in the minds of sci-fi fanatics for a long while. The movie starts out with a bang and doesn't stop blowing you away until the end. There is more action here than you can possibly handle in one movie (especially the Neo vs. Smiths fight). The story weaves a magnificent puzzler that'll keep you thinking, just the fashion of the Wachowskis. I don't want to get too much into the plot, but let me just say that it answers a lot of questions that spawned from the first movie, and leaves the same amount, if not more, to be answered in the next installment, due in theaters this November. The special effects are dazzling, setting a new standard that will be hard to beat. Remember how so many movies started to rip off The Matrix after it released? Well, not many movies are going to do that anymore, simply because they just can't, with all the high-cost effects and all. The cast was great, but you couldn't help but feel that the script felt too...well, scripted. It didn't make me feel for the character that much because it sort of gave away that it was just a movie. Anyone looking for a thrill this summer should definitely watch this movie, as it will leave you on the edge of your seat. And now that it's out on IMAX, it's even better!Final Score - 9.75 / 10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This film along with all great films of any genre are why I went to New York lived like a slob , and went into debt to go to film school. I like films based on content not the budget, this film just happens to have both. Most, not all, of the complaints are just lame. If you don't like the ""RAVE"" scene fine, but how can you hate a whole film based on one sequence? If this were how I judged films I would never go to the movies. I agree with alot of people in that no matter what the directors did a group of people would hate it. This is not uncommon in huge hyped-up films. People build up their own image of what they want to see and when it doesnt happen they have a nervous breakdown. I mean to give this film a 1 out of 10 is both childish and idiotic. Hollywood releases at least 75% crap and to put this film in that catagory is again idiotic. So, Reloaded is about the same as The Time Machine, Planet of the Apes(new version), or The Fifth Element?If you like those films great, but to me they are total crap but I still would not give them 1 out of 10. I must say I am not a fan of these new Matrix fanatics just as I am not of the Star Wars. Please listen to me ""GET A LIFE!"" Now I'm hearing rumbling's about T3, and The Hulk. These films haven't even come out yet. From now on I will not listen or should I say let these so-called fans of cinema frustrate me with their juvenile reveiws and ranting's. I read a reveiw of MR where this guy backs his hatred for MR by saying 30% of those who have seen it hate it. First how does he know that? And second, any film maker would be more than happy with a 70% approval rating. In closing Matrix Reloaded is much more multi-dimensional than the first, I don't care what anyone say's. It is a perfect second act in a trilogy bound to be a classic! 10 out of 10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

ONLY IF you understand the movie totally and then think it does not deserve a very high rating and NOT because ... you simply did NOT understand the movie at all in the first place so it irritated you and you did not like it.Remember, it may really be a masterpiece like this one movie, valued down only due to YOUR incompetence.Plot: We're into a very, very futuristic life on earth to the extent that there is almost no life existing on the earth surface due to the Big War between Artificially Intelligent Powerful Machines who have taken control of themselves and us humans. The Former have taken the latter as slaves. And using humans as a source of their requirement for energies. But in order to ensure that the slaves don't rebel, the Machines create a Virtual Reality atmosphere called 'The Matrix' that represents a version of the 20th century and it wraps the humans with the Matrix so that the poor humans think everything is going on fine with them and everything is perfect in their universe. But soon, humans find out that the universe was far too perfect for their liking albeit only subconsciously and so the Machines consider that all humans might rebel which may result in non-yielding or 0 % efficiency of energy creation because humans are the source of energy after all. So the Machines create a new Matrix but NOW it also contains a separate space for the rebel humans, if any present, that they can use as a haven/ home for themselves called ''The Zion'. These Rebels in Zion are provided with an aim to find 'The One' (the Anomaly) who will be their leader and the only one to defy the Matrix. But their's a twist. The aim is also provided by the ... Machines ! ... thus creating an illusion for the humans again. And the Machines can regularly keep cleaning the Zion off the rebels whenever they want to. Also the Agents are nothing but some Infecting Viruses injected into the Matrix by the Machines themselves. Each Version of the Matrix has its own version of the Anomaly (Neo). In this movie, Neo, finally, has the two choices: 1. Returning to the Matrix but which will result in the destruction of all humans. 2. Allowing to clean the Zion and refilling it. Of course, his power of choice is too an illusion created by the Machines again. He in fact can only 'choose' the second one.Oh! I really love this Matrix series! Far too intelligent! It overestimated its audience! My Opinion: Perhaps this is the only SECOND perfect example of any masterpiece after Kubrick's/ Steven Spielberg's 'Artificial Intelligence(2001)' to be voted down by some people NOT because they did not like it BUT because they did not like it since they did NOT understand it in the first place. And this opinion comes from a movie-crazy fan like me who has done a Physics Major and works in the field of Software. It is the various Technical Theories in this masterpiece that some people could not properly interpret and digest. And this makes some movie-fans go crazy and bring the rating down because: 1. it challenges their IQ that fails to stand up to the required criterion set by movies like these. OR 2. They have enough IQ but are simply too lazy to put efforts to grasp movies like this. (At the time of me writing this, this is overall rated 7.0 which is not bad but still it deserves a NINE.) The Matrix Series is the Second most Ultimate Masterpiece in the Sci-fi Criterion, only AFTER 'Artificial Intelligence(2001)' which perhaps is one of the Best Masterpieces in cinema history. All these movies are better than '2001: A Space Odyssey'. The technicalities depicted in this intelligent film (...And I am not talking about the visual/sound effects of the movie) can be only be grasped (not totally but still...) by those in the engineering fields especially Software, Robotics and Electronics, basically anyone from the field of Artificial Intelligence. This movie is made for people like us. People like us don't care if this movie becomes the Greatest Blockbuster of all time or not. Simply because this movie satisfies us.What to Expect:If you are a fan expecting that a sci-fi movie ONLY means black leather, Ray-Bans, bullets, guns, explosions, ruthless man-killing robots and mind-boggling action scenes, then ... this IS the movie for you. And a lot of Stunning Visual Effects Extravaganza. PLUS a very,very intelligent plot line.Ironically, this is movie has not been made keeping the ordinary non-technical movie loving public in mind even though it IS concerned with the long-range future of all human beings.Also only two types of movies never win any Oscars: 1. The 'Razzie trash' types that don't go well with the critics because they are way below the IQ of the critics and hit below the belt. 2. The 'Artificial Intelligence' types that don't go well with the critics because they are WAY ABOVE the IQ of the critics. This movie belongs to the second category.The more times you watch this series, the more you learn.For me, perhaps the Best Sci-fi movie ever made till date, is the most realistic practical scientific movie: 'ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE(2001)' which gets a 10 out of 10.But since this, the Matrix Series and the Terminator(1 and 2) series contain some Time and Space warping events that are a little too futuristic even by today's technology standards, I subtract one star from their ratings and give them both: 9 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Any action movie that can create as much tension using dialogue as with special effects is simply amazing. But all that aside, reloaded is a stunning achievement.

People have written philosophy books on the first film!!  They thought they were going to see 138 minutes of non-stop action.The movie makers should be happy with the crowd reaction, gasps, cheers and laughs when called for.One scene that could be trimmed down (you will know it when it happens), but that is not much to complain about.Overall, a very exciting set up for part 3.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Or maybe it is because of the complete lack of pace and the haphazard way in which the film was edited together. The special effects were no better than in the last film and didn't woo me the way the original Matrix had, in fact most of the fight scenes and especially the car chase seemed completely and utterly pointless.The acting wasn't anything special with each character over doing it by a huge margin always trying to speak with a monotone voice as if that would make the audience take them more seriously. I guess I was expecting something a little deeper instead of a typical Hollywood cheesed up special effects roller coaster ride. I wanted an extra deep storyline, instead I got a film for 14 year old boys and testosterone driven 20something men. Better luck next time.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I was very content with this film as I tried to look at it not only as a change in story, but also as a change in genre, and because of that, it did not disappoint me as it did to so many people.I didn't know exactly how to put this feeling into words until I saw 'the Animatrix' (if you have not seen it, go see it, it changes your perspective on the two films entirely) the change in style of every individual story is exactly what the Wach. Brothers did for the Matrix. Of course the superficial style did not change, but the way of telling the story did. Instead of using the same formula all over again, this film made less appeal to the viewers own mind (compared to 'the matrix') and was a more laid out, black on white story of happenings. Different, still interesting, and therefore admirable.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Matrix is known for the craziness and the big illusion-confusion, and this film did deliver the same Matrix things like in the previous. The plot was as holding as the first one, very gripping, with good plot twists and sudden changed that really makes me say ""wow!"" every ten minutes. The Wachowski Brothers did deliver a second fantastic movie that makes a great mix of sciene fiction and action-adventure, and all of that computer-like things and the iconic Matrix theme coming, this just couldn't almost get any better. Now I will tell you what makes this movie good besides the plot, iconicness, and much more. I will tell you also, what they could have done better. Action sequences was very well done. A fast-motion mix with sudden slow-motion, were everything suddenly zoomed in with great dynamic camera angles, and so well visuals and effects, everything made it great, included the amazing martial arts tricks, fun kung-fu fights and cool trick shot improvements. Sometimes I feeled the visuals were to extreme, not too much, but not to less either, just something in the middle. Sometimes I feeled it was just too much, even if that wasn't a big problem, because that was very rare it happened. Besides what I liked, I think the including of more villains at the same time makes the story more interesting, and they did it here. Several villains from every corner, and the movie did include also some side-stories just to spice up a little. Agent Smith came back, unexpected for me, and just great again, they did deliver good surprises. Very great, I think I have mentioned everything, so to conclude: Did you like the first Matrix film as I did, you should definitely watch this one. Delivers great elements, and this was just a worthy sequel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was so cheesy, so over done, and so poorly acted that I left the theater in a state of hysteria wondering how the hell so much could go wrong in a film. The fight scenes were way to long and looked very, very corny. They could of cut them each by at least 20 seconds, as in most of them, there were many opportunities to kill the bad guy (s) that weren't taken. They used big words in long monologues to cover the fact that they weren't really saying anything. And the reason the Matrix Reloaded was so complicated was because if you really think about it, none of it really makes sense. Who gives a damn what reality is? If there is one Matrix, why can't there be two or three? (As we find out, there were really six). And at least in ""our reality,"" ""we"" don't have to spend ""our"" lives running and fighting agents in another reality with plugs stuck in our heads. The whole movie an oxymoron written by morons. And all those metaphors involving the names of people and the ships and all that B.S. makes watching this movie like opening a heavily locked box to find that nothing is there.

If it is to decide whether or not you are going to go see Matrix: Reloaded, then your decision is already made.  It is simply up to you to understand it.If you've already seen this movie, then my opinion on it will matter very little to you.  Clearly this is the sort of movie that people develop very strong, specific feelings for, and that effect makes my opinion, as Smith would say, irrelevant.Nevertheless, here they are.  I thought this movie was very good.  The first question most people ask who have not seen this movie is, ""Was it better than the first?""  I invariably answer, ""It was different.""  I think that is an accurate assessment.The stunt scenes were fantastic, if you like that sort of thing. Personally, the high octane Kung Fu scenes make me giddy, so I loved large chunks of this movie.  My girlfriend thought they were long and tedious -- who you are will dictate how you feel about this movie.The plot was a surprise.  I was expecting a continuation of the previous story.  It's not.  I was pleasantly surprised by the imagination shown by the Wachowski brothers.  Although, I must admit, the Kung Fu was enough to make me happy.This movie is not as concise and neat as the first movie.  The pacing, dialogue, storyline and acting are all better in the first movie.  That does not make this one inferior necessarily, as the action and scale of this movie were far more epic.It is certainly not a masterpiece.  Very few movies are.  I do believe it will make you think, and if you got a charge out of the Kung Fu from the first movie, you'll appreciate large portions of this one.  But does any of that really matter?  You're going to go see it because... well, as I said, that is for you to understand.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","'The Matrix Reloaded' - overwhelming by ambivalence","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0703590/?ref_=tt_urv","Arjan O Welles","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1702769/?ref_=tt_urv","16 May 2003","Okay let's cut the crap: if we want to compare ANY sequel of the original movie with the original we will be disappointed in each and every way. It is simply not possible to make a comparison. 'The Matrix' (1999) set a revolutionary new way of filming and shooting special effects, unlike anything we have seen before. It combined a truly complex nifty story with Asian martial art, motion capture techniques and a comic air.'The Matrix Reloaded' is more of the same and more of new things. The latter however also provides the movie's weak point. In 'The Matrix' (the first one that is) not a single second of screentime was wasted on gibberish totally unnescessary story development. It is a shame to say 'Revolutions' does have those unwanted elements. The movie starts pretty spectaculair with what seems to be a prophecy of Neo (Keanu Reeves) who has further developed his talents having become the cookie baking oracle he visited in 'The Matrix' himself. But after that 'Reloaded' and especially its storyline eagerly trying to find a new approach and let's face it: is hopelessly fails to do so. The lovestory between Neo and Trinity (duh!) rather falls out of place when you realize what important matters are going on in the real world, when machines are trying to tear down the last human city of Zion. Same goes for the other useless dialogues that take place in Zion between crewmember and the homefront. And lots of the new characters like the white rasta twins, Merovingian and Persephone as well as Niobe - played by completely untalente actress Jada Pinkett are either completely useless unless their presence will make more sense in the third installment, 'Revolutions'.What made 'The Matrix' so special was the totally new approach and personally the most interesting scenes took place in the matrix itself, the virtual non-existing world in which man is manipulated by machine. 'Reloaded' shows much more of the real world and of Zion, as promised in the first movie, but the scenes in the matrix are much more interesting, yet too few.  Why: because it combines superpower and impossible things with a world we are all familiar and aware of. Some of the scenes and special effects as seen in that world are even more amazing and breathtaking than in 'The Matrix'. In that sense the movie is a decent and respected follow-up to the initital film. The scenes with an overly duplicated agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) are amazing and so is the 15 minute highway chase. The transitions between real actor to computer-generated actor are astonishingly good (much better than let's say: 'Spider-Man').Some of the stort-elements however have taken away the magic of the concept of the movie. Neo is literally capable of almost anything. His lack of knowledge of his talents and gifts that were so eminent in 'The Matrix' provided much of the charm in the first movie. That all is gone now. This review is much of a comparison with the first movie - of which I am aware - but hey: it's a sequel. part two of a trilogy.Don't expect the same vibe as the first movie. It is admirable the Wachowsky brothers did not simply lift on the success of the first movie. But this is however, not a guarantee that 'Reloaded' is a better movie. What is clear however (and let's hope I am more than right about that) that 'Reloaded' is an intermezzo and that the real excitement is yet to come: 'The Matrix Revolutions' scheduled for release this November.By Arjan Welles","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Will be seeing it again asapMy grips with the downer reviews: How can people be moaning about it being more of the same? its a continuation of the first film. If you  were watching one film and suddenly half way through it completely changed you'd all be complaining about that. Why complain about a 10 minute love/(dance) scene in a 138 minute action movie? It's an action movies (one of the best ever made) of course there's lots of action.So the dialog is a little jilted - it suppose to be, that's what you get in comics, and that's what makes it so much fun; the character polarisation you get only in fantasy. A good example of this is how they dress, all the 'normal' people in the matrix dress normally, then this black leather, long coated trio walk into the frame. It's like they wearing super hero costumes, wonderful.So why so great. When it happens you don't expect it: the Agent Smith Transformation, the 'end film' plot twist, the Oracle's guardian, the Architect. Yet the familiarity stays.Cross synergies with the Matrix, Turning Agent Smith into the very thing he accuses humans of being; a virus, brilliant. Neo's chat with the Architect, against his first chat with the Oracle.The single best fight action sequences ever filmed, though a little long the '100 Agent Smith fight' is incredible. Good luck everyone else topping this for a while.The best car/bike chase conceived and executed. As a 'biker' that chase had me grinning ear to ear. The chase was stunning the camera angles/views amazing.The techno babble, I couldn't stop grinning when the Architect got going.The plot twist was totally unexpected (a good thing) and perfect. How they are going to resolve it ?

ALL of it. afterwords i had to ask a few questions - (since i do think there's a few things that you need a gorgeous computer geek to inform you of!) - and once they were answered i slowly let a smile form on my face. i loved it. not just loved it, but LOVED  it!!! matrix had finally gotten hold of me and showed me it's world. its a new way of filming. the brothers are geniuses.now i've updated you on my background of the matrix let me tell you about the second one!if you havn't seen the frist one, don't even bother reading on! you won't get it at all!!! (you people can stop reading now!!!)if you have seen the the first one, then there's still no point in reading on(!) coz, whatever you learnt form the first film you are told that maybe none of it is true!you have to question the characters you trust. you enter the cinema with questions and you leave with no questions answered, but even more questoins to ask! as for the plot its amazing. i'd say its better than the first matrix coz this one you know the characters so you can develop them more. there are lots of characters to go crazy over-they're all amazing and all so relevant to the plot. another bonus form the film is, this one has humor! coz even the brainiest of computer geeks will have to admit, it can be quite over-bearing; there's a hell of a lot to think about. so, the humour kinda breaks it up.keep your eye out for: 1. burly brawl (-absolutely amazing!) 2. the car/highway scene (-where do you look first!?! there's so much to take in, so much to get over excited aobut...AAAH!!!) 3. the twins...wow! 4. the end. (won't give anything away...but...i think the best ending in film history for quite a while!) 5. the beginning...the middle...agent smith...neo...trinity...morpheus going crazy...the list goes on...!!!seriously now guys, i really don't get why a lot of people are slating it. the ONLY solution i can come up with is, you don't understand it! hey...calm, down!i dont blame you. theres a LOT to think about. but, thats why this film is worth your pennies. this film isn't just 2ours of greatness; it's days, weeks, months! you're gonna be thinking about this film until A) you understand it! OR B)you see the 3rd one!now. to all of you who have seen it and don't like it too much: ask yourself 2 questions: 1. did you honestly understand it? (watch it again!) 2. did you wanna hate it, but found you loved it, but dont wanna admit it? (watch it again!)to those of you who have seen it and love it......................................................................... ....................SEE IT AGAIN!!!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It had a great plot, excellent special effects and amazing fight sequences. It's sequel, on the other hand, has to be one of the worst films ever made. Lets start with the plot. It's like the Wachowski brothers put it in as an after thought to the action sequences. It makes little sense at the best of times and actually takes away from the story which was set out in the first film. The dialogue is contrived and you get the feeling that so many pointlessly large words were put in to confuse people into thinking something profound was being said. The action sequences have there moments, but soon the actors are replaced with computer generated characters that look all too cartoon-like. And I felt a little numbed towards the fight scenes after the first few, and just wanted them to end sooner. I was looking forward to seeing Laurence Fishburne as Morpheus in more actions sequences that the first film, but found it tedious watching a middle-aged fat man trying to look cool.I felt cheated that I actually paid to see this film and feel even worse that I'd seen the film at all. Do yourselves a favour, and pretend there were no sequels. The Matrix was excellent the way it was.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

If that is what you want to see....  put your DVD on shuffle and watch ""The Matrix.""What you will get is a much more cerebral journey into the Matrix.  Yes there are some parts that tend to drag a little, but each scene accomplishes somethingeither integral to this episode or perhaps the next. I enjoyed this movie and will be in line for the last installment.  I loved the action. With the exception of gun play, I feel as though the action equal to,  but didn't surpass, that from the first installment.  The romance is kept subdued, and best of all, the directors threw the characters (who seemingly had things neatlywrapped up at the end of the first one) for a loop.  Again, as the 3rd and last film approaches, we feel like there maybe no hope for mankind.I agree that this film lacked a few of the things that a lot of people arecomplaining about, but expectations aside I think that ""Reloaded"" will sit nicely between 2 visionary Sci/Fi films...

REad several comments.  I just wanted to note a few things and see what people think.I am sure we can all go on and on, but some points i want to make.First i am sure the main character's names all mean something.Some i can figure, some i cantNeo = One Morpheus is god of dreams, and talks about them often. plus his ship is Nebuchadanezzar, who had Daniel interpret his dreams in the Bible.Persephone: greek goddess of underworld, also represents spring Merovingian: some sect in Gaul (france), have no idea on that Bane: the word bane, as in ""bane of my existance"" others may be obvious like LInk, keymaker even Agent smith. as in a common name, hence a lot of them. I cannot figure what Trinity stands for.  ? holy trinty or something else.I also want to note: When Neo enters the Matrix on his own to see the oracle, the first images we see are a bunch of Jesus Christ items, pictures, candles, etc. and a few buddest ones when the scence goes to the street as he walks (Also note the Heinken Sign)So, what does that mean. Is Neo the savior?
Also, when he meets the Oracle, she offers him candy that when unwrapped looks like the red pill. He takes it and holds, but never eats it.  What does that mean. He wanted it right.Now Neo's converstaion with the Architect.  Neo suggests that the Oracle is the mother of the Matrix and the Architect responds with a scarcastic ""please"". as if she were not.I also notice that right before Neo disables the Sentinels in the real world, Trinity has the apperace of being on a TV through the wreakage down there.  I'm not sure it means anything, but it seems like they look different to me. who knows.And if you have seen the trailer for Revolutions, it makes it seem that Agent Smith is the ultimate villian and  not the machines, since he ""is no longer an agent of the system"" and Neo must defeat him for all to survive.anyhow, CommentsThe Oracle seems sincere to me for 2 reasons.  She said she thinks the only way to go in to the future is ""together"" suggesting the past hasn't worked. And she doesn't try to hard to convince him she is on his side.  Which seems consistent to me to someone who is sincere.Obviously there is truth in what the ARchitect says, but i dont think you can believe everything he says.  Obviously there are several Matrixes. the Merovingian points out that Neo had predecessors which doesnt make sense until you find out that Neo is the 6th one.  Teh Agents call him anomaly. and Smith says it's happening like before. Execpt for him of course But why will they system crash if Neo takes the wrong door.  I understand that he has powers because he is the anamoly, but why now will the system crach. too coincidental for me.  Like bulls***.  Obviously the machines dont know everything, cause why try and stop Neo if he's gonna go to the source anyhow and they know they cant beat himI dont we will know or can answer the quesitons until the next movie. But i am interested in others ideas.Overall, i enjoyed the movie.  I dont think you can fully judge it until you know how it ends. But it was great.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It picked up right where the first film left off and continued, so if you haven't seen the first one, I would recommend viewing it first so you have some idea what is going on.  I was skeptical about the movie being able to have content like the first one had.  Now that everyone knows what the Matrix is, I was curious if there was anywhere really new to go with it.  I was afraid there would be a weak plot, and it would be reduced to just a bunch of action and special effects.  The movie definitely did not let me down, though.  The plot remained engaging and interesting.  The pre-existing characters were developed much further, and the new characters were excellent.  The action scenes leave every other movie I've ever seen in the dust.  They are absolutely superb and mind-boggling.  I kept leaning over to my girlfriend going, ""How in the world can someone even think up something like this, much less get it on film?""  I left the theater with a headache trying to take it all in.  The only caveat I would give to the younger viewers is that the love scene is a bit gratuitous and seems to go on much longer than was really necessary.  An excellent movie...if you loved the first one, you definitely need to see it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first time that I saw the Matrix I was lost.  I left the theatre saying that I would not see it again because it was too confusing.  I usually enjoy films that entertain me for two hours but that I don't have to analyze or think about for too long.  But I could not stop thinking about the Matrix for days after I saw it.  Finally, a week later I had to go see it again.  The second time I saw it I was amazed.  I am not a big fan of science fiction yet I loved this movie.  I discussed it with friends and we debated over the meaning of so many parts of the film.  When the DVD came out I bought it and have watched it many times.  Before I went to see The Matrix Reloaded, I watched it again. I went to see The Matrix Reloaded last friday and I am still trying to decide how I feel about it.  Many people say that they liked the special effects better in this movie but did not like the dialogue or slow parts.  I feel just the opposite.  I thought that the special effects were overpowering but I loved the part of the film that was in Zion.  I liked the philosophy in this film and some of the new characters.  All I know is that I have to see this film again.  In some ways I feel the same as after I saw the Matrix.  Once again, just like when I saw the Matrix, this film has been on my mind since I saw it.  Once again I have discussed the film with friends.  What more can you ask of a movie than that.  I just saw Bruce Almighty with my friends and really enjoyed it.  But we did not talk about the film afterward and I know that tomorrow that film will not be on my mind.  When you think of it, there are not many movies that make you think like the Matrix and The Matrix Reloaded.  I know that I will be at the theatre on November 5th to see how this whole thing turns out.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I guess everything was covered in the first film, it covered every concept, bit of philosophy, plot ideas etc and had a perfect resolve, so then naturally the next ones feel wrong, dull, uninspired and awkward as well.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Instead it turned out to be a diluted version of the trailers I had previously downloaded from the internet a month before the theatrical release.The first thirty minutes of the movie are quite boring and contrived, and are designed to add some semblance of plot to the film. There is some use of computer animation early on and it fails miserably, easily souring your expectations for the movie early on (fortunately this is redeemed later on however, if you have not yet chosen to leave the theatre). For example, they attempt to show you what Zion (the last sanctuary for the human species) would look like, but instead it comes of looking cheap and cartoon-like. The large turning cog wheels that controlled the main door to Zion were reminiscent of the CG work in 'The Lord of the Rings' which is definitely not a positive aspect considering this is meant to be futuristic rather than medieval.Uneven is the best word to describe the film. I would classify the various scenes into two categories. One third of the entire movie features no action, and instead contains long expositions about uninteresting, nonsensical topics. Unfortunately many childish attributes litter these scenes, such as the 'key maker' who is integral to the quest, but is actually a small Chinese man who quite literally looks like a 'Home Depot' employee who would duplicate keys for you. This third of the movie is quite a turnoff and could possibly cause an impatient person to leave the theatre during the film.However, the actions scenes, which seemingly make up the other two-thirds of the film (although in retrospect it is likely that these scenes are just more memorable and seem to last longer) are usually very good, with two that I would consider brilliant, seeing as they improved upon the first film. These scenes feature a motorcycle chase, in reverse traffic no less, and a fight vs. nearly a hundred cloned 'Smith' agents in the park. If you enjoy motorcycling or car-chases, the thrills achieved here would probably be worth the price of admission alone. However, I must note that I was watching the film on an IMAX size screen, so this may have helped in making the experience more immersive and engrossing. Overall the action-oriented portion of the film successfully offset the boring parts as discussed in the previous paragraph.I would recommend seeing this film only if you can accept its numerous faults such as the embarrassingly contrived plot and dialogue, and also give it a fair chance to redeem itself. If you do enjoy actions scenes and computer graphics, then I suggest you see this film at a matinee and preferably on a big screen.7.5/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The 360 Slow Spinning effects are amazing - that's for sure. The first movie also had effects - for it's time they were more than amazing. But the unique element in it was that the movie was directed to a very wide audience - the 7-year old boys could yell 'Cool!' while other people could think about really serious and existentional... 'stuff' (I use that word, because I don't want to talk about that right now, it's not the point). So, the main idea in Reloaded stays the same. They've tried to improve it, but what came out after that is something... I'd say vague. I also love the effects - even adore them - watch them over and over again, but they're not what makes one movie great - great as 1999's The Matrix. The effects are the assets every modern movie should have. But when a movie starts relying on them, it degrades. The good news is that Reloaded is not one of these movies. The bad news is that it is close. I really hope that Revolutions won't be even closer. 'To be concluded' sounds really spooky :-) I'm really sorry that the greatest movie on this world will have only 3 series. As a conclusion - watch The Matrix Reloaded - you'll love it. Despite being not as great as the first part, it's still one of the greatest movies of all time and offers enough food for thought... It is The Matrix - it is unique, it is worshipful, 'It is inevitable' :-)Have fun!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The massively-anticipated first sequel to 1999's block-busting, genre-reinventing, boundary-pushing The Matrix is finally upon us after four years, accompanied by as much hype as you can shake a pair of shades at (Note: if you're not familiar with the original there's about as much point in reading on as there is in seeing this film, i.e. none).The first thing you notice about Reloaded is how being a $200m pre-sold major summer blockbuster buys you so much more than being a $70m sleeper hit (if there is such a thing); compared to this, the original seems so low budget and - and this is a strange comment considering we're talking about a film that dealt with the future of mankind - so small-scale. One man's journey to discover his destiny has become a battle to save humanity, and Neo is not our everyman in this strange and overwhelming world, but our superman.The virtually unlimited budget for Reloaded has given writing/directing siblings the Wachowski Brothers the means to show us everything they couldn't afford to last time. The creative freedom seemingly afforded to the Wachowskis has given them cart blanche to try our patience with an opening 40-odd minutes - based in the `real world' of Zion - that is so slow, so talky, so determined to show us every nook and cranny of their fictional universe, that the entire film threatens to keel over and die. As everybody knows, Reloaded is but the first half of a single, extra-long sequel (the second part, Matrix Revolutions, was shot simultaneously and is out in November). One could argue that, viewed in this bigger picture, this scene-setting is necessary and percentage-wise takes no longer than the setup of any other film but sorry guys, it's just done badly. After all, the two full hours of setup in the first part of the 10 hour-plus Lord of the Rings saga managed to inform and entertain, a failed balancing act that is sadly the Wachowskis only bum note in the saga thus far.Thankfully, when the plot finally chugs into gear and we return to the Matrix, all is swiftly forgiven. The trademark reality-defying kung-fu is simply breathtaking, the special effects blending almost seamlessly with flesh-and-blood actors to create action sequences that take the Bullet Time motif and up it to a new level of audience-adrenalising mayhem. It's the classic sequel adage of `the same, only bigger, better, more'. Whether laying waste to a stately mansion, wreaking havoc on a busy freeway, or The One taking on 100 Agents singlehanded, the money is all up there on the screen with some world-class, kick-ass action. Despite all the pixel manipulation, though, the biggest thrill comes from the fact that Keanu and co. are - with the help of wirework and months of intensive training - blatantly doing all that fighting for real. It's an irony that would bake the noodle of the Oracle herself.Ah yes, noodle baking; the very thing that made the original so stand out from the crowd. Kung fu and SFX aside, Reloaded spits out a last reel revelation so head*bleep*ing that it requires - nay, demands - a second viewing, and will send you staggering out into reality debating the implications till long into the night. But then what is reality anyway? What is the point of implications? I feel dizzy. Despite its faults (and did I mention the new characters that I hope to God get more to do in Revolutions?), that's so rare these days that to allow yourself to be unfairly influenced by the poor first third would be a crime.For me the most thrilling part of sequels - good sequels of course - is, having spent 3 or 4 years with one's imagination permutating seemingly infinite possibilities about where they could take the story next, when the real thing comes along it turns out to be nothing like you expected. As it has been pointed out, I was probably going to love Reloaded even if it turned out to just be Keanu Reeves reading the script in front of a camcorder for two hours. Luckily I don't need to fake my enthusiasm. Reloaded may be less visually stylised than the original, and may lack its smooth-flowing narrative, but the fact that I haven't even touched upon the sly visual humour, in-referencing of other movies, and the fact that for all its whizz-bang factor, it's a movie above all else about love, goes some way to proving that it succeeds far more than it fails. Managing to convert you from a state of massive disappointment after 45 mins to a state of mental contortions, with pupils dilated in pleasure, after 130 mins is no mean feat and ensures that, with part 3 promising a direct continuation, who knows where we'll end up come November. I for one can't wait to find out.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Matrix Reloaded is a really REALLY good movie. The actions scenes, which take up most of the movie, are absolutely mindblowing. While the animation is at points blatant, it's so incredibly well done, that you don't really care.
Surprisingly enough, the plot is actually quite interesting and thought provoking... well, for an action movie at least. The many spiritual allusions and metaphors are quite apparent, as well. The most interesting, or at least the coolest, is Neo's coat, obviously modeled after that of clergy.To sum it up in a word Reloaded is, ""Whoa"". You often hardly believe what's going on. See. This.

I actually got dressed up in a trenchcoat I found at the Salvation Army for $7.  I had bought my ticket about a month ago, and tonight was the night it came together.  Of course it only makes sense if you've seen the first one because this takes place at least 6 months after the first one and develops the issue of war.  The first hour is filled with sex, the second hour is violence, and the last 15 minutes exists just to make you need to see the third movie.  There's a trailer at the end for the third movie and I practically wet myself.  The special effects were amazing in this one.  I thought I might get tired of that ""bullet time"" trick, but they didn't really overdo it.  Also, the hand-to-hand fight sequences have improved. At one point, the graphics were so good that I couldn't tell where they switched from actors to CG models.  You could tell that it wasn't Keanu fighting with Hugo for a while, but then it really was them and you couldn't tell where the switchover happened.  Overall, it was put together nicely and left a huge loose end so you have to see the third one.  I'm going to see this one again next week after watching the first one again and The AniMatrix.  That should get everything together and make everything make sense again.  Now, I'll go plug back in and get these silly thought of civilization out of my head...(In this movie, we find out that Morpheus is really Neo's father and Trinity is Neo's sister... Oh wait, that's Star Wars, nevermind.)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Although nobody doubted their ability to create the most amazing action scenes, with guns, kung-fu or cars, the "" serious "" part of the movie ( explanations, dilemmas, or even love scenes ) are quite smoothly done -in my opinion better than in The Matrix .This means the Wachowski bros. have just created the new definite reference trilogy; a modern mix of all the ingredients the audience ( 10-30 years old as a target ) loves: sci-fi ( and they're very good at it ) kung-fu , car chases , swordfight , all of which done with unprecedented talent and efficiency, but also drama. One of my fears before seeing the movie was that it would be too much turned towards the "" Prophet Neo "" side, in a ridiculous sort of way. Well, this aspect is of course important, but it is not overdone, and Neo, even though he looks like some kind of Year Zero fighting priest, is a very good chararacter. Morpheus still takes himself a bit seriously, but that's part of the deal. After all, Star Wars took itself seriously too.In the end, I decided that the ""classic"" parts of the scenario, which is basically what happens in Zion ( the young and eager rookie, the old and wise counselor ) weren't too important, that the ""deja-vu"" from other movies ( the movie is much closer to Ghost in the Shell then the first one, and there is a Total Recall kind of twist ) were very well adapted and again, part of the deal : mixing genre movies with a great talent.As for what remains the main attract of the movie : the action, it is of course amazing, unseen before, and you get lots of it ( some scenes last over 20-25 minutes ) with extraordinary visuals and eye-candy.

"5","/10","Reloaded and rehearsed; my request: bring on the Revolution","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0703714/?ref_=tt_urv","stamper","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0426613/?ref_=tt_urv","19 May 2003","This film has been in the spotlight for quite some time now and so has it's follow-up The Matrix Revolution (which is due out in November sometime). The reason for that is quite simple, namely that these films are the follow-ups to one of the most refreshing, visually innovative and exciting films of the last 5 years: THE MATRIX. Now a lot has happened since The Matrix was released in 1999 and I can assure you that you won't awe like you've awed when you saw The Matrix for the first time, but I'll assure you, you'll be impressed.
Now there is not much of a story here, in that I agree with some other people that have posted comments before me, but instead of some people that did I say: there was enough. While watching the film, I felt that everything that was explained to me concerning the story was pretty much logical, given the events in the original movie. That means that you need to have seen the original to comprehend this film even remotely. This is not some Bad Boys II or Lara Croft II: The Cradle Of Life like film you can just tune into without knowing the full history. It is complicated and at times it is barely comprehensible for those of us who have watched The Matrix. With this I'm referring to some conversation near the end of the film, which were so filled with information that I'll be in need to watch it a couple of times more and rest assured, it won't be something I mind.
Regarding the film itself, I found that there is very little to say without spoiling the experience but I'll try and give as my positive as well as my negative criticism in a constructive way, so I do not offend anybody in the slightest way. First of all, I have to congratulate the Wachowski brothers (Andy and Larry for you that do not know) on making this film as visually stunning as the first, without repeating themselves and with adding still new tricks that blew me away and not only that, almost throughout the film the effects were amazingly incredible. There is however one small negative critique I have to give here, for in the fighting sequence on the truck between Morpheus and one of the Agents I was a bit disappointed by the effects. Now I am not sure whether they were out of money of whether this kind of technique isn't available yet, but I felt that for a short moment that sequence wasn't as sophisticated and shiny as the rest of the film. Apart from that I was very satisfied with the action, which (this is no critique) could have included a bit more shooting in my opinion. But enough on the negative comments, what about those white rasta (or was is dreadlock) twins? THEY WERE AWESOME!!! Mentioning them I have to say something about the new add-ons in to The Matrix Reloaded. There is (of course) Jada Pinkett Smith also Monica Bellucci, which are both extremely beautiful actresses, but apart from that I must say that they along with all other new additions (whom I will not mention by name) did a wonderful job in this film. The reason why I am only naming these two actresses is because I can feel in my gut that one of them (Pinkett) will have a crucial role in The Matrix Revisited and I'm mentioning Bellucci, because I thought her appearance was rather odd. I am not referring her appearance in general, but rather to the bathroom scene with Keanu Reeves she appeared in. That scene struck me as rather odd while I was watching it, although it did not disturb me. The thing is probably, that I am wondering if there is anything more behind it than they showed. Speaking of scenes in the film I do not understand brings me to the party / togetherness scene which I thought was overly (though not yet awkwardly) long. I admit that at the end I was able to grab the essence that persuaded the Wachowski brothers to insert it into the film, but I was nonetheless able to understand why they made that scene so long.
Because I do not want to bore you with detailed description of all the cool action sequences and because I do not want to spoil you're viewing experience I think it is time for me to tell you what you should expect of this film (I have to underscore again that you probably won't like this film much or even understand it if you haven't seen The Matrix). The thing with the Matrix Reloaded is, that it builds forth on the story from The Matrix and that it therefore can neither be required to have much of a story (look at other trilogy's and figure out what their midsection's story is) nor that it needs one. The thing is there is probably a red line that connects all three films (at least there is a line that connects The Matrix and Reloaded) and that it therefore cannot be divided into parts that have a story. Rather these films have to be viewed as a whole. What can you expect of Reloaded then? Well, a lot of cool action in sometimes very impressive and cool sequences, heart, emotion and foremost you can expect a good time. Is it better than the first you ask and I reply NO. Is it a good sequel you ask and I say YES.
Be sure that I'll revisit for the REVOLUTION, nay be certain

The reason: Depending on how they resolve this cliffhanger I could either love or hate this movie.  The way they left it though, it looks like a bit of cop out, but I'll tell you no more.  Instead, I will review on its own merits, ignoring the cliffhanger.This movie had better action scenes, and better special effects, but other than that, the first one was better.  Don't get me wrong, this is still a great action movie, but as an SF movie it is rather average.  But then again, once the premise is laid out with such perfection, how can this one be better than the first?  In other words, the whole premise is told, and the conclusion will be told in the next movie, this one is all middle.  So what we have in this one is great action scenes.  There is a lot of philosophical talk in this one too, some of it is thought provoking, but it is not on the level of excellent Science Fiction.  We also get to see the city of Zion, an impressive piece of work I might add.  We learn more about human society, and about some of the rogue programs that never got deleted. We also get quite possibly the best car chase in cinematic history.  This movie is like a great a ride that seems to keep going a little too far past its welcome.  Everything's good until the last 15 minutes.  The cliffhanger ruined it a bit for me.  7/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie could not have been produced had The Matrix that preceded it not been such a success.  As a result, The Matrix Reloaded is sure to anger and disappoint almost anyone who is looking for a coherent story line.  The Wachowski brothers were smart to pull off a package deal to get both the second and third films made, because there may have been some additional studio pressure about content and accessibility for the third if it was still in progress.  This film does, however, offer special effects that in many ways extend the effects of the first, but also have a very characteristic feel to them that makes them uniquely their own.  In particular, the fight scenes definitely aren't quite real, but not quite fake -- which is to be expected since that is the nature of the world in which the story occurs.  The influences pulled from the anime film genre are also very apparent in this installment, and more so than in the first film: there is definitely an emphasis on the art and philosophy of the movie over the story of the movie. The story is indeed there, and it is indeed understandable, but one has to look at the entire picture as a whole, while bearing in mind that the conclusion is still yet to come. Overall, it can be a satisfying film, but one must have a very open mind in order to appreciate its peculiarities.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was by far the best movie that I have seen all year.  The movie opens with a dream of Neo, in which it looks like Trinity dies.  This is a recurring them throughout the movie, so when the viewer actually sees it unfold later in the movie, they have no idea what to expect.  I have read many critics reviews, and most of them complain about the fact that this movie does not have a good plot.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It expounds upon the plot from the first movie, adds a whole lot of new elements, and at the end throws a humongous twist in there.  The movie centers around Neo.  He is trying to find out his purpose in life.  He knows that he is The One, but he does not know the path he should follow.  The journey that he and his crew take is exhilarating to say the least.  I will not delve into it any further b/c I do not wish to ruin the plot for you.  The martial arts is probably the main reason people are going to watch the movie, and it does not disappoint.  From Neo's first fight with the agents to his last fight with Agent Smith(s), the fights are intense.  The ""Burly Brawl"", where Neo fights 100 Agent Smiths, is one of the best and most humorous fight scenes that I have ever seen.  The freeway chase scene sets the new limit, which all car chases must now reach.  I normally don't yell during a movie, but there were two moments in there where I felt like a 5 year old again.  The movie is definitely worth watching, solely for that sequence.  I'm sure most of you have made up your mind already, but you MUST go watch this movie.  And whatever you do, DON'T leave until the end credits finish rolling.  You'll be in for an excellent surprise.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Wachowskis, instead of taking the opportunity in crafting a movie that lives up to the expectations of the original, cash-in on their own popularity by making a movie that's 99% fluff.What little there is to ""think"" about is merely a vague notion that the Wachowski intentionally leave blank, because they themselves did not know what they wanted to do with it.Reloaded introduces characters that no one really cares about, and do nothing with them, except have them fight or be a reason to fight about. Smith, perhaps, is the singular exception to this.  He can't save the movie, but is one of the few things that make this movie bearable.The symbology throughout the movie is obviously that of Judeo-Christian religion.  Congratulations, you've just joined the hundreds of other movies that also use this symbology.  Essentially, all the Wachowskis did was open up a mythology book and name characters after the people they found in there.  It's not really subtle or unique.Action?  You will find no artistry in the action in the Matrix Reloaded.  In terms of cinematic ""fat,"" this is one of those movies that's excessively obese. The fight scenes here are made to... distract people from seeing that there is little in the way of an actual plot in this segment of this ""2-part movie"".  You can literally cut all but one of the actual fight sequences out (the Smith fight), since they have NOTHING to do with the story, and you'd have a boring hour of people talking about philosophy. Speaking of which, the fight scenes are extremely ugly.  The first THREE fight scenes are the Wachowskis trying to do John Woo and Jackie Chan, only very poorly.  It actually HURT my eyes watching Neo and the Agents go at it. UGLY with a capital ""UG"", even for Wire-Fu.Smart marketing.  As many people have said, one can only understand the Matrix Reloaded's meanings by watching the ""Animatrix,"" the original ""Matrix"", and the video game, ""Enter the Matrix,"" and THEN go out to watch ""Matrix Revolutions.""  Buy/see them all, you MIGHT buy yourself a clue as to what the Matrix sequels really are... a cash-cow for the Wachowskis.Final ThoughtsActing: Wooden and contrived.  Not a single memorable character except Smith, and even he is not immune to being a bit... shallow.Special Effects: Dominates the movie, the reason anyone sees it.Plot: Incomplete.  The last thirty minutes of the film reveal anything really meaningful to the story thus far.Overall rating: 3 of 10 (I'll give the other points to Revolutions, the OTHER half of this ""movie"").","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Most people who did not like the movie are either extremely dumb to not understand the complexity of such a great script or are extremely naive to only wish that if this thing should have been done it would be better. Like in the first matrix people will say we loved it, and then say we hate part 2, ask them what did they think of the First matrix when they saw it the first time , they will always say, it was confusing at first, looks like none of the dumb viewers have learnt from their mistakes, you should enjoy the movie for WHAT IT IS and keep an open mind, as for the people disliking the movie to be continued, im sure you didnt like Lord of the Rings part I, one of the best movies ever made, that says it all about your mentality","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What was I expecting? Action², a better understanding of Zion and the human resistance, and more elaboration on that Matrix and what it is. Did they deliver? They sure did!This movie has more impressive Kung Fu than any movie I've seen prior to this. The only way they could've impressed me more is if they reincarnated Bruce Lee to replace the Oracle's bodyguard program.Now we know what Zion's all about. Great job on feeding all our hungry minds knowledge that we were so lacking after the origional Matrix.Elaboration about the Matrix? ...now that I think about it did Morpheus really have a clue as to what the Matrix really was? Cause his explanation was kinda brief (in part 1)... yeah yeah... I know... he was just trying not to freak Neo out. :P I especially like the plot building in terms of the Matrix not being this perfect all conforming entity but essentially being composed of many parts all of which/whom are not part of the Machine's master plan.All in all like I said in my title... on a scale of 1.00-100.00 I give The Matrix: Reloaded a 99.7. They lost .3 because of that BAD BAD BAD BAD (insert more slanderous words here) 5 minute scene in Zion starting during Morpheus's speech, continuing through the Zion ""RiverDance"", again continuing back in Neo's room as he gets nasty with Trinity, and ending with an ass shot of Neo... what?

I have avoided most all the ""hype"" and advertising of it because I knew this film would be good and didn't want to have anything potentially spoil any element of the story for me, like reading a sound track title which gives away a major plot point, or something equally as lame which was the case with ""The Phantom Menace"" and the track, 'The Death of Qui-Gon' for many folks. 	Once again I was treated to a incredible experience full of fun, thought and an excitement level I have felt only a dozen, or so times in the theater in my 30+ years of movie going.  This film was not only action packed, but intellectually packed just like its predecessor.  It is wonderfully designed again with superb pacing, innovative and attractive costumes, solid dialog, strong acting and of course 'kick ass' special effects and beautiful choreography!  My favorite thing about this film is what I loved about its predecessor and films such as ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"", which is the balance of a meaty story and exquisite action choreography that allow the actors nearly unprecedented opportunities to shine and create meaningful characters that are interesting to most anyone and loved by millions: something any good story does no matter the medium in which is told. 	Woo-ping Yuen should receive a special academy award for his years of beautiful and outstanding choreography in so many wonderful films!  Reeves used to bother me at worst (""Dracula"" 92) and was tolerable at his best (""Little Buddha"") and my wife couldn't stand him at all, yet we both loved him in both Matrix films (even when he says ""Whoa.  Free your mind, free your mind"" and sound a lot like 'Ted').  Fishburne is the epitome of cool and confidence and that ability is allowed to shine here even more than before.  It is only bonus that all he believes in falls into question once more in his life!  Again, the hallmark of a great story.	I could go on and on in so many directions, but I will not.  Suffice it to say that if you are a fan, or even have some interest in action movies that have not only heart, but actual soul you will enjoy this film.  You might even find yourself loving it.  The Wachowski brothers are a pair to watch out for since all the films they have made are far above average.  These two have done more to make films more visually interesting than any other directors save perhaps Ridley Scott and Akira Kurosawa.  The fact that they are also the writers of their stories makes them all that much more exciting. 	I have seen ""Reloaded"" twice now and will see it again in a few days. I am sure I will continue to find more to love.  Having a super enthusiastic audience, as my first viewing (5/14/03 at 10 PM) did, makes it all that much more enjoyable.  You know a film is good when most of the audience not only laughs at the same time, but OOOHs and Ahhhs as well and then stays through all the credits (something I do 95% of the time) as a scant few do! 		Yeee Ha can't wait till November!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Almost every scene in this movie drags on for too long and there is no reason for any of them to last as long as they do. The only good parts in the movie end up being the action scenes which are still mostly really good, although even the action scenes can last too long and become repetitive. The story in this movie is a huge step down and it's very uninteresting and doesn't really facilitate the action scenes very well, it seems they just add in random action scenes when they think the movie is getting boring.

There are however a few things about the film i would like to say, many people complain about the cheesy acting of Neo and morpheous and how they are so cliched, personally, i find the cool, emotionless look that they present, well f***ing cool, Neo is the one, why should he show any emotion, he can do whatever he wants and he knows it, also, in our modern day, comparing these actors with 80's Shwarzenegger and 90's Bruce Willis, these people fit in perfectly with today. Also, the way Neo fights, comparing him with other martial arts stars like Chan is just awseome.Finally, no, the film can't really live up to it's predacessor, but also, people were crying out for a sequel, something had to be done.

It stands on its own, and can appeal to most mainstream audiences. Most anyone can understand the plot. With Reloaded, however, people didn't really understand it. But they figured, ""Hey, there's a third one coming out, so it'll all become clear when I see that one."" So because of this thinking, most peoples' first impression of Reloaded wasn't negative. And first impressions usually stick. They just brushed off all of the convoluted plot and enjoyed it for what it is, expecting the third one to offer clearer explanations. And so because Revolutions didn't offer any clear answers, Reloaded is looked at as the better of the two sequels by most people. I think that's a pretty unfair observation myself. Both films are equally convoluted in my opinion. But the third in a trilogy is usually meant to give closure, and for many it did not succeed. Reloaded did not have that obligation, thus it's looked at in a better light than Revolutions is.But I find that the answers ARE in Revolutions, however vague they are. If one understands what Revolutions was really all about, then people should at least see both sequels in an equal light. They'll not only like Revolutions, but they'll also enjoy Reloaded even more than before - now that they actually get what's going on.My personal opinion is that Reloaded is the weakest of the trilogy. I think it's good, but because of that 5 minute party/orgy/sex scene that totally stopped the movie in its tracks, and too much dialogue at times, I rate it lower than the rest. And I liked the action in Revolutions much better (although the highway chase and the Neo/Smith burly brawl in Reloaded are definitely cool). ""The Matrix"" is a 10, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is an 8, and ""The Matrix Revolutions"" is a 9.For further info on the plot of the trilogy, check out www.thematrix101.com . I found it to be really good at helping me understand the films more, since I was also someone who found them too convoluted at first. Once the plots became clear, I came to really love these films. I hope that you'll do the same, because there's a lot more there besides kung fu fights and war scenes. I think you'll find that the Wachowski brothers didn't sacrifice substance for style after all.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The films main purpose was to amaze who have been desensitized over to years to special effect and sex. Geared away from the intelligence of the original, this overly fast paced Wachowski orgasm lends itself if to the `Fast and Furious' and `American Pie' type mentality. Showing zero respect to females, Reloaded treats women like meat (with lines like `Where's my pu...') and exploits them as sexual objects with the tasteless Cake Scene. However, the bad tastes all begins in a music-video type orgy scene intercut with a pointless love seen gear towards horny men who dragged their girlfriends to the movie so they too can get off on Andy and Larry's fantasies. Not only were the special effects bad, but there were way too many of them. The faces of Neo and Trinity in the `improved-bullet-time-not-really scenes' do not look anything like Reeves or Moss. Now, if the scenes were less that three minutes (a time which no action scene in the original went over) people might not have been able to identify the poor work of the special effects crew. But since the entire movie was filled with action scenes easily passing 10 minutes, your find time to see that Morpheous does not look like him, and Neo's coat has absolutely no texture or rendering to it. Was it me, or did Neo go from having a fairly tame mouth in the first one to a mouth like Joe Pesci in Goodfellas? Between the orgies and the violence, we tried to get a grasp of a possible story line,  but it was coded in a sea of wordiness by a guy who I think was an architect (Not sure...CAUSE NO ONE EXPLAINED IT!) and the over zealous speeches by Lawrence Fishboune. I foresee this movie taking the same path of Star Wars: Episode One. It was the greatest film ever when it came out, but when we look back now, we can clearly see, it is a film based on the pure one dimensional plot that it has disguised by too many special effects, and bad acting.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Of course there were few quite lame clichés but after all it has more clever plot than 90% of the movies in same genre.

Sure, the action scenes and visual effects are more complicated and more breathtaking than in the original movie, but these were only a part of the original's success. (Gaeta's work in visual cinematography and bullet-time worth many oscars, that's for sure.) I got the feeling that most actions scenes were there because the audience expected them to be, and not because the plot ""demanded"" them in order to evolve - a tottaly different approach from the original ""Matrix"", where every action scene had its purpose. The thought of Wachowski Bros saying ""the story in this chapter goes too slow, let's put an action scene here and here"" crossed my mind several times. So is the story the problem? No. There were many interesting answers and even more interesting (new) questions. The plot by itself evolves nicely. In my opinion, the problem lies in the fact that ""Matrix Reloaded"" action scenes and plot don't mix as they should. I give it 8 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Needless, was it worth it, well after the disappointments of Starwars I and II, I fail to be ignorant to hype anymore but I was ooo-ed and ahhh-ed through out the movie especially during the fight scenes.  I do agree with some of the points of earlier posts of the weak plot fills and terrible ending but I wouldnt go as far as TERRIBLE and WASTE of money.  I guarantee  those people were clenching there fist and had gaping mouths open like I did through the fight sequences.  There will always be people like that and always want to be those who ""think"" they are beyond the masses by trashing anything good in anything.  (must give them purpose in this world)  Though Im not a fan of it, I did enjoy the audiences loyal applauses through out the movie which gave the idea we all generally wanted to see the characters succeed here but....THE DANCE SEQUENCE...not needed.  Seriously after the first literal 5 minutes I started to look around the theater and then try to find possible hidden meanings with the human primativeness that was needed to be addressed between man and machine. I was wondering if I was watching Dirty Dancing or Basic Instict...or even Shaka-Zoo-Loo.  I DID enjoy the furthering of this story.  There was more to this rather than ""oh, we did well with matrix 1 so lets make a more fighting sequel"".  To my delightment, I was happy with whatever point the brothers were trying to make with psyco-chaotic-inter-dimensional meaning .....maybe someday I may figure it out but in the meantime I'll enjoy watching this again.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Not all critics may agree with me, but it has been a difficult assignment to make a worthy sequel on such an original movie like The Matrix. The movie has cost a fortune, and it shows: the best special effects ever. The movie is very entertaining, and really leaves the spectator thinking. A star performance by Laurence Fishburne, who is without question the best actor in this movie, because he maintains the cool attitude he had in part one. The only bit disappointing thing in the film is the role of Neo. This is such a rigid character, it doesn't leave Reeves any space to give his personal twist. But still, an outstanding movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Who didn't leave the theater and look at the world and lives anew and ask themselves, ""Am I in The Matrix?""  Did you really think ""The Matrix Reloaded"" was going to provide a similar revelation? If you were, take a step back and appreciate ""The Matrix Reloaded"" for what it is:  The best action film of 2003, maybe the best action film since the first ""Matrix.""

Sweet! *Gulp* WHOA!As most of you know, The Matrix Reloaded is half a story - if you did not know this, where have you been the last 4 years ?!?! I was expecting the cliffhanger at the end and it was better than I thought it would be. They could've made me pull my hair out if they stopped it a bit earlier, but I'm glad they didn't.The movie was great. I am a Matrix fan and I love the way the directors toy around with philosophy. They want to make you think and that they do. See if you can follow the conversation after neo enters the room with a lot of t.v. screens. You'll know what I mean.More time was spent on the characters in the first than in this sequel. The action is far better than the first and I must say the eye candy is endless! Reloaded builds on a lot of material from the first movie and raises new questions. Reloaded does a good job in expanding the story, but one who hasn't seen the first movie will be so confused he/she might wake up in the real world ;)Emotion.. yea yea.. but come on. This is the Matrix! What were you expecting? Braveheart? English Patient? I think the movie was very well done. I will see this atleast 3-4 more times in theatres. The action is breathtaking and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Has to be some of the coolest action ever in a movie. The VFX is out of this world.In the end, the Matrix pulls off a successful sequel. It's far better than the first and will satisfy all you hungry fans out there.

I was in fact blown away by the fact of its linkage to our real-world now, in 2020.
This one had so many magical/mystical scenes, which felt like awesome scenes in those kiddy days but now seems more like meh thing although not so much & was really taken away by the creativity of those creators. This instalment had more arousing scenes and seems like a good fit to cover the adult audiences & there were some crazy action sequences to cover up the kiddy audiences.

It has cool special effects, great characters, and a couple of great plot twists.  So why do so many people don't like it? Expectations, plain and simple.  The story didn't go where they wanted it to go, so they throw a temper tantrum.  Sorry guys, next time just sit and enjoy the movie (and there is quite a bit to enjoy).  The scene where Neo takes on about 100 Agent Smiths is one of the best martial arts action sequences ever put on film.  The critics all complain about the characterization, yet I found the relationship between Neo and Trinity to be a pleasant surprise.  The biggest laugh I've had yet is when reviewers say it has no plot, or that a certain plot twist involving `The Architect' was mumbo jumbo.  It's obvious that they just didn't understand the plot twist or the whole philosophy of foreordination versus predestination, which is what this movie is actually about.  Are we making choices for ourselves or are we just fated to walk along the path to our ultimate destiny and free choice is an illusion?  This is the question posed by `The Matrix; Reloaded'.  Many others are upset that this question ultimately went unanswered in this film, however, withhold your final judgment until `The Matrix; Revolution', because where as one film poses the question, I'm hoping that the next will provide an answer, thus turning the Matrix into a thesis on Freedom of Choice.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I thought that it was the greatest movie ever, but before this I thought the Matrix was. Maybe to some of you you won't find it as great as I found it, but it really was, at least for the real fans of the original who understood what made it more than just good. Here's the thing- it is loaded with special effects, which is one of the reasons people enjoyed the first movie, but, behind that there is a great engrossing story and action movie that takes you deeper in than you would think possible. People say too many special effects; I disagree, and say that they are only a backdrop to aid in the movie. The people who have said things like that it had no plot or nothing new I have a few things to say A) They've probably seen so many movies it has jaded their perception when viewing a new and different movie, B) They must have been asleep because there is plenty new, and C) of course there is nothing BRAND NEW! It is a trilogy, not a series, so each movie builds on the last one. If it was something like (best example I can think of) Star Trek, they would have something new because they are not building to a final climax. They are in trilogies, like Star Wars or any other. I would say that the ending of this movie does definitely make you want to see the next one and that this movie takes everything that made the last one truly great and builds on it. The ideas of the Matrix are built up and the fight scenes are incredible. Maybe it is the people who enjoyed the Matrix but didn't love it, because they liked it for different reasons, but as for me I would say it is like the Star Wars of today.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie is certainly amusing and exciting, but it lacks the freshness of the first installment and certainly lacks a coherent story line. Part of the charm of the first Matrix was the small group of people involved, now there are many more characters and the significance of many is lost in the little screen time they get.Watch it as you would eat a big mac, filling at first, but soon you'll be hungry again.8/10 (primarily because of the special effects)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It keeps your eyes on the screen for a mind blowing 138 minutes;. 138 Minutes well spend I might add. The fight scenes are top notch, and I found myself smiling through all fights. Not only the fight scenes were great, but so is the storyline. It's a bit complex (I use the term lightly) and leaves you with lots of questions, which leaves all possibilities wide open for the follow up of this movie, the matrix revolution.I was also surprised to see that the hacking was great! No weird 3D interface this time no one ever saw before. No, Trinity hacks using NMAP and a SSH1 exploit! wow!Are there no downsides to this movie you might ask? Well yes, there are. As probably everyone knows that saw the trailers, there is a part where Morpheus, Neo and Trinity go to Zion, the underground city of the humans. And let's be honest, that's one boring part. I have no idea what the brothers were thinking. Other than that, great movie.Shorty's Rating: 9/10. Go see it, now!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie ends on a sort of anticlimax, which one would expect to be followed by an even greater buildup and true climax. But 6 months is a long time to wait.  While the action here is more spectacular then in the original, there actually seems to be less of it.  There is a good bit of information about how various programs ""live"" in the Matrix and its inner workerings, though they are nothing mind boggling like the original concept. Perhaps in combination with the Matrix Revolutions it will be a more satisfying experience.  But as it stands there are still plenty of awesome fight scenes, a few cool new characters, and of course dazzling special effects.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Some of its highlights include a massive 1-vs-100 man fight and a fantastic 20-minute highway chase (which is still my favorite car chase scene of them all). There are loads of other fights, pursuits, and encounters scattered throughout. There's some drag just in the first hour or so, and some parts become so outlandish or campy that they won't sit well with some viewers (chief among them being the underground rave, which never really bothered me, but it is a little frivolous).Despite these embellishments, the storytelling still doesn't really suffer much. If anything, it's become much more complicated, as the mythos is expanded, new characters and concepts are introduced, and more philosophy is explored. One integral scene toward the end is intended to place the entire saga in its proper context, but it is encumbered by one too many big words in too short a time. All of this makes the initial viewing rather confusing. It's even more stressed with a big cast of minor characters, whose importance are revealed more in the ""Animatrix"" and the ""Enter the Matrix"" video game. But if you stick with it, give it some thought, and pay close attention, it is rather sublime. Characters are as strong as they were in the first film, and there is a whole world of great new ideas that are brought up.The film is quite slick, with quality photography and editing. Acting is as strong as the first film, with the talents of Keanu Reeves (at his most monotone), Lawrence Fishburne, Carrie-Ann Moss, Hugo Weaving, Harold Perrineau, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Monica Bellucci thoroughly dispensed here. Writing is quite strong. Production value is high, featuring plenty of quality sets, props, costumes, and elaborate special effects. Music is pretty good.If you've enjoyed the ""Matrix"" at all, or if you are a die-hard fan, then this film is recommended. But for casual viewers, I can only recommend it as a rental, if you are at all interested.4.5/5 (entertainment: 4.5/5, story: 4/5, film: 4.5/5)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The awesome action, good dialogue, the subtle references to Socrates' ""Allegory of the Cave"", and a plot that keep you on the edge of your seat.  Unfortunately, the sequel, though great action, lacked the punch of the first movie.The second movie, though great action, seemed to lack a bit in the dialogue. Its not the movie was poorly written, on the contrary, it seems so perfectly written that you had to have read the previous rewrites of the script to make any sense of it (I kind of felt like I was reading ""Finnegan's Wake"" again).  After having seen the movie, I am still not sure what happened.  I remember the awesome fight scenes, but can't recall I word of dialogue.  Though, the movie did build well off the dialogue in the original, the movie flows more like a class in philosophy rather than a class in film making.That said, the only other problem with the movie involves Neo himself (this has nothing to do with Keanu's acting performance, mind you).  There is a point halfway through the film where you realize, ""Ok, he is the One and no one can even hurt him, move on.""  The only moving scene with Neo in it is his final choice (which I won't go into here).All in all it was a great flick, though the ending is nothing but a promo for the September Matrix movie.  I can't wait to see it again, not for the action, like I was looking forward to, but rather so that I can understand ""the words that were coming out of their mouths.""","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Much much more in terms of beautifully choreographed sensory overload, and more in the depth to the story of man vs. machine, but less in that the element of mystery is gone, the story is quite literal and the reality/unreality head-trippiness of the first film is no more. This is no longer a voyage of discovery for our protagonist, but a mission to save one's beloved and perhaps save a people.Forget the TIME review and all that you've heard or read, the film will exceed your expectations unless you are a total sensory overloaded 14-year-old computer-gaming geek. Action action action - get ready to hold on to your seat. The best special effects ever, and the green palette of the film used perfectly. Stunning fight and chase sequences, amazingly realized expressions of Neo's now massive power within the Matrix. Every performance is more assured, the logic of the story more propulsive and less ponderous (except for the strange Shakespearian cadence to Lawrence Fishburne's Morpheus - what is up with that speaking style? Who made this fine actor do that?). You will want to see this film at least one more time, to feel the rush of riding this thrilling roller coaster again. Probably not since the first Star Wars came out in '77 will people see the same film so many times.I'll reveal no story details, because, frankly, they don't matter much - the plot points were laid out in the first film, and this story is a natural continuation of the storyline, and it perfectly sets up the final installment of the trilogy Matrix:Revolution which comes out in November (but one does wonder where all those underground dwellers get their food and take showers). Reloaded is mostly fight sequences with mythology becoming a stronger strain to the story. I can almost predict the final line to the third film Revolution will be from Terry Gilliam's Brasil, ""'Ere I am, the ghost in the machine."" Ponder that theme for a second and you get the drift of where they're taking the story. But love and power is at the heart of Reloaded, with a mix of earnestness and deception thrown in for spice.It is all about the visceral in this film - movement movement movement, which starts with a dream and ends with us wondering what is real and what is real-real, with the ""real"" Neo doing something that defies the laws of physics - and sets our minds wondering, how deep does the illusion go? In the meantime we get a visual feast and stunts so spectacular and fight sequences so creative, it's no wonder actress Carrie-Anne Moss broke her leg. The film will stand the test of time as a work of art for its visuals, and the mish-mash of themes and character archetypes we've seen in countless other science fiction films and in novels that populate Reloaded have the chance to coalesce into something terrific for Revolution - if the brothers can pull it off. They have raised the bar very high indeed for Revolution with Reloaded. Will our characters live a hell a thousand times over or will renegade programs do more than survive and/or serve themselves?Don't bother looking for clues to what's in the story before the film opens, better to let it wash over you when you do finally strap in for the wild ride - you will not be disappointed. And I really didn't think the first one was all that great. Reloaded is better than Matrix. Much better.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

We were very disappointed as a group because it lacks the spirit of the first Matrix. However when you are channel surfing and happen to see it, Matrix 2 is one of those films that you just can't let go. My eyes tend to look at the screen in perplexity because these scenes are just eye candy. I have really enjoyed all the fights and the speed that this movie has. The special effects are superb; of course. They spent millions on them. I am a Sci-Fi kind of guy so watching the twins scenes was so cool. The script is worthless. Mi 5 year old niece would have made a better one. Morpheus gives so many soulless speeches he could have been shot and we all Matrix lovers would have been so glad. The highway chase is so enjoyable. Some time ago it was said that there were so many flaws in this movie (The goofs section now contains over 50) guess that's a suggestion that there were a lot of enthusiasts watching Matrix Reloaded enough times to catch these minor details. If you spend three months recording scenes chances are some mistakes will show up, but the soul of the movie is action.Matrix One had a pretty good story. Maybe the Watchowsky brothers spent quite some time developing and refining it. On Reloaded they must have been rushed to collect on the Matrix eruption and didn't quite made a solid sequel. It's better than the third though.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I love that this movie contains all diversity: from the grossest violence of our culture to the deepest truths of life, something for every level of understanding.And wait until the end for the preview of Revolutions.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's Burly Man (100 Agent Smith's) fight scene is probably the best to date, and the car chase's effects are gorgeous. Of course, the Wachowski brothers still will twist your mind all the way around, then flip it and twist it again to rattle your nerves. In 30 years, this will be thought of as a sci-fi classic.

1.) They were turned off by the CGI 2.) They didn't like the philosophy monologues.To which I respond...1.) I am so thankfull that I live in a time where technology allows a directors vision can be realized with reasonable quality and the only limitation being time and patience. Yeah, within about 10 years the agent smith fight might look hokey, but so what? It's still entertaining, and YES it does progress the plot, it wasn't just eye candy.2.) People keep listing T2, star wars, alien, as other good sci-fi films. And I agree, they are. But Reloaded as totally lifted the bar. Why? One reason, DEPTH. The whole point of these movies isn't to make the audience feel smart by telling them things they already know, but making them think. This movie, unlike many other sci-fi classics, has RELEVENCE to our lives. Look at all the symbolism in the architect scene, BRILLIANT! (No, not JUST the architect as god, listen to what he says, think about it, dig deeper) The philosophy all progresses the underlying theme of Reloaded and that is Free will. This movie didn't work for alot of people because it was not NEARLY as escapist as T2 or other action/sci-fi films.
I thought this movie was a brilliant work of art, I felt like I was watching ""Waking life"" and ""Terminator 2"" at the same time with a deep understanding of Love thrown into the mix. If you're watching it only for the action sequences or just ignoring the parts you don't understand you are only getting 1/4 of this movie.Think about it, there is no film that has ever been made that is anything like Reloaded, with the exception of the first film but even that's not too close. I think alot of the depth of this film is being lost on alot of people, it's not just ""ninth grade stoner talk"" it's relevant deep insights into the nature of our existence that the worlds most brilliant philosophers have been discussing for centuries. At the risk of sounding condescending, I really think that those who are detracting this film really just didn't ""get it"" as much as they could. Don't go into this movie with sarcasm, because that will ruin it for you. And that's true in your life too, sarcasm (or too much of it, rather) will keep you from really understanding love and the joys and understandings of other things that come from it.
1.) Let's say your plugged into a computerized dream world and you don't know it, how can you be free?2.) Alright, let's say you AREN'T in a computerized dream world, how can you be free then?I think this is an excellent film, but if you watch it the same way you watched T2, aliens, or star wars, or even the first matrix, much of the film will get lost on you and you will be dissapointed.I heard somebody say that seeing this film the first time and trying to take it ALL in (the action sequences, the philosophy, the hidden themes, ect.) was like ""trying to swallow an apple whole"".I like it alot,-Billy","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I warn you, do not plan on doing anything important or anything that requires concentration for at least 24 hours after watching this movie, because you won't be able to think about anything but THE MATRIX.
Also, make sure to schedule several open nights into your calendar because there is so much going on in this movie in terms of visuals as well as plot points that there is no way you can understand it all without seeing several times.And although it leaves you hanging at the end, it contains a complete enough story to qualify as an actual movie.

But I was disappointed. The start was pretty good, and the filming, especially of the Neo's fight with the multiple Smiths was great. But the parts I really felt odd was the Neo's fight with bad guys after getting the Keymaker. I mean there are so many weapons around, why keep kicking and hitting when he could have finished them off like when he walked into the building in Part One. Secondly, the voices, especially of Morpheus, it was emotionless and monotonous and became rather strange to me near the end at the power switch off briefing.Anyway all in all, I'd give it a 5/10 max.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Sure, it has quite a bit of action and not as much thought/story as the first one, but that is done intentionally and by necessity, not laziness on the part of the writers.  The 1st Matrix had to introduce the audience to a new and completely foreign world, and thus a lot of explanation was necessary.  The end of the 1st one set the stage for the beginning of ""the war"" and this Matrix is the war in action.  This makes perfect sense. Preparation for a war is very cerebral, but once the fighting begins, it becomes a lot less so.  But fear not, there is still quite a bit of new information that we learn (most, but not all of which, comes during the final 25 minutes) and I can honestly say that I was anticipating much less story and was happy to be proved wrong.  The ending, of course, is not an ending at all, and a number of events that occur at the end can not be fully judged now but will have to wait till the 3rd, when the truth (hopefully) will finally be revealed and we can trace events back in our mind.  I would currently rate this film a 9/10, but, like many of the critics have stated, that rating may well change pending the conclusion in November.  For now, though, this is an extremely fun sci-fi action film that, while not as smart as the original, is certainly smarter than most films and leaps and bounds above the typical summer blockbuster.  Come into it expecting to hate it and you will, but approach it looking to be drawn in and have a good time and you will most definitely not be disappointed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie made me ask myself, ""When they wrote the first Matrix, did they actually have the intention of two more?"" I say this because this is one of the worst movies I have seen in my life, and if anything thats an understatement. Keanu Reeves seems to have reverted to his Bill and Ted style of acting, and I don't see how he can ever headline a film again. Hello Mark Hamill the 2nd. The Matrix: Reloaded is really similar to the second Star Wars movie (attack of the clones?), in the fact that it is so political. If somebody wants to watch a movie about politics they will go watch something like Bullworth or Wag the Dog. I was expecting The Matrix, what I got was The West Wing, with worse acting.

The acting was fair,  but the acting isn't what makes these movies. It's helpful that they do a good job but it's the story, the action, and the special effects that really propel this vehicle.  And on those levels this movie was as mind-blowing as they come.  The highway scene was the best chase scene I had seen to date (although for special effects sake and shock & awe value the highway scene from Bad Boys 2 might've beaten this).

The Wachowski brothers have done a good job of bringing what I think is an intricate storyline, to life. Although it may appear at first glance that this movie is full of eye-candy fight and chase sequences, I believe there is a story here muddled among the various new characters that we meet along the way. After watching this, I ask myself, what is truth anyways? The storyline has been crafted in such a way that you simply can't understand the depth of the story until you see the third installment, The Matrix Revolutions.So, for now, hang on, experience on-screen effects at their best, and watch it again in October to prepare yourself for the revelation.

Some people don't accurately recollect why they liked ""The Matrix"".
Matrix is a very thin movie with many cheesy moments.  It was what it was - a creative, unique, introductory action film.  It was not an epic, and it certainly did not have a very detailed story.  To claim that Reloaded ""doesn't live up to the original"" is preposterous.  Reloaded takes the themes and ideas of the original and expands them many times over. Further, there is simply no comparison between the action in Matrix v. Reloaded. It is more complex and dynamic in Reloaded.  If you don't believe me, watch Matrix again.2.  The dialogue was operating at a level far above the intellectual capabilities of many people who saw this movie.I often hear people say they want intelligent, thoughtful action films. Well, here it is - just about as intelligent and thoughtful as action films are ever going to be, and then its attacked for have ""boring"" dialogue, with ""too much"" philosophy.  I found the conversations, ideas, and concepts in Reloaded to be fascinating and addicting to listen to.  I didn't want the conversations to end.3.  Some sci-fi fans will only accept their vision of the future.
The W brothers gave you their vision of the future.  Whether WE liked it or not didn't matter one lick to them.  I found the Zion celebration to be fascinating.  How do you know how you would party if you were part of the final 250,000 humans on earth?  And what was wrong with Morpheus' speach? I thought it was powerful, concise, and accomplished its goal.
Last thought - any suggestion that the ONLY reason the W Brothers cast a large number of African Americans was because they seem ""cool"" is disgusting.  The acting in this movie was of the highest quality, and the W Brothers should be commended for having a vision of the future where white people don't run everything.  My question is where are the Latinos and Asians?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So, I was a little worried when I started hearing some not so great things about this movie. I went in the theater with a little trepidation.I came out knowing I'd have to see this movie again, and soon!Let me just say that the talk about how slow the first hour is and all the philisophical mumbo-jumbo had me worried that someone had taken Wakng Life and made it into an action flick! And while the first hour is a bit tedious, and philosophy is certainly discussed, it was nowhere near as bad as the critics said! And once the 100 Agent Smiths fight comes around, this movie kicks in to full bad-ass gear and delivers the goods til the end!
Now, I can't say it was as good as the first movie (nothing is ever like your first time!), mainly because this movie takes a different path, one which I didn't quite count on, and which will require viewing the Third movie in six months.

How about get rid of all of the things that made your original film compelling and interesting in the first place. Much like George Lucas with the Star Wars prequels, The Wachowskis completely crashed and burned when given complete creative freedom. While many seem forgiving of the dull, bored filibuster of the first film, it does seem that audiences became more aware of it as the next few films rolled along. Another thing I find that made the sequels of The Matrix fail is the quick time in which they were made, I'm certain that either The Wachowskis weren't given enough time to work on their script or they put them out there without giving much thought, I don't know which option is more worrying, though I do lean on the first one considering that we know how excitable studios can get when they sniff success.Characters still talk in the same bored tone, most of the stuff that made the first film stand out are either never touched upon again or abandoned entirely, the action, while still well helmed, has no sense of tension, as Chris Stuckmann pointed out, when there's no tension in an action scene, it makes the scene pointless. While I could make the argument that since I don't care for the characters of the original Matrix, it makes the action of the original seem moot, but I do find that his point stands. The original Matrix's fight scenes have a respectable amount of tension and are carried out well. Sadly, there is none of this tension and suspense to be found throughout the other two Matrix films.Basically The Matrix becomes another, boring monomyth, with no variety or spirit behind it to make it work. But Britton, one might ask, you mention Star Wars so much, that's a monomythic story, what makes the Star Wars films so great and The Matrix so awful? Star Wars (at least the original films) had good characters, a good story, and a good team of creatives behind it making sure that the story was good enough for audiences to enjoy and suspend their disbelief enough to buy into. The Wachowskis, despite their proven talent, don't seem to be very concerned with such things. As in the first film, the Wachowskis have an obsession with being deep and meaningful, yet they never give anything to the audience to latch on to, which became more apparent as the next films rolled around.There are fun moments throughout the sequels, the aforementioned action is still well done, extravagant and full of energy, Hugo Weaving is a strong presence throughout the films, which is a point I forgot to bring up in my original Matrix review. Despite some of his sillier moments, Weaving brings a genuine sense of intimidation, though it's constantly undermined by poor writing. The philosophical call outs are intriguing, yet like the first film the Wachowskis never bother to do anything meaningful with them, rather than use it as a convenient plot device to cover up plot holes.If it were up to me, I'd probably stick to the first film and not bother with the rest, as at least the first Matrix can be fun to watch, if not extremely insulting to the audience and shamelessly knocking off better films, comics, and novels.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Good story. Decent Acting. Great Effects. Killer Ending.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0703640/?ref_=tt_urv","Iron Talon","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1756782/?ref_=tt_urv","16 May 2003","So the summer of sequels begins.  Some are legitimate extensions of an original story.  Some are just cheap copies of the first, a pathetic attempt by the Big Movie to rake in the dough.  The Matrix: Reloaded definitely falls in the first category.Firstly, if you haven't seen the first film, don't go see this one until you've rented first.  You will be lost, confused and probably emotionally scarred.  It doesn't pick up right where we left off, but it assumes you already know the main characters.  We have Neo (Keanu Reeves), Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss), Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), and the new bad guy you love to hate, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving).  We are introduced to a number of new characters, too many to mention, who help us dig deeper into the Matrix world. We are taken into the Matrix, onto various ships, including the Nebuchadnezzer, and into the real world.   Again, Neo, the Messiah of the film (or as another character refers to him as ""The Anomaly"") is the main focus.  He's supposed to save the humans from the machines.  Things build from there, with some interesting twists and turns.This movie is very heady.  Matrix I had a lot of metaphors, analogies, and references to religion and philosophy - including Christianity.  This means Matrix II has all the more.  Here you get caught in extended philosophical discussions between characters.  If you're not paying attention, it will overwhelm you.  These discussions, though may seem slow, are essential to the story.  Unlike most movies, this one does have a point and the Warchowski are going to make sure you get the whole picture.  There is some references to Christianity, eastern mysticism, Buddhism, and a hodgepodge of philosophy.  It will probably take more than one viewing to absorb it all and figure out what belief is part of which system.Now this film is heady, but don't worry, Hollywood didn't leave out the eye candy.  If you pay attention, you'll notice everyone in Zion (yes, we get to see Zion) is good looking and at the right weight.  Very realistic. (Please note sarcasm)Once again the brothers are pushing the envelope with special effects. Don't worry.  They succeed.  The Burly Brawl was intense.  If you're concerned about spending money on this film, the entire freeway scene is worth the price of admission alone.  Everything is well choreographed and very intense.  You get engulfed.  You're immersed.  You have to see what will happen next.  And, there is one part of the Freeway Scene that just nails what your thinking - hint:  it's with Link.Acting is on par with other quality films.  I still find Keanu a little plastic.  I think he's trying to be stoic.  But he does a decent job.  He is Neo.  There can be no other.  Everyone seemed to gel.  No one seemed disconnected from another.  Everyone was working together.The story does get a little slow with all the dialogue, but its OK.  The story still moves, doesn't get to the point of dragging.  I did realize this is a kind of Terminator meets Tron meets your-college-philosophy-prof movie. An interesting mix.Over all this is a good film.  It's enjoyable.  It has a cliff-hanger ending.  It's a good thing we only have to wait six months for Matrix III. Another three years would be too long of a wait.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Which is a shame, because on its own, Reloaded is a roller coaster ride of a film with spectacular effects, great actions sequences, an intelligent plot, and a twist ending. But when taken as a sequel to the modern masterpiece The Matrix, the movie may seem sub-par. Parts of the film drag and the emotional investment in the characters is not as strong as the first film. The plot will definitely be too intelligent for many people. I don't say this to brag, but it has shown to do so already. I have heard many people complaining cause they just don't understand the plot, Neo's inner struggle, the technical issues, and the battle between control and choice. Reloaded is a masterful film, the Wachowskis own film to end all films so to speak. It is meant to be a somewhat intellectual action oriented sci-fi romantic war film, and it does each thing and still entertains, and I loved it. Some scenes are hit and miss, but the film is a great continuation of the original, and if the third follows the story arc as well as the second, it will be a masterpiece trilogy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With that said, let me say something about the movie.When I first saw it, i thought it was great. I didn't know anything about the plot and I didn't read reviews about this film, because i wanted to see it with an open mind, I wanted to judge it by myself. And I think that was a good decision. By now I have seen this film two times in a cinema and several times on DVD and I have to say it is a great movie, a masterpiece! It takes the whole story on a higher level. And that's the problem that many people have with this film. They just don't get it, they don't understand it. Many of my friends didn't even get the story of the original Matrix when they saw it the first time. And this time the story is even more complex and harder to understand, because there are so many details in this film, and you just have to see it several times, and even if you do, there is no guarantee that you will fully understand it. Another thing, many people had a problem with, is the fact that this is just the first part of one movie. Because I believe that you can't figure the story out by watching just the second installment. The first movie was complete. It had a beginning and an end. People didn't know and didn't expect a second and even a third part. Now, Reloaded hasn't a clear beginning and it surely has no end. And many seem to have a problem with this. You just have to wait for the last part. But even then I don't expect everyone to figure everything out.About the action - it's just great. An improvement to the first film. The choreography of the fighting is something I have never seen before in a movie (well, Tiger and Dragon was pretty cool, too). Maybe some fights are a bit too long, but thats something I can live with. The freeway chase is simply a true masterpiece of mindbending action, and it is again something I have never seen before. My mouth was the 14 minutes that it takes wide open, because I just couldn't believe that it is possible to shoot such scenes.To all who haven't seen the film yet, I would recommend to see it with an open mind. Don't trust all the bad reviews. I believe that you will be compelled to stay in front of your TV, even long after the credits began. And if you saw it, wait for revolutions and then you can decide whether you'll like it or not.9/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Most of the negative comments I've seen >about Reloaded were due to the writer simply not understanding an element of the film, which means that once enough people explain it to them slowly, they'll probably enjoy it a lot more.My main problem with the film, aside from the occasional cheesey line or scene (which you have to expect from a sci fi flick anyway) is the absolutely terrible soundtrack. Not the score to the film as such, which was okay, but the album. Once again, like the first Matrix, it is filled with crappy 'angry white boy' pop like linkin park, POD, marylin manson and so on. I mean come on, maybe I'm being a little pretentious here, but do they honestly think they're being 'edgy' or 'underground' with a soundtrack like that? It's Britney Spears for teenage boys. The Matrix are innovative films, and they deserve a more innovative, genuinely dark soundtrack. Imagine the ending credits set to Joy Division's 'Interzone' or 'Glass' instead of tired old Rage Against The Machine. Imagine those graceful fight scenes set to the climax of Moya by Godspeed You Black Emperor. Now THAT would be amazing.Anyway kids, let me know what you think.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Waiting for such a long time for it, i really thort they chose the wrong direction for story went.The 1st matrix left us with such a broad story to be carried on and to carry on like this i wasnt impressed.Lets get one thing straight, the action scenes were AWESOME!! (especially the collision of the 2 lorries on the freeway in slow motion), but i realised today that action isnt all that makes a movie an awesome one itself.It really depends on how u look at the 2nd one when u try to put ur opinions forward of it. Are u lookin at the movie in COMPARISON WITH THE 1ST ONE or are u lookin at the movie generally as a movie? i just couldnt avoid making a comparison with the first one, which is prolly why i was slightly disappointed with the outcome.the action scenes were awesome like i said b4, but did ne1 find TOOO MUCH action just slightly starting to get boring? they shoulda concentrated on a better storyline i think.having said that, mebbe my disappointment will be compensated for the 3rd one, because this second one is just the intermediate to link the 1st and the 3rd matrix movies, and so this 2nd is prolly building up to the 3rd one, which, im hoping, will meet my expectations. its like lotr: i thort the 1st one was much better than the 2nd, but the 2nd one is prolly leading the final 3rd one, which should be awesome.i am still confused about the movie (e.g. the 'creator of the matrix' talked soooo fast, and with such advanced vocabulary, i was all confused there and then) so my comments towards movie may have been too early to tell.all in all, i dont think the matrix 2 was a s*** movie. it didnt meet my expectations and was nowhere near the 1st one's quality. i cannot wait for the dvd so that a lot of gaps are filled. (gaps such as when Neo somehow stops those flying robot thingies with some kind of power in the REAL WORLD and not in the matrix. that made me all confused thinking that the REAL WORLD may also be some type of a matrix?! help?)feel free to criticise, agree, disagree, or support my points :)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I can only put down their disappointment to one of two things...1.  They have not seen the first Matrix or it has been such a long time since they have seen it that they cannot remember the integral pieces of the plot, hence they were confused...and/or2.  They went in thinking it will be a simple good guy / bad guy movie with a fairy tale ending like most simplistic movies.I noticed that some critics argued that the fight scenes were unrealistic. That is the whole point..once you are in the world of the matrix it is a make believe world, and if you are able to ""free your mind"" you can do ""unreal"" things like fly around etc...get with the programme guys!!To be fair as well, Matrix Reloaded can only be fully understood once the third instalment is seen, Revolutions.Overall, a great movie with a fairly deep plot, and deserves to be seen again to deepen one's understanding.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Considering all of the hype behind this movie and fact that the basic premise isn't as novel after four years, this movie upholds its original standard well. My only criticism is that in an effort to ""one up"" the first film it extended fight scenes a bit to long and slightly misused the bullet time effect. In the first film bullet time helped draw you into the scene building on anticipation, in this application it as if the timing is slightly off--slowing down some of the scenes. Nonetheless everything looks great and scenes are well acted. Pay attention to Gloria Foster's (The Oracle) scene with Neo in the courtyard--its one of the best in the movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The original offered a toe in the water for the metaphysical branch of philosophy, and mysticism in religion, and this was the first time most people had been presented with such things.  The second merely took this further, and offered the film as the second part of a (potentially) ongoing series (viewers of the Animatrix will surely respect this).So, what's the problem (apart from the rave, obviously)?As an individual with a reasonable education in the areas of both mysticism and metaphysics, I can honestly say that this second installment was truly intelligent and honest.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Disapointing. First of all the 10 minute sex scene was very graphic and very unnecessary. Secondly, while the fight scenes are awesome, they were not vital to story line or plot line...why didn't Neo fly away from the Agent Smiths in the first place? Why did Neo need to fight The Oracle's guard? Why did there even need to be a guard in the first place? But I must admit that the plot goes deep and is interesting to discuss and try to figure out afterwards. However, as Rob VanLandingham put it in the newspaper, ""it is not as mysterious anymore...the second part of a trilogy is usually weak."" My closing remark is this: Good plot, superb fight scenes, even okay acting, but why does Neo have powers outside of the Matrix?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie actually exceeded my expectations and the trilogy is looking to be the best ever made.The action scenes were the best I'd ever seen and really make you look on in awe. The entire cast has gotten alot better at fighting(or, at least, appeared to) and the fights are very elaborate but never to much. I don't think anyone can deny that even if they don't like the story and meaning of existance stuff that the action scenes alone are more than worth the price of admission.The special effects are spectacular and really add to the movie. There are a couple points when you can tell that something is CGI, but it still very good and doesn't detract from the movie.There are points in the movie where it slows down and the first showing feels kinda long, but my friends and I all agreed that the second viewing went by alot faster.The story is very complicated and I know alot of people will complain about not understanding it or say it was needlessly to complicated, but I really enjoy a great action movie that is smart and has story. There are points where the characters just talk forever and it is hard to try and keep up with all the big words. You be thinking about it all at the end trying to wrap your brain around everything, but it is all good and is not stupid. It is mostly complicated because we discover things with the characters and we will learn alot of the answers in Revolutions when they learn them.Do not expect a complete movie. Reloaded is like The Two Towers and other middle films of planned trilogies. It does not have an ending and alot of plotlines are left unresolved. I don't think you can truly judge the movie until the Revolutions comes out and completes the trilogy.Go see the movie for the incredible action and you get a great story that trys to make you think.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was obvious that the plot was going to suck, so I just hoped for a good action movie...  But they failed to do that as well. I've seen many bad movies with great action... but this was just bad bad.  It was basically the same special effects as the first movie and it was not so ""special"".  The action scenes were too long and repetitive.  There were many scenes like this and they were all the same.  The love story that they tried to throw in there did not work either.  Some parts were so ridiculous and stupid that everybody in the theater was like, ""what the heck is this?"" and started to laugh or complain to their friends.  I almost laughed out loud because it was just so bad.Overall I was very boring during the whole movie and to top it off, the ending was horrible.  I wanted to walk out of this movie, but I stayed because I wanted to see how it would end...  But the ending was definitely not worth staying for.  I was pretty p***ed off when I was leaving, and a lot of other people seemed pretty angry at the film too...  I overheard a bunch of people talking.So don't see this movie if you are expecting a good movie or just a plain good action movie, because you will not be satisfied.  Maybe the only reason to see it is because maybe it's worth it to see such a bad movie. good luck.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

And some very cool fight sequences, as well as probably the best car chase scene Hollywood will ever see. But all that aside Reloaded does not out-due it's predecessor. The original Matrix had a lot going for it that this doesn't and one is the always important element of surprise that most sequels suffer from. Second is the plot, the plot from The Matrix was one of the most original ideas in cinema history, Reloaded was packed with action that went by all too fast leading to the slow, drawling dialogues and explanations.From the start it was evident that this would not be as original as well, the original. Reloaded jumps right into everything all too fast and doesn't bother to explain many new things at all. All the Zion scenes were mostly unnecessary junk, that got a little bit too Star Wars Prequel-like. And emphasis on certain things from the original is lost on this one, like how each time in the first movie they would have to struggle to find an exit from the Matrix, and show them going into it. Whereas in Reloaded, they're just in and out with no transition. Plus where it begins it expects us to understand the way things work in Zion andthat there was a fleet of ships rather than the Nebuchadnazzer being original, or how Neo has learned all of these new tricks in a very short period of time, and everyone on all ships know who he is now. The plot elements are lost and jumbled up as well, and some pretty stupid concepts are introduced during the architect scene. But even so some things were left very unclear. And the hyped-up cliffhanger wasn't really as powerful as it was made out to be. All in all, the action was awesome, the dialogue was mostly bad as well as Real World scenes.

Well, on the special effects almost nobody complained and they are certainly among the very best ever seen on the big screen. I especially like the effects you DIDN'T see... Did you notice how the camera worked during the car chase scene? It went right through other cars in order to follow the main action in a straight line - impossible but ingenious.Now the main complaints obviously were with the story line. Well, people, let me remark that this is not a kid's movie despite it's rating and you need a certain intelligence and background to digest what is thrown at you. And this is what they do, they throw little morsels of information and philosophy at you (or big chunks sometimes, there are at least 2 longer monologues) and leave it up to you to interpret it. Obviously your average american schoolkid with an x-men background will be unable to do so and will feel left out in the open.But for the somewhat broader minded this movie will be a thrill ride, not only because of the awesome action but also because of the mind fodder it gives you. My head is still spinning from weighing the concept of possible realities and greater schemes behind it all. And phrases like ""It's like wiping your ass with silk"" sounds like something Oscar Wilde would have said.Yes, the brothers definitely know their classics and their drama theory. Like George Lucas did with the first 3 Star Wars, the 2nd installment of the 3-part-drama is the Action part, after we had the Mystery part.It is pure joy to see how they build up the story line. First, lulling us in security, showing joy and confidence like in the infamous dance scene, demonstrating Neo's super-powers only to plunge us into utter despair at the end and question the whole concept of reality all over again.I fully expected an open end because if you only have to wait 5 months for the next part, what better way to keep us on the edge.And, by the way... has anyone thought that ""The One"" might have a double meaning? The religious meaning as in ""saviour"" is a human interpretation but that is not how a machine would think. One in a binary sense is also the counterpart of Zero... I'll let you make your own sense of that.The only thing I hope for is that we will get an Extended Director's Cut on DVD that will take more time with dialogues.See you in 5 months!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I knew that I would somehow be disappointed...but I never realized the magnitude of that disappointment.  This movie was awful compared to the first one and mediocre on its own merits.  It had none of the respect/seriousness of The Matrix. I understand the writers desire to delve more deeply into the personal interactions between the characters...but I felt that they strayed too far off the original concept and ""cheapened"" the experience.When The Matrix first came out, I remember everyone talking about the intelligent philosophies integrated into the plot.  It was smart, witty, and surprised audiences.  Reloaded did none of these things.  With its over-the-top and stereotypical villains, over reliance on CGI effects, needless emotional baggage, and really crappy jokes...it reminded me more of what I would expect from The Mummy 2, Blade, or some other campy flick. Which would have been o.k. except that we all expected more than that.Oh, and in addition to the bad jokes, be prepared to see a T and A filled danced scene straight out of Blade 2, line/scenario repeats from the first Matrix (which aren't as funny or cool the second time around), and some suck-face/sex scenes between Neo and Trinity (who had tons of chemistry between until the writers put them into needless soft porn situations). I'm not being a prude about it.  There are plenty of movies in which nudity is essential or conveys chemistry and longing...but in this case it did the opposite:  it trivialized what was already there and which needed no ""spicing up"".","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Not only does the second film of the trilogy leave you hanging on the edge of your seat with the famous `To be Concluded' the script was horribly written. I must admit, Reloaded has awesome effects, far superb than the first Matrix. However, it lacks that awe and sense of wonder as the movie progresses. Neo (Keanu Reeves) has practically less than 10 linesThe script and plot are the downfall to the movie. Not only that, but every fighting scene leaves the audience thinking: `been there, done that' The movie is not boring, but it does lag, especially at every dialog between characters. The fighting scenes between Agent Smith(s) and Neo was amazing, the car chase on the freeway was interesting, but not compelling. Neo's powers as `The One' get more exuberant and elaborate every time he uses him. His flying ability is overused and by the last time he uses it you just breathe a sigh of relief. Through out the movie, the every little twist that happens in the plot that proves that Neo is the One is overwhelming and overused. Every impossible situation is always solved by Neo. Matrix Reloaded lacks the certain charm and amazement that viewers encountered while watching The Matrix. Due to the elaborate fighting scenes which were compelling in the first movie, the second basically redoes the same thing, this time with out guns (remember Neo dodging the bullets, well in the second movie nothing like that every happens, its just all hand to hand combat). The movie's action scenes make up for the dull script, especially when viewers encounter the lines of ` cause and effect'and scenes are extremely choppy.Matrix Reloaded can not be compared to any other movies that are coming out this year or have already come out. The Matrix Trilogy are a legend in their own kind, a phenomenon, and perhaps the reason viewers can be agitated by the second movie is due to the dull script, Matrix 1 makes up for it I can't advise not seeing this movie, because if you don't you will miss a loton the other hand, I'm irritated by the plot and the dialog that I want to say: Skip it. But alas, I shall say `watch it' just because you might be `wowed' byt the action scenes, and if you have seen the first Matrix, you don't want to miss out on any part. X-Men 2 is probably a better movie, because of the plot and actors. But you can't compare X2 to Matrix 2 because Matrix is given a lot of leeway which allows it to do have mind boggling fight scenes because the encounters are always in the Matrix.  Where as X2, you don't fight in a computer or machine, but hand to hand combat (vicious in Wolverine's case) Again, X2 is not necessarily the better movie (but is in my opinion it is compared to the Matrix 2) but it is the better sequel. By that I mean that it is better than its predecessor is. Matrix Reloaded was a disappointment, its was definitely overhyped and lacked plot.All in all, I give Matrix Reloaded a B+, an 8 out of 10, and 3.5 stars out of ***** Hopefully, Matrix Revolutions which comes out in November 5, will fare better both in plot and in action. Oh yeah, remember WB decided to do what it did for Harry Potter, there will be a preview of Matrix Revolutions after the credits so stay after to view it","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There is a difference in the reasoning of this, though. With the first one, people were expecting garbage, so that's all they chose to see. Now that ""The Matrix"" has achieved such high status in pop culture and become so critically acclaimed, they like it because they knew there had to be something good in there and now they see it. With the first long-awaited sequel, ""The Matrix: Reloaded"", any bit of straying from the original formula will result in so-called disappointment. What the Wachowskis have done, in typical brilliant fashion, is defy all formulaic conventionalities of the sequel, where the same story is simply used over again and stretched out beyond boredom and predictability. They have completely changed the face of the Matrix universe and in huge plot twists, altered everything you think you know. We come to the movies to be surprised, don't we? What fun would ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" be if all the humans do is free more minds and do more kung-fu simulations and in the end, Neo discovers that all we need to do is dump water on the machines and cause them to short-circuit? The tagline of the movie, ""Free Your Mind"" was a message for the audience to throw their expectations out the window. I have to admit, when I first saw the movie, I thought, ""What the hell? This is too convoluted and too much!"" But I was wrong as multiple viewings of ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" continue to be fascinating, thought provoking, and brilliantly noodle-cooking. This is truly the most re-watchable movie ever made. Many things are still ambiguous, but I consider this just one half of one really long sequel, so I expect things to be all wrapped up, come November. Don't expect ""The Matrix"", expect something else entirely. But man is it good! 10/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Wow... with the limited expectations I had I couldn't believe how poor this stinker really was.The first Matrix should have been left alone, just like the original Star Wars did not need Lucas to help the world understand his glory by creating Duds Episode One and Two. Well, thanks to the Wachowskis, we now have Phantom Menace 2003. But give Lucas credit -- at least the plot made sense and you understood the awful dialogue.The opening scene gives away the entire movie -- Trinity does her kick ass routine with the special effects that made the Matrix interesting. Do we really need to see this opening... again? Ah yes, of course, since this time it's longer and provides even more special fx. Wowee.Run into long first hour with nothing but boring shots of Zion, pontificating, speeches with powerful words that could be summed up in a sentence, and the lust between Trinity and Neo that is a relationship colder than the colors in this film.Now let's get to the plot. Agent Smith now talks some gobbledygook about being released from the machine which means he can replicate himself. Uh... didn't we see something like this in the first movie? If the machines could send ""sentinels"" why couldn't the matrix send 1,000 of them? Of course they could but there wouldn't be any suspense in the fighting scenes. But I digress because people here actually think they ""got"" the brilliance of the film.We introduce several new characters who ultimately seem to have nothing to do with the story and will undoubtedly appear for cameos in the final film, those being Merivingian and the twins. Were they needed? No, but the Wachowskis decided that the Matrix needed to have a diabolical villian for a really cool, long fight and car chase.Visiting the Oracle again... no spoiler but suffice it to say that there is a little twist thrown in but nothing overwhelming. More confusing nonsense about metaphysics, choice, fate, blah, blah, blah. Then we hear more about some absolutely preposterously absurd plot about what it really all means. My thought was -- you MUST be joking. After the great idea in the original film it all comes down to this stinker?Make no mistake. This is not a thought provoking film and all the philosophical debate in the film does not make it any smarter than this film is. It's an excuse to make another Matrix film. The money was just so big so it was going to be done, as was the third. My guess is that if the box office is big for the third, the Wachowskis will begin to do the trilogy that happened before the original Matrix and this series will be known as The Matrix episodes IV, V, and VI.Pros - nice effects, style, high budget production. Cons - dumb film with few redeeming moments, first hour boring as hell, overlong effects and fights to cover up the lack of plot, zero true character development, some pretty bad dialogue, second rate acting, and a story intended to confuse so it can have teenagers yapping about something that they think is deep. Pathetic. Insulting. Happy as heck I didn't have to pay to see this tripe.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Obviously with any sequel it's tough to produce a quality next instalment that embodies the soul and style of the original without just copying it.The original Matrix, IMO, was a masterpiece, not just for it's ground breaking effects or style, but more for the idea and depth of the story.  No matter how many times I see the film, there is always some new little snippet of dialog or image, that re-enforces the theme of the film.Now to capture that again, would be extremely difficult.  We already know about the Matrix, it is no longer a surprise.  We already know that Neo is the one' and now has less vulnerability than in the original.  To just present Neo's struggle between the real world' and the Matrix again, would be pointless.  Unfortunately this is where most of the criticism come from. Rather the same as Back to the Future, the film wasn't about time-travel, it was about the charm of the 50's.  This was completely missed in the sequels.Anyway I digress.  For me this film was excellent, the pure vision and effort that had gone into the planning of every scene and every camera angle was simply breathe-taking.  I would even go so far as saying a new milestone in action movies, the bar has been lifted once more.  Even after a poor start to the film the story started to gain pace and actually become an excellent social comment about the world, people and our perception of ourselves.  Countless references to history, human weakness and purpose. 
The most important thing, was the fact I got caught up in the movie, by the end and as a cynical 32 year old, that's rare thing.  The only downside to the film, was the rather pointless dance scene at the beginning, but I can forgive that.  Vastly superior in every way to the very average LOTR films, just disappointed that the current rating doesn't reflect what a good film this really was.Can't wait until November.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The storyline was brilliant but I think that it's necessary for anyone who hasn't seen The Matrix to do so before going to see Reloaded to make some sense of the story.  Keanu Reeves (Neo), Carrie-Anne Moss (Trinity), Laurence Fishburne (Morpheus), & Hugo Weaving's (The Agent's Smith) acting talents are up to their usual brilliant standards.  The special effects are phenomenal.What I am glad about is that Reloaded doesn't try to outdo The Matrix but instead supplements it very well (which is more than can be said for some sequels where they try to repeat what has come before).  The fight sequences are very well choreographed (the stand out for me is the Neo and Agent Smiths' fight).  The car chase is well executed and some of the stunts performed during it are great!I bought Enter The Matrix for the PC and I played that first before going to see Reloaded and was absolutely amazed at how well it ties into the film. It adds some extra storyline to it.  But it is not necessary to play Enter The Matrix before going to see Reloaded.The Matrix Reloaded gets a great big 10/10 from me and I know that when this gets released on DVD and Video it will make a great addition to anyone's collection.

It was like a sci-fi/action high budget C movie (worse)! I thought the first Matrix was one of the most intelligent and philosophical films of our time, but Reloaded was a joke. Out of respect for the first one, I was actually preparing myself not to expect too much. 30 minutes passed and indeed I was starting to get disappointed; so I thought I should give it a chance, it would probably get better after a few more scenes -- didn't happen. All I got was horrible and predictable dialogue, ""what the #@*!/we get the point"" action scenes, poor editing, and a plot that seemed to have been thought over half a coffee break.

Of course, the mind-blowing experience of the first Matrix could not possibly be repeated but still I think it was a good film. The first 40 minutes or so, however, were terribly boring and absolutely superfluous - the Wachowski brothers could have used the money and screen time for something else. Especially cheesy were the scenes with the ""fan club"" of Neo and the ""they need you / I need you"" line - as if we have forgotten that we are watching a Hollywood production.The rave scene at Zion was also absolutely pointless, not to mention the fact that at certain moments Zion reminded me of a number of other films seen before. I mean, the Wachowski brothers have shown that they have the vision and imagination to come up with something better than that.Fortunately in the Reloaded there were certain attempts for comic relief, which against the background of the dark future and the upcoming major battle were very welcome. I truly enjoyed the gallery of new characters in Reloaded.I very much hope to get to see The Twins in the last part - I found them quite amusing. The ""Burly Brawl"" scene and the highway chase were by far the two peaks in the movie and are definitely worth every cent spent on them.In conclusion, I can hardly wait for the conclusion of the trilogy and in the meantime will perhaps go several more times to see Reloaded.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I had high hopes, since I've been looking out fot this movie for like 3 months. So I bought the tickets 2 weeks before the release just to make sure I would get in. Yes, I'm a fan. I think the movie was absolutly brilliant, I loved it from beginning till end. Starting with a scene somewhat similar to the one in the  first Matrix since Trinity is kicking some serious ass, this film clings you to the screen. The fights are superb, I've never seen anything like this in my live. Of course there's alot of computer work in it, but you don't really notice that, it still looks realistic.I wasn't the only one in the audience who thought about it that way because multiple times the crowd spontaneously started to clap. So the fighting, stunts and car chases are 5*. The story :Sentinels are digging there way through the earth to destroy Zion. Our heroes have 72 hours to stop them. They have to find the keymaker to get to the Source and destroy the Matrix, will they succeed...? I think that the story is less cause the philosophy is a bit over the top. Sometimes dialogues are hard to comprehend, and you sort of lose your concentration. Especially when a conversation starts with a corny sentence like : Why are we here?. The dialogues are sometimes corny and boring, but sometimes witty and sometimes even funny. You get to laugh more in this one than in the first. The actors do a pretty good job, Keanu Reeves IS the One, I can't imagine anyone else playing him. The love between him and Carrie Ann Moss's Trinity is believable and Morpheus is a true leader. Agent Smith is climbing his way to the top of best villains ever. The newcomers Niobe (Jada pinkett Smith) and Persephone (Monica Belucci) add an extra, especially Monica Belucci who steals the scenes she's in. Another thing I loved were the outfits, they are just perfect, and create a certain mood. So overall I loved the movie, I can understand that some people, especially the critics, are somewhat disappointed. But that's because they keep comparing it to part 1. The Matrix was new and original, of course the sequel isn't as much of that, but how can you expect that? It's a sequel so you can't come up with another new philosophy and a whole new storyline. They also say there isn't something new in it like bullet time, there wrong there is this whole new thing with visual graphics and it isn't a obvious as bullet time but it is there. The fights are much better than in the firstI'm going again! 4,5* out of 5*","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I have to say that it was worth what I paid for it.... nothing.Funny how so many of these people think this movie is 'mindblowing' because it discusses philosophical concepts. Unfortunately the story line is an excuse to force great sounding round concepts into a square plot.Somehow the machines found Zion, perhaps the Palestinians alerted them (Get it? That's a deep, subtle reference too.) Long boring emotional speeches using optimistic euphamisms only spoken from Hollywood. Throw in plot twist and the most superficial coverage of characters I have ever seen. If you want character development, this is definitely not your movie. In fact, I'd say this movie regresses and you know (and think) even less of the characters that you saw in the first, especially Trinity and especially Morpheus, who was most compelling and is now reduced to Sideshow Bob.The movie continues to CGI graphics up the wazoo, which makes you wonder (1) if the matrix is nothing but a mind game, why did Neo have to fly for miles just to get to the 'action scene' -- why not be there instantly, and (2) why the heck doesn't Neo just fly away every time he gets in trouble because we know he can't 'beat them' by just handfighting with everyone. Ridiculous. This isn't deep, it's Hollywood fx to keep the kiddies happy and the video game commercials rolling.Part three: Some ridiculous interlude with a Frenchman and two cool looking dudes. Why this had to be in the film probably had a lot more to do with current events than ingenuity. I had no idea why Persephone's character mattered at all and how much she gave up 'for a kiss.' It was a poor excuse to throw in something that seemed clever along with a line I'm sure the Wachowski's were yukking up saying 'we GOTTA stick this line in somewhere because it's too good to waste!!!'OK, part three. This could have been somewhat interesting but by this point, who cares? The part with the oracle and the creator were slightly interesting but also more blockheaded philosphy. The first matrix was interesting because we didn't know what it was. This film tries to capture the same sensation but instead throws existentialist questions at us all at one time, giving us the same thought provoking self analysis of the universe as we heard when the students were smoking pot in ""Animal House.""End of movie throws in a plot twist with Agent Smith... yes, we know where this is going now in the finale. It's like a TV episode of Star Trek TNG. Why the sidekick was in the movie at the beginning and end is beyond me because he played no part and was just annoying. Yes, we do know what will happen in Part III -- the issue of Morpheus' ex-girlfriend (how riveting, I could't care less because we never saw any exchange or development of it in this movie), more of Neo and Trinity's growing lust (oops, love, but I didn't see any of that did you?), more fights with a more powerful agent smith (coming to Playstation IV), and some more incomprehensible dialogue with the designer of the matrix (which made some sense but the choices were not correct, predictable, as are this movie.)So what are we left with? A movie that tries so hard to be clever with subtle references that it misses the mark on the most important part of the movie -- a comprehensible plot that flows, character development, a good script, and a cohesive and compelling story. Choice is an illusion if you feel compelled to see this movie, however, given the detailed reviews one might say that this is a rental at best and part 3 is irrelevant already... the Matrix is a movie that never should have had a sequel but with the moneymaking potential we may have a dozen...","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

So give Reloaded a chance and watch it. 8/10 watch it if you're a matrix fan like me.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

To me, what this sequel does is take an interesting idea and screw it up by  overloading our senses with pictures, action and sound.  I was so distraught by watching this movie and trying to figure out what it was all about that I really didn't want to watch it to the end.  I was able to take a couple bathroom breaks and the theatre had a few false fire alarms which made it a little more bearable, I guess.  And what's worse is that they end it with a `To be continued.' (which means, of course, that I may have to bear this again).  I'm sorry but I didn't like the first one and I don't like this one either.  What makes movies interesting to me is the stories not wondering how they accomplished the technical things.  This is the only thing interesting about this movie(the special effects- the wow, how did they do that? thought), but by the end your saying - who cares?  As you can see, I didn't care for this but I have to admit that the effects were spectacular(even Oscar-worthy).","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Oracle: Same reason. I love candy.Everybody was shocked and surprised after they saw The Matrix (1999). It had an amazing opening, jaw-dropping special effects and an original plot to die for. Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) became a well known modern bad-guy and Keanu Reeves was turned in to a true Hollywood star. I'd doubt that anyone hated the first film. It was just far too unique and amazing and could be compared to the likes of Star Wars. Now it seems the sole film will become a trilogy within a year, and the question many people are asking is if it was a decent idea. The Matrix: Reloaded answers any questions you have about the film. What was the answer?A new plot is started in Reloaded. As told in The Matrix, there is only one surviving human city named Zion. Zion is heavily relied on as it preserves 250,000 humans who survived the start of the war (Machine VS Man). The story of Reloaded begins in the mini series, Animatrix. A ship and it's crew, named Osiris, are chased up to the surface of Earth where they find the machines are beginning to drill down towards Zion along with 250,000 sentinel machines. One sentinel for each human. The Osiris crew quickly alarm Zion before falling from sentinel attacks. This is where the film, Reloaded, starts. While on their way back to Zion, Neo (played by Keanu Reeves) begins to have dreams of his lover's (Trinity played by Carrie Anne Moss) fate, which doesn't seem to be a great one. Morpheus (played my Laurence Fishburne) begins to rely on the proficy to save mankind from the threat the machines are sending, and a time limit is set for how long they have to save Zion. Unfortunately for Neo, Morpheus believes Neo is the only person who can save Zion, as Neo, now The One, has complete power over The Matrix. And so they set off on their adventure, meeting new enemies and even more Agents and introducing a new operator named Link.Reloaded takes a while to start the action, beginning with a 30 minute segment where Zion and other crews are introduced to the viewer. But once the 30 minutes are over the viewer is pretty munched, with Neo, dropped in to an all action movie with kung-fu fighting, inspired by comics and other films, and the greatest special effects and CGI you will ever see in a decade. There are fight scenes which honestly could compete for the greatest film scenes ever. However, it seems the movie has been slightly hyped up. There are some scenes which seem to go on forever, pretty much explaining every single little detail about what the film's based around and having static lectures for roughly 10 minutes, which isn't really very thrilling at all. I also realized, except for Neo's dreams of Trinity's fate always flashing back, there never seems to be much suspense. The end is also slightly confusing for the dim-minded.. As well as putting on a cliff-hanger which will make you want to swear at the Wachowski Brothers. Although most of the action scenes make up for this anyway. I honestly don't think i can judge this film properly, as the follow up to it (named The Matrix: Revolution) needs to explain what the hell was going on in Reloaded as the plot simply just cuts off at the end with a nice ""To be concluded"" message. Reloaded has many ups and downs. Mostly ups, but the downs are quite big mistakes. However, i don't feel let down because i understand what was happening. While the action may of been excessive, it was all beautiful and amazingly crafted. None of it could be predicted, so came as a large surprise. BUT, there's too much static discussion and the story is incomplete which may let down people a lot.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The reason the first one was so popular was because of the weirdum and the fact that it made you think about life, this sequel holds none of this ""weirdum"" and therefore brings it down alot. The action is great, it holds most of the action bits for a good time of that being fairly long. Also the sex scene and big club thing made no point and made the film more uncivilized and showed that the human race survivors are idiots (wouldn't they all run off and get ready for the war?) The graphics are like triple as good as the first one, (that involves those slow moving camera shots). The car chase also is a great and proberly one of the best we will ever see in Movie history for a long time to come, however in my point of view the final climax car chase in Mad Max 2:The Road Warrior is the best car chase ever made. Overall this film is a very good sequel, almost better than the original but because of its lack of meaning and power an focusing on action i say that it's worth watching and 8 1/2 outa 10, 'The Matrix' being 9 outa 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is a great tribute to the Hero's Journey, basically a plot that is over 2000 years old and just keeps on reoccurring over and over in media everywhere. Star Wars was one of the first modern movies to purposefully use it as a template. The Matrix is the second most popular to do so. And both movies prove how great the formula is, and why it was able to survive thousands of years. Sequels are where things get complicated. Movies that follow the Hero's Journey are very self- contained. Star Wars and the Matrix were designed to be stand-alone films. The Empire Strikes Back, sequel to Star Wars, was able to overcome that. It basically expanded upon the Hero's Journey, showing that Luke did not overcome everything yet. He is still a crappy Jedi who acts on emotions. All the tropes of the Hero's Journey are renewed to extend the story. These tropes include having a wise mentor and an evil enemy. Yoda replaces Obi-Wan as a wiser mentor and the Emperor is introduced as the greater enemy. The Matrix Reloaded does the opposite. Instead of expanding the Hero's Journey, it forgets it all together. Instead of being still an apprentice with a lot to learn, Neo is basically Super- Man/God. He is pretty much invincible. Nothing can kill him. This is the movie's biggest mistake. Neo is no longer a relatable, vulnerable, and still-learning main character. The worst part is the relatability of the Hero's Journey is its greatest strength. Next, the Matrix Reloaded does not have much of a story. It feels more like a video game. There are cutscenes to give you a quick idea of whats going on, then 30 minutes of action (which you can't even play). The action scenes are amazing, but I soon got really bored of them because they dragged and I couldn't be invested in the action because I didn't care about the characters. How could I care about a person I know can't die or people I never got to know. Also, the movie is not at all self-contained. The first part of the film sets up a ton of plot points that never resolve. There is no excuse for that. Even Lord of the Rings, a trilogy that continues exactly where it left off every film, has three self-contained films with a beginning, a middle, and an end.Second big mistake is its confusing. First, the movie does not introduce the concept of the Matrix or clearly show what it is. New viewers will not know what the Matrix is. Exposition is a necessity. It doesn't have to be in long monologues that explain everything, it can be just by showing how the Matrix works. Speaking of long monologues, this film has way too many of them. Characters continuously go on about nonsense. The Wachowskis tried to sound smart, but there's nothing smart about going on about nothing. Especially if its wasting my valuable time. Another thing is that whatever little story the movie has, it doesn't make sense. And trust me, I analyzed the entire Architect speech at the end, its not that part that confuses me. Its always the why. Why is never explained. Its always characters saying they don't know why, it just happened that way. Which is lazy screen writing. The way to make a universe fun and real is to create simple rules and stick to them. I'm going to go back to Star Wars: Star Wars is set in a futuristic setting, there is a magical field of energy called the force, and there are good and bad people who could use it. That's it. The movie sticks to these rules and everything works out fine.I think the highway scene really says everything that's wrong with this film. The high way scene is full of AMAZING stunt work and special effects. But I was bored after five minutes of it. Why?3 reasons: 1. I did not care for the characters, because I did not get to know them this time around 2. It was way too long 3. Way too many villains, why did the film have so many bad guys, it was like Spider-Man 3. Seriously, we have a computer program guy with two albino ghost henchmen, Mr Smith, and the computer agents. Once again, Star Wars: one villain named Darth Vader (until the last film, but that was okay because Darth Vader needed to kill him to redeem himself and all, it was necessary to the plot)So this film is a mess. I give an 8 on 10 to a film that tells a complete story, is self-contained (all plot lines resolved, everything has a purpose), and makes no huge mistakes. 7 out of 10 goes to a film that more or less gets it right, but maybe takes a few missteps. Most films I watch are 7 or 8. 6 is rare, its a film that gets enough wrong for it to be ruined. Then 5... 5 is a film that is a mess. It may still have one good thing to offer, but its bad enough to be not worth the watch. Matrix Reloaded gets a 5 out of 10Yeah the review was long, yeah it was pretentious, yeah I put no effort into the grammar, but its my honest opinion at the very least :PTo everyone in IMDb, stay classy.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie really kept me urging for more Matrix. The highway chase is a sequence to be reckoned with. Plus, Neo fighting the Smith's really impressed me in terms of ultimate fighting action. Unfortuately, it does have a few bugs to work out. The speeches given by the Supreme Councilor and especially the Architect really made me sleepy. It really is a waste of time. However, if you watch the parody done by MTV, featuring Justin Timberlake, Sean William Scott, and Will Farrel, you will appreciate the speeches better.See the movie, buy the Animatrix, and buy the Enter the Matrix Video game, and keep yourself occupied.

There are many arguments that Neo isn't as powerful as he should be and that the martial arts in the movie gets monotonous...which it might be for some people, but over all, I like the control the Wachowskis have on the story.  Many people also complain that there is too much philosophical talk without driving the plot forward, but I think they don't realize that that is the main point of the movie.  More than the physical war, this movie seems to flow from the opposing philosophical views of the machines and the humans.  And as much as that kind of story can be subject to b.s., the Wachowski's seem to have there head on straight in regards to having a solid philosophy for both sides throughout.  The Wachowski's are making very deliberate choices with story telling and part of the fun is trying to figure out where they are going with all of this.  There is a lot that is implied, but ultimately, we won't know what to think of all their hints and philosophy until the third installment.  Personally, I like where they're headed.  But...if Revolutions sucks...I might change my review of Reloaded...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was wrong, and that's what makes Reloaded so damn great. I think it's better than the first one, and I mean this honestly, after having slept on it for 24h.I loved the pacing. The first third or so has been called slow or pointless, but it made me admire the Wachowskis all the more - this is not average Hollywood. It's moody, dark and ominous. You need this atmospheric piece to set up the tone of Zion and the events for the rest of the movie. It's then followed by some INCREDIBLE, stylishly choreographed and shot action sequences. The last third brings Major Revelations (tm), but they're not forced or cheesy. The superlative action is surpassed only by the expansive plot.I'd say that this one messes with your mind more than the first one, and this is from someone who knows the universe of the original inside and out. But being the middle part, this doesn't need to wrap things up neatly. It gives you a glimpse of just how deep the rabbit-hole is; unlike the first one, you don't see the end of it.Though it was written in a trilogy, Matrix didn't have any guaranteed sequels, so it needed to have a sense of closure. All the loose ends were tied at the end of it, which is one of the reasons why it's a less challenging and less interesting experience than Reloaded. This one's truly a mind-f**k, and the third one will need to bring some major revelations. In many ways, this is shaping up to be the Empire Strikes Back of the Matrix trilogy.I'll see it again this weekend to absorb it some more. I'm not a huge fan of the first one, I didn't admire its pseudo-philosophizing. Yes, this has some cheesy, self-conscious dialogue, and some of the action is over-the-top by normal standards. But within this stylized world, it all fits together into an immensely satisfying experience.9/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I loved the special effects, but the most fun for me was the extremely interesting and complex dialogue between the characters.

I think Matrix Reloaded was fun and exciting entertainment. Well worth the price of admission!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first Matrix had breathtaking special effects and the story was so unique. I think this movie was great. They outdid themselves on the special effects. The story explained so much.The first thing I noticed was how powerful Neo had become. In the Matrix he had trouble battling Agents. Now he can take on 100s at a time. The fight scene was great.Originally I had thought that the Oracle was a person, but its so interesting that she is a program. That gives a whole new take on the Matrix itself and how it operates. So not every person is actually a human.I have read some comments about the Matrix being an Onion. I don't think it is. I believe that like Agent Smith, Neo has discovered a way for his powers to exist outside the Matrix. He is truly ""the One"". They have taken the ""Jesus"" idea of Neo from the first movie to an entire new level. How could ""Jesus"" be more powerful than God. Maybe Neo is the ""God"" of the Matrix? His battle against Agent Smith in the next movie will truly decide the fate of the Matrix.I also think that the Counsellor, the old fellow that met with Neo in the engineering room was the last ""the One"". I think with the help of the 24 he selected they rebuilt Zion. He was able to see past the Commander and believe in Neo. He understood the fate of Zion. He understood the reliance on machines.The Architect was really something else. It was funny he looked exactly like Sigmund Freud. He cannot be the ""God"" of the Matrix because he has proven to be infallible. Neo was not supposed to choose love. The Architect underestimated Neo's love and his powers.All very interesting.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The truth is that most of these people aren't very smart at all. Maybe this movie is 'deep and profound' for the average mainstream moviegoer, but for anyone who is even remotely into philosophy, the movie fails miserably to pretend its 'deepness'. Most of the so-called philosophic parts of the matrix are prime examples of standard 'I'm an 18 year old who thinks he's making a great discovery when saying that nothing is what it seems' philosophy. Most of the so-called deep parts of the matrix are horribly obvious for anyone with half a brain. People need to see this movie for what it really is: A stupid Sci-Fi film with a ludicrous amount of pointless special effects and fight scenes, long leather raincoats and sunglasses and the two worst parts of the whole movie: a 5-minute moronic dance scene and a totally unbelievable and ridiculously acted love story. All of this and a bit of so-called 'totally deep and profound, dude' pretentiousness makes for a success at the box office! (I'm not even mentioning the huge amount of pointless 'whoa' scenes)2/10... At least the first one had some merits and wasn't so obviously trying to draw in the dumb crowd.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Unlike the first Matrix, the storyline did stray to points unnecessary (i.e. Zion dance/sex scene), but as a whole, Matrix Reloaded was pure enjoyment, giving enough to think through and talk about for weeks.Throughout 'Reloaded' there are discoveries made and revelations found that add an entirely new level to the existence and creation and makeup of the Matrix, not to mention to the band of rebels trying to avert it.  What we thought we knew from the first film only scratches the surface as to what is exposed in Reloaded.  While 'Reloaded' was excellent, the Wachowski Brothers have crafted the Matrix films to such an epic, grand scale that I'm sure will take viewing them all in their entirety to truly appreciate what a masterpiece they have created.10/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I, for one, think differently.Actors: I have to say congratulations to Hugo Weaving and Laurence Fishburne for their performance. The others were not that great, but still managed to deliver a good performance. Scenario: Not as toughtful or complex as the first one, but MUCH better than most sci-fi movie since the original. The ending is anticlimatic and the movie is set between the Matrix and Revolutions, meaning it has no true start nor end. Even so, it's enjoyable and I can't wait for the next one. Visual effects: Come on!The philosophical aspect, altough less profound, blends well with the action scenes, which are more present than in the first one. So in a few words, it is a great movie.

Bound, the directors first movie, was a breathtaking movie with an incredible storyline.  The original Matrix managed to sustain an excellent story while boasting spectacular special effects in an awesome sci-fi thriller.  And then there were three...Without the mystery and intrigue of the original (beginning with the fanfare that asked ""what is the matrix?"") the original needed something to captivate the audience once again.  In an attempt to replicate the originals success in this area, The Matrix: Reloaded attempts to grab us with Neo's dream/prophecy of his love, Trinity, dying to an agent.  This is a decent nail-biter but nothing special, and the movie fails to gain much momentum with a total action/storyline imbalance.The action in this movie is incredible, and there's LOTS of it.  This is countered poorly with uninspired scenes outside the matrix, mainly inside a dreadfully boring Zion, the last human city.  The love scene, the dreams, the partying and the propaganda going on inside Zion feel out of place. The pacing does not build up momentum and the ups and downs of the movie are sporatic, leaving the audience with tidbits of a great scenes that feel independent and out of place.The revelation as to the reason of the one and why he exists is ingenious and one of the best scenes in the film, but without the proper building blocks prior to it leaves this crucial piece of the story alone in the dark. Trinity's rescue is almost identical to Neo's and reminds me of the second Death Star in 'Return of the Jedi'.  In the final minutes of the movie, both the unexplained and the predictable coincide to leave us with a pathetic anti-climax that feels like we've reached the middle of the movie.And, from a broader perspective, that's exactly what it is.  The final two films are, in reality, one movie cut into two, which is a shame because the storyline feels underdeveloped.  Had both been together this movie could surely have been salvaged and turned out quite well.  But as a standalone movie it leaves us with several memorable scenes as well as some incredible fighting scenes- like pieces of a puzzle not properly put into place.In the end, we can only enjoy the groundbreaking action, wonder what could have been and hope the final movie in the Matrix trilogy can salvage a potentially Indiana Jones like series.7/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As RELOADED begins, Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus arrive in Zion with new crew member Link (Harold Perrineau), and discover that 250,000 dreaded sentinels are close to launching a massive attack on the underground haven for the liberated minds of humanity. When Neo seeks advice from the prophetic Oracle (the late Gloria Foster), their meeting leads to a sorely outnumbered fight with Neo's old nemesis, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving). While the sentinels advance on Zion, various battles within the Matrix continue to escalate, culminating in an extended highway chase sequence involving Morpheus, Trinity, more imposing agents, and two new adversaries--the relentless white-clad Twins (Adrian and Neil Rayment).With RELOADED, the Wachowski brothers delve deeper into both the realm of the Matrix and the apocalyptic, machine-controlled future reality. Initially giving ample attention to both the romance between Neo and Trinity and to the vast underground city of Zion, the film eventually delivers one stunning set piece after another, with the amazing martial arts sequences and jaw-dropping effects of the first MATRIX elevated to even more astounding heights. In addition to the returning cast of Reeves, Moss, Fishburne, Weaving, and Foster, Perrineau and Jada Pinkett Smith make for welcome new additions, and Monica Bellucci offers up an unforgettably sensual appearance. Larger than the original scale on every level, THE MATRIX RELOADED is a thoroughly entertaining sequel that will leave viewers eager for the trilogy's conclusion, THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Would green light a follow-up. Enter 2003's 'The Matrix Reloaded' - one of two sequels from the franchise that would debut that year. As expected, neither of these efforts came close to matching the original.Think of 'Reloaded' as a souped up model that takes everything to the Nth degree. The oversaturation of slo-mo and special effects gives it a vibe of being a confectionary concoction that was meant to appeal to the masses in a ""cool criminal"" way. The end result is a typical Hollywood big budget blockbuster that's all style and no substance.The bond between its main stars - Reeves, Moss and Fishburne - is still there, but they almost become second fiddle to the bloated cast of characters who are added to the mix - the main standout being Monica Bellucci's Persephone (who has an unforgettable one-liner). There are also plenty of gratuitous scenes scattered throughout, particularly fighting sequences and a highway chase, that feel like they could belong in any film from this era. Perhaps the worst failing of 'Reloaded' is its unoriginality - not surprising given it's a sequel, but still not acceptable given what came to be expected from the Wachowskis.The only worse sci-fi film to be released in 2003 was 'The Matrix Revolutions,' so at least it's better than that.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I see this type of expected movies twice so I can understand it better and I always think something else in my second contemplation. In Attack ofthe Clones everytime  I saw it I noticed it sucked more and more. In Two Towers I loved it the first time... the second time I felt that the first one had that Tolkien Magic that the secon instalment didnt. In Matrix I can really see it as a whole. It beautifully connects one another, and Im not a Matrix hardcore Fan, Im more in it for the phylosophycal terms that for the special effects. The special effects is a ver important factor in the movie. Thats what the matrix is all about... and Ive heard people complaining that it wasnt as good as the other one and i dont understand. For those Fast and the Furious geeks who likes special effects will satisfy them. The plot is there very clear so i dont know why the complain of no plot ive read. The plot got more reacher now but its harder to find, and you have to dig very deep to understand it well, thats what its all about, the matrix is not easy to understand, and what the movie is about choice... you must choose in between looking at the special effects and go see the movie because all of its promotion (the matrix has you) or you can understand the movie in all its source and se the meaning of all behind it. I dare to say that is one of the best sci fi movies from hollywood out there. And its hard for me to see as a sequel, it is but i put them all together. I wasnt expecting this movie so mucho so i couldnt get my hopes high and it amazed me. That scene of the cake were the desire of men makes us weak and loose control of everything all those themes are very important and thats the true meaning of the movie... the other scene were the councilor talks to neo is very important, the architect. Howcome i dont hear people talking about this. People only talk about the bullet time.... hahaha again... the matrix has you. I recomend you to see it at least twice withot all those stupid ""fans"" screaming a cheering on the movie. So you can understand it well.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I have the videocassette of the first Matrix movie and have seen it maybe five times or so.  It's an absolutely fantastic movie, but I wouldn't consider myself to be a fanatic of the whole Matrix phenomena.  Therefore, I just couldn't get into this first sequel.  Maybe you have to be a Matrix fanatic or be more familiar with The Matrix than I was to enjoy this movie.  I just felt there were absolutely too much talk and too much philosophy mumbo-jumbo that only die-heard Matrix believers can decipher.Nevertheless, the visuals for this movie were fantastic with the Freeway scene and the Agent Smiths battle.  I believe the movie took a turn for the better when we were introduced to Monica Bellucci.  That was a sight for sore eyes!!  Other than that, there's nothing I really liked about this movie.  The scenes in Zion were absolutely ridiculous and laughable, and I got absolutely lost in the scenes with The Oracle and The Architect.

I wasn't that impressed with the first movie. I mean, our reality isn't reality; comic books having been toying with that idea for years. But I really liked Reloaded. So okay, the plot dragged a bit and it probably should've ended before it did and I haven't liked Keanu Reeves in anything since the first Bill and Ted movie (I was, like, 8; sue me), but the awesome action scenes (especially the freeway chase) more than made up for that. I definitely could've done without that ridiculous Powerade commercial in the beginning (good drink, though).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I didn't adore it; I didn't go nuts about it. Thinking about it now, I wonder why. Maybe I was a different person at that time. For, today when I saw The Matrix Reloaded, I absolutely loved it from the first sight.I'm a woman and I've heard such nonsense as `women usually don't like Matrix'. My response to it would be as Virgin Mary put it: `Come again?' Because that's the most insane thing I've ever heard.Still, about the film - some people are just able to produce a film that simply blows your mind. Wachowski brothers are geniuses, no doubt about it. It pisses the hell out of me when I read reviews, which criticize the abundance of philosophy and the scarcity of action scenes. Where the heck do they come up with these things? In my eyes, The Matrix Reloaded is more than anything I've ever seen before. Every other film seems like a mote compared to this masterpiece.I especially enjoyed Neo's conversation with the Architect. What a marvellous language, so splendid and distinguished - makes you realise the richness of English. Being a non-native speaker, these kinds of things are a motivation to learn more and more about English language.Needless to comment upon the action scenes - Neo fighting hundreds of Smiths and the highway occurrence, etc - they were spectacular. Every human being with an ability to see understands it.I'm usually not a film-person. I mean, I watch them but I never get carried away by them. This one did it to me. ERGO - must be something so perfect. And it is!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first Matrix had an elegance in its editing, sound, production, color scheme, and story. It was so elegant in fact I can't stand to watch it many times over because the package is too tight.Now the second Matrix. As other reviewers have pointed out, the beginning of the film isn't editted well, it doesn't have enough interesting parts. And the beginning sequence with trinity is out of place as well. It seems that the brothers and studio have fallen in love with themselves, they think they can put anything out there and without polishing it everyone will love it.The film does get better as it goes along however. An idea that sounded good on paper, Neo fighting many copies of Agent Smith didn't turn out to be that thrilling. But at least it is some action.Some concepts do turn out well, like the two albinos and the car chase scene. Although people have put down the superman scenes, I like them. The set design, except for the Zion rave is extremely consistant and elegant, continuing the tradition set by the first movie.I like the relationships in this movie, I didn't find them contrived. It is strange how characters in the Matrix all fall into a few categories. There is the mystic who says important stuff very quickly and cryptically. There is the action hero who doesn't say anything but does cool stuff and looks good. And there are a few support characters who are mostly standard movie cliches.Many people don't have time for the philosophy of this movie. It isnt' very well explained, it's a lot deeper and less solid. Most people aren't willing to figure out the reasons behind things that seem stupid, for example why does a guard fight neo when he is on neo's side? Well the guard says that he fights neo to know him, but it isn't very slickly presented so it makes the scene nonsensical at first glance.Even with its flaws, it is a good movie. Even with certain effects lacking, it advances effects forward. The acting is no worse than the first, and the characters who are supposed to give speeches give them well, and the main characters who are just supposed to do stunts do them well. The music and sound is unfortunately worse than the first one, but I think it's a product of the times, in 1999 techno was really being innovative and fresh and interesting and now it isn't as much.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Its really more like the first half of a 5 hour movie(completed in Revolutions), so some story stuff is introduced that has yet to be fleshed out.  The effects are extraordinary, but unfortunately I can still tell when they go to CGI in the fights, and it bothers me.  Its less bothersome here, since the worl do the Matrix is computer generated, so its sorta ok to have CGI fighters, unlike in Blade 2.  Problem is, I want to see real people duking it out, not pixels.  Martial arts are about what the human body can achieve, not what John Gaeta can do with his computer.  And I miss bullet-time.  Virtual cinematography just isnt the same.  Bullet time had real cameras moving through real space, virtual cinematography is fake.  But still...the movie rocked, i want to see it again already, and I just saw it last night.  The burly brawl(Neo vs a hundred Smiths) was awesome, despite the CGI, and I cant wait til Revolutions.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

While Reloaded isn't utterly terrible, it's by far the worst of the series.The plot is Reloaded's strongest point. It would be rather pathetic for the movie to have a bad plot, after all; it's simply picking up where the Matrix left off, and it's rather difficult to mutilate the storyline of the original movie THAT badly. Without giving away too many spoilers, let's just say that there are enough plot twists to keep you guessing, not an overload to simply annoy you, and the very end has a couple nice ones which will make you want to see Revolutions.The original Matrix movie wasn't just about action, although that was a major part of it. There was an almost philosophical touch to it all, especially with the dialog of Fishburne's character, Morpheus. While Reloaded has a bit of that, it makes certain that you realize this movie is 99% about the action. And that's a problem, because the action in this one is not up to par. Oh, the choreography is great and all, but fights get rather repetitive when, for example, literally about 40% of the fight between Morpheus and the Agent is slow motion. Neo versus Agent Smith(s) is repetitive as well, and most annoying is the slow motion once more for one simple reason: Neo and the Agents are CGI in many scenes, which would go unnoticed if they didn't show it in slow motion and zoom in on their plastic-toy-like faces! Basically, technology gets in the way of what could otherwise be decent action.Acting in Reloaded, while not quite as good as the original in a way that is difficult to explain, is still quite satisfactory. Dialogue is good as usual. These and the plot would all bring up the movie's grade enough to counteract the low ""Action"" score if Reloaded could put less emphasis on action. Granted, its plot makes that more difficult; the original Matrix had much more time in the real world despite never visiting Xion, while Reloaded takes place almost entirely in the Matrix, where the action is. Nonetheless, unless you don't mind a barrage of annoying special effects, it simply distracts too much from the better parts of the movie. A good movie, but a bad Matrix movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Dispel the magic. Some movies work best on mystery. Some work well by exposing all the components. Like with, say Star Wars, the film works better when you don't have all the details but you are thrown in and then out media res. You come in the middle, you leave as fast and without firm resolution. Do we need all explained and to know all that happens after (or in Star Wars case, before)? Do we need to know the function of the Matrix so intimately? Do we need to know the nature of the Oracle? Do we need to see Zion or does it work best as an almost mythological refuge of man, left to our own imagination.2. Does the duration hamper the impact of the film? This film is a schism between waxing low level philosophy and extreme visual effects. Both have their merits when woven well - the first film managed this. Reloaded seems to crave them into the story in long chunks. Too long scenes of action, too long, droning scenes of dialogue. This film would work far better with a more dynamic edit. There are scenes which are overlong, scenes which are superfluous. Overall, these scenes damage the good ones.Aside from that, Neo remains unlikeable and thus is love relationship uninspired. Mr Smith is great and some of the dialogue manages to surface above the general trite philosophy.Watch it if you REALLY want to see the end story of the tale of Mr Anderson. Beware, it's a hard slog, and when you commit to this film, you commit to the next... it's the nature of things Mr Anderson.. better off enjoying ""The Matrix"" and then watching something else.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I liked the movie, although there is something missing in this one. ""Reloaded"" clarifies The Matrix, and then goes down the path of layered cyber-reality coupled with both Bibical and Buddhist references. What is the Oracle? And who is the Architect of the Matrix? Is Neo really the One? The acting is uneven. And is this surprising given the quality of the first movie. Lawrence Fishburne really chews up the scenery in a couple scenes as Morpheus. Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss fare much better by underplaying their roles. My friend, Carrie-Anne, is very good-- I thought. Then again I am biased in this. As Trinity, Carrie-Anne is strong, sexy, and vulnerable. Keanu returning as Neo is efficient, and perhaps a little too stoic for the evolving role of the chosen One. The visuals in Reloaded are absolutely stunning-- the highway sequence is totally amazing. The fighting sequences are excellent. The one thing that was missing for me, was an emotional investment and payoff. Reloaded is high on cool, and very Zen-ed out. At times it is like (really when you think about it) The Wizard of Oz jacked on steroids and coke. However, Reloaded lacks some of the charm and humanity of The Matrix. This may be one of the dangers or pitfalls of catching a Messiah tale in Act 2. ""Reloaded"" is also a bit significant about itself. What made The Matrix great, is that it was a cool action movie with a rather novel concept. People just read significance into it. At times ""Reloaded"" is a convoluted philosophical sledgehammer. Anyway, I may be too far down the rabbit hole on this one...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Some are horrible. Others outshine their predecessors. And now we have a sequel to the beloved Matrix, four-years in the making. And like Star Wars Episode 5 or Blade II, this sequel blows the original apart. Why? The visuals are more stunning, but that is hardly the important factor. The story here, although simple, is twice that of the original. The first Matrix was beautifully crafted to shock and surprise the audience with this image of fabricated reality. There is no way the sequel will copy that same format, considering that we already know what we are supposed to know about the system and the prophecy of the one. But The Matrix was not original in its most basic story. It follows in the same tradidition as the original Star Wars trilogy: a man who is ignorant of the world around him steps into his role as the savior of mankind. The Matrix is like that. However, Reloaded provides us with only remnants of that first storyline. Now it is a discovery of the ""why"" question rather than the ""how"". There is a dumbfounding twist at the end (which I will not reveal here. See the movie!) which adds an entirely new dimension to the story. There are also some strong Classical themes here regarding leadership, themes which are brought up with the same questions of choice in Vergil's Aeneid. Reloaded may initially seem like nothing more than an action movie with some philosophy as a bonus. But to those who listen carefully and comprehend what it is they are saying, Reloaded is an incredible experience. Though of course you may have to see it twice to fully grasp what the Wachowski's are trying to accomplish. But, why wouldn't you see it twice? It is just that awesome.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was alright. The problems are 3-fold. * Every scene is about twice as long as it needs to be. Every fight scene, every chase scene, every dialogue scene. They just dragged on and on to the point where you're actually wishing a previously cool scene would just end already. Which probably has much to do with..* The filmmakers take themselves way too seriously. Everything was done for the sake of itself. Fight scenes because a fight scene would be cool here. A love story because they think they should have one. Philosophical babble because it'll make them sound deep. I think they bought into the rantings of the ""Philosophy of the Matrix"" books and such that tried to read into it as more than just entertainment inspired by various influences (pop culture, religious, and otherwise). They're trying to be so deep, to create a mythology, but come off as just posturing and rambling. * The effects. Sure the fight scenes and all the FX in the movie are cool, but they were just given too much money this time. There was a seemingly endless, pointless scene of watching a ship come in and dock. I swear it had to be ten minutes. They also relied on CGI when the scenes were looking just fine with practical effects. It's jolting when you can notice the exact moment whenever it converts to a CG shot. Part of the dissatisfaction with the movie may be the lack of resolution. As the middle chapter of the story, it obviously has loose ends, right down to the quite generic cliffhanger-style ending (bum-bum-BUMMMMMMM!!!). But while I enjoyed parts of it, it will be a much better film when I can watch it with a fast-forward button.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Normally we groan with mortification upon hearing a sequel being made to one of our favorite movies.  Such was not the case for Matrix Reloaded.  Now, I still thoroughly enjoy the original and hold it above Reloaded, but in no way does Reloaded fall short of the mark.The special effects are just as spectacular, the acting even better (with me growing to appreciate Keanu's talent more and more), and the cinematography incredible.  The set design for Zion was just absolutely fabulous.  I've read some weren't impressed with the storyline.  I, however, found it intriguing and in keeping with the Matrix theme. To me, anything else simply would have been a cop-out and not held up to the ""feel"" of the movie in and of itself.  I won't say more for fear of spoiling it for anyone.Now, I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed with certain scenes.  The CG was just entirely TOO obvious and, at times, looked like the animatrix rather than the Matrix.  Had I been watching an animated version, I'd have been impressed, but since this was supposed to be ""real people"", it only detracted from the experience for me...but not much.  Furthermore, some of the fight scenes WERE a bit overdone; but at the same time, I would have been seriously disappointed had Neo wiped out Smith in a kick or two.  So, again, this didn't detract much from the overall experience.  However, one aspect of the movie DID grate on my nerves...the unnecessary fight scenes thrown in just to...well, have a fight scene.  This definitely got old after a while.Aside from some of the minor flaws, Reloaded was incredibly entertaining. With humor, action, good acting, wonderful scenery, and awesome special effects, Reloaded proved it can hold up to its predecessor.  It's difficult going into a movie where you KNOW there's going to be a third one and you know who will be IN the third one...leaves little room for surprises.  Well, so you would think.  Reloaded was able to look beyond its upcoming sequel and pull you into the here and now; surprising you with its little twists and turns.Overall, this movie was just fantastic and a must see for Matrix fans, or even fans of action in general, and definitely will be one of the biggest blockbusters of the year (apart from Revolutions that is).  Out of 10 stars, I give Reloaded a 9...only taking a point away for the slight ""problems"" I had with the film.  This is truly a must see!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There is a very long dance scene early in the movie that adds nothing to further the plot.  Also toward the end Neo is presented with an explanation of event that is slightly hard to follow.

After the end of the first Matrix i was thinking how cool it would be to see Neo kick ass now that he discovered his powers.  well he did lots of that in this second installment.  There was lots of explanations and discussions about the Matrix, which could make this movie seem a bit dragged out for those of you out there that don't like to use your brain.  but overall i think the writers did a good job of explaining everything and making a logical plot.  Of course there are still many unresolved issues at the end of this movie (unlike the sort of triumphant feeling you get after seeing the first one), but that is to be expected in the second installment of a trilogy. The special effects/fight scenes were stunning.  and they didn't just have one or two cool sequences.  instead there were TONS of really intricate, complicated, mindblowing scenes which must have took tons of time and effort and money to create. If you haven't seen it yet, don't even bother to read all the mixed opinions... i've heard both ends of the spectrum.  i don't know why the hell anyone could possibly bash this movie.  if you don't like it, then just don't watch it again.  it certainly doesn't deserve a 1 rating!screw everyone who bashes this movie for no good reason.  go watch The Matrix Reloaded and decide for yourself. can't wait for Revolutions in Nov!!! :-D","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And why not treat yourself with a Matrix frenzy -- watching all three in one go?...","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It might have been best if the Wachowski brothers had chosen to let the original stand and live on in the minds of fans around the world.There's not a lot in Reloaded in the way of plot -- just two hours of kung fu and car chases and flying and shooting and, oh yeah, did I mention flying? Characters go and do things, not because they think it's best, but because they're told to. When the characters question why, these inquiries are deflected with a wink and a ""just do it. You'll see."" You get the feeling that this is the message for the movie-goer too: ""Shhh. Don't think about it. Look: Trinity is wearing leather pants. And here's some kung fu.""That being said, the Matrix Reloaded is a fantastic piece of special effects and action wizardry. It's beautiful and deadly and so slick it threatens to slide right off the screen. Everyone should see it. It's fun, full stop.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

We've got a case of 'Jaws 2' here...From the 'Caligula' scene to the 'Frenchman' scene, where you actually see code travelling up a woman's skirt and causing a pseudo-orgasm (a Matrix super-fan's fantasy, I suppose), this movie is too much sizzle with no steak.If you do see it, play this fun game-- actually try to listen to any of the dialogue from either the French guy or 'The Architect' and see how the sentences don't make sense by themselves much less together. It seems like two C- scoring Philosophy 101 essays, one on causality and the other on free will/determinism, were plagiarized at random for most of this dialogue. Painful.Even the effects don't pack the punch they should, and the one really visually impressive scene (the playground duel with many 'Smith's' vs. Neo) is undermined by a terrible musical score (so is the rest of the movie).","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Being an avid Matrix / Sci-fi fan I was very psyched about the film, but I had heard a few negative reviews and that had put me in an apprehensive mood (some reviews said it was like Star Wars Episode 2...too wordy and convoluted with an almost religious fervor).  But the opening sequence glued me to my seat.Now shortly after an opening fight sequence, the exposition started and we get caught up on what went on since the events in the Matrx.  I really loved the political conflicts that went on here, you get a sense that not everyone is on board with the whole idea of Neo being the ""One"".  These sequences are helped along by the cast doing a great job of acting (not just fighting). Reloaded does a great job at juxtaposing the bright world of the Matrix with that of the grey Zion.  You also get the sense that in the Matrix, our heros kick butt, but outside of the Matrix they are very vulnerable.  As for the fight scenes in the movie....WOW.  Some of the best action sequences I have ever seen.  Simply jaw dropping.  From the characters using almost every weapon to their gravity defying kung-fu fighting, these scenes can best be described as intense. One thing I would have liked to have more of though was the music.  Some scenes you had to strain to hear the music over the sound effects...but this could have been the theater I was at.Overall I would say Reloaded out does the first movie in everyway.  The action sequences are better, the story is more indepth and there is a greater sense of urgency.  Although not as ground breaking as the first, think of it as an ""upgrade"".My rating 10/10. (If you like the Matrix, check out Dark City and Ghost in the Shell, both great movies which more than likely had an impact on the creators of the Matrix movies.)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

About my only criticism is that, while the special effects are uncanny, a scene or two begins to look more like a cartoon than real life.

Let me put that in front of everything. I have read some other comments on the movie by other people and they all seem a little dissapointed because they compare the film to the first one. I believe they're all wrong. The Matrix 1 was a fantastic film in it's own way. The basic storyline invlolved little more then the transformation of Neo from computer hacker to the possible saviour of mankind. Reloaded HOWEVER is in all ways very different. It's almost impossible to compare Reloaded to Matrix 1. Reloaded works on so much more levels than the original, the relationship of neo and trinity becomes more apparent, the architect (which is a brilliant scene) explains the earlier versions of the matrix and more and the most important aspect: Zion. The main reason that Morpheus fights as passionately as he does.For me the idea of the matrix fascinated me ever since 1999 and now, after seeing Reloaded, i am once again in complete and utter awe of the wachowski brothers. These guys are brilliant and deliver what is expected of them. Reloaded has it all, the BEST action in a movie ever combined with one of the most ingenious and creative storylines in history.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Upon watching such films, one has to attempt to categorize this complete tale that has plagued our minds with perfection for so many countless hours in front of the screen. The matrix has set the ground rules for near perfect science fiction films, and action suspense. Its follow up has more to offer than it's 4-year-old tale of awakening and truth. Reloaded continues the story of the war against artificial intelligence by giving the audience more of what was once seen before. We are witnessing more fights, more intense action and more amazing special effects, with a mighty kick to boost us up beyond comprehension to a whole new other level of filmmaking. The film adds a deeper story to Neo's ability and everyone's purpose in the story of it all. But witnessing such a successful sequel, I couldn't help but notice the endless opportunities the franchise has. The story is deeper, and more sophisticated with endless tones of enjoyment. The story is really moving ahead by really spicing everything we've seen to a whole new product. For people who were satisfied by the effect `The Matrix' gave them back in 1999, and for those yet to experience it, `Reloaded' is the story that was simply waiting to be told in it's purest form 4 years ago. I think it has to be acknowledged that the first part was simply an introduction to the characters with a touch of the real story getting underway. Like the Starwars franchise, these films are better appreciated when one views them as the complete story they are and not the separate chapters sequels label them to be. If you saw `The Matrix' then don't stop at the beginning, push through till the end and then label the story by preference. `Reloaded' is cracking stuff with a cliffhanger to make you go wild, it's still your Hollywood film that boasts as one hell of a good follow up, but it's one of the only films that allows the audience today to choose how much you get involved with the story, and which area you decide to focus on.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Matrix:Reloaded is heavy-duty stuff.  The Action Sequences alone are worth the price of admission, but the story makes it so much better and so much more interesting.  The Matrix:Reloaded has the best action sequences of any movie I have ever seen! The Special Effects have evolved into near-perfection from The original Matrix. The story is much more interesting, although you need a dictionary when the architect speaks, there are some really interesting charcters that are introduced and Neo is as cool as ever. The Freeway action sequence is the best in a movie EVER as well as the ATTACK OF THE CLONES sequence which pitts Agent Smith and his clone army agianst Neo is amazing. The story is so complex but interesting that it might make some ppl confused, But I understood it fairly well. As you see this movie you begin to wonder about Fate, Love, Destiny, Life, and Human Nature in General which seem to be the deep themes for this movie. All I can say is wow! The French guy introduces a new homorous villain, Agent Smith is now a rogue and The Agents are still there as well as the Ghost Brothers! All I can say is this is a movie that has to be seen to belived! GO SEE IT NOW! Even if the story doesnt make sense to you, Tha action sequences are the best, the apex of modern filmmaking! SEE IT!

"10","/10","Don't be fooled by the criticism","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704506/?ref_=tt_urv","fellicity","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1654198/?ref_=tt_urv","25 May 2003","""...you have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inert, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it. If you are not one of us, you are one of them.""-Morpheus, 'The Matrix'The negative feedback I've seen regarding 'Matrix Reloaded' by professional (ha HA!) and amateur critics alike is quite humorous, namely because it reeks of the current affinity for anti-intellectualism in all things, including film...""There's too much talking""""All that philosophy is boring""""The story doesn't go anywhere""""It wasn't as good as the first one""Blah, blah, blah.  Those who dislike 'Matrix Reloaded' seem to do so because the pauses between fight scenes are longer than in the first Matrix installment.  Pretty sad when you think about it.The fact of the matter is that the Wachowski brothers have succeeded where so many other filmmakers have failed.  They have created a sequel that doesn't attempt to ""outdo"" its predecessor, substituting plot and artistic vision with newer and fancier special effects (*cough* Lucas), but that perfectly builds upon the story laid out in 'The Matrix' while leading us into the culmination of 'Revolutions'.  That 'Reloaded' is more than a visually stunning fight-fest was undoubtedly a source of disappointment for those used to plunking down ten bucks and going switch-off in their theatre seats.  That this film was more than mere surface shine and kung-fu fighting proves to me 'The Matrix' wasn't a fluke and the Wachowski brothers are as brilliantly auteur as they originally appeared.  These are truly revolutionary films.Addressing individual gripes about 'Reloaded' is tiresome, especially when such criticism involves the amount of ""talking"" and ""philosophy"" found in this film... whatever that means.  No doubt these are the same people who will whinge about the length of this review.  I suppose that some people are just not going to get it, even when the storyline involves the age old Messiah theme found in everything from 'Metropolis' to 'Dune' and 'Star Wars'.  Almost excusable are those who fail to pick up on the deep mythological and theological themes prevalent in the 'Matrix' films:  Neo (""new"") led by Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams, to save the last human city on Earth, Zion, named for that city fabled to be the location of Jesus Christ's final victory.  That Morpheus commandeers the 'Nebuchadnezzar', named for the Babylonian king who brought about the fall of the Biblical Zion, is ironic.  As is the character Persephone, the mythical wife of the Greek god Hades, wedded in this film to the Merovingian, named for a race of French kings said to be direct descendants of Jesus Christ.  Throw in equally mythic characters like Niobe and Trinity, Buddhist teachings and computer tech metaphor and I can see how this story is quite a chew for the unwashed masses.  Even more complex is the theme of Objectivism and the philosophies dealing with free-will, choice and predestination.  I won't even begin to get into the various Lewis Carroll allegories.Is it helpful to know some of what I just talked about in order to ""get"" this installment of 'The Matrix'?  Probably.  But it's funny how those who fail to understand the convolutions seem to be the ones yelling the loudest about how this film has ""No plotline"" and that its story ""Goes nowhere"". This film couldn't have more of a plot without choking on it.  Besides, I know plenty of folks who don't know Demeter or Descartes from Vin Diesel and they still managed to follow and enjoy 'Reloaded'.Less excusable is the most annoying complaint of all:  that 'Reloaded' wasn't ""As good"" as 'The Matrix'.  It REALLY makes me wonder what these people found so entertaining about the first film that made them want to see the second.  Was it the flashy special effects, invented specifically for these films?  The skin-tight suits?  The pumpin' soundtrack?  The non-stop butt kicking?  Don't we get all of that and more in 'Reloaded'?  Yes, yes we do.  Trying to understand how someone could love 'The Matrix' yet be disappointed by 'Reloaded' simply leaves me shaking my head.  Maybe these people would have been happier to see another film about Morpheus training Neo to be ""The One"" rather than him actually acting upon that knowledge. Or two hours of plotless fight footage, perhaps.'The Matrix' was groundbreaking and could not have possibly been outdone, and I am so pleased that the Wachowski brothers realized this going into the remainder of the series.  Too bad so many would-be critics don't have the same good sense.So is this film as ""Horrible"" and ""Disappointing"" as those poor, clueless people would lead you to believe?  HARDLY.  'Matrix Reloaded' is, like 'The Matrix', a wonderful nexus between art and mainstream filmmaking, between technophobia both real and imagined, between Objectivism, Materialism and the fate of our own society if we continue to allow ourselves to be controlled.  It addresses many of the questions left unanswered in the first film while leaving a ton more to be tied up in the last.  It is as visually stunning as 'The Matrix' with action scenes beyond description.  The only complaint I can even think up is that a little more real human emotion could have seeped into the Too-Cool-For-School attitude these films have turned into a trademark.  A small gripe considering this is possibly one of only three sequels I can remember that has actually lived up to the high standards of its predecessor (not to mention a cliffhanger ending that rivals one of those sequels, 'The Empire Strikes Back').  Otherwise, the Wachowski brothers' only failing was in assuming that the typical movie-goer enjoys the occasional mental stimulation.Ignore the negative hype and watch for yourself.  If you enjoy being challenged intellectually as well as visually, you are sure to agree that 'Matrix Reloaded' is a welcome addition to what is shaping up to be a remarkable film series.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It had all the things I like in a Action movie. It had new charactors, new action, and new fight moves. And, it had new visual effects...that I found AMAZING! The Wachouskies are doing new things...taking movie making to a whole new level.Plot: In this movie...the machines are stomping on the last human city (Zion). Neo has come into his full powers. The individual has left his room. Smith is expanding...he is able to copy himself...he is no longer an Agent. And, for Neo to find out new things about his past and the future. And why he has dreams of Trinity dying.There are new badguys. The Twins:...They are albino, wearing all white. They have the ability to ""PHASE"", in witch so...they turn into ""ghost"" like things, and in turning into these ""GHOSTS"" they have the ability to go through ANYTHING.The Marovigian: He has control of ""things"". The Twins work for him. He also has his goons/guards around him all the time. They fight almost as good as Neo does. His wife ""Persephony"" knows that he is cheating on her. He LOVES the french. Expecially to curse with.The Marovingians goons: Most of them are dressed in black. One of them is dressed in white. They fight as good as Neo does. The have ""ABILLITIES""Agents: The Agents are back...the are ""upgraded"". They fight almost as fast as Neo does. They still are...the same Agents that we saw in the last movie.Smith: He is no longer a part of the program. He is now a virus. He turns people into him. Even Agents. He is very good at fighting. He is back with a vengence. He wants Neo and Zion...dead!Good guys.Keymaker: He makes keys...and wants to help the rebels.Sereph: He protects the oricle. He is dressed in mainly...white.Persephoney is good. The cast in the first movie is back. And a few other faces. Like Niobie. She is played by Jada-Pinket-Smith. The good guys are mostly the people we saw in the first film. Even the OricleThe fights are good too. There is one against three Agents at one time (Neo). There is a SUPER FIGHT with Neo and Smiths. Neo takes a pole and whups them hard. There is one with Neo against The Marovingians goons (my fav). There is a car chase. Like no other you have ever seen! Huge explosion.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie is much deeper and more thought provoking. The Matrix told a story and handed it to you in a neatly wrapped package. Reloaded goes much deeper down the Rabbit Hole.Some have complained about lack of plot in Reloaded. Those few I've spoken to that didn't like it just plain didn't get it. This movie is MUCH more sophisticated than the first, and has taken that neatly wrapped package, opened it up, and explored its contents thoroughly. And what is found is not what is expected, and even more importantly not resolved.Perfect middle episode of a triligy.Put on your thinking caps, and enjoy another wonderful ride down the Rabbit Hole.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Reloaded is incredibly well done and about something that causes one to question and ponder life itself.  In an era of instant gratification, it seems few can find enjoyment in anything, much less a work of years in the making.  I believe the directing and production on this film to be ground breaking, the vision of a scope not seen in a film of this kind, and the experience of seeing this film affirming to the human element.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This one has some of the best affects you want in a great Sci-Fi film with a strong plot.  The fight scene between Neo and the many Smiths is excellent and the highway scene is awesome!  However, I caution there are some parts of the film that can be very difficult to follow.  There is a lot of ""double talk"" in this one and you will have to pay close attention at times.  There also a few slow periods in the beginning.  Most of this time this is due to the director setting things up but in this case, some of it just seems to be a waste of time.  However, this is made up for later in the movie. 
Over all, rather good (8 out of 10)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Like Persephone (Monica Bellucci), The Key Maker (Randall Duk Kim), Link (Harry J. Lennix), Niobe & Ghost (Jada Pinkett-Smith & Anthony Wong) and last but not least, the Marovingian (Lambert Wilson). Also I expected more from the Twins. The 'rave in Zion', I think was pretty cool. Very stylish. The action is real cool, the movie is good. But I think there should have been more plot.

Regardless, the action scenes were incredible, especially the highway scene with the twins who happened to be great villains. Hopefully they make a comeback in the next Matrix movie.

I was wrong.  The assembly of the movie is nothing like the first Matrix.  Although it is pretty much linear, there are a lot of flashbacks/flash forwards that make it a little more interesting.The ""Burly Brawl"" scene was just amazing.  Especially when you realize that the action sequences are entirely computer generated.  This is the first movie that I have seen computer graphics that did not look like it was computer generated.  A lot of that goes to the technique they used to create the scene, but still amazing nonetheless.As for the rest of the plot, I'm not telling, and hopefully no one else will.  The surprises are what made this both amazing and hilarious.  Even though there was a lot of talk about it being too romantic, that is not true.  Although there were a lot more intimate encounters with Trinity and Neo, and it plays a role in the plot, it does not overburden the movie. There is a couple more fight scenes in this one compared to the first, and they are longer.The Matrix, Reloaded does not revolve around Neo as much as it did in the first one.  This is intentional.  The Matrix was about Neo and his realization about what the matrix is and that he is the one.  Reloaded is concentrated more on the war and the danger it poses on Zion.  It also concentrates on the matrix system a little more as well.  I can't exactly say how it does, since that will give some of the plot away.In conclusion, if you saw The Matrix, then you should go see The Matrix, Reloaded.  9 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"10","/10","I took the red pill...again.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704313/?ref_=tt_urv","TheBabblingFool","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1206572/?ref_=tt_urv","26 May 2003","I am a huge fan of The Matrix; I like it more than any other film franchise, more than Star Wars, more than Lord of the Rings, more than the rest of them. The Matrix Reloaded was a film that I had anxiously been waiting for over a very long time. I knew of the sequels the first time I saw The Matrix, but my waiting went into hyper-drive when I saw the first teaser for the sequels one year ago before Attack of the Clones. For one year, I waited anxiously and it was all worth it. I find it funny that two weeks before Reloaded came out that there was X2, a movie that takes the world its predecessor (X-men) started and expands it, opens it up, and plays around with it. This is essentially what Reloaded does, it takes the world that The Matrix teased us and introduced us with and adds more characters, more options, more action and more mystery, after answering questions I had about the first one, and of course, more cool sunglasses.My experience with watching Reloaded the first time was the same as seeing The Matrix the first time. They have the essentially the same flow. They both start out with Trinity beating up cops and end with Rage Against the Machine. They both have first halves that focus more on plot and second halves that end with a lot of action.The action is pumped up from the first. The Matrix had well choreographed fights that were pretty one sided, consisting of mostly either Neo or Morpheus getting trampled by an Agent. Here Neo is up to par with the cyber thugs he encounters, so the fights can go either way, making them more amusing and more enjoyable. I watch a lot of Kung Fu films, I am a Jackie Chan and Jet Li junkie, and I do have to say that the fights in this film are some of, if not the best group fights ever choreographed. People punch, kick, flip and fight with a level of fluid poetry that amazes me.I was also dumbfounded by the car chase sequence. Much like the lobby shootout in its predecessor Reloaded takes something we take for granted in a movie, in this case a car chase, and just makes it look jaw droppingly good. Every crash, every swerve it was like the idea that cars colliding together in a destructive manner was ever possible, or entertaining, had never crossed my mind. I was practically applauding during the fight between Morpheus and the Agent on the back of the semiI've dreamed of seeing two people fight on the back of a semi for years.As for the special effects, some of the time they are noticeable. In the fight between Neo and Agent Smith you can notice that for a few of the stunts, it's not Keanu Reeves but a CGI rendering. I frankly don't care, I would rather have a CGI Keanu perform some of those stunts rather than see the real Keanu attempt it and break his neck. Overall it doesn't matter to me whether or not they use special effects because Neo, whether CGI or not, swatting around Agent Smiths like baseballs, is just pure fun to the Nth degree.All of the lovable characters are back, Neo is still the unsure antagonist, Trinity is still the butt kicking babe, and Morpheus is back as the calm wise leader that he has always been, and Agent Smith is back and better than ever as the lovable villain that he is. New lovable characters are introduced like Merovingian and his wife Persephone, and their two body guards, The Twins, that have the ability to walk through walls. All of these characters are slightly over the top, making the deep insides of the matrix seem like a twisted Alice in Wonderland type of place.My only problem with the film is that the supporting human cast aren't as interesting. The character of Link was obviously written for the part of Tank  (who was excluded from the sequels due to the actor who played him being a pain in the butt, supposedly) and the kid who follows Neo around (I don't believe his name was mentioned) reminds me too much of Mouse from the first film.The plot is the key to the movie, it's intelligent, and it takes precedence over the action. If you sit in the theater with your brain tuned to the action sequences, then you won't understand the plot, because it isn't dumbed down (it took me a 2nd viewing to get it down completely). It has a cliffhanger ending that you had to pay attention to the plot fully to get. That is what I love about Reloaded most of all, that it feels like the film that the directors wanted to make, rather than some studio-run explosion fest made for cash purposes only. Essentially this film is like art, you're either going to like it or hate it, regardless of your initial feelings about the first film.Overall The Matrix Reloaded is a film that has mind boggling action scenes inside a plot that is as deep and meaningful as you want to take it. I have seen many themes from many areas of human thought, too much to list. This is the reason that I love The Matrix series so much, is that there are themes and meanings galore to entertain yourself, letting you choose how deep within the rabbit hole you want to go.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There are some scenes here that could have easily been dropped on the cutting floor without affecting quality or the story line.  The rest of the film is just one wild ride after another with Kung Fu, an AMAZING car chase, and special effects.  I have to say that while the special effects were hardly revolutionary they have been polished to near perfection.The worst part about this film is the ending.  It leaves so many plot lines hanging that I just can't wait to see where we will be taken in Matrix Revolutions........David","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"3","/10","It cost $300 million to make and they forgot to get a script with a plot. A triumph for childish posing and advertising.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704597/?ref_=tt_urv","egglestc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2412379/?ref_=tt_urv","27 May 2003","Don't try to intellectualise this film its meant to be entertainment. If you know anything about Buddhism, you will laugh at the mock attempts to add a spiritual element. If you know anything about Kung fu you will be amazed at the lack of realistic fight scenes. If you know anything about Motor bikes you'll be amazed to see a Duccati  road bike survive a 12 foot drop without its suspension giving way. At the end of the first Matrix we see Neo go into Agent Smith while in the Matrix and destroy him, yet we are supposed to be amazed when he is able to go inside Trinity and extract a Bullet and then start her heart. If Neo can stop a hail of bullets he should be able to stop anything so why does he get involved in fist fights? If the agents are so deadly in the first film how come the upgades dont seem to ingender any fear anymore? If Zion (please! i can hardly hold back the laughter) is hundreds of miles into the earth then the temperature would be at least 1000c. The part of the mantle near the crust, about 50-100 km down, is especially soft and plastic not at all a good place to build your refuge! At no point does the film carry you away, in places it utterly hammy. Sentimental scenes and slow moving and utterly predictable plot leave you wondering where all the money went. Certainly not where it was needed. And then comes the only thing that the film is sold on , the stunts. These looked spectacular but didn't have any purpose other than it was 'about time' for another fight. Let me put it another way, every fight scene is long but ultimately is limited by unimaginative special effects and repetitive action sequences. People will soon realise its more spectacular to see real humans doing these stunts than rely on mish mash dominated by computer graphics. The Matrix uses very good effects, I'm sure, but it still doesn't have the same impact as long fight scenes in for example crouching tiger,many Jackie Chan films or the inventiveness of some of the computer generated fight scenes in a contemporary film such as The One. Not that the later is a great example of film making. I'm sure people can name others. In the scene where Neo fights hundreds of Agents it is clearly obvious the figures are computer generated, the faces are rendered but lack any real human texture, you may say this is nit picking but when you read a review quoting the The Wachowski Brothers that says  ` no will ever be able to do these effect again' you are  forced to think constantly while watching the film I think someone will definatly do better  and people may already have exceeded this. In spite of all the fighting I think we see Neo kills one person, Neo has become the fifth member of the A-Team and the film is obviously aimed at a similar market that the A-Team appealed to, young boys/men (remember there were many years when the A-Team was considered Cool). Neo fly's like superman and we are suposed to go 'oooo' that's new! and they mention it 'Hes doing his superman thing' so hey there self mocking, how clever of them!. Just for comparison Superman was made in 1978 at a cost of $55 million and contains almost identical flying stunts just a little rougher around the edges. $55 Million was a lot back then and $300 million is a lot right now, you'd expect more from a film in both cases.Within the first 5 minutes an agent says  'Its happening again only different this time'. So we are told that we can expect to see the beginning at the end, this looping trick is as old as the hills, most films try not to give it away though. The Wachowski Brothers obviously think there audience isn't listening or is rather stupid, Maybe? What is the point of the Key man? thats right none. To make things worse they even manage to get a car chase into the film! With some stunts that reminded me of Smokey and the Bandit!!! In spite of the hype its nothing new. Interesting at best. I suggest you watch as many of the trailers as you can and you will have seen the best bits and wont have to bother with wasting your money and time at the cinema. I would say its probably quite good for a younger audience who are easily impressed, but such a shallow film will leave most adults saying they have seen it all before. Of course if you like the idea of a really long advert for Black Leather coats and sunglasses with the occasional acrobatic punch up then go.  But don't try to tell me about the hidden mystical meanings. Read the books The Iliad , The Odyssey, (Persephone is captured by Hades, When she is with Hades in the underworld we get Autumn/Winter on earth, when with her mother Dementer(Harry potter!) walking the earth we have Spring/Summer, so expect to see Persephone walking the earth in a happy climax to the next installment).Kali Mother Earth in Hindi legend i wonder if she will play a fertile part in the new world?  Obviously names are ripped off  and nice enough but dont pretend a reference to Greek ,Hindu or even Jewish legend imbibes the film with mystical qualities. Its a cheap trick desgined to draw in the uneducated. Finally please dont try to tell me its ever so clever to spend $300 million on a film that is at best mediocre. Marks 2/5 both marks for the IT techies who created the stunts, none for acting ,plot,editing or directing.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

What?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0703560/?ref_=tt_urv","bbrownmf","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1269272/?ref_=tt_urv","16 May 2003","For everyone that is saying that Reloaded is nothing but special effects and has very little story, I think you need to go back and see the movie again. But this time, don't expect to see the first Matrix movie... expect to see something new.  I'm not going to spoil anything, but there is an underlying theme to this movie that seems to have eluded most people.  The last 20-30 minutes are very profound and totally change the way you have to think about the Matrix and what Neo has to do.This is not to say that the movie is perfect. I think there was a drastic overuse of bullet-time effects and alot of the kung-fu was pretty anti-climactic.  Some of the dialogue was poorly written too (I'm not talking Star Wars Ep1 or 2 poor, but more like really confusing and long-winded poor).  The movie still managed to captivate me, however. Learning more about the humans' current dependence on machines and seeing how Neo begins to deal with the philosophical ramifications of that fact and his place in the Matrix is a necessary addition to the movie.  If it bores you that much, well then you don't really care about the meaning of the movie and just wanted to see special effects.  But those of you with that line of thinking should more than satisfied by the AMAZING freeway chase.Bottom line, Reloaded is not like the first movie.  People say there is too much dialogue, but I think that's the point... to make you think more about what the Matrix really is.  There are plenty of clues throughout the movie--especially toward the end--to stimulate you into thinking about what will need to happen in the 3rd movie.  So don't just tune out until an action scene comes up, like all the people who say the movie was awful obviously did. Like the Matrix itself, there is more to it than meets the eye... believe it or not, you have to think about some action movies. Pay attention to this one and you'll thank yourself when Revolutions comes around. I, for one, can't wait for it now.8/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

While I re-watched ""The Matrix"" to bone up (and get re-enthralled -- I was just telling our IT guys at work when the whole computer system crashed all day that they needed to visualize the circuits connecting), I haven't yet read through the philosophical explanations at the official site, let alone listened to the discussions with spiritual authors on National Public Radio, or yet watched the background short films in the ""Animatrix"" collection, so I had to ask my son (who was at the first 11 pm pre-opening day showing) for some explanations that I just didn't get -- I hadn't even gotten that Neo is an anagram for One.What I did get, besides the return of fun fight scenes and visually complicated sets, is that Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss still look really good together and that Neo's and Trinity's love anchors the tale (and provides for droll grist with villains and prophets).Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus shrinks a bit in stature because we now see him in the fuller context of the politics of Zion, the last human city, and its relationship to the Matrix, plus entanglement in a jealous triangle (one of several going on). Because an original element in the Wachowskis future universe, compared to most sci fi movies, in addition to choices, is human emotions.Doubtless there's already a few PhD theses on the strong role of women in the Matrix universe -- what will they make of the fact that Trinity never gets on top now that we finally get a discreet sex scene? No ambiguous falling in love with androids in this war with machines, like in ""Blade Runner,"" but rather Zion celebrates human sensuality, complete with a multi-ethnic, city-wide prayer session that ends in a rave to the beat of taiko drums with a touch of ""Carmina Burana"" (if I could be sure that those frequently recurring drums were on the soundtrack I'd get it, but Warner Brothers prefers marketing to teen-age boys with pedestrian metal tracks from which only the closing Dave Matthews Band re-mix stands out). Interestingly, the women all seem to find Salome's seven veils to dance in, while the men are still wearing their grubby long johns (not that Keanu looks bad in those).Yes, we have the return of Bullet Time and balletically choreographed martial arts, which works well except for the connecting shots where the CGI turns the actors too much into cartoons. The battle with the multiplying Mr. Smiths is a particular hoot. The freeway chase is noteworthy more for its length than originality of strategies, partly because I couldn't figure out how the Sentinels or the Albino Twins could be destroyed, though its second half turn-around did have me ducking.One weakness is, as the ever welcome Harold Perrineau (of ""Oz"") comments, Neo does spend too much time ""doing his Superman thing"" with flying heroics that could either be a tribute to those movies or just plain retreads.Stay through the ten minutes of credits for a preview of ""The Matrix Revolutions,"" as ""Reloaded"" ends with a serial-style cliffhanger.(originally written 5/18/2003)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Two ultimate white guys (Neo as Christ and Smith as Satan) have to neutralize each other in order to save the Zion, the haven for the colored people as well as those who are ""computer programs"", Oracle, her Chinese bodyguard, and that lovely Indian girl.  Although Neo is the One, he couldn't have done it without the help of Trinity, and Zion couldn't have been saved without soldier-like men and women in rank and file. Machine is not the enemy of humanity. It is the Agent Smith (conservative white hegemony) whose existence serves only to destroy both human and machine world.  Neo (liberal white) exists only to cancel out his counterpart, Smith. Both Neo and Smith are nothing but our dream of good vs. evil, whereas the real heroes are every one of those (black, white, and AI) who know what the word love means.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"3","/10","Fails as a sequel, as an action flick, and as a psychological piece","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4143211/?ref_=tt_urv","TheNabOwnzz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur49216376/?ref_=tt_urv","26 April 2018","After the fantastic first film that was 'The Matrix', it is safe to say its sequels are simply money grabbing pieces of junk. The Matrix wasn't intended to have sequels, but due to the success of the first one it was unfortunately decided to create this incoherent pile of nonsense.Where did The Matrix Reloaded go wrong? First off, the fascinating concept behind 'The Matrix' is not so fascinating anymore since this sequel feeds on the same ideals, yet that kind of thing doesn't necessarily have to be a problem. ( Look at Terminator 2: Judgment Day for example as how a sequel should be ) But The Matrix Reloaded just comes across as a bunch of incoherent and pretentious nonsense because they wanted to build further on the original's ideas instead of the intelligent psychology that made the first one great. It is the kind of movie that tries to fool audiences in liking it so they can feel intellectually superior, which is something the original managed to avoid so well.Secondly, we have these terrible new characters like Niobe, Lock, Link, Link's girlfriend or something and that annoying kid that idolizes Neo which name i forget since he isn't memorable whatsoever. None of them seem to be able to act, and all of them have subplots devoid of any kind of emotional attachment to them since we first off barely know these characters due to their sudden appearance in this sequel, and the obvious fact that they cannot act ( especially that kid ). Smith has been changed to a prophet of some sort and seems to only be in this movie because of the success the first had. His character is really totally irrelevant otherwise.Third we have the obvious lazy CGI problem. Especially the scenes with Neo fighting the clones are just absolutely terrible. It uses a lot of CGI which was already dated at the time this was made and is comparable with a dumbed down weak fighting videogame. Especially the one where he pole dances around them horizontally, not sure who thought it was a good idea to put that shot in the film, but that person deserves to be fired, since it looks absolutely terrible. There is also simply put too much martial arts in it, like they wanted to impress audiences with their choreography instead of coherent storytelling yet use lazy CGI which basically ruins entire fighting scenes. The exception is the fight in the Chateau, which is one of the few pieces in this entire movie that was brilliantly filmed.Fourth we have Zion, the only human city left in the world which was mentioned a bit in the first Matrix. Yet every Zion scene is bleak, dead, dull, grey and lifeless. It has a lot to do with the characters there having the same characteristics, but the shots are ugly and the design behind the city is just terribly bleak all around. It does fortunately still have the stylish direction the first one had in scenes taking place inside The Matrix itself, and has a relatively interesting character with the Merovingian, yet it seems every little piece of strength this movie has has to come from the scenes in The Matrix, and even those suffer from terrible CGI and generally weak storytelling. There is also a character later on in the movie who basically destroys the concepts the first Matrix stood for ( stating anymore would be a spoiler ), so as a sequel it is also mediocre since it cannot follow up with an enhancement of the story, and instead overwriting it. It is both disrespectful to the original in this way, and pretentious in its own way of adding new concepts which make no sense after watching the first one.It is an unfortunate turn of events that these sequels were even created, as The Matrix was an amazing movie on its own. The smartest thing to do is to ignore the fact that The Matrix has become a trilogy and just keep watching the first one.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

If you keep in mind that this is the second part of a trilogy then the ending of this movie promise a great final in part 3. If you only like action movies this one isn't for you. If you like all kinds of genres and have an open mind to sci-fi you will love it like I did. When you are watching the movie you think ? and ? but then afterwards when you start analyzing it and thinking about it you say oh wow yea that makes sense and that's so cool. This isn't a movie where you can put you're brain in the freezer and just go see it. I think when you see the final movie and put all things together you will realize its much more then a movie. Also the more you see this movie and the first one the better it gets.So go see it if you don't mind using you're brain otherwise if you don't want to be disappointed go see another movie action packed flick.Keanu Reeves rocks.

Having just seen the movie, getting home very late while following a trail of my own mail (including netflix dvds) on the way home because I was dumb enough to leave it on the roof of my car...... but anyway, its late and I really just want to say one or two things before I pass out.First of all, this is a very good film.  The action is of course visually breathtaking, but enough will be said about that.  I found the scene with the oracle to be quite touching (considering the actress who played her has passed on shortly after filming).  Many new doors are opened and the storyline (at first seemingly somewhat simple) has now become quite complex and can turn out many different ways.  The one thing I would like to mention is:  Did anyone else get the feeling that half the movie was directed by one person and the second half someone else?  Did the Wachowski brothers take turns?  It just seems to me that the first 1-1.5 hours had a very similar pacing to the first movie and then suddenly the second hour or so just went in total fast forward.  I was dreading some kind of fatal deus ex machina, but they managed to avoid that.  It just seemed rather odd how the pacing suddenly changed.Still, all in all an excellent addition to the Matrix mythos and Revolutions (tho due to a theory I'm formulating, I think the next/last episode should be called ""Evolutions"") should be very interesting indeed.pt","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Although many people complained about this film not being as ""fresh"" as the first, I disagree. When we first saw The Matrix, we were being introduced into something totally new, and now we know that the Matrix exists so obviously there won't be something totally shocking in the second film like finding out that the world we thought was ""real"" was actually a computer program. So I think a lot of people went into the second one with a ""twist"" expectation. However, the action in this film is just plain amazing! The big brawl with Neo and Agent Smith was with lack of a better phrase, stunning!The car chase in the film was also one of the best chases in a long while. A few critics complained that the bullet-time was getting old in this film, but although they might have a point I still think that no one can do it like the Wachowski Bros. and no matter who else decides to do it in their films, The Matrix is where it all started.

But the ""unknown"" that was in the first movie isn't in the sequel. For the most part it's just more of it, with better special effects. And the movie is a lot slower. One could day that the first 40 minutes are just plain boring.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's got the same style the first one featured, much improved dialogue, more characters, more depth... it just couldn't get us by surprise as the first one did. After all, this IS a the second movie of the trilogy. There is no end and no beginning. That may be odd for some people. But that's its purpose. I believed that, after the first Matrix, the other two were going to be predictable and only a visual feast. But I was wrong. The same way ""The Matrix"" surprised me and made me think for years, I'm already blown away by the depth this movie shown. The whole idea of free will and what are the motives of human beings is, at the same time, incredibly interesting, depressing and refreshing. The first movie questioned reality and control. This one questions choice and motive. I was glad to see The Matrix Reloaded could also make me think about the universe and my role in it as the first movie did. I was thinking it was going to be impossible, once we think everything is clear when the first movie ends. Besides the philosophical content, this film is also a breakthrough in terms of special effects, of course. Never in my life I was so amazed by the quality of the fights, the settings and mostly the way the camera moved in a movie. The Wachowski are truly masters when it comes to that. I feel like I could watch their fight scenes forever. They are always creative, provoking and extremely well-done. People complain about the ""Rave Scene"", the love scene between Neo and Trinity and other minor things. I really don't understand how can you dislike the whole experience The Matrix Reloaded is just because of those (which, in my opinion, are not misplaced, just a little too long). Some may also be confused because part of the story is told in the ANIMATRIX and in ENTER THE MATRIX(computer game). I've seen ANIMATRIX but I haven't played the game yet. It's nice to see how it all fits. Anyway, believe me, not having watched it won't spoil your movie at all. Time has never passed so fast for me. The movie started and as I blinked it was over. And I watch MANY films. I've had a lot of fun and my brain was trying to keep up with the plot the same way it did on movies like MEMENTO. Mix that with the visual feast and you have a masterpiece. 10/10, indubitably.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It had everything a sequel needed... incredible action (better than the first), character development as well as new characters introduced, and an amazing, thickening plot.  As far as the ending of the film, everyone seems to have forgotten that Reloaded and Revolutions were supposed to be released at the same time, but due to the complex and technical level of the special effects Revolutions was not completed on time.  So all of you nay-sayers of the ending must remember... its not an ending, but simply a time to catch your breath before you experience the rest of the story.  This story, I might add, is an original idea... something Hollywood hasn't had in quite sometime.  The Wachowski Brothers imagined this whole thing; they didn't take it from a book or a re-make of an older film.  I know it sounds like I am the Matrix PR guy, but I am tired of complaints from movie-goers who feel the need to condemn anything that didn't come from the Sundance Film Festival or some eclectic crap like that.  This movie blew me away, just as the original Matrix did in '99.  It was well worth more than the $8 ticket price, and I will definately go see it in the theater a few more times.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

WHY","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0705453/?ref_=tt_urv","Manthorpe","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2809796/?ref_=tt_urv","12 January 2004","Sometimes a film comes along and it's seemingly endless supporters mystify me. This is such a film. While the first movie was OK, I'm baffled by how many people feel this movie is even worthy of being considered a sequel. The first one was decent, but not perfect, and pretentious in every sense of the word. The 'philosophical' babble and references are enough to make me groan. And it gets worse in the sequel.Reloaded has some awesome action sequences and decent special effects, but the acting in the movie is like the first one but worse, terrible. Keanu and Fishburne have got to be some of the most overrated actors out there, and is probably one of the main reasons I can never take these films seriously. Fishburne comes off as a complete and total tool, spouting his nonsense philosophical babble about nothing whatsoever. Had the casting been a bit better, and had the movie had a better screenwriter, this movie could have exceeded it's prequel. But as far as I'm concerned, the only reason to watch this movie is for the special effects, which are decent, but not the best I've seen.Spoilers herein:What do I like about this movie? Well, most of the action sequences are good, particularly the chase scene on the freeway, aside from Fishburne's duel on top of the tractor trailer. At one point, they look like they're practicing. But the part where the agent jumps on top of one car sending it into a cartwheel is truly awesome. I could have done without the superman bit, and the needless flying through downtown to save Trinity. Did anyone notice all of the cars and destruction Neo (what a name) left in his wake? I'll admit, it looked cool, but is one of the reasons I can't take this movie seriously. He must've killed hundreds of people just to save her. But I suppose some of the fan boys out there would say that it was absolutely necessary for her to survive for the sake of mankind. OK, whatever. If Neo is 'The One', then why would he need her? Oh that's right, because he loved her, right. The sentinels were awesome too. And the beginning when Trinity launches the bike off of the roof of a building and lands all sexy is probably my favorite part.The scene where Neo pulls a bullet out of her is useless, and this has got to be where the acting is the absolute worst in the entire film. I mean, can the dude make a different face?! Your girl is about to die!! I could do his job. It's got to be a close tie with when Morpheus is preaching his crap to the orgy crowd. Oh yeah, and hey buddy, it's not bright inside, you can take your freakin' sunglasses off.And while some of the fight scenes are cool, Keanu has a hard time convincing me he's actually fighting. They could've cast someone with better eye-hand coordination at least. He just looks lame, but that's nothing new.Alright enough. This movie is cool if you like special effects, but is not nearly what it could've been and gets way more credit than it deserves. I originally gave it a 6 when I voted, but I think a 5.5/10 is more suitable after thinking about it. And there's simply no way to forgive the Keanu butt-shot, ever.Closing thought: Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne are overrated.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The story was very interesting. The action was very good. Best sci-fi movie I saw after the first Matrix. If you keep in mind that this is the second part of a trilogy then the ending of this movie promise a great final in part 3. If you only like action movies this one isn't for you. If you like all kinds of genres and have an open mind to sci-fi you will love it like I did. When you are watching the movie you think ? and ? but then afterwards when you start analyzing it and thinking about it you say oh wow yea that makes sense and that's so cool. This isn't a movie where you can put you're brain in the freezer and just go see it. I think when you see the final movie and put all things together you will realize its much more then a movie. Also the more you see this movie and the first one the better it gets.So go see it if you don't mind using you're brain otherwise if you don't want to be disappointed go see another movie action packed flick.Keanu Reeves rocks.

If you say that this movie isnt far superior to the original, then you are tyring to act like you know movies.  From what I saw in Matrix Reloaded it makes the original Matrix look out of date.

As a sequel to the Matrix it did not quite live up to my expectations. But this I probably knew even before setting foot into the cinema. Its a world revisited, the excitement of the first movie ""what is the matrix?"" obviously just isnt there anymore. So the experience definitely was not as satisfying as the first. As the movie stands by itself, it still is pretty damn good sci-fi and a huge amount of fun. I really liked the way the storyline was presented; it left us with clues throughout and it only came together at the climax. I have watched way too many sci-fi films of late where I could predict what would happen after just 20 minutes.The action is probably where the movie really shines, it is riveting stuff from start to finish; with the Neo vs 32402039840328 Agent Smith's scene probably taking the cake.So in conclusion, my only real dissapointment here is that it did not quite have that same ""wow"" factor that the original had. However, it royally entertained me and I am very eagerly anticipating the third installment in this trilogy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","If you've heard that The Matrix Reloaded lacks deep plot thought and time-worthy dialogue, you have been deceived.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0703981/?ref_=tt_urv","windrider-1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2423305/?ref_=tt_urv","19 May 2003","I went to see this movie the day it opened.  Of course, I'd heard all the negative reviews on the radio saying it's plot was lost amongst special effects and the dialogue was only time filler.  I can understand where some people may be coming from with such statements, but I certainly didn't agree.  For one thing, if you've seen the first movie, you will remember the style of dialogue, much like ""pop philosophy.""  It was the exact same in this movie.  If you liked Morpheus' riddling way of speech, you'll be equally pleased with his role in this movie.  The same goes for Neo, Trinity, The Oracle, and virtually every other character in this movie.Those are just the basics, let's go into detail.  Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, they don't make for the best social conversation roles, which is why this movie was so highly criticized, but the Wachowski brothers were one step ahead of them and threw into the mix our aged friend - Councillor Hamann and of course, the intriguing Merovingian.  The insomniac conversation between Councillor Hamann and Neo proved a thought provoker, but not nearly as catching as the Merovingian's ""causality"" theory.  For those looking for deep conversation, ignore the cynicism and see for yourself, this movie is first rate.I can't write a proper review without touching upon the plot v.s. special effects conflict.  Yes, the special effects are dynamite and in some cases could be distracting from the plot, but that's all.  It doesn't serve as a coverup for lack of plot, merely a visually stunning addition to an already terrific movie.  The plot is there and as colorful as ever.  Not only that, but with the many given curveballs, it's not predictable, and when the movie's over, you'll be wondering ""how could anyone even think of something like that?""For my closing statement, I'd like to give one last mention of praise. This movie, compared to the other, serves up a double dose of atmosphere.  You remember what the Matrix looks like don't you?  That dimly lit world of flourescent lights, almost as though you just stepped into a Walmart. This feel stays with the second movie but with an added bonus - Zion.  It's magnificent, to go back and forth from sterile and clean to primitive and dirty.The ambience and atmosphere-amazing. The plot-flawless. The effects-stunning. The dialogue-thought provoking. Overall, this movie gets **** from **** on my record.  Watch it.  You won't be disappointed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But, let me begin by outlining what I liked about Reloaded. The action scenes were entertaining for the most part though no where near as breathtaking as the first movie. I actually have more complaints about the action than praise, but I'll get to that in a moment. The special effects were incredible even if they were unnecessary. This is where Reloaded is most comparable to Clones: it decides to use every last penny of it's huge budget (about $300 million for Reloaded and Revolutions) even if it means sacrificing the quality of the film. The masses will undoubtedly disagree with me and that's fine. I have no interest in accepting an action scene simply because it has a lot of explosions, effects, and ""cool"" camera angles. If you want to see well crafted sci-fi action scenes, see the original Matrix or better yet, see the underrated and underexposed Equilibrium.Back on the subject though, I have no praise to hand out to the rest of the film except that Keanu Reeves doesn't have to mutter things like ""I know kung-fu."" The dialogue is probably my biggest complaint about the movie. The characters talk completely different in this movie than in its predecessor. Not only that, they talk in prose as if someone out of Philosophy 101 tried to write Shakespeare. The first and most important rule of dialogue that a movie screenwriter must abide by is to keep dialogue as a two way conversation whenever possible; the Wachowski's have completely ignored this and damaged their film beyond repair. Talking philosophically is not a problem nor is having a monologue a couple times in a movie, but the dialogue tired me out after the first few scenes. There is almost no doubt in my mind that The Matrix was not written as a trilogy. Forget what we see, the basic style and attention to detail in this script is miles away from the original.There are also many characters thrown into the mix. We learn close to nothing about all of them, and they either die or remain inconsequential throughout the movie. Interestingly and eventually appallingly, a great portion of the characters in this movie are African American. What's wrong with that by itself? Nothing obviously except that they are exploited so obviously in this movie because the generation fueling this movie (sadly, mine) automatically associates black with cool. I would be offended by this whether I was a person of color or not. There's an almost orgy like party intertwined with a scene with Neo and Trinity having sex that is completely out of place. At that point my friends and I were wondering if we were even in the right movie. I don't come to see Reloaded for a dance club scene with terrible techno music. The music from the first movie was great, the music throughout this one was outright laughable, especially during the freeway sequence.That brings us to the highly praised action sequences that apparently raise the bar of the original set four years ago. The action sequences would be fine if they were just shot separate from anything else, but they each play like an individual trailer for the movie. Every single action sequence in this movie has no sense of urgency, but most importantly no passion. Also, all action scenes are set up; a personal pet peeve. I don't mind set up action scenes in something like a Jet Li movie where you go just to see Jet kick some major ass, but in something that is supposed to be as intelligent as The Matrix, it's disappointing and offensive. The reason the action scenes carry no urgency is that the outcome of the scene is obvious no matter who is fighting. Neo cannot die since he is ""The One"" so all the action with Neo is basically just him kicking Agent ass whether there are three or thirty to fight.The already deemed classic freeway scene was a huge letdown for me. First, about 99% of the cars on the freeway were from the 300 that GM donated to the movie, which is me just being picky about a movie I already loathed. More importantly, cars were being destroyed left and right for no purpose; all  300 of those donated cars were gone by the time the scene was over. Another waste of time and money was the freeway built just for this movie. Truly skilled directors (Spielberg comes to mind) would be able to find a way around building their own freeway. The greatest movie chase sequences have always come on normal roads without relentless destruction (remember Ronin, The French Connection, or The Transporter?). The only parts of the freeway scene that got my heart pumping was when Trinity was weaving her bike in and out of traffic to avoid agents and anytime the ghost-like twins were on screen (which was not nearly enough).Last but not least is the hand to hand combat choreographed by the legendary Yuen Wo Ping. Again, the combat itself is impressive, but actually dull after sometime. I am probably the last person on this planet who would admit to any form of kung-fu being dull, but it's the same thing over and over and over again until our minds are numbed and we are dumber because of it. There's a lot of other things I detest about this movie, but I fear that exposing more of my dislikes will add insult to injury. In short, the other defects in the movie include inconsistent characters (especially Trinity), useless characters (Agent Smith), a terrible ending, a convoluted and ultimately absurd plot, and some really terrible editing, especially towards the last 15 minutes or so.All in all The Matrix Reloaded is a severely hyped up letdown much like previous May releases like Attack of the Clones, Pearl Harbor, Godzilla, and a hoard of others. Reloaded is as bad as if not worse than most of these. It's a nasty thing to say, probably the biggest insult a movie can be handed, but this is a grand sci-fi world gone completely to waste. Why? First, because of a budget that's more than twice that of the original which relied on it's story to bring about it's incredible action. Second, it seems like the script was whipped up in a few days after the first one became a big hit. Argue what you want, the original was a movie within itself that concluded just fine. Reloaded makes the mistake of using its story so that the Wachowski's can direct some big action sequences. Be very cautious of your expectations on July 2nd when T3 comes out.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But thematically and story-wise, the first one is much better. Still, this is an extremely entertaining movie with action sequences that seem way before their time. So many memorable scenes and jaw-dropping moments.There are definitely flaws. Inserting completely unnecessary love-triangle garbage. More than once (the kiss scene is horrendous). It didn't really bother me, but many of the scene transitions are noticeable abrupt and sudden. And a really bad CGI scene, complete with a cartoon sound effect of hitting bowling pins.Those flaws should get me to lower the score, but I can't emphasize enough how amazing these action scenes are. And we get a full variety of different types. Most of all, the fight scenes are incredible. Some of the best I've seen. Ever.

To put it straight, the bigger the fan you are of the first movie the more you will be blown away. The story feels a little short and has a slow start but the action is stuff you have never seen before and had me all giddy in my seat (and I am a proud man =). And for the ending, well I wont go there but put it this way, I need to see the movie again just to absorb all that happened cause some new sh*t goes down! To summarize, if you have never seen the first movie, don't bother with this till you see Matrix 1. Other wise, the more you liked the Matrix 1 the more you will appreciate this.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

My advice to anyone who is forced to see it: Think of it as a parody, as an attempt to spoof the genre. Seen like that, it's sorta funny.

The storyline doesn't progress until far too late in the movie to devoid me of the desensitization for the special effects.
And when you do start seeing bits and pieces of the story in between all the choreographed fighting, your reaction is either so what? or who cares.. until possibly the very end.This movie simply tries to be too perfect. The first matrix was a better movie precisely because of its flaws , because of the cheesy dialog, because of the sparsely used special effects, because of keanu reeves' silly acting. but this movie seems devoid of any  idiosyncrasy , it's all been glossed over and airbrushed to monotony, every character portrays only a limited set of predictable emotions (not much more than their supposedly ""free will"" lacking matrix generated enemies) and worst of all, all sense of novelty is gone until the very end, where we at last see a glimpse of intrigue - of something unexpected that we could not extrapolate ourselves from the first movie.in short, the last 10 minutes of this film are what's important. and it's unfortunate that so much special effects and visual beauty are wasted in the beginning. i hope the third movie fulfills the prophecy of excellence offered by the last few moments of this second installment.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And frankly for the first half hour of the movie the pace was slow. But then I realized it did what it had to.People have to understand that the Matrix(original) was a miracle. Miracles dont happen everytime. But this movie had a very difficult task of not only bringing up the story from 3-4 years back but to build up the foundation for Revolutions. and it did it admirably. I think it did have a story, and it doesnt seem so becos we haven't seen the whole story yet..and thats the beauty here. People said too many effects...but i was hoping for that ....wot wud be Matrix if it looked like Die Hard(not that die hard is bad...it's one of my favorites)...BUT u had to be unreal in the Matrix. People said no story...blah!!..I loved the way they have created another mystery of wot's really goin on. How can Smith be outside the Matrix, how can Neo have powers outside the matrix and how can he have existed more than once. Who is the architect? I was really pondering over this stuff (and more) after the movie...and that to me means it has a story. Granted it does not have the surprise and brooding darkness and triumph of the first one...but then we come back to miracles :)...and they dont happen unless of course ""the Matrix has you""....Remember there is no spoon ;).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'm confused by anyone, ANYONE that thought the special effects were cheesy, take X2 too X55 to even compare. The fight scenes are works of art. People went in with expectations that must have been unreachable, or hated it before they saw it. I counted the days until Reloaded came out I had expectations higher than for any other movie I've ever seen. Reloaded took my expectations, threw them out the window, then drove over them 400 times in a semi. YES, it is that good. I've seen it 3 times and every time I yell at the top of my lungs during the credits because I'm that exhilarated, then do it again after the Revolutions preview.The plot, HOLY MOLY, keeps you on your seat until you have a brain collapses from sheer excitement, or thinking too hard. This movie is complex, incredible, and simply amazing. The first movie looks like a starved dead rat compared to this, but then again all three movies are really one. Acting was WAY better than average, forget all you people who say Keanu can't act, he fits the part, and does it well. Morpheus rules, Trinity good lord, Link props, Hugo MY MAN! Everyone just fits perfectly in in this movie. I feel bad that the lady that played the Oracle died because she is fantastic.

This was an above average IQ type film to me. It took me seeing it twice to really grab everything it had to offer. With this being only one half of the story (Revolutions is out in November), it's hard to judge, but leaves you waiting for more. The special effects were excellent, but could not be compared to what was being ""said"". If you have not seen this movie yet, I suggest watching and listening to the first Matrix movie again, and going into this one preparing to listen. The watching is secondary in this film. There's a lot of Hollywood hype surrounding the film, but unfortunately this isn't for everyone. You will NOT be spoon fed the plot or the story.

I absolutely loved the first movie, its ideas and effects were mind-blowing. Reloaded was definately all that the first one was but 100 times better! The action has definately improved, as have the effects but that's not what makes a movie.The story is what makes a movie legendary, and that is why the first movie has built a cult following, cause the story was original, fascinating and well executed. Our life as we knew it wasn't all that it seemed to be, but by the time the first movie ended, their was hope that human life as we know could possible return! Yet, in Reloaded the picture painted has become increasingly dark and gloomy! There's still hope yet its becoming bleaker. To me, this is one reason why people are trashing this movie! This is not a main reason but it does play a part.Also, some people may not fully understand all the complicated dialogue, therefore nullifying the plot that exists underneath it all! The majority of the plot went over my head on the first viewing but it made more sense the second time! I could understand the plot better by understanding what was being said. I wont go into details to ruin it for anyone, but by understanding the dialogue, you can understand the plot!
Another reason, in my mind, is people are forgetting this is only a middle chapter! But more importantly half a movie! It is only an appetiser for the finale to this amazing saga. How can anyone rate half a movie?! It does not stand alone as a movie and therefore cannot be judged on plot. Reloaded has just given us important details of the truth and history of the Matrix. Neo's discussion with the Architect gave the audience valuable insight into some history while also painting a bleak future for the human race. All this developed the plot from the original and left a hell of a lot of strings untied which undoubtedly will all make entire sense in Revolutions.
I'm sure without a doubt that the whole Matrix Trilogy will go down as one of the coolest and no doubt influential trilogy's of all time. Reloaded just suffers from middle chapter syndrome... a movie with no real beginning and end. Two Towers suffers from the same syndrome, its unescapable. If you take this approach, you will realise what an awesome movie this is. It developed the characters more, introduced some new concepts and characters and had an incredible amount of intense action! The cinematography, choreography and effects were of the highest standard possible. (Sure some of the effects were dicey but overall they were still right up there with the best!)Give this movie a break and enjoy it for what its worth!! Wait till Revolutions... and you'll see that Reloaded was indeed necessary and a worthy half sequel to the Matrix!!NO RATING: I can't rate half a movie!!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I attended a screening of The Matrix Reloaded, and was thoroughly disappointed. I am a fan of the first Matrix film, as it is one of the coolest movies ever produced-from the costuming, cinematography, philosophical musings, to 'bullet time'.In Reloaded, the SFX were insane, particularly the car chase sequence. But the acting was horrendous, while the plot was melo-dramatic and dull-- filler between one piece of eye-candy action to the next. I understand why people LOOOOVE this flick. It is the Matrix equivalent to Mission Impossible 2. There are thrilling moments, but the careless execution of story, told through mediocre acting leaves an awful taste. It is nowhere as good as the first film.The first half hour of the movie, that is set in Zion could have been completely eliminated and it would have made no difference to the story. It would have been a much better film.Worst moment - ""I won't let you go, Trinity. I love you too damn much!"" Then Neo precedes to pump her heart with his fist. Cool.To see the second part of the Matrix was an exercise in re-packaging. All the brilliant elements of the first film are thrown in a blender for good measure, mixed together to make crap, and sold as the real thing. The incredible special effects are there, but the great film-making isn't. But hey, go see it.

The special effects were like nothing we had ever seen and those special effects have been copied over and over ever since (check out the previews for ""Jason vs. Freddie"" if you don't believe me!).Reloaded does a good job of shoring up elements that were just touched on in the first movie.  We get to see the much talked about Zion.  We see more on Trinity and Neo's progressed relationship.  We see Neo's vulnerabilities. He may have these incredible powers in the Matrix, but he's still just a man.  He's obviously uncomfortable with the power he has been given and he obviously is unsure how to use it.  Keanu Reeves does a great job with this, and the W brothers did a fantastic job of writing dialogue that is custom feet for Reeves.I think the Zion dance scene is hot without being trashy.  I like the fact that people in Zion are darker--this small detail shows that the W brothers know what they are doing, ethnicity wise.I also like the fact that the main characters are interesting looking with character, weariness, and aging showing in their faces.  These are characters that have lived through an enormous amount of pain and suffering. What are they SUPPOSED to look like?I have ONE small comment about the fight scenes.  There ARE a couple of times when it seems like there is a contrived reasoning for a fight.  I don't fault the W brothers as much as I fault the audiences with their limited capacity for drama.  I suspect that the Ws probably put those scenes in to please the audience, rather than because they were completely necessary.  No matter though because the fight scenes in Reloaded are beautifully choreographed.  Enjoy them.A 10 of a film!!  Go see it TWICE.  And stay through to the end of the credits.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Neo is the best on screen superhero I have ever seen. When he flys it is awesome, especially when he has to save a certain lady.  Morpheus is no longer the all knowing leader of Zion, in this film they expand on the character to show he is maybe a little obsessive and is just one of a number of Captains.  Trinity is brilliant, Carrie Anne-Moss delievers the strongest performance in the movie.  You can easily see why Neo loves her so much.Go and watch this movie NOW!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If you really want to enjoy the movie, watch the first Matrix one more time, then pump up on caffeine and go see Reloaded.

But the next one is, as I expected before watching, just the banality.I found nothing new. Action scenes are verbose and trite, make me sleepy. The excellency of the previous story is replaced by the meaningless complexity composed by several couples' love stories, a frequently-heard speech by Morpheus at the dungeon, the ancient Rome-like system in Zion, the funny confession that the Matrix has a father and a mother!The only thing I think interesting is that the Agent Smith is also unplagued, like Neo. I like him very much. I'm an Agent Smith fan. I hope, at the Matrix Revolution, the hero of the movie is the Agent Smith, who turns out to be the new one, create the new world!

I loved the Matrix. It was one of the most original ideas for a film in recent years, and I love The Matrix Reloaded as well but for different reasons.  I love that this story was not developed from a book or something else...it is as original as the first because it was written by the same people as the first one. The characters are great, the story expands the realm of movie-goer thought, and the special effects need no more kudos...the rocked. the long extended techno sex scene may have been a bit much.

About half way through, another newly introduced non-character began yet another inane pointless speech.   It involved something about speaking French and it felt like it was going to be horribly stupid and long.   Then something remarkable happened.  I did something none of the characters in the flick seemed capable of:  I was able to pull the feed cable from the back of my own skull, gain consciousness, and scurry out of the theater.Once outside it was as if I was Neo pulled from his battery charger.  I was disoriented and nauseous.  I felt weak and blinked a lot.  As my eyes adjusted to the light I looked around and saw that I was not alone.  Two other humans had also broken free at the exact same time.  We looked at each other and I spoke as if for the first time, `This thing is like a headache.' They nodded and the older of the two went to the bathroom.  The younger mumbled something about going home.That left me alone to lean against the recently shut down video games. It was then that Morpheus or maybe the Oracle downloaded `the big secret' into my brain directly from the Nebuchanezzar.  The secret was simply this: the MATRIX is a digitized rip-off of the brilliant John Carpenter movie, THEY LIVE.    It was a shock to say the least and I could hardly believe it. Then I started to compare the similarities and the truth was there clear as day.   Like so much in the digital world the Matrix is simply a flashier faster resampling of the analog past.  And we all know the past inevitably suffers from the unforgivable sin of having too much content.  How could a great film be turned into something so bad I wondered, and how could the sequel be worse still?I surmised that maybe when the Wachowski brothers shot the first MATRIX they used the plot and characters of THEY LIVE but were out bullets when they went to reload.  With this realization I decided I might be able to sit through the last hour.  Plus my ride was still plugged in.It wasn't easy but I returned to plug myself back into the meandering pointless cartoon.   This time I had my own special sunglasses permitting me to see through the digital effects and bad expository dialog that held all the geeks in the theater and around the world hostage.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I did not have access to a car, and Delaware being a small town the only way to get to see the Matrix was driving to a theatre on I-23. A friend and I, however, decided to hike across a back road that was actually a state highway, risking being caught by the cops, the rain on our backs, shoes and socks soaked with slush and mud, to get to the theatre 45 minutes away(by walk). I wasn't dissapointed. I would take the same road, again, again, yet again, just to see (again) one of the most incredible sequels in movie history. The story was simply mindblowing - way more ""in-depth"" than the first and the special effects were too good to be true. A whole host of new characters are introduced, each with a unique personality of their own. Larry and Andy have taken ""slow-motion action"" to a whole new level with this film. I would disagree with some reviewers who would call the ending baseless and abrupt. I think it ended on a very apt note, with Revolutions to be released in December. I am not going to reveal any of the plot, but I would say that you are going to be involved in one hell of a ride. Motives change, perceptions alter, and the story just gets better and better. There was one point in the movie(near the end) where the story went as fast as a trailer would go. I thought they were just preparing us with a preview of Revolutions. However, I soon realized that the writers just wanted to whiz through this ""irrelevant"" sub plot to get to the crux of the story - who Neo really was, and reveal more intricate details about the design of the Matrix and why it was there. I could go on and on, but I have decided to stop. Enjoy the movie. It is your destiny!Govind Mohan","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Others are so deceptively bad that it takes just more than one viewing to realize the extent of their rottenness. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" was in every way one of the worst sequels ever. The Watchowski brothers went around saying that they planned the ""The Matrix"" as a trilogy--but what rubbish. All the gold was in the first one. Clearly they WANTED three movies but didn't think of enough material to sustain three movies.At the heart of the problem is that ""the matrix reloaded"" is a pointless continuation of a story that didn't need a continuation. At its best the first Matrix film was about revelation--the shock that comes with sudden found knowledge that undermines any and everything we believe. This idea of revelation was mixed in with Philip K Dickean sense of storytelling--the kind that doubts reality and where things fold back on themselves. And though ""The Matrix"" had a simplistic division between the real and unreal--the plot was handled so that we never thought we were watching a video game.I go back to revelation--there's something always affecting in any book or film when information that sheds light on an immediate situation is presented dramatically. Think of that chapter in a ""Tale of Two Cities""...I believe it's titled ""The Substance of the Shadow""...in which we learn the history and root cause of the central crisis in the novel. The best bits of the first Matrix film we're like this chapter.The audience is Neo.There are questions. They are expertly answered to fine dramatic effect. We can then proceed to enjoy the action that follows because we have shared in revelation.For all intents and purposes the film concludes with a hopeful ending: A fair number of our characters have made it and Neo can now save the world. How he goes about this needn't be told--all we need is the assurance that he will. In the great sci-film ""Dark City"" (which is disturbingly similar to The Matrix, despite coming out a year earlier) the city is still lost at the end, but the story is over. I did not ask ""but how did they make it back to earth..."" because I knew that's a question outside the parameters of this tale.After watching the first Matrix movie I did not proceed to ask ""but how did Neo save the world..."" No, all that was necessary was the hopeful tone at the end--this man will go about saving the world.The Matrix sequels, then, present that needless story about how Neo went about saving the world. There of course not being any inherent mystery in this mission the writers inserted plot threads that more or less undermine the staggeringly effective simplistic premise of the first film: apparently there's a cycle to the Matrix, other Neo's, etc. The plot of The Matrix Reloaded is like an RPG game: The characters visit one character, who tells them to visit another character, who actually refers them to someone else. In all of this there's no sense of storytelling craftsmanship, never any sense of surprise or revelation. It all exists to appear sophisticated: the film comes to a dead halt several times because of philosophical musings by otherwise lame side characters. And yet when Mr. Anderson calls the human race a virus when confronting a captured Morpheus in the first film--it was fitting. It was more or less a play on the ""raving villain"" archetype necessary to give motif to the baddie. It's an essential storytelling technique in the cinema. On the other hand, characters randomly going off on philosophical discussions about machines and causality in The Matrix Reloaded reminds one of writers short on ideas yet desperate to come of as more profound then they really are.What the director/writers of this Reloaded failed to realize was that sophistication of plot needn't mean confusing the audience as to what the hell is going on. No, sophistication of plot means having a simple premise or premises unfold in unexpected ways. We ask the end in an admiring tone...""how did we get to this?"" wishing to go on the ride again. When the Architect comes around towards the end of Reloaded, we ask, ""how the hell did we get to this?"" wishing to stay away from this this poor excuse for film for the rest of our days.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Early on, Reloaded features one of the dullest scenes I can remember in ANY movie, a four minute long music video made up entirely of people dancing in slow motion and some Neo-Trinity soft porn. Also overly indulgent was the appearance of a character, and references to events, that occurred in the Animatrix. Given that only a small segment of the audience would have seen the animated hype piece, this appearance was a weak, confusing part of the movie.On the other hand, the movie's strength is its incredible action scenes, which actually surpass what we saw in the original. In one breathtakingly choreographed scene Neo fights off dozen of copies of Agent Smith. Another action scene, set on a freeway, features some of the most inventive stunts and battles in car-chase history. These scenes (and a number of others) are exhilarating, original eye candy that alone make this movie a must-see.Reloaded isn't quite as stunning a head-trip as the original, though it probably couldn't be. However, it doesn't forsake the philosophical aspect we saw in Part One, which was a large part of what made that movie memorable. This time, the questions are not about reality and perception as much as they're about fate - if it's possible to know the future, can we really be said to have choice? Also interesting is the idea that machines and humans form a symbiosis, both diametrically opposed, yet paradoxically reliant on each other.The denouement of the movie, where Neo meets the Matrix's architect, was a little confusing, but intriguing nonetheless. It'll definitely be worth tuning in to the final installment of the trilogy to see how it all pans out...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Zion reminded me a lot of Star Wars and was kind of cliche. I hated the Morpheus speech because I thought it was totally out of character for him. Morpheus is not supposed to yell, it sounded awful and corny and made me start to doubt if the movie would be any good at all. However, the movie picked up after the Morpheus speech with the rave/love scene. The movie kept going until the drag when Neo meets the architect. It's hard to follow this scene because after all of the intense action we watched, we then have to sit and listen to this very monotonous voice that sits still and talks on and on while there are distracting video screens playing behind him. This part of the movie explains the most plot-wise but is also very boring and hard to understand. The MTV Movie Awards did a great spoof of this scene with Will Ferrel playing the architect. When looking at this movie as a whole, I loved it and give it a 10 and I can't wait for the next one to come out. By the way, I had to see it in the theatre three times before I finally understood what the heck the architect was talking about.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But with the release of the new movie, I figured I would sit down and watch the old trilogy once again, making it the second time I watch them. Yeah, I watched them when they were initially released, but I wasn't impressed, so I didn't bother with the movies ever since.Truth be told, then I couldn't even remember the main storyline of this 2003 sequel titled ""The Matrix Reloaded"". Yeah, the movies had that much of an impact on me back in the day when they were initially released.Well, as sequels go, then ""The Matrix Reloaded"" wasn't particularly outstanding. It was following in the footsteps of the 1999 predecessor, for sure, but writers Lilly Wachowski and Lana Wachowski went a bit further with the storyline and plot for ""The Matrix Reloaded"". Personally, I found that the movie's plot and storyline was sort of slipping out on treacherous grounds, where it was starting to become a tad too over-the-top. And that made it even harder for me to take the 2003 sequel more seriously than I did the 1999 predecessor.Like the 1999 movie ""The Matrix"", the visual effects and CGI in ""The Matrix Reloaded"" were great. Nay, the special effects and CGI were actually astounding. And I will say that the CGI team ensured that ""The Matrix Reloaded"" was made more watchable than it would have been without the CGI.It is, of course, nice to see the cast from the predecessor return to reprise their roles. I felt that Hugo Weaving, in the role of agent Smith, was somewhat not given the proper chance to take the character to another level, as it felt like the character was written a step back in evolution. A shame really, because Hugo Weaving is a great actor.I found ""The Matrix Reloaded"" to be watchable, although not really as exciting or thrilling as the first movie.My rating of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" lands on a five out of ten stars, as writers and directors Lana Wachowski and Lilly Wachowski attempted to take the franchise out on a more epic scale, but it just didn't really work out all that great.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Like X-Men 2, Reloaded is a good film on its own. But like X2, if you compared it to the original film, then you might have the tendency to nitpick on certain things.So let's get the nitpicking out of the way.In terms of the special screen effects, I thought there were no new breakthroughs except for the fight/chase scenes involving the Evil Twins. I guess the original Matrix film had really set the bar pretty high and so, in order top that, Reloaded really had to have something that's really mind-blowing. My personal view is that it didn't in general.In terms of the plot, I thought the original film had more to say. But again, this is probably due to the fact that since The Matrix was the starting point of the story, it had to be meatier in content. Reloaded does take the story ahead (quite significantly so, if I might add), but it left me feeling that it could have been so much much more (again, this is due to the high standards set by the original film). Nonetheless, IMHO, it's not as bad as what some naysayers have made it out to be. Like I said, if you look and listen carefully, you'd realize that Reloaded is actually quite a significant piece of the entire puzzle. This, at least to me, show that the Wachowski brothers are truly geniuses. I just wished that they had gone a little deeper (more elaboration).Other areas - 1). Was Neo's ""Superman thing"" an overkill? It was literally ONE too many - He did it four separate times. Three of those were necessary - Neo used them for functional purposes - and so these were okay. One was absolutely UNNECESSARY - we already had an idea that Neo could fly at the end of the original film - so no ""introductory flight"" was necessary. The impact of his flight ""power"" would have been greater if it appeared appropriately rather than just for the sake of showing it. And incidentally, I thought it Neo had some other ""new"" power, it would have made the show better - remember the mind-blowing bit that I said was missing? I was most likely referring to the lack of something new from our main man, Neo.2). Was the Zion party too long? Hell no. It signifies the humanity and human spirit, in the midst of machine domination. This is one from the literature books...classic. But then again, in the country that I was watching Reloaded, quite a bit of the scene was cut...along with the scene with Neo and Trinity frolicking...was it too long? Damn, hell no, give me more of the bodies PLEASE!All said and done, I gave Reloaded an 8 out of 10 to reflect the fact that I thought it was still good. The Matrix was a 10 - minus 2 for Reloaded for the above shortcomings. I'm hoping that Revolutions would be a 10.
Incidentally, I gave X2 a 7 out of 10 - the difference between the two sequels is that while I'd go watch Reloaded again in the theatre, I wouldn't go watch X2 again in the theatre (I'd wait for this to come out on DVD to catch it a second time).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

John Gaeta's Special FX will leave everyone else biting the dust. The intricate choreography of the fight sequences and the meticulous planning and detail that went into storyboarding the effort really shows.It does slow down a tad in the middle as it tries to show us Zion and introduces us to a plethora of characters. Also, despite the WOW factor of the new scenes, the novelty of bullet time and wire fu has worn off so other than the sensory overload, one may not be too impressed.But being the second part of the trilogy, it needs to establish characters who will play an important part in this as well as the next movie. Some of the scenes and outfits in Zion almost reminded me of Coruscant and the senate in Star Wars episode I/II.But past that , being a big comic book, computer and a kung fu nut, I cannot think of any other flick that can ever top it unless the revolutions goes one step further.But prospective viewers be warned, a lot of the one on one dialogue hacks away at the intricacies of the man-machine relationship and weaves an intricate web so follow along closely for what you hear may be pertinent but not important and vice versa to paraphrase one of these memorable exchanges between Neo and a important guy (No spoilers, but just listen very carefully after he opens a door near the end of the movie). Also, unless one is into computer programming, some of the jargon with regard to copies, deletes, purpose, backdoors, keymaster etc. may escape comprehension, I strongly advise befriending a friendly neighborhood nerd that can help you make sense of it.A kick ass movie, Wow!!!

The hand-to-hand combat is a turn off for some people, but most are ready to admit that whether they liked it or not, the execution was superb.The philosophical moments managed to flow well (for me, at least) without becoming boring because of clever background choices and a stirring music score.  It still may be above the tolerance of some people, I think.  I didn't get all the details during my first showing, so I'm left with several questions unanswered; perhaps after seeing it a few times it'll make more sense.  I'm told the video game will offer many explanations as well. The entire experience is familiar from the original movie, where many things weren't apparent until after I'd seen it a few times.The surprises were, well, surprising :)  There's a lot revealed, but even more only hinted at, leaving me hungry for the third movie in November.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie's story and multiple sub-plot are beyond and explanations, and I wouldn't even try to describe them. The only thing that I'll mention is that despite the majority of expectations, the ideas are not presented in a processed and easy-to-swallow form, there are no cheap references to Alice, the Bible and Buddha, as in the first movie (there are references, but much more subtle). There is a great replay value, as our fellow gamers would say, I reckon I'd need at least 10 viewings to start to understand what exactly they meant.Anyway, I can generalize my opinion about the movie in one line:THE GREATEST ACTION MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!! Now, the film-makers have taken every action genre and have completely redefined it! In this movie you can see the following: 1) Best Fighting Scene - There are many of those, but after you watch the movie you'll know what I'm talking about 2) Best Car Chase - In this case not only car, but truck and motorbike as well 3) Best Building Assault - In the meaning of Die Hard-type flicks4) Best Super-Hero Presentation - Everything that Superman ever wanted to be
Let me emphasize that I am not easy on giving such ""best"" definitions. But it is just unbelievable! Still, everything is presented in such a way, that I felt totally consumed by the movie, and never felt like ""Ah, their using wires and CGI here"" or ""This is shot on a blue-screen and is all fake"".For the convincing experience, there were several major factors, which are beyond special effects and post-production (there goes another numbered list ): 1) Stunning performances by the lead cast - The Holy Trinity, i.e. Neo, Morpheus and, ahem, Trinity, were truly believing in what they were doing and saying, it wasn't shallow or hollow, and their behaviour was really inspiring. 2) The love story between Neo and Trinity is now in flesh - while in the first movie it was somewhat remote and cold, this time the feelings between them are flowing like lava and you can sense the heat and desire that floats around them like halo. There was a truely amazing love scene, quite unexpected in such movie, and their romance was touching on every level. 3) Kung-Fu! In the previous episode while seeming impressive, one could actually tell that the actors are not real experts and are just made to look as they fight good. I have practiced different martial arts myself, and I am sure that all of them deserve some advance black belts. Especially Neo, who fights with the speed and grace of Jet Li or Jackie Chan. In the ""Making Of"" feature they stated that they've practiced 24/7 for over 8 months, and it is quite obvious what they've achieved. Yes, there are wires and effects; yes, there are choreography and stunts; but still, they all fight like bad-ass 17th Century Ninjas, mixing different styles and techniques, various weapons (in Neo's case, some rather unusual ones), and just the right amount of one-liners and classic kung-fu references. 4) And last, but not least - impressive sets and visuals. The inside of Zion, the hover-crafts and the sentinels were everything Gorge Lucas can ever dream of creating. The city of The Matrix, the custom build highway, the dramatic scenery and the weather effects are amazing, and add to a perfectly recreated universe, in which everything has its own place and reason.The only ""flaw"", if it could be considered as such, was some Star Wars-like council meetings and discussions, with heroic volunteering and moving, if not pathetic speeches - but again, that was part of the movie.There will be people, who would say that there's way too much philosophy, boring religious parallels and moral dilemmas, and the movie is trying to look deeper that it really is. I think that the hardest to read authors are Yugo, Dickens and Tolstoi, and yet they have written timeless classics, and I think that the multitude of ideas and analogies in this movie will make everyone think at least for a moment.In conclusion - this is the most visually impressive, technically perfect jaw-dropping cinematographic creation of all-time! A must see movie for everyone, who calls himself a sci-fi fan or even just a movie enthusiast.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"1","/10","Highlander 2 all over again; a terrible movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704716/?ref_=tt_urv","tbeekers","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2203900/?ref_=tt_urv","3 June 2003","When the Matrix 2 was announced, many years before it was actually finished, everyone seemed really excited. I did not understand why. It seems that every few years everyone together forgets the first rule of film-making: `If the 1st movie was great and a hit, it is followed by a terrible sequel'. Highlander 2 is the prime example of this, as it tastelessly tore apart the first installment of the trilogy (ignoring Endgame here).Now this film fulfilled my expectancy in being really bad, but it overshot that target. The first film wasn't as brilliant as most people claim it to be, but this one was terrible. Maybe if I was capable of turning off my higher brain functions I would've enjoyed it, but try as I might, I couldn't. The problems of the Matrix are many, and to view them best would be to look at them systematically; I shall discuss several points, from easy to hard; the special effects, the dialogue, the acting, the plot holes in both movies and the originality of this work (and it's philosophies).The special effects were great, from a very basic point of view. Once you start to look closely, you notice how this movie is more a glorified video game than a piece of cinema. The CGI imaging is thrown smack in your face. None of the subtle camera-tricks of the Matrix 1 could be found anywhere.I mean, be honest, how much CGI effects were there in the first Matrix? Next-to-none. I'll admit the CGI was necessary in some of the scenes of the Matrix Reloaded, but they were made without any care or love, just slapped on the movie. At times the faces and clothing look so unrealistic that it becomes more of a joke than an effect.The dialogue all through the movie might've been one of the biggest flaws. The biggest speeches and monologues of the film are tasteless at best, and usually just circle around the point to express it in such a meandering way that half the audience won't get it. There are three key speeches in the film, one of them about freedom and not being afraid, two of them being about fatalism. Those last two fall short of even explaining the concept of fatalism (and the first one is completely pointless), despite a handily taped in Neo going `Whoa, you mean...' every now again, for the real dunces.The acting...well, actually, I won't discuss this point much. Carrie-Anne Moss is as bad as she is in the first movie, which is too say horrible. Keanu Reeves is his usual self and as such doesn't add or detract much from the movie. Fishburne is alright. Hugo Weaving stands above the rest as a shining beacon of light, and is the only one even worth mentioning. The acting of this movie made me glad the Academy never hands out awards for SF-movies.The plot holes in both movies, though nobody ever realized this, are gaping huge. It's incredible how anybody with half a brain could watch this movie and not pick up on this. Take the whole concept of the Matrix in the first place; how do you get energy out of humans? There is no possible way to get more energy into humans than they have consumed through food beforehand? And food? How could the robots grow food for the humans without the sun? And haven't the robots ever heard of nuclear energy? Gee, maybe that'd work a bit better than the odd human battery. A computer program also pointed out to me how the whole idea of a programmed Matrix in which people die when being unplugged suddenly was ludicrous, but I'll not get into that.Next point; anyone that paid attention at the first movie might've noticed how it ended with Neo being (or becoming) the One. You might also remember Morpheus saying that the One had the power to bend the Matrix to his will. If so, Neo has no need to fight with people, he can just kill them instantaneously. It's as simple as that, if he can freeze bullets in the air, then why not freeze Agent Smith? There are many small holes like these, but these two alone invalidate the entire plot, especially that of the second one.The originality and philosophy of both movies left a lot of people sitting with gaping mouths. For instance, the whole idea that the world might not be real is original...right? Not at all, it goes back to, for example, Lewis Carroll's  `Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' and `Through the Looking-Glass'. In the second book, one of the twins Tweedle-dee and Tweedle-Dum, remarks `Do you think those are real tears?' when Alice is crying. While Carroll made his point a lot less subtle, the Matrixes just push it into your face. As for the idea of the world consisting of number, that was thought up some centuries before Christ by the Greek philosopher Pythagoras.The Matrix 2 inserted another idea; the whole struggle of fatalism (cause-and-attempt theory; because everything is caused by something else, free choice doesn't exist) and the free-choice theory, which basically stems from anthropocentrism (i.e. everything is fixed, except human choice). You must be a social recluse with no schooling whatsoever never to have gotten in touch with either philosophies before, so this is not renewing. And I'm not even going into the way this awful film portrays the free-choice idea as ultimately good and fatalism as ultimately evil (and while fatalism might be, the directly-related determinism certainly isn't).All-in-all, this is a definitive `stay away no matter what happens' film, and though I was willing to give the Wachowski Brothers a chance in this film, I now know there's no hope whatsoever for the Matrix 3. Hopefully, once the hype is completely over, people will come face-to-face with the fact that this is a terribly-made stupid action flick.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Because of the way the movie is made, it doesn't answer all the questions it raises, and as an individual movie, it'd only be a 3/10.But then again, the Matrix reloaded is made for the many million admirers of the Wachowski's product of imagination. It is quite obvious that the read Descartes as children, and that the Matrix was quite obviously fueled by other factors as very intelligent intuitive thinking and movies such as BLADE Runner. If anyone remembers the replicants, they were robots created in the same form as humans, but it turned into a war. The Matrix took that many steps further. (10/10)Reloaded has amazing stunt scenes. And let me WARN U: Very heavy philosophy, which sadly can't even be answered by watching it a couple of times. Everyone is supposed to build their own idea of what it could be, and then believe in it for 5 months before REVOLUTIONS comes out.Anyways, a great great movie. Do watch it. PLEASE.

When expectations are so high people tend to feel easily disappointed. The directors (knowing this fact) have tried to work a different enough plot in order to surprise the audience and keep it intrigued. The Matrix dealt with the topic of Reality: how do we know the life we think we are living is 'Real Life'? The Matrix Reloaded deals with the one of Freedom: is there anything like 'free will' or our choices are predetermined?.The Wachovski Brothers have also created new twists and new info enriching the amazing universe they created in the first film.All these efforts towards originality must be recognized. The problem is that the plot of this second Matrix is a total flop.Yes, I know... the script of the first film was not perfect: at the end it gets too mystical, risking the likeliness of the plot, that feeling that can be summarized with: 'Gosh... this COULD really happen.' But it was very clever and, above all, understandable.The plot of The Matrix Reloaded is a mess and it's meaningless, characters are stereotypical and uncharismatic, actions are unfounded, dialogues are obscure, there are loads of 'deus-ex-machina' and the religious part is over-emphasized frustrating the necessary suspension of disbelief. Add to all this the fact that battles get repetitive and boring.Of course I could be just a bit thick to understand the 'subtle' and difficult plot of TM-R. Maybe... but I went with two friends who I consider very intelligent: one is a physicist and mathematician and the other has a Ph.D. in Philosophy and Cognitive Sciences. The three of us agree completely: we enjoyed a lot The Matrix and we loathed The Matrix Reloaded.Matrix: a very good story supported by astounding FX.The Matrix Reloaded: a very bad story collapsed under not-surprising-anymore FX.That's the very sad difference between the two films.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

When I say 'extended', I mean to the point where they almost get saturated. You think they'll go on forever, but at the same, never for a single second do they get dull nor repetitive. The best fight sequence would be the one where Neo is ass-kicking a seemingly never-ending supply of Agent Smiths.* Awesome special and visual effects. The special effects alone are worth your ticket admission. You could be five or five hundred years old and still be in awe at the amount and quality of the special effects they've included here. The much-lawded highway car-chase sequence is no doubt the tip of the iceberg here. The other special effects are equally as impressive.* Neo's flying scenes (the black Superman!). Come to think of it, Keanu Reeves made a better impression on me here. I disliked him in the first Matrix, but I must admit that he looks waaay too cool in these flying sequences.* Brilliant, involving sound effects. Although it's perhaps irrelevant to comment on the sound effects about any recent movie, the ones in this particular film were worth enough to make me applaud them. For some reason, everything seemed much louder and more realistic. Then again, perhaps it was just the cinema. The song played over the final credits was so loud, I had to leave the session.* The inclusion of more off-beat humour. In the first film, it was Agent Smith who was the unlikely character of providing most of the off-beat humour. This sequel contains more wisecracks from more characters, Agent Smith himself not withstanding. There were times when the entire audience cracked-up, specially at the compliments Agent Smith gives himself...* Some questions from the first film are dealt with here... although not exactly answered. There are obscure explanations here and there, but it would take repeated viewings to pick-up on them.* The feeling that you need to watch this film about 300 times to understand just what the hell is going on (I love those mind-benders!). The scene where Neo is given some insight information from Colonel Sanders made me wish I studied Advanced Computer Studies back at school so I could know what he was on about.CONS* The introduction of too many, seemingly unecessary characters. The beauty of the first film was that it seemed the entire world revolved around Morpheus and his team of rebels. Now it seems the opposite has happened, effectively eliminating that 'warm/fuzzy' feeling. Then again, we must wait for Revolutions until we make any sort of remarks on just how 'unnecessary' they are.* Some extemely cheesy dialogue, especially in the Morpheus-giving-motivating-speeches department. We all know Morpheus looks awesome sitting in that red chair, but it gets a little bothersome when he's still sitting in it, talking about fate and danger's lurking outside.* The more dance-oriented soundtrack felt waaaay out of place here. The Zion scene made me cringe. Gone too was the beautiful score with those 'goosebump' qualities the first film had.* Generally, some scenes felt like they were supposed to included in the Deleted Scenes feature of the DVD (the movie could've easily been edited down to an average running time of 90 or whatever minutes).* The unmistakable feel that the Wachowski Brothers have somehow jumped on the action-film bandwagon. The first film contained a logical balance of action and mind-bending concepts. Although this second film contains both, it seems they weren't really blended efficiently enough.* The obvious influence of other recent blockbuster films that's been incorporated here: Attack of the Clones, Minority Report, The Lord of the Rings, Blade - they're all in there somewhere. The special thing about the first fim was the fact that it was in a league of it's own. Another sign the Wachwoskis are probably jumping on the bandwagon...* A rather erratic screenplay. Sometimes you find yourself going on a roller-coaster ride when trying to keep up with the storyline, not always to positive effect. The plot is highly inconsistent, always throwing something out at the most unorthordox moments. Ultimately, the over-hyped cliffhanger isn't as compelling as promised. Ironically enough, I thought the movie would've ended at another point just prior to the ending we were given (where Neo is about to 'enter'). On the other hand, it is unfair to dismiss the script for anything until we see Revolutions.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This film is everything it is hyped to be.  The Wachowski brothers deliver one of the slickest films ever and as eye-candy, it doesn't fail to please.  Behind it is a rather complex story that is possibly a little *too* deep, it definitely requires a second viewing to take it all in.  Can't wait until the third.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) believes that Neo (Keanu Reeves) is the key to defeating the machines. Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) is now with Neo. Meanwhile the machines have start digging, and will breach Zion in 72 hours. Also Agent Smith is now free from the code and is even more powerful.It's a good start to the second installment of the series from the Wachowski brothers. There's a ticking clock. It's leading to a big battle. We're going to see Zion for the first time. Agent Smith is even more powerful. But then we get to Zion.Zion is a sweaty mess. And for people with 72 hours to live, these people go have a dance party. Instead of great running battles, the first half is a very, very excruciatingly slow grind. The program world has some interesting ideas, but that also gets too slow at times. There are too many slow expositions. There is generally too much talking and not enough doing.I still love the kung fu fighting. The addition of the twins is quite nice. The first fight against the Agent Smiths is a disappointment. It turns into a CGI video game. That's never been cool in a movie to keep switching from real stunts to CG animation cartoons. Other fights are much better. Even the later fight against the Agent Smiths is pretty good.The best part is the big highway chase. That is an amazing bit of movie-making. It's a super fun time.And I like Colonel Sanders. He's uniquely original. He's certainly memorable.Overall the first half is a major drag. The movie gets better in the second half. It's a disappointing sequel, but still has great sequences.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The dialogue between the architect and Neo seemed like one of those things they shove into any plot when the directors actually found it lacked dialogues longer than 30 seconds, and even crammed all explanations history and reasons into one ridiculous 10 minute scene. The pattern became so obvious talk - bad look - fight -talk-dirty looks again - fight, that the plot structure seemed extracted from a porn movie, where dialogues are just to kill time between action scenes. The fact that mythology and some of humanity's problems and eternal questions are stuffed into it doesn't make it profound in the least, at best it seems like a badly stuffed, half-baked turkey. No interesting part of the plot actually developed and the rave party was plainly ridiculous. The Animatrix's short films had more depth and the subject was better told than in ""Reloaded"". Also, since the bullet time sequences were a success the wachowsky Bros. just gave everyone a whole lot more of the same, since surpassing the original installment was beyond (or at least it seem like that) their capabilities. The movie could have been  a lot shorter, the actions sequences and their effects were very well done, but far too long and having like 6 or 7 climaxes, Morpheus almost fell from the truck almost 5 times. 4 too many. Frankly the story and dilemmas the first Matrix proposed was far better treated in the first than in this second one.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Sometimes it did sound like they were repeating themselves and I actually found myself glazing over and becoming impatient, simply becase I thought I'd heard it all before.Agent Smith as always was a pleasure.  I missed him when he wasn't there.The action was good, but I didn't really discover anything new or groundbreaking, except for maybe the freeway scene, which was very exhilerating.  But I just think back to when I experienced ""bullet time"" for the first time in the original, I was just blown away and left speechless. Nothing really did that for me in this one.  Not that I didn't enjoy the action, though.Some people didn't like the cliffhanger ending and wanted some closure. I must ask, why?  The third one is coming out in six months.  Relax. You'll have closure then.  The cliffhanger is to build excitement and more anticipation for the third one.So I enjoyed it, but I wasn't left speechless as I was with the original. 8/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The storyline is great, most of the action sequences are amazing if not a little over the top and the ending if definitely a cliff hanger of epic proportions but its missing what made the original a classic, atmosphere.  While the original film had it in bunches this film seems to have it in places.  The Agents don't seem as unstoppable as they did in the first film and the movie doesn't have that greasy look that the first film did which helped give it that wicked feel.  But I'll admit its hard to tell the middle stanza of a 3-part story and have it stand on its own as a film.  The Empire Strikes Back is one of the few films to do this very well.  Late last year I felt that The Two Towers suffered from the same thing.  The Matrix Reloaded is definitely rife with eye candy and will boggle the mind and the senses, but don't expect it to be as good as the original, it just isn't.  But good none the less.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I went to the Matrix Reloaded for the action sequences. However, I am a supporter of action sequences that actually have meaning to the overall story, as in the original Matrix. The first 45 minutes of this movie holds nothing but needless action scenes with surprisingly little intrigue. From the point where Neo fights Agent Smith on, this movie is what is should be. The story gets going, and the fight scenes are there to support it. That French dude was a pretty cool character, and the twins were absolutely amazing. I just wish they were in it more. The highway chase scene is one of the best I have ever seen in my life. Agents, Albino Twins, awesome fight scenes...you name it this scene had it. Therefore, despite the confusing/lackluster story, I gave this movie an 8 out of 10. Not as good as the Matrix, but the awesome action scenes make up for what the movie lacks in character and storyline intrigue. As for Bellucci, she was a tier above gorgeous in this movie. Although her part is relatively small, it is extremely intrical to the storyline. Can't wait to see her in Matrix 3!!!
P.S. be sure to stay after the credits for the very first preview of THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS!!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The story takes some turns and leads us nicely into a final installment that will hopefully answer some questions...Agent Smith and his agenda?!?!The fight scenes are amazing! The problem with the first Matrix was that all of the fight scenes in which the characters moved fast were all in slow-motion. I thought this took away from the intensity of the scene. The characters on screen seldomly moved faster than the average person. Reloaded fixed this. Many scenes displayed hands, feet, weapons moving far faster than the average human can handle. This makes for a very amazing feeling of awe at every turn. If a computer was hooked to my brain, all you would have seen was the word ""Wow"" repeated over and over again.I will be seeing this, like many others, again and again.

And once the ""cookie crumbles"" what are you left with? In the case of this movie a very satisfying mind trip that makes you rethink everything you thought about the ""Matrix"" and Zion. Is Neo the ONE?  Yes, but as mentioned in the first movie - he is a ""second?!?!?"" coming.  I loved the idea presented at the end of this movie - where everything comes down to choice - and every choice has its consequences.  What is best about this movie is that it took everything you thought you knew about the Matrix and turned it on its ear.  Are all programs necessarily bad?  No.  Is Neo truly the messiah some of his followers think he is or just an anomoly in the system as the programs view him.  In the end it came down to what sacrifices was Neo willing to make - do we risk all of mankind for a freedom that those inside the matrix would never want to be part of?

My first thoughts upon leaving the cinema were ""**** me that was cool, but what actually happened?""With a bit of talking to others who saw it and after looking on the discussion boards here, I have a better idea of what the Wachowski brothers were trying to do with Reloaded, but anyway you look at it, it is certainly not as accessible as the first film, nor does it have as much as a story. That's not to say it doesn't have a story, it has about 12  - but that's part of the problem. It all just seems a bit of a mess, where you were in no doubt about the first film being an almost flawless exercise of story telling and action film-making. If you were to see Reloaded without having seen the original, I'm not sure you'd understand anything at all.I suspect this might well be one of those films you really get to like second time around - there's a whole heap of clues, hidden meanings and levels of understanding to get to grips with, which are really all too much to take in the first time.
I can't help that feel that in terms of sequels, this felt like a bit of a cross between the epic expansion of The Empire Strikes Back, and the confusion ofHighlander 2. Don't get me wrong, it's more like TESB than H2, but certainly some of the mystery and sense of discovery from the first film has been lost.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And it's not like I didn't know what was coming, because I've watched all the trailers frame by frame and read everything i could.

I would like to say as little as possible...  I believe this movie is probably most enjoyable when viewed with a firm knowledge of the plot and underlying themes and messages in the first movie, and with as little advance information of the sequels as possible.The movie rewards anyone who recognized the Christian, Buddist, philosophical (Existentialism, Nihilism and Predetermination in particular) and literary references that were abound in the first film, and while you can appreciate the movie without viewing on that level, it is a refreshingly entertaining mix of mind-twisting philosophy, mind-numbing fights and mind-blowing visuals effects.  Trying to understand everything can prove exceedingly difficult, but the engimatic presentation of the film prevent it from ever being frustrating.I greatly enjoyed the first film, and had high hopes for the sequels. Despite my high hopes and the usually subdued quality of the second installment of a trilogy, this movie completely blew me away and left me feeling throughly entertained.  For me personally, it was the single most fulfilling cinematic experience I can recall.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The development with the Smith character is intriguing, but the underlying info you learn about the Matrix, well... It reminds me of another recent movie, but out of respect for those who haven't seen it, I'll decline to compare it directly.A mini-trailer for the third film follows the credits, so if you're curious, don't leave before it's done.Any Matrix fan should (and likely will) enjoy this film.

Fear not.  Although it starts out slow, and you are wondering if this is just going to be an action movie without much plot, it quickly picks up.  The action sequences are riveting- I have never seen anything like it before and I was sitting on the edge of my seat.  But the best part, the real guts to the film is halfway through, when you are pulled into the new understanding of the Matrix and the Oracle,as Neo is. And yes,there is a twist- one that will make you confused and wonder how well you really understood the first movie, and what this means for Neo.  I was awe-struck by this new turn of events and still am a little shaken by it...This movie is not only on par with the original, I dare say it has perhaps topped the first.

That beacuse I did not belive that the ""brothers"" could make a story so good as in the first one and I never really understood why they were going to do a second and a third part.But after I saw the movie I have to say that I was pleased. The movie was great. Not as good as the first one but it was good. The movie had some great action scenes and som great special effects if you dont count the coputeranimated sequense when Neo is fighting the clones of agent Smith.The story is great I have to say. But it is kinda hard to understand. All the take about the Matrix works and how it was made and Neo part of everything is hard to understand the first time. But if you see it two ore three times you understaand and suddenly everything make sense.
And the the amazing plot turn in the end of the movie is one of the greatest. I hope they use it in a great way in Revelutions.This movie might not be so good the first time you watch it but if you give it a nother shot I think that everyone will find it to be one of the best action movies of all time. Not as good as the first Matrix but a worthy number two.I give this movie 9/10 and the nine has a big +","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The story leaves you with an incomplete feeling, which can be easily forgiven since we know that it's just half the story (or should I say 2/3's). I watched the Matrix before going to see the film, and it puts it into perspective as being the middle of the road.The action sequences were just fun to watch, and it is a comic book fantasy brought to life. It has the perfect cliff-hanger ending which just makes you beg for more. I will be seeing this one again, and will be waiting for the conclusion in November at the edge of my seat with excitement. I give this movie a 9, becuase with the fore knowledge that the story is incomplete, I can not yet say that anything did not fit into the plot, because in the conclusion more information may become available which makes everything reasonable.The only recomendation that I would like to make is to watch The Matrix before going to see Matrix Reloaded, and to see Reloaded more than once, as there are many details that can be easily missed that flesh the story out.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I think many people were put off by the introduction of new and complex elements of the story (the true, more sinister nature of the Matrix is revealed) and the overlong fight scenes.However, having now watched it twice, I've realised that this is not your average summer blockbuster. It is a very intelligent film, incorporating many different philosophies and religions. Nothing in here is a coincidence; during the freeway scene (one of the best car chase scenes ever in a film) one of the cars' license plate is DA0203. Looking up Daniel (DA) chapter 2 verse 3, we see the story of Nebuchadnezzar the Babylonian king. This story is just one of the many religious texts that is referred to in the Matrix; Morpheus (in fact also the name of the Greek god of dreams) says ""I have dreamed a dream"", which is also what King Nebuchadnezzar said in the text. This along with Descartes, Christianity, Buddhism, Godel's Incompleteness Theory, classical mythology, oriental mythology and other influences show Reloaded's vast scope.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I thought that the Matrix Reloaded was definitely a very entertaining movie that I will undoubtedly purchase and rewatch, possibly even before it leaves the theaters, but it was not as good as I hoped it would be. I have watched the original Matrix at least 5 times and was amazed and impressed, possibly even more each time, until I stated that it is possibly my favorite movie (I have to rewatch Aliens, which is what I have always said was my favorite). The Matrix Reloaded on the other hand, had scenes that I grew tired of watching for the first time. The start was a little slow, unlike the ""blow you away and totally suck you in"" beginning of the first. I do not think that it has quite the ""re-watchability"" of the first, although I cannot really say until I do so. Some of the scenes dragged on a little long. Anyway, having said all that, I definitely recommend seeing it if you are a fan, but not if you did not care for the first. This movie has a very intriguing plot, which will (hopefully) thrill those of you who like the storyline and not just all of the action. The action scenes are definitely amazing, but I think that the creators made the usual sequel mistake by trying to outdo the original. The old saying, ""less is more"" certainly applied at times in this movie. I still highly recommend the movie though!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The biggest showpiece of the summer!!!, but a slight letdown","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0705129/?ref_=tt_urv","supertom-3","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0975530/?ref_=tt_urv","18 July 2003","The first was a classic and quite possibly the greatest action or science fiction film ever. The sequel had an uphill task matching its predecessor and while it can't match it in the story department and character department, in the sheer scale of the action it manages to top the first film and that is an impressive feat.The films significant problem is being a middle part, there is no real conventional start and finish. No real exposition, and no resolution, we have the complication and the climax but we are left open mouthed waiting for the third chapter like a baby having it's ice lolly snatched away on a hot day. The opening grabs you by the nad's and sets the level for the action, once again it looks great. Then there is forty minutes of pondering, this is where the basic expo is given. There is more talk of prophecies and destiny etc and a few scenes that could have been trimmed. Neo is still unsure of himself and his new found powers and awaits word and guidance from the Oracle. He is also visited by troubling dreams involving his lover Trinity.Once he meets the Oracle and discovers something shocking about her, the action kicks in and the film shifts into overdrive. The story in this is good, it does suffer by not being told in the conventional way but of course this is a middle part so that will always be a problem, also some of the dialogue is hokey and is more noticeable in this one than the more engrossing first film.The story itself has some great revelations and leaves some interesting questions, hence my need to see the third part more so than any other follow up to another film. The cast are once again good, balancing the posterior inside the Matrix with their more vulnerable sides in the real world and of course looking like Kung-Fu gods. Hugo Weaving takes delight in chewing the scenery in this, while disappointingly Carrie Ann Moss doesn't look nearly as sexy as she did in the first instalment, usually sporting dirt and a rather dodgy barnet. Of some of the new cast, Jada Pinkett Smith is playing Trinity's black clone but still looks good (oh those eyes!) and Monica Belluci has a juicy role as a sexy Vamp, she is very sexy and steals her scenes and like some people say Belluci means cleavage in Italian, on the evidence of this it must be true.The action is the number one asset of this film aside from the fantastic cinematography and atmospheric score. All the action will blow your nuts off, especially the much talked about burly brawl between Neo and 100 Agent Smiths (yes it is true and jaw droppingly good) as well as a 15 minute car chase through a town and then on a freeway, particularly exciting is Trinity weaving through oncoming traffic at 140 mph. Only the action in the Hulk comes close to this out of the summers movies. The action really is chair grippingly, ball sweatingly, eye crossingly good.The film is flawed yes, but, it is still interesting, all that we learn about Neo and the Matrix is intriguing and the final segment can't come soon enough. Definitely the most exciting movie this year and the most groundbreaking. ****","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If you were not a fan of the original ""Matrix"" then you will undoubtedly not enjoy this film either. But if you are a fan of the whole ""Matrix"" Universe, this film will grow on you after you watch it a couple more times. I know I was one of the people who was not particularly pleased with this film when I saw it opening day, especially with all the crap that the architect had to say. ( I don't consider myself dense, or a genius for that matter, but there was way too much info jammed into a little time period for most of us to grasp.) Granted I like big words as much as the next person who likes to think they are particularly intelligent, but unless you have an I.Q. of 130 plus or have done lots of research in the ""Matrix"" world, you just won't get it. Don't get me wrong I love the whole idea of the ""Matrix"" world and yes I love these two sequels (not as much as the original of course) But I think for the most part this film as well as ""Reveloutions don't need to be seen by the casual movie-goer. But... if you are a hardcore fan like me, (which means you have seen ""The Animatrix"" and looked into it's meaning and background stories) This film as well as Reveloutions will grow on you the more you watch it. Is it just me or does it seem the whole ""Matrix"" universe has so much more left in it to explore! I know some might think this is sacrilege, but I think this is the sort of Franchise that could have the legs of ""Star Wars."" I also predict that if the Wachowski brothers don't have too many more hits left in them, (or even if they do, who knows?) they will come back to what made them famous and help us and everyone who loves ""The Matrix"" and explore it in a few more films, TV series possibly, and games. I know I look forward to it, and I would be willing to bet my life that we have not seen the last of ""The Matrix!""","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"8","/10","While visually wonderful and continued to be groundbreaking for its time, narratively hugely disappointing contrived sequel that wasn't necessary. Explosive but empty","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7670219/?ref_=tt_urv","mickman91-1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10294945/?ref_=tt_urv","22 December 2021","The original Matrix is one of the greatest films of all time. It was revolutionary in its production techniques, it was totally original in its style (late 90s industrial gothic martial arts), and most importantly it was an incredibly intelligent story about reality and spirituality packaged into an exciting and enjoyable hollywood action movie.The Matrix Reloaded retains 3 of these things. It takes the action sequences and production techniques available at the time to a new level. It maintains its original style and atmosphere (Marilyn Manson and Linkin Park on the soundtrack - yes please!). However, where it falls short and what makes it ultimately fatal is that there is very little intelligent story. There is a surface level plot, which is much thinner than the original Matrix and could probably be summarised in 10 seconds, though it does mostly make sense within the universe. But there is absolutely no intelligent depth to this one. There are a couple of soundbites that suggest a deeper message and make you think for a second. But other than that the film feels totally vapid without a meaningful belly. All of the action (which is what carries and which is most of the films running time) though visually stunning, especially for its time, feels empty without the depth of characterisation and purpose that made the original Matrix so wonderful. Because the Matrix is so unique and the first film so great, it isn't just disappointing that the second one fails it is very sad and tragic for fans of the original because there is nothing else like it that we can rest our hopes on.The original Matrix was perfect in every way and was complete, it did not need a sequel. While I don't know if this is true, it feels as if due to the success of the original it was decided that sequels would be made. So they retrospectively concocted a way for the story to continue. It doesn't feel a natural or organic furthering of the story, the whole thing feels contrived. And unlike the Fantastic Beasts universe for instance which was contrived for the fans after the conclusion of the original Harry Potter series, but which is actually very good and almost as much work and passion has gone into it as the original, The Matrix Reloaded feels like very little work was done on the narrative (and all effort put into the action sequences), so in short the whole thing is a drag.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Yes. Is this movie as good, but not better then it's predecessor ? Yes.Does it have good Action sequences ? Yes. Can it drag and not accomplish as much as it could ? Yes.Does it have a cool ending ? No.This sequel is as good, but not better then the original classic before it and for what small problems it contains, it ends up losing a couple of points.The film doesn't really have a real huge storyline like the first one due to everyone already knowing the main premise and all. The Wachowski Brothers just want to compete with the summer movie market of blockbusters by rushing through all the philosophical discussions and simply just wanting to show constant struggles and please the ""adrenaline junkies"" who can't have enough peril in their lives.There are some cool new characters that even steal the show ( The Twins are cool bad guys that should have returned in the third one because they're so awesome ! ); there are troublesome bad guys like The Merovigian, who you just want to die because he's so cunning and slick as a whistle, as well as the return of Agent Smith. There are other characters who appear, but you don't get to know that much about them like Niobe and Ghost ( played respectively by Jada Pinkett Smith & Anthony Wong), but you get to know more about them if you play the video game spin-off ""Enter The Matrix,"" but thats a shame because not everyone here plays video games ( I do personally, but still ).Either way if you want a cool, slick flick that doesn't require too much thinking, but yet can still make you ponder & stay interested, then by all means watch this.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Actually, I really didn't know what to expect besides the return of Agent Smith. The evil agent's henchmen were all the wiser in skipping the sequels. I heard that Tank was strongly disliked by his co-stars that he was voted out of the sequel. Lucky him.In the second film, we are introduced to a bunch of new people as the citizens of Zion. Why anyone would want to live among a bunch of wanna be cool twits wearing shades is beyond me. My first impressions were that these people of Zion are just way to cool for me. Any sympathy and caring for anyone in Zion quickly went out the door. Pinkett-Smith (Will, what the hell do you see in her???) has way too much attitude for me to even take seriously. Morpheus regresses from a mysterious leader into a Zion whipping boy and has to take too many orders from too many ""chiefs"" who seem to take a delight in revealing how incompetent he is. The special effects were mostly good, except that one scene where one of the rasta haired albino twins jumps on the hood of the car, that had fake written all over it. Surely they could have done that better, couldn't they? The movie had it's moments like everyone's favorite Neo vs. the 101 Smith clones but after leaving the theater I suddenly was not in a rush to see the third.Which brings me to the third. Again, I have a problem with the people of Zion and their terrible attitudes. Did someone take a dump in their Tastee Wheats? My god the leaders were a bunch of grouchy jerks. Why do they behave like such as$holes? All except the Asian guy, who is so silent and so lack of any personality that we really don't care what happens to him either. My favorite part was the train station, kind of reminded me of ""Ghost"" with the subway bit. Though I didn't like the part where the Indian woman rudely tells Neo that he doesn't belong here. ""Go back to India - b--ch"" should've been his response. Agent Smith goes through a personality change and suddenly Neo's cool mannered nemesis turns into a raging psychotic bloodthirsty killer. Was this change needed? Again, Zion could get whiped out entirely by the ""squiddlies"" - and who cares? It's hard to be introduced to these new characters who were never in the original and have any feeling for them besides: WTF are they doing here now? Morpheus, Neo, and Trinity deserved a better fate than to be left in this ho hum city full of losers. I'll take the Matrix covered surface any day.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

People probably had this vision of what they thought Reloaded was going to be, so just because it doesnt match their vision, its no good. Thats just plain stupid. This movie has the best CGI I've ever seen and the burly brawl was awesome, lets not mention the freeway scene, which I can say is the best car scene in movie history(as promised by the film makers). And more importantly, the movie has an awesome story. The concept of decision was a good storyline to introduce. The concept of making two decisions(in programming a 1 or 0) was an awesome touch. only true computer programmers(ie: geeks) will fully appreciate each touch that went into the movie. The concept of ""backdoors"" was cool, and the thought that each thing in the matrix is a program was cool, oh, and how they said programs can go into exile either then being delete was cool, making programs think.The only thing I can see wrong with this movie is...that it stops in a very harsh way. That was just wrong. The movie has its ups and downs just like the first one. They can't be judged together because they deal with two different concepts of life. The first one dealt with personal conflict and meaning of existence. The sequel dealt with the origin of existence and why/how we are here.The Matrix Reloaded delivers the best action and story since Star Wars(original trilogy).I can really only see 2 things i didnt like about the movie 1.) no gunplay, too much kung-fu, but i understand 2.) we have to wait another freakin' 6 months for the rest of the storyout","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Matrix Reloaded is an absolutely stunning picture and I dare anyone to go the cinema and not enjoy it.  The action sequences are amongst the best ever put to celluloid and the storyline which has left so many scratching their heads, will I believe, make more sense after repeated viewings, and will be put straight when Revolutions reaches our shores in November.Perhaps it didn't have the same effect as the first film because we knew what to expect but it is still a brilliant film.  A must see for anyone who watched the first film and was amazed by its originality and storyline.

Directed and Written By The Wachowski Brothers *****/*****In this brilliant follow up to the 1999 hit ""The Matrix"" Keanu Reeves reprises his role as the Computer-Hacker hero who is the only chance to save the last real city Zion. Picking up shortly where the 1st film left off Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) are heavily in love and a long with prophetic mastermind Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) must save the city of Zion from thousands of machines invading and destroying the city. In this film you learn a deeper meaning of what the matrix really is and more is uncovered.Overall the film packs a punch full of explosives with it's dazzling special effects and fight scenes. Even though the now famous ""bullet time"" has been parodied in countless films and even commercials, it still remains fresh and even better in The Matrix Reloaded. As for the sroryline I loved it. Many things that go unanswered in the The Matrix are answered in The Matrix Reloaded. Many scenes may leave you questioning different theories of what the matrix may really be. Certain points in the film leave you feeling like you know what's going to happen but then suprises you. The performances were all great. Keanu Reeves' character Neo is probably the most well-fitting character he has played since Ted from Bill and Ted. In the end The Matrix Reloaded is a state of the art action flick with a good story to back it up. The movie leaves you in suspense with an unexpected ending and leaves you in excited to see The Matrix Revolutions.

What is control? What is power?Neo comes face-to-face with these questions in Reloaded, and so did I.

the story is pretty much incomprehensible, and though the first was somewhat similar, it was a tough act to follow because the story itself required it to. here 'weird twists' seem to be put in just for the sake of making the story confusing.one thing that ticked me off was that the last one was rated R for the action. this one even though it has action has unnessisary nudity.don't get me worng...reloaded has its good parts, the action sences are amazing, especially a chase sence on the highway. the animation is great...but to make a great flim u also need a followable story...in the end the matrix reloaded is a good flim, but considering the time it took to make, it should have been great. no way near the original. more of a action animation bluff. and i hate movies that end with ' to be concluded'...a 5/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Since I didn't have Matrix in such a pedestal, I enjoyed Reloaded (as entertainment of coarse). The Matrix to me has always been escapism, nothing more. The film might include philosophical issues such as man vs. machine, what's real and what's not real? But the reality is that The Matrix phenomenon is more of a technical one.Philosophically, the film contained the same content as the original, it only gave it the logical push, like a logical progression of the discussion of the themes dealt with in the original, there are several scenes that are just pure philosophy (Herbert Marcuse to be accurate). On the bright side, all of these save the film from being a totally hollow experience, however, the philosophical content feels like a burden due to the fact that it doesn't blend easily with the level of action. The film jumps from a scene loaded with lot's of philosophical speech to just high octane action, making the mix rather sloppy. We also have to remember that the subject of man vs. machine and what is real? Has already been dealt with in cinema, in such films as Blade Runner and Terminator.The acting was as bad as in the original, or worst, and yes the screenplay was very poorly distributed, the first 30 or 40 minutes can be removed, they add nothing new to the story, or to the characters, making the first portion of the movie hard to endure because they have no purpose or meaning, or as the extremely funny Merovingio said, they did not have a why, it was just dumb and disorganized exposition. But when the Oracle makes it's appearance, well into the film, the story gains a purpose, a reason, a why, and so from there the film improves. When I say improve, it's within the Matrix context, because then we have the long fight with the Smith's, which on the plus side, it was funny and surprising in terms of technological advances. Then there's the talk with the comical, pedantic and pompous Merovingio, which is a considerable highlight Then there's the incredible chase scene (probably the part when the audience gets their money's worth), since Ronin I had not seen a good chase scene, and this one is really amazing, it was like 20 minutes long but all of those minutes were exiting, following textbook 101 in cinema car chases, having a fast pace, a difficult production, and all of the story depending on the outcome of the chase. Finally, there's the infamous talk with the Architect, I would have found it fun to cast Jason Alexander as the Architect, that would have been fun, of coarse, he should have been serious, but just his presence would have taken some strain off such an overly turgid scene, long and complicated stuff about the Matrix, all those ergot's, vice vs. and a propos were confusing and eventually lost interest. Finally, the end was just a little too gratuitous, being exactly what you could have deduced from half an hour before. Nevertheless, the film managed to cook up a little cliffhanger, perfect to create anxiety for part 3. However, the film had many flaws, but I think that movies that come in summer have a disclaimer implied on them, the film you are about to see has very few depth and emotion, only CGI, and gang-bang combined with punches and kicks. Just see some summer films, and compare them with the ones that are released at the end the year. Matrix has and will always be summer pop-corn fun, not smart, provocative and charged with meaningful emotions conveyed with great performances, the film is an example of first-rate use of stylistic resources like sound, effects, etc. But that is it, but if you add some small philosophy, you get an entertaining film, just like the first Matrix, or then tell me, did the first had good performances, or a serious approach to important and provocative themes that have never been seen before... no, it was action, effects and small smart philosophy conveyed in a cool and appealing style(leather, sun shades, guns, groundbreaking CGI) that's it, that is I think the perfect definition of the Matrix phenomenon, which although entertaining, it is just that, low-brow entertainment.I personally enjoy the films because there's nothing wrong with well crafted entertainment that serves as exiting escapism, cinema has a long tradition of creating films that make us fantasize about other worlds were there's good and evil, and the fate of people is decided by gun fights, karate and chases. Being a fan of the classics that started this tradition, such as James Bond and Indiana Jones (which are immensely superior), I can honestly say I enjoyed both Matrix and now Matrix Reloaded, because I knew what to expect, if people were expecting a film with good performances, and an intelligent story, well no wonder they hated it. To sum up, I liked Reloaded just as I liked Matrix, because both, although they have lots of pretensions, they just reach a pop-corn summer movie level that they are meant to reach, which is exactly their reason, their purpose, their why. I really hate people that think Matrix is more than that and who claim that the first was a great cinematic achievement, they are wrong, it was entertaining, and had it interesting advances in CGI, but it is just entertainment and it will never surpass that. If you search great recent cinematic achievements, then see Lord of the Rings, or any of the other films that are more than just entertainment. Matrix and Matrix Reloaded are fun and enjoyable to watch, they are totally satisfying on an entertainment level.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Excellent movie that enhances the original!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0703248/?ref_=tt_urv","sorrow","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0337294/?ref_=tt_urv","16 May 2003","I must confess: I never much understood all the fuss over the original Matrix from 1999, and I still do not. I left the theater after seeing that film having enjoyed myself, but by no means would I have classified the film as being worthy of having its name mentioned in the same breath as epic classics like the Star Wars trilogy. Further, it rather annoyed me when people made such a big deal over the film's shallow and unoriginal pseudo-philosophical ideas or its thinly drawn characters. In fact, although I did enjoy the first Matrix, the ridiculous mantle of greatness that people heaped upon its shoulders left a bad taste in my mouth that pushed me away from further viewings or even from looking forward to its sequels which, in my opinion, seemed unwarranted as I thought the original resolved quite nicely and left little room for sequels.	The Matrix Reloaded has changed all of that for me.	While The Matrix pieced together several unoriginal ideas in flashy and self-consciously hip ways with apparently little exciting thought beneath the surface or little effort to make them cohesive within the logic of its own framework, The Matrix Reloaded turns this analysis upon its head and reveals that the apparent inconsistencies within the first film were actually setups for a major twisting of what we thought we knew was happening. I will not spoil anything for those who have not seen the film, but I thoroughly enjoyed the genius of how the filmmakers redefine the events of the first film with this one and leave the viewer with a whole slew of possible scenarios and thought provoking questions at the film's end. What I find most impressive of all, is that I detected the hint of what might actually be a truly insightful and meaningful commentary on naturalism and miracles and the error of confusing an explanation of the facts with a proof of the relationship of said facts.  If I correctly surmised the presence of this theme, then it is one upon which I hope the third film expands. For those who have seen the film, the key story points that resulted in the one hundred and eighty degree turn in my evaluation of this film series occur during the Oracle scene, the Agent Smith(s) scenes, the Architect scene, and the finale.	I left the theater feeling extremely entertained and filled with both thought and that certain child-like sense of wonder that woefully few films ever manage to capture for me. Yes, with The Matrix Reloaded, The Matrix trilogy has catapulted itself into the realm of true film greatness in my estimation right beside the Star War trilogy and The Lord of the Rings.	Now I would not want any reader of this review going away thinking that I am unaware of the film's shortcomings. Indeed, it has many blemishes including: a few beautifully imagined and choreographed fight sequences that, while artful, were a bit too lengthy and too obvious in outcome to be fully satisfying; a dance sequence and sex scene that, while again done artfully and with nice cinematography, seem rather unnecessary and a tad too much like a music video sequence; some over-acting on the part of Lawrence Fishburne; a lack of chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss; and a slight tendency for some of the fight sequences to become cartoon-like in a film that wants to take itself seriously. In fact, these flaws led me to conclude half-way through watching The Matrix Reloaded that I would leave the theater disappointed because the film would not have even measured up to The Matrix  a film that I viewed as only being decent. Thankfully, however, the last twenty to thirty minutes of the film when combined with some details revealed in earlier scenes completely reversed my opinion of the film and even made a better movie out of the original in my eyes.	In summary, I loved The Matrix Reloaded - beauty, warts, and all. Thanks to the greatness of this film, I also have a better opinion of the first film, and I am counting the days until I can see what I hope will prove to be a very satisfying and epic conclusion in The Matrix Revolutions. In the meantime, I think I will go see this one again!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And if you think there is a better way to spend your time and money than going to see this movie then you probably should not have bothered in the first place. Obviously you weren't paying attention and don't understand the philosophy of ""The Matrix."" How else would you fail to grasp the simple concept of the directors to split the final chapter of ""The Matrix"" into two segments? Perhaps you would have rather had them take shortcuts with the concept of the movie and push the story into one movie that would have devolved into nothing more than a 2 hour fight scene. ""The Matrix"" is about more than special effects, it is about what drives the human mind. If you cannot see the real meaning and philosophy behind the movie then I'm sorry you wasted your $8. Next time, give it to me, and I'll see the movie again. This movie ranks up there with the greatest films of all time. Like ""The Matrix,"" it will change the way movies are made and what is expected in it's genre. Other movies out this summer do not even compare. I saw X-2 two days before Reloaded and thought the special effects were great (where was the plot?)... then I saw Reloaded and everything changed. I plan to see Reloaded as many times as possible before it goes out of the theaters. Casting was great and the acting was perfect, the characters had more depth and you could feel what they felt. I have to give this movie a 10. It's nothing less than that.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

To those that would criticize the plot of Matrix Reloaded I say ""open your mind"".  The single characteristic of both Matrix movies that sets them apart from the norm is not their innovative special effects, but rather their philosophical approach to story telling.  What some view as a weak plot is truly the greatest aspect the movie.  Simply put, the answers are not fed to you!  The Matrix Reloaded challenges you to think, to grapple with questions that transcend the movie, and to ask ""why?"".  It explores human emotions such as love and hope, and then pits these emotions against logic and reason.  The viewer is meant to struggle with these questions in the same way the characters do.  In this way the characters become all the more real and believable.  That being said, the special effects in the Matrix Reloaded are once again mind-boggling!  The level of detail and magnitude of action are unparalleled!  This movie is truly a must-see, one of a chosen few.I give this movie 11/10!  Yup, 11/10!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But for a sequel this was as good as it gets. One can never hope to create the kind of aura and mystique that the original matrix had. We know that the matrix is a computer program , we know that zion is where humanity lives and we all know that neo is the one. So frankly I was never expecting anything different from the story except that it proceed logically , which it did. Neo , Trinity , morpheus look stunning as usual. The new members of the gang like niobe and link (tank's replacement) play their parts. The special effects are quite stunning to say the least with a 14 minute car chase + bike chase + fight on top of a truck being the centerpiece. The look of zion is exactly as it should be ; dark , depressing and gloomy. The background score does add effect to the fight sequences. All in all , a complete bang for your buck and it will you waiting for the revolution in november!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What 'Reloaded' had going for it was two above par chase/action sequences: Neo's staircase assault and a wonderfully, never-ending freeway chase scene. Beyond that, it was filled to the brim with enough fluff to supply George Lucas with another 'Star Wars' prequel. The Wachowski creators obviously knew what audiences wanted: more, ah-hem, ""smart"" and ""biblical"" dialogue, more action, more green and characters. They succeeded. In a good way? Not really. The so-called smart dialogue was so laughable, that when it was over I longed and actually had to plug in the MTV Movie awards spoof with Justin Timberlake and Will Farrell that made me crack up on how silly some of the 'Reloaded' scenes/dialogue really was. Again we have Keanu Reeves acting his heart out – albeit disastrous – and asking 'why, why, why' or a million other questions every 2 minutes of screen time. Seriously, we're supposed to believe Trinity actually fell for this doofus and that everyone else believe he's the ""One."" Aside from a short 'Scary Movie' segment on this film and the Will Farrell ""ergo"" clip, I wouldn't mind seeing a feature-length spoof as there's plenty to ridicule. Too harsh? Perhaps. After all, it's not as bad as the one that follows. And it's definitively watchable. Again, the Oracle steals her scenes, and (only) some of the special effects were top notch –the fight of the million Smiths was enjoyable, but it was like watching a kid play a Nintendo64 game. Summary: Neo's struggling in his 'Superman' role while real humans plan to ward off machines who plan on murder. Somewhat recommended, though people should've stopped at #1.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The fight scenes were great but seemed to have been ill planned. In the 1st Matrix the characters fought when they had to. With the exception of Neo- all other characters in the Matrix Reloaded should have tried to avoid confrontation with the agents leaving the element of a threat. The new agents did not seem as much of a threat this time. New characters like the twins were introduced but what the heck is their purpose and what are they?

But when I heard they were making sequels I was surprised. I never really had any interest in seeing the sequels, but I was given free tickets and went in 'the spirit of having a good time'. It was crap. That may not be an intellectual comment... but the film presented the most assinine spirituality and tried to pass it off as clever/significant to a largely gullible teenage audience if my screening was anything to go by. It cost me nothing (the ticket that is) and I still felt ripped off. I liked the white restaurant sequence a 'tad' because it promised to bring something new to the party, namely, sex (it didn't though, and I'm not even counting the interminable rave party scene Eisensteined with a sterile Carrie Moss Keanu Reeves make out leaving me limp sequence). One good car chase sequence, but is that the best they can do.. trailer at the end of the film left me, let me say, underwhelmed.

The freeway chase, the mansion fight, the park fight, all of it is excellent.  Some details are a little hazy as far as what exactly is happening with Smith but all in all it was not a disappointment.  The MAJOR problem with the movie was the unnecessary orgy like dancing in the temple by the residents of Zion while Neo and Trinity are making nice.

This seems like pretty much everything it was hyped up to be.I do have to agree that a couple parts were overdone.  The whole dance scene at Zion is waaay too long.  It brought tedium and did nothing to enhance the movie.

Fans of the Matrix that understand the story will have more fun with it then your average Joe. But even people that don't quite grasp the story can appreciate what the Wachowski Bros have done with this solid sequel. The action sequences have to be seen to be believed. Don't wait for it to come out on video, it's just not the same, this movie was meant to be seen on the big screen. So how does it compare to the original? Well, if you're like me, you might view the original Matrix as the greatest action/sci-fi movies ever made. Saying that, Matrix II would have to do some amazing things to surpass it. Reloaded acutally is better than the original in many ways and not as good in other parts, but the action sequences,wow... you really have never seen better in an action movie, I guaranteed it! I have to say, the story is not as deep as I wanted for the ""Matrix"" movie, I wanted more ""thinking"" involved, but action was definitely the concentration of the Wachowski Brothers in this movie. The introduction of ""Zion"" was nice, but they should have spent more time on explaining the new characters and less time in the city. But this movie is leading to something big at the end of the year with the Finale of the Matrix. I can't wait for the final movie. All in all, Keanu, Fishburne and Moss are doing what they do best from the orignal, kickin' Agent rear and this is just more of the same, and being the Matrix all over again, how can anyone not like it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The story carries over extremely well, and the visual effects are nothing short of incredible. There's just the right element of action, drama, and a little humor to keep you riveted. Now, the critique. I have to say, despite the immense coolness of the fights, some have the fringe tendency to drag on a little too long. Not by much, but the feeling is there. Also, I was hoping the twins configured more heavily in this film, but they don't get quite the screen time they should have had. Major gripe - what happened to Tank? He survived the first movie, but here he's disappeared. There is a tiny hint that might be the answer, though.The superman thing - woohoo. The last time Neo does it is, not to spoil anything, intense. Now, the ending. Yes, when that cliffhanger jumped up there, I did emit a choice combo of profane vocabulary. But at least it keeps us wanting to see the third. Also, the game that adjoins the movie is superb. See the movie, then play the game.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I found it to be a slick, sophisticated little piece of what would ordinarily be Sci Fi fluff. The story was clever, intense and kept the viewer nicely wired right from the word go.Not so the sequel. From the drab, boring opening sequence, the film is a let down. Gone is the hip, high energy sound track populated by 'name' bands. Instead we have meaningless, banal tracks of little substance that do little to add to the film. Imagine some of the key scenes from Matrix I without the soundtrack? And the sound effects leave a lot to be desired. The fight scenes (and God knows there are a lot of them) lack in the impact of the first film, there isn't the same energy or 'feel' to them- you don't get excited, you get bored as the fighters catch air with every second blow.Bullet time is so chronically overused that it ceases to have any impact. An endless stream of confusing dialogue and poorly developed characters with nowhere to go does not help, and to make matters worse most of the film is Neo walking through a series of fights with little purpose or intensity. What should have been a thrilling battle between Neo and multi-Smith was unimaginative and repetitive.And to top it all off, the film is *boring*. I found myself almost nodding off during the long, pointless monologues, including a particularly pointless scene with a ridiculously cliched French program I didn't even bother catching the name of.Bottom line- DUD. If you don't believe me, by all means blow your cash, and then honestly tell yourself it is even a shadow of the original. And where, for Pete's sake, was the cool cool idea of uploading new programs into the characters? Who can forget- I know kung fu.

But why is this?  Could it be that it is the sequel to one of the greatest movies ever?  Even though it should go without saying that this movie should be excellent, does it really hold water?The answer is yes!  This movie stands above the crowd and shines with all of the glory that an action movie should shine with.  Notice I said ACTION movie, not ACTION movie with heavy underlying PHILOSOPHICAL undertones. I did this intentionally because that is what this movie is, an action movie. Regardless of what its precursor was, it is still an action movie.  But as an action movie, The Matrix Reloaded takes the cake.Many people will go into this movie thinking that it will follow in the original's footsteps and be yet another thought-provoking piece of philosophy wrapped in an action film's shell, but they will only be met with shallow attempts at deep questions involving choices and control.  Not that it was not a noble attempt by the Wachowski brothers, but it just doesn't work with the entirety of the film and it almost feels forced.  With mind-tingling questions like, ""Am I really in control of my life?"" and, ""What is more important: the choices I make, or the reason why I make them?"" the movie shows incredible promise, but falls short in the actual delivery of these questions, and the relating of them to the story.Back to the real reason why I am writing this (SPOIL-FREE) review: the REVIEW.  For a die-hard action movie, very little will beat this movie. It has Kung-Fu fights coming out-the-wazoo, each of which are pulled off to perfection.  The outstanding special effects are more than realistic, at certain points in the movie, I was sitting with my jaw practically on the floor because of the realism.  Not that they are perfect, but they do their job: they entertain and actually let the audience forget that they are special effects. For the ladies (meaning no disrespect), there is a believable love between Neo and Trinity, and a semi-intricate web of pasts to explore.  But beneath all of the Lovey-Dovey romance and hocus pocus special effects, the movie is based on action and serves its purpose as a entertaining and very enjoyable film.I am ABSOLUTELY going to see this movie again and again because I enjoyed it that much. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that enjoyed the first and to everyone that likes a good time.Overall Rating (As an action film): 9.5 (Which rounds to a 10)Sincerely, UFO","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Incredible, Overwhelming, confusing, and most importantly, never disappointing...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0702829/?ref_=tt_urv","foppa69","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1553683/?ref_=tt_urv","14 May 2003","Just when you thought you'd seen it all, there arrives The Matrix Reloaded. So much had the first movie touched, so much had the first movie delved into, and all the while it kept you fascinated to quiver in anticipation for a sequel. So the Wachowski brothers announced two sequels, not one. Then you thought, hmm, another trilogy eh? They sure are confident, I hope they know what they are doing. Well, I have news for you. They presupposed and firmly believed what would unfold four years later would impact the lives of millions. They found themselves amidst a movie so hyped it made you think it was more than just a movie, forced to deliver a revolutionary and refreshing sequel(s) to appease those enthralled by the original. To live up to that can be unbelievably challenging (think of what happened to Men in Black 2). And they succeeded.Wondering why they delayed the first sequel only to throw the final of the trilogy only months afterwards? Seemed a bit presuming didn't it? Maybe a little curious? Well, wonder no more. They knew that after seeing the second movie, no one would be able to bear any longer than a few months for a conclusion. So expect The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions (coming in November) to be more of a two-part sequel, which is infinitely satisfying for two reasons. First, if you are like me, the original will forever stand out as the groundbreaker, much like the original Godfather or the original Star Wars. To compare the original to the sequels is just unfair and degrading both to the film itself and the impact it had upon society. The original will always be the best one, there is no argument about it (you'll find this holds true in the IMDB top 250, the original Godfather, Back to the Future, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, etc all reign above the sequels). I prefer to think of it as a childbirth. The parents are the original and the baby is the sequel(s); without the parents, the sequels are nonexistent, and even though the baby sometimes outdoes the parents, the parents will always stand out as the source of the greatness. The original made the trilogy a reality. It introduced this entirely fictional plotline to you (yes, even the Godfather was entirely fictional, although there are many that suspect Mario Puzo had real-life Mafia ties..) and made you believe it, hell, it made you awestruck by its sheer brilliance. There are so many layers: the acting, the casting, the roles, the logic, the personalities and races represented (many for such a small core), the philosophy (so true and believable, yet exploratory), the action (best action and martial arts ever seen? Quite possibly), the list goes on and on. It's hard to fixate on what exactly made the movie, and it is for this very reason that it is so excellent. The movie will overwhelm you, so long as you are ready and willing to be overwhelmed. Some will disagree and those that do simply do not have the openness to be affected by this movie. But, for those that are antsy for something to compel and fascinate, this film is what you are looking for. For those that are in need of a refreshing movie, one that prevails against the common trivialities of life itself, one that conquers the human emotion such as to hold it in its hand, one that inspires and teaches but doesn't harass or intimidate, one that does, well, just about everything in one except disappoint, then the movie you are looking for is The Matrix Reloaded.Second, (yes, this is still the 'two reasons' continued...) this movie introduces a new way of storytelling; the original, which was not created with two sequels in mind, was made to infest itself in the minds of those who watched it. The sequels collectively then work to form new movies and inexorably a trilogy, but they work together to coalesce the three into one, while maintaining the stand-alone feel to the original and the 'new and improved' feel to the last two. More specifically, (you'll notice I have talked nothing of the plot or actual events in the movie, only the lasting appeal and general impact it had upon me. Take notice other critics, and stop ruining the movie for those who haven't seen it) The Matrix Reloaded ends in such a way that The Matrix Revolutions necessarily will start right away with no introduction whatsoever. Therefore, the sequels are moreso just one movie that was split into two to convenience viewers who don't have time to watch a four to five hour movie. Beyond that, this was done with careful precision, and with good insight which prevented the movie from completely inundating the spectator with drama, emotion, storyline, and well, movie. They only set the third movie to be released six months later, so you won't be left hanging for too long. The worst part of The Matrix Reloaded is the wait for the sequel, so you have to thank them for doing what they could to attenuate the inherent problem with a trilogy--the second movie.
However, I feel that although I have gone through the two-part sequel concept a lot already, I can't convey its significance with only what I have said so far, so permit me to continue. This movie is remarkable in that it is taking a huge leap of faith by doing what no other successful movie has done, treat its sequels in a way that I can only describe as inseparably bounded. I may be wrong but I see significance in the way the sequels are being released; one just six months later seems a bit hasty, but only because I've never seen it before. It takes a first to make a second, so if this succeeds (I don't see how it will fail), this might mark the onset of a new moviemaking method for trilogies-connecting the two sequels to each other as a purposefully split sequel, released as two only months apart to create the kind of cliffhanging affect that soap operas or tv shows have on the viewer. Believe me, this is no Back to the Future ""To Be Continued"" type of connection, this is one such that the second movie leaves you with the gut feeling that the third is a continuation of the second, not another sequel of the first that just happens to have enough of the nostalgia to be successful without becoming tiresome. This movie spurs a psychological attachment yielding desire, pure and raw. I want nothing more than to see the conclusion of this trilogy. If I had to pass over 100 movies to see it I would in a second flat, and not because the film is so indescribably masterful, but because the ending gently and raptly swept me into the path of the next movie, which I know is coming in a short time. There is no conclusion because there doesn't have to be one, I know the movie is coming and I know when. And I know now that it will be as astounding as the first two and more. Keep this in mind when you watch the movie, over and over again. Maybe I'll see you in the theatres, smiling.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

When it comes to sequels though, they are generally meant for one thing, making more money. In the case of Reloaded though, it decides to focus on the action at the cost of storyline. In the first one the story is set up, and in this one, it continues, which is what the sequel is all about. Starting off with an amazing shootout to the very questioning cliffhanger (i particualy enjoyed that) this film is defenatly the best film that i have seen all year. A lot of people were expecting some sort of revelation of this film which i think is unrealistic, as a movie is only to entertain you for its lenght, something that this film does very spectacularly! The only two things that i didnt think fit in there was the 'get your groove on' at the temple and also the score in a few places (it just didnt fit in the scenes as it should have). All in all though, this film is great, and i suggest you see it with the mindset of just having a good time, its really worth it!9/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The explosions look cooler, the fight scenes are more amazing, and the characters laugh louder in the face of gravity and all laws of physics.While if you take a step back and actually look at it, most of it is pretty ridiculous, but no more so than many other  movies. You have to just relax, don't think too much, and get lost in the matrix.

""Reloaded"" was a nasty surprise that utterly abandons those strengths in favor of unending Kung Fu Boogaloos, rancid baloney dialogue and hilarious fight scenes that never seem to end. A very good cast is suffers through some of the most trite language ever committed to film. The action scenes are comical and stretch all boundaries of patience past the breaking point. If you hated ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" you'll hate this (as I did). Think of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" as a template for the fight scenes - then extend the fight scenes to eternity and sprinkle in occasional Three Stooges-style gimmicks (as in Neo's battle with the hundreds of Agent Smiths). ""Reloaded"" may have been intended as a cheap satire of the original, or it may indicate an utter lack of inspiration on the part of the film makers who decided to make a sequel. Otherwise, it's suitable only as pre-teen/early adolescent entertainment.

I for one the movie was pretty sweet if not perfect.First of all let me point out that reloaded cannot touch the first part... because honestly watching bullet time for the first time is always going to be more memorable than the second... thats the magic of the unknown that a sequel cant bring back..But reloaded does jack, up the visuals to a whole new level... trust me... it will make anyone who loved part one want to watch it again.. some of the scenes are just mind boggling.For those who complain that the movie has no story, i will have to disagree. The film most definitely has one. Is it a bit confusing.. to get first time around ..maybe.. but avoid surface issues and look deeper and there is a very good sci fi story lined with tons of philosophy.My only request is dont have such high expectations that you disappoint youself.. the movie is good... its damn good.. let it be good. Dont ask(like many have done) why neo doesnt fly all the time, why does he bother to fight... i mean cmon guys.. thats like asking why does james bond always escape, how does bruce willis make it alive in die hard or why does the hero always win in a movie...Bottom line, enjoy reloaded, its gonna be.. one of the best movies.. u will see this summer.. and save.. some of ur thoughts.. for revolutions.. things will probably make a lot more sense after that.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first time I saw it I was semi-disappointed and the second I was in awe.  I began to appreciate the amazing special effects and the plot line, that although at first hard to distinguish, which was the real core of the story. I also got to see the preview for the Matrix Revolutions and nearly peed my pants out of excitement.  I feel that although I still think the Matrix was better that this one was a pretty good sequel. Keanu Reeves, although he never says that many lines, seems to have his acting and body emotions down better and is good throughout the film.  The little characters add to the plot line and excitement.  My favorites are the Keymaker, Persephone, the twins, and the Merovingian.  I feel all in all this movie did a pretty good job, especially with the success of the first one.  I recommend that anyone who was disappointed go see it for a second time round.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The amount of detail and thought that was put into it is astounding...The supernatural as poorly behaved programs? The visual representation of a multiverse concept in the Architect's room? The huge number of references to religion and mythology (e.g Trinity, Persephone, Nebuchadnezzar, etc, etc, etc)? The classic literature parallels to Orwell, Rand, and even Shakespeare? The virus-based (or multithread-based) replication of Agent Smith?  How good IS Hugo Weaving?  I think Smith is probably one of the best villains since Hannibal Lecter... and the movie isn't even based on him. Amazing. The concept of the matrix as an onion?  How many levels will there be? The perfect clash between the raw and virulent lust for love and life in Zion vs. the green-hued, sanitized, no emotion Matrix world? I could go on and on and on.  There are so many concepts to hash out, so many covert points to dwell on, so much that I will probably have to buy the DVD and watch it about 6-8 times before I can even get a grasp on some of it.Plus, the CG, although not perfect (will they ever be?), are so good that they can't be justly compared to anything out there currently.I am awestruck.  One of the best movies of our time.  The Wachowski brothers are geniuses.

First of all, what's with the whole, indian theme?! One second it's too ancient, the next it's too much like Star Trek!The only charater I accually like in this movie was Morphius. He's good as always.Being only 16 years old, I think it's just disgusting for all those sex scenes. I mean, the first film was great, but this is soooo stupid. There's too much there in those scenes, and too much missing from the rest of the movie.2nd, Trinity, seems somewhat overused in this movie. Warn out, one might say. The camera shots were really awful, and the effects looked no where near good, and even the music sounded cheap.All in all, they could've just left us with the first one. It told me enough, and in my mind, they beat Mr. Smith, and the Matrix.
I found this movie so bad I never finished watching it. A waste of my money, and all the copies of this movie should be burned.

There is too much information to be absorbed in one viewing. If you watch it twice and still don't like it I'm sorry for you. There is a lot of film to enjoy in the Matrix Reloaded, as they say ""something for everyone"". The Wachowski's are true visionaries of cinema. No matter what critics say the fact is they brought what would have been another cult classic sci-fi flick to a much larger audience than anyone ever could have expected. My belief is that a film's greatness is in what you get out it and how much there is to be gotten. A good film should be more enjoyable the second time you watch it and you should see more details and plot points you didn't notice at first, you should be able to pick out new tidbits on subsequent viewings little things you never saw before. A great film is and should be loaded with information and detail. The Matrix Reloaded is most definitely one of those films; it is far more enjoyable the second time around there is so much more to this film than is readily apparent. I love movies that can be enjoyed again and again and get better with time, every time I watch the original Star Wars I see tiny details I never noticed before small lines of dialogue that slip by unnoticed or an odd alien lurking in the background, every time I watch The Emperor's New Groove, Disney's outrageous comedy I laugh harder than I did the first time, the jokes are just so good that you can't help but smile or bust out laughing every time. If I'm right and that is an accurate measure of a film's quality than the Matrix Reloaded is a classic and everyone should go see it one more time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'm not fanatical (I didn't go out to watch it the night of 5/14), but went out of my way to watch it late tonight because it was sold out again here.After seeing this movie for the first time, all I could think was, ""It's beautiful"".  Not just the CG or the choreography, but the continuation of the story, the acting, and the philosophy.  If you have realistic expectations and are reasonablyintelligent, it's easy to see value in every minute of this movie.  There's a lot packed into this movie, and to me definitely some surprises.  This movie brings more realism to the Matrix world and less of the predictable comic-bookness of the first movie.It gives us a lot more to think about until the next and/or last installment.  In a nutshell:-- The effects were everything they were cracked up to be, but maybe notperfect.-- The acting was as good, if not better, than the first movie.  The characters were filled out more, and I have more sympathy for them.-- Be prepared for a little more talking and a little less action, but it's worth it if you listen.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

While 'the question', what is the Matrix, drove the first movie, Neo's continued ascent as a super-hero in the 'Matrix Reloaded'.  His struggles to comprehend what he must do now mirrors his struggle to accept his new reality in the first installment.The movie is well-worth the price of admission.  The effects are state-of-the-art, the action is breath-taking, the cinematography exhilarating.  The story moves long in comic-book fashion (quite by design), punctuated by awe-inspiring action scenes unlike anything ever put to film. Instead of a major revelation, like learning what the Matrix is, you are treated to several smaller, but just as important, ones.The only complaint I have is that the end of Reloaded seems a bit, well, jumpy.  It's almost like they decided they had to cut some time out of the movie. Still, this is a minor complaint and doesn't detract from the viseral impact of the film.  Go see it, and expect to want to see it again.  I saw it best put that this is truely a continuation of the first film, no better, no worse, but technically superior.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is not worse than the first, it is in fact a whole lot better.The acting may be a bit worse, but since it is a movie featuring Keanu Reeves, you learn not to expect too much. The Matrix: Reloaded is a much more complete movie than the original Matrix. Coupled with the short stories called Animatrix, you get a good picture of the world of tomorrow. This installment of the Matrix goes much further than the first one, exploring new paths of the philosophy of being human (and what that means).I really liked the idea of exiled programs and their plight as it somehow showed that while the machines are artificial constructs they still follow a basic pattern of evolution. I also liked the fact that the machines don't ""feel"" like humans do, even the Oracle and the Keymaker programs didn't feel as much as followed a path of selfprogramming that led them to their choices.As for the 10 minutes dance/sex-scene: it is meant as a metaphor (if you can call it that) showing the difference between the humans who are soft, organic and basically ruled by original instinct and the cold, calculating and unfeeling machines.And a note on the special effects and the Fight Scenes: nothing short of spectacular. The 18 minutes car chase left me breathless and with a small smile of satisfaction upon my lips. Damn! that was simply the most amazing thing I've ever seen on film.I loved this movie, even more than than the first. The original Matrix was revolutionary with its stunning special effects and laid a good basis for a trilogy, but Matrix: Reloaded really made me feel for this universe.

C'mon, everyone, start using your brains!  This isn't just a nice, pretty action movie like the original Matrix could have been.  This is the second part in a trilogy.  Just like the original Star Wars trilogy, this trilogy cannot survive on just the first movie alone. I won't deny that the Matrix was an awesome movie--I still rank it one of the best, but I know that the Brothers have a lot more planned for this trilogy than just that one movie.  These movies are designed to make you THINK, and I hope you do that as you watch this movie, because the plot line takes some interesting twists and turns that will leave you all surprised and amazed.On that note, let me say this--I believe this film had an AWESOME plotline. It made me think when I left the theater, and I am still thinking 24 hours after having seen it!  I won't reveal anything, but the plot is sound--it builds a good bridge, and I expect the third will be kickass!  I thought that the acting was great--we get to see more of our favorite characters, not just the awesome fx fight scenes. I don't have to say anything about the fx.  It says enough for itself. =)  Soundtrack is quite solid, like the first, with help from P.O.D, Manson, Paul Oakenfold, and, of course, Rage, to set the proper tone for this movie.Now, putting all the pieces together, I see this as a great movie when watched after the original Matrix.  I suggest that you watch the first one before seeing the second one--you'll understand things a whole lot better. If nothing else, when the Brothers finish this thing in November, I expect it to be one of the best trilogies out there, on par or better than LotR, Star Wars, and any other trilogies sitting out there (not many left to name, really).Ranked 11/10 (if such a rating existed =) )","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This was a fantastic film. While not exactly original, it was beautifully presented, fast-paced, well-written and excellently co-ordinated, proving to be one of the most successful science fiction movies of the decade. Four (five?) years later, they decided to snap up a quick million or two by extending the Matrix story into a trilogy. Financially advisable. Artistically? Possibly one of the worst courses of action it's possible to take.THE MATRIX RELOADED is a shameless spin off of the first movie, an ill-conceived, atrociously-written, poorly-executed piece of cinematic sewage. It doesn't matter how many bucks this is worth, or how fast the fight scenes are, or how cool the computer graphics are - I have yet to hear any convincing argument to defend this pathetic film. It's unoriginal, protracted, convoluted, confused, brainless garbage.More than anything else, it's excruciatingly boring. Close to four-fifths of the film is devoted to Neo and his buddies engaged in glorified punch-ups, firefights, car chases and mind-power duels with his foes. All of these run for an average fifteen minutes, enough time to send you into a stupor with the unimaginative, repetitive action and clumsy cinematography. Furthermore, the acting certainly can't save this turkey - all of the characters, even the human ones, behave more like robots than human beings, hamming their way through the interminable jiujitsu sequences as if they themselves are bored by their actions.But wait! There's more! In a feeble attempt to justify the inane combat, the Wachowskis have stuffed the film with ""philosophic content"". This is too insipid to be described even as chicken-soup philosophy, sounding more like the confused, monotonous, rudimentary existentialist ramblings of an egocentric thirteen-year-old. Rather than writing these ideas into the plot, they have simply bundled them together in incoherent clumps and stuffed them at random intervals into the screenplay, resulting in unintelligent, meandering dialogue throughout. Not only does this suggest that the Wachowskis don't quite understand their own ""philosophy"", and may have lifted it from a story written by a dim-witted teenage nerd, but it demonstrates their lack of basic story-writing skills - not a good sign for moviemakers, or this movie.So there you have it - your latest serving of half-baked, money-grubbing commercial swill. A filthy insult to the original film. 1/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

There were amazing action scenes in it and incredibly fantastic special effects. The story line wasn't as straight forward as the first one probably because it needs to fill in details so that the final edition of the trilogy is understandable.
There are funny moments (the French guy is a joker) and sad moments (key maker man).Concluding, it is an awesome film and I totally recommend it!
:: However, I do suggest that you view the original film if you have forgotten key parts because there is no summary or *previously on the Matrix* at the beginning of the film. You will waste your money if you have forgotten what has happened and the current situation.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

On first pass, (ie, having seen it only once), it surpasses its predecessor in terms of action, suspense, surprise, intrigue, martial arts, romance, character conflict and character depth, special effects, and surprisingly, philosophical wisdom. My only critique to date is that the integration of music and action was not as distinct or as brilliant as in the first film.
I will take brief note of the special effects. They creep up on you like a cat stalking its prey. Early on one finds the movie a bit typical of your medium-budget, mid-1990's sci-fi film. The action scenes at first are intense, but hardly spectacular, when compared to the film's predecessor. But as the action heats up, so do the special effects. For instance, it is not till the fourth fight scene in the film that we see Neo fight his old nemesis, Mr. Smith. At first, the fight seems ordinary. Then it seems rather unique in that Mr. Smith has multiplied. But by the time Neo fights the Mr. Smiths using a sign pole, you cannot help but wonder what it is you are actually watching.  And in the 'chase scene', as the camera zooms and pans all around the characters, while standing on a tractor-tailer moving at 60mph, one cannot help but wonder, what is this?
Most critics and critiques I have read dismiss the movie as your typical action/special-effects film. Or they ridicule the film for lacking the mystique and wonder of the first. But as you watch it, pay special attention to the dialogues of control/dependency, of control/volition, of free-will/determinism. Likewise, in first film, we saw philosophical juxtapositions of realism vs. solipsism, of states of consciousness, of creating and controlling your reality. Philosophical themes have definitely not vanished or minimized in the film; far from it, these themes have been replaced by even more thought-provoking questions with even more potency.
The mystique of the first film may have left mass audiences feeling in awe. But to us hard-core sci-fi/mind-bender fans, The Matrix felt flat and undernourished in its presentation and revelation of the real fabric of its universe. Why? Well, that presentation concludes well within the first half of the film, unlike the films' forefathers like Blade Runner, Total Recall, or contemporaries such as eXistenZ, the Thirteenth Floor, in which 'reality' is not revealed until near the very end (or at all). Matrix Reloaded, however, reintroduces that mystique . By cleverly layering philosophical dialogue into characters' motivations, we discover the 'Matrix' is not all we thought it was: it is in fact, much more. Our heroes' Matrix is designed precisely such that 99% of its inhabitants our happy with the 'choice' of living within it, but the remaining 1% feel the need to control their fate, a fate that is itself contained within a simulation. Whereas Matrix closed Pandora's Box in Act 1 of the trilogy, Act 2 -- Matrix Reloaded  -- reopens that Box, and will have us guessing well into November.
And with any luck, we'll be guessing beyond that.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Some scenes had the audience cheering. I heard a few oohs and aahs and lots of chuckles.This one builds on the original's story and effects. Absorbing story for those who like cerebral sci-fi, with riveting action and a new high for digital effects.The story is turning out to be even more clever than in the first movie. The events of the previous movie were not forgotten, including Neo's new superpowers, and his status in the ""real"" world. I wondered how they could create conflict in the Matrix now that Neo is a God there. They found ways! Most of the action is still in the Matrix.Some of the exposition went on too long, but there was a lot of story to relate. Fortunately they told most of it in snappy dialogue, and bracketed it between action sequences that will leave you breathless.They brought back Hugo Weaving in a believable way, and gave his character a twist. I'm glad, since his character and performance was a highlight for me in the first movie, and in this one. There are interesting new villains too.Some of the fight sequences went on too long. Some places started to feel like a Jackie Chan movie. They are exciting though, and always fit the scene and serve a purpose. They used less wire work, which I appreciated. Wire work has been everywhere since Crouching Tiger and it's really getting overdone.The ending was delightfully ambiguous. Did Neo do that, or was he trying to do something else and the other party interefered?A worthy sequel. I'm now even more interested in how this story is going to end.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I will go see the movie again with my wife, but not the kids.  This is not Star Wars or Star Trek.  This is not a family movie, but one for the adult sci-fi fan. There are a number of sexual innuendo's that would be too much for my children...Don't read on if you don't want to know about the movie.1.  A reference to a man cheating on his wife.  When the wife says you still have her lipstick on, he rubs his lips and says he doesn't have any on. She says ""She didn't kiss your lips.""2.  Another is a steamy sex scene between Neo and trinity.  Although no pertinent body parts are exposed during that scene, it is quite erotic and lasts longer than one would want it to if they had their kids.  On top of that, during that scene, they flip back and forth to a party and nipples are seen through the crowd.3.  A scene involving a piece of cake gets a woman to 'come' just by eating the cake.  There is a five minute explanation as to why that happened, as well as a cartoonish image of her 'exploding'.4.  Neo is forced to kiss another woman in order to be brought to the 'key maker'.  Personally, this movie could have done without this part, but felt compelled to throw it in anyway.  And it had nothing to do with anything.Aside from that, this is an excellent movie.  Great visual effects and a superb sound track.  I can't wait to see the next installment.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The action scenes are still good but the philosophical talks are as pretentious and annoying as ever. Some of them don't even make any sense. And the scene where Thomas Anderson/Neo (Keanu Reeves) talks with the architect (Helmut Bakaitis) is just as boring and nonsensical as everyone makes it out to be.

Luckily Matrix Reloaded fills that void with a well thought up script, and a neat idea translated into a simple good action film.Matrix Re-Loaded works, because it uses some simple action cliches but doesn't rely on the action to drive the story, it is the intriguing concept of ""the matrix"" and its inhabitants that make the film enjoyable.  But even more so the story gives us an opportunity to witness things that we can deem plausable and believable in an action film.  These concepts might I add are done very well like dodging bullets, scary villans, realistic fights, and a GREAT car freeway chase.Nobody is a real thespian in the film, but it doesn't matter, since the most interesting thing is ""the matrix"" itself.

After watching the 2-hour long visual wonder from the Wachowskis one must admit that. Yes, the story was too wandering, loosely binding some solitary self-sufficient action sequences; the lead actors did not seem quite well; the screenplay is not as well as the first one -- everything is true. But what about the ultimate visual experience that the Brothers offered? What about the enormous set decoration? What about the dazzling background music and soundtrack? And lastly, what about the never-seen-before adrenaline-soaked non-stop action? Tell me, how can you deny them?The film opens abruptly, ends abruptly, clearly pointing out that it's just a second movie of a trilogy. The much-hyped Zion makes its screen debut here finally and extremely well designed... the cave especially, where a drop-dead dance scene is shot with some fine piece of world music. The sex scene between Neo and Trinity was interesting to watch. There he, soft and fragile like a girl, and she, hard and strong like a guy, did make an unusual couple. I wish there was no romantic interest between them, because it looked so odd. The fight scene between Neo and numerous Agent Smiths was magnificient. Hugo Weaving reprised his much famous role, though without consequence, but brilliantly. The sequence was so well shot and Keanu Reeves was looking so beautiful with that long suit that sometimes it seemed Neo is directing some orchestra, the Smiths being the players. It's naturally one of the top three attractions of the movie. As the second comes the motorcycle run by Trinity with the keymaker. I stared holding my breathe, open-mouthed, when she started in the opposite direction.As I said earlier, performance of the lead actors could not impress me. This time Keanu Reeves looked too mechanical, like a robot with a sunglass. But maybe it's not his fault. The role was that... playing god, virtually. Carrie Anne-Moss... probably the most unattractive heroine treated so lovingly by an attractive hero, was quite plain. Fishburne looked good during the speech, but otherwise unimpressive. The new casts were rather good. Along with Niobe, the Twins, the Councillor, it's totally thumbs up for Persephone. According to my thinking, Monica Bellucci, though in her short role, is the third most attractive feature of the film. Her appearence, as well as delivery of speech, is truly wonderful. I hope she will get a bigger role in Revolutions.The story is rather complex, or in fact, there could be no story at all. The very concept of the keymaker is just to introduce two super action sequences I believe. In that sense Reloaded is just a trailer for the Revolutions. But it's sheer entertainment, there's no question about that. 8/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie is indeed full of action, and the special effects are amazing.  The story line continues to twist, and makes you question the reality Neo lives in.  Just as with the first Matrix, I am going to have to go back a few more times to catch things that I missed. My only disappointment was with some of the CGI.  You can visibly tell when it switches from live action Neo to computer Neo.  The biggest giveaway to me was his trench coat.  It would suddenly have a flat black color to it, instead of the natural color of real fabric.

Blown over and head-spiked by its action, I was enthralled. Later on, I didn't understand why many people were trashing the film. (It was, in the balance, positively viewed and critiqued; just much less so compared to the original film). The fights with Agent Smith are electrically charged, with almost shocking originality. Once again, they were riding the currents that LED them to completely original filming and effects. Some car chases are formulaic, and thus, boring. Not a problem: The car chase in TM*RLD is one of the best ever done. Is there another film where somebody takes on an SUV with a sword? Even for bad$$, That's #insanely#BadA$$#!The Peevish Merovingian delighted me, as did his crew of thugs, particularly the Albino Twins. The fight with those guys, on the double staircases with weapon laden walls, is also one of the greats, even though it feels a little pageant-ish, or dancey. The Key Maker is an innovative concept. They should have kept him.The human world expands in TM*RLD. We meet other crews on other ships. Zion was more organized and populous then I'd imagined. The typical politics (pride infested people clawing at more relevance and power, gradually blinding themselves to all that is good and worthy) should not have surprised me. It certainly wouldn't now. Good stories are always about, as Game Of Thrones author, GRRM, put it: ""The human heart in conflict with itself."" All the rest is a backdrop. In TM flicks, what a backdrop!The pre-ending, inside the architect's space, felt like something out of a futuristic 70's/80's feature, so I connected to it. Apparently, many viewers did not. The plot direction at the very end, pertaining to Bane and Agent Smith, as well as Neo & The Sentinels, eluded me, as did the philosophical message. I won't claim to have a handle on them now. I'll have to read up on it prior to reviewing Revelations. No need to get into it at this time.What we will jump into now is a small sample of the problems. (I won't pretend to be capable of high level analysis. This is just some simple broad strokes). Apparently, the Wachowskis didn't plan TM as a trilogy, but the overwhelming success of TM ushered it in. While they incorporated all of their signature thrills, the SS (Sequel Sickness) infected the script as badly as Agent Smith infected The Matrix. The sickness reaches its high thermometer mark in TM*REV, with Resurrections still an unseen ? For this writer.TM*RLD is more like an ensemble piece, or a series of vignettes, rather than a cohesive whole. Some of these vignettes are bad code, as they dead-end with no plot advancement: Neo gets stuck in the subway.... Why? Who knows. There's a husband, wife, and little girl that are programs, and Neo works to save them. Why? If they were Matrix trapped humans, it would have worked better, particularly with respect to the little girl. There are simply too many head-scratchers in the movie.People hate the scene in which the Merovingian's wife wants Neo to kiss her, but we can chalk that up to an AI training session for a program. If it had been framed that way, it would have transformed the scene from sappy to clever. While viewers seem starkly sliced apart by the orgasm cake, I am decidedly in the middle about it. I must say, the commercial ramifications of such a dessert are staggering, though, aren't they? No doubt, nerds are working feverishly on developing such sorts of programming as your read this. Just imagine THAT with your after dinner coffee.... In the words and voice of Meg Ryan's Sally: ""yes, Yes, YES!"", indeed.Regardless of its substandard algorithms, Reloaded is still exceptional, and a top-tier action/sci-fi thriller. The plot is not as tightly contained and directional, compared to the original, but it still puts the characters and story ahead of the action. They might shoot more bullets than the entire Rambo franchise, but they spend a lot less time shooting, and a lot more time electrifying the viewer.To cap off the wiring, and at the same time, presuppose that viewers who only like biopics or Hallmark movies won't be tuning in, the majority of watchers will be thrilled with TM*RLD. Anyone with a high IQ may find it simplistic and muddled, while ones with lower IQs may find it unworkably confusing. Cinephiles may overheat and shut down due to script, logic, and other such damage it took on, in the wake of the magnificence of the first film. The reaction for low-fantasy-capacitied Only-Realism-Literates would be all-the-above. The rest of us Action/Sci-fi fans should love it. I do.Once again, this Matrix still ROX. It's 100% unplug & tune-in, blue pill worthy.IMHO...

The first film had lots of action (gunfire, kung fu, etc.) and a simple story that kept you thinking but not debating during the film.  Reloaded was too confusing to make since of all the action.The film had elements of Superman films, Star Trek films, the first Ghostbusters, and the Tomb Raider video games.  Neo had to do this in order to open that, which would allow him to enter this and find out that, all the while ""up, up and awaying"" when a fight gets too tough.  The space ships were like watching the Enterprise and Voyager take on Klingon Bird of Preys. Where were all these ships in the first one when Morpheus first found Neo? You think that the prophecy would mean as much to them as it means to Morpheus.The effects were nice but everything looked like CGI so it was hard to tell when the acting ended and the special effects began.  To many camera angles and slow-mo's made me dizzy at times.All in all, Revolutions better have a lot of answers or this will be remembered as the most expensive ""Wrath Of Khan"" ever.  After this, Joel Silver will need another teaming of Riggs and Murtaugh to keep his fans interested.  2 1/2 stars out of 4.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, for those lucky brainies, it signifies a revolution in filming. Never-seen-before action sequences, witty dialogues, smart acting, neo-modern concepts human race from extermination by 'intelligent' machines. The film is shot for the major part in Zion - the last outpost of 'rebel' humans. Agent Smith gives a new dimension to villainry with his power-packed role. Then you have a host of other interesting characters like the Merovingian, The Keymaker, Commander Lock, councilor Harmann, Captain Niobe, and other. the plot is of course ridiculously complex and the last part featuring the Architect requires every bit of concentration.ACTING: Kianu Reeves effortlessly plays the role of Neo - The One and redeems himself after a spate of not-so-good movies. Carries Anne-Moss as Trinity, and now Neo's love interest has got a good share of role. Fishborne as Morpheous is acceptable. But kudos to the villain pair of Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and Merovingian (Lambert Wilson). Be it their imposing screen presence, or their timely delivery of memorable dialogs, they are just perfect in their roles. And of course, you have the mouth-watering Monica Belluci, widely acknowledged to be one of the prettiest women in the world, essaying the role of Persephone and involved in an intimate smooch-scene with Neo. Go ahead grab your tryst with the Matrix.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

At the time that Neo, Morpheus and Trinity went back together inside the Matrix, the whole thing turned from a borefest into something totally magnificent.The car chase is cinematic history on its own and the visual effects of the whole movie make 'Attack of the clones' look like Frogger. The story is great too, again only for the 2nd half of the movie. There's a twist in the end, where all rules seem to turn upside down, but you should watch the movie to see for yourselves.The first half is boring, meaningless and makes you think that the brothers have started to believe in their own myth, just like George Lucas did. The events in Zyon are meaningless and the sets look like a cross between the Black Panther offices and Battlestar Galactica. They should really reconsider that first part.Anyway, watching 'The Matrix Reloaded' till the end, makes you forget about the rather meaningless introduction and you leave the movie wanting more.8/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Directed by the Wachowskis, the film takes bold strides in both narrative and action, attempting to deepen the philosophical underpinnings while delivering even more ambitious set pieces.Visually, Reloaded is a spectacle that pushes the boundaries of what was previously thought possible in action cinema. The Wachowskis, along with their visionary cinematographer Bill Pope, continue to innovate with breathtaking sequences, including the iconic highway chase and the intricate choreography of the Burly Brawl. The film builds upon the original's bullet time with even more sophisticated techniques, solidifying its status as a visual pioneer.Keanu Reeves reprises his role as Neo, and his portrayal continues to be a compelling anchor for the story. The character's evolution takes center stage as Neo grapples with the extent of his powers and the responsibilities that come with them. The supporting cast, including Laurence Fishburne and Carrie-Anne Moss, remains strong, contributing to the film's overall narrative depth.While Reloaded delves deeper into the philosophical questions introduced in The Matrix, including fate, choice, and the nature of control, it also introduces new layers of complexity. The Architect's discourse on the cyclical nature of the Matrix and the role of The One adds an intriguing dimension to the story, but it also challenges the audience with its abstract concepts.The film's pacing, however, is a point of contention for some viewers. The intricate plot, heavy with exposition and philosophical dialogue, can be demanding, and the film's place as the middle installment in a trilogy leaves some storylines unresolved, contributing to a sense of narrative incompleteness.Don Davis returns to compose the score, maintaining the electronic and industrial soundscape established in the first film. The music complements the film's tone and enhances key moments, though it may not reach the iconic heights of the original's soundtrack.In conclusion, The Matrix Reloaded is a visually stunning and ambitious sequel that attempts to deepen the narrative and philosophical themes of its predecessor. While it doesn't replicate the groundbreaking impact of the first film, it remains a noteworthy chapter in the Matrix saga, pushing the boundaries of action filmmaking and challenging audiences with its intricate storytelling and philosophical musings.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Maybe I was expecting something different the first time. But for some reason I walked away with mixed feelings. I decided to hold off my review until I viewed the movie once more, this time knowing what to expect. And so, after the second viewing, I am ready to give *my* opinion on ""The Matrix Reloaded"". The movie in all aspects is a masterfully crafted work of profound fiction. This movie is like an onion upon viewing it multiple times (I apologize for the poor cliche). Each time you see the movie, you pick up things possibly missed; peeling layers off, so to speak. The Mythical and Biblical undertones that are often overlooked are delightfully refreshing in this era of Action films. I truly wish I could elaborate on the epiphanies I experienced whilst viewing ""The Matrix Reloaded"", but I would risk spoiling the plot. Therefore, I invite all of you to see this movie for the first or fortieth time, not just for the spectacular visuals, but for the story within a story. If you thought the tagline ""How far does the rabbit hole go?"" was used just because it sounded cool, well friends, you are sorely mistaken. The tagline should also have the ""American Beauty"" one.....""Look Closer""....","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But the real charm of these setpieces for action is how they keep us along for the story, and there is much story to be told.  The last scenes of the movie are rife with sharp dialogue and subtle hints at what is to come and what has gone before.  We go deeper into the rabbit hole even if it takes a virtuoso car chase to get us there.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

    The storyline is pretty intriguing and that's what captured my attention to the first one. Some of the supporting cast members almost had no impact to the story or movie whatsoever. For instance, Jada Pinkett Smith added absolutely NOTHING to this movie and I mean nothing. They should have left her out of it.   All in all, it's a decent sequel, but not quite what I was expecting. I will be seeing The Matrix: Revolutions in November, hopefully it will be better than Reloaded. Do I recommend seeing this movie? Well, not really. It's okay, but nothing what you'd expect. 2 *'s out of 4 *'s. Really disappointing","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Are you sure you understood the message here, or are you really part of the 99% who just think you can chose?I have been thinking, since I already have seen the movie three times now...What might it be that make all the mob to hate it? I finally came with an answer...all of them are part of a lesser mind, the kind needed to be controlled by a system, the same they need to be happy with such pieces of trash like X-men2. The main reason most people don´t like this excellent mind-bending, actions packed, adrenaline filled roller coaster is because...they do not understand it. And rather than accept it is far out of their league to get it, they chose to repel it. Shame on all of you.More than a review, this sounds like a manifesto against all the bad rep this movie is getting. But I believe it is a movie worth watching. It has nothing to do with hype and high expectations, it has more to do in how people do not fulfill the expectation of the movie towards them, but fear not...In time, this one will become the biggest cult sequel ever. Well, hoping minds are not lesser than these days.The so called ""poor plot"" is excellent, with an extreme finesse that it really becomes fragile and strong at the same time. The action sequences are top notch, and anyone complaining about the ""fake and obvious CGI""...let me tell you...Unless you are able to find, not just people who look alike..but people looking exactly the same as Hugo Weaving, train them to jump in the sky and make it look real, go ahead, be my guest, otherwise just zip it. The car chase scene became instantly in one of my all time favorite action scenes ever!!!All in all, an excellent movie that really deserves a better rep than it has, but don´t worry we are living now in the sixth version, maybe the next one will be filled with more people who like to think once in a while...to all of you, just rest, lay down, and go on with your life enjoying ""really"" empty stuff like your so beloved X-men2. Au revoir","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The action sequences are amazing, although at some points you can tell it's CGI, but still, it's much better than anything that's come out before this.  The kung-fu is top notch and is even more brilliant than the first movie. The plot and story are a little slower than the first, but it introduces us to more characters and reveals more about the Matrix.  You must see this movie more then once to take in all the complexity of it, and all the subtleties.  It is much more complex than the first movie, but that's even better.  And to all who don't know going in--Reloaded and Revolutions (the third movie) are really one big 5 hour movie cut in half, so each is about two and a half hours.  So don't be surprised at the end of this one.  All in all The Matrix Reloaded is a great second movie to lead us into the third movie of what is to be an amazing trilogy.  But, ""No one can be told what The Matrix is, you have to see it for yourself.""- The Matrix.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Now one thing i want to address is that in the sequel there is no bullettime now i know everyone uses it now but y not at least have one sequence wit it? NOW HERE COMES MY REVIEW!!!!1Now the plot of reloaded maked sence too me The Crew of the Nebakenezer tring to save zion from a certain fate and finally we get too see zion and an amazing car chase also new moves introduced in the fight scence's and best of yet Neo is getting stronger.Plot Score 8/10Special Effects:They were very good in this movie in the BUrly Brawl really the CGI Neo looked almost real.THe scenes with Neo flying show how much we can do now .Also the effects in the car chase were good but some of the cars u could tell were fake. Effects Score 9/10
Fight Sequences:4 WORDs WILL BLOW U AWAY.THats all i have to say
Fight Score: 10/10Overall:The Matrix Reloaded is a well made movie from my standpoint and revolutions should be even better i don't under stand why people are saying this movie sucks.Reloaded is prob one of if not the best sequel ever.So trust ur instinks and do what u wish.All i know is this thing is going to break records.

It was a nice continuation from the first one. The action sequences are A+ except for the part where Neo goes against like 100 agent smiths which you see in the trailers. I think that scene is a little corny, but it was all right. I think Zion was incredible and just the sheer size of it is overwhelming. I've only seen the movie once and a lot of the philosophy and explanations that they use in the movie are very tough to understand at first. At the end you're still trying to put together all the pieces of the puzzle. To get a real good understanding of the movie, probably should watch the movie atleast two or three times before giving an honest opinion about the movie. Definitely looking forward to number three. If you liked the first one, you'll probably like reloaded. Go and see it, and subject yourself to the mysterious work of art of the Wachoski Brothers.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was what you go to films on a Saturday Night like this for..entertainment, thrills and escape-ism!There have been allot of things said about ""Matrix Reloaded"", and I gotta tell ya, I am NOT going to put down or knock anyone's reviews of this....good or bad. I found this a thrill ride, and it met what I expected of it. Keanu was great, Carrie-Ann did her thing, Lawrence was still rough, ready and steadfast in his belief...and the new additions were entertaining. The movie went at a nice pace for me, I don't know what many are upset about. One thing that made me love this film to death was that I worked in a big-time computer company so as I watched this, I was entertained by this film..that is where my head was. A re-loaded program with a little bit more. Come on folks...it's not more than that and lives quite nicely to that expectation!!!Maybe I'm giving away the whole concept behind the film, or maybe I'm just relating this to my company's C++ and SQL Programming, the daily Microsoft monopoly screw we're all experiencing, the Apple Guys vs. The IBM guys and the two guys in my office who swear by Compaq or Gateway, the McAfee Guys and the Norton Utilities Guys, Firewalls, Hidden codes and hidden program designers, freelancers who know more than anyone, etc., etc...""The Matrix Reloaded"" is what I can relate to and loved every minute of it. And that ""ending"" thing....didn't bother me, I can't wait until November. (Here's something ELSE to consider...before most of us were born, many folks went to the movies and saw ""serials"". Many of those were Westerns and they ended with ""To be continued"" just to bring those theater patrons back to the movies the next week. Hey, maybe....this is a homage to that. If so, good for them!)So I say...take a chill pill. Either you ""get it"" or ya don't. Either you can relate it on a computer geek level or you just watch it for the kick-butt Karate scenes and special effects. Maybe that's not enough for ya. Maybe ya don't get the ""Zion"" thing, maybe ya do, maybe it's not important to you. But its ALL good. That is what films are out there to do and because we're all talking about it so much, it did what it was supposed to. I had a great time and I hope others will too. Grab some friends, go see ""Matrix Reloaded"", live it up. It's fun!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This led me to be both extremely excited as well as a little worried as the opening of Matrix Reloaded approached. Fortunately, I worried for nothing.  Matrix Reloaded has not only outdone the original - I believe it is competition for the Star Wars franchise as the greatest Science Fiction concept of all-time.  My experience in seeing this film in a packed theatre on opening day now rivals my first screenings of Star Wars: Phantom Menace and Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring.  I highly recommend this film for anyone interested in Science Fiction, philosophy, technology, or film in general.  It is without any doubt that the Matrix trilogy will be looked upon by film historians as one of the most influencial and important Science Fiction concepts of the 21st century.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I cannot describe how exhillarating the movie was except to say that I've never been so moved, so excited, so inspired by or so absorbed into a movie as I was with this one.But the movie itself was only part of the whole experience. The theater I went to had 8 showings at 10pm tonight, and 5 more at 11:30pm. We had tickets for a 10pm showing. We arrived at the movie theater an hour early...and were met with a throng of people in the form of a line that circled the movie theater and the shopping center that housed it THREE times. Everyone in that line had already purchased tickets, that was just the line to get into the theater. The line itself, we estimated, was over a mile long. And yet, for a crowd so large, it was all very orderly. The audience in the theater was the same way...people were excited, but not talking or shouting throughout the movie. We cheered and clapped and screamed and said ""Ow!"" and ""HOLY CRAP!"" in all the same places. All of that, in addition to the movie itself, made this the single most memorable movie event of my lifetime.I realize all of these things make me seem melodramatic and silly in the eyes of people who aren't fans of the film, and have no plans to see it. It probably even seems over the top for people who haven't seen the movie yet. But I can't help the truth of how this experience affected me. I will never forget this night at the movies.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The action scenes almost kick too much ass.  The special effects are totally flawless.  Altogether, the visuals of this movie are simply incredible.That said, there's too much philosophical fluff slowing it down.  It was smart of the Wachowski brothers to include all this meaningless mumbo-jumbo to keep their fans busy, but to the average movie lover, the dialogue is tiresome.The creators definitely bit off more than they can chew.  Way too many what-ifs were created in this movie, and the third Matrix will have to be quite the epic to successfully close the story. My expectations are so high, they're gonna have to summon a miracle to make me happy.The Matrix Reloaded was an entirely satisfying experience... I just have concerns about the ideas that were conjured up. This is a brilliantly made movie, but they went a little overkill on the pseudo-philosophy.  But then again, I guess that's what the Matrix is all about.  If for no other reason, see it for the all-GM car chase scene; it is the biggest rush you'll get from a film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Not only that but you get to see what being ""the one"" is really all about. As Neo can now do the things only hinted at in the first film. The action of course is first rate and more than tops the first film. Reloaded contains what is in my opinion the greatest chase sequence put to film. All the characters that lived through the first movie are back with the exception of Tank(and who cares about him?)which is always good for credibility.  With a influx of new and exciting characters, Neo as the one, smith upgraded, zion exposed, and new depths of mind blowing  action and thought Reloaded more than makes your film watching day.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Bullet-time looked cool in the first movie - so shoot 50% of the next movie in bullet-time. Add nonsensical pop philosophy - there is no choice, but everything has a cause - indeed!!! we need machines, and the machines need us ; some things never change, while some do - sounds like a high-school essayist on dope. Add to it anatomical anomalies such as the muscular brain [And I thought Smith was smart!]. There are sophisticated identification schemes - to ensure that Neo is the one, Seraph fights him - why not ask for a password? - especially when it is shown earlier that communication is encrypted via ssh ;-)The first movie was a fresh concept, and somewhat tastefully done. It had promised to be the Neuromancer of the movie world, taking sci-fi from the ""space, the final frontier"" to cyberspace. With this installment, it all seems like a whole lot of wasted talent.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

There is no doubt that the SFX are awesome and the fight scenes are dazzling but I just was not sure about the film as a whole. Although the production team has easily out done the previous film in terms of action, had they gone too far? There are parts of this where Neo does things not humanely possible and it is obvious that the character is computer graphics and not Keanu. Yet it entertains so should I moan.I watched it again because despite my feelings that it was inferior to the first I could not get it out of my head. There is a lot of dialogue that is just far too much to take in one go - this has led some critics to call it too philosophical. However when I watched it again just 3 days later I came out of the cinema fulfilled and desperate to see the next installment. You leave with so many questions and everything pieces together second time round. This is definitely another innovative film by the Wachowski brothers, I hear people criticise the film for going too far but that is the whole point of the plot- you have to take the Matrix as they describe it in the first film and this one. When out of the Matrix the characters are real and accessible. This will no doubt be categorised as unequal to the first as most sequels are but I would disagree, this film is the ultimate escape fantasy that deals with present and possible problems with a background of science fiction and action. Watch it twice and marvel at the genius!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie has awesome effects, it tries to be everything you want it to be, and there are still people walking out of it disappointed.  I don't understand this at all. What were you expecting?  The effects were fantastic, the story was mind-boggling and left you with more questions than the first movie did when you walked out.  I had a 15 minute conversation withthe people in front of me.  They think there is another level of the Matrix and we haven't even seen the real world at all in the first two movies.  My point...this movie is everything it should be.

There is more than enough action to suffice. I say Mind Candy in my review's title because it is such a wonderful story backing up the beautiful special effects and wonderful acting and action sequences. It's amazing that a sequel this huge can topple the original of it's saga. For those of you ( Which where I went to see it very few ) who stayed through all the credits ( which they were very long but necessary ) you and I were treated to the preview to the third installment of The Matrix Saga.

It is one of those sequels that comes close to the original, not only because it really is almost as good, but because you are overwhelmed by what you see on the screen. 'X2' did a pretty good job earlier this year and another good example is 'Terminator 2: Judgement Day'. Yes, the things you see on the screen...We left 'The Matrix' with Neo as The One, ready to start the war to free all human slaves. He has learned how to fly, which sounds a little stupid but is brought pretty convincing. He is having dreams about Trinity set in the future, where she is shot. Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and some new crew members arrive in Zion, the last human city. Morpheus has a speech there and after that they party. The party is the first great sequence. Sentinels are digging to Zion so things must be done. Morpheus thinks Neo is the answer but not everyone believes in the prophecy so there is some resistance. Neo has to see the Oracle to know more about what to chose, and there we see the second great sequence, probably the best action sequence I have ever seen. Updates of Agent Smith attack Neo and of course he fights back. I will not reveal more of the story but the last great sequence is a freeway chase, and that is probably the second best action sequence I have ever seen. Between those great sequences we have some scenes with action or romance, and some very funny moments as well. No, you will definitely not be bored once.If you only want to see sci-fi action 'The Matrix Reloaded' is as good as it gets. Personally I think it looks even better than 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers' and we know how that looked. Unfortunately I don't want only sci-fi action. Of course I enjoyed but sometimes the Wachowski Brothers take things a little too far. There is one scene in particular, you will know which one I mean. And although the story is good with a complicated one like this there have to be flaws and there are. It didn't bother much for me, but I can understand if it does for you.'The Matrix' was new on a lot of levels, unfortunately things can't be new twice. So 'The Matrix Reloaded' just uses the new things and multiply the action by ten, and it works for most part. One last thing. It is always said that the writers meant it to be a trilogy. 'The Matrix' ends and if there is a sequel or not, you can feel satisfied as a watcher because the film has a real ending. To me it seemed a little that it was not sure if those sequels would ever be made. 'The Matrix Reloaded' has sequel written all over it and so it ends without a real ending. Again, it didn't bother me much but those are little things.'The Matrix Reloaded' as just eye candy and sci-fi adventure is better than the original. As you watch it for the whole movie it comes close but then the original is better. Anyway, if you liked the first you will enjoy this one as well.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

A raving orgy cult with a handful of improbably cool headed, almost noble people on top.So much, so, soooo silly robotic hardware shown in the real world, it would have been infinitely more believable if there was just the Matrix and its super computer, hidden, somewhere... if i want robots actively taking over i watch a Terminator film, the Matrix should be its very own thing strictly handled inside a simulation.The tsunami of Smith's, ugh, clearly, a first of its kind in movie history, but... what's the point of it all, again?Some of these music choices, ouch. And everything is so damn loud, but the talking is this whispery nothing, volume is at 11 already, sound effects blow my head clean off but i still can't understand a ton of dialog.I absolutely had to laugh at the very end scene, with the Smith infested survivor, whose face we only saw for like a weak minute, is now panned onto screen, upside-down. If an overly dramatic ""dam dam daaaam"" cue wasn't present, i might have missed who that is supposed to be.Incredibly padded movie with mindless action imbetween the couple noteworthy parts are the Oracle, Architect... almost the French dude... and that's about it.To be honest Neo's ""Superman thing"" (yes, it is actually called this in the movie) at the very end of the first already got me worried, but i shook it off as the movie just ended. Who would have thought sequels r'a comin' with more or less Neo flying around all the freakin' time. Wuff...","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Matrix Fans!!  This is lookin' to be the BEST sci-fi Trilogy EVER!!  Enjoy:First of all, NOBODY could have done a better job than the Wachowski Bros. directing, writing the script, film editing, etc.  NOBODY!! Congratulations to them and rest of production crew for a job WELL DONE!
Why this film could NEVER have been better?  Simply the BEST?  Tons of reasons.  I'll list a few right now.  #1) BEST ACTION - Martial arts choreography, the sequences were masterpieces.  Bruce who?  Neo looked soo good executing sweet, graceful martial arts moves.  Freeway scene, 100 Smiths, etc.  Simply the BEST!  #2)  BEST CGI - Could NEVER have been better.  I DARE other film makers to beat The Matrix and Reloaded's sophisticated Action and CGI.  Awesome display and Simply UNBEATABLE!  The best the other lowly producers can do is COPYCAT.  #3) FABULOUS ACTING - Hugo Weaving, don't need to write much about him, the World knows he's the best film villain of all time.  Keanu's acting getting better and better, the beautiful Carrie-Ann, Fishburne, etc.  The Best.  #4) PHILOSOPHY - Logic, Ethics, Metaphysics, Epistemology, Christianity, it's all there, pay attention, look it up.  You'll learn a few things.  #5) FASHION SENSE - Heroes and Villains could NEVER have looked more Cool than what we have seen in the Matrix Trilogy.  NEVER.  Neo made Superguy look like a Fag.  The women were SEXY too!  This movie was flat-out SEXY.  #6) LOVE - We ALL know Love Conquers All.  Enough said.  #7) SOUND and MUSIC - Another Oscar for the talented sound effects editors.  Awesome groups in the Soundtrack. #8) BEST DIRECTING - Wachowski bros.  Enough said.  And Last (for now).  #9) CONCEPT - NO ONE, and I mean NOBODY in this Universe will EVER take away The Matrix CONCEPT.  And NO, I NEVER want to hear about Dim-Witted films that share an inkling of the same Matrix Concept.  The World checked up on those films.  Charlie's Skanky Angels is on top of the COPYCAT list.  The Matrix did it FIRST, did it BIGGER and did it ALOT BETTER.  I can understand the Wachowskis' IRRITATION.  Job WELL DONE in Reloaded.  No other film will EVER Top it.  Congrats again to the W-bros. for Originality.  I can go on and on, blah, blah, blah, but I'll stop here for now.  Enough can Never be said.I'll say this again and again.  NEO (Our New Hero) has made Supergay, well...look pretty and Gay.  He ain't in No Faggety tight blue suit.  Neo Sky-Rockets with shades, now THAT'S how you fly!!  It's ALL about the Black Trench and Shades baby!!  It's a bird!  It's a plane!  It's.Super Who?? NO! It's NEO!!  The World's New and Improved Action Super Hero.Reloaded - HUGE 10 out of 10 Stars.

It is plot less because it is a mere succession of action scenes that have no reason to be in the movie. There is the basic conflict between Neo and Agent Smith/the evil people in the Matrix, but this conflict is never built on or expanded. Instead, it is mired in pointless action scenes. There is never any suspense in the ridiculously long action scenes to hold the viewer's interest. Neo is, in fact, almost completely indestructible and so you know full well that he can defeat a few dozen Agent Smiths with ease.The movie is philosophically wrong because it perpetrates the belief that causality is the same as determinism. No, The Law of Causality states that the nature of the action(s) of an entity is determined by the nature of the entity doing the acting. Emphasis should be put on the word ""nature"" because volition does not contradict causality, as the Wachowski brothers seem to think. No, volitional consciousness is ""human nature"" and determines the way we act--our ability to choose our actions by means of thought/emotion. Volition, however, does not determine what specific choices we make, just that we can make a choice. Determinism is a type of causality where certain actions must occur because they were determined by past events; it is the opposite of volition, but does not contradict it because it is a separate idea. Any first year philosophy student would know this and recognize the error in the Wachowski brothers' thinking.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The story of the second Matrix remained as impressive to me asthe first.  I believe it was after Neo met a character by the name ofThe Architect that my brain faultered once or twice; that climacticscene held more weight for me than the rest combined.  And infact, the theological and philisophical overtones might keep mereading up for weeks.My only real problem with the film was the score.  At times itseemed out of place: for example, in the ""Burly Man Fight,"" I felt asthough somehow the soundtrack for the fourth installment ofIndiana Jones had been slipped in in place of what I wassupposed to hear--it just did not fit.  As for the dance/love scene, itis questionable; but if you remember the club scene from theoriginal it might just make sense.The film's form and sequence pushed past the first as well, withflash forwards and foreshadowing mimicking each other to createan interesting narrative flow.

This one is not about the mystique of ""What is the Matrix"" but actually focuses the watcher on the depth of attachment of the characters. The focus on character interaction and development is setting us up for the 3rd instalment, which I would expect to be more ""Action Packed"".   This character development has the same feel as how ""Empire Strikes Back"" set up ""The Return of the Jedi"".The special effects are amazingly done and look effortless, so effortless that sometimes you miss what went into the scene the first time you look at it.  The story hooks you in so you want to see the 3rd and final instalment as soon as it comes out.I Recommend to go see it, just don't expect to be shocked and awed the same way as when you saw the Matrix for the first time because you've already ""ventured down the rabbit hole""","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Then, I thought about the content a little bit. Then I almost got a headache. Ow.Then again, I had the same feeling with 2001 Space Odyssey. I first thought it was garbage, the second time I saw it it felt far more interesting.I was maybe just shocked because the movie is very different from the predecessor, yet it's more of the same. The Matrix *seemed* like a movie that was wholly self-contained. The sequel doesn't try to explain it, it just challenges it. There's pseudo-philosophical mumbojumbo that's different from the pseudo-philosophical mumbojumbo of the first movie - and it's presented in a different way. There's action and cool kung-fu that's different from action and cool kung-fu of the first movie.I have to say that in the end I'm not disappointed - it's a movie with cool action stuff and things that make you think and spout gibberish about nature of universe and all that. Great material if you like smart movies, good stuff if you want action. It is not without its flaws: some scenes (*ahem*) could have been cut down. The music choices aren't as memorable as in the first part (though the incidental music is still as good).It is, in my own humble opinion, a worthy continuation for The Matrix. It's just very *different* from what I expected. But surprise can be a good thing. And oh yes, I'm definitely waiting for the conclusion.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And within these 20 minutes there is no story in sight. What little there is, is utter nonsense.The characters are somehow even more one-dimensional this time around, the green filter is even more green, and everything looks as if someone puked over the screen. The fight scenes are meaningless and exist for their own sake, not to serve the plot in any meaningful way. This whole film is nothing but fan service for people who want to see CG stunts, preferably in slow motion, in scenes where nothing is ever at stake because everyone has super powers and is for all intents and purposes indestructible.Now, for a film in which absolutely nothing makes sense, there is an incredible amount of pseudo-philosophy shoved in. Listen: remove the utterly nonsensical premises of your film before bombarding us with fake philosophy.I was as emotionally moved and intellectually intrigued by this film as I would be from watching a CGI demonstration video. This whole film is like a super long trailer. You keep waiting for things to start happening, but there is no time, because there is punching and kicking and then more punching and kicking. Even Bruce Lee would be in a coma from all this fighting if he had to endure watching this.I will leave you with this thought:
Is any of these action scenes more suspenseful than the first act in the first Matrix film? I would say no. And here is why: when agents chased Neo at his workplace and then intimidated him in the interrogation room, he was powerless. He was in real danger. He couldn't just throw them through a wall and fly off. The very thing that defines these films - punching and kicking - is what took away all the suspense. How about they don't have super powers? Now that would be a lot more interesting. They can enter the Matrix but they have no Bruce Lee skills. That would have been infinitely better. Instead, the films became fan service for people who only want to be distracted with punching and kicking.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie will not become The Empire Strikes Back II: even though it is the second movie in the trilogy, it's nowhere near as good as the first one. The Empire Strikes Back was even better than its predecessor: while it was much more darker, there was much more character development, and the story became much clearer as we saw more of the galactic civil war.
Reloaded didn't give us more information than we already knew from the first film. We all know by now what the Matrix is, and we know about the struggle between man and machine. We know that this movie is part of one story with The Matrix Revolutions, but do we have to wait till November to find out if this movie (Reloaded) is really good? I mean, does this movie have to be good because it is part of a 2 part story arc? A good movie should stand on its own, and doesn't have to depend on an other movie.. correct me if I'm wrong.I mean: I LOVE Reloaded, if you like Special Effects, you'll get an overdose from this movie. The special effects are ching-ching, verrrrrrry goood! And don't trip on those movie-flaws people are searching for. If there are any nits, goofs etc, so what? The movie doesn't exactly get any better or worse because they are in them. Every movie has them, the most legendary, the ones with the best stories, they all have little flaws. It only makes you realize these are made by men, so it's only human.Don't go see this movie with the assumption that ""the movie WILL suck because people say the story isn't that kool"": NO! Because we all went Kahuna over the first film, we were expected much more, and sometimes people can't live up to all those expectations. It could have been worse and the Wachowski's could've add Pauly Shore to its cast, but no: it's not a nightmare! :)If there is one thing this movie most definitely excels in, it is Style! Everythings looks very stylish, and boy: do we want to have a wife like Persephone! Monica Belluci is very, how shall I say this, YUM!

Perhaps the third film will ultimately show that the Zion scenes were justified.  They appear to be introducing characters that may play a larger plot role in Revolutions.So, will the annoying kid have some key role in the third?  Obviously Cain will be important.  Will Niobe heal Morpheus and his shattered beliefs? Will Commander Lock be redeemed?  Will Counselor Hamaan play a key role in negotiating peace with the machines?If yes (or, given the Wachowski Brothers, more surprising plot twists), the scenes in Zion may make sense.  If no, then they are what they appear to be standing on their own, wasteful and self absorbed.  Regardless, we didn't need a love scene that has no heart to understand that Neo and Trinty's relationship has moved on.  Within this scene we didn't need the interruption at the elevator.  We already knew of Neo's Messiah status within Zion.  The Morpheus speech, tribal dance scene was embarrassing.Wouldn't the plot have moved along just fine if the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar had learned of Zion's plight via videophone communications with Zion?  In The Matrix we saw the world through the eyes of the Nebuchadnezzar's crew.  Knowing Zion existed was enough.  Wouldn't this have tightened the plot and kept the suspense tight.  The movie actually starts when the message from the Oracle is received.So, the flow is:Additional edits:Cut the length of the Burly Brawl by 3/4.  It looks fake anyway. The fight with Ghost is reminiscent of but a pale echo of the Morpheus/Neo encounter in The Matrix.  It is unnecessary and wastes time.
A far better film.  Unless all this stuff really is setup for Revolutions. I'm willing to give the Bros. the benefit of the doubt although nothing in the trailer shows it's true.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Matrix Trilogy is my all time favorite movie.  It's challenging, mind-blowing, and fun.  The fighting scenes are amazing and so entertaining. I can watch it over and over again and still find new moves that I didn't notice the first time.  In my opinon, there's no other fighting scene that can beat the one in Matrix Reloaded.Keanu and the other main characters did an excellent job portraying each of their roles.  You can really feel what's going through their minds as if you were reading a book and reading every little detail of what's going through their minds.  Their facial expressions, their reactions to the unknown and known situations brings you to experience their life in the ""real world"" and in the Matrix.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Know this, NOTHING is unimportant in these films, everything and everyone has a purpose and a meaning. The series is filled with so many metaphors and symbols that it takes hours of dissection to understand them all.

Upon viewing, the audience will no doubt be blown away by the near-seamless special effects. The fight sequences in Reloaded are nothing short of phenomenal: flowing, turbo-charged, and at times even clever. Not a single complaint there.The problem thus lies in Reloaded's style. Whereas the original Matrix is subtle, Reloaded tends to jump out and beat the audience senseless at unnecessary times. The Matrix was chock-full of violence (though not gore) and sexual tension (though not overdone explicitness, reminiscent of a low grade rap music video).  Reloaded seemed to take the easy way out of attracting the Average Joe viewer one too many times. I would suggest that the makers of this film remember that the audience occasionally enjoys figuring things out on their own, not being force-fed.I won't go so far as to say that Reloaded is bad, or to suggest that a potential viewer pass up this eye-feast of a film. I will, however, withhold my final judgment of the film for the second viewing, where I'm hoping that the seemingly gratuitous tendencies of the plot will resolve into satisfying underlying themes. (Reloaded's pacing is very stop-and-go, alternately subjecting the audience to long, incredible fight and chase sequences, and long, dialogue scenes; consequently causing the viewer to tend to zone out during the important dialogue scenes, thereby -- hopefully -- missing the less obvious underlying themes on the first go-around.)
All in all, Reloaded doesn't hold a candle to The Matrix, but is definitely worth the seven-odd bucks of a viewing, or if you hope to catch all the dialogue, the fourteen-odd bucks of a second.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If you are going to read this, I will say this first I think that the original matrix movie is the best sci-fi movie of all time in action, philosophy, direction, technology, and screenplay.  The second movie is infinitely worst in all aspect than the first one.1)  Taking away lines from a great actor like Laurence Fishburne and giving more to who I think is possible the worst mainstream movie actor there is in Keanu Reeves was a horrible idea2)  Having a freakin' random car chase in the movie was retarded.  I didn't like fast and the furious and hate randomly inserted car chase scene3)  Where as people are saying the philosophy of the second one is good, it strays away from a lot of the philosophical points of the first Matrix and add a whole bunch that really don't fit into the movie4)  In the first one the only matrix enemy was the Agents where now everything is a virus and the only agent really left is the only agent that died in the first one.  This philosophy is really flawed if you are considering this a ""sequal""5)  Love story between Keanu Reeves and carrie-anne moss = Just Horrible6)  The scene with the virus who can make a woman horny it just a stupid thing to throw in a movie especially if you want me to treat you as a serious director7)  The rave dance/party randomly thrown in the movie.  I would think that if you were the last few people left in the world and the robots are going to find you I don't think I would be in a cave dancing like I was in a rave.8)  The fight scenes were much cheesier and cornier than the first movie. I also didn't like the way they used the bullet-frame technology in this one, it was thrown in parts where it really didn't fit.
Now if I have not anger most of the people who love this movie I will say this.  If this was it's own movie I would have gave it a good rating, but it is a sequal.  This movie to me felt like watching star wars episode one. They thrown in a whole bunch of new things that are destroying some of the best aspects of the past movie.  Their was some good things about the movie, but then usually it was the horrible acting of Keanu Reeves or flawed philosophy that destroy any good aspect of the movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Unlike some, I was not really bothered by certain fight moves looking fake or anything like that.  I felt they were beautifully produced, and the result was outstanding.  Unfortunately the few great scenes were interupted by an annoying little thing called the rest of the movie.  Hardly ever have I seen such pointless dialouge go on and on and on.  There was simply too much talking, and not enough plot variation.My three issues with the movie were the following - 1) A highly random dance scene, which looked like some sort of hip-hop music video (in the mud) placed in the center of a rather serious/intelligent action movie.  Cool for a video, but misplaced in the movie. 2) too much talking for a movie of this sort 3) the last 20 minute of the film felt like it was being fastforwarded.  I felt that they spent way too much time on the first couple hours, and then tried to cut down the last section of the movie which to me was the most interesting.
A decent attempt at a sequel for Matrix, but it failed in too many department for me to give it a good score.  4/10 for great fight scenes, nothing else.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film was all over the place, but it still focused on Zion, humanity's homeworld, and the peril it was in from an invasion from ""the machines.""It seemed, at times, there were too many main characters in this film. About the time one would get into what one was doing, the director would shift the focus onto someone else, not bothering to make any connection.  I don't know...maybe I needed to pay closer attention than I did because I spent more time turning the sound up during conversations and then back down when all the special effects took over.The special effects were a little too much.

Where the original was consistent and thought provoking this movie was had me thinking ""What the hell are you trying to say?"" or had me not thinking at all. The original had a good concept, that our lives are a lie, and made good use of special effects but was not dependent on them as the story had a solid narrative. And even though it was a little complicated at first, it was soon understandable what was going on in that universe. This movie went from one extreme to the other; if there was not a whole lot of complicated and unnecessary jibberish  then there was just a whole lot of beat em up action. Much of the jibberish spoken I found incomprehensible. At some point in the mumbo-jumbo the speakers said an understandable sentence or two which got the point through and summed up all they needed to say in nutshell, but after they said it they continued on. Too much emphasis had been placed on the special effects in this one. More than necessary. Too many special effects and they're nothing. Each fight scene went for so long it was dull. Special effects are supposed to help the story along not be a substitute for it, and they are no substitute anyway for a descent, solid, consistent, original and entertaining narrative. They weren't that good anyway. And as for that rave party, that was just plain rediciulous. With all the lousy music and lousy dancing, they might as well have had flashing lights going and a bar while they were at it. They should have left it out. That speech on the rock was just pretentious.The pattern of the movie; fight, jibberish, fight, jibberish etc. Incomprehensible dialogue, high pumped special effects driven fight scenes and a weak story line were what this effort consisted of.Not an enjoyable experience.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

He loved Matrix:Reloaded (though he admitted it was not perfect).Picky people like me will wonder why the freeway scenes have signs that can only be read in the drivers' rear-vision mirrors. It was filmed here in Australia, but if they were going to pretend it's America then little details like this could easily have been attended to.I really did like the first Matrix movie - in which Keanu was totally charming and got a chance to act. There was character development, a tight enough script, it was well paced, with action scenes that were impressive and concise, and there was a plot you actually cared to get involved with. Unfortunately I found Matrix:Reloaded to be reloaded with absolute tedium - it's all technology and very little substance. Hi-tech PC games fans will no doubt think that it's heaven on a stick and they'll race out to buy the X-box game and start getting excited about Matrix 3.As a sequel I believe that X-Men ll leaves this film wallowing in it's dust - and I think I'll go and see X-ll  again just to wash the remnant skid-marks of Matrix-Reloaded from my synapses.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There were many more underlying meanings and deep symbolism. Now, those outside of the matrix were less rebels and more members of a cult. They were supposed to be struggling with life outside of the matrix, NOT becoming primative humans who enjoy raving to bongo drums. Not to mention the whole Titanic love scene which created a bad underlining plot.

However as a follow-up to the original Matrix film it is a profound disappointment in so many ways.  I have many problems with the film both in comparison with the original Matrix film and as a movie in its own right.The first Matrix film for me was not especially about the action  it was about the intriguing idea of the Matrix and in fact a large proportion of the first movie was devoted to Neo's quest to discover the nature of the Matrix, and his self-doubt about whether or not he was `The One'.  The first time I saw the Matrix was on a tiny screen on a plane, not ideal for a big budget action movie you would think, and yet it still worked.  Other interesting points about it included Morpheus' unshakeable belief in Neo, the doubts of the other crewmates of the Nebukannesser, the betrayal of Morpheus by one crew member (played by Joe Pantoliani).But the sequel has none of the intrigue, tension and intelligence displayed by the original.  Sure it's got lots of state of the art action, although none of it matches the impact of the first movie, but the storyline was muddled and unclear.  One thing that grated especially for me included the extended love making scene with Neo and Trinity and the accompanying mass dance/orgy.  The production and costume design for the city of Zion seemed poor  it was the type of thing that I would expect from a TV series not a bug budget film  the Zion costumes were a kind of grungy hippy style mixed up with some eastern influences.  In fact the whole story line concerning Zion and its attempt to repel invaders was poorly handled and the eventual battle was not actually shown just discussed between characters.The script was poor and the dialogue often cheesy.The cast of the film were in general no more than acceptable, which is probably as much as you might expect in a movie like this.  Of the main cast, the standout performance was given by Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith and in the supporting cast, Finally, if you sit through all the credits at the end of the film (and believe me, there are a lot) then you also get to see a preview of the final film in the Matrix trilogy  Matrix Revolutions.Overall, a spectacular, but also disappointing and in some places extremely poor follow up to a ground breaking original film.  The Matrix Reloaded delivers the action that many will have been hoping for, but fails to provide a fully rounded cinema experience.  It is absolutely no match for some of the other high quality blockbuster films we have seen over the past year, such as Spider-Man, The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers and X2. Unlike these three films, I have no particular desire to see The Matrix Reloaded again and I will not be buying a copy on DVD. Not recommended - however if you are going to see this film anyway, then by all means see it on a big screen with big sound where you can get the full impact of the action sequences, even if they are pretty meaningless.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first Matrix was a genuinely great movie.  Some where along the way, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" turned into a dud.  The fight scenes are too long.  They should have more fight scenes that go for shorter periods of time.  I can't see the point in Keanu continuously beating up the same people over and over again, especially when he has the power to fly away.  The movie gets too complicated.  The story isn't easy to follow.  The ending is very poor, leading to an extremely obvious third movie.  The ending leaves a feeling of ""Is that it.""","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That's one of the most stimulating things in movies... But whatever deep/intellectual psychobabble they crammed into this film was too much to even make out due to its jumbled nature, and the ideas that were actually presented in a clear and cohesive manner were nothing new; it's the kind of stuff I've been thinking about since I was 12 and have already reached all the ""revelations"" by 14...Morpheus, the Architect, and the french guy in the middle all seem to have Thesauri up their asses because every line they pull out of there is chock full of words that you need an English degree from Dartmouth to understand. Sure, I can take out a dictionary and learn them, that's not hard to do. Sure, I can see the movie again and pause at every sentence just to process and think about the 7 ideas included and repeat the procedure for the next sentence. But that's not good filmmaking. You can make a great film that's entertaining but has no point, but you can't make a good film that's heavily thematic, but too jumbled to be entertaining. It's no wonder you find ""Movies"" in the ""Entertainment"" (rather than the ""Science"") section of the newspaper; a film must first entertain. Whether you do it with brainless slaughterfests or with a lecture by Stephen Hawking is irrelevant.And that's where this sequel f***ed up. The hodgepodge of intellectual dialogue is discernible only when the movie is watched 600 times and the ideas are analyzed to shreds. And that's exactly what the Wachowski brothers are aiming for: a new wave of Matrix cult fans to peruse deep into the film and get excited every time they make another new connection. This, of course, was already done to death with the first film, in which Neo = The One, Morpheus = God of Dreams, Nebuchadnezzar = etc... Throwing in obvious religious and mythical references such as these may be ""cool"", but is hardly anything to base a movie on. And the twisting plotline only helps the film feel like scrambled eggs. But once again, the movie evokes interest only when reviewed a million times. Unfortunately, $8.50 was already too much for me to spend on it.When you're confused while watching this movie, you may be tempted to wonder if Larry and Andy threw together an inkblot of a movie and left the interpretation up in the air for people to gaze at and see whatever it is they want. (Which is not a bad thing to do, but must provide some serious food for thought instead of empty fodder for cute little allegorical connections)Another chief rule in film story: The audience has to give a damn about the characters. Who can honestly be concerned for the invicible and all-powerful Neo's welfare when there's 100 CGI Agent Smiths attacking a computized mockup of himself? The background beat makes virtually every fight sequence seem more like a peaceful and choreographed dance than a real and agonizing struggle. If Neo can kick anyone's ass, why waste 30 combined minutes of the film confirming what we already know?The threat of Trinity dying was lame and unprovoking. Neo died in the last Matrix and came back to life seconds later. Same thing happened to Trinity. I assume it's Morpheus's turn in Revolutions. Just like in any typical war saga, it is only the minor and unimportant characters who ever die, and our knowledge of that heading into this film is barely shaken as it progresses.I agree with those who hail the first Matrix as a smart classic. Though you can try and attribute its success to the intelligent plotline or deep messages, but first and foremost, it was just cool. You can't argue with that. It created its own universally recognized trademark, a lot like Batman or the Terminator, and that instantly struck a chord with audiences. And indeed, the dark shades/trenchcoat/guns look was instantly associated with the Matrix (How easily was it recognized in the Columbine incident?).
And yes, when I ventured to a Hot Topic shortly after the film opened, what did I see but a brand new array of black trenchcoats for sale, along with a display of new sunglasses? Face it, The Matrix is cool. People love the stylized image. And that was the first thing that contributed to the success of the orignal Matrix. Matrix 2 has a bit of these new images to offer (like the albino Rastafarians), but overall, shows us nothing else distinctive. Perhaps the film should've been titled ""The Matrix: Regurgitated"", as it reuses and intensifies old tactics but loses its creativeness and originality in the process.Finally, one of the most painful things that a sequel can do to a viewer is to destroy their conceptions of the franchise's plotline. As we have previously seen, a successful and bright outlook at the end of MIB was completely trashed and destroyed in MIB2, creating its own unnessessarily harsh reality. A sequel should favorably continue and build on a story, rather than destroy or rearrange it with its own pitfall-like revelations.----------------------------------------Miscellaneous: Morpeus's speech to the masses at Zion made him look less like the intelligent and sophisticated leader of the resistance in the first Matrix, and more like a hormonally-charged ape bellowing some patriotic mumbo-jumbo to his primate followers.This, of course, was followed with a sex/rave scene that I didn't understand at all. ""Oh s***, the machines are coming, we better f*** each other like animals so that we can repopulate the Earth when the machines blow Zion to hell!""? I figure this was thrown in for the horny teens (or maybe there just to secure the film an R rating so that the fans don't think the directors ""wussed out"" with a milder sequel, since there is little else in the movie that a PG-13 rating wouldn't easily cover). The crotch close-up of the woman at the restaurant was also pointless and arousing only to 13-year-olds...-------------------Watch the movie, but don't throw away theater ticket money... maybe go to a party where someone else has spent their money on renting the DVD and see for yourself why the second installment seems a bit flat.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Actually, it kind of reminded me of ""Star Trek"" or ""Star Wars."" Anyway, it just seemed to drag on and I didn't think it was that necessary. The whole Neo and Trinity thing can get pretty annoying and boring as well. I guess the fighting scenes were pretty cool, but then again, there were some scenes that Neo fought in and I would just think to myself ""Why doesn't he just use his new flying ability that he's obtained and get out of there instead of going through all of this fighting?""

The Matrix was great fun! As for this mess, no more than the last 20 minutes deserves any mention at all. Even at that, it is pretentious, seriously daft, but stylish in the way the first film was. This could easily have been part of the first film, thus avoiding the tiresome drivel that this film is. I found an urgent need to take a toilet break after 20 minutes and a great fascination with my watch face thereafter. Thankfully I never saw this in the cinema. Where do I begin. With the given, Keanu Reeves can't act and never could !! There is more to life than wearing long coats and shades. This film demands someone with a touch of acting ability. The only ones that can, are parodies of themselves. Hugo Weaving sadly can't seem to get beyond ""Mr Anderson"" and surrendering to the tyranny of of multiple personality disorder. Laurence Fishbourne indulges in that fire-gazing caveman piffle that claims to be philosophy and is seen so infrequently that you suspect he must've had a disagreement over his paycheque. In short the film is shorn of an iota of plotline, bereft of any acting skills and it's only success is the massive sigh of relief it inspires when the final credits roll.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Matrix Reloaded simply put, takes Dorothy's Hole and stretches quite a bit deeper, expanding the philosophy of simulation vs. reality, and compounded the messiah myth of the first film, all at the same time bending those rules and still provided enough material to leave you guessing for days.It is true that much of these films have been done before, indeed, Zion is very similar to a sietch out of Dune and Neo's messiah characteristics are not dissimilar from Maud'dib, and other messiah characters in more mundane science-fiction.  But what separates Matrix from these other films and works, including the greats like Philip K Dick is the overwhelming style and amazing timing and editing style that is ubiqitious throughout these films. This film's beats and cues are as tight as any top DJ.The only complaints about the film is the ambiguity left at the end of the film, but these complaints are petty given that the 3rd installment is only months away.  Yes, its a cliffhanger.  But yes, there is a lot of story, character development and serious kung fu.Enjoy the best film of the summer.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If you didn't know, you need to learn to respect movies and need to watch the movie until it is finished. Oh, and never leave a movie-theatre before the credits finish.Right, The Matrix Reloaded, this sequel could have been brilliant. All the elements were there. It was designed as part of the matrix trilogy, the first one was genius and the story of reloaded is wonderful. But, I'm torn between two sides.The acting of most characters has been done adequately to very good. A number of less important characters did not perform up to the quality necessary to make Reloaded as good as the Matrix. Camera work and mise en scène were as good as the original. The general atmosphere was slightly different, but almost as good.Then what was bad about the movie? First of all, there is a glitch in the Matrix Reloaded. In the Matrix, we learn that all agents need to obey the rules, yet the twins can shape shift into ghosts. These two do not fit into the matrix trilogy, they should have been written for the X-series.Secondly, too many long and unnecessary scenes, topped by the 'party in Zion/porn' sequence. This sequence is too long and irrelevant to the movie, it seems to be pasted into Reloaded to lengthen it. The atmosphere in the scene was all wrong, it was more like a Dune Miniseries scene. The length of the fighting scenes is debatable. Lets say that the car chase sequence was slightly over the top, thus lessening the quality of the movie.For all you people who think that The Matrix was brilliant for its fighting scenes, Reloaded is an excellent movie. Although it is impossible to top the brilliance of the fighting sequences of the first matrix. For all people who know The Matrix was an excellent movie because of the idea, the atmosphere, the acting and its fighting scenes, Reloaded is a very good movie, as long as you get past the enormous party scene.I gave The Matrix a score of 10/10, I think i will rate Reloaded 8/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Not as much mystery as the first (understandable). Not as much streetwise attitude as the first (unusual). The second film moves away from being enigmatic, and leans closer toward being regular ""epic"" science fiction.Also gets caught up in its own cleverness, particularly toward the end where parts become hard to follow (could be a problem with editing).Great action (especially the fight with a great number of suited attackers). The characters in this series have never been particularly charismatic or played with personality (I guess that's the comic book feel it strives for, and succeeds at), but it was the tough attitude that made the first one work (as well as its central idea).  No charisma this time, either.  Feels flat in parts.  Gets very talky and dull in long stretches.One heck of a car chase, though.Enjoyable, though you'd be forgiven if you forgot it within half a day. Too mystical for its own good, yet still fun when you don't have to think.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It seems that, in a rush to the box office to collect on The Matrix hype, Reloaded seems to have left much of the substance of plot behind in favor of astounding effects and sex.After watching Reloaded, my involvement with the characters was less than it was at the end of The Matrix.  I felt especially disassociated to the newer supporting characters to the point where I didn't care if any one lived to be in the third Matrix movie.The effects in Reloaded were an order of magnitude better than The Matrix. The choreography in the many fight scenes was astounding and sometimes left my eyes behind in the dust, trying to keep up.  The fights also took on more of a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon feel as Neo's fighting style has matured since The Matrix.Sex takes up a much larger role in Reloaded than in the previous movie, although that role was probably much larger than necessary.  For about a 5 minute stretch, we are ""treated"" to a fairly steamy sexual encounter that seems completely unnecessary, given the relationship between the characters involved.  The time would have been better spent beefing up the story with some more interesting interactions between the characters.Although fans of The Matrix realize that Reloaded is only the second movie in a series of three, the movie's end left me with the feeling that maybe the movie reel had broken up in the projection room and the projectionist decided that was as good a stopping point as any.Overall, Reloaded is very much a let down, considering the stellar success of its predecessor.  We can only hope for a return to the story in the final installment of The Matrix franchise.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is a good summary of the plot, don't expect to see more than that. The first matrix innovated for its special effects. This one is just the same, seen too many times in other movies now. The plot ? Very thin. We don't learn much. The characters are empty and shallow. They say something and just the opposite after just to look smart. The visuals are bad, chaotic.

The special effects are wonderful. Now if they only spent more time with the story, the movie would be much better.Dialog is better than the third since the third just reiterates comments from the first. But this movie has to be judged by its three major flaws:1) limitations put on Neo (he doesn't seem as super-powered as as it was suggested in the first movie) 2) the rave/sex scene 3) the dreary design of ZionThe first problem is due to the fact that while ending given at the end of the original Matrix made it sequeable, the problem remains on how do you sequel a movie with the powers that Neo is given. Its the same problem that Superman faced and the results seem as unsatisfying as Superman II but without the comedy. The problem is that Superman always had some limitations (Kryptonite, Magic, etc.) while Neo is given none of these in the first movie. So in order to there to be some conflict, his powers seem to be initially less than in the first.The second problem just is an editing problem. This long scene was unnecessary, makes the Zionites look like just a bunch a hedonists. Contrast that with the first movie's implied view that hedonism was a construct of the Matrix to keep control and a seduction even those who know it is illusion. The violence of the first movie was more of a video game violence and the movie could be shown to children under the age of seventeen with caution. However, it is obvious that this movie should not.However, the third and worse flaw of the movie is design of Zion. Words do mean things and Zion is the mount to where the Temple of Jerusalem was placed; the word Zion also is often used for the Jerusalem and Israel itself. With the technology at their disposal why couldn't Zion seem something like Hobbiton: a true alternative to the dreary Matrix skyscraper world and reality of how the earth now exists. Instead we are given a world that seems inferior the skyscraper construct of the Matrix and makes us think that Cypher's choice in the first movie was immoral but understandable.What the creators of the Matrix don't seem to realize is that people fight for what is behind them: their families, friends, towns and country, not what is in front of them. The first Matrix movie could get away from this because we could imagine Zion as a wonderful place. However its reality makes it a much difficult to imagine people wanting to fight for it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There are, of course, exceptions (THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK for one). For example, while very entertaining, so much of BACK TO THE FUTURE PART 2 was about getting us to Part 3 that I think it really suffered as a whole. And TEMPLE OF DOOM is infamous for starting the PG-13 rating, if it wasn't enough to just be a letdown. I mean, if Spielberg and Zemeckis struggle with those second parters, heaven help anyone else.So it is, it seems, with the Matrix trilogy. By the time Reloaded was made, it appeared as if all references to what made the first film so entertainingly original were overshadowed by pseudo intellectual psycho-babble and ultra-expensive effects. To be fair, it's been said that something is only new once, and that's certainly an idea working against anything following such an original action piece as THE MATRIX. And again, now that a larger story has been coerced out of the first movie's principle universe, the usual and unfortunate amount of setup must be done to motivate us toward the third installment.My fingers are crossed, that Revolutions somehow makes sense out of Reloaded. That would at least justify it's existence. When I entered the theater, I was really hoping for a ""Two Towers"" level followup, something that really moved the story forward and gave us really exciting new characters instead of throw aways. But as I left the theater, all I really felt I got from Reloaded, was a good long car chase.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What I got, in my opinion, was dross.  While this movie had very pretty fight scenes, going places no one else had been, like the first movie, it spent more time reveling in gratuitous moments than it did developing the aura and story of the world.  The love scene intercut with the dancing, would have been beautiful had it been shorter, but cut in the full length bordered on pornographic.  The schoolyard fight with the Smith Clones was spectacular, yes, but this movie was not based around a fighting competition with artistic points.  There was an actual war going on.  When Neo figured out that he couldn't win, which the audience did very early on, he should have taken off like he ended up doing later anyway.  There were better uses to which he could put his energy.  And the car chase made me sick to my stomach to watch on the big screen.  It was also too long.I do give the writers and director some points for the art.  There is still a lot of things to be said with what was introduced in the movie.  The twins for example were interesting, and the war converging on Zion lent an underlying urgency to the movie.  Even the age old do I save the world, or do I save the one I love battle was well played.  But as with many miracles of the scientific world, just because you can do something, that doesn't mean you should.I see a lot of movies in theater, and own still more.  Rest assured, this will not enter my collection, nor will I see in theaters or purchase Revolutions.  I won't spend any more money on this franchise, and I won't be sullying the original by trying to add this to it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Reading through a lot of these reviews it would appear there are many viewers unanimous in what went wrong with this turkey. We can all see what the Wachowski brothers couldn't. That they were making a soulless, almost laughable film. This film could have been edited down to 10 minutes if it's purpose was to further the story of The Matrix. Sadly the directors' purpose here was to make a mechanical turkey. A self absorbed love letter to themselves. The cringe worthy Morpheus speech. The rave. The love scene. The Burly Brawl. All of them a complete waste of time and ultimately pointless. Ironic when you consider the films showpiece (the freeway chase) resembles the film itself. A wreckage. The original film was a novel idea where each scene served a purpose to further the narrative, allowing the story to flow. This film has none of that and worse still, treats the viewer with utter contempt. They think pitting Neo against 100 Agent Smith's for no other reason that just because will satisfy the viewer. They're wrong. The whole scene stinks of contrivance. The Wachowski's still have an eye for flair in their direction, that much is clear. Some of the shots are breathtaking. However if the script itself isn't up to the job then the whole exercise is void. Just like this film.Niz","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That seemed to be the reaction of the entire theater as well.(Best laugh, watch the ""100 Smiths"" fight in the city park with Neo, see how many times you can tell Neo is an animated cartoon and not remotely real looking).to be concluded...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Even in the first movie, it was the same thing - the agents, and Cypher the human who betrays humanity.

No, this one is weighed down by the Wachowski Brothers'... something.  I'd like to call it overconfidence, but I don't think that applies.  They don't have to be overconfident because there's no doubt the film is going to make a killing.  I got the impression that they were, along with making a Matrix sequel, trying to make every other movie they've ever wanted to make.  It's deep, talky, slow more often than not, bordering on dreary in some places.  All punctuated by long, drawn-out and undeniably captivating action sequences.  Audiences thrilled by the first one will not find the same kind of entertainment here.  The movie is *different*.  It is not The Matrix (I).  It feels completely different.  That's fine... it's bigger and more ambitious.  The bad part is the self indulgence.  There are at least two or three scenes that are bad, really bad... embarrassingly dumb bad.  Fortunately the worst of these scenes occurs pretty early in the film.  Is it really necessary to watch Neo have sex with Trinity, all the way to completion for five long minutes (no exaggeration) while intercutting a Zion rave party?  That's ridiculous. Why are they dancing anyway?  The movie lost me there.  Up to that point, it had a cool Star Wars feel with the exception of the introduction of one particularly dumb character that should and could have been deleted from the movie.  No problem with sex scenes... they could have kept the Neo and Trinity stuff intact, but the alternating Zion Dance Party looks ridiculous by even today's standards and will definitely date the film in years to come.  Were the editors afraid of the Wach Brothers or something?Ah, the self-indulgence.  Countless scenes with characters spouting philosophic, existential hokum to no end.  Some dialogue good, some painful. All very sloppy since it could have been condensed, or at least create interesting characters and/or actors to spout it.  But there's no way that dialogue or at least the points therein deserved so much time.  About the third instance Merovingian repeated his own dialogue I found myself becoming angry.  Did they shoot the first draft?The effects are amazing, everyone who's complaining about the CGI Neo needs to chill.  Maybe two times I realized it was a CG Keanu flying around, but I defy any movie to do the sequences more convincingly.  I will say this: The fights in this, while beautiful, do seem to lack the visceral thrill of the original.  I read some review that said Agent Smith should've gotten his teeth knocked out at least once.  Not sure about the non-human Agent Smith, but someone should have.The freeway scene is spectacular, the jewel being the huge brawl between Morpheus and a Matrix agent atop a semi.  This was somewhat ruined for me since I had dirtbags behind me talking on a cell phone.  I had to change seats twice during the course of the movie.  That didn't stop me from noticing Trinity mounting herself on the motorcycle though... YOW.  That's destined to become a legendary screen grab.  The cycle ride itself is nothing short of awesome.So the slow stuff really grates on you after a while... it asks way too much of an audience that's been infatuated with the original.  This is heady stuff, nowhere near as accessible as the four year-old original.  For that reason, I expect it to die soon with mainstream audiences.  It's just an exhausting experience.  It's near Lord of the Rings length at just about two and a half hours.  It's something to be better examined on DVD, with its nuances and extremely complicated story.  Personally, it will take two or three viewings for me to absorb everything that's been laid out to determine if really is the overbaked morass it seems.  In one of the climactic (non-action) scenes which is drawn out pointlessly, the movie suddenly becomes, or is trying to become 2001: A Space Odyssey. It also uses a movie gimmick I'm not very fond of:  Using your own footage and/or stock WWII footage to decorate a scene or illustrate your pont.  This movie uses both. Yuck!See it in the theaters, buy the DVD.  Embrace the trilogy for its ambition. You could learn to love it.  Stay after the credits in the theater though, for the preview for The Matrix Revolutions.  Only time and patience will tell if this is one of the most intelligent science fiction sagas we're bound to see in our lifetimes.  But the entertainment value for this chapter wasn't always there for me.  Then again, I did seem to find every dirtbag in the theater.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This created high expectations but ""Matrix Reloaded"" is not able to make use of the given possibilities. The very first scenes point out where the following will lead: deep down to the dread of Computer-animations.Right from the start the Wachowsky's seem to enjoy the exploration of technical possibilities - too much. They use too many FX and too much action. It doesn't leave enough time for storytelling. Therefore what's left is a rudimentary idea (a theme about causality) blown up with action and FX. ""Matrix Reloaded"" lacks personality. It's a FX-pregnant Sci-fi B-Movie that missed a chance to become great.In a short: Perhaps if you don't care for a good story, you'll like it - but I really can't recommend it ! Disappointing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I loved the first Matrix. I came into theater saying ""I love you!"" ""Be good to me"" and it spit in my face. The first Matrix was dark, mysterious, suspenseful, and surprising. The Matrix reloaded had nothing to offer me but rehashed, unmotivated special effects, mind-numbingly boring tirades about good programs, bad programs, free programs, and a layer of philosophical waxing that falls just below fortune cookies in my hierarchy of relevance. Don't tell me you're thinking about philosophical questions, make me question them by rocking my world like you did in the first one. I can not believe they did not show Neo free one mind. That's what I want to see. I want to see Neo become like Morpheus. He should be teaching people how to fight like him. I don't care about Link, or Morpheus' love triangle (which was horribly written) or some 15 minute orgy in Zion. What the hell, was that????? Even the special effects were not special. Granted a few were cool, but I didn't care. When Neo finds the ability to dodge bullets in the first one, that is a huge accomplishment. Nothing here is an accomplishment. No suspense means you can fight 100 agent Smiths and it doesn't mean anything. There is no way to express in 250 words how much I hated this movie. I'm still reeling from the ball crushing experience of seeing this film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I saw it on opening weekend with a crowd of friends and fell in love with its originality, jaw-dropping action, and creativity. That said ""The Matrix Reloaded"" can only be described as a complete dissapointment. Yes, the action sequences are spectacular (extremely long, but spectacular) and pretty much everyone who did the first one is back for round 2, but Reloaded is missing the magic of the original Matrix. No amount of action can compensate for a poor script, which Reloaded is crippled by. Some of the special effects (including humans created entirely by CGI) are questionable and the bad acting is clearly evident where it wasn't as noticable in the original. I can't help thinking that ""The Matrix"" was meant to stand on its own as one movie and when it unexpectedly (yes, if you do remember, ""The Matrix"" was a surprise hit) hit big at the box office everyone decided to go after a bigger piece of the pie and make two sequels. Unfortunate, yes, dissapointing, yes, surprising, no. If you loved ""The Matrix"" by all means go and see ""Reloaded"", just don't expect lightning to strike in the same place twice.5/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

None of the cast can act - Keanu is still one of the worst actors in history, Fishburne is still unconvincing as an inspirational hero, Moss is still capable of looking puzzled and Weaving can only grimace lots.2. The Wachowskis cannot write dialogue.  Keanu sitting on a bench confusing the hell out of us, a French bloke in a restaurant confusing the hell out of us, and pretty ropey stuff connecting it all.3. It's too dark.  On does not look cool in a full length black jacket, that is too tight around the neck.  Too many people wear black, and the whole thing looks rather dingy.4. Nobody can properly do a decent CGI human being.  The computer generated Keanu looks more like Bruce Campbell, which would actually be an improvement.Yes there are good special effects, but a series of nice looking scenes alone does not make a good film.My Rating: 4/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film spends more time on how can we put as many effects into the short space of time, rather than actually thinking of another new concept of the original storyline. For example what was the point of the car chase scene, all that it shows is that wow you can fight and bend the rules of the matrix and fight some more, but again missing the point because it never explains what for, throughout the film there is never any reason for why the characters are doing what they are doing. I know that the first matrix is always going to be a hard film to follow, but it seemed as though a storyline was not even thought about.In the first matrix film the scene is set, and the matrix along with the other concepts of the matrix are explained, leaving the second film more than open to take the idea further, but it just never happened instead the film just ends up flying off in all directions with mini plots. I find it hard to see how any person could have done worse with this film, by all means if you want to see a film all about the latest effects then this is the film, but other than that there is nothing else to the film, 3/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The first film ended nicely and it wasn't necessary to show what happens after that.The way this film was written reminded me of cheap SNES RPG's: first you must find the key master, then you must open the gates to the tree of life before Astos does, use your mana to destroy him.The writing was ridiculously bad, all those revelations and secrets revealed, neither intrigued me or surprised me, not because I knew, but because i didn't care.The additional characters like Link, his family and that annoying kid who worships Neo, were lame and not compelling. That kid was seriously the Matrix's answer to Jar Jar Binks, but the real question is, why would they want a character like that? Link's motivation to join the team was strained, and both he and his wife seemed dead and emotion-less.The acting was terrible. If it's possible Keanu Reeves has sunk to a new level of bad acting. There was bad acting in the first one but the incredible story and supporting cast made up for it, this time they just made it worse.The so-called cutting edge special effects were incredibly disappointing. Often scenes involving special effects were just completely CGI. The CGI in this film was badly rendered, no texture, video games have better computer animation. In defense of the animation, though, the movement was well done.There is a scene that lasts at least five minutes, that is a crowded, sexually charged rave scene, inter-spliced with a sex scene between Neo and Trinity. Maybe a minute of this with tamer sexuality would have been good, but the fact that it went on for so long, was simply baffling. And the unnecessary shots of women's breasts through completely see-through shirts, were just surprising, for a film like this.The only redeeming qualities of this film were Agent Smith, the Marovingian swearing, and the fight scenes, which even with the sub par animation were cool and intense as usual. but unlike the first it has definitely not set any standard for sci-fi or special effects.4/10, only because of the fighting and Agent Smith.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

With movies like X-men 2 improving on on the first, we've come to expect the sequel to be as good, if not better than the original.  With the Matrix being billed as a trilogy (even originally being pitched as such) I thought that Reloaded would live up to the hype. Unfortunately it didn't. The action sequences were awesome but the story lagged in between. Whereas the original Matrix used imagery to explain the philosophical themes (e.g. the battery analogy)  Reloaded tried to drive it's point with dialogue, spoken in almost a lecturing tone.  Now I have been through enough university lectures to not want them rehashed in movie form between action sequences. Although the ideas are clever, there's no point delivering them to an audience who only occasionally wakes up to an explosion here or there.  Over all, the Matrix was a let down, though worth seeing just so you can watch the special effects and complain about the plot at the next party you attend.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is axiomatic that Hollywood will persistently ""cash in"" on the success of an original by throwing out a sequel and then driving it to success with a huge marketing machine. MR is a prime example of such marketing cynicism.There is a subplot - the love between Trinity and Neo - but this is underdone and written so clumsily, it only detracts from the main plot, such as it is.Within the first half hour, the martial arts sequences had well and truly worn out their welcome and Lawrence Fishburn was looking more and more like a schoolchild in a playground emulating Bruce Lee. To increase the insult, the slow-motion clips so beloved of Hollywood (but apparently nowhere else) and done to ridiculous effect in Mission Impossible 2, detract from the apparent skill and inherent excitement of a fight scene. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon offered lessons in how to do such scenes that nobody on MR seemed capable of learning.The one redeeming aspect of the movie was the chase scene early on, which was exciting, but ultimately unrewarding as the remainder of the movie served up more blandness and cliche.With interest waning, there was little else to do but pick at the credibility holes in the plot, and since these have probably been done to death by other reviewers, it aids nobody if they're repeated here.So, without originality, acting that is standard at best, action sequences that are monotonous for the most part, and a plot with gaping holes, it is only the special effects that make the movie worth seeing. But that is not enough to make it worthwhile.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Once you've seen those there is no need to see the film ever again. Away from the effects, the plot is weak and dull. With the effects, the fights are overlong and at one point there are five minutes of blocking one another which is more like kung fu line dancing. Awful. Its then ended with 'You never know someone until you fight them' or something like that yet in 5 minutes they only hit each other once. Trinity seems to lose most fights shes ever in and quickly.

What a god-awful piece of crap that is. Discombobulated story, bad acting, bad script, very little story direction, even bad musical score. What a disappointment. We had stayed up late on Thursday, after a longer than necessary week, just to see the first Matrix again to make sure we had the story details right. Unfortunately, it seems like the whole Lord of the Rings all over again. The first one, outstanding, the sequel financially successful on hype or anticipation alone, but falling flat as a story. My only hope now is that every characted will die in part three so they can't make another sequel.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But myself and the group I saw it with came out disappointed after this film. It felt long; not just the dialogue scenes between the action sequences, but often the action sequences themselves. With the exception of the freeway scene, most action sequences were boring, maybe because they were much longer than those shown in the original, maybe because often the outcome of the skirmish was not clear (ie resulting in a victor or chase). Also, most fight scenes were very martial arts based, rather than a nice balance between gun-play and hand-to-hand. And those much hyped digital doubles for the actors were no where near what they were claimed to be (by those responsible - indistinguishable from the real actors). The beginning felt like watching a video game. I know I've reviewed this very comparatively to the original, but a sequel of this sort cannot be judged without comparison. To its credit, the final 30 minutes far surpassed the 100 before it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

To make matters worse, Morpheus - one of the central characters in the first part of the trilogy - seems to have turned into a crazed lunatic delivering a speech that closely resembles the one the President gave in ""Independence Day"".The masses of Zion, though, thrive on his words and immediately dance like crazy in what reminded me of the dance sequence in the first ""Blade""-movie. All in all: the first half hour of the film disappointed me very much. It´s almost unbearable to sit through.But wait for what comes after that: I think it is legitimate to call the highway fight- and chase sequence one of the most dazzling visual attractions that have hit the screen yet!Unfortunately, I wasn´t able to follow all of the philosophical paranoia statements that characters in the film make. I was especially dumbfounded by the scene where Neo meets the creator of the Matrix. So, I´ll admit it, I WILL go to see the film again!It seems like an instant classic in the new genre of cyber thrillers!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Now some of you reviewers please don't start tearing me apart in your reviews, I'm just trying to discuss a few of the things that I felt kept this film from being more fulfilling. There are so many others gushing about how they loved it, so there's room for others too.Unless you're a die-hard fan of this ""graphic novel/anime"" genre (I've found most discussions about it rather humorous as guys trying too hard to sound ""hip""), all the film's mumbo jumbo speeches of the ""wherever you go, there you are"" vein become a bit tiresome like Shakespeare doublespeek. I almost felt like fast-forwarding through some of the long, drawn-out yakking. I'm not downing you if you enjoy that, but it's like so many kids I know that claim they like certain bands or talk about anime's meanings just to be accepted as part of the cool crowd. If you reallllly listen to some of these speeches, they basically are just stretched out sentences that could have been said in a few words -- and it's interesting how in the future, all these underground folks seem to have better diction than the trend for the ""hip-hop"" diction of today.Rather than really trying to design a culture and dialect that would possibly reflect a future society, the filmmakers have decided to appease the trend-seeking white kids of today by throwing in LOTS of extended martial arts, a largely black cast that speaks better English than the audience this film is targeted for in order to make the film seem intelligent (though I was actually happy to not hear words like ""yo, ya know what I'm sayin', arright, and dude""), and ""important"" music by Rage Against The Machine. Funny how all the songs that are used to sell the CD soundtrack are usually thrown over the end credits. When I see obvious attempts to distract people by trend-association, that takes away a lot of the interest for me. It even tries to throw in the ""women are all inherently bisexual"" element in a subtle way to thrill the guys: look carefully at the big dance scene and you'll see some gals grinding their bodies together; of course they wouldn't show any men doing this. No one seemed to have shoes, but seem to have an excellent education in Technology, English, and Hairstyles! Ah, or is THIS all a virtual reality scenario too? That just opens a whole 'nother can of worms!For me, this just shows how the Wachowski Brothers are trying to aim for more of current marketing tastes rather than being bold enough to shoot for a more daring vision that would have pulled in an audience anyway, beings that the first Matrix was unique enough to attract all sorts of fans. As it is, Matrix Reloaded would have been more legitimate if it added a bit more ""story"" and focused a little less on extended fight scenes (after a while, that first major fight started to resemble a playground hand-slap game of ""Say Say Oh Playmate,"" just more violent). Notice how that courtyard fight scene went on and ON, then all of a sudden the hero just decides to fly up in the air and get away. Hmmmm.... couldn't he have just done that immediately to avoid a fight? OHHHH, I forgot, then we wouldn't get treated to all those cool visual effects....Yes, I was entertained. I was just basically disappointed to an extent as well. Films don't have to be completely ""meaningful"" but I think that the Wachowski's weren't trying hard enough to attempt something in that direction, especially with that budget.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Sure the special effects were there in force but they were so overdone.  The entire film lacked the congealed feeling of the original and I am now convinced that it was a very bad idea for the second and third installments to be made at all. The first was an instant classic while the second was just....kind of weak.The thing that ruined the whole movie was the Roman orgy based, hedonistic, sex fest rave scene that came completely out of nowhere.  What exactly was the point of this being in the film?  Perhaps to market some cheesy ass sell-out Paul Oakenfold tune while seeing women's nipples and their legs wrapped around guy's crotches?  TASTELESS.  Why does every depiction of a rave on camera have to embellish it to the point of it being unreal?  Have these people ever been to a party/rave before?  I also loved how everyone was in the best shape possible.  All these monkey like males jumping up and down as high as they can go ripped to shreds with muscles.  Where was the Zion gym?  I didn't see it.  Pathetic.  I also couldn't understand why we had to take a Virtual Reality trip up some woman's vagina.  I lost quite a bit of respect for the Wachowski brothers after seeing that.I have to give some credit to the freeway scene.  It was pretty spectacular. I really liked the ghosts and was puzzled as to why they weren't in the film more.  The scene in the park on the playground was also decent.  The CG was terrible at some points though and Neo didn't even look like himself in the face a few times.  The scene in the French guy's mansion was awful too. What's with all the slow-mo in this installment?  How many times do we need to see Morpheus and Trinity doing their Karate Kid airwalk?  Neo's Superman abilities were milked to the extreme.  Seeing him do that once was enough for me.Overall this is a 3/5 for lack of innovation and inspiration and for not carrying the film to the level it should have been after waiting so long for its release.  Oh yeah...and I needed a pillow for about the first 45 minutes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Besides, the sheer possibility of giving away details is too great.  What I can do is suggest that if you have not seen the first Matrix, don't bother with this one yet.  I've known two people who inexplicably went to see this film without seeing the original and disliked it greatly.  Until I saw it for myself, I couldn't understand how they could dislike the film, even as a stand-alone entity  the answer was apparent within the first 10 minutes.  The Wachowski brothers don't insult us and waste 20 minutes rehashing the complicated plot of the first film, rather they continue right along where the former ended.The first time I saw the original Matrix, I walked out of the theater with my friend who asked me what I thought of it.  Answering quite honestly, I replied with, `I have no idea what this film was about, but it was really f-ing cool.'  Of course, with a repeat viewing the answers became a little clearer, and this film answers a few of the questions one may have carried over from the original.  Indeed, the film opens up new areas of confusion which will be presumably covered in the final installment.  Even as I walked out of the theater a little less confused this time, I still had the same comment to make: `It was really f---ing cool.'  I didn't expect to be as amazed this time as I was while watching the predecessor because at this point the effects that the Wachowski brothers pioneered are hackneyed, but I was pleasantly surprised at how fun and exciting the action sequences were. 
There's no point in commenting on the acting, as it the characters are fairly formulaic: Hero, Mentor, Love Interest, Villain(s), and none of the roles are a stretch.  If I had to comment on the acting, I would have to say that I at least wasn't irritated by Keanu Reeves, who has the acting ability of a 12 year old community theater hopeful.  The best way to approach the film is as an interesting science fiction piece with plenty of incredible action sequences.  I have heard a minimum of 12 theories as to what everything in the second film means, but I think I'm going to choose not to overanalyze the film and simply enjoy it.  And if you haven't seen the first Matrix but decide to see this one, you can pretty much go to any video store, cable channel or even your next door neighbor and watch it before you see this one.  Or, don't bother:  If you didn't care to see the first one, you probably won't like this one, regardless of the hype.

Yes I thought the graphics and effects were absolutely killer, but I felt that the brothers got sloppy in the script department. A good movie, in my mind, is one that can stand alone. Even the middle volumes of other trilogies have done this (see Star Wars, and Godfather.) But I felt that this movie really lacked the consistency and immediacy of the first one. In this film it seems as if the brothers knew that everyone had seen the first, and so a rehash was unnecessary, and they figured that they were going to make a third, so they didn't feel a need to wrap up any ends. This to me is lazy writing that mars an otherwise killer film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There was no real plot that made you want to follow the story at all. Some of the dialogue was bad, and i didnt like the new actors much, some places with poor acting.all that aside, watching it for the special effects alone is a dream, everything from the fighting to the crash scenes are stunning!back to the movie, why does Neo have to fight the agents at all with his godlike powers, when he already knows they are a computer program and cant be killed? isnt that just a waste of time? Agent Smith is beginning to be a boring villain! I kinda liked the two white twins, something new and something better.The movie leaves open lots of questions after the last couple of scenes, but i guess that is part of the point. Im not excited with seeing the Matrix Revolutions later this year.And face it, the more you watch The Matrix the poorer the story gets, Keanu Reeves is a terrible actor.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Then we are taken on a fascinating ride along with Neo to discover the world is an illusion and machines now rule the planet. A very enjoyable film. By comparison the Matrix Reloaded is an fx driven kung-fu film that fails to inspire or entertain. Character and story development are thrown out the window and we are given endless fight scenes, back flips, and bullet dodging.Neo's powers have now developed soooooo much that none of the bad guys can lay a glove on him. The agents so feared in the first film are reduced to cannon fodder for Neo and his buddies to chew up and spit out. The film also lacked interesting side characters like Cipher, Dozer and Mouse. Every character we see in this film is a trendy dark clad sunglass wearing superhero. In fact the Humans are so cool and so powerfull you have to wounder how the machines manage to stay in control at all.Despite some enjoyable fx and gunfights the Matrix Reloaded is little more than a glorified kung-fu movie and no amount of coolness or trendy sunglasses can hide that glaring fact.4 out of 10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Pretty hard to do, considering that the first Matrix blew me away when I originally saw it -- and still blew me away upon repeated viewings of it. Hard shoes to fill.My lowered expectations, however, didn't prepare me for this: a movie that ranks right up there with the first sequel in the Back to The Future trilogy in the department of missed opportunities.What do both movies share? A confused, muddled plot. Line upon line of mumbo-jumbo bafflegab, even moreso than the original. And, oh yeah, the words ""to be concluded ... "" followed by a trailer for the next installment. (Though, you'll have to sit through the credits to see it in Matrix Reloaded.)That said, there are a few cool things about the reloaded Matrix. Yeah, the special effects were cool. Yeah, Ms. Moss is still as sexy as ever. But not only is this Matrix half the movie that the first one is, you can say it's half a movie. The story *is not* even remotely as self-contained as, say, Empire Strikes Back's or even X-Men 2's -- both of which, by the way, ended in cliffhangers. I suspect that not only will you have to see the upcoming Revelations in order to finally ""get"" a lot of what's going on here, but you might have to buy the Animatrix shorts on DVD and play the Enter The Matrix video game in order to figure out who is who and what their backstory is. If so, that is *not* a stroke of genius story telling. It's sloppy. And it's a cash grab. And I won't be party to it, that's for sure.Based upon the road kill I saw earlier this afternoon, I'm not sure if I'll be first in line for the Matrix Part 2 Part 2 this fall. Taking a cue from the first movie's reality vs. unreality mind games, I'm tempted to pretend that this sequel, at least, doesn't exist.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, its thunder and glory was ultimately stolen by a film that was being touted as just another typical sci-fi tale. Nevertheless, that films state-of-the-art effects, storyline and action were all that anyone could talk about, and has led to a new film trilogy being born. The second part of the trilogy, like the first, is set to knock all competition to the curb. We pick up the action a short time after its predecessor, with the population of Zion believing that Neo will help rid them of the machines and save the human race forever. However, news soon filters through that the machines have finally located Zion, and will have annihilated the human race within hours. So, Neo, Morpheus, Trinity lead a small group to discover how The Matrix can be destroyed. Their first stop is Neo's second visit to The Oracle, who tells him of a significant ally he must find: The Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim), who holds several thousands of keys important to the composition of The Matrix. However, he is being held by maniac Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) and his wife (Monica Bellucci) who refuses to release him at all costs. The Keymaker's purpose: To lead Neo into the construct of the system and to the Architect (Helmut Bakaitis.) With his white hair and jargon-laden spiel, he tells Neo, in no short terms, that no matter how hard he tries, the machines will triumph once more. Oh, and Agent Smith (a criminally wasted Weaving) pops up again, this time with the ability to clone himself. Wonders never cease.Of course, the action and SFX is like nothing you have ever seen before. Throughout the film, we are treated to awe-inspiring special effects, some of the finest you may ever see - the much-hyped freeway scene being the pick of the bunch. However, some of the set pieces drag horribly, and overdo the measured nature of the original. The films big downfall though is the narrative. Whereas the first's simple yet effective exposition was expertly calculated, Revolutions' is saturated in largely superfluous dialogue, with the majority of the story laden with psychoanalytical and religious undertones, and the directors' insistence on filling up the story with dodgy dialogue, which leaves the viewer bewildered and dazed. Acting wise, it is Fishburne and the superb Moss who are the saving graces, both exerting panache and charisma, despite playing second fiddle to Reeves, who, sadly, is as wooden and one-dimensional as ever. Weaving and Pinkett-Smith are also effective, but are both enormously underused. The directing is on autopilot throughout, with the Wachowski's exerting enough flair and panache to keep everyone happy.""Revolutions"" does exactly what it says on the tin for the most part, entertaining, engaging and stylish, but its overindulgence in clunky dialogue and shoddy plotting may make even one viewing of this film one too many.  ***","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Sadly, Reloaded feels more like a mishmash than a merging of genres.  More importantly, it's not very *fun*.Whereas Matrix 1 focused on Neo's awakening, the first half hour of the movie concerns itself with the mythical Zion -- the city of lost humans we heard about, but did not see, in ""The Matrix"".  Zion is much better imagined than seen; it looks like a poor Star Wars copy.  We are introduced to a parade of folks, setting us up for Matrix III, including the weirdest cameo of the year: African-American studies professor Cornell West as a Zion magistrate.After meeting scores of folks, we (thankfully) end up back in the matrix where Neo can fly, Trinity has learned to manipulate gravity, and fight scenes look, for better and worse, straight from a video game.  Of the matrix is the most interesting compelling part of these movies -- it's the very reason that our heros can do this cool stuff -- and there's plenty of interesting eye candy.  However, even some of the rules of the world are bent in the interest of ""plot"" and sadly, the characters lives, wills, and humanity ultimately mean less to the outcome of the film than how they can *manipulate* the computer code.What I loved about ""The Matrix"" is that it was shocking, provocative, and challenging.  ""Reloaded"" is composed of too many ideas warmed-over -- after every fight sequence a new character is introduced to explain the MEANING of some aspect of the movie.  It's like the filmmakers made up characters to act as Cliff Notes in case the audience missed the point they were trying so hard to make.  Not that I have anything against MEANING, rather I prefer, like Neo in ""The Matrix,"" to discover it myself.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Two movies in Matrix fans care about unveiling the truth of reality, but Matrix ended up being a cult because the generation that did care about the franchise failed to translate the context thereof to an audience who never held a grudge to the system to begin with. Much like one generation having remembered never carrying their phones expected to be home early anyway while the younger having been brought up by a computer, the former tells themselves they're stronger and smarter and better than the latter having experiences what life was like before technology, while younger audiences has no concern of opinion outside their perceived safety and comfort.

While the special effects were excellent, as a MOVIE, it stunk.  The plot is simply not credible; the ""climactic"" encounter between Neo and the Architect is ludicrous.  Given the premise that led Neo to that room, it is absurd to think that he would be let go again.  To think that Zion had been destroyed and rebuilt six times is similarly impossible to accept, given the age and enormity of the edifice, and the premise underlying the entire series -- the earth is no longer a land of plenty.  Unless the motivation of the Matrix makes sense, nothing in the movie is believable.  Thus, despite some great characters (the twin albinos; the keymaker; agent Smith) and one of the greatest fight scenes and car chases ever filmed, the movie lost me early and never came to life.  The slow pace of the first hour didn't help, either.  And finally, I really despised the ""ending.""  It reminded me of the Saturday morning cliffhangers I saw as a kid.  A desperate attempt to draw an audience for part III?  I hope it doesn't work.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's a cause this movie, there's no way to say that this movie was made, written and directed by the same people who made the first movie, this movie is just a mess of boring dialogue that tries to be interesting, don't waste your time.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The makers realising the enormous potential of the huge hit decided there was more money to be made and worked out some ill-conceived plot, offcourse nobody knows what it is, you have to watch The Matrix Revolutions to find out, which goes by the name of The Matrix Reloaded. Offcourse every Matrix fan is going to go back to the theatres to see the second helping of Matrix (just like i did) and because this movie leaves you in limbo you have to go back and see the Matrix Revolutions to see what it is all about anyway.It might well turn out that the second part of Matrix (which has been split into 2 movies as reloaded & revolutions) has a tight plot and great fun, but frankly i am quite dismayed at the fruitlessness of this movie. extremely disappointing and disingenious way of ripping off the hard-earned bucks off the matrix fans.shame on you guys!the movie in itself offers a glimpse of a plot which hopefully will be 'unraveled' in revolutions. the action scenes were boring and repetitive, honestly i was quite tired of the multiple agent smith stunt scenes. pointless. monica bellucci is the real payoff, she looks devastatingly beautiful. and offcourse we are going to believe that hte episode with her was there for a real reason, whether it is true or not we will know come december. the highway stunt scene was the only bit of excitement in the movie. stil the movie had enough going for it, just wish that reloaded n revolutions was put together in one movie so i wasnt getting ripped off.a disgraceful 5!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Self-righteous, hyped, and overrated, but in the end, an average flick","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0705124/?ref_=tt_urv","bkam","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1856997/?ref_=tt_urv","12 July 2003","This film fails to top the original, and that film did not particularly impress me in the first place.  This second attempt at a fusion of fighting and philosophy ends up being a confusing blend of pseudo-intellectualism, blatant and stupid symbols, and aesthetic but unsatisfying action.  The plot itself is somewhat directionless, meandering from place to place in search of action and ""answers"" without really finding anything.  This is not aided by the acting; at the start of the film, upon seeing Neo, a friend humorously and correctly predicted that Keanu Reeves would keep the same expression the entire movie.  Morpheus' lines are worse than in the original, and Lawrence Fishburne does a worse job with them.  The failed attempts at presenting a meaningful look at the dichotomy between man and machine are brought out in the early scenes, making the first half of the movie not only slow but pointless.  Enter Councilor Hamann looking like the Wizard of Oz to waste ten minutes with such insights as ""Some machines are bad; others are good.""  The irony is his own realization that for all his speaking he made no point; unfortunately, this insight was lost on those who could have removed the pointless scene from the movie.While the supporting characters are somewhat acceptable, the Architect takes the cake as one of the worst characters I've seen onscreen.  Purporting to be the knowledgeable authority with answers to Neo's questions, he simply presents a line of inconsequential jargon that leaves the audience universally dumbfounded.  For a large majority of the people to whom I spoke, they simply didn't understand what he is saying, so beset is it with laughable stabs at intelligent vocabulary.  For another group, however, his message is easily understandable, but to these the character appears even more ridiculous, for they realize how utterly devoid of meaning is everything he says.  Transforming even the simplest idea into a forty-second oration of crap, the Architect manages to use more words more incorrectly than I have ever heard in a major motion picture.  His odious presence in the film is surely one of its greatest handicaps, since he is central to Neo's mission (and thus the plot).  His speeches, as well as many others in this poor, confused film speak volumes of the problems with popularity. It is almost as if the masses saw the first Matrix, said, ""Wow, that's deep!"" The Wachowski brothers then looked at each other, shrugged, and said, ""Why not deeper?"" and dove into a whole world of convoluted casuistry.That said, the cinematography, score, and action are all acceptable-for an action movie.  If one enters expecting not true cinema, but rather some special effects more or less rammed down one's throat, it is somewhat bearable.  In the end, the film is rather average.  However, while most average films are not above poking fun at themselves, The Matrix remains self-righteous for its duration, and in taking itself so seriously it proceeds to do itself more harm than good.  Go in to see some expensive CG which is in some parts actually worse than the effects of the first (Neo looks like a pixel-y video game character in many of the scenes) and you may or may not be entertained.

Moreover, I don't understand why the Matrix can't be accessed from Zion. In the first movie, the location of Zion had to be kept secret from the machines. In this movie, the machines know the location of the city, so why not just access the Matrix from there?This is just the first part of a 4-hour movie.

About 15 minutes into it i was asked how i rated the movie so far. i said about 2, then i saw that underground clubbing scene (right after morpheus' horrible non-inspirational speech), you know, the dance party in zion, and i halved my score. The movie was lucky to receive a 4 in the end. The only things saving it being that mad french man, the orgasmic cake and the crazy bike scene. The fight scene with the 100 agent smith's just went on and on, if i wanted to see karate, i would hire out a jackie chan film... because at least he knows when to stop. If i wanted to see a giant party, i would have gone to a club. Bullet time was used far too much in this film too, thus making it crap. And the movie was not paced well. I wanted to fall asleep towards the middle. I rated this movie on par with ""Bulletproof Monk"" - aptly described as the best one star film of the year in some magazine. The philosophical babble was overdone in parts too. The first move was brilliant, but ""Reloaded"" was a shocker. Even the title sounded a bit corny. I'm sure ""Revolutions"" will be better though, because it won't be hard to beat this film, but i doubt it will be as good as the first movie. I don't think the third movie can really be a loser. If it is good, it will allow the series to remain credible, and if it is a flop, well, at least we know that the saga is over...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

His wooden performance is perfect for a film with more CGI than story. The film is a convoluted and shallow mess. I had been eagerly anticipating this film ever since ""The Matrix"" was first released, but now that I've seen it I couldn't be more disappointed. Are nth-degree choreographed fight scenes and high-tech chases now regarded as all that is necessary to make the audience sit still for a couple of hours? Hollywood seems to think so.  Shame on us for accepting explosions and Kung Fu as a substitute for a coherent story.  ""The Matrix"" told a mind-bending story of reality vs. fantasy and created an alternative universe that was fertile for plot and character development and internally consistent. ""Reloaded"" is more mind-numbing than mind-bending, and makes no pretense to take the audience into a alternative, yet believable, alternative reality. The plot holes are big enough to swallow a multiplex. Suspension of disbelief is strained beyond the breaking point. How is it that this movie is popular yet no one in it is actually acting? Each character speaks as if they're overdosing on Valium. None of the characters show that they feel the weight of what is supposedly at stake. ""Matrix Reloaded"" is like giving a starving person a bathtub full of very weak tea. It's too much of not enough.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Every action scene seems twice as long as it should be. The CGI looked as phony as the new Star Wars movies, where you can actually see the stars' faces superimposed over digital bodies. Then when the folks of Zion started gyrating and humping to techno music while Neo and his babe made out, I had to laugh. It was right out of the 10 Commandments orgy sequence. All the Zion stuff looked like Star Trek meets Waterworld, and all the gratuitous action stuff looked like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, like the Bad Boys II trailer we saw before the film even started. And the story? What story? That's what made the first Matrix stand out - Neo's journey from hacker to hero. Here it's all about how cool the phony CGI looks while the characters pose in sunglasses. What a complete mess. The fact that it was so boring adds insult to injury.

Granted, the film had a unique look to it and became heavily imitated and parodied.  But I found it to be rather pretentious in its intentions.  After viewing THE MATRIX RELOADED, all I've got to say is:  It's more of the same and not too different.  Keanu Reeves returns as Neo, the one chosen to free humanity from the enslavement of machines that are feeding off of it for power.  As before, the machines have set up defenses in the form of the reality-altering Agents led by the ever soulless Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who now has the power to multiply himself by jamming his fingers into a person's chest and turning them into a replica.  The relationship between Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) is now deepened to the point where they have a sex scene while the citizens of Zion, the last city of humans, dance in mud like an underground version of ""Soul Train"".  Reeves, Moss, Weaving and Laurence Fishburne, as Morpheus, all return from the first movie.  They are joined by Harold Perrineau as the new pilot of the Nebuchadnezzar with Nona Gaye (taking over for the late Aaliyah) as his wife.  There is also Monica Bellucci as a mystery woman who may or may not be quite on the heroes' side, Jada Pinkett-Smith as Niobe, another ship captain who had a relationship with Morpheus but is now involved with one of Zion's city leaders (Harry Lennix).    As with the first film, the stunt work and special effects are dazzling to the eye.  An opening sequence showing Trinity being chased in a freefall by Agents has to be seen to be believed as bullets (and bodies) literally go flying across the screen.  However, as with the first film, the story seems to be a little full of itself.  I understand that there are quite a lot of religious references in the MATRIX movies, but I find them to stand out like a sore thumb.  Maybe my atheism makes them go over my head.  Perhaps this movie seems so spare because it is the second in a planned trilogy.  Maybe that will make everything crystal clear when it ends.  Maybe they'll also explain why nearly everyone is wearing dark glasses when there's precious little sunlight in the movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Then at the beginning of this film we basically have Neo, Morpheus and co. walking around the Matrix doing exactly the same thing as before, yest never showing the people in the Matrix that they live in the Matrix.  In the first film Morpheus didn't stand a chance against an agent.  Now, he can kick there asses with little difficulty.  The kung fu was completely pointless, because Neo was always fighting people for no reason.  Check out the scene where they are Neo and co. are trying to get the Keymaster away from the French guy.  If Keanu had a brain he would realise that: A. He doesn't need to fight these stock Joel Silver heavies and B. He could just fly away with the Keymaster and we wouldn't need this stupid freeway chase which could lead to the destruction of mankind.

This movie ambles aimlessly from a summer-school reading of the Meditations, to a shameless Plantinga rip-off, to Pascal's wager, to god-only-knows what other misinterpretation the Wachowski brothers remember from their PHI 101 days.

In the end I wasn't interested in the main characters, except for Mr Smith. Now he's a cool & detached character. Holds back some. That's interesting.Dunno if I'll even bother with Matrix III. Not to be compared with 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy where No 2 was as good as the first film and I eagerly await the last film.Pity. I can only give this film 2/5 or 4/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Its special effects alone have paved the way for future films and its original concepts were intriguing and engrossing.  How do you top a film like that?  Quite simply, I don't think you can.Okay, so the Matrix Reloaded isn't what I expected.  I had purposefully prepared myself for it to be a little worse than the first.  I WASN'T expecting this.Sure, the effects were as brilliant as ever, but I can't help feeling that it was really lacking something.  The entire story was very hard to follow. Some points are made in extreme detail yet other crucial factors are not spoken of (or perhaps they were and just got drowned out in the continual and overdone monologues?).  The fight sequences are superb, but the slow-motioned martial arts really started to draw on my nerves.  Neo's ""superman"" abilities also were far too corny.  Perhaps they were done this way on purpose?  And am I the only that feels like the whole Xion rave party/love scene was totally unnecessary?  That ten minutes would have been better spent on... ANYTHING else.In it's favour, I must say that the Twins scenes are fantastic.  I don't have enough praise for the short time these characters are in the film. Excellent.  Hugo Weaving, as always, is excellent as Agent Smith.  His character's dry humour made the movie a lot more enjoyable.I found it very hard to sit through the Matrix Reloaded.  It just seemed to drag on and on to me.  For all it's worth, it's still a great movie. Visually, it is stunning.  On another level though, I couldn't stand it. I know fans will be disappointed with my opinion of this film.See it and make your own decision.  I know my friends and I are all hotly divided.  5 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The introduction of so many characters continued the confusion.  None of the new characters were fleshed out very well.  I will say, the freeway chase was well done.

The special effects blew my mind, and the philosophical content of the story was compelling.  All told, there had never been an action film quite like it, and I was more than willing to endure the headache of seeing a blockbuster movie the day it came out.Wow, was I ever disappointed.For anyone who said this was an exciting movie: were you watching the same film I was???  Rarely has anything less exciting been imprinted onto celuloid.  After about 90 minutes, I was checking my watch every five.Firstly, the plot is incredibly half baked, and the philisophical content of Reloaded was lame.  The first Matrix film was an allegory for contemporary existence, in which we struggle for individual identity and real freedom, as opposed to the mere illusion of the same.  With Reloaded, they flip-flop and, instead of addressing the control our social orders have on us, there's a thoroughly uninteresting discussion of predeterminism.  The ""ending"" (if you can call it that) flip-flops a second time, but not in any way that gives you much hope for the third installment.Secondly, the effects in this movie were NOT that special.  The CGI was heavy-handed, all of those slow-mo, speed up effects were enormously overused, and everything has the feeling of ""look what we can do.""  It's as if the directors got together and said, ""Okay let's make a movie in which most of the scenes tell the story, and then we'll just throw some perfunctory scenes in for the special effects geeks out there.""  Arguably, the Lord of the Rings series blows out of the water anything in Reloaded. We're talking superior by an order of magnitude.In sum, Matrix Reloaded was a mind-boggling waste of my time and money. Why not stay home, actually spend time with your children, make love to your romantic counterpart, walk your dog, listen to your favorite album, or watch the NBA playoffs instead?3/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I know that so many times there are always those who knock a sequel simply for being a sequel, and having shortcomings that the previous movie lacked. This movie, however, was more like Star Wars Episode I, than the sequel to the Matrix. Like Episode I, there were exceptionally neat action sequences, special effects, and a few choice lines.  The rest of the script, and dialogue ran as if someone wanted to write a movie with a twist every fifteen minutes, far too many undefined characters, and dialogue that moved like a dog chasing it's own tail.  I can only hope that the next one will be much more impressive and entertaining.  The first Matrix was exceptional, but Reloaded was like a biblical movie, set up like star wars, with an all gothic cast. The highway chase was of course, extremely good. I hope everyone else enjoyed it more than I did. -MLM","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first film left this series absolutely no where to go. The first film ends with Neo discovering his Superman-like abilities.  So unless the writing is very creative and villians as badass as the hero, you will have a boring ass movie.  There is no tension in any action scene involving Neo.  He is indestructable, unphaseable and over all emotionally uninteresting.  Why do any of the Matrix programs even bother to fight him? The uninteresting little dramas involving Neo aside, the film is still crap because there is nothing interesting to say or do. The movie tries to disguise the fact that it has nothing to do with a lot of action. I mean a lot of action.  Did I mention there is a lot of action in this movie.  Well there is so much action in M2 that it makes the film boring.  Can you imagine that?  Much of the action is pointless as are many of the f/x shots.  It is really quite shocking that the Wachoski bros, who did so well in the first matrix, missed the boat so badly.  They have forgotten if they ever knew, that fight scenes and special effects are only important if they move the story along, if they actually add to the story. In M2 they just act as filler, disguising the fact there is really nothing at all to the Matrix.  What a disappointment.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Most of the movie is filler comprised of dull exposition and fight scenes which, while visually spectacular, are pointless because they don't serve to advance the storyline very much. Matrix Reloaded comes off like the most expensive video game commercial ever made. We are introduced to a few new characters, but they're never developed to the point where we might actually care about what happens to them. The dialog is so stilted it deserves to be in a Star Wars sequel. The love scenes between Neo and Trinity are so devoid of chemistry and irrelevant to the plot that I felt embarrassed for the actors. Granted, the first Matrix was a hard act to follow. But Reloaded should have been better. Part of the problem with this bloated cinematic dud has to do with what I call the Harry Potter Syndrome. It happens when the protagonist is omnipotent and can arbitrarily conjur up an infinite variety of superhuman gimmicks to defeat any possible threat. The result is the dramatic tension is so undermined that the story becomes an exercise in tedium. Neo is already a god in the Matrix, so there's never any real danger, never any risk. He'll always prevail because he's Neo and he can stop cyberbullets by holding up his hand. Wow. Excuse me while I snore. The story only starts to move along in the last 30 minutes, and then it's merely a setup for the cliffhanger ending. Matrix Reloaded is ultimately nothing more than two hours of stylish, brilliantly choreographed Hong Kong martial arts pastiche designed to keep us in our seats long enough so we can see the advertisement (also known as a trailer) for Matrix Revolutions after what have to be the world's longest credits. I wonder if it's too late to demand a refund...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I can barely stay awake through it, and that is unusual for me to say the least.  The movie plays like a video game, going from one level to another, fighting each and every time we hit a new level. I was not intrigued one bit by this unsuccessfully disguised action flick, unlike the first Matrix which I thought was terrific and thought provoking.  That's not to say the action wasn't really amazing - it was.  It was ballet in motion, and it is very interesting to see in slow mo how a hit is taken, how flips are completed, etc. But, the acting is stiff, the story very elementary and unworthy of the first movie, and to be perfectly frank, I didn't think that Carrie Ann Moss looked particularly good as she did in the first film. In fact, everyone looked older, more tired, and some actually looked a little unsure of themselves in their parts, as if following the directions and not owning the part.  Bad actors or bad direction, inadequate preparation or bad casting? Probably a combo of prep time and casting in most cases, and maybe there was so much concentration on the physicality of the film that the quiet, character building parts were forgotten. 
I hate to genderize this Matrix, but the first one to me appealed to all techno-geeks, gen x and y'ers, regardless of gender.  This one, as an almost pure action flick, seemed to me to be very male oriented in a sense.  That's just too bad, as the first held so much hope and currency.

What a waste of time and money.  This movie has virtually nothing going for it. I've read how great the fight scenes are.  I thought they were way too long, there were way too many, and for all the money they spent on special effects, they were obviously CGI.  I've seen video games with better CGI.The ""philosophical"" element to the story is vastly overstated.  This same theme (are we in reality or living inside someone/something else's dream/reality/virtual reality) has been handled with far more insight and thought in many other places (especially in literature) - heck, even in the original movie it was better and Matrix wasn't particularly good (but better than this).  This was not ""deep"" or particularly insightful either. Somehow many people were confused by the interaction with the Architect. Um, Neo makes one of 2 choices - whoopie!Primairly the movie seemed an excuse to do more CGI and capitalize, read ""make money,"" as a sequel to a big money original.  The story went nowhere.  The whole ""plot"" could have been quickly and efficiently handled in about 15 minutes literally.  Grass grows faster than the plot progresses, what little plot there is.
The acting is also poor - Keanu does his best ""brooding"" performance which always comes off as being stoned or constipated.  He should have ended his ""acting"" career after ""Bill and Ted.""  The remainder of the cast isn't worth talking about - even if they are better actors, the script gave them nothing to work with.   I never felt the human characters were as ""scared"" as they kept claiming they were.
Blech!  This is not sci-fi and sure as hell isn't science fiction - this is special effects for the sake of making money.  Even then, the SFX went on way too long to get any enjoyment of that.  How many times can one watch Keanu do his limited ""kung fu"" action or leap through the air the same ol' way he's done 400000 times before?You couldn't pay me to sit through this stinker again.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film starts with a teaser action sequence, of about 20 seconds in length.  Then there's a lot of nonsensical,unconvincing, rather perfunctory dialogue.  Then another quick teaser of an action sequence involving Neo vs. a trio of agents, about 60 seconds long.  Then more dialogue ensues.  The theater was becoming an antsy assemblage, as people were shifting in their stadium seating, brushing back their hair, suddenly becoming itchy everywhere, as boring discussions between council members and secondary characters stagnated the story into neutral.  Then Neo meets with the Oracle in a courtyard, for a final blast of superfluous chatter, and finally--hurray hurrah--Agt. Smith appears and things get cool. It's what everyone was waiting for.  Neo kicks some serious backside against the flock of Smiths (lesser known music collaboration of the 1980s reference there).  As if the directors knew that this was what everyone was waiting for, some intense, throbbing electronic music shirs energetically in the background during the sequence, and we have ten minutes of ecstasy. Then more dialgoue, more, more, still more, then action with music again, the process as here indicated repeating several times 'til the flick finally ends.  Can we see how this is resembling a porno film?  Filler-style story that's boring and serves only to drive the characters to ""action"" (sex) scenes, enhanced by the  accompaniment of mood music.
What baffles me most about ""TMR"" is the grueling efforts made by the screenwriters to leave the audience so entirely nonplused--the first film has so much entertaining stuff to it--we watch neo discover his powers, train, choose his pills, get stronger, meet people--it's like we're discovering the new world with him.

As a politically correct Superman comics, it might be somewhat entertaining. ""The Matrix"" it sure isn't.The movie meandered back and forth into avenues that had little to do with the premise of the movie. It couldn't really decide what its mission was. The cinematography was cartoonish compared to the first one, and the ending, well, it was predictable, but in view of the rest of the movie, it wasn't bad or good, it just was. Also, in the first move one identified with the human colony, it was a clear struggle for survival. There was something noble and mysterious about that struggle. In this one, after the whole pointless plot with Zion, the ""bang-the-drums-and-start-the-fires"" dance orgy, and the conflict between the captains (what exactly was this whole subplot for, anyone knows?), I couldn't really decide who I wanted to win. Once you lose the emotional attachment to the heroes, you lose the audience. I am not sure I will bother to see the third one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That sequels can work and not be worse than their counterparts has been demonstrated by the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy and ""Kill Bill"". That sequels sometimes do not work at all, on the other side, is shown quite impressively by the ""Matrix"" trilogy.Seriously, what were they thinking? 'Well, we are out of ideas, but the first one was a big box office success, so we simple *have* to do a sequel!'? Well, it has had to be something like this, otherwise I cannot understand why they released this pile of horse droppings.Okay, the special effects are again quite nice, although there are scenes where you can see quite clearly that it is all mainly CG. The ""wow"" effect is gone, of course, and we do not see much that is genuinely new. So, from the ""eye candy"" point of view, this sequel does not add much.Story-wise it is even worse. We see lots of new characters, mainly inside the Matrix. All this seems like a zoo of some sorts, because not one of these characters is actually important or unique. They are just bizarre, and form the setting for a string of (albeit impressive) action scenes.And this is what is left of the first ""Matrix"": an uninteresting action flick. No philosophical reflexion, no unanswered questions anymore. Everything that made ""The Matrix"" interesting has vanished here, being replaced by a simple ""good vs. bad"" theme. And after a (too) long series of fight and flight sequences it simply... stops.Yes, the second and third part of the ""Matrix"" should more likely be one long film rather than two separate installments. The ending of this part (if it can be called that) is quite unsatisfying: one simply is left hanging in thin air. Upshot: very disappointing.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

When it started I thought that this was going to be the best film ever. However, I got very bored as the first hour dragged on forever. When the action started, I thought 'finally here we go', but the fight scenes dragged on too long and to be quite frank, the effects in the Neo vs. the hundred Agent Smiths scene were awful. Half the time, Neo looked like plastic. It was actually a relief when the scene finished. However, the twins were fantastic and the highway scene was spectacular, it's a shame the rest of the film couldn't have been as good as this. Plus parts of the movie were REALLY confusing. I won't go into it, but anyone who has seen the movie will know what I'm talking about. I think the problem with the Matrix Reloaded is that we've seen it all before.

Sure enough, it's every bit as bad as the first one and then some! But, you all have probably guessed that already. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" has a stupid and poorly paced story, the acting is mediocre and most of the special effects have not aged well. The plot is, Neo, Trinity and Morpheus continue their warfare against the Machine Army, while utilizing their arsenal of extraordinary skills and weaponry. Even just describing the story is boring! I'll tell you one thing, boring synopses will almost always result in lackluster films. To tell you the truth, the word ""boring"" is an understatement to describe this ""movie""! It's essentially just a rehash of the first one, except with Shakespearean references. Yeah, because he was such a strong influence in the first film, or lack thereof. This is one of the most dull science-fiction/action movies I've seen. It's like they took the script from the first one, and just alter it a bit. Talk about lazy! Film Making 101: if you're looking to write a sequel script, make sure it has it's own unique premise. Now, you can have callbacks to the first movie. But, just a re-telling is completely unnecessary. If you're going to do that, then you have to be an expert! There are very few film sequels that pull off the same premise flawlessly. A perfect example, is ""Home Alone 2: Lost in New York"" (1992). That movie is essentially the same exact plot as the first one, except for a few alterations. Now, that being said, it brought a whole new fresh take on it's re-telling. Like I said many times before, all films and TV shows are just recycled plot threads. The key, is to add your own fresh twist to the already exploited storyline. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is the epitome of lazy storytelling. Come on, we've seen it already! Hasn't the audience suffered enough? As for the acting, it's just as big a letdown as the plot itself. The only ones who appear to be trying are: Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne. Everyone else in the cast just looks bored and falls flat! As far as special effects go, most of them are better this time around. But, there are a good handful of them that have not aged well at all. Just like in the first movie, this one has unnecessary slow motion and stylized action scenes. Due to that fact, the cheapness of the special effects really shines! The sets/locations are great and they give the movie a decent atmosphere. Finally, the soundtrack is actually pretty well-done. It's such a shame that it amounts to nothing and is tied to such a poorly made ""film""! ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is another pointless sequel that no one asked for. Yet, for some reason, it was made any way. All I have to say is, WHY?! I'm struggling to give this ""film"" a 2 out of 5 star rating, which equates to 4 out of 10 stars. Do I really have to tell you to stay away from this worthless ""movie""? Let me tell you something, the title, ""Reloaded"", is a strong factor that will result in viewing this ""film"". You will want to reload immediately. But, it won't be weapons that'll be reloaded, it'll be your drinking glasses. Keep in mind, I don't drink any alcoholic beverages, never have, never will. However, if you watch ""The Matrix Reloaded"", it may drive you to drink!","0 out of 10 found this helpful.

It has since found regular rotation in my DVD collection.   In 1999 audiences were blown away by thought provoking plot, the cutting edge special effects, dark foreboding cinematography, and the gritty hard core score.  The Matrix has rightfully earned a spot in cinematic history.But that was 1999.  Today the movie's ground breaking special effects are seen in cereal commercials and TV shows.  Hare core music is now so closely associated with darker cinema and television that it has almost become passé. Even the wildly exaggerated physical feats have shown up in other cinema such as in 2000 with Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.Since hearing of the even possibility of a sequel I've been eagerly awaiting where the Wachowski brothers were going to take Neo next.  Viewing their uniquely bizarre 1996 movie Bound only fueled my desire, because they proved that they could get great results from actors as well as CGI.  I was now ready for cinema to be taken to another level.If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, what the Wachowski brothers have done with Matrix Reloaded is just flatter themselves.  The 138 minute long feature should have been called Matrix Exaggerated, because that is exactly what they have done.  The Matrix had several intense fight scenes, Reloaded more than quadrupled the number of fight sequences.  The Matrix had a quirky seemly out of place older character in the Oracle.  Reloaded added to that with the Keymaster.  The Matrix had Neo and Trinity's love affair.  Reloaded upped the ante Morpheus' love triangle and a new relationship between Link and his wife.Looking more like a setting and characters for a music video than humanities last holdout, the characters of Zion must have exhausted what was left of the brother's creative juices, because the best villain they could come up with is a character killed in the first movie.  Through a vague unrealistic plot twist Agent Smith has been reloaded, and reloaded, and reloaded and....  Other foes included two twins with such outrageous appearances that they drew laughs from the audience during a somewhat serious scene.  The dread-lock clan pair looked more like powered donuts than formidable opponents.Cadillac and Ducati must have more advertising dollars than Bell Helicopter because a car chase replaced the ariel sequence of the Matrix.  Or maybe they were just told you can't have a successful action film without a car chase. The overly drawn out chase has so many near misses that viewer's confidence that the heroes will make it removes the drama of the chase leaving only eye candy.What is the Matrix?  It might have been the question that drove Neo, but it was also what gave the original the narrative backbone to stand on.  As far as storytelling is concerned the only thing Reloaded is standing on is the Matrix's coattails.  Most of the budget must have gone to the actors, the special effect department, fight scene choreographers and the overly zealous costume designers, because not much attention was given to writing a good script.I can only imagine what pressure the Wachowski brothers must have been under to follow up the critical and financial success of the Matrix, and I was so ready to enjoy the fruits of their effort.  I went to the cinema to see movie magic, but after seeing The Matrix Reloaded all I came away with was Movie slight of hand.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Well, that goes double for this turkey. Watching it made me realize1) just how much of the enjoyability of the first Matrix came from the novelty of both the concept and the execution 2) that cynically tacking on a love story to appeal to the women who wouldn't like the straight action and/or science fiction of a guy flick is a surefire way to stop the momentum of your movie like a brick wall and ruin it for everybody (see also Star Wars II Attack of the Clones, compare to The Road Warrior's avoiding that error)3) that I do realize after all why some people don't like Keanu Reeves as an actor, after years of my defending him (weakly)4) that you can just switch elderly black women in the middle of a series when the last one whom you cast dies, and nobody will notice5) that we need a constitutional amendment banning insertion of a big community barn dance number in what should be a tense spare film about a small intense band trying to save humanity against enormous odds and constantly looking over their shoulders to see who's going to catch a bullet next so that maybe they can at least save their mission if not themselves.Big mistake, that whole 'Zion' concept.

Is it loud? Check. Plenty of special and visual effects? Double Check. Plenty of action? Check. Is it a great movie? No. But I enjoyed myself, never the less. I did not really like the beginning though. For some reason, it felt kind of forced, sparatic, it didnt work well at all. But as the movie went on, so did my approval rating. Some more editing would have been nice though, what I mean is that the fight scenes are to long. Like where Neo Battles five billion Agent Smith's in the courtyard, it was a great fight sequence, jaw dropping, and the stunts with the pole worked great, but it was too long, it started to get to the point that I was like, okay it can end anytime now. In my opinion it should have ended right before Smith said ""more"". This is no one time thing though, just about every fight last's a little bit to long. The freeway chase on the other hand, was long, but just about perfect. Jaw dropping from beginning to end. Even with the fight sequences running to long, they were impressive and fun to watch, I couldnt help but tell myself, okay, this is the best fight scene, only to be bested by the next one, ending up with the freeway chase being the best action scene in the movie. The dialogue and acting is okay, sometimes too long, and tries too hard to be all inspiring and mind bending and make you think, something a little too forced in this movie yet totally opposite in the first. My last complaint is the special effects, yes they are great, incredible and jaw dropping. But, wheres all the new stuff? Wheres all of the hyped up stuff that 'can never be copied like the stuff from the orignal was'? Sure, theres some new stuff, and the bullet time and slow mo effects are ten times better than they were in the original, but I saw nothing that jaw dropping or incredibly revolutionary like in te first one. But, aside from all these complaints, and I know, there are alot, I enjoyed this film, the cliffhanger was a cliffhanger, the effects were great effects (though nothing terribly new or completely revolutionary). The kung fu was great, the gun scenes were just as good, the storyline was great too. Though I had some complaints about the dialogue, it was okay as well. In the end, the story flies high (though not as much as the original) the special effects were amazing (but not as original as they were in the original) and the acting was worse that in the original (which wasnt that great to begin with). Though I was hoping to see what I saw in the original, in other words, things I had never seen nor been on screen before, considering how hyped this movie was, it lived up to it more than other hyped up movies, like the terrible Episode II. In the end, it may not be exactly what I expected, I had fun. *** out of ***** Low 8/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Reloaded tries to improve on the first movie by giving us more: bigger cities, larger crowds, longer fights, and larger numbers of retro television monitors, but more isn't more.  One scene epitomizing how more isn't more shows a horde of duplicate Agent Smith's fighting Neo (who, of course, has more super powers).  The agents look like so many ants scuttling across the screen; some of the audience were laughing.  The plot, so mindbendingly cohesive in the first movie, sprawls all over the place in this movie.  The metaphors of the phone as conduit, the 360º pan as transcendence over illusory reality, worked in the first movie because they were novel, resonated upon each other, and were introduced sparingly.  One example: the climax of the first movie was when Neo stopped several bullets, it cuts to Morpheus breathing ""He's the one"", and the soundtrack swells; in this movie, Neo stops several hundred bullets, and the reaction is, ok, on to the next fight scene, simultaneously boring the audience and cheapening the climatic scene of the first Matrix movie. And since Neo and his teammates always win when pitted against agents or Matrix denizens, there's no suspense anymore: you start to just wait for the fighting to be over.  The soundtrack, except for some transient effectiveness - it lifted up an otherwise pointless orgy scene to the level of not-all-that-bad pop video - lacked the tightness of the first movie's. There's no reason to add a sequel to the first Matrix movie.  For all its stunts, hard work, and stabs at developing forward, Matrix Reloaded is just Matrix Rehashed, and it cheapens the brilliance of the marvelous original.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Matrix 2 is very disappointing.  Why you might ask?  Well, it doesn't build on the first movie at all nor does it take advantage of the millions of plot devices and rich character development that was available from the first movie.  This is one of the first action movies I've truly been bored at.  The sequences appear to take tens of minutes and there is no meaningful resolution or plot advancement after these sequences.  The sheer ""coolness"" of the fight sequences are not as great as the first movie as all the technology we've seen before, there is nothing surprising at all.  The director and script writer really fail to follow the basic rules to script writing / movie making, which leads to a movie with little discernible story, dialogue which may have been a 1000 words at best.., and the ineffective use of nearly all the story telling principles including the use of suspense.  We are thrown into action sequence after action sequence, and although these hold some interest there is no suspension of belief at all.Maybe my expectations were too great after the first movie, but I really didn't expect a movie like this, especially with the budget that was spent. The ""hoorah-hoorah"" bike sequence that the crew kept advertising really falls short of the investment put in, a cataclysmic failure in capturing any sort of urgency at all.  The bike scene in T2 or the racing scene in Ronin were much better done.The lack of urgency in the entire movie, the lack of plot development or dialogue in general, and the repetitive fight scenes makes for a better Honk Kong action movie than an American theatrical release.  This is the first time I've seen a sequel which has in some way reduced the value of the original movie in my mind.  I will probably not watch the next movie in the theaters.  I recommend you go watch the movie once the crowds die down a bit, as no one person can really reflect everyone's notion of good film however X2 is definitely a better movie with a real story and an effective use of special effects and I expect T3 will also be much better.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was very disappointed. The stunts, special effects, and fighting scenes were identical to the original Matrix; nothing new.  The scenes with the sentinels in them looks like they were cut and pasted from the first Matrix.  Some of the scenes were so redundant and ridiculous, the only word I could use to sum it up is ""stupid"".  In one scene, Keanu spends 10 minutes fighting 100 agents.  It was very repetitive and boring; I actually yawned.  The fight scenes are definitely the most yawn inspiring; an exact mimic of the original Matrix. If I wanted to see the orginal Matrix movie, I could have stayed home and watched the DVD.On the plus side, there is a very long car chase scene which contained some great automobile special effects.  But even in all its glory, this scene was unecessarily lengthy and tried my patience.Overall, I would give the movie a ""C"", 2 out of 4 stars.  It's worth seeing, if only to compare notes with the Sci-fi geeks who are going to rave about it, but I would wait until DVD or video.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was excited to hear the squels were coming out. Then, on release my friends who saw the Matrix:Reloaded told me what a middle of the road movie it was. So, I pocketed my $9.50 and waited for the video release.I was so glad I did! Matrix:Reloaded is boring, full of plotholes, and inane. It was like watching one long videogame without much plot and I am sorry..I didn't rent a videogame...I rented a movie! I didn't buy the ""love"" between Trinty and Neo. They seemed bored with each other and the sex scene...well Trinty looked less than into Neo during it. So, when he brings her back after she is shot...I just yelled ""PLEASE!!!!"" I mean he saves Trinty, who seems bored with him,  over saving Zion...what a LAMER!
I also thought the scene where Neo flew and the shipmate (sorry forgot his name) said ""He is doing the Superman thing"" was beyond stupid. What? Neo flies now? Ummm yeah.The only sequence I enjoyed was the chase on the freeway. That was very impressive and made me watch the video twice...well this scene and my next head scratching moment.That moment would be....where the hell did ""The Kid"" come from and how doe she know Neo...I don't remember Neo saving him in the first Matrix movie so why does this kid say he did? What the hell happens to the spoon the kid gives Neo to give to the Oracle? I never saw him give it to her? Did he lie to the Kid about giving it to her?This film needed a lot of work to make it able to stand out there on it's own. I thought it just had a syndicated scifi-show feeling and the ""To Be Continued"" at the end stamped the feeling deep into my soul.I am now leery of watching Matrix: Revolutions....because I now it will tarnish the first movies greatness even further. I think the first movie should have been the only movie. Then we could have all imagined what happened....or at least the film-makers should have done a better job with the storyline instead of making it a long, boring, videogame.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie has a lot of action, yet it is a bore. How can one manage to do that? There is absolutely nothing extraordinary about this movie. I'm also appalled at the general lack of criticism. In other words, ""the movie is 100% the best of all time"" or something like that. I believe Jackson's Lord of the Rings suffered from the same problem. Anyway.I'll say it straight: The Matrix Reloaded displeased me first because of its mystical tangent. The first movie was interesting because you could share Neo's disbelief at the discovery of this ""real"" world, and how he learned progressively about it. As the ignorant audience, we began with presumptions and had to abandon them along the way as everything unfolded. I'm not talking about surprises per se, only something constructive; a real development, so to speak. I sincerely think there was one in the first movie, despite its flagrant weaknesses.A good point though is that the makers coherently, in my opinion, treated the idea of Myths. This is obvious in almost every scene, from religious faith to Superheroes. But somehow it didn't touch me. I liked better the more technological (almost cyberpunk) side of the first movie.On the philosophical side, Matrix Reloaded rates at the level of the schoolboy who's convinced he's got the Big Questions and has to Seek the Answers: as enthusiastic as idealistic, but alas shallow and empty. Taking yourself too seriously is a bad thing, because it eventually amounts to naivete. Making a philosophical movie doesn't require the actors to meet characters that need a definite article in their names to feel mythical (the Keymaker, the Architect, etc.) and so we have to think they got answers or whatever. It's one of the basic rules in writing anything seriously, movie or book: show don't tell. So there was lots of questions within stupid dialogues, and no treatment. Cheap philo, that was.Visual effects. Maybe this had to do with the fact that I was sitting in the second front row (I was really amazed to find out that most people had arrived several hours before, just like a Star Wars movie you're waiting for after 20 years; the Matrix never deserved such fanatism, in my opinion), but they often appeared less than average. Not counting the fact that you could spot Smith's or Neo's doubles too often for my taste.All in all, cool fights, some overlong sequences, bad philo, and a Neo, for whom the Matrix is no more a challenge, wandering around until he finally has something to do.Oh, the French guy was hilarious, but you have to understand French for the full impact to be felt.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Dont be ridiculous. This was the most pathetic movie of the year. All the people that are shoving optomistic reviews into this database are displaying completely irrational and incomprehensive opinions.
The boring, overloaded vocabulary and repetitive and extensive action scenes makes you wonder if the director even understands how brilliant the first movie was. Perhaps he didnt mean it to be so fantastic and complex. I mean, I had a fantastic theory made of the original matrix, and discussed it with other fellow matrix-dwellers, but now that I have seen the 2nd movie, I begin to doubt the intellectuality of the first movie.
The reason I question the directors ability to comprehend his own work is because most of the aspects that made me wonder and dream from the first movie where basically shut-out of the 2nd movie like they didnt exist. Perhaps this wasnt called Matrix-2 for a reason, perhaps its not even related! I wouldnt be too suprised.Actions scenes? Oh you mean the 500 replays of a punch, kick and glide performed by neo? Oh if thats what you mean by ""action-filled"" then yeah, it was ""action heaven"". I think the director assumed that Matrix was so so successful due to the slow motion kicks and slow bullets *bzzt* wrong. Sure some of us were completely breath-taken at the dazzling punches and kicks from the first movie, oblivious to the beauty of a plot that made spieldberg stare at his feet as they kicked dust like a 8 year old asking for candy, but most of us were searching for answers to the 1000's of questions formed by a community of loyal matrix fans, only to find a movie which spells shame.Like repetition isnt enough to make all matrix fans shiver in disgust, to top it off they had to be the most predictable action scenes I've seen as far as my memory goes back. Sure some movies like Tomb Raider could share the title of boredom with matrix reloaded, but is that something to be proud of? If you want more depth into my opinion, I'll give you your mental-fortune. The reaction to the movie will go something like this.Sweet moves! Damn that was close. OMG more sweet moves! yikes, almost as close as before. Huh, didnt i just watch that scene? Yeah, i knew that would happen. Oh, him again, braaaavoooo.... Ah there he is again, damn he didnt get shot this time. How much did I spend on this movie? Whats the time? When is the REAL matrix reloaded going to start?!? Thank god the movie ended just about there or sanity would have abandoned me.If you want beauty and class, or in other words you want Matrix, then rent it on dvd NOW! If you want Tomb Raider with slow motion, see Matrix Reloaded!Compared to Tomb Raider, I give this 10/10. Compared to Matrix, I could only give you a rating if it was out of a 1000, sorry .","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

My feelings are extremely mixed, but trying to in any way review this movie borders on the impossible due to its serial nature - about half a dozen plot lines are set up without any further payoff. Though I am dumbfounded by its lengthy scenes of Bert I. Godonesque exposition (back when film makers didn't worry about having to hold an audience) and goofy Anime-like plot, if I was to criticize them now I might have to seriously eat my words in November. Even so, it perhaps suffices to say that this is one of these annoying examples of a sequel that completely changes the rules and meaning of its predecessor (much like 2010: The Year We Made Contact retroactively altered 2001: A Space Odyssey). The Wachowski brothers seem alternately like geniuses and madmen - at times it almost appears like they are trying to pad out their film with endless scenes only vaguely connected with the main plot (such as the one involving Monica Belluci as Persephore) or with completely unnecessary rave scenes that, much like the intermediate sections of Pod People, just never end (to quote Crow T. Robot: `We paid for the song, so we're going to use all of it!'). Agent Smith apparently doesn't serve any real purpose, except to show up at inconvenient times and be beaten up by Neo. Then again, perhaps we will later learn how he is connected with the two manipulative main forces pulling the strings in the Matrix, which I shall not give away here (the revelation of one came as a considerable shock to me). On the other hand, there are isolated scenes of pure brilliance (such as the final piece of plot exposition) in this plucky piece that are worthy of Clark and Heinlein. The action scenes border between the gratuitous and unconvincing, such as Neo's first encounter with the Smiths (the CGI Neo seen frequently here is uncomfortably reminiscent of Blade II) and the mind-blowing 20+ minute highway chase. Still, the overload of action scenes is somewhat repetitious and made me feel like someone jammed my head into the cushions of a Sharper Image Massage chair and hit the Shiatsu setting.So was I entertained? Yes. Was I bored? Frequently. Was I amazed? Constantly. Did I like the film? I have not the slightest idea. I'll tell you in November.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The fight scenes were boring - it was like they were filling in time to lengthen the movie. Bang, bang, kick, kick. Many of the scenes didn't advance the story at all.The action with the car chases was brilliant and probably the best part of the film. But the worst part was the ending - there was none.

Had this film been the first Matrix - there would not have been a second.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Much like most other action moves that come out today. Now don't get me wrong the action sequences were some of the best I have seen, however that was all there really was.The movie basically said the same thing over and over again. There is no such thing as choice. We are all driven by fate. Only Neo may or may not have the capability to grow beyond fate and become in control of his own choices.  It seems like a good idea except that they kept telling us this over and over again.The Architect for example basically said nothing we did not already know or could have figured out. He just used a lot of big words so it he would sound intelligent. In fact that's pretty much what everyone else did too. They dragged out two word concepts (no choice) into crappy monologues.I was very disappointed in the plot of this movie. It was very thin and showed little real creativity. Go see this movie. but be warned it might suck.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This truly can be called the intelligent mans action movie because I like to think that I'm at least on the sidewalk Smart Street but I didn't know what the heck was happening during most of this movie. I went to this movie for the story/plot, oh its there but well hidden.  Just a bit.  Really I saw it twice in the theater and rewatched some of the intense conversations over and over again on a possibly ""pirated"" version(need I say anything more incriminating).
It posses the question of wether the damn directors even watched the final cut because there are some major pacing problems.  The beginning dragged. What was with the 20min orgy scene.  I got that they were having sex about 3 seconds in.  And the scenes were a lot of information is presented moves way to fast.  And right after that there is chaos and we have no time to absorb athing we've just heard.  If you used all the big words in this movie while playing Scrabble you be a bloody god.  All in all it was ok.  I want to use my intellect while watching a movie but I don't want to watch it 8 times to understand half of what's going on.If you don't want to hear this then don't read on.  But for those who still might be confused and don't have the bank account to keep going back to the theater I'll give you the gist.  My associate and I have come up with a basic theory.  Mined you this is just a theory because this is the kind of movie where they want you to think one thing and then screw you up the ol' corn shoot a half second later.Now the ""architect"" figure speaks about the systemic anomaly.  Meaning that the Matrix is a harmony of mathematical precision but humans cant be rounded off as such.  The ""oricale"" was created to understand why humans kept rejecting the Matrix.  She discovered that if you gave humans a choice to accept the Matrix or not, even if it was subconscious that 99% would accept it.  Our theory is that the  1% that rejects it must be dealt with or the would pose a threat to the Matrix so the world that Zion lives in is a second layer of the Matrix.  A Matrix within a Matrix.  They think they've escaped but they have not. That is why Neo was able to stop those machines at the end.  They are all still plugged in.  If you listen to Morphius in the first film he tells about how Zion was created.  There was the first who was able to wake up he then woke other up.  He was able to manipulate the world around him, thus creating Zion.  This person was the first `the one' he was able to manipulate the world around him just like Neo. Because they are all still plugged in.So to concluded understand that that is really basic.  Because there are still a lot more question that cant be answered until the next movie.  And I mean a lot, really important ones at that.  Example, if the world that Zion lives in is fake than what is the real, real world look like?  Is this whole robot taken over Earth ture or is this all a sick experiment of some kind. I'm telling you folks this is gonna be one hell of big ending.  We're talking on the level of Planet of the Apes, and I'm not talking about that crappy Tim Burton one.  So good luck my friends don't scratch your heads too hard on this one.  All I can say is that I know why they're releasing the next one so soon after.  It's a 5 hour sequel they cut in half.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I get it this movie didn't come out yesterday but a few years prior you see a movie like Final Fantasy The Spirits Within. The ""CGI"" when Trinity jumps out a window is like early PS2 graphics. I'm supposed to be in awe at how awesome the scene is but today I laugh my head off. They REALLY went nuts with this sci-fi space ship and other star wars / star trek type garbage. The cities are so forgetful looking. Lawrence Fishburn is quite possibly the dullest actor in this. He has no emotion. I'm surprised Harry Lennix was in this. He's more famous for The Blacklist.Trinity's actress is uglier than ever. Did the makeup department hate her? Did they do an amazing job and she's worst in real life? I don't know .. but what I do get is that she can fight, she has chemistry with Keanu but is she ever ugly! Sorry to all the computer nerds who read 20+ year old movie reviews that have destroyed countless socks to her like the amount of guys in the sunglasses and suits in this. That ""love"" scene was unnecessary other than to get this past a PG-13.Within 20-30 minutes there was what? One fight. One half baked shooting scene with the bad CGI. Yes they have to fluff this up to get it to that 2 hour mark but I was legitimately bored to tears. I enjoyed a movie I saw with Harry Lennix in it the other day with Arnold Schwarzenegger by some coincidence. The costumes are just as silly as ever. The whole sunglasses at night or in dark areas made me giggle a little.I feel there would have been 50 other ways to approach a sequel without trying to be another star wars or other nonsense space ship sci-fi movie. If I wanted space ships and other stuff virgin slayers watch I'd have watched something else. I'd seriously rather watch a garbage super hero fad movie. I've enjoyed fat Steven Seagal movies more than this piece of garbage. I'd rather watch some obscure anime that even most anime master weeboos haven't heard of and having no subtitles! I'd get more mental stimulation trying to figure out what they're saying than this awful movie. Maybe the colors would stimulate me more than the talktrix regurgitated did.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

Matrix Reloaded suffered from the same stupidity that the latest Star Wars movies did: all special effects, no intelligent story, and acting to laugh at. Yes, the effects were exciting (better than Star Wars). But the Wachowskis seem to have fallen for the trap so many action film makers do: if you have a great 5 minute fight scene, making it 10 minutes long doesn't make it better, just longer. If you have 5 Agent Smiths, why not 500? More is not necessarily better. And the plot? The philosophy sounded like something a good SNL writer would have great fun with. ""We must believe, or else we will not believe. The frammistat of life has many mysteries, but none as mysterious as life itself."" (OK, I made these up, but the actual dialog is just as silly.) Disappointing, since the setup in the first film had many possibilities.

And they know how to blur the line between video game and movie with extreme craft.That being said, I just sat through a very long two-plus hours of alleged razzle dazzle that mostly just sat there like my Uncle Stanley. I know this is half a movie, but all the payoff in the world can not make up for the dead space, monotonous stunts, logic loopholes, wooden performances, subpar effects (yes, some of them just look chintzy), and schmorgasbord approach to plot and character that is the Matrix Reloaded.X-Men 2 had several action sequences that were exciting, character driven, and fresh.  In Matrix 2, the action is so over the top to remove any sense of danger, and thus little sense of excitement.  There is not one second in Matrix 2 that came close to the sheer thrill and ingenuity of Magento's escape from X-Men.And the muddled plot?  I'm sorry, but build up for the next sequel is NOT AN EXCUSE.   The Keymaster?  The Architect?  The GHOST NELSONS? The RIDICULOUS FRENCHMAN?   This could be a 100 hour miniseries, and it still wouldn't matter.  There's nothing interesting or intelligent about any of these new additions, many of which feel like they were straight out of the Mystery Men.On the positive - the car chase has a few remarkable minutes, as does the fight with the 100 Agent Smiths.  But in both cases, the sheer magnitude begins to wear the scenes down.And yet, critics are taking to this humdrum mess.  I don't get it.  You might have like it too.

The whole first hour of the movie is nothing but repetitive doomsaying and characters trading off the ""be careful...don't go..."" speech. But hang on, it only gets worse after that.  The ""state of the art"" camera techniques and digital effects that were interesting in the first movie are now overrated, tired, and overdone. But for some reason, they do it even more in The Matrix Reloaded. The great digital effects are so great that in the scene in which Neo is fighting scores of Agent Smiths, Neo looks like a video game graphic. Terrible. Then as I was staring at the ceiling praying for the movie to end, it did what I didn't think was possible. It got dumber. I can't imagine ""spoiling"" The Matrix Reloaded any more than the writers did, but for the dumbest parts, you'll have to see it for yourself.

The entire script end-to-end consists of cliches that range from banal to laughably pompous.  It's the kind of stuff that seems deep after your first freshman Philosophy course especially if you neglected to actually read any of the assigned material.There was unintentional humor the best of which were the Neo the Flying Jesuit scenes.  All I could think of was the 1960's TV sit-com ""The Flying Nun"".  Some of the FX have very visible seams especially the rear projection parts of the car chase event.A logical flaw is at the center of the premise though maybe that's supposed to impart some deep meaning to the story.  When a character is plugged into the Matrix and is killed in it's virtual reality world why does their body die in the ""real"" world?Save your money on this one and read any book by Philip K.

The first matrix depended on mystery of a developing plot (which was quite interesting)and sweet as hell action. The matrix: reloaded attempts to bring more to the way the films story works, but it fails. Dialouge is drawn out and cheesy. There aisscene after scenes of completely random and useless dialouge and visuals (not good ones mind you, lame ones which take up way too much screen time) which ruin the pacing of the movie. The way they work with effects and the camera is amazing though, and when some plot does unravel it is quite interesting.Much of the ultra-violence from the first matrix is cut out (i know what your thinking, there was lots in the matrix: reloaded, but harldy any of it was near the level of the shootout scene in the first matrix) which can be good for some, but if you expect bullets flying and bodies piling up, you can scratch out that. Although i understand that there was really no need for that in this movie, and i do think the really hot martial arts scenes make up for it, for some it may be a bit dissapointing. There are also plenty of one liners and humor thrown in to give the audience a chuckle. well thats jolly good and all, but it doesnt really fit well with the serious dialouge the characters hold throughout the entire rest of the movie. Overall, much of this movie could have been edited out and made for a better film, while some parts are genius. Worth a watch to form your own opinion since no matter what is said here, you know your gunna go see it anyways. I expect this matrix will pan out better when the third is released.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Most disappointing sequel to a classic since Godfather III","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704539/?ref_=tt_urv","colemric","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2213259/?ref_=tt_urv","26 May 2003","First things first, The Matrix (1999) was a true classic and all concerned should be proud of it. Joel Silver backed a hunch, gave the (largely untried) Wachowskis a huge amount of faith (and a fair amount of money) and they delivered breathtaking originality.However, for anyone who'd ever read any decent science fiction (or even watched more than half a dozen episodes of Star Trek), the originality of The Matrix was never EVER the story line (despite the ""hidden depths"" that Matrix geeks are endlessly determined to point out). No, the originality was almost entirely visual, and how wonderful it was! The plot, characterisation (etc) were all necessary hooks to hang the visuals on but they had little merit of their own. Most importantly, they were kept out of the way of the action. Simple plot + breathtaking visuals = great film.Matrix Reloaded (as everybody who has seen it will know) is FULL of attempts at plot and characterisation. Usually this would be a good thing, but not here. What we have is lots of screen time taken up with plot and ""meaningful relationship dialogue"" which is in practice banal in the extreme. I would say that Reloaded has significantly LESS character or plot interest than Matrix I, despite wasting seemingly endless minutes of screen time, actors, sets and money on an ultimately futile attempt to demonstrate ""depth"".I have no doubt that many people will spend much time (indeed they already have) in ascribing all sorts of hidden meaning and deep significance to all sorts of aspects of Reloaded (and yes, I do realise that ""Neo"" is an anagram of ""One"" . . . ). Many will profess that they feel deeply sorry for my apparent inability to luxuriate in the subcontext. Well, sorry guys, but I fear that all you're trying to do is to describe to me in great detail what the Emperor's New Clothes look like. Believe me, I'm perfectly willing to see them, but I'm pretty sure they ain't there . . .If you've read this far you will probably guess that my greatest anticipation in advance of this film was not in what it would say about the ""world of the Matrix"" but in just how darned cool it would look up there on the screen. However, as has been commented by many before me, the incremental visual effects of Reloaded (relative to what we've seen before) are at most vaguely impressive; they simply fail to have the impact of those seen in Matrix I. This is of course a reverse compliment about Matrix I, which set an impossibly high standard of originality to beat, but it is still disappointing (especially after all the hype) that Reloaded does not contain anything resembling a quantum leap.Moral of this story: the brothers appear to have been given far too much money, far too much time, and nowhere near enough proper ""production control"" in making this film. Shock horror, they may even have started to believe all the Hollywood hype that's been written about them over the last four years. It's a bit like Michael Cimino after Deerhunter (with two differences - Heaven's Gate was actually a good film, and Warner Brothers will still make a ton of money rather than going bust like UA).Maybe I should have expected it? You're probably right, but (just like Morpheus) I like to cling on to my hopes . . . I will go to see Revolutions, and maybe I'll be positively surprised; for sure I'll go in with lower expectations than I did for Reloaded, and I guess that must help . ..","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Not the same as the first one","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0703101/?ref_=tt_urv","blitzfire","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1695151/?ref_=tt_urv","15 May 2003","The one-line summary of mine pretty much sums up my opinion of the movie. As much as I hate to say it, the special effects were a bit overdone. The fight sequences were WAY too long, and I really fear for what Revolutions has in store for me.With that said, I'll get to the technicalities of Reloaded.  First, there's the editing.  This movie was entirely too long, and I don't mean the talking.  The writing was very witty, albeit a little grating on the nerves at times (the French guy comes to mind).  But there were many scenes which could have been cut out altogether and not have lost any of the intended feel the Wachowski's wanted.Second, the fight scenes were not nearly as involving as the first movie. I think that the producers felt that there was no way they were going to top the action sequences of the first one, so they instead threw the money into CG car crash scenes and slow-motion special effects.  By the way, I'm sick of seeing the slow-mo thing now.  STOP IT.  It was neat in the first one to get a better understanding of how fast Neo and Morpheus and Trinity fight, but we know that now.  Don't keep doing it.And was Wo-Ping even on the set for the fight choreography?  The hand-to-hand fight scenes were terribly paced.  They would speed up at a nice clip, then it looked like the actors were having trouble remembering what they were supposed to do next, almost to the point of flinching. The fight scene between Neo and the Oracle's bodyguard comes to mind.Lastly, I feel like the producers and directors thought the audience was stupid.  Gratuitous T & A in the party scene was really unnecessary.  We know that Neo is the one.  We know that he and Trinity are lovers.  We know all this.  There is no need to re-hash it, much less in the graphic sense that it was done in.Anyway, I'm sure most of you will undoubtedly skim over my review anyway. I just felt that as a die-hard Matrix fan, I had to let those of you in league with me have a decent heads-up.I'm out.  Later.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Where? Where to begin?The film sucks for the first forty five minutes. Like no tomorrow I guess is the proverbial phrase. They go on and on about how to philosophise when on drugs. There's circumstances that are straight out of B+B. Now riddle me this my furry friends, why is Zion still like the stone age whence they have all this technology around them?Morpheus is a buffoon. He reeks of stupidity. His decisions are false. His mind is rotten. Lawrence Fishburne's worst role since... Well... It's his worst. Morpheus was a god in the first one, but, in this, no. He's a failure. Not because all our ideals about him are murdered, but, rather because his acting sucks in it.The much touted twins are pointlessly pointless. I mean, their existence in the film is so yawn-inducing that you'd think that it's just two guys and a mirror, smiling, waving at each other. Hullo!The many man fight of Neo and Agent Smith... Oh my frickin god what a waste of what talent they had. The effects are so craaap (yes my friends, a triple A crap) that you sit there thinking, well, if I just stayed at home playing my insert appropriate game console then I would have had more fun. Even in the preview for Revolutions where a million Smith's against one Neo looks lame.Some of the fight scenes (yes, I'm talking about the one just before the oracle, the one just before the keymaker, the whole freeway sequence) are just pointless and s***. They look cool, but, they defy the meaning of Neo being The One. Surely if he were to take on an amateur, he wouldn't falter and wouldn't stumble. Surely he would be able to just stand there with one finger and whoop their ass. But no. The guy's a loser. In more cases than one, he can't handle himself. It seems the only supreme thing he can do is fly. Wow. Like we aint seen that shit before.There's some French guy who can't decide whether he's French or English.The humour fails on every possible level. I think I heard a groan.Fortunately, no children bendy spoony's with f***ed up philosophy this time. Let alone any children at all.There's one genius bit where a chick gets off on a slice of cake. Smart.A lot of the characters are pointless. Jada Pinkett Smith gets one interesting move where she kicks a guy in the head... Wow... Aint seen that before... And that's about all the special things she can handle.Some of the graphics is top notch. Some is just el lamo.As for revolutionising car chases... The French Connection/Ronin/Bullitt can rest assured that they aint gonna be knocked from the top of the list for this. It's nice. That's it. The motorbike bit is wicked. Apart from that, I've done better in my street.The sex... Ha. It's so close and in there that you're kinda sitting there going, well, I don't wanna intrude... It's close, and way tooooo close. Although, it'd have been nice to see a little more of Carrie-Ann...There's a long long long pointless monologue which arrives near the end of the film which you sorta feel as if you wanna jump into the screen and shout.. This should have been The Empire Strikes Back or The Two Towers or BTTF2 or T2 of The Matrix Series. Instead, it ends up being The Mummy Returns or The Phantom Menace and to a lesser extent Attack Of The Clones (even though I rate it as a ***** film).The first film is a legacy. This one just throws that legacy out of the window and says, well, I liked Homer's Odyssey and some of those computer games, oh, and some of those Hong-Kong action movies, we'll just put it in a blender and call it Reloaded...Puhlease.**/*****For your info, I gave the first one ****1/2.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'd heard Reloaded was stepped down a rung or two from the first movie, but I wasn't expecting a movie this poorly contrived.  By trying to stretch a good movie into a series of epic proportions (a la the ever increasingly inadequately named Star Wars trilogy, or the Fellowship of the Ring series), the creators of Reloaded introduced too much repetition, too much melodrama, and way too much reliance on special effects and the action scenes.  Add in a groaner of an ending, and Reloaded becomes one of the most disappointing sequels I've seen in a while.There's nothing unique about Reloaded whatsoever.  It's Star Wars meets Superman meets The Chinese Connection meets Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon meets The Ten Commandments, with bits of pieces of the original Matrix concept thrown in for good measure.  I guess the downside of trying to appeal to everyone is the tendency to lean toward what worked before.  Hey, this is a sequel, right?  But the reliance on concepts from far too many other films warps the feel of the series.  In the first thirty minutes of the movie, it seemed like I'd been watching more scenes from a Star Wars sequel than from a Matrix sequel.There's enough melodrama in this movie to float a soap opera for an entire season.  What's with all the personal tension?  What's with all the kissing, or the dance-orgy in Zion?  What's with the Merovirigian's wife?  Melodrama and hypersexualization wasn't the material that made the first Matrix such a good film.  The relationships between characters like Morpheus and the Commander, or Link and his lover, just seem inappropriate for a Matrix film. It was the concept of the story and the uniqueness of the action scenes that made The Matrix what it is.And there's plenty of action in Reloaded, no doubt.  The action scenes are by far the strong suit of the movie, with a dizzying array of special effects.  The fight scenes play off the unique style of the original Matrix. Reloaded relies so heavily on these scenes, however, that they lose their effectiveness quickly.  The fight scene at the playground between Neo and the Smiths wouldn't have been such a yawner if it ended much sooner.  The thirteen-minute kung-fu samurai car chase was a little out of its league, too.  The repetition of many of the same fighting effects in Reloaded had me checking my watch during a few of the action scenes.  When the ending finally did roll around... well, I'll be honest.  It was a total cop-out.  If you want to find out what happens to everyone, you'll have to see Revolutions.  Most of the viewing public already knew that would be the case, but Reloaded is almost shameless in how it cuts to an ending when it does.In the end, I am glad I saw Reloaded in the theater.  I wouldn't have known what I was missing if I hadn't.  Now that I do know what I would have missed, I can be confident in my decision to save Revolutions for when it hits the rental shelves.  The visual effects of Reloaded were nice, but nothing extra special, and nothing that couldn't be appreciated just as much at home.  The emphasis on melodrama was straight up awful, though, and a lack of the unique features that made The Matrix so entertaining keeps Revolutions from getting half as good.  And so, since I gave The Matrix an 8, Reloaded can't get any more than a 4.  If Reloaded was meant to be packed with action and melodrama to the point of being corny, the movie may have been a bit more tolerable.  But Reloaded takes itself way too seriously to be corny, and thus, it turned into a snoozer instead.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Matrix stands tall, alone, as an interesting film with an odd twist in the middle.

Not much plot, first hour is kinda slow and boring and then you get a lot of action that at times is probably too much action.I figured it would be hard to make another movie as good as the original, but I was at least expecting a really good movie..the sequel is just your average everyday kind of movie.What made the first movie so great was not found in the sequel.

This movie gets a score of 5 out of ten.... the original was a 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The storyline is so thin that people start fighting without any reasons! It's like a bad Hollywood version of a badly done gong fu movie. I see you, you see me, let's fight!The plot made me predict the ending, which I think would be similar to ""Thirteenth Floor"". I hope my prediction is wrong though because it would make ""Matrix Revolutions"" a total crap.Amazingly, ""Matrix Reloaded"" is even worse than ""T3""!

The fight scenes were too long and just rehashes of the first movie, the philosophy was dull and somewhat outdated (and had no place in a movie such as this..sci fi action with metaphysical meandering...what were they thinking??) and to end a movie in such a way that it can't stand on its own is just plain pathetic.

Sadly with this sequel plenty went unanswered and more problems were generated through a ridiculous debate of choice, encoding of action conventions and a pathetic prophecy that demeans the potential of the one.This narrative desperately tries to pick up a healthy real life debate as its predecessor did so easily. The ongoing outdrawn discourse about how choice is created through power and how difficult decisions can hold anyone back. There is simply too much discussion of this concept through the too long film which inevitably leads to the central protagonist having to face this concept. Its as predictable as tomorrow which coming from a massive Sci-Fi fan is one of the biggest disappointments in the genre's history. The weight of this ideology is ruined further by the encoding of the most annoying character in cinematic history the Architect. The man talks in technical waffle, looks like your least favourite uncle and will stare you to death.The ending of the first film showed Neo now believing he is the one so he knows his powers now. This leads you to believe, after his first fight with the agents, that he can do absolutely anything, which takes away the imagination and the fear for his character. He is now an obvious winner which again is sad to see. The prophecy puts an obvious and far fetched spin on the boring narrative in an attempt to redeem the character but fails easily.The first film created the most frightful villains imaginable. Undefeatable objects of our minds known as agents that no one in history had defeated. Now the fear has disappeared with the Agents simply an extra instalment to fit the action purpose.Basically this is a film for the action junkie, using obvious action, technology and used as simple entertainment with no point, and that isn't improved in the final part either.Good effects again, especially a brilliant choice of slow down moments between Neo and Smith's fight, which is also beautifully choreographed. But this was a sad moment for Sci-Fi with sad depressing action, no point and almost ruined the originality and imagination of the first.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I know everyone is raving about the effect, which are ok in the majority of parts, but to me CGI is excellent if you can't tell when it is used, even though you know it has been, such as LOTR, In this film though you van tell when the CGI is used, which at times makes the film laughable.  Also there is no recap, and jumps straight into the film assuming that you must have seen the previous film, which is not always the case especially with a 4 year gap, I just hope that the next film tidies up the loose ends, and also improves on the CGI,  Otherwise it will just proove to me that Hollywood is out to make a profit on a truly classic!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

At all times, you are completely aware that you are in a movie theater with 300 other people, watching the most rapid, dramatic depictions of violence that Hollywood's special effects department can devise at the moment. Lots of hurtling bodies, explosions, and beings with unimaginable powers still popping away with handguns. Hooooooohummmmmm---  You'd get the same experience watching someone else play video games for 160 minutes, or reading a 300-page comic book aimed at violence-obsessed 12-year-olds.This film's claim to social significance will be the fact it is the most racist/sexist movie yet perpetrated by the Hollywood PC propaganda machine. White males make up 100% of the bad guys and 10% of the good guys. The token white male hero is the monotoned robot Keanu Reeves, whose acting makes O.J. Simpson look like Laurence Olivier.Message?

The group I was with all agreed that the movie isn't worth watching again, let alone owning it on DVD.  The plot/script is weak and plods along, Keanu has no emotion and has limited acting range, Fishburne is surprisingly mediocre after being decent in the original.  Carrie-Ann Moss gives the 3rd mediocre performance, absolutely no chemistry with Keanu. The scene where she's supposed to get upset about Keanu locks lips with another woman is totally unconvincing.  The kung-fu action sequences should be boring to anyone over 18 years old.  To anyone younger, they'll get repetitive real quick.  You could feel that they were just an excuse to show off some CGI but the writers/producers dragged the sequences on forever, totally overblown and you know exactly how they're gonna end.As far as the highway scene, I enjoyed the highway scene in Final Destination 2 much more.  This one just dragged.The overall directing was disappointing, it just had a sterile feel.The only thing worth watching was the frenchman and his unique pie concoction. :)The brothers just blew more things up, had more kung-fu action sequences where you know exactly how they're gonna end and used a simplistic plot.The average episode of '24' blows this kung-fu paperthin entry out of the water.  Save your cash and catch the movie 'Spun' when it opens soon. The directing in that blows Matrix Reloaded out of the water.  Mickey Rourke is pretty cool as the drug chemist.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Whereas I thought the original held up quite well, time hasn't been quite as kind to some of the effects in this one and perhaps it has the worst ... ahem ... immoderations of verbosity existing in the discourse are present, ergo it's less gratifying to consume.Six months after the events of the first film, the human resistance have learned that the Machines are digging holes to breach Zion. Recalled to help defend the base, Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) insists on leaving a ship at broadcast range to try and make contact with the Oracle (Gloria Foster), for the prophecy states that war with the machines will end with Neo (Keanu Reeves) inside the Matrix, rather than in the real world. But is the prophecy an illusion, just another level of control within the system, or can Neo make a genuine decision to affect the outcome?I didn't enjoy this particular viewing that much. I've defended ""Reloaded"" in the past, arguing that if you think it's absolutely terrible, just finding it to be average is actually a step up. Here's though, I'm not sure it actually scrapes to average. It is the most... obtuse, that the series gets. There is lots of philosophical debate about free will which is at its most painfully in the scene with the Architect, though he does reveal interesting facts about ""the one"" and what that means. I wonder if that might play a part in the fourth one? The film also takes ages to get going and oft derided scenes, such as the rave, run on for an awfully long time.Some of the action scenes haven't aged well. I still enjoyed the freeway stuff and the film will always be lauded for the undertaking of building that whole stretch of motorway just for this excellent twenty minutes. The burly brawl though hasn't aged that well and it's very obvious when the ""virtual stuntman"" has taken over for Keanu.It's really the first half of a five-hour film, I know that (though apparently everything I remembered about these two films is in this one), but reviewing it as a standalone experience, a few decent scenes aside, it's a bit of a chore to get through.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Hey guys, this movie is called MATRIX Reloaded, so give us what we paid for. I almost fell asleep during the opening half of the movie, and it's by far the most boring ""sci fi/action"" sequence ever recorded on film.Finally we get to the Matrix but the movie goes downhill even further. The action is overlong, boring and cliched, and the dialogue (which was horrid in the opening hour) descends even further in stupidity, and the audience will likely be chuckling at 99% of the lines.If you liked the original Matrix, stay far away from this tripe and maintain the good vibes of the original flick.

The original Matrix merely hinted at the underlying metaphysical questions posed by its premise. In doing so it invited the comic book literate but you also suspect girlfriendless fan base to posit questions about the film's existential ideas. However this bloated and overwritten middle instalment attempts to shade in these areas with disastrous effect. Like Yoda on speed, the characters in this film spout third rate philosophy like there entire conception of English had been based on the Empire Strikes Back and those little bits of paper you get in fortune cookies. Where the original film kept it tight and merely alluded to the back-story, the back-story we discover in Reloaded (much like the Star Wars prequel trilogy) is a lot more interesting in our imagination than it is when its all explained. It would help if any of it made much sense but most of the dialogue is seemingly written with a view to inviting dense speculation and analysis from the internet community and thus imbuing the material with a depth it doesn't possess. This is a film that requires an editor. Its much too long, with some scenes dragging on while you check your watch. With pretencions of profundity the characters speculate about Neo's origins, the nature of existence, their function in the universe and so on. However, the Warchowski's aren't Nietzsche or Kant and frankly, should leave this kind of crap to genuine thinkers. People are going to this movie to see action and martial arts and thats what they should have concentrated on. Reloaded delivers here of course, but although its all more elaborate than before, its also less impressive simply because most of it seems dropped into the narrative for no reason. New characters are introduced but have little to do except turn up and do the obligatory fighting. This is a disappointing sequel, too long to be satisfying, not self-contained enough to stand on its own without Revolutions and too concerned with adding layers of shallow intellectualism to its status as pop-cultural myth to be engaging to its audience. As with Star Wars, its far more fun when the audience fill in the details- when the filmmakers do it they lose the simplicity that made the original enjoyable in the first place. For these reasons alone the Matrix Reloaded is like waking in the real world having experienced the joy of a computer generated illusion. You'll want to take a pill, forget about all this and return to the original as soon as possible.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Fight sequences are too long, too monotonous and too artificial. Acting is almost non-existent, with the exception of Laurence Fishburne (""Morpheus"") and a couple of minor characters, even Hugo Weaving (""Agent Smith"") is not as amusing as before. Mass shots of discoteque in Zion look almost identical to same in ""XXX"", superimposition of Neo's love scene seems overextended and barely necessary altogether. Certain scenes look like they were done for director's amusement, but, unfortunately, fail to do so for the audience. Regardless of how many times a cause-affect relationship is mentioned during the film tracing such through the story itself might cause a hemorrhage, better just relax and accept things as they are.Overall, the movie was somewhat entertaining, special effects, a few minor surprises, some nice visuals and other eye-candy stuff. Having paid US$5.75 for the privilege I figured I overpaid only about US$1.75, which is not too bad. I do not regret having seen it, but for 4 bucks this movie would be right on the money.On the light side: Matrix is apparently running on a UNIX-based system with network connectivity secured by SSH. Make your bets whether we'll see Solaris, HP-UX or Linux logo in the next sequel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The unique themes and perspectives were quite impressive. It had action, fantastic effects, and even some great things to think about.Well...!! What Happened ???It appears that Hollywood success got the best of everyone involved in this film. Some great sequences and still some good ideas but... Noisier, flashier, longer, is not necessarily better. The film is too long, and the drawn out action sequences get to the point of tedium. Those drawn out sequences only take away from the ideas and philosophies that many found rather unique and involving. There really is nothing that allows you to become involved, other than, when's the next shootout, and how will they get away this time. The love  scene was one of the least erotic scenes I've ever seen in an R-Rated film and the Quasi Rave, Disco celebration(?) in Zion, after Morpheus' unity speech was ridiculous. (I had to stop from laughing out loud).  Don't use logic or reason to the, why(?), of the over long fighting sequences because that won't stand up to analysis, they only deaden some of the first films ideas.I know this film will make tons of money. But now,  it's all juvenile shoot-em' ups, and overly long drawn out  fights. (Why did these fights go on forever, when they knew the agents & Smiths couldn't be killedI guess it was for the non-thinkers and pubescent boys that really love that stuff)
So much for some of the first films thought provoking ideas.  This one really left me cold.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Mr. Hollywood Studio is looking to ride the gravy train and make some money on the reputation of the original Matrix film - and after all, the thing everyone loved about the original was the special effects and action scenes, right? Who needs 'plot', 'character' or 'logic' when you've got fancy graphics and violence - such was the thought process used in the making of this atrocity.The work of art that was the Matrix is duly dumbed and watered down for mass consumption, striving desperately to be moving and appeal to everyone but in the process being stripped of all that made the original great and becoming one long, painful cliché - oh the irony, given the innovations of the original. Characters we don't give a toss about are forced down our throats, special effects scenes become the crutch upon which the whole film leans, dialogue can be predicted a full 5 conversation exchanges before being said, and fight scenes become the focal point of the entire exercise - the film tries so desperately to maximise its appeal and move as much of the audience as possible that in actuality much of its impact is lost, the film falling flat on its face in even its central aim, like the pathetic abomination it is.So cheesy was the ending of this that it literally had me in tears of laughter, but I shall not disclose it, that pleasure is yours to be savoured, this film is worth seeing if only for the humorous effect of its intrinsic awfulness. The definitive Hollywood cash-in. A long, painful, unintentionally hilarious piece of crap.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There is no plot and don't expect to see something thats going to change your life the way the first movie did.  About 10-20 minutes into the movie you get to see Zion and shortly after seeing it everyone breaks out into dance for about what seems to be 20 more minutes with some horrible techno tribal music playing and then it's back to slow motion again.  This movie is garbage. I can only hope and pray that the next one will be good.  The ending of this movie sets up the next one to possibly be good, it will at least make it easier to make a good sequel considering the last movie really didn't set itself up for a sequel very well at all.

Some of the effects were jaw-dropping. The most impressive was probably when the multiple agent Smiths were fighting Neo. They were simply amazing and ground breaking visual effects.The script however was very weak and the acting sub-standard. Morpheus is annoying and speaks in such an annoying ambiguity. They way he walks with his arms folded behind his back is equally annoying.Can someone please explain why the characters constantly have to wear sunglasses,even in the most dark areas? Is it really just so they can ""look cool"" around each other? How retarded. Also, why is it the Neo can get hit in the face 47 million times, and his glasses don't get a single crack?Some of the fighting is obviously choreographed, and just not that interesting to watch. There was a period in the film, about 20 minutes in, which lasted about 25 minutes, which was utterly boring, and very out of place.The sad thing about the Matrix Reloaded is that there really aren't any memorable lines. You just have Morpheus blabbing on and on, and Keanu acting like Ted from ""Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure"" - his only realistic performance to date.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I wish I could say it was good. Really. The first Matrix had a good premise and was brilliant on the follow-through. Reloaded give the impression that they spent four years working on the special effects and four minutes throwing together a screenplay to fit them. Once again, the premise had a great deal of potential, but they never bothered to delvelop it. In the end, the plot was thin and the dialog was pathetic. The sad part is, the effects weren't even very good! In the fight scene between Neo and the Smiths, it was obvious when they switched from live action to CGI. The shots of the ships looked completely animated. Zion is a giant rave full of sexed up, fashion victim hard bodies. For some strange reason, while the crew of the Nebachanezer wears rags and eats flavorless slop, the people of Zion wear the finest fabrics and eat a variety of tasty dishes. What's with that? The whole Zion sequence was an overblown music video and less than steamy sex scene. It did have an element of Star Wars envy, with flight controllers remincent of those of Hoth in Empire Strikes Back, and men wearing jedi-like robes and shirts.For the most part, the fight scenes were good and the car chase was exciting, but all in all I'd rather have spent my movie dollar elsewhere.The clifhanger ending leaves one with some hope that Revolutions (opening in the fall) may kick the quality back up to the level of the first film.

Done in 2003 the Wachowski brothers focused more on the graphics than the cast. Also the story just brought more questions than answers, making sure that at the end you will either want to see what is remaining of this series or you will not.The Matrix Reloaded is not so story oriented like the first, what drew many to the cinema to watch this movie (especially me) was the ""Burly Brawl"" where Neo had to fight like 100 Agent Smiths. This brawl featured high tech visual effects, higher than the one used in the previous film. The ""Bullet Time"" technology was set aside and virtual cameras were used to capture some of the effects and complex fight moves that we saw displayed in the ""Burly Brawl"".Now, these exceptionally high visual effects is what makes this movie standout from the rest and the complexity of the action scenes makes every action sequence and fight sequence worth seeing.The other part of the movie which included the story writing was a low from my view; the character development that we saw in the first is set aside here to focus more on the action scenes and the visual effects.The movie plot continues from where the first Matrix stopped, now that Neo (Keanu Reeves) realizes that he is ""The One"" he has many things that he once knew and believed has changed, also changing was the believe of the people in Zion about him, many that doubted saw the things he can do and they too became believers of the prophesy.But many still doubted, now the machines are closing in on Zion and in The Matrix the source is losing control as the program Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) that Neo killed in the first film, has returned this time as a virus infecting other programs and taking over the matrix.Now Neo is faced with the sole fact, he must seek out the source and see if he can bring this war to an end and he must stop Agent Smith.The box office performance of this movie is higher than what the first movie in the franchise brought in. This movie also cost like 2 times more than the first and took home almost two times as much as the first movie did.As I said the story here is not the main drive for me when it comes to this movie, but the effect is exceptional, one that I'm sure you will not mind seeing, so after you have digested The Matrix (1999), you will not mind seeing this one The Matrix Reloaded.Fun fact from Wikipedia says: ""Around 97% of the materials from the sets of the film were recycled after production was completed; for example, tons of wood were sent to Mexico to build low-income housing."" www.lagsreviews.com","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

But even that didn't help. There were some many times I wanted to just laugh at this movie.  Especially when Morpheus addressed the people of Zion. And that sex scene that followed! Completely pointless and not tasteful at all.  As for the action, I believe the producers spent so much time on their ""money shots"" that they forgot about everything else.  I had a I hard time with the terrible CGI that took place in the Mr. Smiths fight scene (it made the CGI in Harry Potter look good).  As for the acting, well obviously thats not what they cared about.  Neo and Trinity's relationship felt cold (if I even felt anything from them) and Keanu's acting hasn't changed since Bill and Teds.  That one line when Mr. Smith said something like ""you use all your muscles but the one that matters the most"" almost made me falling out of my chair laughing from the irony.Over all, the action scenes couldn't cover up everything.  No matter what you wipe your butt with, its still sh*t.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Oh yah, I'm going to hear, you didn't understand it, you just didn't get the sublime thoughts and on and on.  Well it was not only one of the most boring movies of all time, but the most expensive boring movie that I have ever seen.  It's an insult to the fan's intelligence and to say anything more complimentary is only fooling yourself more than what the Hollywood moguls have already done by convincing us to buy tickets to the movie. I really felt cheated, even violated by a dumb story line, limited dialogue, excessive and  redundant    action scenes all which contributed  to a movie which surely put me and not a few others to sleep.  After an hour, I was ready to walk out, and other less timid souls actually did.

Reloaded tries to run with the 1984 meets the Bible and drops it at some point in favor of beating us over the head with the same philosophical debates over and over, and with special effects that a room full of monkeys could recreate with an Apple Powerbook and a trial release of Maya 4.5. Yes, six months after the events of the Matrix Neo (Keanu Reeves), Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), and Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) return to the big screen to stop an invasion of a quarter of a million evil robots from saving their bastion of free humanity, Zion. During the agonizing and yet at other times exciting trip to the inevitable cliffhanger Neo runs again into Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) and the accented Lambert Wilson playing Merovingian a rogue computer program who reinforces several major American stereotypes about the French (i.e. that they are evil, greedy, and randy). There is very little interesting characterization in this film; picture a Cartesian plane and that's about as round as the characters get. This is no surprise with our pool of actors, who have long histories of being able to play characters with emotional ranges of Chia Pets. I am however disappointed with Cowboy Curtis, I expect more from such a beloved childhood friend, his grand oration is a huge let down as his voice though smoky and seductive up close and personal drops off to a bit of a whisper when it gets louder. The story-line is simple: fight, exposition, fight, redundant banter, fight, redundant banter, fight, redundant banter, fight, redundant banter, fight, cliffhanger seen from a mile away on a foggy night. The basic philosophy of the film, which delves more into the nature of choice than the nature of reality, is easy to understand but is presented in such a way as to make it a great tool to teach two-year-old children about how their lives are already planned right down to the Dilbert comic that they're going to place on their own patch of felt. There are a few plot twists, but they aren't really great leaps, the Wachowski brothers' idea of foreshadowing seems to have been borrowed from mob bosses' secret hideouts in Chuck Jones cartoons. Now for my incredible plot twist, I'm going to talk about some things that I like about the Matrix: Reloaded. First, lots of action. Where the golden age of the Studios had dancing with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, the modern era has martial arts films with Jet Li and a bunch of wires. Reloaded is doused with action in everywhere from basketball courts to the L.A. freeway. The action sequences are cathartic (in a way that prevents you from hunting down Keanu Reeves and throwing a pie at him) and really pick up the pace of a movie that otherwise acts like a dog chasing its tail. I know that I lampooned the special effects earlier, but even after appearing in every movie for the past four years, if you've ever attempted 3D computer based animation you know that it can be a life draining experience. Reloaded fails to innovate but it does orchestrate some beautiful explosions and fight scenes. It seems that if we were to judge Reloaded solely by the pop-film formula of `the sheer awesomeness of an action film is equal to the body count, times the size of the explosions, to the power of the number of fight scenes' then reloaded ranks up right behind the perennial favorite XXX. As for set design and costuming; I feel that the art direction staff and Kym Barrett need a round of applause. While it is the cliché dystopian world, similar to ours yet dirtier, it just works so well with its grand office buildings, stark white halls and slimy alleys. The symbolism of the great white room of Zion's control tower (religious imagery), and of the light pouring through the gate at the end of the long tunnel (religious imagery) cannot be denied. The costuming, from Neo's cassock (which is reminiscent of the garb of an Eastern Orthodox priest), to the latex which always seems to cling in an ever so flattering way to Miss Moss's body, to the nifty sunglasses that everyone is always wearing, you just sit and say `I wish that I had tight latex pants like that', or possibly `how does Cowboy Curtis keep those frames on his face when they don't have arms?' Overall Reloaded clocks in at a tiring 2 hours and 18 minutes. It tries to reach to the lofty philosophical heights of the first film and then decides that sex and chatter are decent substitutes. Still if the Matrix was a story of birth, then Reloaded was a story of life and sexuality (a bit). If you have a free afternoon in the coming weeks and are looking for something with a bit of action and not so much thinking then Reloaded is for you, otherwise you might want to wait until this one hits network TV in 13 months.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Is there another reality? in mind or in our perception of our world? what's reality?

Loads of ponderous star-trekkie pronouncements.Loads of bromides that sound philosophically profound if you're, well, loaded.And if a movie about a mathematical genius has to have a car chase (the inexcusably ignorant ""A Beautiful Mind""), it makes perfect sense that a movie that mostly takes place in the binary world of 1s and 0s, where cars do not exist, would feature The Most Expensive Car Chase Ever.So George Lucas swallowed the silly fan faction that he was some sort of mind-bending genius.

For everyone who liked the first film for it's briliant blend of story and action will walk away from Part 2 I'm afraid with their heads down and stratching it while yawning wondering ""what the heck happened""The film is simply flat. This review will contain no SPOILERS!!!! and this means this review will be a little flat. The film picks up shortly after the events of part 1, and the film never gets going. We simply follow our cast around Zion listening in on conversations etc.... I will tell you that some of the images of Zion were very well done but nothing we haven't seen in Star Wars, Star Trek etc....Just when you think the movie might take off after a big over the top speech by Morpheus the film drags on for another 10 minutes with a un-expected sexual montage.The acting in part 2 in my opinion is not on par with the first film. It seems that the cast sat around the set too long while making this movie and just delivered their lines. The dialogue varies from simplisitc to very long winded speeches.The Muscial score is probably the worst aspect of Matrix Reloaded. It's simply non-existent. No dramatic themes or exciting adernaline rushing music at all. The action scenes suffered from this the most.
The Special effects is nothing ground breaking unless you consider it really exciting to sit through a long drawn out street fight between Neo and 100 Agent Smiths??? You find yourself wondering is this fight going to end. There are really no epic shots in this film. I can think of maybe 3. By the end of the film your saying ""been there done that"" because frankly how much more interesting can the fights get when everyone is flipping around in slow motion or fighting 100 agent Smiths all day?Some of the good things I liked in the film which are not many at all is once again the editing during the fight scenes is awesome. No shaking cameras or extreme close ups which I find annoying. They are well balanced but the fights are too long and over the top. The scene involving Neo and the Oracle is the highlight of the film in my opinion. It's clever and we learn a lot in that scene. The ending I wouldn't even classify as a cliffhanger rather it just leaves you hanging and saying ""To be concluded""
In conclusion the film falls well short of the first film in more ways than one. From the acting to the story it all takes a leap backwards rather than forwards. You do learn more about what the Matrix is and what makes it tick and who is in control but the story overall is very weak along with many other mis en scene in the film. I give it a 4 out of 10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

No doubt it is bigger, faster and more stylish - 'faster' is to say, the story is anxiously pirouetting along and the main characters make iconic dress-puppets. All actors have earned a Sports Oscar for their performance. Yet in comparison it pales to the classic ""The Matrix"" deservedly has become. It's a Down-to-Earth for all who have wondered how such geniuses as the Wachowskis could have emerged overnight - I suspect both Matrix sequels were really faked by the matrix, or hastily scribbled by two guys completely thrown by their success. The story would maybe work if they had either decided to make 8 sequels or stick to the red string - Neo - and make it really interesting. His love affair with Trinity is very touching, but doesn't make the day. I waited for the story to draw me in like it did in the original, but in vain. The Merowingian is an interesting character, but interchangeable like almost everything else. Neo's encounter with the Architect should be the high point of the film, but stands out as a rather over-sophisticated two minutes in two hours of random Kung fu ballet. Hugo Weaving as Smith is a 'survivor' from the old crew and I always enjoy his great sarcastic performance, but the fact he is built up to be Neo's Nemesis spells out the lack of new ideas. The philosophical side of the film is more satisfying than it first seems, though. I doubt many will appreciate it, it's too overblown and alien in contrast to the action. So while both sequels added up don't come anywhere near ""The Matrix"", the action is fun to watch - the speedway chase is really breathtaking. Looking close at the cast I noticed some entries for ""Thomas Anderson age ..."" - as a Matrix fan I would like to see those deleted scenes. Both Matrix sequels are stumps - so much is left out that it would be interesting to compare the finished product to what the directors originally intended.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But it is a quite good movie, a pleasure to see. Thus, I expected something of the sequel, I thought that, at least, it would be beautifully shot, that the action sequences would be as great as in the first one. So I tried to get in three times and the cinema was always full. Of course, this fact increased my expectations and I even hoped to see a really good movie. At last, I managed to see it yesterday night, and when the lights were on again, I was furious. What is wrong with you people? How can you like this million dollars trash? First, the choreographies are really not very special and the way they are shot is worse than lousy. It is always the same thing, a kick, or a long jump, the camera freezes for two or three seconds, turns 30 degrees and the action continues. This scheme is repeated every time. Besides the special effects use too much the computer and the characters are often replaced by computer images lacking of realism where men look more like Play station figures than to real flesh and blood human beings. In an other side, the film lacks completely of rhythm, it is boring, the action sequences are too long and there is never a climax of the plot, you never fell the great moment of the picture, maybe because there is no end. As the first one, The Matrix Reloaded has dialogues really, but I mean, really ridiculous, false, cheaply melodramatic but without poetry, big sentences trying to sound philosophical without even being  intelligent, sometimes even without meaning anything. And this great pieces of intelligence come in completely unjustified moments. If Morpheus could be more stupid, we would not be able to speak. They try to make feel that this movie has a philosophic content with a debate between Sartre's determinism and free will, a debate so shallow and stupid that it would be better to erase it. The film, thanks to this story and to these awful dialogues, becomes a sort of parody of the first one. The plot is too complicated and seems to take time from the characters who are not explored, often just presented. With characters, the Matrix Reloaded seems to treat them like trilogies, like Star Wars, but the problem is that the first Matrix was not thought as the first chapter, not like this second episode. And could someone explain me what is this thing with the Bible? Why is Neo dressed  like a monk and why does Morpheus preach to Zion (the Bible again) from a mountain, like Moises from the Mount Sinai? This is an analogy typical in epic trilogies, but completely useless and senseless, put there to make us think that this movie is not as shallow as it seems. Is this a profound metaphor, where Neo is Jesus, the Architect is The Father, Trinity Marie Magdalene and Morpheus who knows who? Ridiculous. Even using an allegoric interpretation in this movie, dramatically, there is too many loose ends, and these resemblances with the Bible are as stupid and shallow as the rest of this lousy picture. Don't tell me everything is going to get clear in the third one, because every movie has to have a story and be worthy to see alone, even if it is part of a bigger story. To conclude, let's just say that this is one of the biggest cinema scams ever, an awful picture with lousy (comparing them to the first Matrix, of course) and long action scenes, obvious computer special effects, bad story and dramatic content without even a Hollywood structure, really cheap philosophy, and dialogues overwhelmingly bad, shallow and stupid. I should not be wasting my time writing about this movie but I am going to all the bad publicity I will be able to do, and I will never see the third part.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The special effects significantly enhanced the story.In the sequel, the special effects are all that remains. They are truly spectacular. But they are not enough to sustain interest. The movie stimulates the senses but not the gray matter. There is a huge amount of action on the screen but virtually no motivation. I observed the movie. I was not draw into it. I did not feel involved.The dialogue has degenerated into a series of over-bloated cliches. The story has become muddled, and self-defeating. Neo's love affair is flat, unconvincing, and detracts from his character. Morpheus has become a cardboard cut-out of his former self. Only Agent Smith still retains some shine.By the end of the movie, I no longer care whether Neo is the One or not. I no longer care whether the machines are victorious or not. Having witnessed the Zion ""Rave"", I have come to understand that life inside the Matrix is far far better than life outside it.The entire rebellion against the machines has become a waste of everybody's time, especially mine.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I didn't buy into any of it.Now, let's talk about the sex scene with the hip hop dance sequence.  Did anybody enjoy that?  What did it have to do with anything?The acting was subpar all around.

It's opening should be watched by every film student as to how to hook an audience. The Reloaded version tried to pull out all the stops, f/x and philosophy. As a piece of pure film making it is in a class of its own. As a movie I would watch multiple times it falls short. Why? Well, the story gets bogged down in its own circuitous philosophy. What is real and what is memorex was dealt with nicely by French Philosopher Rene Descartes. I think therefore I am. Also the Socratic dialog wears thin after about thirty seconds. You can't continue dialog when nobody makes a statement. Frankly, the whole movie reminded me of a Salvador Dali painting. Interesting, but you wouldn't want to hang it over your bed. Keeanu Reeves minimalist star turn gets boring, when he isn't beating the snot out of Mr. Smith clones. The freeway sequence makes Steve McQueen's Bullitt look like a game of paddy cake, but there's so much mingling of real and CGI that anybody with a lick of intelligence knows you're looking at an impossible sequence. It all reminds me of the age old show business legend about the actor who believes the stories fed to the papers by his own press agent. As I left the theater, I think my own misgivings were summed up by a woman who asked her partner, ""It was an incredible movie, but what was it about?"" Her partner responded, ""If you have to ask the question then you will never know the answer."" I think they should both chill out on a smoothie and have a good night's sleep. The rating is overblown by the fans. I give it a 6 on a scale of ten. It will make a lot of money, but in the end it was merely sound and fury signifying nothing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I saw The Matrix and was amazed. It was the most spectacular movie ever made. What ever possesed the Wachowski brothers to do this film is beyond me.There is no plot, you can't argue with that. Basically all this film was was a load of talking, and don't get me wrong, I have no problem with talky films, but all the talking in The Matrix Reloaded was a pointless load of drivvle. Then there would be a fight sequence which lasted WAY too long, then more pointless drivvle, then another fight scene that lasts too long and it all builds up to the biggest anti-climax ever. A little bearded bloke talking a load of uncomprehensible bull for 20 minutes.Also, Keanu Reeves gives his worst performance yet. I knew he wasn't a good actor but this was beyond a joke. If you watch his films in the order he was in them it would seem he got gradually worse as they went along. God knows what his performance is like in Something's Gotta Give!

With the exception of the ghostly albinos, every fight scene seemed gratuitous. Pointless. And yes, BORING -- if you've seen a fight scene from the original, you've pretty much seen all the fight scenes here, too. (Especially the one with all the Agent Smiths. Neo should have realized very quickly -- from past experiences with other Agents if nothing else -- that battling the Agents was futile.) The chase seen was at least a little interesting, but it ran too long as well.The effects were disappointing as well, because they weren't better than in Matrix 1. Just more of the same. The fight with the Agent Smiths often looked like a video game. An awesome video game, mind you, but a video game nonetheless.There was enough of a plot, which was good enough, to make a reasonable 100 minute movie. Some of the philosophical stuff should have been cut. (When the Keymaker said he knows some information because he's supposed to know it so he can tell Morpheus and friends, I just rolled my eyes. What a cheap copout.)Had they reined in the fight scenes, I would have left the theater feeling entertained. But they didn't.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But first and foremost it had an intelligent Sci-Fi rendition of the New Testament story complete with all the archetypes: John the Baptist, disciples, Judas, demons and of course the Savior (I will not bore you with the all the fine and not so obvious details that parallel the Biblical account). Just to make it clear: I have it in my DVD collection and consider it a masterpiece.As opposed to that, what does this sequel have to offer? Tones of special effects blown out of every proportion to the point of being distracting (I heard chuckles from the audience during the action scenes). And this is quite deliberate. They have to distract you from the fact that there is no substance to this hodge-podge. There is no story (what story there is, can be told in one sentence), there is no spirit, and there is no mystery aside from what is cleverly ""concealed"" within the title.This distraction is brilliantly executed, no mistake about it, but the fact remains: this is all much ado about nothing. In the first half hour of the movie hardly anything significant happens and there is one excruciatingly long scene that had me thinking ""oh, for crying out loud - get it over width!"" Someone from behind me actually voiced the same opinion.I am stupefied by the fact that the same crew that made such a masterpiece as the first Matrix movie could produce this. My only hope is that they redeem themselves in the next (and hopefully last) sequel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With a little more intelligence in storytelling this state of the art & style movie could have been the younger brother of masterpieces like Blade Runner or Alien. I cared for the characters and I enjoyed all the speed and the eye candy. This first one had a story to tell. 2) Matrix Reloaded still has this stylish green/grey/black look and the more than usual styled costumes. And receive my respect for the highway scenes and the scenes around Miss Bellucci and her guy (these scenes deliver the rare humour and oneliners of the movie). Fine. But to be honest: Did YOU realy care for anyone in this movie? What about those faceless and lost crowd of beauties dancing in the middle of the earth (Zion)? They laid a portion of pathos over it and lost all the impact of the powerful soundtrack in part 1! Why didn't they spent one of those billions for FX just in a clever screenplay? Aren't you seeking for something MORE in a movie - guys, whats wrong with a thrilling story inbetween all those playstation levels they offered to us viewers? Well after all this one is only slightly better than the truely  terrible Star Wars 2 (Hey!  - and I'm still a huge SciFi fan!).  Of course we'll all watch part three - just to know how it ends.

ONE terrible movie isn't enough, it must be diluted to make TWO installments? That's a shame, because it was quite a challenge to do something both appealing and imaginative after the first Matrix, in storyline as well as visuals. Here on the good side, some eye candy (the multiple Mr Smiths, the ""Superman thing"", the highway chase), a few funny moments (the French collector, the background images in the final face-off with the architect), a and some really interesting work on what different computer programs would behave and look like in virtual reality. However, those rare good points are drowned in pseudo-suspense, and are only marginally enjoyable, while dangling plot pieces (the kiss with no consequences of any sort, the seraph who's only good enough for a fight), overpresent and boring fights, and positively revolting elements (the induced orgasm, the party, the utterly ridiculous bullet-removal scene) bring acute embarrassment and displeasure. The ""to be continued"" screen at the end nailed it: that's a serious case of coitus interruptus and throws major disrepute on the film's makers.

I hoped that against cliche it might outdo the original, ala X-Men. This was always going to be tough as unlike X-Men the bar set by 'The Matrix' was so high. But I never expected 'Reloaded' to fall so far short. Somehow, and to my amazement, the Wachowski Brothers, Joel Silver and Warner's have managed to create a film that I found less entertaining than X2.In an attempt to outdo the first film in terms of action and spectacle, the Wachowski Brothers have created a story that collapses under the weight of dull and at times impenetrable dialogue between cliched and seemingly irrelevant characters for which the viewer feels no or little connection. The intimate grandeur and intricate clarity of 'The Matrix' is sorely missing from 'Reloaded'.Part of the problem here is that this is the 'middle' of three movies and they were not planned as one story from the beginning. The second and third exist because of the success of the first, a movie designed for maximum impact and as standalone entertainment. 'Reloaded' and 'Revolutions' are movies driven by the 'franchise factor' rather than by the art of storytelling. The makers have done an analysis of what made the first successful and have tried to integrate as much of these elements as they can to maximise its earning capacity. This has resulted in a mangled story and the debasement of a modern classic.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The fun in the Matrix was in the discovery, your discovery of ""the matrix"", and the storyline discovery of Neo.While not being a English graduate, I have a good grasp of the English language and felt the dialogue was clunky and obtrusive. In the Wachowskis clamour to have grandiose speeches, they forgot to make the point of them clear to the average cinema goer. A lot of people have mentioned they understood the speeches after repeated viewing but I dont think that really cuts the mustard.I almost yawned during the ""Agent Smith Park"" scene because instead of being visually impressive, i found the execution, if not the idea, dull and soul less, alot like most recent blockbusters in the sense that all the purpose of the elaborate set pieces is to visually out do the pack of contemporary action films instead of really having a point or any logic in the scene.I think that was my whole problem with the movie, it seemed an execution in self indulgence from the Wachowskis and lacked the charm and mystery of the first film.

Although I thought the first Matrix was pretty incredible, the original story had many inconsistencies, plot holes, and unanswered questions.  The original was still able to shine because the awesome martial arts and spectacular special effects stole the show.  The sequel does answer some of these questions and fill in some of the holes in the original, but the explanations are so outlandish it is hard to believe it.   I believe the writers have taken their sci-fi license too far in many cases.  The characters babble too much about philosophy and it just causes the story to drag.  The main problem with the sequel is actually the fight sequences, however.  They really haven't done anything new here and I believe the fighting in the original was much better.  I went to this movie to be entertained, and I was expecting better martial arts.  Make sure you are fully caffeinated before sitting down to watch this movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"2","/10","Such a Disappointment","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0703166/?ref_=tt_urv","ChineseBoxer","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0365702/?ref_=tt_urv","16 May 2003","""Granted, you can't give us the same sense of wonder that we had with the first film.""   This is the statement I've heard from many people and, having just watched the movie myself, I agree with this sentiment entirely. The film seems to lack solid direction on many fronts and is not really watchable in of itself, unlike many other trilogy ""middles.""   Whereas the first film had characters that evolved throughout the film, the characters in this film do not. They are given simple fortune cookie dialogue answers which they then go about and repeat to the other characters and so everyone instantly changes. This dialogue, although not as bad as any line in your average Crichton film, is so terse and ultimately useless to the audience as everyone does just repeat what is truly fortune cookie zen blather based on silly events and analogies. What was present just enough to be hip and interesting in The Matrix is now omni-present, filling virtually every line of the movie that is not directly about sex or a threat. This would be forgiveable if it did not so suddenly disrupt the flow of the movie, bringing events to a sudden jarring and unforgivable halt as we watch dialogue of the nature of man's existence provoked by, of course, orgasmic cake. I wish I were making this up, but unfortunately for viewers I am not. In any movie where the audience laughs at the cheesiness of the dialog is in trouble, but after four years of waiting I really expected more from a script.   That brings me to the other chief complaint with this film: it isn't really a film. In other trilogies, there are of course ""hooks"" given in the film which go intentionally unresolved. However, there are issues that do get solved in the movie you watched so that you leave the film feeling that the heroes, although they have work yet to do, have at least accomplished something. With Reloaded, almost nothing is resolved, to the point where you wonder why some things made it into the movie at all. (Example: Link's family problems. We spend too many scenes finding out that his wife doesn't like him with Morpheus, particularly for such a minor character. That's all we find out, not resolution whatsoever to it.) The heroes resolve nothing at the end of the film, which was why two of the three audiences I saw it with booed at the end of the film. The story is wholly incomplete, and ultimately very unsatisfying. I left the theater feeling that, instead of having watched a film, be it part of any trilogy or stand-alone, that I was conned into paying full price for what only amount to an Act Two. In the Act two of a play, nothing is resolved but instead the conflict is better explored and the situation made dire. This is not the usual course for a movie trilogy ""second film,"" which instead has historically (and correctly) been essentially a three act play that fulfilled the larger Act Two role instead of being only that, the setup to a conflict without any resolution, big or small.  If the Wachowski brothers have an artistic vision they feel the need to express in two films beyond The Matrix (which did have its hooks but also stood alone as a real film), that is absolutely fine. However, if they expect me to pay for dissatisfaction, which is what they offer, then that is not fine. I spent four long years waiting for this film, and I couldn't have been more excited. Reloaded has left me fundamentally betrayed and I will be happy never to support the Wachowski Brothers again.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Very good.Reading through all the negative comments, I have to wonder if I saw the same film as the rest of the people around here. Or whether my expectations were too low, or my standards are. Either way, I enjoyed this film way too much to be believed. And I sincerely thought this movie would be an awfully bad one.Comparing the Star Wars films (the new ones) to Matrix is an injustice. George Lucas is too inept and boring to be compared to any filmmaker alive - he's the Ed Wood of our generation. Comparing Matrix to LOTR is an excercise in futility - people who have read the books actually know how the Trilogy will end. Matrix is something... different. It's a lot of special effects, a lot of philosophical talk, and, yep, lots of surprises.I have *actually* talked with my boss for one hour straight about what Matrix: Revolutions will be like, and what, exactly, is the Matrix. And I guess that's what this movie is about - it gives you lots of hints about what the Matrix really is, but never tells you exactly what to expect. Given this approach, it's practically impossible to judge whether this was a good film or not. It absolutely depends on Revolutions and Matrix I to tell it's story - whether it's Neo's past or future, no answers can be found on Reloaded.Given this situation, it's quite difficult to judge this movie as a stand-alone product.But that damn car chase... whoa.ps Am I the only one who is actually expecting to hear Keanu Reeves shout ""Most Excellent, Dude!"" everytime he cocks his head to the side in amazement?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I have decided to update a few reviews that I do not think are good. This is one of those reviews I felt was bad. Matrix Reloaded was the first big disappointment of the year and Revolutions only disappointed more. When The first Matrix came out it was cool. Only hints of that coolness are still in Reloaded. I will admit The Matrix was not 100% original. But The Wachowski's did the best they could and gave us cool and likable characters, a memorable villain, fantastic action and special effects, and to top it off they gave the movie an energy that alot of sci-fi films in the 90s(with the exception of one or two) lacked. When The Matrix debuted in 1999 it was a huge success and became instantly popular. If the film had any pretentions they were kept to a minimum. The same cannot be said about its sequels. The Matrix Reloaded consistently looks good. The Special Effects are great. Reloaded has the atmosphere that the first Matrix had. Although it looks a notch below what the first film looked. It is kind of odd because the first Matrix budget was 63 million and this one's is 127 million. The acting is not as good here. Keanu Reeves really does not appear much in the film. A lot of people would say thats good but you dont identify with him much here. When he occassionally says dialogue, he is very stiff. Laurence Fishburnes character has become boring but its not all his fault. Carrie Anne Moss still has her presence as Trinity. Hugo Weaving is excellent (again) as Agent Smith. There are some new annoying characters, such as the one who plays Link (irritating). The twins seemed like interesting villains but there not in here much. Monica Bellucci is wasted here, there really seems to be no point for her here. Reloaded offers some impressive action sequences. The fight scenes are all good. The fight scene with Neo versus 100 Agent Smith's was outstanding. The car scene that everyone loves is not bad but I found it overlong. If it was cut down a bit, it would have been excellent. Reloaded's main problem is that it is pretentious. The dialogue that is spoken here is pretentious and near the end of the movie it is unbearable. There are also some pointless scenes. The Zion dancing shirt scene was dumb and pointless. The talking was awful as mentioned. Overall, Reloaded does have good points but the bad significantly outweighs them.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

All I had to spend was the $3.00 for parking my car.After what seemed like four hours later, the movie ended and I felt like I'd wasted that $3.00 and a few hours of sleep.I imagine that the Matrix Reloaded will make a ton of money.  It has everything that the junior and senior high school kids love:  Lots of fight scenes, loud techno music (and I use the term loosely), lots of fight scenes, some bare flesh, lots of fight scenes, car chases and crashes, lots of fight scenes and some great special effects.  Oh, and we can't forget all of the fight scenes.  Plus just to try to claim a message for the movie, there was a lot of psychobabble thrown in as an afterthought.It is hard to believe that the same people who made The Matrix, made The Matrix Reloaded.  It reminds me of certain computer products that Symantec bought, lobotomized and then repackaged.Aiming towards the teen target audience, the fight scenes were enhanced and lengthened to perhaps five times as long as they should have been.  It was much like watching a porno... the same action over and over (usually with the same two characters) from different angles.The only redeeming features of this movie were the special effects. Everything else was overdone, drawn out and obvious filler.In a nutshell... Matrix Reloaded could have been cut to 18 minutes and tacked onto the Matrix, or left to start Matrix Revolutions and we wouldn't have missed a thing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving, Jada Pinkett Smith, Gloria Foster, Nona M. Gaye, Monica Belluci. Long-awaited special effects extravaganza sequel to THE MATRIX doesn't live up to its hype. Neo (Reeves) has to stop Zion from being destroyed within 72 hours and save Trinity (Moss) from a grueling demise in his dreams. Fishburne gives a classic example of overacting during his preaching scene in the beginning and Moss looks about 15 years older than the first film, even though this began shooting in 2001. The much-hyped special effects will disappoint some (especially during the car chase when it's obvious that the actors are fighting in front of a bluescreen), the film is virtually incomprehensible if you haven't seen the first film, and it's way too long. NOTE: Aaliyah was supposed to play the character of Zee before she was killed in a plane crash August of 2001. Foster, who plays the Oracle, died in September 2001 after completing a majority of her scenes for this film. However, she did not film any of her scenes for THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS, the concluding chapter in this series coming November 2003. ANOTHER NOTE: I am not a fan of THE MATRIX, so it was hard for me to like this film, but it was still entertaining enough to get a mediocre rating. RATING: 5 out of 10. Rated R for graphic violence, profanity, and sexual situations.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Some have, but most simply turn out to be Hollywood's answer to generating a big pile of money. Matrix Reloaded is no different. I wanted to be surprised and engaged by this film but all it really amounted to was a snazzy action flick (can there be too much action folks?) that attempts to wrap up neatly with a four minute explanation by ""the source"" at the end. A very unengaged plot as far as what one may expect from the stellar script of the original. On it's own it is probably a competent action film, but it simply tries, but cannot reach the complexity and originality of the first. Example: In the original ""Deja-Vu is simply a glitch in the system"" (very cool). Reloaded: ""people's stories of Vampires and Werewolves are computer programs that have gone bad"". Kinda lame. The character development was obviously not as important as the over-the-top freeway scene, and it shows. I thought the Wachowski bros. (sp?) had complete control of this project, but it has all the markings of a film that has been disciplined by greedy producers and studio heads.

I'm sure a lot of money grubbing decision makers had a hand in making this the monstrosity it is.  Don't ya know that when you have a winning formula you stick with it?  You don't take selective ingredients and inflate them to grotesque proportions.  This series is over.  Its very, very sad.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

What I recall is that it was a far better film than this sequel. The Matrix: Reloaded seems to have been pieced together for no other reason than to cash in on the first film and it lost its soul in the process.Many of the elements that made the first film such a delightful treat are missing from this installment. The Matrix: Reloaded loses some of the plausibility of the first film and it seems to have been dumbed down to the point that it loses its edge and becomes a somewhat mediocre action hero flick. Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity take themselves so seriously that they become uninteresting caricatures of themselves. What redeem the film for me are the action sequences. The special effects team continues to blow me away with fight scenes that are amazingly choreographed and brilliantly rendered. The battle between Neo and the Mr. Smiths is incredible, as is the protracted fight/chase scene on the freeway. The Matrix: Reloaded is disappointing in its failure to live up to the reputation of the original.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Having heard some negative comments from people who had already screened The Matrix Reloaded, I suggested we see the X-Men. My teenage son would not listen and we unfortunately bought tickets for the former. I first sensed trouble when I saw only about 50 people in a theater that can accomodate about 500 (this on a weekend afternoon). About half an hour into the movie we both wanted to walk away but chose to remain to see the ""fantastic"" special effects advertised in the promotions. Bad move...it just got worse from what I thought was bad enough. I cannot find any redeeming qualities in this movie except that it cured my constipation. My son, who is a big Matrix fan by the way, was totally disappointed and did not stick around for the preview of Revolutions....in fact almost no one did. This movie is easily one of the worst exploitation flics in recent memory and shame to anyone who was involved in its production and even worse in its promotion.

Certainly the story isn't as strong as the first film, and it isn't as mind-blowing.  But that's not to say it's not strong in it's own right. Of course it's not going to be as ""original"" as the first, considering how groundbreaking the first one was. An action, sci-fi, special effect movie with actual depth drawing on the classics; cinematic, literary, and philosophical? Nearly unheard of previous to that first film.But this film has it's own twists and turns, and if you want to know what's going on you better pay attention.  The special effects were amazing. George Lucas should go to this movie with a stenographer and take some copious notes on how to make CG characters look good.  It's an enhancement for actors George, not a replacement for them.There was some things I noticed that were a slights for me.  I thought the music was pretty subpar, particularily the music during the fight scenes. I would have been happier with them recycling the music from Trinity's first scene in the first Matrix, with her first scene in this movie.  Just seemed a bit off to me, almost dated relative to this film, whereas in the first movie, even though some of the songs weren't new at the time of that movie, the music seemed fresher, more futuristic, more relative. *shrug* Could just be me.The other thing that I noticed was the overall lighting seemed lighter to me also, which I prefered the darker imagery of the first movie.  The matrix in this movie seemed decidedly less seedy in this incarnation.
All and all, very minor negatives to what is overall a suberb movie. Definitely one to see in the theaters.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Released four long years after the original, Reloaded seemed to be some sort of cruel joke played on the public, as if the world that inhabited the creators of an original and exceedingly well crafted Hollywood movie was nothing but a dream. There is very little to like about the second installment of the Matrix franchise, and what merit it does have is buried under layers and layers of garbage.Although the movie was four years after the original, which meant that every action movie had ripped it off and every TV show had spoofed it, it takes place only 6 months later. With only four main characters left surviving from the first movie, we get introduced to a whole knew group of people, namely the inhabitants of Zion, a massive underground city and the last holdout of mankind. Here we are introduced to Niobe, a sassy ship captain and former love of Morpheus; Link, the new guide for the crew when they plug into the Matrix, and other assorted characters. Neo and Trinity are in love, and boy do the Wachowskis get that point across. As if the ten minute sex scene inter spliced with the citizens of Zion dancing wasn't enough, every time they see each other it's as if they've been separated for ages. That happens sometimes when people are in love, but it doesn't make for a convincing or interesting screen dynamic. The plot itself isn't very convoluted: The oracle tells Neo he must find the Keymaker so he can take him to the Architect, a program that created the Matrix. Meanwhile, Agent Smith is replicating himself throughout the Matrix like a virus, and hellbent on killing Neo. It seems simple enough, however the way it is executed creates a confusing and distancing effect that makes the movie boring and often dull.The fights are among the biggest disappointments in this movie. While in the first film they were energetic and engrossing to watch, they now seem tired and overdone. The fight between Neo and the multitude of Agent Smiths is a major point of discontent. The fight drags on far too long of course, and there are also moments that are either entirely computer animated, or too much of it is used for it to be convincing. Neo at times moves too smoothly and and the detail of his clothes and face disappear, which moves the scene into the uncanny valley.But Reloaded has parts that are decent enough. The oracle and the Keymaker are interesting aspects, and the scene between Neo and the Architect is interesting. The scene with the Merovingian and Persephone is also very good. The Merovingian is a lusty and a moral Frenchman that is holding the Keymaker captive for some reason or another. His wife, Persephone, has grown tired of him and offers to help out the heroes, if Neo gives her a kiss to remind her what love feels like. The muddled themes of the movie are not better expressed than in this scene. True love, and being in control of one's own destiny, are major players throughout the series. Another interesting aspect brought up near the end of the film is that Neo discovers he has powers against the machines even in the real world, although this never really amounts to much.But where the movie falls apart completely and beyond repair is the car chase that happens towards the end of the film. At the excruciatingly long length of nearly fifteen minutes, the chase exhausts the small amount of faith one has left in the film. The chase is not even exciting or particularly different from any other car chase, other than the fact that it lasts longer than any other one before or since. As a result, it becomes a boring, headache inducing mess of a sequence, that does absolutely nothing to further the movie along. In fact, it brings the entire film to a grinding standstill as we are forced to watch fights on top of trucks, cars being destroyed, and unexplained ghost characters chasing around the good guys. There is nothing to look at other than the characters, unless you find yourself marveling at the hideous architecture of a highway. And as if the uninspired and crappy car chase wasn't enough, the movie drags on for another half hour before the ""To be Concluded"" sign pops up, in an apparent homage to Back to the Future Part II, maybe as a nod and a wink to say that it's all a big joke.The Matrix Reloaded is a failure of a movie, and it is only with the benefit of time to separate it from the immense disappointment it was when it first came out that this reviewer could find anything worth while in it. Instead of going back to the creativity and originality that spawned the first film, the Wachowski brothers created the biggest let down of the 21st century. They must have sold their souls to the Hollywood machine, because they made a movie that is cold, dull, and without a heart.thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This film is a high-cost version of a flying kung-fu movie with none of the humor and a stale plot.  This is not a movie, it's a marketing ploy.  How many times can we watch the same fight scene with the same (now cliche) slow-mo stop n' rotate camera effect?  How can anyone feel any sense of urgency or interest when all physics and reality have no meaning anymore?  How can we ever feel that any character is in danger when we it is impossible to tell if anything is actually dangerous?  Neo's essentially become a ridiculous black dress-wearing Superman, and I would assume the third movie will end with something as brilliant as Keanu Reeves flying around the world to reverse time.By the tenth or twelfth meaningless repeat of the same flying kung-fu scene any sane person above the age of 12 will be thinking about getting up and watching something more intellectually stimulating, like wrestling.  If you stripped all the meaningless scenes out of this movie and left nothing but the scenes that actually advance the plot or build characters you would probably have about 20 minutes of footage.""The Matrix"" was a decent movie.  It was not great, because it was anti-climatic.  It starts out with its best scene and is a slow slide from greatness to mediocrity throughout the rest of the film.  The idea of machines using humans for power is ridiculous and anyone with even the most basic understanding of physics can explain to you why it cannot possibly work.  However, the movie was at least somewhat fresh, entertaining, and self-contained.  ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is none of these things.  It is stale, dull, and a meaningless prelude to what promises to be more of the same.I no more believe that this was the planned middle chapter in a trilogy than I believe in the tooth fairy.  It is an obvious attempt to cash in on the first film two more times.  I, for one, will not be suckered into paying to see the next film  We should have learned our lesson about what film geniuses these guys are from their other masterpieces, ""Bound"" and ""Assassins"" -- more cliche crap.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In a sense, it's true... But in another sense, it's far from it...More explosive than ever, more spectacular, containing more action than the client could ask and far less satisfying than the first episode, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is nothing more than a very ordinary sequel...The story from this second act isn't set directly after the events of the first one, but some time after. The clues are rather obvious anyway. Neo (Keanu Reeves) already knows Zion very well and also its inhabitants, while at the end of the first movie, he hadn't set a single foot there before.To be more precise, I think that it is set six months after ""The Matrix"".The story from the second film follows Neo in his quest to destroy the Matrix. The Oracle (Gloria Foster) informs him that to get through with it, he must reach the Source, located on a building level where ""no elevator can go and no stair can reach"". But first, Neo has to find the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim), the only person who can give him the access to the door which leads to the Source.This mission will not be without any pitfall for Neo. The Keymaker is kept prisoner by a rogue program named Merovingian (Lambert Wilson), shaped as a Don Juan-like man who is obsessed with the French language at the point that he learns nearly every insult from it. Merovingian is surrounded by many more-or-less interesting henchmen who are not worth the potential of our favorite super-cool hero. Except two strange twins (Neil and Adrian Rayment) who can transform themselves into invincible ghosts. These two characters are undoubtedly the most interesting villains after Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving).And talking about Agent Smith, you thought he was dead, didn't you? Don't you believe it! Because he's back! He's as powerful as he was before, but he acquired the capacity of copying himself as many times as he pleases. This makes the matters even more difficult for Neo and the other protagonists.If you're the kind of viewer who got an eye on the action scenes in the first movie, then be sure that you won't get bored here. Because there's plenty of action here...The special effects used in the first movie all come back and they're usually upgraded by the Wachowski Brothers, so they can get to a superior level. After all, why would they change a winning formula? But there's an answer anyway: it's less surprising. The reason why ""The Matrix"" was so breathtaking is because the effects of bullet time and time-slicing appeared like something new and innovating. But what is done here is recycling...It seems that the Wachowski Bros. haven't learned from Stephen Sommers when he made ""The Mummy Returns"".In the first movie, the main dish in terms of action was the ultra-stylized slow-motion lobby fusillade, made to look like a John Woo movie sample. This time, the main dish is more conventional, because it's a high-speed pursuit on a busy freeway. Besides, it's the only scene from the movie that hasn't been shot in Australia, because it was actually shot in a specially-built highway in Alameda, California. The chase is spectacular and provides a lot of high thrills. However, it looked interminable to me.The first battle between Neo and the Agent Smith clones is also interminable. The fact that the Wachowskis experiment new kinds of figures to impress us is actually not-so impressive. By moments, you can also clearly see the artificial Neo doing the CG stunts. I think that we should not see those kinds of scenes, especially in such a movie, where advanced technology is the only true thing that drives the picture.But what truly strips the interest of ""The Matrix Reloaded"" from ""The Matrix"", it's the reject of addressing philosophical issues to the characters and viewers at the same time. ""The Matrix"" was interesting because of the numerous spiritual questions that it raised, most notably about the definition of reality. The second movie tries to redeem itself by giving to its characters the occasion of asking questions that are nearly impossible to understand and even less to answer, which doesn't fix anything up. ""The Matrix"" was complex, but it stayed sufficiently clear to be understood by the everyman and the everywoman. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is just too much difficult to catch.""The Matrix Reloaded"" is definitely spectacle-oriented. And in more ways than one...Not only are there really epic action sequences, but the sequence of the Zion cave is also made on a big scale, with hundreds, if not thousands of extras. We can see Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) pronouncing a speech reminiscent of Winston Churchill in the Battle of Britain, followed by a lengthy and perfectly useless sequence of dances and proto-primitive musics.In short, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is not a bad movie, but you must really be a big fan of the Matrix franchise to appreciate it.I don't know what the third movie will look like, because the first two were so different in style than we cannot really predict what will be retained. Ideally (and obviously), the best thing to do would be to combine the best elements from the first two pics, but it's easier to mean it than doing it.So, will Neo accomplish his destiny? Will everybody survive? Will humanity be victorious over the machines? To take an already well-known question: ""What is the Matrix... end?""","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

They just keeping going on and on about fate and choice and not much else. Most scenes involve a person standing here (or sitting) and another person standing there (or sitting) and discussing fate and choice. In the next scene they just use different words. It's tiresome. On top of this, the acting isn't so hot either. Then the final fate/choice scene just involves a guy using fancier words; you can some up what he actually says in about 30 seconds.I don't know about you, but I've been able to figure out the paradox of fate and choice just fine by myself, and I don't need this movie to tell me it's rather uncreative and unoriginal ideas about it....especially not over and over and over again.I really like the actual story-line, don't get me wrong, it is interesting, I want to see where they go with it, and the fight scenes are fantastic. However, I just wanted the movie to end...and it wouldn't. NEVER did I want either 'Lord of the Rings' movies to end....but they did.Overall, it's an okay flick. They should have cut out about 30 minutes of dialogue and it would have been better.

Indeed, this movie is the equivalent of the Wachowski brothers beating down the door to your house, getting you out of bed, and raping you. I could barely walk after watching half of this movie at home. I've heard scattered reports of people who saw it in theaters, who say they lost complete use of their legs. It's a pity, but it's these sorts of things that America can never forget. We all know that America has suffered through atrocities before: the influenza pandemic, the Hindenburg disaster, etc. However, in terms of total loss of human innocence, The Matrix Reloaded is far and away above them all.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

When it hit the screens back in 1999 I thought it was one of the most original Sci-Fi films I'd seen in many years. Visually, and stylistically, stunning. With guns and explosions, and the ultimate conspiracy theory - that the World that we live in was not real - that reality was a lie. Fast forward 4 years and along comes the ( belated ) sequel. At least somebody had the decency not to call it The Matrix II, so thank you for small mercies. Now, I have to be honest, when I saw the previews I wasn't overly confident that it would live upto the expectations of the original ( but then again, don't we feel that way about most sequels ? That in some way they'll dirty the name of the first film ?? Take a glance towards the Star Wars saga for proof of that ). However, I went to the cinema with an open mind. After all, it was my money and my time I was spending, and I wanted to have a good time.Oh dear !!I guess somebody must have told the W brothers that what the cinema going public wanted from a Matrix follow up was heaps more fighting, a 30 minute car chase and lashings of bullet time style FX - only more so, in an 'aren't we clever - look what we can do' kind of way. Granted the FX were very impressive, and were generally used to good ( ahem ) effect in each of the ( overly long ) set pieces. The fight with the numerous Agent Smiths was a highlight in my opinion, well for the first 3 or 4 minutes, then it just kept going on, and on, and on, and ... well you get the picture. Ditto the car chase. In fact ditto everything.The plot, which was strangely simple and yet so convoluted - like a bus journey between two towns, 5 miles apart, that takes in so many diversions you end up travelling for 10 times that distance - was nothing more than a paper thin device to link one elaborate stunt sequence to the next. But most of all, and perhaps most disappointingly, I just didn't care. It would have mattered not a jot who died, who lived, what happened to who. As a vehicle for ground breaking FX it was fine ( although I do have to add that though the FX were very good, they didn't have the grand scale of the recent LOTR films ). An MTV film, for an MTV audience.But a good film ? No, and certainly not a worthy sequel.One more thing to note - At the end of the film the directors had the chance to spring a real surprise on the audience. To hit them with a real ' I wasn't expecting that' moment. And for a minute I was thinking that at last they'd had the balls to do something really different.And then they bottled it.If you've seen the movie you'll know what I mean.

In this case, I feel that we are being strung out with a thin plot that really doesn't come to any tie-off, and just leaves us in the air. It's not even a cliff-hanger with building anticipation. Just a ""huh?"".I discounted reviews that I had heard or read where the comments inferred that this version didn't come up to the snaz of the original. That a tough nut to crack because the original was just that - original.  So I'm ready just to be entertained. Yeah, you're going to see lots of slow-mo action and bullet-time stuff, but that shouldn't be a surprise. And I'll even discount the ""deep"" philosophical stuff. Just take it for movie plot that's not going to reveal the true reasons for life, the universe, and everything.This isn't a trilogy, it's a two part-er, and we haven't been given the complete second part -just wait and pay for closure.  Each part of a trilogy should have a distinct subplot, with its own beginning and end. Sure the second part would raise a lot of questions and would seem disjoint if the first part was not seen. But that should only be in the context of the entire ensemble. And the end of the second should give the sense of more to come. But there should be some questions from the first and second parts that are answered. Think of Lord of the Rings or (the original) Star Wars. Some major plot phase is completed and some geographical location is changed.  Yeah, in Reloaded plot is some what hanging at the end of the movie, but when you think of it, it's is more hanging in the middle.The ending and way too long credits to get to a teaser is the directors self gratification at our expense in time and money. I could see this starting a ""Bad trends in Industry"" where only half a movie is shown.  ""Make 'em pay twice to see one movie"". And why are WE subjected to who you paid to feed you on location (et. al.) just to get to a teaser?.Since this is only 1/2 of a movie, I believe that it only gets 5/10. It's all because of MY control.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I liked the whole image and the philosophy behind it. But ""The Matrix Reloaded"" just doesn't live up to the hype. Sure, it's entertaining and it has great special effects, but it has so many other problems. The film score was horrible (it was like soap opera music), the acting was flat, the pacing was bad, and the story was weak in places.The movie desperately tried to develop a loving and intimate relationship between Neo and Trinity, but it failed miserably.  It didn't seem like they were truly in love.  The sex scene between them seemed like it was thrown in at the last minute and was completely void of any eroticism.  In fact, all the relationships in the film lacked chemistry.  Come on, these are the last humans of a machine world they should be full of chemistry!!!Now, I admit, they did a good job in extending the mystery of the Matrix. The scenes between Neo and the Oracle and Neo and the Architect were good. And a couple of the fights scenes were awesome, although some of the others were drawn out and unnecessary.  There is potential for surprises in the 3rd movie, which is good.  Hopefully, it will be better than this one.
Overall, I was greatly disappointed with ""The Matrix Reloaded"".  I'm sure tons of people will give this 10 stars and the movie will shatter all the box office records, but that just goes to show you that people are like drones, they believe what they hear and blindly follow the hype","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

At one point I'd been watching a fight for almost five minutes, got bored, went to the bathroom, got in line for candy, came back and watched it for another five minutes.  After a while you start to wonder if this isn't really just an advertisement for special effects, like ""woo-hoo, look at all the cool things we can do.""  But the story line was iffy and weak and aside from too much computerized fighting, there's also too much techno babble and a lot of talk that might make you start to drool and nod off  - note to viewers: when you get to the part where they're sitting down with the French guy, go for a LONG bathroom break.

They reloaded the Matrix... but it seems someone might have slipped some blanks in the chamber.Part of the Appeal of The Matrix was that it was new, fresh and undone before. Everything looked amazing, the storyline was unique, the acting tight, character development was well done... Lets face it, its not the best selling DVD in history for nothing.The Matrix Reloaded, however, lacks the newness and unique quality that the first film had. We're used to the camera filter now.. we're used to the fast paced action.. we're used to everything.. we're expecting it.. so when it happens, its not so much, ""Wow"" as, ""Ah there it is.""The director seems to over indulge the ""Matrix-Slow-Mo"" effect button thru-out the film, sometimes in seemingly the strangest pointless places.Agent Smith, aside from Hugo Weaving having a contract, seems almost un-needed in this film. If anything his character comes across as annoying and pointless and proves to be more irritating than anything else. He manages to go from Classic villain in the first film to over-used tired cliché in the sequel.Then there's the twins.You remember Star Wars: Episode 1, The Phantom Menace?You remember a really cool looking Martial arts based character by the name of Darth Maul? Funky as hell, full of promise.. had 1 or 2 really cool scenes, then without really ever developing or explaining his character they just gack him from the film?Its made doubly worse by the fact that there's *2* of them in this film.So by the time Neo comes face to face with the Architect, the film story line is becoming slightly hard to follow.. its unclear as to whether he's duping Neo or whether he's speaking the Truth.. but the Entire City of Zion is destroyed, *completely off camera*. No epic battles, no panning shots of wreckage, just, ""Yeah, everything's dead.""Nice.Don't get me wrong.. its pretty. Its a very pretty film. Hell, Neos costume alone kicks some serious ass and I'll probably go see the film again *just* because its playing in the Uptown Cinema 1 (IN THX Affliction :-P), because for some reason I didn't see it there the first time and I'm sure I must have missed *some* saving grace I missed.The plot is very formulaic however. If you've _ever_ played any RPG game, you'll recognize it immediately. Neo is sent, get this, to retrieve the Keymaker. Then its minion fight, boss fight, minion fight, cut scene, minion fight, recover this item, return that item, cut scene, boss fight, roll credits.I've heard nothing but good things about the Matrix video game that was released with a storyline that runs concurrent to the movie plot, and its script is 3 times longer than the film.As for Ms. Pinkett Smith... her presence in the film reminds me very much of Storm from the First X-men film.Overall I was disappointed by the film, the prettiness and neat stuff didn't really make up for the short comings of what was a hugely hyped yet somewhat disappointing film. Notwhere near as good as the first film, certainly not as good as the 2 Towers, but not quite as bad as Attack of the Clones.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The most recent example of course being the Terminator movies and Skynet. Same premise as the Matrix except that humans have to give the energy off to feed the Matrix. So that being said, the storyline in the Matrix leaves a lot to be desired.Secondly the FX of the movie will be considered groundbreaking for a few years at least. They will be copied and duplicated a ton until you get sick of seeing it. The high point of the movie is the fight between Neo and Agent Smith(s). However this has been done in other formats already most notably this Sure the last part of the stick figure fight borrows from the first movie but all in all it is basically the same. As well the ""kung fu"" of the movie if you will has been done to death in many Asian movies as well and in way better form I might add. The chase scene on the freeway is decent but again the reliance on special FX to carry the movie really detracts from the whole thing.Third the acting in the movie has really never been very strong. Aside from the hot Carrie Anne Moss, the rest of the cast gives a pretty soso performance. Lawrence Fishburne is back as the monotone Morpheus. He would be ok but his speeches go on and on and on. But by far Keanu Reeves is the worst of the whole lot. I still cannot picture him as any thing other than the guy from Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, and his delivery of lines fits in perfectly with that picture.All in all I thought that the movie was soso. The FX gets a thumbs up, though fight choreography is hard to be original with. Storyline is neutral, it does borrow from the Terminator series, though with the added twist of humans powering the machines. But by far the acting is the worst part of the whole thing. The actors are stiff and delivery is barebones.
Rating from me is 5 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It may be unfair to compare the two movies as The Matrix was, in my view, a great movie which both aroused the curiosity and fascinated. Unfortunately The Matrix Reloaded has no radically new special effects to save it, while the effects are incredible impressive, they are just more of the same. More of the same times one hundred, but without a plot to support this amazing action, the movie surprisingly becomes a bit tedium. There are glimpses of a existential plot, but the supporting sub-plots are not left to develop and ultimately this leaves the movie disjointed.I can credit the creators of Reloaded with trying to offer us more. In my opinion though it should have been more plot. For the plot supplies the intrigue, which in turn make the effects not only amazing, but also moving.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Then it hit me, halfway home. I had not actually seen a movie. I'd seen a Mighty Mouse cartoon.The flight scenes in ""Reloaded."" Were they really necessary? What does it mean that Neo can fly? That he's God? That he's Superman? That he is, in fact, Mighty Mouse? Why is there a Superman reference early in the film? Are the creators of the movie aware that they are ripping off a milestone in American popular culture?I think Neo can fly because A) it presents the opportunity for more gee-golly special effects scenes and B) it allows for giant plot conveniences. Nothing more. Neo never flies when it might actually do him some good, say, to escape 250,000 or so replicas of Agent Smith.Those replicas. Why the heck are they necessary? Why does Agent Smith keep making copies of himself? He still can't whip Neo! He still does the same ole chop-socky thing! And where do they all go, once Neo has ""done his Superman thing""? Hang out at the mall? Shop for new sunglasses? Sip lattes? What?The dude at the end, in the room w/ all the TV screens. I'm sorry, but he literally stopped the movie to make a speech that had me squirming with intense boredom. Frankly, I didn't know what the guy was talking about or why it mattered. Why didn't Neo just chop-socky him? Or fly away sooner, the better to escape the boredom?I know. This is all just a set up for yet another sequel, which is refreshing, in this Year of the Sequel. But you know what? ""Matrix Reloaded"" was so bad, so incomprehensible, such a boring, story-free zone, that I don't care anything at all about ""Revolutions."" Chris Reeve could drop in for a cameo, and I wouldn't care.If it weren't for ""The Return of the King,"" my mantra would be ""Death to CGI."" THAT is how much I hated ""Matrix Reloaded.""","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Matrix combined an excellent and philosophically interesting plot (extreme skepticism & philosophy of mind being particularly relevant), excellent special effects and action sequences with deadpan acting that actually worked beautifully.  Unfortunately, none of these aspects that made the original film great carried over to The Matrix Reloaded.  Reloaded is filled with important sounding ramblings that really have very little philosophical merit (and I say this with a B.A. in philosophy -currently in a PhD program).  The action sequences fail for the following reasons: 1) they are too long.  The sequences go on for such length that I was bored... bored! By an action sequence!  2) The special effects are overused (bullet-time, etc.) to the point that they seriously detracted from my enjoyment of the effect and of the action scenes in general.  3) Ahh hell... I'm tired of writing: the action scenes are ridiculous - terrible direction, predictable (morpheus hangs off edge of truck by his fingers - twice in the same fight!).  Finally the acting here has taken a turn for the worse along with the script.  Some scenes are overly long (zion rave comes to mind), and many are unnecessary and slow down the pace of the film. Oh, and BTW the ending of this film isn't really an ending at all - it just cuts off mid plot point to force you to see the third movie.  Overall I give this film 3/10 - go rent the original instead.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Rating:R (Stylized Action/Violence, and a Scene of Sexuality/Nudity) Grade:C-*Yes I do realize I will get stoned to death for saying this. The Completely unnecessary sequel to The Matrix (1999) brings back Keanu Reeves as Neo. In the first film; Neo was learning that he was destined to be `the one'. The One would supposedly free the people of the city of Zion, and fight the machines who harvest the humans for there source of energy. While I was a huge fan of the first film (which isn't saying much, seeing as this sequel is so incredibly different) I did not like the sequel because of its lack of vision, and also it seemed too much like a video game. It is also a great example of the age old saying that; just because it has a larger budget doesn't mean its better. What was so fresh about the original was the fact that it was all very cloak and dagger type stuff. You didn't see the city of Zion at all, or the Episode I type council of philosophical malcontents. For all you knew the only people who actually lived outside the matrix, was the crew of the Nebacanezar. The original left so much to the imagination. The sequel pulls off the sheets and shows you everything, saying; this is what it's really like outside the matrix, you know now, it's too bad if you don't like it. Not to mention, the Zion rave scene that goes on for an astounding 15 minutes or so. In this scene people dance in a ritualistic fashion, and jump up and down in bullet time, while beads of sweat pour off there dreadlocks. What's also a major let down is the lack of guns, and sufficient coherent battles. In fact instead of Neo and others engaging in gritty brutal fights with agents and SWAT team members, there engaging in long and boring philosophical conversations, that are just there to sound smart. Not to mention the fact that when there is action, it either makes absolutely no sense, or is just sprinkled in at random. There is one particularly brainless scene, which involves Neo vs. about 50 Agent Smiths. In that scene Neo and the Agent Smiths, engage in hand to hand combat for 20 minutes or so for no apparent reason. Why do they fight if; Neo can just fly away, and Agent Smith just keeps making more of himself? One of the biggest problems when compared to the original is the fact that there is so little at stake. Except for the fact that the machines will eventually attack Zion, there's really no thrill. I mean if Neo can fly, and bend reality, and stop machines with his bare hands, and beat the s*** out of countless people, does he really have anything to worry about. Not to mention that if anyone were to die, Neo can just turn there heart back on like a light switch. The acting in Reloaded is average. With the exception of Carrie Anne Moss (Trinity), and Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith) who lighten up the screen, everyone else has a straight face, and walks around like they just had a lobotomy. Also, the presence of Joe Pantoliano (Cypher) is surely missed, he really added allot of energy to the first one. Reloaded in the end, does act as a guilty pleasure. It is entertaining to a degree, but is that what I really want in a seemingly intelligent Sci-Fi epic. Granted, Reloaded does have its occasional inspired moment, and it has allot of hints and ideas that; signal things to come. In the end though The Matrix 'Bloated' (no that's not a typo), is a poorly constructed bridge between the beginning and the end, of a trilogy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The reason these two movies blew the audience away was because of their visual breakthrough.  `Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope' was loved by everyone and was a hit at the box office while the BEST Star Wars Film `The Empire Strikes Back' will only be the second best.  Both, `Episode IV: A New Hope' and `The Matrix' set the basis for their next two installments.  `Episode IV: A New Hope' ended on a happy note, because as far as the audience was concerned, the Death Star wars destroyed and the day was saved by some boy who seems to have some Jedi powers, but is only a good pilot.  Similar to Episode IV, The Matrix ended on happy note because at the end Neo realizes that he is the one' and he has great powers within the Matrix and can do as he pleases. Now that we have set a base for the story, we can continue with the story WITHOUT going back and explaining everything again.  `Lord of the Rings  The Fellowship of the Ring' had a VERY similar pattern to the Matrix and Star Wars Trilogy, and most people had the same complains about the second part of the trilogy: `Too much action, not enough story, not enough character development, not based on the book, etc'.  My point is, that when something comes out of the blue and the audience is unaware of it, then it's liked, but when something is hyped and well known, there will be a great chance of most people complaining about the movie.Some of the dumbest complains I have EVER heard about a trilogy: For those who think that every sequel should be a stand-alone; I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way.  At the end of Empire Strikes back, Luke finds out what is really going on, Hutt kidnaps Han, and the ENTIRE story has a completely different twist to it and the movie ends without answering A LOT of questions.  The Matrix Reloaded does the EXACT same thing as The Empire Strikes Back, it ends a point when the story I getting most interesting: that point is called the climax!Purpose of a trilogy: In a trilogy, the second movie will always end with many unanswered questions and unexplained actions.  That's the entire point of making three parts to a story: you can tell a LONG story in three parts without cutting out too much of it.  Imagine all three Lord of the Rings books, all six Star Wars Episodes and all the Harry Potter books in one movie!  It would be awful!  Therefore, if there are unanswered questions and unexplained actions in Reloaded then they WILL be explained in the next one.  Again, that is the point in making a trilogy: tell a long story without cutting out the detail! I am sick and tired of people complaining that this movie ended without an explanation.  Doesn't anyone hit them with the stupid stick and tell them that part three of this movie will be out the SAME YEAR!Other trilogies: [since everyone is comparing The Matrix to every other trilogy that's been out!]: Just like other big hit and successful trilogies such as: Back to the Future, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars [4-6, before Lucas decided to screw it all up!], Matrix Revolutions will finish off the story by explaining all the cliffhangers from Reloaded. As far as I am concerned, the Wachowski Brothers are the ONLY one to do that; release part three of a trilogy the same years as the sequel!Conclusion: Either way, this was a great sequel, one of the best I've seen I might add, and I have no doubt that part three [THE CONCLUSION  for those who don't realize that part three will concluded everything!] will be another great cinema experience just like the previews two.The Matrix: 9/10  -- The Matrix Reloaded : 8/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This film does have some stunning action sequences and some genuinely imaginative cinematic viewpoints and effects. I just couldn't help thinking that it would have been so much better if they had concentrated on the plot, rather than trying to win on sheer scale. There is precious little humour to leaven the pomposity and faux-philosophising that seems to have infected the entire cast and the overall effect is false and alienating. When we are presented with the last vestiges of the human race in Zion, it would be nice to feel some sense of identity with them. Instead, the scenes of mankind's final evening before the massed sentinals attack is about as comfortable as a Nuremburg rally.Unless we find in the third installment that the joke is how like the machines mankind has become, the lack of warmth or humanity in the film is disturbing. Yes, there are the assorted love interests, but in each case, the participents come across as motivated more by self interest than their partner's wellbeing (it's all ""how will *I* be affected when you die a horrible death in the line of duty""). There's precious little here to make us care whether mankind survives or falls, which makes the film appear unpleasantly abstract and heightens the sense that all the discourses on the meaning of self and identity have become so much empty posturing. Peel off a mask on one of these characters and you suspect that you'll have a clear view to the back of their head.Finally, and perhaps most irksomely, the film doesn't seem to advance either the characters or our understanding anywhere near enough to justify its runtime. You could get the important scenes, with enough action to keep most fans pretty damned happy into a one hour TV special, including adverts. Hell, at a pinch, you could condense all the real information that you're given about the Matrix, it's creator and it's purpose into the space that Star Wars gave to describing a galaxy far, far away and tag it on to the beginning of the final movie.Disappointing?

I watched it when it was first released and since then I still haven't seen the third installment. Frankly, this pile of shite put me off.The acting is terrible (particularly Keanu), the effects look a bit silly and the script is pretentious rather than intelligent. For the record, the architect is awful, even if it does make sense. You could film me reading from the phone book for two hours and it would make sense, but it wouldn't be very entertaining would it? How many times does one man have to use the word 'ergo' in one sentence? It seems as if the architect scene is attempting to compensate for the lack of plot up to that point.The fanboys say this film is intelligent, but so is A bout de Soufflé and it's still far more entertaining than the drivel that is Matrix Reloaded. Also, let's not be under the impression that this film was about anything other than making money. The numerous tie-ins and the huge budget are all the proof you need. So with this in mind, this film should have been about entertainment, not pseudo-philosophical twaddle. Then there's the sex scene, which is overdone and not very pleasant viewing really.The Matrix Reloaded fails as a movie, but as a talking point for the sci-fi obsessed, it succeeds. It's like someone gave a couple of 14 year old Dungeons & Dragons nerds £100 million and told them to make a film. Like a private joke, those that are in on it think it's fantastic, while the rest of us are left wondering what all the fuss is about.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Having that said to Keanu Reeves was so ironic that it came across as a joke.When it comes down to it, no matter what you whip your bum with, its still sh*t.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"2","/10","A triumph of facades and pressure-marketing over substance","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704137/?ref_=tt_urv","mentalcritic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0821456/?ref_=tt_urv","21 May 2003","I've been on holidays with my family up in Queensland for a while, and when I get bored enough, I just have to go and see films. It was two for $10 night at the local theatre, and since I had seen everything I actually wanted to see, my father insisted that we go and see what I like to call The Mushtrix Rehashed. We might as well have flushed that $10 down the nearest toilet, for a number of reasons.I tried to go in with an open mind. No, really, I did - what else can you do when you want to be entertained? I said to myself that I would respect this sequel if it managed to justify its own existence in terms of storytelling. Well, guess what? I didn't even accomplish that much. Talk about going in with low expectations and not even having them fulfilled.I think the most telling moment, however, was when the fight sequences only used slow motion for a handful of seconds and yet we still got bored with them. During the moment when Neo first fights Smith, I turned to my dad and asked him if I was supposed to do something with a control pad. A later comment that he made was that just about every sequence in the film went on past its welcome. Which reminds me, was the pathetic camera-work meant to hide the fact that the writers still haven't gotten past plaigirising Once Upon A Time In China?I think that summed up most of the film, in fact. Not only that, but how are you meant to give a stuff about characters and whether they win fights or not when the rules of victory are never defined? You could put these agents in blocks of concrete and drop them into the ocean, but they'd still say ""ha! I'll have this body now!"". It is childish and insulting to the intelligence. Not even Star Trek overuses Plot Crowbars such as Deus Ex Machina this much. Now that Star Trek: Nemesis has killed the Trek franchise, will we be remembering telephones in twenty years time as the ultimate Deus Ex Machina? Or Neo?Whatever you do, don't get me started on the sequences within Zion. I just hope that Plato is spinning in his grave hard enough to add a slight eccentricity to this planet's orbit. I'm also willing to bet messers Wachowski were also a little too receptive to certain scenes with Christopher Lee during The Two Towers. And I will say this only once - you know a film is in trouble when key action sequences remind one of The Fast And The Furious. Have these guys ever had an original idea?I also find it quite painful when people praise this cinematic abortion as a masterwork while pointing out The Phantom Menace's or Attack Of The Clods' wretched dialogue at every opportunity. The only writer who compares to Lucas or Whackoffski's obvious lack of knowledge about how human beings really speak or form linguistic traits is Shakespeare. I remember having an incredible urge to get out of my seat and scream ""speak naturally!"" at half the cast. But then, what can you expect when the lead hero plays his roles all the same way - like a coffee table?On a slightly more positive note, at least they kept the masturbatory contemporary music out until the end credits. Unfortunately, the number they do choose is so utterly pathetic that it makes me shed a tear for the fact that a film that is supposed to somehow praise the beauty of individualistic thought only serves to remind me how much we've all lost an important aspect of our freedom. This boring load of over-hyped, overrated rubbish honestly couldn't have been more upsetting if the theatre was required to seatbelts in their chairs. Since the IMDb rating system does not allow a score of zero, I gave The Matrix Rehashed a two out of ten. It is not even bad enough to be entertaining. It is just plain tried.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I am not the biggest action movie fan but I enjoyed The Matrix when it came out back then. It was an action movie that - despite its flaws - tried to come up with an interesting storyline. It was visually fresh and made an immediate impact in popular culture. The sequel is plain crap. The Wachowski brothers seemed to be contend with just copying themselves. Whenever they tried to introduce something new outside the action scenes it reliably backfires. Scenes like the one in which Morpheus delivers one of the most pathetic speeches in film history that transforms a frightened congregation into a rave party make me cringe. Not to forget the most cliché ridden rendering of a frenchman (yeah, yeah he's a program blabla) ever. According to this movie evil frenchies can prepare/ program a mousse au chocolat that is so filled with wickedness that vaginas of unassuming women will explode. Well monsieur, that demands satisfaction! Inretaliation we will smash your house full of achievements of french culture to pieces! Who's your daddy now?My advice: Cut out some of the decent action scenes (mass brawl, freeway) slap a good soundtrack on it and show it on MTV. Bin the rest. Do not demand money for it. Put the Wachowski brothers on probation.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What I can't accept is that the non-action parts were crap.  Every time Morpheus opened his mouth, I knew I was in for a speech that went on forever and signified nothing.I was also disappointed with the little plot that did exist.  What this movie did was tell us that there was no truth in the first movie (except about the existence of the matrix).

But . . . . . . I was extremely disappointed in the orgy and sex scene with Neo and Trinity.  Associating supposedly spiritual characters with such a scene is offensive enough, but it was pure sex and had nothing to do with the plot. BTW, sex and love are not synonymous, a concept that was apparently lost on the producer.The first Matrix movie's appeal to me with its deep undertones and profound plot was not carried over with this sequel.  The producer obviously didn't feel the need to dilute the first story line with extraneous sex scenes just to get an ""R"" rating.  And The Matrix was a definite success.
The Matrix Reloaded took a wrong turn when it included the orgy scene. What would have been an excellent movie was ruined with that one scene.  I don't need to watch other people have sex, thank you very much.  That is not what The Matrix story is all about.Finally, the ending was abrupt and a disappointment.  The atmosphere in the theater at the end was unanimous:  we were all let down.Yes, the special effects are extraordinary, and Neo does show his incredible giftings, but his character takes a wrong turn as do most of the characters in this sequel to a most excellent first movie, The Matrix.Disappointed in CT","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first Matrix movie asked ""What is the Matrix?""  After watching this one, I ask ""Who the H*** cares?"" There was absolutely no story, and all of of the drawn out CGI Kung-Foolery can't cover that up.  The overacting was painful to watch, especially when they're spouting out such hokey dialouge so horribly written that it makes Jar Jar Binks look like Shakespeare.  Burdoning the film with all of this philosophical mumbo jumbo and technobabble is supposed to make them sound smart, sophisticated, worldly, worth to be saved from the machines. Guess what, it doesn't work.  Zion was so irritating, I want to see the machines destroy it.  The muddy rave was cheezy, and the tacked on sex scene was hardly sexy.  The set piece of the film is a 14 minute car chase that felt like 41 minutes, and more than anything else it was boring.  All the fights are boring because you know Neo is going to win.  Maybe I want more out of my entertainment than thoughtless fake looking eye candy.  The ""bullet time"" effect that was so innovational for 1999 has been done to death through parody and tribute that now it looks old.  The ""cliffhanger"" drove the final nail into the coffin, enough for me not to care about Revolutions in November.  It's too bad a good movie has to be polluted with subpar sequels. It's also too bad that Son Of The Beach isn't on anymore, their Matrix parody was silly but would have been a much better sequel than this thing.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Anyone who adored the first film - and that was pretty much everyone who saw it - was eager for the second, hoping against hope that it wouldn't be a let down.And what a let down. Morpheus has become the reverse of his character from the first film. There is no tension, no threat (just who the hell could harm Neo now?) and even the rebels are starting to take on the agents - upgraded agents, no less, and survive, if not win! Remember Trinity's warning to Neo in the first film? Bear no mind to it for this.Smith, too, has become a joke. The much-applauded virus-like smith scene with him replicating himself over and over to battle Neo, is, well frankly silly.Whereas the first film was clever, but purposeful, Reloaded smacks of being complicated for complicatedness' sake. The much discussed Architect's speech, for example, is neither profound, nor deep, just very very heavy, in the worst possible sense. And for a film that is only supposedly one half of a much larger film, it's all a bit long winded.But that all said and done, it's still not as bad as people are claiming... and I'm not being hypocritical here. The film-making is astounding, and the special effects are second to none. But the characterizations, and the storyline are a little pat, especially when held in comparison to the first film.Part of the problem with it being an epic split in two pieces (apart from being a rip-off) is that it is impossible to judge this film entirely on its own merits. All of its failings may be accounted for... but then again, they may not.As a stand-alone film (even apart from the first) Reloaded isn't a lot of cop, except to watch the mindless [in the characters own eyes] action. Four out of ten.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That was the feeling I probably shared with a lot of other ppl out there standing in line to get a ticket.Loaded up on candy, snacks and coke I entered my seat preparing to be blown away. I realized that a sequel to such a grand movie as THE Matrix could not be done with ease, but this is FAR below the first movie.First of all; WTF was that sh*te with all the ppl dancing in zion about? A 5 minute propaganda sequence to do drugs and attend raves? And Morpheus's little speach? It felt a LOT like; -""doh, lets copy the speach in Independence day, it'll work for sure!"". BUT SORRY! It just felt pathetict! Wrong place, wrong crowd, wrong character and extremly  bad timing.After this we got 'bout an hour of quite good fighting which was nice, but sadly Agent Smiths return felt a little bit thin. Recycling Code? Have the Wachowski brothers even seen code first of all? Everything in the Matrix is code, nothing excists there in reality (at least thats the way I figure it); its just virual.  Its numbers, figures and letters not a beer-can. BAH!!There is a lot of other insidents and pieces of the story that I could complain about, but I will not. 2 angry right now. I'll just give a short summary.MANY mean effects (gotta give 'em credit for that). SOME Nice fights (some just felt 2 predictable). WAY to thin story (just felt ""empty"" when leaving the cinema). WAY to much meaningless chatter with no real content. BAD music (compared to THE Matrix). THE WORST ENDING EVER! (Felt like watching a episode of the X-files)Finally I can almost smell the way Matrix #3 will turn out. A lot of gunfights against the sentinels (Alien 2 style) and the final cut will be NEO and some other humans standing on a hill watching out over a scorched earth in the sunset.

And I thought it didn't need a sequel of any kind. But then again I knew, that because the film was a hit there would be at least one. And there was two.Reloaded has a nice beginning, after that the movie falls flat on its face and churns itself as a tensionless pseudo philosophical mumbo jumbo about Jesus wannabe Neo (Reeves) and his prophet Morpheus (Fishburne) and Neo's apostle Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss). And of course Mr. Smith (Hugo Weaving), the evil agent extraordinare. The biggest problem of the film is total lack of tension: as Neo is this godlike being in the matrix you know, that no matter what, he prevails and that makes the film as tedious to watch as a computer game when you are not playing it. The second problem comes directly from the philosophy of the film: in where the first Matrix the whole thing was more of an existentialism view on world, in Reloaded it all turns out as a bad religious (mainly Christian) reference. It's far too obvious, that The Wachowski Brothers were trying to create something similar to Star Wars.Reloaded turned me off so efficiently, that I still haven't seen the last instalment of the series from the reason I really don't want to. I doubt it will get any better.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film is beautiful to look at and offers up a convoluted plot that after some initial dragging (including an embarrassingly out of place extended dance sequence) takes off at an accelerated pace. It introduces some interesting characters and puts all the players through a physical and mental wringer. After Morpheus makes all his dour pronouncements and a new character, the Architect gives an amazingly incomprehensible speech, the audience is left to wonder just what the @#$% is actually going on. That might be fun for some, for others not, but regardless the movie somehow failed to create any imperative in me to figure all this out. I never really feared for any of the principles and as one crisis after another was announced then knocked down I noted that the tension level, least for me, didn't really change.

It was suspenseful, full of twists and turns that this half-hearted, half-baked sequel is missing.  From the awkward back of the band bus make-out shots of Neo and Trinity to the dud of a cliff hanger ending, this movie left me empty.  The fight scenes and special effects that are most often mentioned in the surprising number of positive review don't provide a punch because there is no suspense.  Watching them reminded me of watching someone else play a video game. For over two hours. Yes, its got spectacular graphics, but its not a lot of fun just sitting there, is it? I'm not even going to go into the inconsistencies in Matrix logic regarding Neo's super-powers and his choice(?) to now use them to defeat his enemies. I think that I'm not alone in thinking that the third film of the trilogy (due out later this year) will tank as direct result of the mess.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Laurence Fishburne needs to lose some weight. Period. Interestingly enough this movie looks like it was made before the original Matrix film. Blade and Bladerunner had a child and they called it Matrix Reloaded. While some of the visual stuff is pretty well done other shots are simply poor.Every time they do the shot overlooking Zion I can't help but wonder if they actually still use mate paintings? Some other scenes don't look too good either.Seeing this at a pre-screening I might have guessed that they were still working on the film. I paid 7.50 for this one so that doesn't seem to be an option.Won't say anything about the story, things are being moved forward plotwise, but until Revolutions there is really no way of making final conclusions on all of this. Anyone saying otherwise is imagining things.In short, too many fight scenes that do get boring, too much of most things, too little atmosphere, too many side characters..., the horrible Zion Megarave featuring Stomp and the sweaty Cavepeople...The worst moments had me seeing Jerry Bruckheimers Name written on them.There is lot of effort in this flick, no doubt, but I'm hoping for a better third act.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first time (and only, as far as I'm concerned) I saw this sequel, I was bored, amused and disgusted by turns.What was an interesting kernel of an idea in the first film has been extended way beyond what it should be in Reloaded.  Drawing the story out (what there is of it) over 3 films is only making apparent just how slim the plot is - lots of poofery around a good idea and meandering around, taking its own sweet time to conclude.  Even though the story lines are very different, I can't help but compare it to Lord of the Rings.  LOTR is taut with an objective in mind, whereas Neo just keeps kicking (and now flying *snort*) his way around with new story threads coming up all the time to explain this or that, or just to muddy the comprehension waters for the hell of it.  From what I understood, he's really the sum total of program anomalies that has a cyclical life.  If I cared, I would go to the theater is a few weeks to see how it is all wrapped up, but Reloaded had me rolling my eyes so much that I doubt I'll even part with the $5.25 matinee fee. If there is even a scintilla of repeats of the Zion bongo fest and the interminable and repetitive fight choreography, I'll never watch it.As a fanfic writer (in the LOTR fandom), I am so tempted to send a Mary Sue Litmus Test to the Wachowski Brothers, asking them to run Neo through it. It'd be interesting to see what score they come up with. (I got a 37, with 35+ being a hopeless Sue).  Odd that I didn't notice Neo's Sue-ish qualities in the first movie, but after seeing Reloaded, they are so apparent. Bringing Trinity to life (with the 'ole heart squeeze trick *snicker*), flying, having all those other uber-superpowers, being ""the One"" in a prophecy, etc. etc. etc ad nauseum.  So perfect and powerful it's ridiculous.  He's an embodiment of what people wish they could be.  I.E., a perfect Mary Sue.In all fairness, however, I did give it a 3 - but only for Hugo Weaving. But even you couldn't save it, Hugo baby.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

To sit through a special-effects-induced Cadillac advertisement with way too many forced 'lovey-dovey' scenes added in as filler.  This movie was a disappointment to me, but not the worst movie I've ever seen.  I enjoyed the fight scenes, I enjoyed the car-chase scene, I enjoyed the computer-enhanced special effects.  I did not enjoy seeing Keanu Reeves's naked butt, nor did I enjoy the way-too-long 'tribal-dance-scene' or whatever that was.  It seemed the creators were trying to fill in the sections between action scenes with gooey filler scenes and rhythmic music.  There were some (seemingly) artificial attempts a plot development, and there were some re-used effects from the first movie (the slo-mo bullets creating shockwaves, the 'karate kid' crane kick stopped in mid-air, etc).I must say that my expectations might have been a little inflated due to the (in my opinion) overwhelming success of the first movie.  I can't even count how many times I've seen the first one.  So, I might be a little harsh here. I think this movie could have been at least 30 min shorter by cutting out all the fluff-and-puff scenes that had no bearing on the outcome (like the naked Keanu scene).  I would give this movie 4.5 out of 10 -- just a smidge below 'middle' but definitely not   to the point of 'unseeable'.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

For the entire 2 hours and 18 minutes, the computer generated actions and sound effects take up 80% of the show. The animated scenes are fun to watch especially the highway chasing. No doubt the Wachowski brothers have created an astonishing movie in visual effect that may not be easily replicated by others. Unfortunately, I'm a fan of Matrix's story more than its visual technology. Obviously younger people have a total opposite view than mine - i.e. my daughter and son (11 and 13 year old). Well, I didn't let my kids see the original Matrix until last year (it's R rated, you know.) and they were so thrilled about the actions but knew little of the story - which they didn't care. For this reason, I have not decided whether I should let them see the 'Reloaded'. Another thing is that they've seen too many similar movies already - from Harry Potter to Lord of The Rings, Spiderman to X-Man; it's no big deal any more. Just to give an example, we watched 'Shoalin Soccer'  the other day; they were not surprised of those super soccer maneuvers and skills at all, but my wife . oh boy, she was amazed! She insisted that the soccer actions were real performance until I showed her the 'Make of the movie' which revealed the CAD of those super soccer scenes.So what about the story of 'Reloaded'? My opinion - it is just too complicated for my little human brain to digest. Why the machines can create Matrix - a virtual world that is so real and powerful but can not stop Neo from breaking in? Why there are so may security systems and failed proof power grids just to prevent human (Neo) to break in? This is more like a video game than movie. For game it needs no sense, only rules. So for people who are looking for reasons, you'll be disappointed; but for game lovers, this is just a prelude for the video game 'Enter the Matrix'.For those Keanu's fans, he is still the same old Keanu Reeves - perhaps a little bit too mature. No comments for other actors.So what's left for human?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

One, this movie is being viewed as a single entity - if it has greater strengths within the trilogy is not under discussion.  As this is not literature (as in some books the series gains greater strengths as a whole, where each book may not have the same impact) but film the subject is looked at in this way.  Two, I have reviewed the movie on multiple occasions and do find it more appealing now than when first viewed, but the overall rating and feel are what is actually being commented upon.There are a few concerns with this movie that are both very important to the films success and at the same moment terribly superficial.Audio: Audio is important to any film - however, in this movie in particular the audio expectations were quite high as it relates to the original release.  This statement is not in contradiction to my previous caveat as I am not discussing the strength of the series, but the expectation created concerning the language that is used to illustrate the complete story-line.  The language of the Matrix.  In Reloaded, the audio work is really sub-par.  Which in all is a little surprising as most of the key people returned for the second film.  The low-key foley work and mediocre nondiegetic music make the fight scenes a complete train wreck.  In no way a comparison to the heightened anticipation felt from the language of the first film.  You don't feel the scenes, you watch them.Did we really need that...: Well, this is just a plot thing.  Did we really need the Bacchanal in Zion?  Don't get me  wrong there were some nice images from this scene. The thing is that is brought the  film down a notch or two on its own. It seemed like a pitch to sell the film.  Put a little  sex in and everyone is happy.I am going to leave it at that.  There is a lot more that could be said, but I figure I am over my 1000 words already...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That film had a great combination of great action scenes and genuinely intelligent plot and ideas with some depth. The only way I can describe Reloaded is that it looks like and has all the emotional attraction of watching the Wachowski brothers playing the most impressive video game in the world, but refusing to let any but the most obssesive of Matrix fans into their world. What I mean by this is that the philosophy/mythology side of this is so pompous and incomprehensible that you don't particularly know and therefore care what's happening onscreen. Yes the fight scenes, though often repeated with little basic variation, are visually impressive, but in an overtly ""wow check out the new CGI"" way. However they rarely forward the story. I have a feeling that it could've been so much better with a smaller sfx budget, that way we could've had a few amazing set-pieces that would've had to forward the story and maybe a bit more attention to the script. There are some good new characters introduced such as the Twins ,Merovingian, Keymaker, the stunning Monica Bellucci as Persephone but these aren't given time for any real development. Maybe Revolutions can redeem the trilogy later in the year, I hope so!Verdict: If you're expecting an intelligent, intelligible sequel you will be disappointed, which is a great shame as the potential for an amazing trilogy was present. If you just want to see a rollercoaster of spectacle after spectacle, but couldn't care less about the dialogue, plot or characters, or you know the mythology inside out and can work out what's going on you'll probably love it, and fair enough.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first movie was kind of cool, but the story was by far not that new - to be honest, reality not being reality has been a well known Science Fiction concept for over 50 years.But there had to be a sequel - big money was waiting. So no matter how thin the story was in the first installment of this series - the Wachowski Brothers succeeded in providing even less story and putting together a movie which consists of two main ""devices"":
While the action sequences in spite of their seeming endlessness sometimes had an entertaining element in them, the monologues really made me (and many viewers around me as I could hear) yawning. I still can hardly believe what a huge amount of total gibberish the Wachowskis expect us to swallow in Matrix: Reloaded. It seemed that every time they did not know how to explain what was going on, they chose to say: ""It's destiny"".  But when you sit in a movie theatre and have to listen to ridiculous characters from Jacques Chirac to Sigmund Freud talking about nothing but destiny - then that particular story device is certainly overused... and the Rocky Horror Picture Show comes to mind: ""Booooooring!""All in all I was very disappointed and totally unnerved.

I thought the car chase scene was going to be spectacular, but it was so drawn out that it ended up being no better than average. The acting was wooden and the plot was basically a mish-mash of popular philosophy tied together with dialogue written through the aid of a thesaurus. Most of the dialogue in The Matrix Reloaded tries to be overly complex, resulting in a whole lot of circular reasoning fallacies. While I never truly enjoyed any scene in the film, the dialogue with Merovingian was mildly entertaining. And then there's the worst scene in the entire film, the rave/sex scene. Absolutely terrible. It served no purpose whatsoever. That scene alone had me hoping for the destruction of Zion right from the start.Nothing gets accomplished in the duration of this film. By the time the movie has ran its course, nothing is solved, and basically the whole 2 hours were worthless. Yes, I understand that this is a trilogy, but this whole movie didn't do anything except wax philosophical in between CGI kung fu scenes. Overall, The Matrix Reloaded was a very mediocre film that doesn't even begin to touch its predecessor.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, all the excitement is layered over great heaping piles of stereotypes over what the ""future"" will be like.Like a large number of other science fiction and fantasy movies, such as Strange Days, The Crow movies, and many others, the Matrix Reloaded shows us a future that takes place in a sweaty, dense urban cavern, where nearly everyone is perfect looking, between the ages of 20 and 35, 90% of whom have their heads shaved or have long dreadlocks, and break into ecstatic, sex-fueled dancing whenever music starts playing.  When some insightful, philosophical-sounding dialogue is needed, and older person is trotted out to recite it.There's also a stale love-triangle plot involving the fearless prophet Morpheus, who's partner left him for an incompetent, pointy-headed bureaucrat who somehow became leader of the ""defense"" of Zion, but who does little else in the movie except whine.The first Matrix film was about waking up to things you didn't know.

I really like the matrix except for the last 2 minutes (it should have ended with the kiss), because of that stupid superman thing.You would think they wouldn't dare to show such cheesybess in the sequel, right??? think again, they'll be showing off neo's superman skills even more :( They also should have scrapped the first 30 minutes of the film (i don't mind the philosophy, but the character introduction and dialog was just way too slow).The action scenes are enjoyable, but slightly too long and way too much ""bullettime"". The usage of bullettime in ""the matrix"" was way more subtle. Most CGI work was very obvious and incosequent (the guy next to me noticed neo's (digital) appearance change from shot to shot), also the blue screen and/or rear-project in the car-chase scene is quite annoying.i think i need to see the movie a few more times before i can comment on the story/plot, but there are definitely a few holes to fill..all in all, an entertaining film (if you can see past all the cheesyness), but no where near the first Matrix film. Lets just hope the next matrix film will be better.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It lacked the innovation and the awe that made the first one so impressionable.  The Zion population was a poor creation.  Everybody is fit and erotic with a gypsy spirit who dance sexually when it's time to celebrate.  It was like one of those young pop diva MTV videos.  In fact, the whole film played out like separate videos with  circuit music rhythm's.  Oh boy, it must be another fight scene coming!  The entrance into Zion was fun along with many of the computer generated images. (reminding me why I'm afraid of computers; how can we believe anything anymore?) The opening dream sequence told me that I was going to have a bad experience with it's jerky opening and sloppy slow motion tactics.  It was too formulaic and lazy.

Then the action starts. However, those who think that 1000 Smith's are fun to watch, well, sure they are, for a while, but it soon gets dull. The scene with the 1000's Smith's are overlong and it feels like watching a PlayStation 2 game since the computer animations are so obviously computer animations. It doesn't feel or look real for a minute, which makes the scene lame.Then we have the so much talked about car-chase. ""It's the best car-chase scene in film history"", I've heard people say. Well, it is not. MAD MAX (1979), MAD MAX 2 (1981) and several other movies had far better car action, with real cars, I might add. The car chase/crash scenes in MATRIX: RELOADED are mostly computer animations mixed with slow going cars, which makes the scene, once again, dull. And overlong.The film itself seems at a first glance, filled with information, but that is an illusion. The film is a boring mix of overlong computer animations and uninteresting live scenes, and some firearms-action scenes.
Where MATRIX was a good film, the sequel is a bad film. Sad, but true. This could have been done so much better, but they choose not to.4 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Matrix should have been left alone after one movie as it appeared it would be at the end of it but I suppose due to the huge popularity of the movie made the 'W' brothers couldn't pass up another payday. Can't say I blame them, I would do the same thing too but I would definitely come up with something better than this inane drivel.The movie is very drawn out, some sequences are so long and uncomfortable feeling that you'll want to scream ""enough already""! There are several scenes that do not even need to be there as they do not move the plot along or effect the story in any way. The whole sequence in Zion for example starting with Morpheus's terribly weak and laughable speech through the love scene and the party. It was a waste of 10-15 minutes this movie could have sorely done without, these guys aren't the philosophers they think they are. There are many good action sequences, especially the freeway chase which was very well done.What really kills this movie though is there's no longer any 'hook', without that the movie loses its mystique and its ability to keep us interested. As in Usual Suspects and the first movie, there was a question that needed to be answered. For Suspects it was ""who is kaizer soze?"" For The Matrix it was ""What is The Matrix?"" This movie has none of that and it's a major oversight that these guys didn't come up with something for us to want to know about. Their attempt with Agent Smith came off comical at best, did they use up all their intelligent stuff in the first movie?I'd give this movie a ""rent it"" recommendation, it might be better in the comfort of your own home on your DVD player so that you can fast forward through the parts that get on your nerves. I know I will rent the final one, for a 'bridge' movie in the trilogy this movie makes for a perilous walk of patience.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But the question is, is it worth all this hype?Well when I saw this film I had very high expectations, hoping that it could compare to the first film. Sadly, my expectations were a bit too high. Not only does this one not even compare to the first one, I wish it wasn't even in the trilogy.. Might as well Reload a new film into it's spot.Well so you know why I feel this, I'll give you some reasons.. First of all the film was just plain boring.. It didn't become interesting until about 20 minutes into the film, with the fight between smith and Neo. This fight was pretty cool, I'll admit that. The fighting was definately better than the first, very very cool.. But, all good things must come to an end, especially since this one fight seemed to last forever..  After seeing Neo beat on about 12 Smith's I couldn't wait for this scene to end because it just got sooo boring..THe entire begining of this film wasn't very interesting. That rave scene lasted way too long and whats the deal with Trinity and Neo being little horny dogs? Got on my nerves a little.. No clue why they had to through in either of those scenes, I guess the rave to try and attract men, by showing some nipples and women by showing Neo getting laid..Since I'm running out of time, the action in this film was pretty cool.. Definately better than the first one, but just the movie was not. This movie wasn't anywhere near as good as it's predecessor. I would give this a 6 out of 10..","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

i really am surprised about the good marks of this movie, but i can only explain that by the enormous environment pressure of that movie, all that advertising... maybe people are afraid to tell their real feelings or even believe they saw a good movie because of that pressure, but if you read other comments, you will see that we, who have the nuts to write it down, we are pretty much all close together.i gave that movie a 4/10 and well that is a maybe a little too hard, it could be a five but not more. i believe that we all want to have our peace of bread watching a movie and if yours is just watching action... here is my go, but i for myself want to be drawn into a movie. a movie is not more than 5/10 if it cannot hold you at least some moments after leaving the cinema. you all will remember the whole matrix discussion we all had in 1999 but reloaded was just forgotten the moment i left the cinema. thats not worse the money you have to spend for our high-tech cinemas and not worse my time, as there are other movies to watch, more than i can.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Matrix Reloaded seemed like it was built from the ground up around the fight sequences, which were well done but just went on too long and seemed to serve little purpose in the plot.  It just seems like almost every other movie stamped out of the Hollywood mold...gratuitous sex(which added nothing to the story), car chases & fight sequences...to cater to the 17-25 year-old demographic.

This sequel is not terrible, but it is definitely weak. The first hour of the movie is simply boring. The kind of boring where you sit in the theater glancing at your watch every 15 minutes and realise you are enduring the movie rather than enjoying it. (I noted three other 'movie goers' walking out of the theater during this time.) When the action does begin, the 'fight' scenes are reminiscent of any 'Kung-Fu' movie you have seen and are often ridiculously long.The ""$300,000,000"" budget was obviously poured into adding as much CG into as many scenes as possible, and although some aspects of the CG were very impressive...most were so exaggerated that people in the theater actually laughed and from then on the movie felt more like a 'comic book' style movie with Neo as the 'Superman' character. There were a few good additions to the background story and workings of the matrix as an entity, but apart from those I though the story was dull without any exciting revelations. The characters were developed even less and there was no feeling of empathy. This wasn't helped by poor dialogue and/or pathetic love scenes between several key characters. All in all, there were actually a couple of scenes and effects that were fantasic, but overall the movie was no where near the quality of the original 'Matrix' and I will not be bothering to see the next movie in the series. 3/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They pulled the impossible, I like to call it the Mortal Kombat Effect. The first was awesome, then it spiraled down in the second.Seems to me like the directors were just trying to fit as much special effects and Neo pulling his Superman act rather than focusing on the real point to the story. They should have actually explained certain things and given the movie an ending, rather than pulling that cliffhanger crap that so many typical science fiction movies tend to do. And what was with the 'celebrating humanity' scene. It's like they just thought, lets see if we can get away with an orgy/sex scene and see what people think.Even the acting was blah. Neo was twice as confused as he was in the original, though then it was understandable, now just irritating. Carrie making herself into just plain old, the action hero, and Morpheus going biblical. Why?The only redeeming factor of this monstrosity of a film is that of the acting and character of Agent Smith. Hugo Weaving is the only reason this film succeeded in my mind. At least they were thinking when they brought him back and with more cynical remarks and cool entrances. Not to mention Hugo is a fine actor indeed. Having seen this and LOTR only further made me believe in his character. Sadly enough, I was rooting that he would kill everyone in the end, that's how bad this movie was.See it to put a weird spin on the Matrix, a classic to this day, but don't see because you want enjoy a movie for the evening or afternoon or morning. It is not a good movie. Actually, I take that back, see it only for Smith, just listen to some music while you watch the okay action sequences and blank acting.5 out of 10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I refused to see it on principle but the advertisements, my friends, and envy dragged me in.  The film was enjoyable because the actions scenes were novel, Keanu Reeves acts on his highest plateau, and there was an understanding of technology which is amiss in most current science fiction films (presently thinking of the Hulk).  My problem and it should be of any aware filmgoer is that we're getting ripped off - and enjoy it.  The fun for me is to see where the filmakers derived each scene of the movie.  It was almost as if the filmakers spent all their time contriving unbelievable action scenes and then cut and pasting a story around it.  The romance of the movie was EXACTLY the same one in the movie TOUCH, a bad comedy, redeemed by Tom Arnold, directed by the Texi Driver Paul Schrader.  I don't want (and can't) reveal the story to you but here are a list of movies that are overtly mentioned in this film: Touch, Hip-Hop music videos and the epic crane shot from Intolerance, Superman, Star Wars (the entire saga but I'm sure we're not going to see ewoks), Vanilla Sky, Toy Story 2 (the old toy repairman), Intolerance, Minority Report, Finding Nemo, and Terminator.  I wish the directors would hand the reins of directorship to someone that can tell a story and focus on what they do best choreograph action scenes.  They are no James Cameron, but only a shade of him.  Kind of like what Megadeth is to Metallica.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was very obvious that someone who had no business being involved with this film exerted way too much influence over this very pathetic excuse for a sequel. 
ZION OR GET IT ON!Zion was a 45 minute series of failed cliches with a 15 minute long subterranean orgy.  Now, don't get me wrong, I love a good butt rubbing temple service as much as the next guy but this scene did not pass the laugh test -- many in my theater were quite amused.  I was totally expecting the animated Soul Train logo to ride across the screen.BULLET TIME AFTER TIME AFTER TIMEEvery action sequence was just a little too long and a little too effects dominated.  The attitude was, ""Well, that shot cost us $1 million so let's leave it in.""  #1 rule in good film making -- less is more.  No question there were some mind blowing sequences -- but why bury them in overdone and unecessary ones?DIGRESSALOGUEThe well crafted exchanges in the first movie degenerated into pseudo philosophical nonsense.  It was repetitive, predictable, shallow, and even absurd at times.  A few intreging concepts were introduced -- but without the sorely needed editing and tightening to the dialogue, they were left undeveloped.HUH?With all of this said, the movie would have still made a decent showing if not for the Zion debacle (including the pesky boy and the wise counselor with no point to make) and other film additions that were outright annoying (ie., the lovesick program and the orgasmic dessert to name a few).Some redeeming story twists in the last 15 minutes saved the film from complete disaster.  Personal appeal to the Wachowski's: Please return to the formula you used for the first one.  Do not compromise or sell out to anyone.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

We loved the first Matrix and looked forward to seeing Reloaded, but the ending was a cheat.   At the ending, someone in the audience said ""What!?"", in surprise that that the whole movie had only been part of a cliffhanger and didn't make a whole lot of sense standing as a single feature. (Understandably, you have to see The Matrix for background to even have a clue of what Reloaded is about.  ...but it seems to have to see the next sequel in this cliffhanger to understand was *this* movie was about. ...there were way too many disjointed statements and loose ends for most audience members to keep up.)Anyway, just to be sure we weren't the only ones feeling angry, I asked another couple walking to the parking lot.  They agreed.  The movie made *them* angry and they agreed it was, on the whole, a cheat.My theory is that the producers are so into cross-marketing the video game and Powerade, etc. that they forgot to give us a good movie.  (Our navy son said he only understood the movie because he had bought the video game. In fact, MUCH of the action in the movie *felt* like a video game - a little over the top to be sci-fi believeable.)Also, though the action scenes were good, most scenes ran way too long. When I began to get *bored* with the highway chase scene, with it's muliple high-impact crashes and 18-wheeler roof fights, I knew the scene has just run too long.  I also got bored with the mulitple agent fight.  ...too long.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It actually had quite a few good components and even improved in some ways from the first film, but overall the plot was extremely boring to sit through and I was just waiting for the movie to end.The cast of characters were mediocre, like the first film; Neo and Trinity continue to have no emotion whatsoever, while Morpheus and Agent Smith continue to be enjoyable. I liked the action more in this film as it was less over-the-top and more grounded, however there were still some scenes which I did not like. The Merv was actually quite good as a villain, but not great, however he was a good addition to the film. It was also nice to see more of the real world in this film, especially more world-building for Zion.The music in this film was slightly better than the first; there was less modern Hans Zimmer-like music and more orchestral themes, and the modern generic soundtrack was also less noticeable. However, the CGI was as bad, or even worse than the first film, which was surprising as this film was made 4 years after the first.Overall, The Matrix Reloaded had a lot of potential with some good components but the plot did not entertain me at all.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The story, as many of you who haven't seen the film yet are half expecting, is nothing like the original mind-freeing concept of matrix 1. The special effects while more advanced technically than the film's predecessor seemed rather lack luster to me.  Reloaded's fight scenes come off as gratuitous and contrived, whereas matrix 1's fight scences and explosions were intricately woven into its mind-blowing plot.  This is a great example of a fantastic movie that wasn't meant for sequels forced into a trilogy that can only make feeble attempts at recreating the success of the one that started it all.

Not identifying with them we therefore don't really care what happens to them.  Not caring for the characters we don't get terribly involved with the story (what little there is).  We are then left with a banal list of scenes where the current vogue (at this writing) of flying bodies clash in the air ad nauseam.  The bodies simply keep coming back for more, unhurt, apparently even after being tossed against brick walls that a crushed by the bodies.*Consider: The stepladder of antagonists, sometimes called the ""chain of promises"" are what keep people turning a page or sitting at the edge of a theater seat.  The way it works best is that the protagonist does not solve the first problem until the second problem is already introduced.  Each problem represents a promise to the viewer that there will be suspense, excitement and adventure in solving the problems.  We raved about The Matrix when it was first released because it had so much visual and structural inventiveness.  Now, the Wachowski Bros. appear to be saying, ""So, you like the incessant karate-chops and flying bodies, here's much more.""  In Matrix II Big-load a giant serving of the flying bodies that is apparently just a half of the plate, we are left quite sated.  Do we care about Matrix Big-Load Part III to come next fall?

The script is poorly written, the dialogues were wooden, long, boring and confusing, and most of all, the action was terrible. There is NO chemistry between Neo and Trinity. The philosophical messages in this one is not bad, but was nothing like the clarity and insight like what the first movie was... whereas in this one I found myself going blablabla at many scenes.

This movie was bad in that special way that the Buffalo Bills are bad at winning Superbowls.  Really bad.
It is not uncommon for a movie to present the viewer with an alternate reality.  That's great; it's part of the fantasy.  However, a reasonable movie will stake out territory and then be consistent within that new reality.  In ""The Matrix Reloaded"", anything can make sense, at any time, and you're just supposed to accept it.  Neo has the ability to stop bullets, but not punches.  He has the ability to ""go superman"" and leave any situation he wants, but he sticks around to fight 50 guys who never get hurt, no matter what he does to them.  If no one gets hurt or stays down, is it really even a fight?  It looked more like dancing to me.
Another theme of the movie was people trying to make sense of their purpose. If you want to watch someone find their special purpose, I suggest Steve Martin's ""The Jerk"".
Apparently, this movie's primary objective is to get you to watch the third one.  Personally, I've got a long list of things that will need to happen before I ever do that.  On my life's big ""to do"" list, watching the third Matrix movie falls somewhere between going to Branson Missouri to see the world's biggest ball of string and learning how to ""swing dance"".","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

All of these are absent from the film. All that remains is an excessive, muddled mess, which neither style, state-of-the art FX nor Keanu's fine performance can redeem. Here we traverse the hackneyed components of the standard action film ... the shoot-out, the fist-fight, the car chase, the encounter with the degenerate power-broker, gratuitous sexuality, the search for the ""maguffin"" (in this case a key), with werewolves and and a oblique reference to the Holy Grail added for good measure?!. All of this is familar territory, which has been done much better in previous films (the car chase in Ronin blows this one away, despite all the special FX).

The first one was a great movie and an original plot.  These days it is rare that anything comes out of Hollywood that's original and worth a damn.  I rarely pay a cinema to see a movie, because most movies are a waste of money. The Matrix was different though and not the usual crap.  I didn't see The Matrix at the theaters and I really wish I had and hope they will re-release it someday in theaters so I can see it on the big screen.My husband and I were both really anticipating Matrix Reloaded and saw it opening night.  We just knew it would be as grand of a movie as the first and we weren't going to miss seeing it at the theater.  We were wrong. Matrix reloaded sucked.  Waste of money, waste of time.  I've read plenty of comments saying that if you didn't like this movie you're an idiot and just didn't understand it.  That's far from the truth.  This was just more Hollywood crap!!!The whole first part (Zion) was stupid and irrelevant.  After that it got a little better, but the fight and chase scenes were so drawn out, you could step out for a whole cigarette and bathroom break and make it back before the end of the scene you left in.  The ending was horrible.  It tried for like a Lord of the Rings ending.  Problem is it's not a good enough movie to pull a stunt like that.  It didn't leave me wanting to even see the third one.  IF I see the third one, it will be when it hits cable.  After seeing The Matrix Reloaded, I wouldn't even waste the money to rent the third one.
Point:  Don't even bother renting this one, EVEN IF YOU LOVED THE MATRIX. Wait until RELOADED comes on cable to view.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But this was to be expected and prepared for.Reloaded, however, isnt really able to stand as a movie in its own right; it feels more like two extra hours off the end of the first movie or an introduction to the third one. While the beginning had the strength of its ideas behind it, Revolutions (the third movie) will have the conclusion of the epic struggle but Reloaded is left with nothing to do but extend the ideas.Thats not to say it isnt good. When Reloaded hits top gear, it is an excellent film as the Wachowskis begin to show what they can do. The Highway chase scene, the Agent Smith battle and others are bound to get the adrenalin pumping. However, a plot advancement from the first film, or a plot at all would have transformed Reloaded from a series of action scenes strung together into a truly great movie.But as it stands, Reloaded doesnt feel complete in any right. Neo has learned all the tricks he needs, he can fly, fight and kick ass but he cant do what he set out to do at the end of the Matrix. ""I'm going to show you a world without them"". But he doesnt, he keeps doing the same thing he's been doing all along. The Zion scenes are interesting, but too long and lacking in real point. In the end, much of the Matrix Reloaded progresses simply so that another action scene can be set up.There are snatches of story. The debates about control throughout the movie are interesting, as is the heroes' encounter with a very learned French program. The plot really ignites in the last part of the movie when the script finally comes to the forefront and shows some ingenuity, providing a spectacular twist that renders prophecy obsolete in the face of mathematical truth. For a movie that is about spirituality and destiny in a world of machines and computers, the overriding of humanity by cold science makes for a powerful moment and a brilliant lead up to the third movie.
Why couldnt all of Reloaded have been like this? The ending is, in a way, the biggest disappointment of all because it shows how great the film might have been. But in the end, Reloaded will probably turn out to be the lesser of the trilogy, linking what I hope will be two great movies of epic proportions.But should you see the Matrix Reloaded? Absolutely. Great action, great moments and a great twist make Reloaded an unmissable experience. Too bad it lacked a great plot, but you cant have everything, right?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

When the first one came out, I didn't think I wanted to see it from the previews. Then after my first viewing, I was blown away. It was the most unique story and mind-boggling action I had seen in years. I watch it frequently, and still love every minute of it...why, because it's so smooth. The story is great, the action unique and fantastic and the acting (minus the Keanu dullness we've come to expect) are exceptional.I have waited patiently for the next installment... and finally it arrives. I'm there opening day. But wait, this is not the same style movie. What happened?Suddenly Neo, who at the end of Matrix 1 can defeat Agents without working up a sweat is back to the basics. In Reloaded, he's having to fight way too long and having little effect. Why? Because Agent Smith is also free? Gee, I thought he was dead? Where is he plugged in?The story is confusing, to say the least. In the first, the Matrix, we thought, had been conquerred by Neo, for he was THE ONE! Trinty showed us that. But here it exists again, and nothing has really changed.The other mortals, in the first Matrix, were easily killed by agents, so easily that their only choice was to RUN! Now, Morpheus and Trinty can hold their own with any of them, even the Albino Drealock Twins.And now we learn, through some overly extended dialog that repeats itself madly, that this is not the first Matrix and Neo is not the first anomoly.It's no wonder we're all confused.Also, just as a mention... the scenes of Zion are corny and stupid. If I were there, I'd be like Joe Patiolano in the first movie and say ""Put me back in!""The problem is this... in order for the Wachowski Brothers to step this up a notch, they had to smack us with all they could in the way of action. So they spent $30 million dollars building a freeway for a unique but long chase scene. Then they hit us with a Agent Smith barrage that took 45 days to shoot. They spent their time and the $127 million dollar budget on creating the next generation of action sequences... but they ran out of money and time to fully develop the script.So we wound up with a long, confusing movie filled with dialog tripe, ghastly views of the paradise of Zion, and incredible, but long action sequences. I give Kudos to the cinematographer for the ingenuity of some of these as they truly break new ground. But action alone can't make a movie.But unless the 3rd installment is written by a master, we're going to hate parts 2 and 3 in the long run. It's going to take a miracle to put this story back on track to complete a great trilogy. My guess is, that it won't happen. We'll get more action, a happy ending, and another billion dollar franchise. But I think we'd all be better off leaving the Matrix 1 as a stand alone feature. I fear, that for the sake of the buck, they've taken a nice piece of work and drawn it out into a long messy trilogy just for the money. I'm hoping that's not the case, that by some miracle the script can pull this all back together, but I fear that just can't happen. Being a free lance writer, I can't even begin to think of how to patch this mess up.I did enjoy Reloaded, but only for the 2+ hour escape. It was eye candy, but too long in too many places. And the story just doesn't work. The plot has as many holes as Neo stopped bullets. And no amount of patching can make this one hold water again. But one can always hope...and as a final solution, put the original back in the DVD player.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Shames the original","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0705083/?ref_=tt_urv","tripwires","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0976110/?ref_=tt_urv","6 July 2003","""The Matrix"" was a brilliant film that was almost prophetic of the future in its message to viewers around the world. I could draw parallels between it and Aldous Huxley's dystopian novel set in the near future, ""Brave New World."" In my book, a film that can be compared to a novel, a great novel, is a film worth watching. ""The Matrix"", the original, was such a film.Unfortunately, ""Reloaded"" isn't. Not even close. First of all, I don't see any elements in the first movie that actually garners it a sequel, one that isn't only unnecessary but also undermines the impact of the first movie. Second of all, ""Reloaded"" was - gasp - painfully and utterly boring. I slept through the first half of the movie and was only kept awake during the second half because I decided to keep myself awake by chewing on a Mentos.
""Reloaded"" was pointless and pretentious in its futile efforts to pass off as an intellectual action movie. Somebody should've told the film-makers that such a formula hardly ever works, and when it does the first time round, they should be counting their blessings and be happy with the state of pinkish health their bank accounts are in. While its predecessor managed to mix quality action sequences with thought-provoking philosophical truths, ""Reloaded"" fell flat in that aspect. Its action scenes, for one, were too incredible, the special effects so overdone that they appeared fake. And the philosophy part? It was a noble attempt on the film-makers' part, I will admit, but unfortunately, whatever they were trying to convey got horribly lost in the mess of flying bodies and constant sprays of bullets that nobody could actually get what they were trying to put across in the end. One scene featuring some holy person spewing some philosophical gibberish that lasted for about fifteen minutes out of the two-hours-and-something-minutes of the film cannot possibly be powerful enough. After two hours' worth of an assault of the sense of sight which was also practically a lullaby for the brains, one simply cannot really bother to figure out what that man in the TV room was saying to Neo. Personally, I didn't even care.The plot was also a problem. The love angle between Trinity and Neo was redundant and boring, and the lack of chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Fisher didn't help matters much either. It was too overplayed and the time they spent kissing on screen could've been saved for bored members of the audience like me to do more productive things. The mass orgy/whatever scene at Zion was, too, an incredible waste of celluloid and screen time. It served no other purpose, it seemed, other than to please stereotypical male members of the audience. And the rest of the plot... wait, plot? What plot? I highly doubt a plot existed in the first place.In addition, Keanu Reeves becoming Superman only made me laugh out loud and his usual bland as plain water acting only added to the hilarity of it all. Reeves is a bad actor through and through, but he somehow managed to overcome that intriguing handicap in the first movie. Here, the lack of character development and his lack of anything else to do but fire guns, save Trinity from the evil clutches of the awesome Agent Smith, and fly like Superman, only made clearer his immense disability to say a few simple lines with that tricky thing called emotions. He expressed his love for Trinity, and I thought he was ordering a pizza or asking directions to the toilet. Reeves would be much better off without seemingly complex emotional scenes for him to handle, scenes that would other be handled with ease by a better, more profound actor.The rest of the main cast, fortunately, were okay, although they seemed to have got slightly more pretentious and annoying. Still, Agent Smith was the highlight of the movie (although that scene with hundreds of him was a huge joke to me), and the direct element that made me stay on and not walk out after I fell asleep for the 20th time. There is just something so compelling about the way Hugo Weaving snarls at Neo and morphs into people that it makes you rather excited to see the kind of havoc he'd be up to next. If there were to be a movie with Agent Smith as its protagonist, I'd definitely pay to see it. Keep Keanu Reeves out though. And while we're at that, keep the overall senselessness of ""Reloaded"" out, too. A sorely disappointing sequel, even worse than what I'd originally expected. A shame to the first movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Thankfully, I wasn't disappointed. I really enjoyed this movie but there are a few things that didn't need to be in the movie. In my opinion the movie could have entirely done without the dance and sex scenes. Neither of them really contribute to the story and take up much time that the movie is lacking later on. The dance scene is completely useless and didn't catch my eye at all. I think it took up to much time but I will get to that later on. The sex scene I can understand a bit more because it shows the love between Neo and Trinity which plays a part in the movie later on. But like the dance scene, it did absolutely nothing to the plot of the movie. A major reason I liked the first Matrix so much is because of the story. It was so interesting to me and I hope Reloaded might top the first. Unfortunately, Reloaded did not top ""The Matrix"" simply because the story is very choppy near the end. The point I was getting at before is those two scenes dramatically took up movie time and the climax of the movie was shortened because of it. The scene in the movie where they have to blow up the power plant and Neo has to go to the core of the Matrix is extremely choppy. I think that was the high point of the story and it disappointed me simply because previous scenes shortened the time it had in the movie. Well, not every movie can be perfect but Reloaded nonetheless is very good.Now for the action in the movie. MIND-BOGGLING!!! That's all I can say. The fight scenes and car chase are simply top notch. What I loved about these scenes are their length. Short action sequences leave me feeling empty. I liked the twins but they really didn't have much of a part in the movie. If their part could have increased in the movie that would have been great. Overall I give this movie an 8/10. It would have gotten a 10/10 if it weren't for silly scenes that shortened the plot of the movie. I really enjoyed this movie and I hope you do as well.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","decent sequel","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0705107/?ref_=tt_urv","Buddy-51","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0375636/?ref_=tt_urv","7 July 2003","By combining groundbreaking special effects with a heavy dose of religious symbolism and allegory, the original `Matrix' (1999) quickly became a cult classic, generating a legion of fanatical followers almost immediately upon its release (films often have to wait many years to attain a cult following, but `The Matrix' did not).   More than just a movie to many of its fans, `The Matrix' has become something of a religious icon, an object to be studied over, memorized and worshipped by the faithful as if its text were some sort of pop culture, New Age scripture and its creators the enlightened gurus of our technological time.In `The Matrix Reloaded,' Keanu Reeves returns as Neo, the Messiah/Christ figure set apart to help overthrow the massive computer program that has taken over the world.  The many allusions to the Bible and Greek mythology - particularly in the names assigned to various characters and places in the film - are really only window dressing for all the eye-popping CGI effects that are the true justification for the film's existence.  And, indeed, the special effects are mighty impressive, a quantum leap over those in the original film, but all this technical wizardry does come with a bit of a price.  Some of the action scenes are so over-the-top in fashion and style that they actually end up draining the film of much of its inherent suspense.  When characters can do ANYTHING and get away with it - defying all laws of physics and gravity in the process - then they lose that quality of vulnerability that makes the audience care.  We watch these sequences, dazzled by their brilliance, yet we do so as detached outsiders and not the insiders we would be if the characters' lives seemed more threatened. Perhaps a few more ground rules - i.e. who can be hurt and how - would be in order to take care of this problem.Despite that flaw, and despite the fact that the sequel lacks the sense of unraveling mystery we found in the original, the Wachowski Brothers deserve credit for churning out an enjoyable big budget action film that at least tries to create an interesting world and doesn't just settle for tired old stereotypes and clichés.  Special praise must go to the art directors who have done a spectacular job visualizing the city of Zion, home base to the resistance forces who are hell bent on defeating the evil machines that have reduced humanity to a perpetual dream state located inside a computer mainframe.  We will even forgive the filmmakers for turning Zion - however briefly - into a giant milling mosh pit early on in the film.  The idea of machines taking over and crushing our humanity has been a staple of science fiction ever since the dawn of the industrial age.  Still, `The Matrix' movies have found a clever way to tap into our specific paranoia related to the cyber world in which we find ourselves living.Although `The Matrix Unloaded' is an entertaining film in its own right, anyone unfamiliar with the original will most likely be totally confused by the action on the screen, since very little attempt is made to explain the intricacies of the plot to the uninitiated.  As a result, anyone who dares venture forth to see this second installment without intimate knowledge of the first had best beware.To be continued.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

You wouldn't be at this site researching if you didn't want to double check others opinions.  So fellow imdb user, you want to hear hype.  Sorry you will get none for matrix 2.Think of it this way.  135 minutes of running time.  The first 75 minutes is dialogue and a little bit of action.  The next 60 minutes is super duper action.  Watching it in the 3rd row of a packed theatre in Chicago, it was almost too much.  Gaeta keeps the camera spinning around the characters, that you think you are in an ""ER"" episode gone awry.  Constant circling of Neo fighting 100 Agent Smith's in the Burly Brawl.I wanted some closure with the fight scenes.  It was this constant hit, hit, hit, deflect, deflect, deflect...and both combatants are still standing because each is impervious.What gave Matrix 1 the edge is that Neo kept evolving with his powers. Like when he fought Smith the first time and broke his glasses.  Or of course the final scene when he could ""see"" the Matrix and destroyed Smith.  How come the story didn't develop that aspect?  It would have been more intriguing in this reviewer's opinion that if he were able to reach the ""Architect"" he could then master a new move or see the Matrix in a new way...since this is just an overblown video game.In regards to the dialogue, it reminds me of a scene from ""Amadeus"" where when the court conductor explains to Mozart that his opera contains ""too many notes"".  Mozart was dumbfounded.  This movie has ""too many words"". A perfect example that the Wajchowski's were given absolute license without anyone ""destroying their vision"".  Don't worry Larry and Andy...you'll understand your blunder of not using an editor once the word of mouth gets out about this train wreck.Save your money.  Wait for DVD.

And let me repeat that - Entertaining. This film succeeds where all super hero (comic) films fail.  That is, in order to successfully portray characters with the likes of Neo, Morpheus and Trinity, the film should be tackilly ""Surreal.""Though this concept doesn't originate in comic books, any film wishing to portray comic characters, video game characters, etc., should follow suit. For example, doing so would have enabled director Bryan Singer (X2) to show X-Men in their original comic book attire without looking like ""Power Rangers"" --  Show them in a real world, and you get ""real reactions."" Surreal characters belong in a surreal world, romanticized to the max. Bullet-time, Ultra Slo Mo, all help transcend each character's propensity to look very stupid. It even worked for Charlie's Angels.  If you go to this movie with expectations of plausability and deep dialog, you will be let down. Sorry. Tacky lines and shallow characters are par for the course.YES, go see it for the action scenes and the special effects. I promise, you will not regret your experience.

Absolutely it does- and rightfully so because no one does this better than Andy and Larry.

A film set in the future where we're all slaves of some kind? Haven't heard of that one before. Plus, in Neo, Morpheus (silly name) and Trinity we had the three most dull characters in the history of cinema. Trinity's obsessive affections for Neo would have been mildly convincing were it not for the fact that Neo, the saviour of the universe, is played by... Keanu Reeves, surely the most baffling phenomenon to strike Hollywood: he's only good at playing morons (Bill and ted, Point Break) and his only talent is being able to make the terrifying notion of a bomb on a bus sound as dull as watching Songs of Praise on a sunday evening. Still, the action was fun, so it weren't all bad.The Matrix Reloaded is all bad. For a start, it's preposterously straight faced, full of dull portent and cod-philosophy that becomes exceptionally wearing over two or so hours. The total dearth of characterisation is even more obvious second time around: it's this flaw that completely spoils the action, which was the only thing I was even expecting to be good. Sure, it's spectacular, but it's not exciting, or tense, because you know nothing about these half-dimensional characters to feel any suspense for them. Plus, the fact that neo is virtually invincible means that there's no real contest as to who's going to win. there's a fight about every ten minutes, and each fight goes on forever, and not one gets you on the edge of your seat. Sure, it's technically impressive, but there's no soul underneath. It's all a load of self-consciously cool posturing, cheesy in-jokes and lame dialogue.I really felt bad for seeing this: deep down i knew it was going to pretty poor, but I didn't expect the action to be rubbish as well. It is without a doubt one of the most dull blockbusters ever made: however, it doesn't even have the perverse 'Oh my god I'm watching a once decent saga disintegrate before my very eyes' fascination that the appalling Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones had to offer. No, The Matrix wasn't that great to begin with, and this is worse. Yet, this film is going to be blatantly bigger than God: such a shame. It's easily one of the most pretentious films I've seen in ages, and it's fooling a lot of people into thinking it's something deeply meaningful with the irony-free platitudes spouted interminably by it's blank protagonists (two worst scenes: Morpheus' speech at Zion, and the pointlessly verbose encounter with between Neo and a surprise character at the end), and the fact that everyone wears black and no one smiles at all only adds to the irritating self-importance of it all. No wait, Agent Smith smiles a few times: ironically, he's by far and away the most human character in the film, he was certainly the best thing in the first film, but they really overegged the whole 'Hello, Mr. Anderson' routine this time around. Everyone else acts like they are robots.It so badly wants to be cool, yet this utterly soulless experience uses a mask of pretension to hide the fact that this is pure trash. And not the kind of trash that's cool. The kind of trash that is quite simply, TRASH.Really, really poor. And it has what is quite possibly the most unexciting, uninteresting cliffhanger of all time.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It suffers from the same weaknesses as most sequels. The first installment has raised the bar in both critics' and peoples' expectations, but then the old dilemma pops up... nothing can be new a second time. So what does one do as a movie producer? You pour more money in and beef up the special FX budget. That's just what they did with this one and in this respect and ONLY in this respect the outcome is indeed remarkable.Unfortunately there is barely any coherent story-telling to speak of. Especially the architect scene close to the end is a near declaration of bankruptcy as far as the authors' ability or willingness to focus on engaging story-telling by visual means is concerned. Much of the time wasted earlier on the latest and coolest visual effects should have been invested here. As the time budget was obviously running short, we're confronted with a mostly verbal and rather rushed illustration of the very key elements of the overall story.To summarize, The Matrix Reloaded is a must-see for fans of the franchise and for everyone who loved the first part and wants to know how the story continues. Also, fans of movies that are heavy on the special FX side should not miss it. Everyone else may safely pass.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I must say that this film was all I was hoping it would be, while at the same time being completely different than I expected.  Some here have commented on a lack of plot, but I think that that it only suffered from the inherent issues of a ""middle movie"" Empire Strikes Back didn't have a ""satisfying ending,"" nor did the last movie I saw (The Two Towers--No, I haven't seen another movie in all that time...  I'm a geek, and a cheap one).  Even Back to the Future II was a clifhanger (while not what you'd call ""good"").Reloaded IS an orgy of Kung-Fu'ery and eye candy CGI effects.  While not the groundbreaker in effects of it's predecesor (""bullet time"" has become a cultural icon...  how could it live up to that), it DOES deliver the amazing shots.  My personal favorite was trinity's jump from the Ducati and her 80 story plummit at the beginning/end of the film.  In fact, this movie was beautifully bookended with a rubber-clad vixen and 1 gigatons of BOOM!In the philosophy department, this film was even more intense than it's daddy.  While The Matrix was in some ways a story already told (The Messiah, the Buddhist concept of reality, the play on Alice in Wonderland), Reloaded gave the series a voice all it's own.  The concept of Fate was a minor theme in the first film, but was pushed MAJORLY to the forefront here.  We are assaulted with the question of what IS free will...  REALLY?  We also are toyed with on the nature of conciousness and soul, (Smith's ""possiession"" and ""freedom""), and I found the philosophical implications of the encounter with the Architect something that will last.  I'll definitly see this movie again before deciding what it's message really is, and I wait with bated breath for it's fullfillment in REVOLUTIONS.For a ""middle movie"", I'd say: As good as ""Empire,"" not as good as ""The Two Towers,"" WAAAAAAAYYYYY better than ""Attack of the Clones"" (and ""Back to the Future II"", of course).  :)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Some of the over-long' scenes were some of the best ones, i.e.; Neo fighting the Smiths, the freeway scene and especially the opening scene with Trinity. The choreography in those scenes was fantastic. We all saw the first one and maybe got a little desensitized to the special effects so, you throw in a little more story and some scenes of sensuality (which always makes most people a little uncomfortable anyway) and people complain... whatever! I, for one, thought the movie was great and well worth seeing. I even loved the rock video, shake the cave scene. What can I say, I'm part of the MTVgen... If I were to rate this with stars: I'd give a healthy 8.5 out of 10. Yeah, it was good.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The only other movie I saw this summer was Tomb Raider 2.  That film had beautiful scenery and Ms. Jolie.  What did Matrix Reloaded have?  Boring fight scenes that went on and on with the same Mr. Smith.  Dumb dialogue that droned on and on.  I think the core audience for this franchise has lost a large segment of viewers with this boring sequel and a whole lot work (editing, re-shooting and marketing) needs to be done for Part 3.  I expect a 50 percent drop in business.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Not much new, I'm afraid...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704553/?ref_=tt_urv","Nick-290","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0426556/?ref_=tt_urv","31 May 2003","All together clearly disappointing. Maybe I expected too much, but while the first movie was original and advanced the genre of action or SciFi movies, this sequel is just a repetition of the same themes with an overdose of special effects.Do we need this sequel? No we don't. Who felt in wont of more information after part one? Let us be frank. Who gives anything about Zion? Who cares if mankind or the machines will win? In a virtual world with virtual heroes and virtual reality, the story line becomes almost irrelevant. Therefore most people watch the sequel because of the special effects, the action, the fighting, the outfit etc. However, I found myself looking at my watch in the middle of the car chase, and after the first twenty seconds of Neo fighting Mr Smith times hundred, I got bored. There is just not much new. Neo flies like Superman (which he did already at the end of part one), he stops bullets in slow motion (which he did already...) and he shows again a lot of martial arts. Yes, this is all better done than before, but the whole point of Matrix is THE IDEA. And here the movie fails to deliver anything new.Even the so called cliff hanger ending does not leave me in eager anticipation of part three. If I happen to go to the cinema at the time of its release and nothing better is on, I might even spend the money to see it. If not, I will wait for the DVD.Bottom line: If you are a Matrix freak, nothing in the world will stop you to blow your money anyway. If you are already sceptical in the first place, do not bother with this sequel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Fast but still second-rate martial arts scenes, 1 surprisingly mediocre car chase scene, lots of 'nice' and not-so-'nice' special effects are the least of this films problems (but flaws nonetheless). Intolerable dialogue, and acting, and a pathetic excuse of a story is mashed convolutely in between seemingly exciting action scenes and scenes of boring 'nothingness' really, with all the uninteresting chitter-chatter you can handle, and then some.The Wachowski's have done two things with this film- one surprising, one not so. Firstly, they've managed to make me hate, no despise, the first film (note to self:go see 1997's Dark City instead) which even in the most incompetent hands I didn't think anyone could do, but Kudos to you Wachowskis, Kudos to you. The less surprising thing they've managed to accomplish is having millions of die-hard fans convinced what they just payed for, and spent nearly 3 hours in the cinema for, was not only worth it, but was the greatest movie event of their lives. (A similar thing happened with LOTR, but any disdain I felt for either LOTR movies have been completely wiped away and replaced with this excuse for entertainment). People who call this the greatest WOULD piss me off more if I didn't know that (most) people like that, shallow as they are, change their opinion every few weeks or months, according to what's hot.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie was very enjoyable and I look forward to its conclusion in November.I have heard people talk and have seen posts of people denouncing The Matrix Reloaded as tired, empty, and an overall bad experience.  I don't believe these people fully understand the filmmakers intentions when watching this movie.  People like to pick apart each detail and criticize everything they see and that's ok.  Personally, I enjoy the experience of watching a movie to get lost in the action, emotion, and adventure and I don't seem to care about how perfect the CGI is or where the minor holes are in the story.

"","","I am happy the Wachowski brothers think enough of us to challenge our Philosophy 101 memories.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704607/?ref_=tt_urv","JohnDeSando","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1391596/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2003","When the action gets tough, the $400 shades adorn the heroes of `Matrix Reloaded.' It may be the Wachowski brothers (directors) telling us that everyone is in the dark about the true meaning of this second installment of the Matrix trilogy. I guess we can all agree that philosophical debates abound about choice and causality, the redemptive power of love, and traditional machines versus computer technology.  Not much time is given to any of those topics in order to jam in as many martial arts scenes and wild chases as possible.I appreciate the care the film takes entertaining us while stretching our cultural awareness with its many allusions, but I just don't get it all, and it frustrates me because I don't think depth of ideas is strength here. Hero Neo (Keanu Reeves) sometimes is Christ, meant to save the human survivors in the core of the earth; other times he is Superman (Is there something about `Reeve' that inspires actors with the same name to play that part?) saving his own hide from the multiplying Agent Smiths (Hugo Weaving). Although the Heidegger, Bible, Buddha, Hesse ideas are annoying when intoned by the likes of pompous Larry Fishburne as Morpheus, I am yet happy the brothers think enough of us to challenge our Philosophy 101 memories.I can better appreciate the mythological attributions of Morpheus, Persephone, Oracle, Trinity, and Niobe. Yet in the end, I just want a good story to supersede these pretenses, and `Matrix Reloaded' doesn't seem to take me beyond the first story because I still know Neo will have a tough time saving the world.However, I also appreciate the great set pieces, for example when Neo fights the multiplying Smiths with the clear influence of `Crouching Tiger's' action director Yuen Wo Ping. It looks as if Reeves does some of the stunts-I tip my hat for once to a not particularly gifted actor. His trip to the Engineering Room is a nostalgic trip to the underworld of `Metropolis,' as giant pistons show machines' amazing strength and vulnerability. The fourteen-minute car/motorcycle/truck chase may be the most interesting segment of the whole film.The film ends with the note `To Be Concluded' (in November) and a hint that Matrix's `Architect' (Helmut Bakaltis) will return to face off with Neo, whose thoughts he claims to revise. I look forward to piecing this all together at that time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first movie had so much more style, it pushed the limits of special effects, had good dialogue, storyline and lots of philosophy.This disgusting sequence of images, aka matrix:reloaded, failed to even live up to the standards set by the first. First of all it looks like they're getting lazy with their special effects. At any time during the big fight scene with agents smith if neo's feet left the ground he would lose all detail and looked so obviously CG. The fight scene itself was so uneventful and long I just about fell asleep.The plot was just a muddled attempt at introducing fifty new characters at once and completely lost its wit, its philosophy and any sense. The entire movie was just the introduction of characters interspersed with poorly made fight scenes and a few scenes with no other point than to add sex appeal to the movie (i.e. the rave scene and the cake scene).I hope both wachowski brothers were either intentionally making this film badly so they could concentrate on revolutions, or that there finger nails and toe nails are ripped out by angry fans of the original.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Do not try to believe the whole thing, if you try, you will be disappointed with some junctures of the storyline. This movie is a visual effects action feast. At the end of some action scenes, I (and most of the audience) just couldnt help letting out expletives to ensure the 'wow'ness of the effects.'Matrix' introduced a new genre of sci-fi action that left most viewers stunned. Unbelievable superhuman stunts were made believable on screen by the way of their execution. ""Reloaded"" has MORE of that. But the impact of the newness is not as profound as in 'Matrix'. Though the stuff that Neo/Zionians do is expected, the scenes are excellently executed and choreographed. There's no point saying lots about the visual effects, you just have to see it, they are (expletive)-ing SPECTACULAR.Though the effort of Wachowski brothers in turning the matrix storyline into epic proportions is laudable, it doesnt achieve the desired effect. 'Matrix' had a much stronger storyline, both from a philosophical and sci-fi point of view. 'Reloaded' exudes efforts to turn that stronger storyline into an 'epic'al nature by creating a stronghold of revolutionists, Zion, and a stronger enemy, the machines. Its more like 2 clans (sci-fi), one good, and one evil fighting for the right, aka 'star wars', 'blade', 'terminator', etc. In short, the storyline for 'Reloaded' doesnt make you think like 'Matrix' deal, its the same old deal of good vs. evil.I havent heard the soundtrack, but the background score isn't anything new either. The symphonies are inserted into the right places to give the movie the 'epic/saga' nature. The 'Matrix' was totally different from what I had seen earlier. 'Reloaded', though has more in the visual effects department, does not have anything new in the other aspects of a movie.All that said, this movie is visually something unprecendented. Action movie fans will just love it, Keanu performs well, his 'pair effect' with CarrieAnn is pretty charming. Fans from other genre's might like this movie less than they would've liked the Matrix. But it is well worth watching just for the visual effects.8.5 out of 10 (101 out of 10 in visual effects)p.s. watch out for the 'keymaker's chamber, would love to design a database for him :)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Take for instances, the sudden multiplying Agent Smith and the rest of the cast. Niobe, Ghost, Persephone, The Twins, Merovingian, Seraph, Lock, Bane, Binary, Vector, Ice....wow...lots more. It's like the world of Matrix has become Multrix! But the good thing is, the introduction to the actual world of Matrix and Zion is truly shocking. The last chapter only focuses on the Ned (Morpheus's ship) and Matrix which is just enough to bring to the second episode.Racing agaisnt time, Neo must find out the main frame and complete the prophecy (huh?). So what did Neo did for the last sixth months (as mention in the movie)? Instead, he was having dream or so call premonition that Trinity's destiny gonna end. All this thing is troubling. But everything doesn't make sense. So Neo has to brace himself and all the crew to jack in and wait (not seek) for the Oracle to come up and spill the bean! So the entire story is about digging for information, learning more question than answer.But of all the suprises of the twisting story, there's the ass-kicking scene which is truly (I mean what did Neo do for that last sixth months? Improving himself of course) jaw dropping and leave you wanting for more after the movie end. The very very exciting highway chasing scene is truly something very old but unique in it way of showing it. I heard they say, The Matrix: Reloaded high-way chasing scene makes Fast and Furious look like Slow and Unserious. I got to admit it! But you have to see it for yourself.So, with talents like the Wachowski brother, I'll do anything just to watch his movies. The Matrix: Reloaded leaves you work you brain and think about everything about your life. The titles is something truly reveal the whole story. Ultimately, run to your nearest cinema and get a DVD copy when it's out. BTW check out the Enter The Matrix if you don't want to lose out any information about the movie. You'll be suprise to see what's with Trinity and Ghost!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first 90 minutes are dull as dirt, including a couple of uninspired fight scenes and endless sequences of pretentious pontificating.  The filmmakers seemed to have lost sight of the fact that the most interesting and fun parts of the first movie take place inside the Matrix with fake people, not in the ""real world"" with the real ones.  I actually got bored as hell, something I never would have dreamed would be my reaction to this long-awaited sequel.The action picks up a little in the 20 minute car chase, although it's not as dramatic or visually exciting as I had heard.  It suffered from the same problem almost all the action sequences in Reloaded did - they were too slow-motion, too impressed with themselves, too video game like.  You just never really get into it.The final 18 or so minutes of the film are really the only ones worth watching.  The plot finally gets moving and I got interested, the action finally got a little tense, and most importantly you start to feel a little humanity and warmth in the characters. This is something almost entirely missing from the rest of the film, where they glide along reciting robot-like dialogue that painfully reminded me of the most recent Star Wars film.  I hope Revolutions is better, but after this the signs are ominous.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Misunderstood, Overcriticized and not the mindless action movie many wanted..","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0705396/?ref_=tt_urv","Totalbiscuit","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2629263/?ref_=tt_urv","21 November 2003","Well I think everyone saw this coming. That is.. the wave of criticism and the fierce arguments which have followed. You create a film as revolutionary as The Matrix and then decide to make it a trilogy.. it's inevitable that people will then say 'It's nothing compared to the first one!' and make various other arguments against the following films. It's happened before.. it'll no doubt happen again in the future. But let's look past this blindness for a moment and actually take a look at the film. Not much point explaining the plot, others have done that in great deal, I'd just like to make a few comparisons.. and then take the movie as a whole.
1) Matrix vs Reloaded - ActionThe Matrix had some of the most stunning action scenes we've seen to date in any movie.. but what people seem to have missed is the fact that Reloaded does too. Neo vs Agent Smith was an excellent scene in the first film.. Neo vs 50 Agent Smiths is just something else... You won't find this sort of thing in any other film.. certainly not that I know of. Reloaded does a great job of taking the kung-fu fight scenes of the first film to a whole new level. Bullet time is fortunately not over-used and tactically placed to give that 'Woah.....' feel whenever it does rear it's little head. Reloaded also sees Neo doing away with firearms and using a variety of different close combat weapons, which is great to see, since The Matrix films does this with such style and finesse. I'd argue that every combat scene just has that extra bit of gloss and polish over the original film and it's all done on a bigger scale. People need to realise that where the first film was focussed on the fortunes of a few.. Reloaded gives a much grander perspective to the conflict and is perhaps, a little more difficult to follow as a result.2) Matrix vs Reloaded - PlotReloaded is simply a deeper film in plot terms.. hands down. There really is absolutely no argument against this. The Matrix's plot was not quite as original as many make out it out to be. It was just another cyber-punk style sci-fi thriller with machines taking over the world and enslaving man-kind. Reloaded expands on this and adds a whole new philosophical (some would argue pretentious) level to the series. It introduces the idea of programs with unique personalities and agendas.. an overall Architect of the Matrix (who I must say acts the part incredibly well) and drops a few bombshells along the way. It requires a bit of thought.. and you really need to watch it a few times to truly appreciate it's virtues.Does that make it better than The Matrix? No.. probably not. The Matrix was a whole different animal.. something we had never seen before. You can't really improve on that, or the feeling you get from watching it. I think the writers realized this and instead of trying to beat it... changed it's nature instead. Many people didn't like that change.. understandable to a certain degree. But I urge you to see this film with an open mind. In my opinion it's far superior to the third film but doesn't quite capture the essense of the first.

The Matrix Reloaded, however, is not.Yes, this movie has those slow-motion special effects and some of the fights are quite a sight, but there are times when I am sitting through this, as well as the long periods of explanations and crappy dialogue, and my train of thought would somewhere within the lines of ""Huh?!"" or ""Could you get it over with?"" or my personal favorite ""Boy, they could have cut lots of this off.""The story could have been a good book at least. The idea is good, but the execution is lousy.

Of course we cannot expect the same innovation and success for the sequel, because you cannot re-invent the Matrix.However everybody expected a good sequel, at least.The Matrix Reloaded looks a less-than-average movie, nevertheless with lots of cool action and special effects. However special effect and cool actions are not enough. If these things are not supported by a proper story, and they are not played professionally, everything just looks stupid.And this is the general feeling you have if you see this movie.Especially annoying are the dialogues, vague and confuse, like they were written down in one week or so for a TV serial.Actors play visibly unconvinced, and during all the movie, I was wondering if -since the actors are evidently the same- behind the cameras there was the same team who made the first The Matrix.Did the Wachowski brother really directed this movie ? The dialogues, the timing, the contents of this movie are so different in style and feeling that I suspect that they participated only marginally to it. Just to put their names, you know ...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's one of the better sequels I've seen in my movie-loving life. But it wasn't great. A half an hour of talking is fine in a comedy, drama, or sometimes even in a musical. But not in an overtly action-based film. No matter how hard you try to explain it otherwise, this is not a drama.The twins could have been used considerably more. Only one scene? (The restaurant scene doesn't count because they didn't do anything.) However, I have a strong feeling that they will be back in November. The car chase was incredible. Fighting the Oracle's bodyguard was great. I loved the Keymaker. But where's the story? Sure, there's a lot of talk, especially with the Oracle and the Architect, about the background of the Matrix (or Matrices?), but no story. Basically this is a 10 minute story turned into a two hour many-million dollar production. Little more than a blatant excuse to use bullet-time. But where are the new executions of bullet-time that John Gaeta talks about in the making of the original? Very disappointing. Nothing new and novel like the first one. Let's hope this is all part of the Wachowskis' plan to blow us away in the third and likely final episode.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is only the first half of a larger movie. From this perspective it resembles The Lord of the Rings. Furthermore, I believe that Matrix Reloaded has exagerate scenes.

In another words, this film needed to at least give a solid story as part as a whole than to cut it off at the end with out much explanation about what is happening right in front of you. A good example of a solid middle entry in a trilogy is The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. It not only expanded what was set forth with the first entry but also gave a solid story with an ending that raises the issues of what will come in the next chapter.

It strove to be more than just an action film, and succeeded with flying colors. I cannot begin to comprehend how people can review this film as less than revolutionary in its marriage of philosophy and martial arts. The philosophy of it is mind-blowing, and is deep enough to suffice the film on its own, but also supports incredible visual ornamentation. Aside from the grand-scale fight scenes the film is rife with tiny moments of great action concepts, that is to say, just the quarter-second-long manner in which a character flips to his feet is the sort of thing that makes you smile. Ignore the nay-sayers. This is an incredible film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's not too common that a sequel meets, let alone surpasses, the quality level of it's predesessor. The directors of this trilogy of films are very talented in the area of suprise and very good at making films that people don't want to get up in the middle of, because they're afraid they might miss what happens next.

This was a big risk, but it paid off thanks in part to great special effects.If you can get past the first 30 minutes or so (which aren't too bad) you're in for great viewing.The story is simple enough if you pay attention. The action sequences are great and the film unfolds at a fast pace so it doesn't drag on. There is also some humour that doesn't spoil the flow.One other thing... I also find the story of The Matrix running along the same lines as the Star Wars trilogy (The Force, The Matrix, The Jedi, The One, The Dark Side, The Machines).

I'm the kind of person who could watch the same film all day, and yesterday I watched Matrix : Reloaded for the 4th time, and I have to say I actually enjoyed it. When I first saw this I thought 'What the hell is going on here?' but I understand now! People who didn't like the rave scene - come on! Imagine if it was the last day of your life, what are you going to do? Enjoy it of course in a human manner, and do lots of human things, or just sit there waiting for your death. So I kind of understand it now...
But there was a few things I didn't like; Well for starters Tank wasn't there, he was so great! And I prefer him to Link. Another thing I didn't like was that Morpheous was the leader, and in Matrix he was the one we had to save no matter what! But in Reloaded Neo was the leader and when Morpheous was in trouble no one cared! I missed the fact that Neo didn't have any questions, because in the first one it was so effective. I have to admit the Zion scene was a little bit to long, but other than that it was cool. And what about the Agents? I swear they said, 'When you see a agent - RUN, run your ass off' Well in Reloaded when a agent came near, I didn't see anyone run their ass off! And I miss the fighting sequence you know, like when they punched Neo 100 times {really fast} Another thing is that Matrix was SO true to life, if anyone watched that 7 out of 10 people would believe that. But with Reloaded I didn't think was that true to life, {shame really}. However those points were little things, and I'm not saying I didn't enjoy it, because I did!Let's just hope that the 3rd installment is great! And I hope that Neo kicks ass, {yea, gorgeous Neo!} and lets hope he can save the world, that is if the prophecy is real, and for one let the questions be answered. In Reloaded there was a cliff hanger ending, oohh I wonder what happens next? o_O

The original was a breath of fresh air - one which got us all talking. How do we know we're *not* in a Matrix? Thought provoking and refreshingly new, it was a big hit even if it did contain some cliches too. The sequel, Reloaded, therefore has a slight problem beause everything that was fresh before, isn't now. So what did they do to combat this? Everything as before but *bigger*, more polished and just 'more'. Plus there is a massive lean towards action as opposed to plot.As for opinion, well it's a bit divided. Personally I think they got aspects spot on, but others were just a waste of time. There was an unecessary character, a scene which is frankly filler, overdone CGI which detracts from the realism, cheesy dialogue, confusing dialogue, too many identical fighting scenes, and an unexplained beginning.But the irony is I enjoyed the movie for its flaws, and recommend it as it *is* so dramatic and polished and exciting.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Some of the core features and functions in this anamorphic object exists for a variety of types. But then it will also have different features and functions at higher levels among those types.  For instance, take the type male and the type female.  They both have some similarites (arms,legs, intestines) and differences (private parts, differing larynx).  They both share the base type ""human"".  Their differences are built upon the type human which creates the new type or object ""Male"" and ""Female"".  An anamorphic type human can thus assume either male or female, the code can change based on the desired type. But the direction goes both ways.  The type human is also built up from a core object (in this case the object ""Animal"").  This all explains Neo's powers in the Matrix.  He manipulates the base objects that makeup a human being (Man-Animal-Organism-Cell-Atom-Subatomic)and morphs into those features.  In fact, all the other denizens of Zion have that power- Neo just understands it better.  This is probably where Morpheus(as in Anamorphic) gets his name.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I even bought the computer game Enter the Matrix to fill that gap, yet when I actually saw this movie, I couldn't help but feel disappointment. Don't get me wrong, it's a solid film, with some of the best action sequences I have ever seen, as were the mind bendingly good special effects, yet after the first movie, which set a standard for sci-fi flicks, with its cool, sleek slow-mo trickery and good, original plot, this sequel seemed to lack a little something.  The acting was good, especially Keanu and Fishburne, the action great, yet the plot and timing of scenes was disappointing.  For every good scene, there was a mediocre scene involving theories, twists and the like.  Also the action scenes, although good, did seem to drag on, for instance the car chase.  However the agent Smith fight and the great hallway battle with all the old weapons were great. The Matrix - we all remember that film, it pretty much ""made"" bullet time, and we all remember ""that"" lobby scene and the danger of which the agents possessed.  Yet in Reloaded there was no real fear of anything, as Neo is all powerful anyway.  Also the scenes were not as memorable, which was a bummer. Overall though, this film is a solid, although not truly amazing piece of cinema, which surprises us and bewilders us with its array of tricks and bullets, with good acting and a sadly forgettable film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Good action, lazy script....","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704754/?ref_=tt_urv","Leon_Salmon@hotmail.com","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1777492/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2003","I am huge fan of Hong Kong Cinema, but before I comment about this film I would like to just point out one problem I had with the first film as well as this one, Keanu Reeves, no offense to the guy but I feel that he is terribly mis-cast and doesn't convey as a credible martial artist on screen. His movements are very limited which makes me wonder why they bothered with him in the first place. These films are crying out for the likes of Jet Li, or even Jackie Chan in a serious role perhaps,maybe rising star Donnie Yen would have looked better.Anyway look at me getting all carried away....about Matrix Reloaded....why they felt the need to have the audience sit for over an hour before anything really happens is beyond me. But once the action picks up you just hope that you are not once again diverted back to another hour of pointless dialogue.The fight sequences are longer and much more elaborate in this movie, however they do suffer the 'Tomb Raider syndrome', none of the hero's look as if they're in any danger and just walk through the kung fu with ease. Atleat in the first film Neo struggled to defend himself against one agent, but here he manages to take on hundreds of upgrades with out any injury whatsoever. There is no denying that Yeun Woo Ping is a genius choreographer, but I couldn't help but feel as if he had took a back seat on this one and left alot of the work to his assistant Dion Lam, with the fight scenes lacking the gritty realism of the first one.The Highway chase was very well directed however the build up to it did lose it's impact slightly. I felt that the twins were only introduced to give the audience a break from the over use of the agents, and I think that this becomes more obvious by their premature send off. Considering the press coverage they've been receiving over here, they were only in the film for about five minutes. Who knows they're bound to pop up in the next instalment.I have to comment on Morpheus's blue screen battle on top of a moving truck, what a big mistake, the idea sounds excellent in theory, but no matter how many times I try to believe its really happening, blue screen steals my imagination, nice try though fella's.After this we end up slipping back into more endless dialogue about making choices and then guess what....Neo saves Trinity, at this point the hairs are supposed to be standing up on the back of your neck, but it doesn't work.....why?.....because it's cheesy, I feel that they should have gone in a completely different direction with this scene, give the audience a sense of danger lurking, but they didn't. Again the proceedings seem a little too easy for our heroes.To be honest the ending isn't that bad, but again the build up to it loses it's impact.....could we really care less what happens next?Over all I have great respect for the Wachowski Bros or any other Directors who can produce movies of this spectacle, however, I feel that the first movie was very personal to the Wachowski's, but it looks as if the studio's have interfered too much with this one and turned it into a typical Hollywood Blockbuster.It ends up being two and half hours of mindless entertainment....but it shouldn't have been. After checking out the trailer for the final instalment it looks as if it could end being more of the same, fingers crossed it will be an improvement.My hopes for plot on the next one, Neo snuffs it Trinity gives birth to his son....but I'm expecting a typical end reel fight sequence, Neo saves the day and lives the rest of his life in the real world. Well that's Hollywood for Ya!I can only look forward to Jackie Chan's next project the Medallion, and Donnie Yen's lensing a project with Producer Joel Silver titled Chinese Bros, plus other belated projects from Jet Li and Chow Yun Fat. I just hope that one of these projects will deliver a full meal, because that is what I would have liked to have got from Matrix Reloaded.Atleast it wasn't as bad as Attack of the Clones....zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I wasn't exactly sure what to expect, and it was very different to what I thought it would be, but I enjoyed it all the same. If, however, the film was a lot more like the first one, it would have just been repetitive.

Was the wait too long had my expectations been hyped too far by the cries of revolutionary effects and fight scenes to die for. All i know is that after 20 minutes i began to shuffle, you may comment that maybe i just had an uncomfortable seat and that this isn't exactly a high brow way to rate a film but all i know is that when i shuffle it means i'm bored. The whole thing just smacks of indulgence. The love scene cut with the dancing new age traveller looking zion people (How long?), the cake scene(Schoolboy smut), the over use of camera angles and cuts in the fight scenes that betrayed the balletic quality of the first film. And the shocking amount of animation that they've used to make scenes possible. Don't get me wrong, there are some awesome scenes, the motorbike scene in paticular was spectacular, but for every good point it was countered with a bad. Then i start too feel bad, maybe the wait had been too long, that i had let myself over hype the film in my head. Hoping for something close too perfection and then feeling let down when it failed to live up too expectation. Then i come round and realise that after all the hype i had a right to expect something more. That the brothers who made the film maybe have too much control and need to know when to reign themselves in, less of the computer trickery and more of the story telling that was displayed in the first film.

 A lot had been expected from the sequel. I watched it here in Mumbai the first day it was released here and yes... it WAS a one of those rare mind-blowing effects I had ever experienced whenever I watch this type of movies. This movie definitely lives to the expectations created by the Legendary Prequel in 1999. Not Only this has a lot of Action and Animation but it also has an intelligent Concept.It carries off exactly from where it had left in the ""The Matrix"".The more we talk of these Matrix movies, the less it is. But the parts of this movie I was attracted to, were... 1)The Cause and Effect Philosophy: This is,If I am not wrong,really the same as proved by the legendary scientist and discoverer Isaac Newton. (But fortunately, Isaac may have never known anything about such a thing called 'Lipstick' or  the locations on the body where its imprints could be found.)   2)The Explanation by The Architect: The explanation as per offered by the Architect reminded me of the teachings of The (Actual) One, Lord Krishna to his disciple,the Legendary Warrior Arjuna when he is face to face with his enemies in the Final War ...and his enemies are nothing but his own relatives.And Arjuna is caught in a deleimma. Then the Lord offers him Two Options :A)To succumb to his Emotions ,not to offer a fight and get Destroyed and in turn as a result, be the cause for the destruction of Humanity.OR B) To control his emotions and fight to Win,resulting in the protection of Humanity and Truth.This also will result in Arjuna becoming a more powerful one and help him  create a more efficient Kingdom.Arjuna wisely chooses the Second Option.Similarly,The Architect offers Neo Two Options:A)To succumb to his Emotions and go back to Trinity, resulting in the Avalanche-Type Catastrophe which will Destroy Zion and Humanity in General.OR B) To dodge his Emotions,Get dissolved himself and also the Matrix temporarily and result in a new and an Efficient Matrix which would be created by the Architect.Unfortunately, Neo chooses the First Option.Anyway, Now let's get out of Philosophy. I would rate this movie the same as I rated its Prequel, that is 9 OUT OF 10 or ...4 OUT OF 5; whichever way it goes.As far as the Action and the Special (Both Visual & Sound)Effects are concerned, they are simply as they should have been,Terrific.But WAIT,WAIT,WAIT... According to me, this not The Best-REALISTIC-Scientific Movie Ever made. The credit Deservedly goes to the Steven Speilberg's ""ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE(2001)"". AI is simply a Down-to-Earth and MATURE movie.Unfortunately,in this world ,a majority of people crave for Quantity and not Quality.But even then, it does NOT take anything away from the Matrix Series.Now I am waiting (as everybody),for the concluding part which completes the Trilogy and also for the Larger-Than-Life ""Terminator 3:Rise of the Machines(2003)"".","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It goes much further indepth than the old one did, although some of the fighting is much more pointless, I'll admit.  The Smith fight gets really old, and pointless, but otherwise the fighting is pretty cool.  It all looks cool, but the best part of it is the philosophy behind it.  One has to ask himself, how deep the rabbit-hole really goes.  This phrase takes on a whole new meaning after thinking about the various monologues.  I have spent almost a day thinking about the meaning behind it, and am yet to come to a final conclusion.  I'll have to watch it a few more times to get all the details straight.  This is not a bad thing, don't take it wrong, I would much rather have a script of the monologues than anything else right now, so I can get straght what exactly is happening.  Guess I'll have to wait to the next one to finally understand it though.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There are, occasionally, exceptions to this rule, and The Matrix 2 is a fine example of this.  No doubt, there are probably masses of belief systems out there that proclaim that The Matrix is a testimony for their type of belief or whatever, ie. Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism, Islam; even occultist groups and philosophies.  But it is in my viewpoint from all of the knowledge that I have searched that there is a book that explains the matrix (lowercase), ie. What the Matrix is (whatisthematrix). I didn't realize that this wasn't obvious to everyone until I read what other people have said about this film and the one before it and it is apparent that they really don't have a clue.  It is a pictorial metaphoric film which is written in code, and to fully understand, you must be well versed in many disciplines (i.e. programming/hacking, philosophy, mathematics, neuro-physiology, film theory, psychiatry, and sociology, for starters).  Thus, it can be understood why it is difficult for the masses to understand a film like this one, even less than the one before it, calling it just ""sci-fi"" or ""comic book"" or ""action"" film, which is not doing the film justice.  Although it may be any or all of these, the viewer cannot possibly understand what is the matrix until after reading the book ""The Neo-Tech Discovery"" by Dr. Frank R. Wallace.  This book must be read from start to finish to understand the book.  It is much like this film, but in written form.  The book is also written in a Matrix puzzle form and you won't understand how it relates to the movie/s The Matrix until this book has been read.  So that is the best information I can give you without writing volumes, as I'm sure there are many factions writing books on these films, even as I write this.  Also, one more thing: This was a very cool movie to watch.  Go see it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first Matrix was exsistential, philosophical, constantly putting in my head the question, ""Could something like this possibly be true?   Could there be an alternate universe?""You learn everything you need to know about the Matrix in the first movie. The fun was discovering the splinter in the back of Neo's mind.   That was the Matrix for me.   I don't want to see crappy dialogue and bad attempts at trying to explain things further while being sprinkled with fight scenes that furthered the story no more.And why have Agent Smith and Neo become Immortals?    You know it's true. There is no way to defeat either.    Agent Smith, in my mind, was like and anti-virus program and Neo and company were the virus.   In Reloaded we see that Agent Smith is copying himself and copying himself.   Great.   We have Neo fighting 50 Agent Smiths now.   Pointless.Why bother having the Oracle in Reloaded?   ""Zion will fall.""   No crap. The people in Zion are cyber-geeks.   Intelligent.   Could they not figure that out for themselves.Matrix Reloaded wanted to be much more than it was.

But I couldn't help feeling that what I was getting was not so much a separate film in an ongoing series(think The Godfather, Star Wars or Lord of the Rings) but only Part 1 of the sequel to The Matrix. Without the second film, Matrix Reloaded means nothing. It's a collection of terrific scenes bundled together in a plot that won't make sense until the third film hits the cinemas at Christmas. If you want to know what Matrix Reloaded is all about, you're going to HAVE to go to number three. So what the studio is getting is, in effect, two full price box office admissions for one film split into two.

It wasnt God awful but it was far from anything special. That being said....When I first heard about the Matrix Reloaded I didnt really care about it at all. After seeing a couple more previews I began to get more and more excited until finally I wound up going to a midnight show the day before it was officially released. Man was it a letdown. I like the first movie a ton but after watching this one I may need to rewatch the first one to see if I still enjoy it. The Matrix Reloaded is like going out on a date with a really attractive person who also just happens to be one of the dumbest people on the planet. Yeah I realize the dialogue is written a certain way on purpose, but that doesnt make it good. Does anyone realize just how horrible of an actor Keanu Reeves is? I hope so. The basic story itself just borrows from so many other movies and books-I never really realized it during the first one but when they go out of their way to cram it into your heads just what is going on you cant help but notice it during the second movie. Its like they think the intelligence level of their target audience went down 100 iq points and felt the need to spell out everything REPEATEDLY. The special effects of course were spectacular but they can only take a movie so far. By the end of the movie I was anxious to leave the theater.

I would have to say that I fall into the former category, but that only raised my expectations for `The Matrix: Reloaded', because I remembered that Keanu Reeves was the star and well, I'll get to that little bit later.	At the conclusion of the first installment, we have learned that Neo (Keanu Reeves) is The One meant to end the struggle between the humans and the Matrix controllers, the machines. Now, we can see that his abilities have grown to basically encompass your typical superhero superpowers. But Zion, the last refuge of humanity, is in peril, as a quarter million machines are digging to eradicate it.	It is now up to Neo, his lover Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) and his friend Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) to find an end to the war and save Zion. Along the Kung-fu, explosion-laden way, they employ the talents of many allies-Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith), the Keymaker (Russell Duk Kim) and the Oracle (Gloria Foster)-to overcome the obstacles thrown in their paths by such villains as the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson), The Twins (Adrian and Neil Raymont), and the multiple Agent Smiths (Hugo Weaving) in their search for the final victory.	After the first `Matrix' debuted, the entire world of Hollywood Special Effects was thrown asunder as what was shown was ground-breaking and jaw-dropping. The bar has been raised again. Without delving into too many details, I can safely tell you that the fight scenes within are of the ilk that have never been seen before and had me saying to myself `Did I just see that?'	That said, the philosophical and theological leanings of the film had me a bit flummoxed. I get the whole philosophy/theology thing and I can understand the importance and significance that it carries, but WHY must certain points be expounded upon over and over? It would seem that the Wachowski brothers who wrote it have not been acquainted with Dire Straits, who succinctly summed up my point in `Industrial Disease'-`Philosophy is useless, Theology is worse.' Amen to that.	I alluded to my distaste for Mr. Reeves earlier in this piece, and I would like to think that it was somewhat correct. In some ways in `The Matrix: Reloaded', he is the perfect character for his role, but then he takes to speaking for more than a line or two and things go downhill. The same goes for Laurence Fishburne, who becomes tedious during his speech-making. It might be a shock coming from me, but concision is important.	On the other hand, I was nothing if not delighted with the performances given by Lambert Wilson and Hugo Weaving as a pair of characters maybe not intrinsically evil, but close enough. They were, by no small means, the acting performances to of the film.	When `The Matrix Reloaded' is pared down to its essentials, it works extremely efficiently as an action vehicle, but at times, the dogmatization within wears thin and becomes more of a burden and a far-too-often repeated point, so on the whole, Matrix v. 2.0 gets a 7.5 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I consider the first Matrix to be one of the top five films of all time, and so I would be the most anxious and also the most hesitant to see if the magic could be repeated twice more. And after seeing Reloaded, my awe and adulation for the Wachowski's has only deepened.Trust me, ignore any negative reviews (although the negative ones are getting more attention than the positive ones, which are vastly in the majority) - it's on a different plane to the original, so you can't compare accurately. The first one was a landmark, so of course Reloaded won't be covering entirely new territory, and it's stupid to expect it to.What Reloaded does is exactly what a sequel/continuation should do, which is add to the story, open new paths, and yes, blow away previous effects completely, and it manages this perfectly. One critic wrote something along the lines of ""the action bogs down horribly between set-pieces"", which to me just shows that they were being very narrow-minded in their expectations. Nothing gets bogged down - there's just a lot of this lost art called ""plot"". I find it ironic that in a time when no-brainer tech-fests are churned out at an alarming rate, when a film of meaning and substance comes out (with effects far surpassing any seen in any other film) - it is criticized for it!The philosophizing is relevant and interesting, although admitedly it is a bit too complex in terms of wording and length - it is the films only downfall (and its a pretty minor one at that) but it is no more complex than what was in the first film, and adds to the depth of the story and makes for interesting secondary characters.Anything people don't like about this film seems to be largely based on their expectations or lack of understanding, rather than the films own merits. Expecting more action or less plot, and disappointed? That's your problem, not the films. Complaining that it starts too slowly? Again, adjust your expectations. It does start relatively slowly, but that's the nature of the plot - writing in a big action scene before we really know what's going on would be far too forced. Likewise the ending - it's been made very clear that the Matrix trilogy is more one normal length film and one very long film in two parts than a traditional trilogy, but still some people seem to think that the way it ends is somehow ""wrong"".The visuals (it goes without saying) are like nothing you've ever seen before - there's even an element of comedy to the way that Neo practically plays ten-pin bowling with the Agents! And the freeway sequence is almost 15 minutes of pure adrenaline - surpassing any and all expectations I had of the action. The fight sequences are expertly choreographed and filmed showing progression from the first film.One which sticks in my mind is the fight in the chateau entrance hall -four people cart wheeling/somersaulting/jumping across and around the room, >in one wide shot. CGI or real life? Doesn't matter, because it was absolutely stunning regardless. If it was CGI, it was so well done that you couldn't tell, and if it was live action, the co-ordination needed to get four actors positioned properly on wires deserves some kind of special award.My only concern is if Revolutions knows its way out of the labyrinth it's worked its way into by the mind-blowing twist at the end. But I'm sure that like with this film, the Wachowski brothers will not only meet my expectations, but exceed them!P.S. SEE ""THE ANIMATRIX""!! Apart from expanding on The Matrix universe, it has some truly sensational and beautiful stories and animation!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I encourage everyone, be they man, woman, child, animal, vegetable, or mineral to spend their money elsewhere then on a movie ticket for this thing.  I expect ""To Be Continued"" when I am watching some pointless sitcom on television, throwing this into a film is just wrong. Your time and money should be valuable enough to expect some sense of resolution after spending two hours with a film.  I don't care if a movie is two hours long or six hours long, I want to feel that I have accomplished something besides indebting myself another movie ticket to see the ending. This is a disgrace.  A hard wipe to the credits would have been a thousand times more tactful.That being said I must take a deep breath and tell you my other thoughts on this piece of work (It's a piece of something all right).  At best, this is just a screensaver of action sequences.  This would be okay if they did not pause every five seconds as if my computer were freezing up.  It's as if the filmmakers did not think we could understand a car being smashed without seeing it occur over about five minutes.  Action is action, and slow action is BOOOOOOOORRING.  The rest of the film is a feeble attempt to coble a story together.  You can throw in every word in the dictionary and use every trick of circular reasoning to try to make it seem intelligent, but no one is fooled: you could drive a truck through the plot holes in this movie. There are loose ends beyond count, and even one should be a  travesty.  I give this movie a to be continued.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I didn't want to have any of the good stuff spoiled, or be distracted by what other people said was bad. So I'm tempted to just say, ""Reloaded was awesome, go see it."" But I gotta say more. I won't give anything away, but if you're a die hard Matrix fan, you might want to stop reading and just go see it.Part of what made the first Matrix so cool was figuring out what the Matrix actually was. Obviously, we can't have that experience again, so this movie is a little different. But still excellent. For a good contrast, we get to learn more about the machines, and more about the human city of Zion. There's more time to watch all the characters be badass of course. And if you thought there wouldn't be any more big revelations... get ready for a lot of what you thought you understood about the first film to get called into question.I like to think I'm a pretty smart guy, but I found myself saying, ""Wha? Wait, go back and say that again."" But my DVD remote wouldn't pause or rewind the big screen. I think I got it figured out, but I might find my understanding totally off the mark after I see Reloaded again (or when I see Matrix Revolutions, which I hope will wrap up all remaining questions). So for those who criticize the story, I gotta assume that they didn't understand everything, or just didn't like the ideas. To say the movie has no plot isn't accurate. There's lots of deep stuff going on. Almost too much. It definitely requires more than one viewing to soak it all in.The visual effects are amazing, as you'd expect. Nothing is too over the top in Matrix land. They had to top what they did in the first one. If you liked watching two guys doing some one-on-one kung fu fighting, wait until they throw in dozens more people, speeding vehicles, more weapons, and characters with new powers. I can't imagine how they can go any bigger in the 3rd movie, but I hear they do and I can't wait.Be sure to stay through the credits, for some preview footage of the next installment. And until Revolutions hits theaters in November, you can watch the Animatrix shorts, and play the Enter The Matrix game. Both of which supposedly give you greater insight into the overall story. Some might say this is a marketing scheme to get Matrix fans to spend more cash, but that's fine by me. I'm a fan, and I like that they are releasing some additional Matrix material as long as it's quality stuff.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Two of the fight scene's are pretty cool, but it feels like you are watching a video game. There is no plot to keep you interested in what happens.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Unlike the first film, this movie had several clunky parts to it, like that extended Zion dance scene near the beginning of the film that went on a lot longer than it should have, and all that stuff about ""keymaker"" and the like (kind of reminded me of ""Ghostbusters"" a bit).  Maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention, but I thought that some of the exposition was virtually incomprehensible -- the movie was definitely more ""talky"" than the first one (or maybe the exposition in the first one was just executed better, I don't know).  Reloaded, at times, reminded me of some made for TV sci-fi show.At first, I was a bit unhappy with how Morpheus had really turned into this religious-type leader, but that turned out to be a pretty good aspect of the film, particularly when you consider the plot twist at the end that I won't go into.  For the most part, the effects were pretty good, as were the fighting scenes.  I'm looking forward to seeing the conclusion of this movie in November.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So my expectations to the sequel were quite high. I was disappointed.The Story in my opinion is trash. The first movie really got that special ""kick"" from the story. You got great action sequences, a good story, and some philosophical themes to think of.Well to me it looks like the directors thought ""well it worked so well the first time lets try it again"" and packed a whole load of philosophical ""stuff"" and story elements into it. For me it just didn't work out. All the elements are not linked together and are highly confusing (especially the dialogue with the ""Matrix Creator"" ask 4 people about it and be sure that you will get 4 different explanations).
Well lets get to the highlight of this movie: The action sequences. They easily the best ones ever made. The often mentioned Neo-Smith sequence with ""its computerish"" look didn't really bother me. What is much worse in my eyes that those sequences mostly didn't make any sense. It's like Neo walks in a room and the first thing he does is beating up somebody. The fight sequences didn't evolve from the story, they were just there. Talking, fighting, talking, fighting, talking, fighting.Finally if you loved Matrix you will watch Matrix Reloaded anyways. If you don't belong to that group think twice before you watch it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I saw it on opening day, so obviously I really wanted to see it - but whether or not it is better than the original is open for debate.High points:  The special effects - I saw both of the last Star Wars movies on opening day also, and I don't recall ever being to a movie, those two included, where the audience applauded the EFFECTS.  They are simply incredible.  See the movie, and you will be talking about  scenes around the water cooler for days.  They are THAT good.  Also, the fighting is among the best I have ever seen, bar none, and I could watch it all day.  Some of the stunts are ""over the top"" as has been mentioned elsewhere, but no more so than some other popular, recent action flicks.  It's a comic book adapted for the screen, people - it's SUPPOSED to be eye candy!  I say it succeeds at that, in spades.Low points:  The pacing is spotty, and some of the scenes are badly contrived.  The plot doesn't chug along as nicely as the original.  I don't mind the self-referential humor, but this movie sometimes really tries to be all things to all people, and suffers because of that.  There is some seemingly forced affection between Neo and Trinity which I think we could have accepted without proof - after all, who among us is going to ""Reloaded"" for the romance?   There is also relatively gratuitous sex thrown in for good measure, in the form of an underground ""rave"" - although it takes place in a temple as opposed to a ""dance club"" as someone said.  I have no problem with sex, but this seemed out of place, and had no plot impact whatsoever. Finally, the movie grinds to a halt with an aggravatingly obtuse lecture at the end that could have made use of much smaller words (and less latin) and the mindblowing would have been no less.  Oh well.Yeah, I would have done some things in the movie differently.  But I admit that I'll watch it again, AND I'll buy the DVD, AND I can't wait to see ""Revolutions,"" too.  What are you waiting for?  Hurry up and go see it!  8 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

""Reloaded"" borrows perhaps too much on the original's success to truly stand on its own as a story but it really *is* a good piece of entertainment nonetheless.  If you like action, it has lots; if you want story development from the original, it has -- well, if not *lots* than at least *some*.  Flawed but worthy.  Like most humans.I'm going to take a deep bend out of work-a-day reality for a moment so bear with me, please (or don't, it's your choice).  ""The Matrix"" and ""Reloaded"" are a classic (if a little clumsy) ascent from the mundane to the exalted along a path followed by mystics throughout the ages.  It is a story line greatly familiar by now: a person of humble origins is mysteriously chosen to be the savior (of whatever) and their journey takes them to heights that they cannot comprehend.In Qabalistic terms, Zion is in Malkuth, the earth plane.  They are beset by demons from the Matrix (Yesod, the plane of dreams -- or the astral plane, if you will).  Neo, a savior of the archetype ""the sacrificed god"" (the ""Magical Image"" of Tiphareth) emerges to reconnect Zion with ""the Source"" -- Kether.  The mechanism Neo and his cohorts use to achieve this goal use a lot more Geburah (violence) than is to my taste but, hey, it's a movie that needs to sell to a lot of 17 year old guys to make a profit.There were a lot of little gems in the film for those who might be paying attention to something other than the Kung-fu and Trinity's patent leather suit (though, in truth, this writer gave the latter due weight).  I liked that the head-honcho Matrix hacker is named ""Morpheus"", after the Greek god of dreams.  We get ""morphine"" from this name as well as a lot of words that have to do with change.  In the scene with Merovingian (which is, BTW, the name of a Dynasty of the late Roman Empire), the latter offers our heros food and drink after introducing his wife as Persephone (and you know what happens if you eat or drink the food of the gods!).  There were numerous other tasty bits like this, giving me reason to see ""Reloaded"" a second time.  Perhaps in October.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie is better than 95% of the movies out there right now. This movie is cooler than anything that is on the big screen right now. This movie is the visual synthesis of a pure testosterone drip. For those of you who didn't quite follow what I just said, this is one of the best films I have ever seen in my life. Before seeing it, I was afraid that it might be just a bunch of disconnected, unnecessary kung-fu sequences strung together by something that might kindly be called a plot. I thought that since everyone knew that it was going to be a monster success no matter what it contained, they may have focussed more on the coolness than on the story (which, while the effects and kung-fu were awesome, it was always the story that kept me coming back to the film over and over again). Fortunately, I was wrong in my suspicions. If anything, this movie has more; story to it than the last one. We get to find out more about the Matrix itself, Zion, the human resistance, and the characters that we came to love in the first film.

With great enthusiasm and expectation I had gone to the movie, but came back with a big disappointment.Story, neither complicated as the former one nor philosophical. At some situations, the director tried to include some philosophy explaining choice, destiny and bla..bla..bla.. but the explanation makes the movie still boring. Special effects, as amazing as the previous one but may be we are used to slow motion shots, it is no more exciting. Technology, nothing novel but for the Agent replication. Although the motorcycle race is taken stunningly, it is nothing special on a movie of Matrix kind. May be my expectations have gone high!The architect of the Matrix says at one point that the Matrix is quite old, Yes it is true. It is 4 years after the first release not only that Neo, Trinity and the Agent have grown old but for Morpheus. AT last, Trinity almost dies towards the end and I thought we will get another actress in the concluding part but she survives.To make the movie still long and boring, there are couple of scenes totally not required. Link meeting his family and Neo-Trinity romance. They do not add any value to the movie. We could see Zion in this movie but it never looks interesting and we feel like asking for this only, all the trouble?On a whole, the movie is ok, but can never compete with the first part. Let us hope if we get a better concluding part, if not the best.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

One of the underlying themes of the movie is that they are still only human. EXACTLY!!! what do you think this scene is for!! They are human. They have gone through fear and know they are preparing to face the fear with no qualms. They are celebrating in what they know may be the last celebration. They aren't machines, they are humans. They are living. As for the love scene. I thought it was one of the most provoking points in the movie. Yet again, they are only human. They are in love. they haven't had one another in god knows how long. Neo knows that Trinity will die. They love, they need to love. in one of the other comments some one commented on how fake the scene was because they wanted each other so much but they were going so slow. THey are savoring one another. They do want each other, but they also want to know how each other feels. The rave/love scene i believe is one of the most poinient scenes in the movie, because they are only human.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Remove the heads of Andy Wachowski and Larry Wachowski from their own backsides, using force if necessary.2. Cut down on the use of slow-motion; not only would it cut down on the overuse of such a device, but it would make the movie a lot shorter.3. Invest in acting lessons for the cast.4. Put in more moments like Trinity asking for a crash-course on stealing a motorcycle to be downloaded, only for the Keymaker to make a key for the bike on the spot. This is known as ""humour,"" something of which a bit more would not go amiss.5. Stop putting insufferably pompous and heavy-handed dialogue into nearly everyone's mouth. Especially Laurence Fishburne's.6. Endless Agent Smiths stops being impressive with overuse. Please bear that in mind.7. Complex action scenes don't work when we don't care about the characters, which is why the massive freeway chase doesn't come off.8. The movie is absolutely wonderful when Monica Bellucci is on screen (her beauty and body are the movie's most amazing special effects; admitteldy she isn't too comfortable in this milieu, but how would you like it if English wasn't your first language and you had to speak it here - with a French accent yet?). Unfortunately in ""The Matrix Reloaded"" there are 128 minutes where such is not the case. 9. Do not make the first hour or so such a tedious talk-fest.
10. There is no need for several endings when only one will suffice.11. Don't assume everyone in the world lives and breathes ""The Matrix."" The movie suffers from being too wrapped up in itself for all but the most devoted of fans to get the full effect; there are enough of them for AOL Time Warner to make their money back, but the original movie wasn't as brilliant as it thought it was, and this one is even less. Instead of being the extension of an impressive movie, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is little more than a return to ""Chain Reaction"" territory for Keanu Reeves.Maybe endless clones of Monica Bellucci would have helped...","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Well, I thought it was an example of the Wachowski brothers thinking outside the box.  If there were only 250,000 humans remaining on earth, how would they behave?  Which culture would be dominant?  Since the USA represents only 260 million of the planet's 5 billion inhabitants, the odds of our culture being dominant are slim.  The culture in Zion appeared to resemble some African cultures.  Another great aspect of the film were the number of people of color represented in the movie.  Unlike Star Wars, Star Trek, Buck Rogers, and many other movies about the future, African Americans didn't just suddenly vanish off the face of the earth.

If you didn't see the first one, what the hell are you waiting for?Now, a few things about it:The good: The action is sweet. Forget the crap you hear that the big sequences dissapoint. They don't - unless you're a nerd who can quote the Matrix by heart, dresses like Neo and thinks that he, too, is ""The One."" The Burly Brawl and the car chase had the theater cheering when I saw it. There are a few quick moments where things look a tad fake, but they pass quickly. Overall, the effects are some of the best ever put on film.The bad: It seems like whenever a character is seen for the first time in the film, he or she must deliver a five-minute, eye-glazing monologue. Sometimes it's necessary, sometimes it's not. There's a lot of information to take in, and unfortunately it's mostly delivered like a boring philosophy lecture.The reason some people don't like it: I think it's because the mystery from the first film is missing. You already know the deal with the Matrix (or do you?) and so it just becomes an action movie.

To that, I say may be true when the second, or third, is not part of the original plan, and was just made because the first did so well. But, The matrix was written to be a series. Look at X2. Not that it is better than the first as far as quality goes, but it was better, way more intense than the first! Or look at LOTR.

While not without its flaws, this film delivers an entertaining and thought-provoking continuation of the saga, expanding the scope of the original while introducing new layers of complexity to its narrative.Picking up where its predecessor left off, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" follows Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus as they continue their struggle against the oppressive machines that control humanity. As Neo grapples with his destiny as ""The One"" and the looming threat of the machine army, the film delves deeper into the mysteries of the Matrix, introducing new characters, concepts, and revelations along the way.One of the film's greatest strengths is its action sequences, which are nothing short of spectacular. From the thrilling freeway chase to the gravity-defying battles against swarms of Agent Smiths, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" delivers pulse-pounding excitement that will leave audiences on the edge of their seats. The choreography and visual effects are top-notch, showcasing the Wachowskis' skill at crafting immersive and adrenaline-fueled action sequences.In addition to its action, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" also explores deeper philosophical themes, delving into questions of fate, choice, and the nature of reality. While some of the film's philosophical musings may border on the esoteric, they add depth and complexity to the narrative, inviting audiences to ponder the nature of existence and the limits of human understanding.However, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is not without its flaws. The film's pacing can be uneven at times, with certain scenes feeling overly drawn-out or repetitive. Additionally, the abundance of new characters and plot threads introduced in the film can occasionally lead to confusion or overload, as the narrative juggles multiple storylines simultaneously.Despite these shortcomings, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" remains a worthy successor to the original film, building upon its foundation with a thrilling and ambitious sequel that expands the universe in exciting new directions. Whether you're drawn in by its action-packed set pieces or its thought-provoking themes, ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is sure to leave a lasting impression on fans of the franchise.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Even more disappointing than many reviews indicate.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704722/?ref_=tt_urv","Cadriel","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0851463/?ref_=tt_urv","31 May 2003","I have a fairly strong background with science fiction and philosophy, and while I think the original Matrix is highly overrated both as SF and as philosophy, I have to admit:  it is an action film par excellence.  Not so with the sequel.On a science fiction level, the sequel never really manages to get over the embarassingly silly idea of the first one, with the ""humans as batteries"" explanation.  And I have to say, Zion is the home base in a hundred different banal space operas; why did the Matrix franchise feel the need to ape this bad cliche?  Philosophically, it's weaker; rather than as a sort of exploration on the same lines as Descartes' famous essay that led to his conclusion, ""I think, therefore I am,"" the Matrix Reloaded tries to deal with the problems of free will and causality, which are almost unbreachable in film.  The film has some ponderous dialogue about causation, but there's no nuance to it, nothing to suggest that any characters have any interest in the subtleties of modern philosophy.  I'd love to see a filmic depiction of something like the Frankfurt example (where a hypothetical person is about to make a choice, but is then literally forced to make that same choice - bringing the ""could have done otherwise"" principle of free will-based morality into question), or in general dealing with the rather fascinating subject of whether or not we make the choices that we seem to make. Despite the claims of some of its supporters, the Matrix Reloaded offers nothing insightful into this discourse.  It's a shame, because the first movie did open up a lot of people into realms of philosophy.The plot is also much less focused.  The entire first film can be mapped on the Campbell-derived hero's journey structure; while I'm not a proponent of the structure myself, I have to admit it makes for solid plotting in its own particular niche (proven by Star Wars and The Matrix).  The sequel's plot is much more stereotypical genre hackwork:  the hero goes from destination to destination, collecting plot coupons and using them along the way.  That it is set up in such a way that insufferable, wooden dialogue and stock SF in Zion precedes insufferable, wooden dialogue in the formerly more interesting Matrix only serves to make the film's plot dry and of interest only to that sort of fan who made up explanations for why the human-as-battery thing worked in the first one.  The twist of the Architect's speech was really the only interesting part of it all, and I must admit it makes me curious as to how they'll finish it up.  All in all, though, it does a terrible job of structuring and delivering its plot.And then there's the action.  Reportedly, this is the reason we all came, to see Neo dancing on the faces of a hundred Agent Smiths and a killer car chase scene.  And I'm all one for good medieval weapon fighting and car chases and kung fu, so don't get me wrong here.  It looked really cool in the trailer, and indeed on screen - but it was all just sound and fury, signifying nothing.  The battle with the Agent Smiths was completely uncompelling, because Neo was so good that he was never in any danger. The same went for the whole business with the weapon fight sequence.  Even the acclaimed freeway sequence was too long, and it kept pushing the heroes to the brink and then bringing them back so many times that it stopped being interesting and became trite and boring.  Slow motion was used because it looked cool, not to emphasize any interesting aspects of the fight scene. Good action depends on the audience caring about the outcome, and that is not in the Matrix: Reloaded.  Watch the original movie again; in every single scene, right up until the end, the characters' lives and missions are in very real danger; it makes the race to get to a phone nailbiting stuff, the relief on seeing no body palpable.  The Matrix Reloaded doesn't even come close to this level, instead hoping that you will be so dazzled by sfx and choreography that you won't care that the fights are pointless, long, and have no dramatic impact.And the special effects are glitzy indeed, but frankly - there's nothing in them that we haven't seen a hundred times since the original movie debuted. What the Wachowski brothers really proved was that CGI, when mixed with reality, still looks fake no matter how much money you spend on it.It's really a shame; the first movie was quite intriguing and really intense in the action department.  The sequel isn't even in the same class.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Matrix is back. We've waited four years for its return and been subject to the most intense hype since the revival of the ""Star Wars"" saga in 1999, so can it possibly fulfil expectations? If those expectations are realistic, then essentially it does. No sequel could be as mindblowingly original as the first offering with the basic concept of all our world as a virtual prison or of the body-twisting, gravity-defying special effects or of the super cool characters in black leather and shades. Yet technically this is another amazingly accomplished work with some sequences - the opening one with Trinity, Neo's fight with 100 versions of Agent Smith, the conflict on the twin staircase, and above all the spectacular freeway chase - being enormous fun, even if the last looks like a video game (which, of course, much of the film's material now is). The eroticism which was latent in the first movie is now much more explicit, possibly reflecting the complicated sexuality of at least one of the Wachowski brothers. One-time model Carrie-Anne Moss looks more gaunt this time (although more capable than ever as a fighting machine) and we have to look to another former model, the delectable Monica Bellucci who presents Neo with his most original challenge, to admire genuine feminine curves. Meanwhile the rave scene in labyrinthine Zion is an odd sequence for a sci-fi movie and looks more like a slot on MTV.Neo's powers - already extraordinary by the end of the previous movie - have now become awesome, even God-like. Crew member Link refers to him ""doing his Superman thing"" and seemingly he can raise a woman from the dead. This makes him appear less heroic and more comic book. However, the main weakness of the sequel is the pretentiousness of its repeated philosophical expositions. There are already patients in American mental institutions who only speak Klingon and no doubt soon there will be some who think that ""The Matrix"" is a new religion. Finally, it's as well to be forewarned of the abrupt ending, a la ""The Empire Strikes Back"", which leaves us hanging and gasping for ""The Matrix Revolutions"".Footnote 1: If you sit through the absolutely endless credits, naming every plasterer and painter in the US and Australia, you'll see a trailer for ""The Matrix Revolutions"".Footnote 2: ""The Matrix Reloaded"" will be soon be released in an IMAX version - and that should be mega.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I don't know anyone who would really dispute this fact. Well actually I do, but I think their totally wrong. The storyline is advanced beyond anything I've seen in recent mainstream cinema in America. The story itself is so intertwined with the animatrix and the video games, all adding into the side story, that it is more of a fans movie than anything (just my favorite.)Hell the Matrix is on the cover of my textbook for my cinema classes. This movie is amazing. The special effects are top-notch and timeless. The plotline actually IS amazing. I don't know what you would expect other than action from an action movie...the fact that they could intertwine this action with such an amazing plotline blows me away. I didn't get into the movie KNOWING the plot so I walked out AMAZED. The Matrix Reloaded blows away every expectation I had for the movie. This is what some people dislike because they want cinema to simply go their way. If their expectations are not met they are not pleased. But truly mind-blowing cinema destroys your expectations. That is what the Matrix Reloaded does. It blows away expectations and ends on a note that makes you WANT to return. I mean come on, if it ended with conclusion, wouldn't that make the third film in the trilogy pointless? And honestly, it's only a few months in-between them coming out, I think you can live with waiting. So in conclusion, it is only the disappointed and impatient movie-goers that will dislike this movie. The Matrix Reloaded is more amazing than I could describe.

Almost all of it looks amazing and it is fascinating what can be done in film these days. I'm sure this is what most people will feel when watching this film. On the other hand, no amount of CGI could save this film for me. CGI could not cover the weak plot, enhance the dull script or improve the quality of Keanu Reeves' acting. The character of Neo has become very similar to a comic book character, and this is in no way a good thing. Also, the romance between Neo and Trinity is tiresome and too drawn out during the film (note; I hope everyone despises the last two minutes as much as I). New characters (I believe the twins were the most looked forward to) were incredibly aggravating and, I hope, are not featured in length in the climactic film. This Matrix Reloaded is not to the standards of the first film. Any good critic would tell you it fires blanks, as long as they didn't sit in their seats drooling over effects that would have detracted them from the loose qualities of this movie!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It didn't beg for a sequel, yet we got Reloaded anyways...and soon to come, Revolutions. So with Reloaded we get the whole Zion thing goin on (Zionists rejoice...tsk tsk tsk :-P) and the human element. What's wrong with Reloaded is: (1) Story, and (2) Character Development.To explain number one, the story isn't all that well delivered to us. With the Zion environment, gone is the mystery and realism that made us, well at least me, love the first matrix so much. Not to say that it's all bad because I will go see Revolutions to see how it all ends, but for example, the big cliffhanger that's at the end, honestly it really isn't at all, because of problem #2. Number 2: Many more characters show up in Reloaded, like Persephone, the twins, a ""new"" agent smith(s), yet pretty much all these characters are so two dimensional. Their little screen time doesn't explain why they are there and why they are who they are, although the movie preaches ""purpose."" Unfortunately, it's hard to really connect with them and thus we have less feeling for what they do, and less feeling for the movie.Another element that was pretty underwhelming was the music. There were no really good thumping songs that you could remember afterwords. In the first movie you had prodigy, propellorheads, rob zombie remix...in this one the only song i ""got in to"" was the freeway chase scene, which btw is the scene that, if anything for this movie, is worth your money.So anyway, go watch it, because it is enjoyable - I was drinking a Lowenbrau maybe that helped too :-) - but just know that it's pretty average and it can't compare to the first movie...unless you're a graphics junkie/anime freak. Enjoy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I probably need to watch it again to do that.  Great visual efffects.  The highway scene was top notch.  i guarantee that it will be the best chase scene you ever saw. However, the first Neo fight sequence was a bit too cartoonish.  Great choreoraphy and camera angles as usual, but it looked obviously CG. That's why they wear black coats and sunglasses so that it will be easier to pull off.  But the movie redeems itself with the stairway fight scene with weapons.  Three words could have made this movie a lot better:  Industrial Light & Magic.Too much dialogue and bad editing job.  This movie is just under two and a half hours long.  Action scenes makes it worth while, but unnecessary scenes run too long and the actors babble on too much.  Anticipating the third one already.Overall, great movie.  I personally don't think The Matrix is as groundbreaking as everyone (including the modest cast and crew who tooted their horns a bit too much on Charlie Rose last night) thinks it is. That's just me.  The story is unique but certainly not original.  Special effects are good but still not ILM material. But that's just me.

Free Reloaded passes to the new Culver City multi-plex.  The double Enhanced CD soundtrack [bonus feature-laden] which features both the soundtrack with the likes of Rob Zombie, Marilyn Manson, Rage Against the Machine and your assorted one-s*** wonder bands and the score itself by Don Davis with Juno Reactor giving it an Oakenfoldish touch.  The web sites allow the downloading of the numerous TV spots and trailers and four of the Animatrix shorts.  The two most important ones are The Second Renaissance Parts 1 and 2-the rise of the machines and the fall of the human race.  And of course there are the endless überflux of mags with varying `collectable' covers-hence the 4 Premiere Magazine covers.  With all this does that mean that the flick is any good?The Flick:Going into The Matrix Reloaded is simply checking your brain at the door and strapping in.  The Wachowskis spent all their time and energy trying to create a big-time inter-media event with interlocking plot lines with games and cartoons that the movie fails to have any substance.  The heart and soul of the story is lost.  The movie itself feels like a burger in a Burger King combo meal.  No longer do we care about Neo, Morpheus, Trinity or the people of Zion, because they spend so much time orbiting the action, music and special effects.  Whereas in the original film the characters were the kinetic force of the story and made things happen.  Here, things happen to them and they react.  John Gaeta [the special effects dude behind Bullet Time] said many times that The Matrix was a movie that had special effects that supported the story.  A special effect movie with an anti-special effect mentality.  Although there are great FX, but without any warrant to the motivation to Reloaded's narrative or character.And what exactly is the story?  They're given a message by the Oracle to find the Keymaster who has a pass code to a back door program that sends Neo on his way to gaining some unspecified piece of knowledge to save humankind. They go because they must, but they don't know why they're going.  All it leads to is the awesome chases and shoot-outs.  Like a musical where they break out in song and dance, Neo and Company break out in fight and chase. The chases are amazingly well done.  The Mona Lisa Overdrive [the Wachowskis reference to Gibson's novel] is one of the best highway chases since The Road Warrior, Raiders of the Lost Ark, To Live and Die In L.A., The French Connection, Bullit and so on.  The special effects are great [but not groundbreaking] and look really cool doing it.  The fights are more fluid than the original film, but extremely unnecessary.  The fights have lost their sense of urgency.  The Burly Brawl [the 100 Agent Smiths against Neo] is pointless and doesn't do anything but make one laugh at the insanity of the isolated moment.The movie runs two hours and eighteen minutes and in all that time, you get three bits of information that is necessary to understand the plot.  1. The nature and truth about the Oracle.  2.  How Agent Smith finagles himself into Revolutions.  3. Neo's near incoherent purpose to the existence of the Matrix.  The rest of the film references other Matrix-related media types. The Final Flight of the Osiris is mentioned.  But if you played by the rules, the only way you could've learned about the Osiris is to have watched that really bad Stephen King flick The Dreamcatcher.  And the documents that were collected in the beginning of Reloaded could only be understood through the game tie-in Enter the Matrix.  Oh, and the game code to get you infinite ammo is: 1DDF2556.When the flick finally ends, it hasn't.  It ends on a `cliffhanger' style note, but not very cliffhangery because after the end credits there is a teaser for Revolutions that contradicts the Reloaded ending.  And it ends on such a cheesy note that you feel like you're watching a bad episode of the 6 Million Dollar Man-this is the 70's pop equivalent of a bad episode of Dark Angel.What's Missing in the Sequel:When The Matrix opened in April 1999 there was a lot of sociological interest.  The metaphors were subtle enough to suggest that we're all slaves to a larger entity.  That entity being the political structure that dangles our freedom in front of us like a carrot to donkey to pull the cart. Think about that bulls*** job you work and the taxes you pay.  You're easily expendable and can be replaced without a flutter of the eye.  But if everyone rebelled then the machine would crumble.  But fortunately for the machine there's more who are `hopelessly dependent on the Matrix that they are not ready to be unplugged.'  Reloaded attempts to tackle some of the same sociological themes like a `cause and effect' speech where a chick has to suddenly go to the bathroom.  Or the cheating death banter with Agent Smith and Neo just before they start pounding on each other.  It feels more force fed and pretentious.  It doesn't have the natural flow as in the original flick.The Characters:What breaks down to a large disappointment is the lack of character.  Neo is now Superman and can basically do anything which takes the suspense factor out of the fights.  The only time Neo goes into any character twists is near the end when he realizes his place in the Matrix.  Morpheus is more rebellious, dumber and kind of an asshole this time around.  He doesn't really seem to care about anything at all except for his ego.  The only character that seems to open up is Trinity.  She feels more generous and friendly and even gets a little jealous.  The Oracle is broken down into a less enigmatic character as we discover why she knows so much.  And this is a great set-up for a nice little Gumpian chat on a park bench. sandwiched between two fist fights.  Link is the Nebuchadnezzar's new operator who slithers under a subplot concerning the lack of Dozer and Tank and their sister.  Another new character is Niobe who doesn't have much of a part but is spun off from a plot line from the game Enter the Matrix.  All Niobe seems to do is have herself locked into a triangle between Morpheus and or new man, Morpheus' commander.  The Albino Twins don't really do anything but give the special effects crews something to do.  The Agents are bigger, meaner and more relentless than before.  And rogue agent Smith isn't around as much as he should be but it's all setting up his part in Revolutions.The Animatrix:June 3rd The Animatrix DVD comes out.  It's everything The Matrix was and what Reloaded isn't.  It's intellectually and sociologically viable. Nine stories and they all explore the more complex avenues of the Matrix itself like the World Record episode-where only exceptional athletes are aware of the Matrix.  The haunted house dilemma in Beyond.  Or The Second Renaissance where you learn more about the humble origins of the machines and their inevitable conquering of the international market to finance the machine nation Zero One.  It seems like all the really great stories are on The Animatrix DVD.  You would think that all the great stories that the Wachowskis wrote would find their way into Reloaded.  The shorts are directed by the folks that brought you Aeon Flux, Cowboy Bebop, Vampire Hunter D and so on.  Whether or not you dig The Matrix franchise you'd have to admire the generosity of the producers for giving you more bang for your buck.  However, you're still just fueling the machine.Epilogue:In short, this movie is fun.  Not necessarily mathematically intricate or emotionally viable as the original, but fun.  The Matrix raised the bar so high that it's solely competing with itself.  But don't' forget to hang around after the end titles.  There's more Matrix to come.Raging Against the Machines:The Animatrix, Tron, Metropolis, Tetuso the Iron Man, Akira, Hardware, Terminator, Terminator 2: Judgment Day, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines, Cowboy Bebop, Robotech, RoboCop, RoboCop 2, RoboCop 3, Saturn 3, Johnny Mnemonic, The Day the Earth Stood Still, Virtuosity, Ghost in the Shell, Ghost in the Machine, The Lawnmower Man (The Director's Cut), The Lawnmower Man 2, The Running Man, Star Trek: First Contact, Predator, A.

"","","OK. So there is no spoon, but there's not a lot else here either.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0705399/?ref_=tt_urv","Paul-Corio","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2802671/?ref_=tt_urv","25 November 2003","So where to begin? If like me, you are a fan of the original Matrix movie, you will have no doubt felt a rush of blood at the thought of a second and third part of what instantly became one of the best Sci-Fi action films of all time. And why wouldn't you? The Matrix had everything you could wish for in a movie. It was intelligent, cool, sexy, thought provoking, emotive, imaginative, well written and it crossed the commercial divide becoming more than just a flick for hardcore Sci-Fi anoraks, also appealing to a mainstream audience. The Wachowski's had defined the future of fantasy filmmaking and it looked good.
This film concentrates on bringing us up to date with the story, the characters and laying the foundations for the final instalment. Immediately the tone is darker as mankind is now staring directly down the barrel of annihilation. The pace is slower; unfortunately there is no air of mystery to the story. We all know what is going to happen, which turns it into an open book rather than letting the story unfold. This continues throughout Reloaded as the Wachowski's bombard us with scenes that quiet frankly leave you wondering what they are doing in the movie in the first place. There is too much dialogue and philosophical musings about fate, destiny, belief, life, love, death etc. Whilst this is for the most part thought provoking and intelligent, it doesn't really add anything to the story except and prevents the movie building up any kind of tension or urgency in an already plot heavy film.Unfortunately the same is true of the actions scenes, which although visually stunning are too effects driven (yes, there is such as thing). In most cases these scenes are also too long and as spectacular as they are, are overdone. The key performances are solid enough; Reeves has less acting to do in comparison to the first movie but handles the job of fighting a lot while looking cool admirably. Fishburne and Moss do well in further developing their characters and bringing out new dimensions and motivations with credibility. The disappointments here are Weaving and Pinkett-Smith who despite having great acting ability are simply not given enough to do.We end on the cliffhanger TO BE CONCLUDED', which I am afraid cheapened the film for me, making it more TV mini serial than glossy Sci-Fi extravaganza. I assume the third instalment will begin immediately where this leaves off (hopefully without a previously in The Matrix' segment).Although all the familiar Matrix traits are here, (the SFX, the fights and the explosions) Reloaded fails to tap back into the winning formula of it's predecessor or live up to the hype and expectations surrounding it. While there is plenty to see visually the film does not suffer from a lack of, more like too much substance, which will leave many confused.I have no doubt that Reloaded will greatly appeal to hardcore fans of genre eat it up and have them salivating all over their comic books in anticipation of the third film. Unfortunately I think a lot of the intelligence and subtlety the Wachowski's have tried to build into this movie has fallen short of the mark and will be lost and unappreciated by a mainstream movie going public.Truly one of the year's biggest disappointments, but one which will hopefully be redeemed by the concluding part.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The coolest action movie just got better and its worth every bit of the hype. Its got loads of panache. Its got a couple of sequences that is going to take light years for anyone to come close to faking. The movie tends to drag a bit at the start but once it gets to business we know it best for it kicks butts. No one needs to validate the Wachowski brothers' intelligence but they put it to ample use here, be it inserting totally unnecessary scenes e.g. When Neo pays a visit to Oracle he is has to prove that he is the ""one"" by proving his Kung-Fu skills and cleverly cover this up too (Neo:""You could have just asked"") then there is a demo fly to the sky, superman style, which seemed a little out of place; making even the most mediocre situation look spetacular. While the movie has technical aspects and the movie looks miles ahead, the sequences get your heart pounding are: 1. Neo fighting around 100 clones of Agent Smith. Its not like we haven't seen Heroes fend of so many, but the sheer presentation and the Wachowskis signature makes it seem like we've never ever seen anything like this before (nor are we going to see something like this in the near future). The best part is when he swings the Iron staff to fight the multiplying Agents and starts cracking skulls, literally. I think I can still hear the sound reverberating in my mind. 2. The chase on the Freeway as someone pointed out sometime ago, will make Fast and Furious look like a cartoon show. Trinity and Morpheus fight it out with the Twin Ghosts (""programs gone bad"") and the Agents in Car, on Truck tops and then on Bike as they try to snatch the ""keymaker"". Just breathtaking stuff. The Story in a line: Zion, the last city resisting The Matrix is under attack from machines and has 72 hours to fight back, Morpheus and his team must follow the prophecy, get to the core of the Matrix to ""put an end to the war"". The movie was surprisingly easy to follow until Neo encounters the Matrix 'Architect'. From then on it was like someone was trying to explain writing a compiler in 'C'. Got to catch it again. Anyway nothing much in terms of the story content. The ultimate visual treat, but it may not make every Matrix fan happy. As for anyone watching it for the first time, it may not be THAT impressive a movie, taken in total.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

My review for the original gave 9 out of 10. This sequel would not even get 5. The plot is the problem. What happened to the matrix? It was all but forgotten in the sequel and very well could have been any other action movie. What made the original movie unique was pretty much ignored in the sequel. There was a standard chase sequence which went on way, way too long and had no place in a matrix movie, as far as I'm concerned. And why did they feel the need to throw a romance into it? Not every action movie needs to have a romantic relationship just because there are two single available people in it.I can't complain about the acting - they did the best they could with poor material.The special effects were a little too much for my taste. It fell into the trap other sequels, like ""The Mummy Returns"", have fallen into before - because the first movie is a success, they open up the purse strings and end up putting in a bunch of unnecessary special effects just because they can afford to.I disliked this movie so much, I haven't even bothered to see the third one. I suppose I will sooner or later just to see how the whole things ends, but I'm in no hurry to.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Beyond that, the action scenes are some of the best I have ever seen, and may in fact be the best.  But, you are forced to sit through much longer than I think was necessary minutes until the action starts again.  This is a film which really is nothing but a B-Film plot for the purpose of having special effects.  Still I can say that for the most part I enjoyed it, even though the ""ORGY"" scene depiction of Zion also makes you wonder what the purpose of life had become. Is it really better to live inside a Roman Orgy than have a normal life inside the Matrix, even though you are not really living?  However, you are sublimely ignorant of this fact.  What type of food do the humans eat. Now that I reflect on it, I don't recall any of the ""humans"" in and around Zion eating anything.  Go to the market? Sanitation? I don't think so.  Pretty much a mindless vehicle for special effects. Kinda reminds me of ""Independence Day"" in that regards.  Still, I think it was worth seeing for the special effects. How rediculous was the wife of the game-player having to have a kiss, a kiss just like Trinity got? If you want a good plot in films, give it a 3 out of 10.  If you like nothing but special effects, give it 8 out of 10.  Just be aware that you must sit through a whole lot of B-Movie to get to the special effects.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, the story seemed forced and overdone. It felt like EVERYONE in production had an idea for the story, and EVERYONE got their opinions in on the final script.I wasn't sure what this movie was really about. It was about the Matrix, then it really wasn't. It was about Agent Smith, then it wasn't. It was about rouge programs, and then it wasn't. It was about philosophy and the hope that Neo is THE ONE, then it wasn't. Then it was all about NEO's love for Trinity, then it wasn't.I don't understand the point of this movie. Fun action, but even that only looked like a video game. Neo and Smith at many times looked like CGI characters ... which they were. My opinion is, if you can't make it look real, then just work with the real actors. It worked fine in the first one.Plus, what was with the robe wearing idealists known as the Council members, and their hedonisticly and savagely portrayed tunic wearing ""freedom fighters""? I mean, humanity is fighting to do what exactly? Survive to live in a sweaty orgy with no limits? I'd rather stay plugged in myself.Zion looked like a badly dreamt of cartoon world, more abstract and stale than the Matrix itself. I have to admit, the Matrix seems like a much better alternative to the wacky Demolition Man world of Zion. Further, what an insult to make people sit through the longest ending credit sequence in the history of motion pictures just to see a quick and non-engaging trailer for Revolutions.Too many people were involved with this film, and the producers used way too much money on flash and special effects ... I hear they even went over budget and needed Reeves to put up some cash to save it. They could have saved money by cutting their crew in half.Look for it and you'll see a person designated as the Paint Bucket Holder! No kidding! They even listed people in the Accounting Department from some company...I don't know which studio. The sequence was quickly getting out of hand. And, just my opinion, but you don't need 30 assistant directors, and if you do, don't admit it.I pray the next one will be better, but I doubt it. I honestly don't care how this ends.Trinity could have died, and I couldn't have cared less. Neo could fail or succeed, and I couldn't care less. They should have stopped with the first. The story was good, it had a good solid ending. Now, the creators have just made it all a moot point.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But there's a story here, tons of filler in-between the martial arts battles and car chases, and rather than pushing forward the momentum, it actually drags the film down.  Hard to believe a plot about the surviving human race duking it out with their A.I. ""masters"" could turn out so boring, but there you go.When we last left off, Neo (Keanu Reeves) had proven himself to be The One destined to free the human race from the Matrix, an artificial intelligence that has most of the population unknowingly trapped in a dream world.  Those who escaped the fantasy settled to a city called Zion, where they're in preparation for a war against the invading machines.Neo still has his doubts, but none are shared by his lover and companion, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), nor Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), the man who discovered him.  But Neo, curious to discover what further action he should take, heads into the virtual world to search for the Oracle, who tells him to search for the Keymaker.  Meanwhile, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), formerly one of the Matrix's prime enforcers, has become a rogue program, slowly taking over the system with an interesting reproducing technique.For me, the original The Matrix hasn't held up so well over the years.  I still argue that movie failed to achieve its potential, given such a rich and fascinating premise (which wasn't fulfilled here, either)(this series exists for the action, through and through), and its action sequences were somewhat overrated, similar styles having been accomplished (albeit with less slick and polish) from earlier Hong Kong pictures.  That, and Dark City (a movie which The Matrix borrowed from) beat it to the punch with the concept of memory manipulation.But the movie succeeded enough to at least make me look forward to the prospect of a sequel and that's where Reloaded comes in.  And unfortunately, as fun as the plot may sound, too much of it is shaky and pretentious.  That philosophy would be presented as a major theme is not unexpected, but for it to come across as so dull and uninteresting makes its inclusion heavy-handed.  The scene where Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity debate with the Merovingian drags for far too long.  Unless these characters have something truly interesting or vital to say, they should shut up and get moving (in case these people forgot, there is a countdown to the possible destruction of the only remaining human city).Too much of this series is easy to rag on.  In the virtual world, the Zion humans too easily bring attention to themselves with their tight, dark attire and sunglasses.  The Matrix is capable of manipulating the virtual environment (like blocking the exits in a building with brick walls, which is what happened in the original), but rarely does so even when its use would prove helpful in defeating Neo (and such further obstacles would have made the action even more fun).  The film's lead and hero, Neo, is played by Keanu Reeves, whose acting skills are dubious (to be fair, he has improved over the years and it's not as if though co-stars Carrie-Anne Moss and Laurence Fishburne are any better here).But complain as I might, the action saves Reloaded and makes this otherwise strictly mediocre film worth watching.  The most popular setpiece appears to be the highway chase, a fourteen-minute long spectacle that, for the most part, lives up to its reputation.  It's not the best chase ever (Terminator 3 boasted an even more frenetic and exciting setpiece and Raiders of the Lost Ark still has the most rousing on-screen chase), but it is one hell of a thrill ride.  Coupled with the preceding martial arts battle set in the castle, the non-stop fun lasts about twenty minutes. Not since the Indiana Jones trilogy has a movie delivered non-stop creative and thrilling action for such a long period of time (In Raiders, it was the combo of the snake pit, Indy's battle with the giant Nazi, and the truck chase; in Temple of Doom, it was Indy's battle with the Thugee cult, the mine cart chase, and the bridge setpiece; in Last Crusade, the desert shootout and tank chase), though the more recent Terminator 3 definitely has Reloaded beat on all counts.  Best of all is Neo's battle with the Agent Smiths (played deliciously by Hugo Weaving, who remains the most consistent bright spot in the series), who quickly grow in numbers and have our superhero surround from all sides and angles.  The sequence is a total blast and one of the more entertaining fight scenes I've seen all year (though, once again, the Terminator vs. Terminatrix jamboree in T3 has it beat).  All of Reloaded's action put together adds to about thirty or so minutes, not even a fourth of its running time, but the quality of it is enough for me to recommend the film, even if most of the rest of it is a bit of a bore.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The net effect was that I did not feel like demanding my money back.This movie had SO MUCH TO WORK WITH from the original but instead, it decided to do some extacy and masturbate in a cave. This CAVE RAVE SCENE must be the reason for the R rating.  The only foul language is taking God's name in vain and the only extreme violence is blunt instrument trauma the combination of which render the film no more or less offensive than your average episode of ER. They really could have skipped this whole deal and avoided the ""R"" which is sure to hurt them at the box-office. I have NO IDEA WHY they felt this was important to put in the film.Fishburn's ""We Are Still Here"" speech was nearly as idiotic as Steven Seagal's ""Native American Revolution"" speech at the end of On Deadly Ground but, instead of a fat white guy who can't act telling Indians to rise up, it's a fat black guy who can't act telling kids to party. At least Steven had a point. Anyway...The next great scene does not come for a while.  It's almost like the screenplay had a line item that read ""INSERT TWADDLE HERE"". Then, it's Agent Smith-O-Rama.  A fun scene with lots of recognizable martial arts forms (Karate, Kung Fu, Krav Maga...) but the CGI was so punched up that the notion of it having been challenging to film was replaced by the notion of it having been challenging to program.The highway scene could be THE MOST SPECTACULAR SCENE IN ALL MOVIE MAKING HISTORY.  For my money they could have just done THAT for two hours. Really, I do not remember being so captivated by a chase scene since the original Gone in Sixty Seconds. Breathtaking.I was very excited when we finally got to meet the architect.  That is, until he started blathering on about probabilities.  You get the feeling that this guy is counting on your humility... expecting to wear you out with double talk so you will buy into his explanation.To be fair, I did enjoy the film and I will definitely pony up for Matrix III (regurgitated?) but I FEEL SORT-OF CHUMPED.  Since  the second and third installment were filmed at the same time, you can count on the same high quality effects. At the same time, I suspect the story will go just as nowhere.Things to do before the movie... * Go to the bathroom * Lower expectations * Learn French","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But let me say that i have never walked out of a movie so disgusted in my life.  So many people dont realize that it is just bad!  Its horrible movie making as well.  It was especially disapointed because the first movie was SO GOOD!!! The first movie was intelligent and this one was DUMB!!!!  The first one had good action, this one is a bad action movie with boring fight scenes.  The first one had good lines, this one had the most poorely written script ever. The first matrix had original techniques with movie making, this movie was filled with boring, repetetive camera shots.  NOT ONCE did i actually fear that NEO might get defeated and that made it bad.  ANd the rest of the movie was stupid.  THe single good scene was the highway chase scene...the rest was bad.  The fight on top of the truck...BAD.  Zion....DONE HORRIBLY.  A place that has such high technology would not use badly made drums like that. It would be overrun with tecno and s***.  THe Soundtrack WAS HORRIBLE!!!!!  I have to say the scene that defined how bad that movie was, is the scene where he walks into the room and starts randomly fighting the chinese guy. Then he stops and says ""good.  You can never trust someone until you fight them"" or some stupid line like that.  It thus shows that the movie is just a bunch of random stupid fight scenes.  Talk about no plot.  I heard people say how confusing the plot was, but you would have to be blind not to follow that movie.  IT WAS HORRIBLE on SOO MANY LEVELS!!!!!  It was not original at all.

This is not the case with the Matrix reloaded. Unlike other sci-fi sequels of the past (Aliens, Terminator 2)this movie serves as a filler a-la Back to the Future style. It relies heavily on you having seen the first one and really needing to see the third one. This movie tries to play itself off sort of like a TV series and ending abruptly like an episode of the X-files. The special effects are simply CGI effects teams masturbating on film. One fight sequence in particular involves Neo fighting a massive amount of Agents for no other reason than to fight and show off camera work and effects (never once explaining to the audience why he didn't just fly away). The movie suffers for its lack of common sense and inability to stand alone as a movie. Bottom line here is, if a sequel, nevermind how well crafted it is, cannot stand alone as a movie by itself, then it fails no matter how remarkable the visual content is.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Let's Expound On The True Pluses And Minuses Of 'Reloaded'","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0703503/?ref_=tt_urv","Spaniard","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1640894/?ref_=tt_urv","16 May 2003","Zero-in on what's true about 'Reloaded,' even if your truth and mine are inevitably subjective. These truths are addressed in no particular order.The Fights: Astoundingly more elaborate than the first. That does not necessarily make them better. In terms of skill, it's apparent the physicality of the Matrix actors will never truly achieve the agility and power so breathtakingly done in 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and other Yuen Wo Ping-choreographed films. But it doesn't matter if buildup and payoff were more frequently used, as in the scene where they have to get the Keymaster. I hate to say it, but the impressive multiple-Agent Smith sequence could have been trimmed or even cut without appreciable loss of story. (What was it about, cool graphics?) The Keymaster chase, conversely, is almost redemptive in its back-on-track focus on the plot: not only is it eye-popping, it's about these people trying to get away with something, not just fighting for the sake of special effects.The 'Back To The Future II' syndrome: Kenneth Turan rightly says 'Reloaded' suffers from middle syndrome, in that because we know it doesn't end in this one, there's less urgency to tell a complete, self-contained story. It's much safer to pack it with information and lean on the third flick to pull it together. But audiences want more than that. We want 'The Empire Strikes Back,' not the aforementioned Zemeckis film. Of course, that's easier said than done.Unnecessarily Long Or Improperly Placed Sequences: I love the revelry of the Zion celebration - at least, the idea of it. But I don't think it had to be that long, or passionate, unless it came later in the film. Don't you feel you would have enjoyed it more AFTER our heroes survive a scrap, as opposed to before? I've already mentioned the Agent Smith scene. I also believe the opening Trinity sequence robs the action of its power as a foreshadowing piece instead of a complete sequence. Again, don't give us glitz without meaning. Part of the reason 'The Matrix' is so appealing is that the meaning far outweighs the glitz. I think Roger Ebert said it best: the story is far more engaging than the action.The Little Things: I love the part when Neo ministers to followers who desperately believe in him. Or when that guy waxes about wine and the pleasures of swearing in French. The character things, the things that really mean something, come few and far between in the first hour, satisfy us in the second, and make us wonder why we had to sit through half a movie before it decided to get good.So does it mean 'Reloaded' is bad? Not by a long shot. Is it as good as the first? Sorry, not that either. But it does prime you for 'Revolutions.' Let's hope it follows the 'Back To The Future III' syndrome in that it ties things up nicely, making us appreciate the two that came before.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Umm... maybe the filmmakers intended all of this; knowing their target audience, they probably did.  I'm sure that like many modern works of ""art,"" the film contains a lot of clever references and puzzles, but ultimately before you start wading through every scene looking for cookies, you need to ask yourself, ""Is this movie really worth analyzing?""The answer is no.  It has no value because it inspires no feeling.  It is a soulless exercise, and if the viewer doesn't care about what is happening or what is being said, then who cares about cleverness?  The matrix is a hodgepodge of Philip Dick science fiction, Hong Kong action, and philosophy. It borrows the shape of these forms but leaves behind the substance.  It's a cake made entirely of store bought frosting. Keanu Reeves cannot act.  The dialogue is cheesier than the first movie if you can believe it.  The action scenes are completely uninspired and actually boring.  The actors have no grace.  Watch a martial ARTS movie, and you will see people move fluidly, people who have devoted their lives to the study of an art.

The whole point is to turn up at the cinema, pay your dues and be immersed in a universe beyond your experience set - ""to suspend belief"" - if only for a short time and this film does that superbly. It abounds with enough technical wizardry to make Oz look like a cheap parlour trick.The plot (although it helps if you have seen the first film, played the game, watched the 'questionable' animations, read the book, worn the tee-shirt - you get the idea!!) is as easy to follow if you take it in the context of an individual film or as a series. Why people look for and concentrate on flaws rather than enjoy the immersion is beyond me and sounds about as much fun as looking for continuity errors!!You can take or leave the philosophy and those that have taken note of this aspect and slated it as being flawed miss the point entirely. The whole point of philosophy is to take a subject and think inside, outside and beyond the box until every permutation of thought and argument has been explored. Who's to say the roots of this films philosophy are any less valid than Descartes, Aristotle or any other of the great thinkers. And how boring it would be if we all agreed in our philosophical ponderings.So, if like me, you like to stare in amazement at the feats of modern CG and stagecraft and get a kick from trying to figure out the plot before the next twist throws you off track, get your ass down to the cinema, grab some popcorn, pay your money and sit in the semi-darkness until the opening credits start a roller coaster of technically visual mastery....","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So, I entered the theatre for the opening show of Matrix reloaded with much expectations. Most of them were met, some were not. That said, the new installment of the Matrix is worth the wait. If nothing then the ""Burly Brawl"" is worth everything. The machines ARE taking over. I can predict that in 5 years, some games on sony Playstation-X will be enabling gamers ro make moves like what Neo was doing to those 100s of agent smith's. Amazing, the time and the effort that was put into that scene is ground-breaking. Some scenes are out of place, the celebration in Zion and the tea-house confrontation come to mind. The most cereblal moment is the one in which Neo is revealed the true purpose of the One by the architect of the Matrix. I came out in a daze, mostly because of the visual spectacle that these guys have created and in some parts by the sudden unexpected ending. I felt like I had been watching the LOTR part 1.

But I have to admit, I liked this one a little more.  It had more scenes that prompted my jaw to drop (and my jaw doesn't usually drop unless there's a sandwich in front of it).The fight scenes were excellent.  I was glad to see less gunfighting and more fisticuffs.  (What's the use of a gun, if everyone can dodge bullets? That's what really annoyed me about the Matrix.)  Guns are dumb.Monica Bellucci is mind-bendingly knockerific.  She should be in every movie.At the beginning of the movie there is a dorky rave sequence.  During that scene, I was thinking, ""what movie is this?""  It didn't seem to belong. Luckily, however, everyone at the rave is totally hot, so it doesn't matter.Trinity and Morpheus are still unlikeable in my opinion, and if you go to this movie expecting Keanu Reeves to impress you with his acting, well....then I'm sorry.  Furthermore, the script is just about as bad as the first movie's was, loaded with intentionally vague lines like, ""They will find you.  The answer is out there, and it is looking for you.  Follow the white rabbit.  Visit the oracle.  Eat some ham.""

So despite the negative comments you are seeing here, DO go see it, it's well worth it.My only major complaint about it is that to me it felt like the plot was trying to shove too much story into too short a time span. The Link family thing was too brief, the buildup of Neo's and Trin's relationship felt rushed, the purpose of the Smith program now didn't feel explained well enough, the loss of the Zion ships was explained via exposition (I would have loved to see THAT battle scene), even the architect's diatribe at the end felt rushed. I think the Wachowski bros had the right idea, just not enough time in a single movie to get everything in in detail.I'm looking forward to the goofs postings on this one - my chief one is the sunglasses. In the first film when people got clobbered in the face, their glasses broke or flew off. In this one, we're talking a WHOLE lot more fighting (specifically when Neo was kicking Smith booty right and left), and yet I didn't see a single pair of sunglasses go flying.
Now off to the game to see if there's any more detail there.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's that simple.  Unlike the first, ""Reloaded"" uses way too much CGI, taking away the 'real' effect of all the fight scenes from the first.  There are still some fights in ""Reloaded"" that are CGI-less, and they turned out to be the best ones.  Neo (Keannu Reeves) fights the Oracle's (Gloria Foster) bodyguard Seraph (Colin Chou) one-on-one, and that happened to be the best fight scene in the entire film.The fight that everyone was waiting for, the ""Burly Brawl"" (in which Neo takes on dozens of Agent Smiths (Hugo Weaving and a whole lot of stunt doubles) looks to fake.  Neo looks like plastic, and the Smiths look no better.  Also, it goes into too many slow motion shots, causing it to become a little to long-winded.Also, the acting that was almost perfect from the first is taken down a notch in the second.  Even Laurence Fishburne's Morpheus is goofy sometimes. The best performance, again, comes from Weaving as Smith, who in ""Reloaded"" is more sinister and comical than the first.  Weaving uses his eyes to terrify you, the same trick he used in ""The Matrix"".Overall it's a good action movie, still can't wait for ""Revolutions"", 8/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Seeing as how I manage a movie theater, I got the bright idea of not sleeping so I could watch this movie before anyone else could.  BAD IDEA!!!  A few friends and I watched the movie and it sucked, so I thought because I believed the movie was progressing too slow and was too difficult to follow.  However after getting some sleep and watching it again today, I HIGHLY recommend watching this film.  With its breath taking fight and chase scenes, and very complex but ingenious story line which will leave you wanting more.  This film is definitely worth seeing more than once.  There are however, two major things I disagree with in this film.  The first is the five minute sex scene.  I don't believe I was looking to watch a porno when I went to see it which is exactly what it seemed like I was watching. And two it ends with ""TO BE CONCLUDED.""  I know there is going to be a third movie, but come on; we are not watching a sit-com here.

Sprinkled in with this is every martial arts move from the original exploited to the nth degree to the point of absurdity, and way past the cheese point of no return.  And what of Keanu's love interest, Trinity? She looks old enough to be his mom, or eldest sister.  This guy is ""the one"", and could have any virtual, or real, nookie he could dream of.  Yet, he's got to settle for an old butchy looking, leather clad lady who should ""download"" the boob-job program.So yeah, this was not the Matrix II I had been expecting.  While I would not go as far as saying Matrix Unloaded was totally boring, it dragged in many parts, and  was generally inferior in almost every way, save special effects, to the first film.  And all the mumbling and rambling about fate and choice was overkill. Fate, fate, fate, and more discussions of fate. Why don't they just call the film ""The Fate-ridden Matrix""?  And who knew that Zion could be so utterly uninteresting?

In the first one, the rollercoaster that we take with Neo when he realizes all is not as it seems(We're not in Kansas, anymore)seems to make for a better story. The second one is spoilt by this knowledge though there are still some plot twists. It is bogged down by the need to introduce new characters at the start  and to flesh out the existing ones. The obligatory love scene is nothing more than obligatory and could have been left out. And still, the supposed star of the movie, Keanu Reeves, is outshone by Laurence Fishburne and Hugo Weaving. The plot is a bit convoluted and I wished that they had spent more time streamlining the plot to make it more comprehensible. Instead, a lot of time was spent on the incredible action sequences and though they do not detract from the movie, they did steal more time from the plot. In short, the special effects may have made leaps and bounds over the first Matrix, but the plot seems to have taken a back seat.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Slow to start, and with a storyline that reminded me of that philosophical/self questioning tripe that seems to becoming more prevailent in shows like Buffy and Dawsons creek this move is not for anyone who expects a good story. Instead we're thrown a special effects laden clusterf*** with Neo looking cool, Trinity looking sexy and Morpheus talking B*******. For the first 45 minutes the film is as slow as an asmathic snail carrying some heavy shopping, after that it picks up. There are a few fight scenes. But these go on for far too long and seem to have no point. Towards the end the film gets far too cerebral, I thing the brothers are going to just have to accept that not everyone on spaceship earth has a degree in Philosophy/Spirituality/Computing/Middle-Eastern Philosophy. In short this film tries to be an Epic. I sincerely think NOT. In conclusion the dialogue was flat, the acting wooden, and do writers really think that were happy with no ending.

It washed over me and its two-tone look did not pack the razzle dazzle of X2 or Spider-man. I saw this time 2 and I realised the problem. Reloaded and Revolutions (the latter unseen) feel like one movie chopped in half. Expectation is its bane. Never in the Wachow-bros' media history (two quotations so far) have they claimed to be publishing a religious or philosophical gospel for the techno age in The Matrix trilogy. Critics and cultics have done all the talking for them, no doubt to the writers' regret.The ingenious thing about Reloaded is that the two brothers have not retreated further into the boundaries that they set up in the first one. Instead they have burst from them and at the two-thirds mark in the saga we are again wondering where the hell the next part will take us; in a good way. Their biggest achievement is making the audience member both wonder about the ongoing tale and care enough to find out. I always knew it lacked the kiddie appeal to beat Attack of the Clones in america, I was wrong about overseas but in the quality court it is the winner. Clones bores at numerous points and in the end offers no reward, Reloaded leaves many threads to be tied off in Revolutions. Agent Smith, Bane, and the grim future for Zion (the free humans) which seems unavoidable. And they tease the crap out of us with 'The Kid' who features in The Animatrix. What the hell is his story?The Animatrix comes highly recomended if you've seen this movie. But it wont spoil much if you havn't. Either way it expands the universe for you and gives answers that you may have been waiting on. But whatever the verdict on Reloaded, I guaruntee you its not what you expect. The Zion party is the simplest way of demonstrating the human spirit's worth even in the most dismal of circumstances.They have kept the sophistication of Part 1 and start to answer the question posed that may not have occurred to you before-hand. If Neo has all these fantasic abilities within the Matrix, what good does it do him in the real world? The oracle returns breifly to again direct him on his path. There is more fights as anyone with eyes would know but to my disappointment the Agent Smith battle royal comes early in the movie and alas they had nothing up their sleave to raise the bar in the climax. There are some novelty's that they tease us with like Vampires and Werewolves but those confrontations come in the second act and dont really get much air.I'm now primed for 'Finding Nemo' and Joel Silver (Matrix Producer) may have to eat his words; (""nobody can compete with us"") Until Nemo came along though he appeared dead right. But you can quote me on this, The Hulk and Terminator 3 will not be competing in the $270 millions range which the summer gold medal will call for. They will be lucky to beat X2.If you liked the first Matrix enough to be strung along for another 5 months or so then Reloaded will do you good. Still, I will own the trilogy on DVD come summer next year. Moderate your expectation and wonder before watching 'the new matrix movie' what they can thrill you with and what would be incongruous to part I. Great stuff! Go see!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Matrix Reloaded is an action packed visual feast: everything from a delicately filmed 100 agent fight scene to a climactic intense 15 minute freeway chase.  This movie will definitely satisfy most movie-goers and people who loved the Matrix.The plot continues from the first movie, with a darker feel to it. Neo(Keanu Reeves) shows himself to be the one with his amazing fighting abilities.  He gets a boost: he can fly.  Joined with his love, Trinity(Carrie-Anne Moss,) the one who believes in him, Morpheus (Lawrence Fishburne), and the rest of freed mankind, they attempt to stop sentinels from reaching Zion, the last place on Earth.  Morpheus and a few others believe in the power of Neo, others are skeptics.  It naturally follows that there is a struggle between the character and others, namely the commander. Neo also struggles with himself as he tries to hide his awful dream (I won't reveal it here) from himself.  All this happens while the sentinels are digging for Zion and are a matter of days away from reaching the actual city.Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad movie at all.  It's pretty good, just not great.  Where this movie falls short is in it's development.  The story is long and drawn out;  there are many unnecessary scenes, one which is the intimate setting between Reeves and Belluci.  At times it's sort of ludicrous the things Neo can do; you never feel he's in any real danger. But then of course, you're always intent to see what happens next.  Fast forward to the end, and you're left with the feel of Back to the Future. The ending is incomplete and unfulfilled, but most likely because the next in the series will be coming out in November.  If you're looking for character development or a movie that isn't glaring with plot-holes, then this movie isn't for you.

Well, in between more video games and munchies.What is the Matrix? What is the POINT of the Matrix?It is a long tedious load of a**e. Don't look too deep because you may find a few flaws in the story (!).This is boring boring boring. Okay the special effects are great and the film is well made technically. But that is not enough. The acting is wooden. Not surprised with some of the lines they have to spout. The story could be used to strain your spaghetti there are so many holes and flaws and gaps and tosh.Why doesn't one of the frigging agent guys just shoot Morpheus or Trinity? Oh no, we couldn't do that could we? Then we would avoid twenty minutes of tedious fighting where nothing of consequence happens. I know Neo can stop bullets but the other twats can't. Just shoot the numbnuts. And why doesn't Neo just shoot the bad guys? He had plenty of weapons in the first one, but only when they got tired of Kung fu.In fact this film has a lot in common with the TV series Kung Fu. It's full of karate and pathetic philosophical hokem.If I have to listen to more phrophecy rubbish spouted by the pompous, idiotic Fishburne I will have to shoot the f'''cker. In the Matrix or out.And when Neo flies. Perlease!!!!!This ain't superman. Or is it? Well, Superman actually had a plot and believable characters. if you can believe that.Headache material. Smoke another bong and grow up. or at least draw the curtains in your bedroom and experience some reality. Any kind will do. Even another movie. Though not Matrix 1. Otherwise you'll never get out of the matrix and we wouldn't want that. Or would we?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Some spectacular shots of Zion, little else. The rave/sex scene was totally out of place and out of context. Hopefully this will be absent from Revolutions. However, once Agent Smith shows up again and begins cloning himself relentlessly, the film takes off as fast as Neo can fly and for the next hour and a half we are treated to the most impressive, mind-blowing, unbelievable action scenes ever committed to film. I have to give credit to Hugo Weaving, who apparently had the exhausting task of having his performance captured 100 times in 100 different manners to create all the different Smiths. Effects genius John Gaeta has created a cinematic rollercoaster ride unlike anything anyone's ever seen before. And the action would not be complete without kung-fu master Woo Ping Yuen's exquisitely choreographed fisticuffs. I think the Wachowskis, in writing the script, could have done better with the Architect character than to have him spit out a stream of oxymorons that have been thesaurused into words that only a few English-speaking individuals on Earth know.In this case I can't rate the movie as a whole.

The greatest movie in cinematography history. In tortured suspense I awaited the sequel. The movie proved to be an over budgeted CGI disaster. The fight scenes dragged on forever, and the explanations were to far fetched. And I truly believe that they need to take he script and rewrite the dialogue. Some of the worst lines came out of this movie. And another thing, Agent Smith, the ultimate bad ass villain. In the 1st movie, no one could mess w/ him, he kicked everyone's ass. Now hes the comic relief in the movie. Ehhhhh, disappointment after disappointment. As I sat in the theater with my woman we began to tap our fingers out of boredom due to certain scenes. Dont get me wrong, I love the matrix, I love Neo Trinity and the whole bunch, I just cant believe that something so heartless was created w/ The Matrix name attached. To sum this up, The Matrix Reloaded was a let down, lacking the heart and innocence of the 1st installment. If your going as a die hard fan, dont be surprised when your let down. If you go to it thinking your going to see a cool sci-fi movie, then you'll have a better time.I was truly disappointed, and fear what Revolutions will do.......THE MATRIX RELOADED IS A DISEASE, A CANCER OF THIS PLANET......","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The religious metaphors are rather unsubtle and there's a solemnity hanging around the whole film. Lawrence Fishburne reprises his role and impresses. Keanu Reeves is alright. There are two major fight sequences which remain exciting to watch. The film ends without a definite conclusion which may annoy some.

Remember, the reason why the first Matrix is such a great movie is because it introduced us to some ground breaking special effects and an outer this world killer storyline. In Matrix Reloaded we are hit with a continuation of a story line that we know and special effects that we have already seen with a few new ones added. The newness of the whole thing is gone. We can not revisit that. I will admit that when I saw Matrix Reloaded the first time, I was a little disappointed because I did not get that Matrix high. I thought the story line was a little weak. The special effects were incredible. I was very satisfied with my dose of eye candy. As a story, Matrix Reloaded can not stand by itself. I had to remember that this is part two. With the first Matrix having the storyline and this one having the eye candy in over drive, then why not see what would happen if I watched the two back to back. So that is what I did. I watch the Matrix at home and then immediately went out and saw Reloaded. I have to say that I enjoyed it more the second time around. The buzz from the first carried over into the second. As a whole, they fit together nicely as your meat and potato with dessert. Even the too long of a dance scene that could have been left out of Reloaded did not bother me the second time around and start to actually work for me. For those of you Matrix fans that think Matrix Reloaded sucks, try it this way and see what happens. All and all, this is a good addition to the Matrix saga and has its own purpose. The third one will bring this Matrix ride to a fantastic end because now the drama of fighting the machines in the real world will come into play. You all be cool and enjoy. Peace.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The action and special effects sequences are some of the best things I have seen in years. It actually leaves you wanting more, the scene where Neo fights about 200 Agent Smiths is mind tripping, and it makes you think just about any move is possible in this sequence. As far as the story goes and the parts where there was just talking, it seemed at times stupid and insulting. I'd rather not get into it as I will have felt dumber for typing it out. After having examined how the real world is in the city of Zion and the Matrix, well I choose The Matrix, it may not be real, but hey it's all up for debate, which is the only good thing left with this trilogy, which is the simple concept, but in this movie the concept feels a bit stretched out for the sake of it being done, which I felt was dumb.The movie tried to be bad ass when it couldn't, all the flying antics of superman like stuff was even dumber and unoriginal. I look forward to the conclusion in November and I hope it wraps up very well, but don't look for this movie to be the one that rocks this summer. As me and my friends were leaving the theater we went from thinking it was good to slowing thinking it was not so good, which then turned into jokes, but that's another story.Much respect goes out to the special effects crew as they all made it happen. Overall 7/10. Let's see a better concept for the next one and try not to be all Star Wars Prequel like with this.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I mean, come on, all Cadillac's?  Good guys in white, bad guys in black?  Can't we figure it out for ourselves?  I want to know what happened to that 60's-70's jet black Lincoln with the suicide doors.

It's nice to see a huge Hollywood film with big special effects, but also a great deal of substance as far as story is concerned. You don't see that very often with ""blockbuster"" releases. Previous to this film's release the question has always been ""How can they top the first 'Matrix'?"" Bullet-time was a technique that had never been used before until the first ""Matrix"". What on earth could the Wachowski Brothers do to top what they've already pioneered? Unfortunately, they didn't do much. The special effects were all still at the same level as the first ""Matrix"" only this time they were bigger and more mind-blowing. Just imagine bullet-time on a much larger scale. Although nothing new was ""invented"" in this film, the effects were still amazing.""The Matrix"" has always carried a level of cheesiness. This film is no exception. The over-the-top monologues and over-blown musical score may make audience members snicker a bit, but if you've seen the first ""Matrix"", a bit of cheesiness should be expected. A well rounded story with substance should always be appreciated in Hollywood. ""The Matrix: Reloaded"" has a story with a ton of substance. I only question the way in which the Wachowski Brothers communicated that story. In some parts of the film the narrative seems a little detached and unclear. Some movie-goers may easily get lost in the confused way that plot points are presented. To sum it up, if you liked ""The Matrix"" then you will no doubt really enjoy ""The Matrix: Reloaded"". It is a film that aims to please. If you want to see a film you can have fun watching, this is it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The bullet-time squared scenes in the Burly Brawl, for instance, just look about as fake as an arcade game--Neo's skin is completely off; it looks like plastic.  (Shots where all you see are black suits look better.) Final Fantasy characters looked more real.  Again, the scene of Morpheus fighting on the trailer looks incredibly fake in terms of background and location--it doesn't look anything like two guys fighting on a truck moving 60mph on an outdoor highway.  I'm amazed more people haven't focused on this.  It's yet another case of CG work actually moving us back in terms of realism--film-makers try to do too much and then fall on their faces, creating work that seems less real than 70s miniatures.  Spiderman is another example.  If Neo looks all wrong mostly because of his textures (his skin, especially), Spiderman looked fake because of his motions--he twirls around as if the laws of physics don't apply at all.  To me this is a depressing failure on the part of Gaeta and the Brothers--the Bullet time sequences in the original Matrix just look more convincing.  Their backgrounds may have been virtual, but with our attention focused on Neo, it was alright since he looked and was real.  Better luck next time guys.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Even the cinematography reflected this sleek look: the film world was cold, grey, and sleek, very concise, organized. Rather than being led on by multiple plot points and the inner details of character's lives, the viewer of the Matrix was strung along by continuing discovery of the word of the Matrix. It beings an enticing mystery where a character can defy the laws of reality, and the viewer is sucked into this world, wanting to find out its inner workings, which were truly fascinating. But since this world had already been, for the most part, disclosed to the viewer after the first film, Reloaded had to offer the audience something different. In this manner the Wachowski brothers had painted themselves into a corner: having made such a memorable and ground-breaking film, the sequel was obliged to surpass its predecessor. Therefore the cold, focused look of the Matrix had to be lost for Reloaded, at the danger of creating a second film that was much like the original, only with better special effects. The loss of this focus resulted in the scattered nature of Reloaded: the forays into seemingly minor character's personal lives, the seemingly meaningless sex scenes, the introduction of many new characters. One character, however, did succeed for me: the Merovingian. His character was shielded by a veil of mystery about his purpose and motives, mystery that evoked the nature of the first film. I was fascinated by him and his entourage (the twins were wonderful), and how they fit into the greater scheme of the Matrix, while the clichéd writhing sexy dancers of Zion left me bored to tears, just waiting until Neo was plugged in again. The problem with Zion is that the characters and their struggle are both so hackneyed: the shirtless (And somehow all good looking? Living in Zion must come with a free gym membership.) freedom-loving revolutionaries are straight out of the rebels from Star Wars, or any other such movie. I, frankly, don't really give a damn about them. For Chrissake: you know who's going to win! I was angry and disappointed that Reloaded had fallen into these cinematic traps that its predecessor had cunningly avoided. Don't get me wrong: the freeway chase alone is worth the price of admission, and the film does have its saving moments of intellectual curiosities. Though the film will most definitely stimulate your senses, it leaves your mind quite a bit to be desired.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's very dark but that's hardly unusual for a film in the Matrix trilogy, I think if you give it a chance and properly believe you will love it like I do. It's still got Keanu Reeves in it. So I think it's win win! In this film you explore more of the ""real"" world and Tank gets replaced having been killed off, I think his replacement lives up to Tank quite well too. The oracle's performance is great as usual and seems more playful than in the previous film. Gloria Foster does her last job as she dies during filming of the movie. However that does not stop her performance from being excellent. I also found the film far more interesting than the first Matrix film, this is where the action gets going!

It actually made sense for the viewers. Alas, the Wachammacallit Brothers have fallen to their own trap they call a plot. No matter how many times you watch the first intallment, Matrix Reloaded will always seem to be a stand-alone movie- as if it Matrix 1 never happened. With the lack of background, and over-compensation for special effects, one would think that Matrix Reloaded has truly crossed the line for cliched movie making. But wait, it gets worse. The Brothers, with the help of scripwriters thought that it would be much cooler if all the people in the Matrix sounded like they were very intelligent. So as troubleminded as they were, they ended up with characters like the ""Maker of the Matrix"" sound cryptic and Morpheus as the cheesy version of Mandela.Matrix Reloaded should have sticked to its already solid storyline from Matrix. And most importantly, it should have never been an action film that tried to pursue the dramatic flare and the intellectual aspect of the Englsih Patient. An action movie is an action movie... We have yet to see an action movie with a heart.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I liked all of their films... just as how I admired John Woo's films until I saw ""MI:2,"" I was mildly disappointed with the brothers.Just a quick comment to film makers who fancies motorcycles: motorcycles really outperforms any other forms of driving vehicles during a turn.  Riders of sports bike really live for the thrill of putting their knees down while having their bike pitched from side to side at incredible lean angles.  I think there are great potential for breathtaking visuals to film riders breaking hard into a turn, pitching the bike to an extreme lean angle, gassing it sideways to leave the corner while the rear tire leaves a trail of rubber on the asphalt and the front tire in the air... ahh, this is so much better than watching ""biker boys"" weaving between cars going fast and furious.

Most of the scenes were unimaginative and filled with cliches. This movie has everything the fanboys obsess about( the slow-mo scenes, the karate fights, the leather outfits, the explosions, etc) ad nauseum. Needless to say the argument is laughable, there's no character development, and the dialogues between the characters are either confusing, childish or cliche. There is no acting either, is more like spew a few lines and start hitting/shooting/kissing the other actor.Sadly the Matrix saga has turned pop-culture, because this movie and very likely its sequel is your typical ""hero saves damsel in distress while defeating the bad guys in the end"" kind of movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Hey, I'll give the movie plenty of credit for it's action and eye popping special effects.  The biggest disappointment was that the continuation of the story was difficult to follow, I'll have to go and see it again just to try and put it all together. 
To draw a comparison, the two new Star Wars movies copped a lot of criticism, but at least plotwise you knew what has happening and where you were going.

I really feel a bit shamed about registering my thoughts on that - also because pretty much of what I think and love about both movies (the first and Reloaded) was already said by someone, which also shows how effective is the language (the one that you hear and the wordless one, that you read with your eyes) used by the movie. Since everything is more than well said and certainly more then well understood by all watchers and followers of this master piece, I would like to concentrate my comments on its 'Plastic Beauty'. Every scene, every movement, every look and every choreography are as beautiful as if we were staring to a surreal painting for 2 hours. Fights, flies, simple walks, outfits, hair and glasses are like a stroke with a brush. The way the actors (and here it makes no difference if we are talking about real people or virtual images) speak (Smith - slow and paused, Neo - calm and serene, Morpheus on Zion - passioned and strong) or simply move their hand toward some direction are hypnotic, like mixing of colors on a surreal painting. The color black, the crows flying on the fight with the 100 Smiths, the music that follows us until the end, the  rhythm and the cadence of the script are the atmosphere that, with no coincidence, makes your mind free. No scene is 'ok' - they are all great! No scene should have been cut off - they are all important and essential to form the Matrix Ballet which is, besides the needing of understanding the story the best way I can (even though I am a Matrix article buster...), the reason that will take me back to the movies.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I loved the first one but I never felt it really needed a sequel. After hearing some negative words about it, and fewer positive, I lowered my expectations and went to watch it. But as it turned out, my expectiations were still too high!This is not a great movie at all. In fact, the first half is really terrible, with that stupid caveman-dance and all the uninteresting relationships, I was bored-- which is not a good thing for a Matrix film.Then there was a highlight, the (clearly cgi'ed, but very entertaining) fight between Neo and the agent Smith clones. I was glad the Wachowski's dragged Smith back into the story, for he was one of the best things in the film, although I wondered when he would go and wink at the camera. Then there was the fight on the stairs and the freeway chase, both were nice but never as ground-breaking as they should have been. I liked the twins, although I found the way Morpheus beat them plain stupid and illogical. But none of those scenes really made up for the truly pathetic first half of the movie. Zion is truly the worst idea since George Lucas decided to put Ewoks in Return of the Jedi. I also found Morpheus completely disappointing, all he did was mumble incomprehensible quasi-wisdoms and walk around with his hands on his back. Carrie-Anne Moss was great as Trinity, but it says something of a film when Keanu Reeves is one of the best things in it.But then there was the finale. I presume the Wachowski's have edited this on a Hi-8 camera or with (as Leonard Maltin once said) a chainsaw. It was a mess. A horrible, mess. First I thought it was a trailer for the third film, but suddenly a power-plant was blown up and there was an architect who should have said memorable things like ""there is no spoon"", but Andy and Larry apparently ran out of inspiration.Watching the Matrix Reloaded made me wonder. Did they spend all their money on the freeway-chase, and then realise that they had to make a film? The effects were sometimes hilariously bad, the dialogue was sub-Phantom Menace, the editing was amateur-ish. While there should have been new, memorable characters (see Lando and Boba Fett in Empire Strikes Back or Gollum in the Two Towers), there were uninspired people where you just couldn't care less about.This was a disappointment and Revolutions has to do a lot to make up for this.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Beyond spectacular, matriculating sci-fi thriller","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704906/?ref_=tt_urv","Neoromeo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0487233/?ref_=tt_urv","12 June 2003","Embarrassing as it is for me to admit it, 1999's ""The Matrix"" was what first got me interested in dissecting and interpreting literature. I was in grade 9 at the time, so I can be forgiven. Needless to say, though, that with the cliffhanger ending of the first film, a brilliant marketing campaign, and a well-promoted anime build up, ""The Animatrix,"" ""Reloaded"" became a film I anticipated more than any other for about three years. And now that I've seen it, twice (once sober, once not) I don't know if I can say I'm disappointed, but something didn't quite do it for me.The second film picks up where the Animatrix episodes ""Final Flight of the Osiris"" and ""Kid's Story"" left off, with a warning that's been sent out to the human race that 250,000 sentinels are tunnelling their way into Zion, and will reach the city within 72 hours. In the meantime, Neo (Keanu Reeves) is struggling with a disturbing dream, in which Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) suffers a dark fate. The ensuing crisis forces the Nebuchadnezzar, with new operator Link (Harold Perrineau), to return to Zion, and bring Neo before his people for the first time. He is still struggling with his status as the One, unsure of what his function is.When the crew has returned to Zion for humanity to hear the news and to celebrate, Neo discovers the Moses-like appeal that Morpheus has to his people, standing on a rock and bellowing to the remainder of humanity, ""WE ARE NOT AFRAID!"" after which the population moves into a percussion-driven rave to celebrate that they are all still alive. During this time, Neo sees the people have enough faith in themselves, and makes love to Trinity away from prying eyes. The rave scene was panned by most critics and viewers - I thought it was excellent, using an excellent selection by Fluke to drive the scene, and capturing the essence of what a rave truly is: a celebration of life and love, the two factors that are keeping humanity in existence. This scene perfectly encompassed the love humans hold for each other, as well as showing hope as the species' greatest strength.From there, however, it's time to get down to business. Neo and the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar leave Zion to find a way to stop these machines, and so they enter the Matrix. Neo goes to see the Oracle, who explains to him that he must find the Keymaker (Randall Duk Kim) who will lead him to the Source, where all questions will be answered, and Neo will be revealed his destiny. To get the Keymaker, Neo must go past the Merovingian (Lambert Wilson), who's guarding the important figure for his own benefit. Soon after, however, Neo is confronted by a newly-resurrected Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who found a way to survive his destruction in the first film, and to make things more complicated, he found a way to copy himself. So now, as Neo says, there are more Agent Smiths... ""a lot more.""Through a series of elaborate fights and obstacles, Neo struggles to find the Keymaker so he can truly learn his place in the world. He does not yet know whether he's supposed to save anyone, but his answers lie at the Source, where he encounters the Architect (Helmut Bakaitis), the creator and conceiver of the Matrix. The man speaks in elaborate computer and mathematical language, so that only Neo can understand what he's saying, though I'm sure even he had some trouble figuring it all out. The film leaves the audience with a number of questions: why is Neo here? What is his true purpose? How can Smith copy himself? Why, in God's name, couldn't the Architect have avoided using numbers and integers to speak when English would have done just fine? (Maybe because he's a machine... dumbass)""The Matrix Reloaded"" functions as a sort of religious, mythological and philosophical lesson for a 21st Century used to special effects, techno music and kung fu action. This film tries to capitalize on its predecessor in every way, so that in the end it is stretched out to over two hours and forces its audiences to see it again to catch everything. That would be impossible for one person to understand every aspect of the film, for it is equal parts Christianity, Greek mythology, Zen buddhism, Platonic thought, computer technology, martial arts, and several other factors I've missed completely. The film might often be passed of as being too complicated, taking itself too seriously, and poorly outlined, all of which are true. However, in the case of this film, it can almost be forgiven - the sheer quality of the filmmaking and the special effects is so flawless in some scenes you'll forget anything else entirely.Certain parts of the film are unfairly criticized, namely, the fight with the army of Agent Smiths. Most audience members have asked, ""how come Neo didn't fly away earlier, like he did at the end of the scene?"" Well, like the Oracle said, what kind of a One would he be? Neo's got a huge burden on his hands - he's supposed to be the savior of mankind, and if he's going to immediately run away from a fight with the beings he's supposed to defeat, well, who are they putting their faith in? Despite the fight scene dragging on a little long, it provides a chance for viewers to see some spectacular animation in action, not to mention an overload of spectacularly-choreographed fighting.The greatest strengths of the film lie in its effects, its cinematography (though diminished from the quality of the first film), the music (assigning techno group Juno Reactor to remix Don Davis' score was a stroke of genius) and its willingness to entice its audience to think. Not to mention it leaves the audience, again, with a cliffhanger, eagerly anticipating ""The Matrix Revolutions"", due out in November. The final film gives the filmmakers a chance to put everything together - and they better do it right, or the Wachowskis will go down in film history as a filmmaking team that caves in under its own material. 3 stars on a five star scale.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Disappointing","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704133/?ref_=tt_urv","Elektrum","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1692682/?ref_=tt_urv","21 May 2003","The first Matrix film was successful; it was even good. The plot was interesting, though the on-screen events were focused. We heard of a place called Zion, though we never got to see it. Good. Great. We (guys) all wanted to see Neo dodge bullets inside the Matrix, and our girlfriends shed a warm tear at Trinity's (ho ho) life-saving kiss. What a delicate balance.But now The Matrix is a trilogy, so a new formula needs to be followed: Take the first movie, identify important aspects of the plot (The oracle, Zion, the charismatic Agent Smith) and expand them. Now we have The Matrix meets Star Wars in film #2, as we get to see the unimaginatively-displayed Zion, which is capable of fending off diabolical machines and manning advanced ships. When it comes to providing running water and clothes-that-arent-tattered for its inhabitants, however, it seems that Zion is direly lacking in resources. Oh well, it's aesthetically intuitive right?We also get an extremely uninteresting glimpse of a tangential character's (love) life. Since most of the Nebuchadnezzar crew in film one did not make it to the sequel, we have this new fellow who pilots the ship. His girlfriend/wife doesn't want him to die (strange), and so she cries on camera for us. I'm pretty sure we don't care. This is The Matrix 2, and it's difficult enough to deal with Neo and Trinity's contrived 'magnetism', yet now we are supposed to digest this unintroduced character's dealings with mortality in a post-apocalyptic world?As I mentioned, there are some hideous Star Wars elements in The Matrix: Reloaded. For example, we are forced to learn that there are disagreements among the humans at Zion, and that the counsel folks wear robes and appear old and wise (though they can't pull jedi tricks on you... unless if you meet 'em in the Matrix). These politics are severely boring due to poor acting and dialogue. Even Morpheus is to blame, although his speechwriter for the rave scene deserves most of the corporal punishment.Have I mentioned that the movie was a video game during most of the fight scenes? ""Keanu Reeves"" was inadequately represented by some computer model.How many Agent Smiths does Neo fight in The Matrix? One. What is more than one? A lot. And that's how many Agent Smiths Neo fights in The Matrix: Reloaded.Now, before I relax, allow me to note that the attempts at philosophical profundity in The Matrix: Reloaded are a slap in the face for any individual with a partially-functional brain. Determinism is a fine concept for a movie, yet it is severely out of place in this film (esp. in the Neo & Oracle conversation). The matter of Free Will is superficially addressed, and if you pay attention, and do not simply assume that the scriptwriters know what they're doing, then you may become sadly amused during this scene. Now, if the rest of the movie were any good (including the fight scenes), then I would shut my brain off during the Philosophy bubble-gum parts and the part where Neo shoves his arm into Trinity's chest to rip out a small bullet from her heart (""WHOA, what's this bullet doin here?"", ""I KNOW FIRST AID KUNG FU"", etc.).But, nah. The movie contains very few tolerable scenes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Form over Function!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704646/?ref_=tt_urv","aliciadipesto","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2141641/?ref_=tt_urv","28 May 2003","This film is dividing opinion. There are those who will embrace it, greeting Neo and Trinity like old friends, throwing themselves geekily and wholeheartedly into the next exhilarating adventure, sharing the thrill of the continuity error in chatrooms everywhere, and there are those who will stumble out of the cinema, blinkingly into the sunshine, wondering what just happened.I tried to like it, honest I did. I would normally elaborate on the plot at this point, give you a rough outline of the story, but it was just so complicated that I really can't begin to tell you anything of any substance. It's a glossy good against evil flick really, with some hi-tech philosophy thrown in for good measure, but I can't provide much detail I'm afraid. My impressions of the first Matrix weren't that original; I was similarly blown away by the special effects but I had to be reminded of the story on the way into the cinema, which isn't a the best way to see a sequel, never mind review it. But that's the point - if the film contained anything worth remembering other than the effects, I wouldn't need a reminder.
However, it's the effects you come to see, and I would recommend seeing them on celluloid with the requisite surround-sound to reap the full benefits of the latest developments in CGI. There are whole sequences where the actors are not just flinging themselves around in front of a blue-screen, they aren't even there - Keanu takes on hundreds of smarmy Hugo Weavings single-handedly but barely breaks a sweat - even his facial expressions have been painstakingly computer generated. The film-makers were keen to offer the audience more than just a load of bullet-time sequences that made the first movie famous, apparently. This is a refreshing change from the increasingly lazy use of CGI to provide backgrounds of thousands of people marching, fighting, dying etc. as we've seen and yawned at in The Mummy Returns and Starship Troopers as  earlier examples, and even the latest Lord of the Rings relied heavily on this kind of technique.
The freeway scene is a CGI masterpiece from beginning to nail-biting, climactic end and even though by now I was hopelessly confused, I was on the edge of my seat willing the enigmatic Fishburne to rescue the humble keymaker - from what, though? I couldn't tell you.The film suffers from an over-complicated plot, laboriously explained in unnecessary depth by a number of predictably bizarre characters. Once I'd been nudged awake, I learned that one of these actors had actually died before the sequel could be made, so clearly the film makers have gone to enormous lengths to create her image with the aid of a computer and a lot of old footage. I'd almost have appreciated a small footnote at ths point in the movie explaining this as it would have made it worth watching.
The Matrix Reloaded is ultimately a lavish creation of form over function, and no matter how impressive the effects are, and they are jaw-droppingly, breathtakingly awesome at times, there is little of the kind of magic other sci-fi classics such as Star Wars that makes you care about what happens to the characters. The relationship between the expressionless, comatose Neo and the taut, fraught, angular Trinity is intended to be passionate but the acting is so wooden and contrived that it's just not very credible. I ended up watching her frown lines grow deeper as the film wore on, not worrying particularly whether their love would survive. But who cares? The effects will keep you going.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I, myself, waited until the 17th to see the movie, allowing time to see reviews such as the ones published on this site to make a final decision to see the movie.  After seeing even the national newspapers turn their noses up at Reloaded, I just had to see if it really was that bad.After having seen the movie, I can't help but disagree with the 75 percent of you people who are discouraged from this movie.  Yes, it was different from the original Matrix.  Yes, the special effects are a little more fast-paced than the original.  Yes, the martial arts sequences in this movie are a little less kung-fu than the original.  I agree to these three things. I do not fully understand why Woo-ping Yuen's choreography this time was a little less Hong-Kong and a little more American.  What I do understand is that there really IS a plot in this film, and while the action sequences may cover it up, the idea of fate vs free will is still as strong in Matrix Reloaded as it was in its original.  Choice is key in this new installment and considering Neo is given a choice between the ultimately destructive or the ultimately creative, he is still given that choice and takes it freely (for more info, see the movie or check out the philosophy section of the official Matrix website).I advise those of you who were disappointed with your inital viewing of Matrix Reloaded to watch it again and see the movie for what it really is, not what you wanted it to be.  I have seen many people I spend my day with do such and have been made content with the way this movie plays out. Also, remember this movie is the MIDDLE installment of a trilogy and, being such, is subject to being a little less conclusive than most viewers would want or expect.  Catch the movie again, you might just change your mind.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'll discuss my initial impression. To begin with, it was good to see Morpheous, Neo and Trinity back. Jada as Niobe did a fantastic job,and it was great seeing the Oracle one last time,RIP. And I can't forget Agent Smith or Smiths.Let me just say that the costume design was off the hook. Give me the Latex dress or Keanu's suit. But it was like that in the first Matrix too. We are introduced to new characters and the ones I found that were impressive were the blond dread-locked twins. They were invincible, immaculate you could say.
And now the best part that deserves a paragraph of its own. The special effects. Yes it was animated but worth a view. The action fight scenes were excellent. Like I said visually stunning. Keanu did such a good job in making it look effortless and look DAMN good doing it. It was choreographed to perfection. And everybody had their ten minutes to show their moves as well. Morpheous and the sword scene. Morpheous and the car scene, it was constricted but cool. The agents, they got a serious upgrade. Carrie Moss did a great job with her motorcycle scene. She can hold her own. Say the female version of Neo only not the One. And now the unfortunate part. I didn't care for the life of Zion that they showed in the first act. A little too far-fetched and imaginative. Too forced too brief. There is alot to take in. You either feel it or you don't.I thought the love scene was very respectful and PG compared to the porn they practically show on regular TV. But like I said, all too quick to take in. Story was off-base to me. Too brief with the plot development.The first Matrix was just so fresh and energetic and new. You could take all the movie in with the first or second viewing. I think the W brothers lost their focus from the initial story, or maybe it needs a second viewing. And by the time the story got to the architect, it just felt like a head trip. If they wanted to go somewhere with this, it should be made into a television series. Not a trilogy or a movie. Its not going to be complete with a trilogy. A story as complex as the Matrix continues. And yet I'm hungry enough for the Revolution and to see Keanu in that DAMN suit.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Those who hate it, just didn't like it.  And those who liked it, liked it.  I know people who hated the godfather, but can be recognized as one of the best films of all time.
And why do so many people judge these movies based on the idea that they are seperate entities like a stupid friday the 13th movie, I mean common, I think personally, they all should have been showed as one big movie.
I actually did what I thought to be the best thing as in waited till revolutions came out as a rental, watched the movie at my house, then went to the movies to watch the last part.....And it was perfect.The main point of all three movies was that Zion and the remaining humans left in the future (or the real time) were to see the end of the war, which happened, end of story....Neo did his job well.........And if you are wrapped up on the idea that another war is going to start soon again, that is not what it said, but it is possible that another war might start up again....But isn't that incredibly realistic?  After all in human existence, there are hundreds of wars.Stop thinking so hard people who hated the movie.....It's a story about love, a story about loyalty, a story about hope of survival, and so many other lessons, which I think we can all agree, that our history of the human race has all excerised to become the world in which we are today.
I think if it were looked upon in a grander scale instead of just another friday night movie, it would make more sense....Seeing the true life lessons in which this movie so accurately and elequently depicted, is what I found to be the best part of the movie.

You NEED to have seen the first, there's nothing to remind you of what is what, and it ends forcing you to see the third to get any semblance of a satisfactory conclusion.And don't even get me started on the porn rave at the beginning.  Talk about not following up your opening with anything interesting.  I was hopeful that because they were getting the lovescene done so early that it would allow the rest to be unimpeeded, but alas...Essentially, the characters don't understand what's going on until 2 hours in.  They are told this numerous times.  They admit to this.  Yet still do it unquestioningly.  Naturally, the audience is even MORE lost.  This is bad filmmaking.Phantom Menace has some cool bits that are DEFINITELY worth rewatching, but on the whole was bad.  Matrix Reloaded is the same.  Essentially Revolutions will pick up and be the movie Reloaded should have been from what I can tell so far, which is just bad storytelling too.Oh yeah.  The core themes were blunt as hell, but themes do not make a plot. The fanboys saying ""You need to see Revolutions too"" don't understand... this film simply cannot stand on its own two legs, which hampers it indefinitely.  Is it meant to?  Not entirely, but neither was Two Towers and it did it without problem.Oh yeah, CGI, the bane of movies lately...  flailing characters that move too fluidly and effects that could have been a simple bluesceen wireshot done with CGI.

A very lush, complex, beautiful music video, but still a video.  I suppose that description is not totally accurate because Reloaded is overall a very good movie and well worth the price of admission.Where as the first Matrix had a great story and some awesome effects, Reloaded piled on the visual effects and continued the story from the first movie without a lot of surprises.  It would be hard to top the storyline from the original Matrix, and it appears the filmakers didn't attempt to do so, opting instead to develop the love story between Neo and Trinity and further explore Neo's development as ""The One"".One thing did bother me about Reloaded:  The ending was a bit of a disappointment that left me feeling the movie was little more than an episode.  The final tagline ""To Be Concluded"" seemed an admission by the producers that that is what they either intended or settled for.  Some sequels are successful in standing on their own and do so beautifully. See ""Terminator 2"".  Some settle for the episodic ending.  See ""The Empire Strikes Back"". and now The Matrix 2.Still, maybe this is all in the plan.

This movie was better then the revolutions though. I think the trilogy would've been better if they knew it was going to be a trilogy when they made the first one.

His facial expression was great and he worked well with the diolouge.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

My younger sibling is big into the whole anime scene, and said that this movie (even more so than the first) follows very strongly the nature of much anime - lots of cool fight scenes, with philosophical pondering in between.I felt that a few scenes were a bit drawn out (such as the rave/sex orgy that went forever long, and had absolutely no point other than further attracting male viewers).  And it lacks the full depth and spontaneity of the first movie.  But I liked it, and I think the plot went well, when they got around to advancing it.I'm curious to look up the original manga series after the third movie is out, as well as the Animatrix - a 10-part anime prequel to the movies, done by the same brothers.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

He should have flown up, hollered something ecstatic and then whooped on his way. Instead he acts as if flying is one more gritty chore he must endure.Then there is the attitude toward women. Link enters his abode hollering ""Where's my pussy""? and he is talking about his wife?! In most households I know of, Mr. Link would have been relegated to the doghouse until he learned some manners. Then the way that capt. says ""Niobe"" as she talks to her former flame, Morpheus. It is in such a way that he is demanding she come to him... and she does! Are they telling us that in this hardscrabble future, where women risk their lives just as much as men, that the men are really only chauvinistic pigs? Well, no. White women fare better in the film, so I must conclude they are catering to prevailing stereotypes. (In this alternate universe there should be no notion of prejudice as a battery is a battery is a battery, regardless of outer casing.) Why does it always seem I'm the only reviewer who ever speaks up against violence toward women, nasty stereotypes and inappropriate behavior (in so-called children's films) that Hollywood keeps feeding us? The dialogue is ponderous; the love scene between Neo and Trinity fell surprisingly flat (no chemistry whatsoever!), and Morpheus' speech was too pompous for all the dancing that followed.The first Matrix film stood on its own two feet. This one can't because they gave it no ""mini-ending"" to tide one over until the next film came along. The desire to milk more money from the viewing public (or to copy the Lord Of The Rings in its epic three picture deal, which is more believable when one realizes Hugo Weaving was in both trilogies.) is too obvious for taste.Will I see #3? I will, but not in the high dollar theatre... or even in the expensive ""one night rental"" for new releases. No, I'll wait, just like I did for this one, until it goes into the bargain rental bin.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I can list reason after reason, and the Reloaded fans of the world aren't going to care less. Keanu could spend the 138 minutes reading the newspaper (He's kinda slow...) and these people would still rave about it.This movie should have tanked big time, but sadly the fans don't care about quality. The acting is horrible, the CG is embarrassingly bad, and the story is mindless psychobabble. Folks, this is NOT deep thought. This is meaningless babble designed to make the easily impressed think they said something smart. If you haven't figured it out yet folks, they're pulling the story out of their hat as they go along. (Hat in the G rated version...)The movie does manage to have one or two amusing scenes, but they are far, far overshadowed by the horrible ones. There's a incredibly long rave scene that is just beyond lame. The whole Zion scene, which is the first half of the movie, is just pathetic. Sadly, even the scenes that are amusing go on to the point where they become a bore.

But beyond that the story extends what we already know about the Matrix and to a certain extent plays with it's own rules which makes it all at once the same and yet a different film to the first.The fight scenes are awesome. If Keanu was a dabbler in the martial arts in the first film he's a true master in this. The bad guys really are trying to stick sharp unnatural things in him - how did they make it look so real? You can seeKeanu's effort and concentration sometimes, and this is Mr Reeves we're talking about, Mr Keanu critic, so is he acting it?The central trio of Neo, Morpheus and Trinity are given more room to breathe, and I think make for an interesting dynamic. Hugo Weaving as Smith must havehad a blast shooting his scenes, and it's great to see the script stay on the right side of parodying itself before anyone else does. It also is unashamed in it's celebration of itself - at a point where some key characters are saved byanother, I wanted to holler out ""YES!"" at the top of my lungs, but my British reserve prevented me. Luckily another character in the film did it for me - cheers Link.This is not to say the film does not have it's small flaws. Most disturbing are two scenes of plain old weirdness, which to my mind are the Wachowski's ""adultManga"" sessions coming through - or it's my British reserve making me feeluncomfortable. Also a key conversation towards the end of the film is so loaded with references to everything that the Matrix is, was and will ever be is just to much for my brain to take in in one sitting, so I need to go and see it again.I just need some water to help the pill go down, that's all. Wait a sec, the bottle says that adults should take two red. Maybe I'll have three. Just to be sure.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This 2+ hour borefest was worse than my high school geometry class. The acting is so robotic and dorky that I was embarrassed for the actors in the movie. The stupid array of names- Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, made this movie ridiculously stupid. Also, the whole plot to this Matrix story is boring and completely uninteresting. I no longer care about Neo finding his way through the matrix. He's THE CHOSEN ONE! All Hail Neo! ...so what!?! Stupid story, boring action, I recommend watching the trailer a few times.

First of all, the most interesting thing about the Matrix world in general is infact the Matrix itself. So much of this is set in Zion which makes the film, (a quote from my gf): 'JUST TOO DARN SCI-FI!!!' And although I like the sci-fi genre, I'd have to agree. Its just a pretty average 0'ties action/future flick. Oh, and the end makes it feel like an episode of Buffy!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Given, you felt at times like you were watching a video game (I kept leaning over to my wife and mentioning that we were all of a sudden in a CGI world).  The philosophy at the heart of this trilogy is what is making it the most fun for me.  I love the fact that I spent three days after I saw Reloaded trying to figure out what the hell just happened.  Many say this film has no value-but I think much like the Lord of the Rings trilogy,(when the Two Towers was 3 hours of straight war) the second film is filler between the two much more important beginning and end.I highly suggest this great film for Matrix and Action fans.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The original film introduced us to the mind-blowing martial arts fighting techniques which were previously unknown here in the USA (unless you watched a lot of imported Hong Kong flicks) and also used special effects which had never been seen or even attempted. Now, however, the ""Matrix-style"" fight scenes are used in almost every TV show and film, and the special effects just aren't so special anymore.  In the original, a five-minute fight scene had the audience riveted.  In the sequel, a similar 20-minute fight scene had me yawning before it was halfway over.  I also found myself yawning whenever one of the charcters stopped fighting long enough to give one of the many long, drawn-out, psuedo-philosophical speeches which littered the film.  These were all delivered in the soft, slow voice that grandpas use when reading to little kids before bed, and they had roughly the same effect on the audience.  In a nutshell, this is a film about people in sunglasses acting cool.  The people who think the ""message"" in this movie is deep are folks who have probably never even been in the same room as an actual philosophy book.  The special effects will have most 13-year-olds praising this as the greatest accomplishment in the history of cinema.  The rest of us will just consider it to be two hours of halfway decent entertainment and nothing more.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I didn't grasp any chemistry between the two. Yes, there was sexual passion...but so..where was the deeper meaning of the relationship? All I could get out of it was that they liked to have sex when they could. Shallow. The action scenes began to wear on me. They just went on and on. After the first four minutes- I got the point of the conflict! Get to the end, already! I noticed alot of very young kids in the the theater, anywhere from five years old to teens. I just shook my head. There was some tough language and sensuality that was not appropriate for a child. Oh, let me guess...my standards are too high.

The screenplay was excellent, and the acting was superb. I thought the directors couldn't wow us again after THE MATRIX was released but I was so wrong. Keanu Reeves gives an excellent performance again as Neo, the office boy who hacked into THE MATRIX in the first movie. Scary in places (I was a little concerned after seeing the dreadlocked twins turn transparent!), funny in places (but the one liners those twins delivered were pretty good) and just plain brilliant in places (the car chase), overall, I give THE MATRIX: RELOADED 11 out of 10. At times I tried to predict what was going to happen, but, like the first movie, I was stunned beyond belief. Nothing was predictable about this movie. I also liked the ending. Many people I know disliked the end because it didn't answer any questions. Was the creator of THE MATRIX telling the truth? Was he really the creator? Was Morpheus right all along with his predictions and prophecies? Was the Oracle all she was cracked up to be? So many questions, not enough answers.

"","","Too much CGI","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704963/?ref_=tt_urv","BSchin2188","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1831746/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2003","This was pretty good, about equal to the sequel.  The only real problem was that it was way too much CGI.  Computer animation isn't to the point where it looks spectacular, just like real life.  It will be a long time before it does.  The Wachowski brothers decided not to care, and filmed a large fight scene with 90% CGI.  The result, a STUPID, god awful fight scene.  I'm referring here to the ""Neo vs. 100 Agent Smiths"" part.  At first, it was really, really cool.  REAL people actually fighting, good choreography and lots of martial arts.  That impresses me.  Computer animation doesn't.  When Neo starts flying around, he looks like a cartoon.  When he starts running on a pole in a circle, kicking all the agents, he looks like a cartoon.  If they could have done this with REAL people, it would have looked 100% better, and been 100% more impressive.Of course, whenever I voice this opinion, everyone says I have budget envy. At this point, I'd like to point out that ""Enter the Dragon"" didn't cost nearly this much to make, and it is three times better then this will ever dream of being.  Besides, low budget movies are the best anyways.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","A very good movie plus bonus crap","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0703616/?ref_=tt_urv","suntzu212","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2418099/?ref_=tt_urv","16 May 2003","This was a very good movie.  It is well worth the money to see it in the theatre.  You most likely will enjoy it and appreciate the progression of The Matrix storyline.Sadly, not quite as good as the first one, but without the ""shock value"" of the original, there is no way it could be as good.  There are some parts of this movie that I just plain didn't like.  But instead of taking it out on the movie as a whole, I'd prefer to think that this was a very good 1.75 hour-long movie with a half hour of crap mixed in thoughout.  The action scenes are terrific; some of the slower scenes are very interesting, but other scenes are mostly worthless.  Here's my advice if you are seeing this movie -- if you find yourself being bored in a scene, go take a bathroom break because the boredom will continue for another 5-10 minutes.  You won't even miss anything important to the story.I also have a beef with the ending of the movie.  At the end, Neo does something that should be completely mindblowing, but the event was played down and then we saw a confusing 5 minutes of dialogue followed by a cheesy horror film ending.  I would have preferred to see Neo's action played up a bit more and then have the movie end right after that.  I think that would really leave people guessing and wanting to see the conclusion.There were several great things about this movie.  I could go on all day about the action scenes and special effects, but I'm sure you've heard it all.  Also, there were several new things that were introduced in this movie that really gave breadth to the story and the environment.  Finally, though the movie was trying way too hard to philosophize, there were a couple of things that really made me think about my reality.So to sum up, don't expect the same kind of ground-breaking and thought-provoking movie as the original.  Expect a big budget action fest that also has an interesting story and a few slow parts and you will greatly enjoy this movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Was I blown away or did I just see an exaggerated version of the first Matrix? The movie had too much padding (the overextended scenes at Zion during the celebration and Neo/Trinity's love scene) and so much philosophical mumbo jumbo throughout that it started to concern me where the 150 million dollar budget went to. But then the action sequences started kicking in, and after all was said and done, all I wanted to do was to go home and watch the original Matrix so I could be blown away by its audacity and originality, something I hoped this overblown, over-budgeted sequel would do. Probably they are saving the real razzle-dazzle for ""Revolutions"". We shall see.P.S. IMDB users, please do a spell check before posting your comments.

"","","The Matrix Retarded (spoilers)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1232164/?ref_=tt_urv","Ricky_Roma__","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5767111/?ref_=tt_urv","1 December 2005","The second instalment of the Matrix trilogy takes all the excitement and energy of the first and flushes it completely down the toilet. In its place you're given turgid politics, ludicrous amounts of pseudo-philosophy and an unconvincing romance. It finally becomes clear that the Matrix has disappeared up the Wachowskis' arses.But what's most criminal of all is that the action is dull. After all, I'm not one of these sad teenagers that give a damn above the 'mythology' of The Matrix or the crappy philosophy. I have no desire to dress up like a knob and wear sunglasses indoors while practising bedroom kung fu. All I want is a decent story and some decent action. But instead you get a moronic story and lacklustre action.The most hyped piece of action is the car chase. Supposedly it was going to be the best car chase of all-time. It was going to change our attitude to cinema. Instead what you get is a bit of gun firing and one or two cars flying up in the air. It's the sort of thing you've seen in millions of films before, and often done much better than it is here. And as for being the 'Greatest Car Chase of All-Time', don't make me laugh. You'd have to be a moron to think that it could stand up to The French Connection or Bullit or Ronin. I even prefer the car chase in The Rock and I hate that sequence. I mean, at least it has the absurd zoom in, zoom out camera trick to fuel my rage. Here I was just apathetically shrugging my shoulders.The only decent bit of the car chase was the Ducati. What a beautiful bike. Oh, and Moss isn't a bad bike either. Seriously, all that money spent on special effects and your eyes still gravitate to an Italian bike and a woman's arse.But much worse than the car chase, which I'm merely apathetic to, was the fighting. Sweet Jesus the fight scenes were dull. All they consist of is a bit of flying about and tons of blocking. It's rare that anyone lands a punch. It's like they're playing Patty Cake. And most of the time the action serves no purpose. There's one bit where Neo (why does it always sound to me like people are addressing him as Neil? ""You're the one Neil"") fights hundreds of Agent Smiths. They fly about a bit and do tons more blocking. Occasionally someone lands a punch but then when the person goes flying into all the Agents you get an absurd ten-pin blowing noise. But then after this rubbish computer graphics demonstration, Neo just flies off. So what the hell was the point? I think the answer is a couple of sentences back. It's just to show off what the computer geeks can do. ""Hundreds of Agent Smiths? That would be so kewl!"" Sod the fact that the action has no consequences or that it does nothing to help drive the narrative forward. It's empty grandstanding and empty padding.Another dull action scene is the one where Neo fights lots of henchman in some French bloke's house. The turgid fighting is there but Neo can also stop bullets in midair. How can you care about someone that's invincible  especially someone that's both invincible and dull? One of the most unintentionally funny Neo scenes is where he has to kiss Monica Bellucci. Apparently she has to suffer being with some dull French bloke (who bores the audience to death in one of the million half-witted dialogue scenes) so she wants him to kiss her like he kisses Trinity. It's hilarious the way Reeves enters the Shatner school of acting. He looks at her and you can almost hear his thoughts, ""Kiss? IIdon't understand. It'sillogical."" But of course the reason that the scene's in the film is so that fanboys can soil their pants with fantasies of a quality of woman they'll never touch in a million years.Which brings me to the sex scene in the film. What a load of rubbish. You get more erotic movement out of an earthworm. And what kind of man is Neo? He almost cries when he comes. Although, having said that, the drums that play during the rave would probably make me cry too. All the party needed were whistles and glow sticks.But you see, the reason that sensitive, caring Neo gets emotional, is because he's worried about Trinity. Even though the two have no chemistry whatsoever. And just to show what an idiot he is, he chooses saving her over saving the world. How selfish can you get? But worse than the action, the sex, the sub-Stargate SG1 politics, the horrendous dialogue, the half-assed philosophy and the bad CGI (CGI Neo is just as unconvincing as the flesh and blood Neo) is the scene with The Architect. Nonsense dialogue gushes from his mouth, dialogue that in a deep and meaningful way is supposed to bring fresh revelations about The Matrix (there's talk of 'The Source' and other 'The Ones' and rebooting) but instead of being a speech on the nature of freedom of choice and all that jazz (if he's the Wachowski's idea of god, then god is more of a tool than I previously thought), it's merely a convoluted B-movie way of getting the hero to choose between saving the world and the girl. Of course Neo chooses the girl. Ergo, he's exactly the same as every hero out there. He loves his girl more than humanity. Idiot.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

But it's got to be one of the biggest disappointments in years, right up there with The Phantom Menace.  I send out about one movie recommendation a year to a large group of friends (the last was to recommend ""Punch Drunk Love""); this is the first time I've been moved to actually warn people. This is only too fitting because the first film gave us all so much hope that maybe these Wachowskis (who made Bound, for god's sake) were something really new and different for big-time Hollywood: relatively young people who could take ideas derived from absolutely everything they saw while growing up and yet turn them into something unique and utterly cool. Which they did. Once.It's really painful to watch a story so promising turn into bad Star Trek. It kills me how apologistic critics keep referring to the ""humanity"" of the film - trust me, any humanity it contains comes from a particularly bad episode of Deep Space Nine. Even the action sequences go on way too long and what's worse, do not contribute much of anything to the narrative. They are there because it's what everyone expects, not because they make any sense or have any relevance. I defy anyone to explain why the celebrated battle against 100 Agent Smiths is about: they can't kill him, he can't kill them, so it just ends. Huh? You can get that kind of brilliance in Tom & Jerry cartoons.$175 million in people and tech can't make up for a $1.98 script.

But those people who seem to think they're philosophy experts, filmmakers, and professional movie critics seem to be lacking common sense and a little background.The plot line, while being somewhat original, is derived from philosophy dating to Plato's ""The Republic,"" and continuing with many others (Descartes, Chuang-Tsu, Vasishtha, etc.). Essentially, it is a story of a false reality, one created by futuristic, autonomous machines. Throw aside all the techno stuff and you're left with the Cave story (from The Republic), in which Plato asserts that humans' realities can be manipulated, as from the day we are born we know nothing but that which is presented to us. Beyond that, The Matrix's plot is one that is a bit over-complicated, with too many side characters, which distracts us from the real messages of the story. So if you're having a tough time interpreting the movie, I wouldn't worry about it, as it's probably not as deep as you might have suspected. And in addition to the underlying philosophy, the character relationships add a whole different dimension to the movie, although they seem to go overlooked (it is sci-fi, i guess). Anyway, this movie is one of three, and they really have to be looked at in their entirety, not independently of each other.
In terms of the film's quality, we all know that, for one, Keanu Reeves is a horrible actor. Indeed, one doesn't go see The Matrix for the acting. But the Wachowski brothers did revolutionize special effects, and they were soon copied pretty much by everybody. And when some people complain that the sequel's use of the first movie's techniques is trite, just remember that it was theirs to begin with, and it was the rest of the entertainment industry that ruined it. But nonetheless, there are no serious flaws in the filmmaking, except for some long action sequences (but then again, it is an action movie, so suck it up).And to all those who complain about the ending, honestly, have some patience. It would be a shame if otherwise good movies would have to come up with hackneyed resolutions to appease people who can't wait for the sequel (ever seen LOTR? There's no ending, and that's OK). This movie isn't epic, or revolutionary, or anything; but the whole series just might be, so just wait.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Matrix Reloaded was insulting and I no longer have any interest in the trilogy.  If you're tempted to see it don't!!!

For some time now, I've been under the impression that the word ""pretentious,"" having roots in the word pretense (meaning fallacy, speciousness, artificial, et cetera) from where we get the word ""pretend,"" referred to a pathological state in which a person or group of persons has an erroneous appraisal of their intellectual worth such that they impress upon others a desire to be heralded as an exemplary paradigm within the intelligentsia.  This seemingly sequitur conclusion I've assumed was the correct usage of the word as implicitly suggested by its emic parts, but lately that doesn't seem to be the case.I've been reading many boards lately regarding the Matrix Reloaded and continuously see the word ""pretentious"" being used to pejoratively describe the movie concerning its delving into the philosophical.  I thought to myself that that seemed a little odd, for I saw the movie, I listened to the dialogue, and was unable to procure for myself any hint of where this proclaimed pretension was taking place.  All of the concepts brought forth were valid, all of the philosophical suggestions seemed in accordance with plot themes that were presented, and like most philosophical inquest, there were struggles amongst the characters to resolve issues.  It seems to me that there's nothing pretentious about it, definitely pedantic, because it is clearly evident that the Wachowski Brothers were heavily influenced here by a voluminous degree of intellectual tract stemming from Platonist essentialism to collapsible wave theory and probabilistic phenomenological existentialism.  And the brothers obviously have a wonderful command of language; I mean...did you hear the colloquial exchange between Neo and the Architect, simply brilliant, not to mention that Cornel West, one of the leading sociopolitical theorists and theodical philosophers, is a good friend of the filmmakers.  You have to be of a significant intellectual caliber to befriend a man that smart and that busy!So it seems to me that the word ""pretentious"" has taken on a new meaning...It now means: A pathological state in which the agent implementing the word, apropos circumstances of high degrees of intellectuality, does such in a defensively umbrageous manner attempting to mask their own inadequacies.Yeah, from the looks of things....that seems about right.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The plot was great and was very complicated and I almost didn't get some parts had to wrack my brain.

The dialogue in the Matrix always has meaning, but to appreciate it you need to realize that the words spoken are not supposed to convey it but to paint a picture of it.  The picture painted by the words is entirely subjective, so the same words will mean different things to different people.  If you're used to this style of communication, then you may even get to a point where you don't even hear the words but instead see the picture directly.The Wachowskis are obviously big fans of this style of dialogue, but they are not masters of it.  Some of the seemingly incomprehensible double-speak is really just that.  For example:""I know because I must know"" .. is circular and means nothing (looks like two snakes eating each other tail-first).  Let's paint a better picture:""I know because you must know""See?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I came out of the cinema deflated and asking the question 'did the W Brothers bother to watch the first film before making this one?'No green tint on the matrix parts of the film, art direction which was way below the standard of the first film, and a Neo that has suddenly got less power than before (had he had the same power he wouldn't have had to fight all those agent Smiths, but could have simply sent them all flying back through the air with a wave of his hand.)And what about the plot holes. Ok, so there's not as many in this as there is in The Phantom Menace, but that film broke all records. There's still a lot, like the Oracle's message somehow being solid beyond the Matrix.Basically it feels like all thought of plot cohesion and continuity with the previous film went out of the window.

The choreography of the fight scenes, the digital and special effects, all of that stuff is awesome.But effects and fighting don't make a movie.The first 45 minutes to the movie is almost painful to watch.  We have a 10 minute dancing sequence that we could have all done without, a lot of wooden, forced dialogue, just just plain a lot of uninteresting stuff.What the first movie had going for it -- ingenuity, novelty of the idea -- this one definitely does not.  The first one had a great story, an intelligent purpose.  This one -- it's pure actions fluff!  It isn't even a shadow of the first one's glory.Is it a bad movie?  Not at all.  It's definitely slow at times, but the fight scenes with Neo are absolutely astounding.  In this respect, it slays the first movie.  But the Matrix should be the type of movie where it's not all about how much cool stuff Neo can do, and that seemed to be the driving factor of this one.I miss the character and plot driven voyage the first movie took us on. This one is pure action -- and even then, it's sporadic, gapped by boring, forced dialogue that you really can't appreciate upon hearing the first time.  To really understand what happened in this movie other than some really neat fighting, I'll have to see it again.And the ending.... Well, it definitely leaves things open for Revolutions, but there's absolutely not closure whatsoever, like their semi-was in the first one.Anyway, definitely worth seeing for the fight scenes alone....  But the trailer is extremely misleading, and expect a lot of gaps in the action where you might find yourself tapping your fingers in frustration and impatience.7/10 for the fighting.Steve McVey","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

For the rest of us, like me, this movie is so-so.  I was not impressed with the Bullet Time 2 action sequences.  In fact, it was difficult to notice. However, granted that the action is stepped up to the thousandth power in this movie, the real drawback of this film is the overdone dialogue, especially when new characters are introduced.  The scenes involving Percephone's husband going on and on about cause and effect or the scene with the councilman talking about the definition of ""control"" was laughable, just to name a few.  Frankly, this isn't the first time I've heard this philosophical gobbledy-gook.  The great part about this movie is, aside from the stepped up action sequences (they were very well done), the actor who plays Morpheus.  He has a commanding presence on the screen. Unfortunately, his acting ability was not exploited in this movie, favoring, instead, Neo punching the lights out of just about every character in the movie. There is one scene in the movie, near the end, and tells Morpheus about the Oracle and his fallacy in his beliefs that struck my fancy.  In that scene, Morpheus is shocked by Neo's comments and one can see Morpheus' face reacting to the ungodly news.  If the movie exploited what went on in Morpheus' head at that time instead of wasting it on, say, Link's girlfriend or the insanely long techno dance scene, this movie would have been much better.  Further, after seeing the ending, I have a feeling that Revolutions, the final movie in the Matrix trilogy, is going to be a downer. There are too many things to discuss about this movie, especially the ones that seem overly done and out of place.  One has to see this movie and make his own judgements.  Again, I would recommend this movie for the enthusiast, not just anyone.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Was I ever in for a surprise.The Wachowski brothers took the road too well traveled by following up an original, atmospheric and stylish movie with a sequel that takes numerous over-choreographed and over-stylized action sequences and wraps them around a thin thread of story line laced with mediocre dialog and uninspired acting.  I found myself unable to care about the characters or their plight and instead just wished for it all to end.  Two hours and eighteen minutes later, my wish was granted.If your idea of a great night out is partaking in a smorgasbord of over-the-top action and competent if unoriginal computer generated effects, then by all means indulge.

Making a movie that's better than that is quite an accomplishment. I don't think the Watchowski's did it, but ""Matrix: Reloaded"" is just as satisfying to watch as ""The Matrix"". It has it's flaws, just as ""Matrix"" had it's flaws.The stakes are bigger, the action is bigger, and the plot is less dodgey. Neo has become comfortable in his role as the One, so his level of wire work and his use of Bullet-Time is much more evolved than in the first film.As stated, the plot is more straight-forward. Neo and the Rebels must combat a siege of Sentinels that will destroy Zion in 72 hours. That pretty much says it all. What I found interesting was that the plot for the movie works seamlessly with the plot for the ""Enter the Matrix"" game, which you should play if you want to see more of Niobe or Ghost. At the end of the game, there's even a sneak peak of ""Matrix: Revolutions"".As for what the film did wrong, I thought the cliffhanger was out of place. I hate ""To Be Continued"" endings, they leave me feeling unsatisfied. Also, I thought that the dance sequence went on for a bit too long, but I guess that was just to give the proper timing for the sex scene. That scene went on for too long and felt out of place. Who wants to see ""Matrix"" degenerated into a porno? But anything to see Carrie-Anne Moss naked, I guess.I loved ""Matrix: Reloaded"". Although it wasn't as good as it's predecessor, it sets up ""Matrix: Revolutions"" very well. Think of it as a stepping stone between the First and Third movies. Just think, it could've easily been worse.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'm not going to lie, some the eye candy was enjoyable but a good movie relies on its story and that is were Reloaded falls more than a bit short.  Reloaded often makes you ask ""what"" and some of the boring dialogue and many pointless scenes will leave you scratching your head.  My advice to those who want to see this movie is don't.

The bell sounds and - Frazier and Ali spend the next half hour discussing French literary theory. Sure, eventually Frazier gets disgusted with Ali's neo-Freudian deconstructionist attitude and starts throwing punches but by that time the crowd's snoring. That, in a nutshell, is the experience of The Matrix Reloaded. This movie has stunts, fights and spectacular action to spare after you've sat through enough gaseous bloviating to float the Hindenburg.In The Matrix we learned that Sentient Machines have enslaved the human race. Physically humans live in a cocoon hooked up to enormous electrical collectors. Mentally, however, they live within `The Matrix', a vast virtual reality designed to emulate 21st century earth.  We followed the adventures of Neo as he finds he may be `The Chosen One' to lead the Human Race out of bondage. The Matrix Reloaded starts a short while after the events of the first movie. Machines have discovered the location of the free human city of Zion and are out to destroy it. Only Neo and his band of rebels offer any hope of salvation.The leads do a decent job staying ahead of the special effects. Keanu Reeves' strong suit, looking vaguely puzzled by the world about him, works well for Neo the befuddled virtual messiah. Carrie-Anne Moss again is memorable as Trinity.  Unfortunately, her character has devolved from the tough resistance leader of the first movie to being Neo's babe in this one. While Moss has her share of action scenes, Trinity's prime function now is to be saved by Neo. Laurence Fishburne's endlessly philosophical Morpheus handles the bulk of the movies speechifying. When not pontificating, Morpheus is given to looming stoically over Neo's shoulder.  Only Fishburne's charisma keeps this leaden character from bringing the movie to a screeching halt. Hugo Weaving's dryly-humorous take on the evil Agent Smith gives his scenes some needed verve and Gloria Foster as the all-knowing Oracle perks up a potentially slow patch. The rest of the cast tends to be swallowed by the blood and thunder and the sprawling dull patches.Once past the first half hour or so the action picks up dramatically. You are rewarded for your patience with fabulously impossible martial arts displays, spectacular action sequences and the mother of all chase scenes. These are the stuff of summer movie heaven. However, even as events start to hurtle along, Neo and his pals are wont to take lengthy breaks for their sit-down palavers.It can't be stressed enough how much the endless nattering hurts The Matrix Reloaded.  The speeches are so clumsily written that most of the actors have their tongues tripped up. Only Weaving and Foster manage to put an entertaining spin on them. The content - speculations on the nature of reality, free will, causality and the like - resemble the type of philosophical gibberish you'd hear around a half empty keg in the hospitality suite of a Star Trek convention. Don't get me wrong here. Most of The Matrix Reloaded is a heck of a lot of fun but you might want to wait for the DVD and the relief of a fast forward button.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

My buddy pointed out that I'd probably have to take a number.A LOT of fuss has been made about this film, but none of it really stacks up. As a transitory piece I'm sure it works quite well, storywise. As a dime a dozen kung-fu flick it works wonderfully. But, as a self-proclaimed staple in ""hard sci-fi"" moviedom, it falls flatter than flat.The character development is limited to Morpheus and his crumbling beliefs, a concept and a story thread that feels extremely alien after the revelations of the first film. The story goes from point A, trips over dozens of fight scenes (most of them unnecessary) and grueling philosophical expositions (we, as an audience, can think for ourselves, I'd like to imagine) and finally reaches point B, which could have been met about 20 minutes into the film had the special digital effects gods not been at the helm.I will admit that the scene on the freeway was truly impressive, and I found myself fixed to the screen. Beyond that, though, action scenes are action scenes wherever you go, and even though I can fully appreciate the tremendous amount of work that goes into them, if you cook a full course steak dinner for your date, you have to accept the fact that she might just be happy with the appetizer. I very much would have been happy with an appetizer on this one.Still, I was pleased with the social commentaries maintained in the film, particularly the racial representation and power structure (where The Man is is always a white guy in a suit, and the downtrodden come from all walks of life)... those were very nice.Aside from that, and Fishbourne's incredibly intense presence, there isn't too much working for the Matrix Reloaded (except for a ton of money and merchandising, that is... funny how that works out, isn't it?)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There are more and longer action scenes, there is more story, and more flesh.  First the action scenes.  All the fight scenes are well-choreographed and performed.  Of course many people would consider the 100 agent smiths vs Neo scene the highlight fight scene which has some validity.  Not so much so for the fighting (which is great dont get me wrong) but more for the special effects.  only on very few occassions is it obvious that Neo or agent smiths were all CGI but the majority of the time it is very difficult to tell. In my opinion though, the best fight scene would be in the mansion.  I believe this becuase, there is little to no CGI, it is mainly wire work.  Also Keanu Reeves uses an assortment of weapons including: a long sword, sais, twin sticks, and a staff.  Now on to the chase sequence towards the end.  One of the people is quoted, ""The best car chases ever."" while making the scenes. This is not a lie.  The Washowski bros. set up some of the most extravagant car crashes and captued them on film in ways crashes has yet to filmed. In many cases you would want to tell yourself that it is CGI but it just looks too good to be CGI.  About the only times they used CGI was when people were invilved (the agent jumping on the car, people turning into agents) and it seemed that there was only one crash in which it was heavily aided by computer effects ( a crash invilving two semis and there two people flying off of one of the semis). As for the story, I will just say it goe more in depth about all the major characters as wel as introducing some new ones.One thing to keep in mind is that this movie does not end, it stops. However, the last 10 or fifteen minutes or so has some of the most bizzare explanations and a couple of strange events (one of them being a real sappy one but stil a little weird).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Not as 'together' as the first, but also some improvements","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0703581/?ref_=tt_urv","kmn140","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2357875/?ref_=tt_urv","16 May 2003","I won't comment on the technical effects, as anyone who has seen the 'burly brawl' or the head-on highway collision scene will tell you the effects are a generation ahead...The movie has a lot of action and several well-choreographed fight sequences but of course the philosophy is still there and takes up most of the beginning of the movie. The story is actually a bit more complicated than the simpler we-have-been-living-a-lie plot that the first movie followed. Memorable scenes include the talk with the oracle and the architect.However, while I enjoyed reloaded more than the first matrix (tho the two are complementary and anyone who owns one should have the other) there are some loose threads. In the first matrix, basically everything was concluded, yet in reloaded, we don't really know what happened with the twins, or with Niobe, for example. Of course, they may appear again in the third film, but left me wondering...Also, the trailer shows some scenes that are absent or redone (or maybe I was too engrossed to notice them?) in the movie, namely the upside-down cartwheel gun sequence, and a shot of the group firing akimbo towards the camera.Overall, great fun to watch, but you gotta enjoy the talk as well as the action.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Reloaded? No, these are the Answers to a School Quiz.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704226/?ref_=tt_urv","Aberlass","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0312794/?ref_=tt_urv","23 May 2003","This story does not make sense as a film. It reminds me of 'Lord of the Rings' 1 - unless you are a fan of the Lord of the Rings it means nothing as it's all just special effects, then ends without ending. The dilemma I faced was that I am a fan of Matrix 1, so how couldn't I love Matrix 2?I finally realized what Matrix 2's very serious flaw is: filmic codes. All films must (whether we know or not) must contain the black & white, in other-words - opposites. This means a brilliant film must make us feel passionately about what is a good belief & what is a bad belief. It must make us care & there must be moments of comedy. Name (or imagine) villain/rival in matrix 1 (he was bad & we hated what he did), then in Matrix 2 (who?). See the difference? Matrix 2 only hinted, even saving it for the last frame. Emotionally an audience needs more than this, we need to fixate & hate, so we can appreciate the hero & his suffering/'quest'. Matrix 2's theme is; 'replication' (sexual, cloned or virus)- Agent Smith (plural), Zee's love dance, Neo's love scene, the Twins, the Keymaster, etc, all represent perpetuity, continuity of life. With such strong 'Order'/Rules we also need equally strong Chaos represented. No believable challenge is presented! This is the very serious flaw in this film - the audience is lectured to, but never given anything to care about. We can see the message, but the adversary or adversity is so diluted (over several 'cameo' baddies) that we are not given a central hate target to pit Neo's meagre team against. Matrix 2 is not a complete film & ends in the wrong place. Where it does end is a cliffhanger, fair enough, but a 'tv' one, not a cinematic one. Ideally it should end after Neo saves Trinity. That way we are left wondering about everyones fate in a natural climactic manner, where we are on a high because he saved her. Strangely, this is the 1st question of the whole film, unlike Matrix 1 where scene 1 raised the 1st question, not the last one!!! When Matrix 2 ends on a 'baddie' it highlights the fact that there haven't been any in the film (no real threat), hence exaggerates this significant exclusion, which leaves us definitely dissatisfied.'The Brothers' must have thought they were doing us a favour by answering our questions in Matrix 2, but then ask any wisoned parent & they will tell you that kids never thank them for imparting their wisdom. 'The brothers' should have got to the next chapter of their own lives before making the next 2 films, because then they would know that the answer is always a question & never a lecture.My Rating - FX = 10/10, Plot = 2/10, Comparison to Matrix 1 5/10Who should see this film - People who like to be told what to think & enjoy a strong musical score to their thinking. Respect the certification. This is NOT Matrix 1, it has no benefit for kids. If it says for 15yrs old it means it. This film is confusing & will take several viewings, plus film 3 to make full sense. You do not need to see this film if you love Matrix 1 (no new philosophy/spirituality). This film needed new questions to keep it real, but there are none.End of story.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Slower and Less innovative","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704213/?ref_=tt_urv","NipponCRITIC","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2407723/?ref_=tt_urv","22 May 2003","The first matrix movie was definitely innovative and original. The concept of special effects and martial arts combined on a philosophical backbone was really unique. Unfortunately, the uniqueness wore off in the sequel.MINUSES: Without giving much away - I really thought much of the love scenes between Trinity and Neo could have been downplayed. Some occasional scenes of blood and violence that I thought the movie could have done without.The movie starts out pretty slow and drags - but I think it ends in a positive way (minus the cliffhanger) - but it definitely keeps the audience in anticipation for the next movie.PLUSES: Definitely innovative and new special effects. The use between the ""stop-time"" effect and real time was very well synchronized. When you see Neo fighting and then other characters such as Morpheus, you were really able to tell that there is something very special about the character of Neo.I enjoyed how the storyline made you think about explanations to the events - who is actually good and who is bad - and what exactly is the role of Neo?Overall a good movie - but more for adults and older teens than the first matrix. I would definitely go see the final matrix as it comes out -

Why?  Lack of time. The Wachowski Brothers have written a story that doesn't stand in three independent segments.  It stands in one, and only one.  But how many people are going to sit through a six and a half hours of a story they've never seen before?Matrix Introduction to the story and explanation of the deeper lines of thought. Introduces characters and what they do....Neo is freed from the Matrix and must realize his ONEness.  After realizing his ONEness, his internal struggle is over, and he simply must overcome everything else.Reloaded This is the ""kicking ass"" part of the movie.  It's like a large project. Once the planning and methods are determined and set, it simply comes down to chewing through the wood.  Struggles are primarily in the beginning of a project, and everything in-between is just pudding.For those of you who dislike this movie because Neo was ""too"" perfect, oh well.However, the Agent Smith battle did seem to drag on.  Personally, I was waiting for him to just raise his hand and say ""No"" to Agent Smith and that would be his end.  It just seemed to take too long.  And my only other complaint was the CGI work for the Agent Smith fight.  They should have put more texture to the characters.  They did an excellent job with the physics, impact, and sound effects.  However, the texture of clothing and skin is surpassable easily many other movies.  They should have spent more time on it.Everything else was excellently done.  The sex scene was tasteful.  It conveyed the passion Neo and Trinity held while not showing her in the nude, actually maintaining a dignity for her character.  As far as the Party went, and the note of the majority of attendees were African in heritage, does it really matter?  For all we know there may have been an all white version of Matrix and then an all Asian or a good mix and we simply saw one version. Remember the Architect saying that there were already, what, six Zion generations? (in so many words)  You get the idea. The fight scenes were good.  And as far as the slow-mo repetition, it's the ""Matrix thing.""  It's a classic cinematic move with the Matrix, so why bash it.  Consider it consistency, and be grateful.  This is good.The chase scene Motorlust... rariarhah... (drool).  (Mr Burns) Excellent.  True, sell-out to Cadillac.  Oh well.  At least they weren't in an El Camino.  I wonder what Morpheus contributed to the Twins' Caddy in flipping over.  Just wondering. But definitely good.  The CGI was done beautifully with the chase scene. Maintaining proper textures and motophysics, I was, well, yeah.Monica Belucci Scene Unneeded, but very funny.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The reasons are numerous, but the most obvious of which is that Avatar does what it does only better. What bothers me most about the Matrix however, is that it is more of an idea than it is a movie. Too much of the screenplay is exposition from badly delivered super cheesy dialogue, and the movie just needs more action. Well, good thing then for Matrix Reloaded, which gives us just that. Now that we are in the world, we get to see Neo and his gang kick-butt in it. If it didn't take about ninety minutes of screen time (in The Matrix) to enter the world, there would have been room for some of this adrenaline. The action of course comes at the cost of story, but it's not like there was much of one to begin with anyways. My one complaint about this film is the anti-climax, of the last twenty-thirty minutes. I guess if I am going to give you advice it would be this. If you thought the Matrix was interesting yet mediocre, don't walk away so fast. Matrix Realoaded takes things up a notch and may give you what you want.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Yeah.  Bored?  Not that bad.  Momentarily blown away?  Sure.  Maybe the ""Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy has spoiled me into thinking that sequels can actually be worthwhile.  But if you're comparing this film with the original ""Matrix""...there is no comparison. Fantastic special effects, INCREDIBLE car chase, fight scenes galore - but what happened to the story?  There were two many pauses for SHOWING OFF. And what was with the 5 minute orgy scene that completely HALTED the film so that we could watch undulating bodies in sheer garb and maybe catch a nipple, or 17?!  Why do filmmakers think they have to add pointless sex scenes to up the appeal?  Do we really need to see two actors (uncomfortably bare) exchanging their ""O"" faces to believe their characters are in love? Maybe that could be accomplished with...oh, I don't know...GOOD WRITING? It just felt like the director was throwing in all of the bells and whistles possible to distract the audience from the fact that the story doesn't really start until about 45 minutes into it.  Or maybe he just likes nipples.  As for the beautifully choreographed fight sequences - beautifully choreographed, as always.  Except for Neo's battle with the multiplying agents, a little too computer animated and cartoonish for me.  Other than that, I liked the new characters (very creative), loved the highly stylized look of the film, and enjoyed the twist at the end - which makes one feel that the 3rd movie will be the real kicker.

""Reloaded"" is a movie that will not be understood quickly. I saw it last night and I am still pondering it today. I believe though that the movie will make far more sense after Revolutions is released. The one thing that bugged me about this movie was the way it just stops at the end.

Plenty of action and big explosions for those looking for it and there are some very interesting dialogue scenes as well (Neo and the Architect). This movie equals the first, but does not outdo it, which is what I think the directors were after. The new additions to the cast add a little extra as well (Zee is extremely underrated in my opinion).Some reviews written by others have criticized this film for leaving open too many ""loose ends"" and not providing solid answers to all the questions. That's the point of it all. Some of the questions are there so the audience can answer them and perhaps there are multiple answers for these questions (why was a certain decision made near the end of the movie? for example).
The thing I appreciated most about this film is that it keeps you thinking long after you leave the theatre.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

(1999).During the first hour of ?Reloaded? it is as if George Lucas somehow downloaded the ?Phantom Menace? virus into the creative database of the Wachowski Brothers, infecting the once lean stealth-like ?Matrix? with endless discussion and senatorial deliberation! The bloated sequel ironically now reflects the ?Star Wars? franchise, which it so devastatingly broadsided in the summer of 1999. However, the issues are very different. Whilst ?Menace? was bereft of a cohesive and engaging story. This second act is all but an indigestible narrative. A rich semiological montage of academic musings and high octane opium that commands repeated viewing!By the pale moonlight, a haunting silhouette of Neo instantly transforms into an homage to both Batman and Superman. Sending shivers down the spine of this fan!The arrival of Persephone (Monica Bellucci) raises the sexual tension and ?Reloaded? takes flight, never ceasing to amaze and astound. Culminating in a breathtaking car chase. In less assured hands this 15 minute race would have been unsustainable, here it becomes quintessential cinema. Sending seismic shock waves that will be felt for years to come. A convincing reminder of the audacious and adroit talent of the Wachowskis and their production team.The star of the movie is unquestionably Carrie-Anne Moss, who is the emotional counterpoint to Keanu Reeves? detachment. Trinity is an angular shadow dramatically aspected against state-of-the-art bombast.It appears that even Neo isn?t immune to the curse of Narcissus! But ?Reloaded? is a pool worth swimming in.

You are now somewhere in the characters real lives and seeing outside their macho Matrix facades.""The most disappointing sequel in recent memory""The Matrix Reloaded is, by definition, a sequel. However, it is only half of the sequel. Rather than create a 5 1/2 hour monster, the Wachowskis decided to cut it in half, trilogy style, and release the next half in November. Think how you would feel if they went Lord of the Rings and waited a whole year to release the next one. I was saddened to hear that the movie ""had no ending"" and ""could have ended after the opening credits"" (although there were no opening credits). THERE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO BE AN ENDING! The Ending is in November!""I was waiting for the movie to come out of its sleepy boring state""This movie was the setting, the precursor for what Revolutions will be. If you want to enjoy it, it takes time. After all, the Wachowskis DID NOT create this movie for us and I guarantee that they would not change anything because of what an audience wanted. I can already hear the retorts (""Well, we're the ones who see the movie, we should decide what makes it""). Not entirely. Without new ventures in filmmaking, we would not have had greats like the original.If you haven't already, pick up a copy of The Matrix Revisited. It provides real insight into the movie and you will get a lot out of seeing it before the sequel, or even watching the original again.

Come on, you people have seen so much eye candy in movies that the cinematogrophy alone shouldn't wow you this much. Maybe it's just me, but the slow parts of the film were tedious.

The first one was such a great viewing experience in the cinema that the second installment was a must-see in the cinema as well. Being two and a quarter hours into the story line, 'The Matrix Reloaded' loses the coolness factor the first one had of exploring the paranoid fantasy (that you yourself may have entertained) of everything we experience just being a computer simulation. The story seemed to be told on a slightly different level than the first, going more into the destiny of neo and the humans vs machines battle rather than telling an on-the-surface account like the first one did. This wrecks the consistency a little bit, but I didn't consider that to be a problem here.The Matrix Reloaded answers some questions (and raises more); We get to see Zion, Neo's increasing powers, Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) getting a lot more interesting and dangerous, and the part the matrix itself plays in the destiny of the man-machine confrontation. I thought there was too much time spent on highly choreographed fight scenes (making them look more like an elaborate dance than a spontaneous fight) early on, towards the end of the film there was a considerable quickening of the storytelling pace as if to make up for lost time.It's not perfect, but all in all the Matrix reloaded is another kick-ass viewing experience, and takes it's place in what will be one of the great sci-fi trilogies.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's even harder to find something that has the two of these elements in such good shape as ""The Matrix Reloaded"" does. We still haven't seen the third film, but I'm sure this trilogy is much more than just an action one. Even if it was, it would be brilliant, once the fighting and car crash scenes are beautifully done. Matrix is something that unites greatly action adventures with highly intelligent philosophical dialogues. While some people may feel bored during the minutes the characters discuss things like chance, choice, cause and consequence, some others, like me, just can't avoid feeling good at those speeches. ""Matrix"" is different from anything we have seen before. It's much more than just one more good movie. It's an evidence smart cinema is still there and it's our hope that some other directors also make something deeper that challenges our perception of reality and makes some of our dreams and illusion come true. Just like ""Matrix"" did. When it comes to perception of reality, ""Matrix"" made me remember Jostein Gaarner's ""Sophie's World"", one of the best books I ever read, where the protagonist said adults could not accept things that go against daily routine and the old tellings they have always heard from others. ""Matrix"" is really a philosophy lesson. My rate 10 out of 10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They have constructed an entertaining blockbuster. The advertising and budget has served the film well. It does exactly what it says on the tin. The action is asthetically pleasinng, and relies more on the choreography, special effects and the actors ability rather than the directors.The story line is not much to go by. I feel that the directors may have even confused themselves in this one. By the end of the film they have complicated the plot too much and it actually retracts from the film rather than complimenting it.I feel that the Zion stuff is all too unimportant and there seems to be, what i have labelled as George Lucas syndrome, spread throught. As they have tried to mix politics with spectical. It seems that Hollywood just will not learn that you cannot make politics exciting, and just trying to achieve it makes things worse. The club/sex scene it just possibly once of the most random moments in a film ever, and the directors are definately leading some form of secret s and m lifestyle.There is not really much new material in the form or structure of this sequal. Just different characters and because Neo is now the one the fighting styles have become more complex.The Matrix Reloaded has forfilled what is set out to do.

The first Matrix wasn't brilliant, a mangled rehash of Dark City, Terminator and Fist of Legend, with some interesting effects. At least it held the interest though, but this? The fight scenes were so full of effects that they were unrecognizable as Yuen's work. Keanu was dull, Laurence Fishburne was stiff and clumsy in both acting and fighting, and Carrie-Anne Moss, the best mover of the three, got hardly any screen time doing anything remotely interesting (gazing lovingly at Keanu does not count).The script varied between cheesy and just plain bad, and I found it very difficult to care about any of the characters. Is this really the same people that made Bound?However, there were a few saving graces.

I was very much looking forward to the second film, Reloaded. I understand that many sci-fi films are not outstandingly noted for their scripts or general plots. But this film was a disappointment to me. SPOILAGE AHEAD! I have seen love stories in science fiction television shows and movies that were beautifully poignant. But the Neo/Trinity love story never seemed well-developped enough to justify his choice at the end of the film. His choice, to me, also compromised his standing as a hero. I am a fan of ""Buffy"", the television series, and have to say, season two, when she had to make the choice to save the world by killing her one true love, proved her to truly be worthy of ""the chosen one"". When Buffy sacrificed herself to save the world (again) in season five, she again proved herself a hero. This was what Neo seemed to lack; the ability to realize that as ""the one"" he might have to make sacrifices, and I suppose that this simply, let me down. I was also sorely disappointed in the regression of Trinity's character. In the first film, she kicked some serious butt. In this installment, she was Neo's girlfriend. To be honest, I would have a hard time believing Neo would still really love this woman since she had become such a wuss, and so far from the strong woman he had fallen in love with. I found this film to be lacking any strong female main characters to speak of. Niobe, while certainly a strong character was never given enough time on screen for the viewer to see her ""strong"" side, though I look forward to seeing more in the next film. Persephone was outstanding (I admit to some bias as I believe Monica Bellucci to be a phenomenal actress). I wish they had fleshed out her character more! The idea of a character like hers - a woman who cannot feel on her own, but must feel emotion through others is very intriguing to me. Overall, this may have been an important stepping stone to the third film, but unlike some other recent sci-fi series that have been made into films, this installment would not stand on its own. I would recommend it, as it seems needed for the third movie, but I admonish the filmmakers for making a film that was far too long for so little to have happened.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Good job to the filmmakers! You've worked hard and you deserved it!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In fact, there is nothing disapointing about it, but it took me almost 2 months after it came out, before I step into the cinema to see it.The reason for the wait is that the trailers looked exaggerated, and hence, I rather wait what the early movie going guinea pigs say about it. And since I have heard both negative and positive reviews, I was prepared to purchase the movie experience that Wanner Bros is trying to sell.
Going back 8 years, when I went to see 'Jingle All the Way' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, the start of the film made me realize the level of expectation to the film, which I think was intentional. With Reloaded, I had to make a lower expectation to the film, obviously due to the bad reviews, to actually marvel at the work from those Hollywood artists, both acting and crafting - Hey! Does someone think that I cheat my way to enjoy a lousy sequel; my friend who saw it with enjoyed it.Yes, this film has a lot of chitchat, but it is the prime reason to get the answers for why mankind has been slaved by machines, and what is to be expected from the machines, and what is the next step for both mankind and machines. This is a half-action-half drama film, most X-files fans should enjoy it, and it should disappoint those who hate dramas.Lastly and also going back 13 years to the Back to the Future sequels, (which was also filmed back-to-back like the Matrix sequels) the end of the Part 2 has a trailer to the Part 3. It is the same where Reloaded has a short trailer to Revolutions.WHAT!!! - You did not see any trailer at the end of the movie, why, did you leave half way when the credits was rolling  LOSER!!!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That it may have some ""pseudophilosophical"" content is not the point. They are telling an existential story and this piece was a necessary transition furthering that story. Animatrix was to the same purpose, plus adding some flesh to the bones of that story.We stand at the turn of a man-made milepost-- the millenium-- witnessing the death, finally, of some very old man-made explanations of Why We Are Here. Can anyone doubt that the time for religion as a model of the universe is past (save the diehards who seek either the control or the succor that religion provides) Can anyone doubt that a new future is before us and we don't *really* understand where it is taking us? Can anyone doubt that we humans are *still* asking the same questions: Why... What *purpose*? Even hardcore athiests and pure reductionists are uncertain. (Witness, even Carl Sagan, who never saw a God he much cared for,  laid more questions than answers at our feet.) No scientist worthy of the appellation can ever claim that mankind, at least in our current state, can understand What Is Going On. We now have six billion people on this planet. We are doing Very Bad Things to one another. Old systems are beginning to fail. We, as humans, need to evolve a bit if we expect this all not to end VERY badly. Maybe the Wachowskis are just trying to tell a story about that uncertainty and fear and need to understand that many humans are feeling very deeply just about now.And, to my mind, they are doing a pretty damned good job of marrying good story telling with amazing movie technology to do that. I'm looking forward to their conclusion.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'm not a film maker. I don't understand the complexities of making a full-length feature film, therefore I never felt qualified to pass judgment on those that have.I do however pay good money to see films, and always enter any film with great enthusiasm and optimism. If a film looks bad (ie: bad cast, bad director, unnecessary sequel, overbearing hype, etc), I vote with my wallet, and simply don't go. Despite all of that, and out of pure curiosity, I went to see the matrix reloaded.The first matrix was a C grade film. Bad acting, confusing, illogical plot and total lack of atmosphere. It introduced us to repetitive, slow-motion, 360 degree view action sequences and spawned millions of imitations. The matrix reloaded is just that; reloaded. It's just that there's more of it.It's more of the same. Same bad acting, bad directing, bad script, bad music and more repetitive slow motion than anyone has ever attempted to fill a movie with before.This is an ugly film.It looks bad, it makes absolutely no sense, and feels like you're watching someone play a video game. The characters are one-dimensional and totally void of any and all emotion. Every single meaningful piece of dialogue starts with the words ""I believe...""There is absolutely no conflict or suspense in the entire film because any time conflict arises, it's simply dealt with in a straight forward, non-challant manner. If your characters can do anything, then what's the point? Someone dies, so bring them back to life. 500 men attack you, so just beat them all up.If you like explosions, repetitive, slow motion action sequences, long, rambling techno jargon and zero plot or suspense, then this film is for you! 10 out of 10!If you like thinking, stay at home.

It wasn't as original as many people say and the fighting scenes were rather boring if you compare them to actionscenes in movies like DAO - the Blade, Iron Monkey, Once Upon a Time in China or Red Wolf, but still it was an entertaining movie.This Reloaded-thingy isn't as good as the first one. It's special effects are worse (I just HATE that scene where there's plenty of CGI Mr. Smiths fighting against CGI Neo... It just couldn't look any worse!), it's plot is worse and it's fighting scenes are even more boring than in the first one. The story tries to be very ""deep"", but actually it's just cheesy sci-fi nonsense... quite entertaining nonsense, but still pure nonsense.One of the worst things in the movie is the very beginning. It's just horrible. Trinity rides a motorcycle -- Trinity destroys a building -- Trinity falls trough a window of some other building and shoots some agent. It's senseless, boring and the ""bullet-time"" just doesn't work in here like it worked in the first Matrix.On the positive side, I really liked the ""highway scene"". It was fast and stylish. I also liked the interesting ending of the movie. I even liked the rave scene (which seems to be the most hated part of the movie), but those good points in this movie couldn't cover it's weaknesses.If you want to see good martial arts action, look elsewhere. If you want to see interesting sci-fi movie, look elsewhere. If you want to see good Matrix-material, watch Animatrix. If you want to see entertaining mixture of sci-fi, Action, Real-Life-Anime and Monica Bellucci(!), you should give this movie a try.(Three Stars) * * *","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Expecting to see a tight and fast-paced comicbook movie like its predecessor, I was faced with a more evolved cerebral beast.  I walked out of the cinema not really knowing what I had just seen & not feeling much of an impact.Matrix: Reloaded was released on DVD last week.  The time between the cinema release and renting the DVD gave me some breathing space to discard preconceived ideas and re-evaluate the movie on its own merits, without so much hype & expectation colouring my impressions.  What I found was a movie that was more rewarding to watch, and I was able to see the depth and effort that had been put into it.  Previous scenes which I felt weakened the movie turned out to be strengths in some way - the organic rhythm of Zion's final party and the verbose ponderings on purpose, choice & causality add contrast & substance to what could have otherwise turned into yet another fluff sci-fi holiday flick.Matrix: Reloaded certainly has its flaws, and I don't think it will join the ranks of the 'classics', but it stands up to repeated viewing. I believe it achieves what good movie should - make us think about it, ourselves & the world we live in.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Well I must confess that prior to seeing this I had seen some very negative reviews on various sites so I went in expecting little - what I got was a mixed bag. The premise as it stands at the end of the film is intriguing - the idea that the Matrix, to work, has to offer a choice of acceptance or rejection and that this inevitably means (1) the growth of a community of rejectors (Zion) that will ultimately endanger the Matrix unless checked (2) the emergence of an anomaly in the form of Neo who acts as the rebalancer or even rebooter of the Matrix. The hints suggest that Neo is in fact a Matrix program of some form that has become human and that his discovery of love in this 6th incarnation has allowed him to bridge that gap - he now affects machinery in the 'real world' and the idea about both machine and man needing each other for existence will be tied up in Revolutions - though any point of this chain could just be a lie by the Architect or you could have the 'dream within a dream' scenario where even the 'real world' is a Matrix encompassing a smaller one - all these possibilities exist and the film sets these up as well as can be expected - though I fear the Architect's speech could have been too confusing for younger audience members. However a lot of the other ponderings on causality and choice elsewhere in the film are frankly inane and cod-philosophising at its worst.The FX were good if not great in parts. However we have come to expect this and Matrix I is largely to blame - ironic that you get knocked down because you did such a good job before but seems characteristic of much of life. However two points do start to grate:1) Neo had begun manipulating the code at the end of 1. His inability to do this and his subsequent fights etc. in Reloaded are partially explained by 'upgraded agents' and 'mutating / altered coding' but it just doesn't really cut the mustard - the directors seem to realise this and scuttle past it in their desire to pack in as much kung-fu-chop-socky as possible.2) The fighting has become too stylised - no-one seems to really get injured apart from a couple of the Merovingian's goons - that is understandable with agents but it just gets a bit boring after a while for anyone who isn't a kung-fu fanatic.I really don't think this film is bad - I always feared that the directors had pushed the abilities of Neo too far at the end of the first one for anything to be left for a 2nd & 3rd and they have proved me partially right and partially wrong. Any comparison with the childish drivel & nonsense that was Attack of the Clones and Phantom Menace is way off mark.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

No.. Not on the complexity or depth of the movie, but rather the after impact that will continue to last (or haunt) you for days, months or years.I will term watching the movie (Both The Matrix and Reloaded) as ""Seed Planting"". While taking months for the movie to gradually grow and root deeply in you, you wouldn't even realize after you've grown to love it so much. It happened in the first movie, negative comments were posted, reviews and remarks where speculated, complaining on the lack of story, lack of acting, confusing plots, too much Fx, etc. But today, when it's time for the Matrix to catch up with you, probably, exactly that same group who posted such messages are the one who queued up head front to get to the sequel. I for one, is one of them.I generally laud the opinion of watching it couple of times before making comments. As far as I am concerned, why compare a sequel? isn't it just as pleasant to view episode 1 and episode 2 of Friends? Let the experience continues.......I still love LOTR, Star Wars more.

It is our nature to be drawn and compelled to them as they satisfy an innate need to know and understand. The biblical stories are what most of us can relate to.  How different is Neo from the character Moses, a chosen one given divine powers to free the his people? How different is his situation from Noah when faced with the responsibility of repopulating earth after annihilation?  And let's not forget the red pill ""apple"" Neo chose to exile himself from utopia or ignorance. What is the significance of being the 6th one? Was there light on the 'sixth' day?? Does Neo have a brother like Cain and Abel? These are just few of the evident biblical connotations... however these concepts are far from new but it's unique because it's all rolled up into 1 entity.Anyway, (all the other philosophical dialogue aside) is it also seems to incorporate the element of time.  Going back to my previous mention of the big bang, it is also theorized that the universe will one day begin to shrink again into a capsule only to start over again.

Worst movie ever? No. Worst movie this year? No. Worst sequel this year? No. I think the only way to really judge this movie is to see the movie coming out in a few months. Then the story will be complete. Either this movie sets it up right and the next will finish off the storylines started in the first movie; or they'll drop the ball and both movies won't look good.As far as this movie goes, it was ok. The one thing I think people easily forget is that the car chase in this movie makes all the other car chases ever made look dull and pointless by comparison. There wasn't too much philosophical jargon. I think the beginning of the movie is weak and poorly done. I was almost ready to walk out. However, after about 1/2 an hour things picked up and we all forgot the bad beginning. The end of the film was just that...it ended. There was no sense that one story was done and the next will pick up on loose storylines and have another story. The movie just stopped where the next will most likely start.However, I will give the writers credit for that guys' line about french swearing. Probably one of the funniest things I ever heard in a movie theater. Overall, an entertaining movie for what it is.

I was seriously anticipating this movie, and while LoTR Two Towers did not disappoint as a sequel, this did.  I got the feeling that this movie was basically bait for the 3rd and final of the series.  This movie is a jumbled collection of lengthy soliloquys held together by lengthy action sequences.  The plot never really gels IMO, and an hour into the film I looked at my watch wondering when something would happen.  There's no continuity here, with little character development beyond the main players from the first film, and definitely not enough to support the entire Zion twist.Plot complaints aside, stylistically this movie is still top-notch, particularly the repeated dream sequence with Trinity, but I go to movies (and yes, shell out $$$) for more than eye candy, and I left feeling like I'd had a bunch of candy, but was still hungry for some reason.Here's to hoping for more of a story in the final movie.YMMV,John","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And I must admit, there are some that are very impressive, and some that just made me twitch because you could tell a character was CGI or not.As for story ... there were plenty of amusingly funny lines, but there were some scenes I think could have been taken out, I mean after a 10 minute fighting scene I think it gets a little boring after a while, and then 5 minutes after the fight scene it goes back to another 10 minute scene. Oh, and I'm SO sure they needed the rave scene, I'm sorry, although my friends seem to think it's the best part of the movie, it's just a bore waiting to be ended, and all it did was disturb me when ever I saw the holes in Neo's back.Now, the freeway scene, which for half of it was amazing, and the other half was just ... eh .. like when Trinity drives the motorcycle in the wrong direction on the freeway it really seems like the camera is just fallowing her through and under the cars. However, when there is a fight on top of the truck, you can SO tell they use that old fashioned way of filming one of those scenes with the screen moving while the characters fight ... just so disturbed me, but I guess that's probably the best they could do.Well I guess it's about a 7/10 ...

I am a huge fan of, well, the Matrix. That is to say, The Matrix. I am not, I regret to say, a huge fan of the Reload. Gravity defying kung-fu fights are cool; overly long repetitive gravity defying kung-fu fights are not. Kicking multiple Agent Smiths around is cool.....at first. Kicking multiple Agent Smiths around, and around,... and around..... and then flying off is not especially cool. Listening to Morpheus pontificate in a sort of Zen drone barely started off cool, and quickly descended into the Hollywood version of benign zealotry. Unless something really cool is planned for them in Episode 3 (The Matrix strikes back), what was the point of the Euro-Trash and his evil princess? Trinity, jealous? Are they kidding? Lest you think otherwise, the movie wasn't a waste of money. I enjoyed the special effects, and I settled for watching the film as eye-candy. That worked, just don't expect that the movie will enthrall in the way the Matrix did.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

if you don't want to hear anything about the ending (just to be sure, I haven't read anything and have no idea how it ends) I've left some space.here's some theories
1-neo isn't the 'one' but that kid is, the one who annoys neo and had that animatrix about him (forgot  his name).  If he can succesfully pop himself out of the matrix, then that makes him somewhat more powerful than neo.  It would be cool if the kid learned to enter the matrix without 'plugging in.'  Anway, I loved that animatrix and was pretty mad to see the movie treat him with such little regard.  Neo just wanted to backslap him, it was pretty annoying.2-All of this has been the elaborate training program to make Neo an agent for the matrix.  that would be wonderful, if the brothers had the presense of mind to turn around everything they built and end on such a depressing note, that all along it was just a training simulation to create Agent Anderson.3-We learn what the machines are actually doing with all this energy that they are making from humans.  I mean, they have to have some kind of a civilization, otherwise what would be the point of enslaving all of mankind, there has to be some excess energy.So I think that the machines are creating a virtual society for them to live in, and having realized that they will never understand the human concepts of free-will, they have created a simulation of them as humans, i.e. the Matrix!  haha!  that's a nice one.  All this time everyhuman is just a manifestation of a machine's will, and perhaps just for kicks, the machines have created this rebellious spark.4-At the final scene, on a bridge somewhere looking down into a neverending void, Smith reveals that he is neo's father.  if they do this with completely straight faces, with no suggestion that its ripping off Star Wars, I would forgive the trilogy for all of its pretensions.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

When Neo meets the Architect.  This is the only scene that really advances the storyline.  Before everyone jumps down my neck, I know there is another part coming and some other things will be revealed.  The look of Zion is brilliant, steampunk is cool.  At least half an hour of the film is taken up with useless, excessively long fight scenes brought down this film right from the start.  How many time do we need to see Neo beat up a heap of guys on his own?  I thought the pod race in episode on was more interesting than some of these fights.  We all know he is almost God-like.  The same is true of the chase scene.  To long, with much that wasn't needed.  Even people I have spoken to who have loved the film agree that the one scene NOT needed was the woman in the restaurant eating the cake.  The only reason for the French guy was to allude to those who had come before Neo.  So there is another big amount of time wasted.  And the dance/sex scene.  I can see why it was put in, showing humanities regression to tribal stance etc was WAAAYYYY to long.  And why bother with a sex scene.  The first didn't contain it, in fact, the harshest word said in the first one is s**t. Besides, does anyone else notice that there is absolutely nothing between Neo and Trinity.  No spark at all.

"","","The Matrix Reloaded - The Pinnacle of Misplaced Effort","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0703656/?ref_=tt_urv","fuzzy_nolan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1362647/?ref_=tt_urv","17 May 2003","And I thought the first one failed.  I was wrong.oh so wrong.To quote a line from Bulworth, 'It's amazing how so many people can put so much money and so much time and make something that.just isn't very good.'To tell the truth, I really don't know where to start.  After being disappointed by The Matrix, I was hoping that the Wachowski Brothers would overcome their inadequacies and produce a work of the quality only previously hinted at.  Not only did they repeat the same mistakes, which in itself is hardly surprising, they managed to create totally new ones.Firstly, it appears that the Wachowskis, inflated with their earlier success, upped the special effects ante but forgot to pay someone to look over the script.  Admittedly, the directors had a vision, something that was present even before The Matrix was filmed, of an epic cycle - birth, life, death etc.  The Matrix Reloaded however, was so bloated with cryptic, convoluted dialogue that while sitting in the darkened theatre, I could literally hear the majority of the audience scratching their respective heads.  What is, at heart, a fairly simple story, is complicated by the whims of the Wachowskis.  The Matrix Reloaded is incoherent for much of its running time, and this sort of ridiculousness doesn't wash with an audience. Many of the events are barely strung together in any sort of fashion, in perhaps a vain attempt to excuse the narrative faults by espousing the visual feats.  What I'm assuming is that the Wachowskis were given a carte blanche to bring their entire vision directly to the screen, without anyone willing (or able?) to refine their concepts.  I don't think this is too outlandish a suggestion, after the Wachowskis brought Warner Bros. their biggest hit in the history of the studio in the form of The Matrix.  What we see in the final cut of The Matrix Reloaded is the 'Directors' Cut' which never should have made it to the screen.Also, the blatant symbolism of The Matrix, which I was initially quite scathing of, seems infinitely preferable to the philosophical and religious detritus that litters The Matrix Reloaded.  The former was basically a Christ analogy contained within the philosophical confines of 'the real' and 'the created'.  Its sequel, on the other hand, just seems confused, unsure of where to turn for inspiration.  Some of the major moments - Trinity's (Carrie Anne-Moss) death/salvation, Neo's (Keanu Reeves) stopping the sentinels - seem to be merely lifted from The Matrix and recontextualised. I'd laugh, but then again I paid for my ticket.Another thing that provides both the strongest and weakest moments - also something that's bound to make The Matrix Reloaded a squillion dollar hit - are the special effects.  While 'bullet time' was heralded as a special effects breakthrough several years ago, it's no longer so potent.  When every second shot within any action sequence within the film prominently features the standards - bullet time, shattered glass, the wire work of Yuen Wo-Ping - the effects begin to wear thin.  Case in point: Trinity shooting and falling.and falling and shooting.and shooting and falling.etc.  If the previous sentence makes no sense at the moment, it will when you see the movie.  It's this sort of intensely overwrought, self-conscious special effects that detract from, rather than add to, the film.  The supposedly 'seamless' transitions from the real to virtual actors, while laudable, are still quite noticeable.  I believe the usual practice is to shoot around the shortcomings, rather than put the spotlight on them like The Matrix Reloaded does.  John Gaeta, the visual effects supervisor, publicly stated that it's 'realism, not special effects, that will trick the brain into believing the impossible' and in this respect he's perhaps set his sights a little high. On a bit of a tangent, one special effects moment in the movie - a tracking shot between the Matrixified legs of a beautiful woman - seems more like an expression of the inner Wachowski geek than a legitimate use of special effects to further the narrative.  While writing this though, I've begun to suspect that attacking the special effects is something of a fool's mission and there certainly is something to be said for the technical, if not creative or conceptual, achievements of The Matrix Reloaded.  For the moment though, I'll leave that for someone else to say.Just on the acting side of things - for those brief moments when the character belongs to the actor rather than the animator - much of the cast seems to confuse being cool with brain death.  Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) is the main culprit here, with his Mr. Miyagi act fraying around the edges, although Niobe (Jada Pinkett-Smith) is a strong up and coming contender in this category.  Thankfully, it's not all doom and gloom - the potential for Neo (Keanu Reeves) to become fairly anodyne after the first instalment never eventuates.  Indeed, some of the film's quieter moments rest quite comfortably upon his shoulders.  Some of the bit players also admirably acquit themselves, particularly Merovingian (Lambert Wilson) as a Machiavellian playboy, The Kid (Clayton Watson) as Neo's # 1 fan and Agent Smith v.2.0 (Hugo Weaving) who returns with double the menace. Personally, the charismatic Seraph (Sing Ngai) also made quite an impression in a small role while Persephone (Monica Bellucci) was sadly wasted.On the whole, the failings of The Matrix Reloaded far outnumber the few shining moments.  It appears that $300 million does not a good movie maketh. It's a pity, and a relevant comment on the 'blockbuster' industry that, in spite of these inherent failings, The Matrix Reloaded will still inevitably make a fortune.I'm tempted to voice a hope for The Matrix Revolutions - that the final instalment will be the salvation for blockbusterdom.  Unfortunately, I'm increasingly given to thinking that this is beyond the ability of the Wachowskis.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Matrix had originality, mystery, intense-never-before-seen action sequences and a better musical score. The Wachowski Brothers made a movie that broke boundaries, and that was The Matrix.Four years later The Wachowski Bros follow their action sci-fi masterpiece with one of the cheesiest sequels ever made: The Matrix Reloaded.  Aside from the breathtaking stunts, unbelievable kung-fu fights and the intriguing yet horrifying story, this film screams for an exit.*S P O I L E R S     A H E A D* First off, the acting sucks, straight up.  Agent Smith is the best actor in this film.  Reeves, Fishburne, and Moss act like if they were in a high school play.  Fishburne's Morpheus tries to hard to act cool than being real.  It seems like Morpheus keeps a Dictionary around just to look up some cool words and use them when he is talking to a group.  `Silence, HEAR ME!' How about `SHUT THE F_CK UP!!!'    Reeves reprises every role he has ever played, enough said.  And as for the plain-faced white girl named Carrie-Anne Moss.WHO?!  You know, that white b_tch from the first Matrix movie and Memento.  OH.  It's funny: Moss, Matrix, Memento; how about this one, Makeover. Carrie-Anne isn't right for the part of Trinity, I know it is a little late for that comment but it had to be said.  What were the Wachowski Brothers thinking?  And all the other actors in the movie are all over acting; this includes Pickett-Smith, who didn't have enough scenes in the film and had to make up for it with the video game, which is also bad. Sorry Atari. Even the beautiful Monica decided to through her acting skills out the window with this picture.  ""I want you to kiss me like you would kiss her.""  I have something you could kiss.The editing technique was going smoothly until the train wreck of scenes when 'The Key Maker' is explaining how to `reach the source.'  It seems like they couldn't figure out how to use all of the footage and said `What the hell, just fit it all in there, I don't care how, just do it!'
And as for the film score.  (this is what bothered me the most)  Every effing time some one flew in the air the French horns and Trombones start going ""WHA-wha-WHA-wha.""  Listen to the music next time you see it and you'll notice it.  The acting mixed with the music along with that jumbled last 20 minutes dropped this film from an 8 star movie to a 2 star waste of time.  Hopefully the third one won't suck as much as this one but it probably will considering that they were both made at the same time. Shame on the Wachowski bros, they have elevated themselves to the level of George Lucas, good special effects making up for bad directing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I had heard some not-so-good things about Keanu Reeve's acting, but the thing that helped me to overcome that was the fact that I saw this mainly as an action movie with some story involved. With this type of movie, you don't need to be a great actor to make it work, and I think that if people see this with that in mind, they will enjoy this more. It obviously was not academy award worthy, but then yet again, it doesn't need to be. Just about everything works out in the end, we get some great battle sequences, and some even better slow motion sequences. In the end, it's all fun, although do not ignore the rated R rating. There is quite a lot of violence in this movie, so see it before taking your kids to it. All in all, 9/10 for me.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The dialog drags in a couple of spots.However, I got many visceral, physical reactions watching this film. Chills, tension - gripping the armrest tight, dizziness from the sense of motion even sitting 3rd row from the back; adrenaline rush, heart racing, endorphin rush at the climax of some of the action sequences, laughter.About that laughter: the sound effects were GREAT in this one, hilarious in places. Think ""Three Stooges"", but subtler.  Some may think that would be a non sequitur in what is otherwise such a dramatic film, and that's exactly why it works.  The one-liners are lots of fun too...Agent Smith gets a few of the best ones.  There are some gruesomely cool morphing effects as well, which gave me the creeps every time I saw them.Thinking back to the first Matrix, there wasn't a whole lot of storyline (quality, rather than quantity).  There were major plot points, then a lot of tension and action between those points.  Story wise, I'd like to see them go back to that for the third film and dispense with the too-many undeveloped subplots.  But the new humor and sound effects? Keep 'em! Action, camera work, and special effects?  Stunning, fantastic; absolutely perfect.As for the scenes which remind you of other sci-fi flix, I saw them as tributes to those films.  The one spot where Neo looks computer-generated for about one second may have been on purpose.  If they wanted Keanu's real face visible all the way on that shot, with their resources and technical expertise, they were perfectly capable of doing that. I saw it not as an error, then, but as an interesting special effect.  Of course I could be wrong.  Maybe the filmmakers will weigh in on this at some point.Overall you're in for a wild ride.

I believe there are too many ""Ebert and Rupert"" wannabees trying to sound fancy and criticize the movie.  I saw this last night and loved it.  Fight scenes were great, chase scene was great, Neo vs. Mr. Andersons was GREAT.  Everyone in the theater laughed at the funny stuff, gasped at the tricky stuff and held their breath during most of the fight sequences.  Heck, we even got a handy ""Matrix"" bucket to put our popcorn in.If I had to pick, I still think The Matrix was better than Reloaded, but only by a little and probably because it was new.  My only complaint would have to be the love scene.  It was fine as far as love scenes go but something just didn't fit.  It is as if they thought they had to put a little extra skin on the screen to try to get more people to watch or something.

I don't even think I need to tear it apart, it's hard to watch this movie and not come out saying, 'I couldn't think of a better waste of my time' There's nothing original here. So they have to take out the power, and open the door. So he speaks to the creator of the matrix and is given a choice to save humanity, or trinity, and he goes and saves trinity...

((Not relevant, I just wanted to ruin the ending)) Not to mention it is filled with things that are just utter crap, because he's Neo, he's the one, and in the matrix, he is an omnipotent being. Why can't he simply shut down the power with his mighty 'One' powers? But no, that would ruin the plot and a crappy CGI battle scene with numerous agent smiths","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I had hoped to see something as good or even better then the first film as I had read this movie would explain much about the Matrix itself.This film had little if any plot. The acting if any was horrible. The special effects were great but were there only to fill space for the lack of a story line.If you have to see it wait till it is on the second run so you don't pay full price for the ticket or wait for it on free TV. You will thank yourself for not having to waste your money. This film is so weak and worthless it does not deserve to have the Matrix name associated with it.

The first film had stunning effects and an interesting storyline. The casting was impeccable and the directors borrowed liberally yet with reverence from different genres and motifs. This film feels bigger and more elaborate no doubt due to a megabudget extended thru two films.I will not spoil it but suffice to say this one deals deeper into the meaning of the Matrix and what is real and what is truth. It deals with destiny and premonition, of fate and foreboding. It has a darker feel and there is more at stake. Zion is given great exposure this time and Neo goes deeper into the many facets of the Matrix. And Agent Smith has turned into a nastier villain with some new wrinkles.The special effects are stunning. Are they perfect? NO, but they fit in the overall fabric of the story and the visuals.I plan to see this film again to see if I pick up more and like it more. WARNING:Stay thru the lengthy end credits for a short teaser for Matrix Revolutions which comes in November. Although an R rating, repeat patrons may raise the ante of box office on this one which could challenge X Men 2 . Enjoy!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is our nature to be drawn and compelled to them as they satisfy an innate need to know and understand. The biblical stories are what most of us can relate to.  How different is Neo from the character Moses, a chosen one given divine powers to free the his people? How different is his situation from Noah when faced with the responsibility of repopulating earth after annihilation?  And let's not forget the red pill ""apple"" Neo chose to exile himself from utopia or ignorance. What is the significance of being the 6th one? Was there light on the 'sixth' day?? Does Neo have a brother like Cain and Abel? Happy Easter, Neo has risen from the dead... These are just few of the evident biblical connotations... however these concepts are far from new but it's unique because it's all rolled up into 1 entity.Anyway, (all the other philosophical dialogue aside) is it also seems to incorporate the element of time.  Going back to my previous mention of the big bang, it is also theorized that the universe will one day begin to shrink again into a capsule only to start over again. Are they trying to make a parallel or explain the paradox of the 'creation' of the universe?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

From the start I had been expecting the movie would start soon, a story or a plot would reveal. But the movie continued over meaningless scenes, which was both misleading and a waste of time. A ten-minute sequence of Zion dwellers partying and Neo-Trinity love making was just intolerable.I kept wondering that how can the creators of The Matrix (there was a time I would see it 3 times a day) could even think of generating such a trash, and believe me I felt like shaking those guys up.Till the end the movie showed no reversals. Trash after trash. How can moviemakers assume that jamming up a lot of high-end stunts would sell a movie? People are not that stupid and they are not really blown away by stunts nowadays anyway. Matrix was a unique and well-formulated concept. People went to the theatres to watch its sequel expecting an unpredictable but intriguing mystery. Something for their mind to think about, ponder. We should remember that when we first saw Matrix, we were thoroughly confused by the first scene where a superwoman fights a few police officers. We did not understand what she was doing there or whom was she talking to. We were confused but interested. This build up of interest was very unique experience for me when I saw Matrix. I cant even remember one time when I was interested in the sequel version. All I remember was that I was hoping for the scenes to end.Another point in the movie that is a most important point of any unsuccessful movie is inadequate and sometimes nonexistent character set up. If you show a character in a movie that involves in a dialogue in the spotlight, you cannot afford to let the person leave the stage without explaining his or her character. A number of people entered and left without even leaving a slightest mark on the audience who were totally confused by the lack of meaning to the scenes. My girlfriend was constantly asking me, why was this scene relevant, who is this, who is that. At first I would say that, we might know later...but after sometime I just answered, I don't know. If you compare it with Matrix, where every character was mapped so well that you felt that you know each person by name. Even the agents. There was confusion but there were adequate hints and hidden plots that were revealed when a viewer saw the movie in succession.Overall a very disappointing movie that should remain un-rated. 0 out of 10 would be too generous.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Not because I'm obsessed or deeply moved, as older people might think because I have a young, impressionable mind. I'd rather think it intangible for anyone but me to understand how I really felt about the first. It symbolized everything that I wanted in cinema and felt was lacking: style, substance, a tiny but a strong dose of humor, and a view on philosophy that actually meant more than a couple of sentences uttered by an actor. It shared the same inane sense of intimidation as did Pi and it felt so enjoyable that all I could do was see it again.The original did nothing like this. As the first logo showed up I chuckled and muttered ""this is what I've been waiting for for four years."" Apparently the logos were the best part of the movie, because as the opening scene appeared, I found nothing particularly familiar. We were in a power plant and it meant nothing other than the implied connotation to the power plants of The Matrix. Then the whole Trinity-kicking-people-around scene seemed lethargic and pathetic. In fact, much of the movie was lethargic and pathetic. Even the car chase, though having ONE good shot of the trucks exploding (ruined by Neo's unnatural entry and getaway) was just shot after shot of cars driving and motorcycles riding in different directions. It had no real flying, none of the cars spun out of control and exploded, there was little meaning to that sequence. Knowing the animator who almost single-handedly did the Burly Brawl, I have to pay my respects, but truly what a waste that is. Unnatural, long, boring, drawn out. The dialogue is pulled out of an orifice we all like to mention sometimes and the ""music"" that keeps playing is a total wreck. I am an electronica/hip-hop fan and I actually enjoyed the rock in the first movie though I hated the genre. This collection of tin cans beaten together and somehow mixed with drums would sound better on a cell phone. Oh and all the advertisement and propaganda went straight down the drain. Really dumb and really gullible people will find this intellectual and deep. This is a summer movie, nothing else. And a terrible sequel at that.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's got arguably 3 of the best action sequences of all time, and the car chase scene is the best of its sort of all time.  End of story.

Neo has been freed from the virtual reality computer system, The Matrix, and is now planning with his compatriots from Zion (an underground colony of humans) to destroy the machines. Events are overtaken when it transpires the machines are trying to destroy the humans also. Therefore a race transpires to stop the machines reaching Zion, to save what remains of humanity.Similar to the first film Matrix Reloaded has a blend of incredible actions sequence, but they are much longer than in the first, also a much larger number of ""talkie"" sequences. The plot is relatively complex (none of the people I watched this with understood it fully, other than me). Fans of The Matrix may well like Matrix Reloaded, but there's no guarantee of course due to the differences.There are a lot of negative comments and naysayer's about this second outing for The Matrix. Personally I think a lot of it stems from pessimistic comments. In some sense the first film makes the second film a victim of its success. The first film offered so much originality, perhaps not in plot, but certainly in many other areas that overwhelmed the unoriginal plot. The second film though similar is distinctly different in pace to the original, rather than being evenly toned it tends to vary between long ""talkie"" sequences and equally long action sequences. Many of the pessimistic comments come down to the film action sequences being too long, and equally the overuse of the talkie sequences. Personally I see this from an optimistic point-of-view. The action sequences were so good in The Matrix I didn't want them to stop, and therefore I could gorge myself on those in Matrix Reloaded. The talkie sequences offered a change in pace as well, and some more insight into the developing plot. A lot of pessimistic comments are made about the dialog, and one-liners. I don't think the Wachowski brothers were trying to write a biblical epic here, the dialog is what it is, and I didn't see any prophetic about it, and I didn't need to. So in terms of negative comments, some of the fight sequences don't look quite as sharp as The Matrix 1. That's really the only bad thing I have to say. In terms of story, Matrix Reloaded has more originality than the first but still feels similar to a lot of previous films and other media. The acting is generally better than the first, particularly Keanu Reeves who I found a slightly odd choice the first time round. Of course the movie oozes style and excellent cinematography. The music is perhaps a little more lacking that the first, and it uses a lot less non-original music that the first, replacing it with score. Despite this some of the set action pieces are excellently scored, which balances out the musical problem. In summary a different movie to the first, but equally fantastic. 5/5","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Not as good as the original, but when watched without expectations, this is a pretty good flick.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0705470/?ref_=tt_urv","practiced_bravado","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3166297/?ref_=tt_urv","19 March 2004","I, like most ""Matrix"" fans, was disappointed with this flick. It felt like watching ""The Phantom Menace"" for the first time. I couldn't help but think, ""What the Hell!?"" The original was fresher, more inspired, had a better story, had more groundbreaking action, was less talky and less tacky.Producer Joel Silver had promised the best car chase ever filmed and while it was good, it didn't completely blow my socks off. He also stated that ""Bullet Time"" was going to be taken up to the next level. It didn't seemed so to me, I guess I had just played ""Max Payne"" one too many times.
Maybe ""X2: X-Men United"" had spoiled me a couple of weeks earlier. Director Bryan Singer certainly did improve upon the original ""X-Men"", which was way too short and seemed more like a TV Pilot than a full-fledged motion picture. Singer seemed to be inspired by Steven Spielberg, that's how good ""X2"" was.But, ""Reloaded"", well, what was up with the orgy scene? Or the cheap cliffhanger?  At least ""The Empire Strikes Back"" ended with a grand sweeping camera view as the end came near. ""Reloaded"" ended with a tacky 2-Part TV Episode device: ""TO BE CONCLUDED"". Complete with a bombastic cue of music coming from Don Davis. What???!!What about the deal with the ""Merovingian's"" speech of causality? It ends with a woman, ummm, well, never mind. Then there was the scene with the ""Oracle"" about wanting to understand the reason for making a choice. Then, shortly after, Agent Smith comes in and recites his overlong dialogue about escaping reason and no denying purpose.Did I really want to hear this in a ""Matrix"" movie? Nope, I just wanted to watch an ass-kicking movie with awesome martial-arts and special effects. ""Reloaded"" does have it, but counters it with head-scratching dialogue that seems to make no sense or no place in a picture like this.It's as if the Wachowski's realized they couldn't top the first film and instead, deciced to expand the premise of it with overlong monologues and silly sex segments. Watching it again, I did enjoy it alot more than the first time around, but I still have a problem with the film's pacing. It moves, then drags, it moves, then drags, it moves, then drags.The first ""Matrix"" just sort of flew by (pardon the pun), it strapped you down into a rollar coaster ride with non-stop thrills. Sure, there was exposition, but it moved the story along, not stopped it dead with long speeches we wish we could just delete.Given its flaws, it's not really a bad movie, just uncomparable to the first. The original was direct, to the point, it was about the discovery of a superhero. Its sequel is disjointed, its a little about everything. The nightmares of Trinity, the machines digging, the new Smith, the ""Merovingian"", the ""Architect"", the ""Key Maker"". Everything, but the kitchen sink.I liked the new charcters and their names (which seemed straight out of an ""X-Files"" episode), but I wished the dialogue moved more fluidly. However, judged under its own merits, it's a good, Anime-inspired, sci-fi/action/martial-arts picture that's probably the best of its kind since Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"".Like I said, there's a lot to complain about, but then again, when watched in the right context. As a talky, brainy, sci-fi action flick, it rarely gets better than this. Well, maybe, it does. But still, its good, watch it without any expectations and you'll get a kick out of it. Grade: B+P.S. This movie rocked on the IMAX screen. Anybody who complained about this movie when it was first release, would've had a different opinion of it, due to the audio/visual presentation of this digitally remastered version of the film. If you missed, you missed out on a grand experience.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

More emphasis on the humane and historical aspects could have really grounded the story and lent the sequel the real story depth needed to make it surpass the original.

On my first one I was very critical, but here I'll give it praise. First of all, is this follow-up as good as the original? In a way, yes. I'll say this, it's a very different movie. ""The Matrix"" was a self-contained story about the discovery of a superhero. ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is the first half of a two-part story, the salvation of humanity. It's a setup for the trilogy's conclusion, ""The Matrix Revolutions"", and isn't a watershed movie like the first one was.Like ""The Phantom Meance"", ""Reloaded"" is a very talky film and takes awhile before it seems to move. But when it does, it gets really good. Most of the original cast is back, but their roles have changed a bit. Neo, so confident at the of the first film, is lost at the beginning of this one. He's not sure of himself, although his powers have begun to grow immensely.Morpheus is no longer a mentor, he's more of a prophet this time around. Trinity's role has been reduced from kick-ass warrior woman to the more traditional love interest. Agent Smith is no longer an agent of the system, but he still holds a grudge against Neo and can clone himself at will. Interesting new characters are introduced, but aren't given much screen time.""Bullet-Time"" and the kung-fu, although not as cool as they once were, are an improvement over the original's. Action is not in short supply in this movie, there are a number of scenes that dazzle. The extended highway chase scene is the highlight of the film, but there's also two great martial-art scenes displaying Neo kick major behind. The dialogue may be head scratching, but for the truly devoted, at least it'll prove to be thought-provoking.The climax is actually anti-climactic, a cliffhanger done in the style of a two-part TV episode. It's sudden, but if you've allowed yourself to be taken by the movie, you'll be dying to see the next part. There's some tacky sex stuff, but it shouldn't distract your attention that badly. Overall, this a state-of-the-art, Anime-inspired, sci-fi mix of pseudo-philosophy, kung-fu, video games and comic books. Initially, I was very disappointed by this movie. I wanted it to be another groundbreaking film with fluid storytelling. ""Reloaded"" doesn't have a mind-blowing revelation like the original. It does, however, have a nice twist toward the end. Overall, it's mainly good stuff that towers over crap like ""Charlie Angels: Full Throttle"" and ""Bulletproof Monk"".It's not a great picture, but it is pretty good. I'd give it an enthusiastic thumbs up. *** 1/2 out of ****.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","It's not easy being green!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0705287/?ref_=tt_urv","San Franciscan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0533026/?ref_=tt_urv","19 October 2003","I didn't exactly rush out to see this one because I had been hearing a ton of bad things about it. The fact that I learned that it was being done as two sequels in a row during the same year BACK TO THE FUTURE style--complete with a trailer at the end of the second sequel for the upcoming third one--didn't exactly boost my confidence. So I waited for it to come out on home video. I was an admirer of the first MATRIX movie without being a fan, so the speak, and hoped that the second one wouldn't be just some lousy tack-on.Fortunately, THE MATRIX RELOADED isn't the disaster I feared it would be. Instead of feeling like a ""second movie"", it simply feels like a continuation of the same one the way THE LORD OF THE RINGS does, and that's precisely the way I like it. Sure it's absolutely preposterous at points and has even more unintentionally hysterical lines than the first one (remember the following line from THE MATRIX? ""Never send a man to do a machine's job""? LOL!), but that doesn't mean it's not fun.MATRIX fans would scream foul if I gave away even a smattering of what goes on here away. And I really don't need to; if you've seen the first movie you know the sort of thing to expect. So I'll focus on the stuff I liked and didn't like instead.I wasn't surprised when I learned that the brothers who created THE MATRIX were previously comic book creators--the MATRIX movies are all directed and written like moving comic books, right down to the in-the-air studies and goofy dialogue. The only thing missing during the actions scenes are the ""POW!"" ""BAM!"" action words appearing on screen which I keep expecting to see. These movies are quite possibly the most pure comic-book-feel films out there on the market, as near as I can tell. The direction and feel of them is fascinating to watch, and the frequent slow-motion stops actually *help* you follow the action better that you otherwise might--they add more power and emphasis. THE MATRIX RELOADED, if it's at all possible, is even more enthusiastic than the first one was--and it has the right to be since it's gotten all the story setup out of the way with the first film and now can simply relax and add on from there with this one.The dialogue, as I mentioned, can be downright ridiculous. Morpheus gives what's supposed to be an inspirational speech to a huge crowd that ends up being hilarious as opposed to dramatic, and I can't help but wonder how that poor actor managed to recite that twaddle in that pitch of voice without breaking down in hysterics. And consider the following actual lines from this movie:""You!"" ""Me. Me, me, me."" ""Me, too!""Now honestly; can you imagine someone actually being PAID to write those lines?! :)The action sequences are all superbly staged. I'm not one to go ga-ga over special effects action sequences and it takes a lot to impress me in this day and age when computers and effects can give us anything at all effectwise, but the breathtaking freeway bit *really* impressed me! I also have the sneaky suspicion that the MATRIX creators may be fans of the Disney/Squaresoft PS2 title KINGDOM HEARTS, as THE MATRIX RELOADED even features a battle with a staircased entryway that looks like it's straight out of the Hollow Bastion area where you first fight Riku, only the room is a yellowish-green tint as opposed to royal blue.And speaking of the tint, there's one visual choice here that drives me nuts about this movie. The original movie kept the virtual ""real"" world realistic. In this one, everything in the ""real"" world is shot through a green lens. And I do mean EVERYTHING: even the black on the cop cars is greenish-tinted! Now I know it's an artistic visual choice to remind us that this is supposed to be just all computer graphics and all since the trademark ""glyph graphics"" are bright green, but I personally find that, being an artist, it distracts me from the ""real"" world parts and makes them a lot less convincing and involving than they were in THE MATRIX. I keep thinking I'm looking at the Emerald City out of THE WIZ as opposed to a ""real"" virtual world the way I did in the first movie. It's all so green. Everything green. So green as to almost look plastic-ish, the major guiding art directing rule in those portions is... just... all... GREEN. It's an artistic choice! It's an obsessive compulsive disorder! It's a movie for St. Patrick's Day! It's ALL OF THE ABOVE! ;)Certain questions do come to mind though, even during the action scenes. Such as the twins who are able to suddenly move through substances, which is both an advantage and a hinderance to them (which is ingenious on behalf of the script). One of them appears within a cop car and duing a fight has his arm tied down by a seat belt by Morpheus, which of course begs the question, why didn't the twin simply ""morph"" his way out of the seat belt? Same with the twin who gets his arm caught in the door. That part doesn't make much sense to me. Other than that though, incidentally, the twins do everything but hiss: they're amusing to watch.THE MATRIX RELOADED is like a videogame, but it's sure a fun rollercoaster to watch--certainly better than other ""rollercoaster"" movies like JURASSIC PARK and the like. It has a fascinating backstory to it, and I think that accounts for its success; it works beautifully as an oddly-comforting metaphor for the world we live in, a world where people feel trapped in a reality they are constantly striving to perfect, correct or even ignore.
I've seen several press statements proclaiming this movie to be in the same league as TRON. Nonsense. TRON was a very special movie, the type that only gets made once in a lifetime and approached the idea of a computer world with a staggering poetry, beauty and wistful depth to it that moved the heart and soul as well as the eye. You walked out of the theatre feeling shaken and somehow transformed. That film was groundbreaking, original and a spectacular experience... it still is. THE MATRIX will leave your mind spinning with its weird idea of the real world not really being real and its overall strangeness to toy with, and yes that is a lot of fun, but even that doesn't compare to the loveliness that is TRON. The two are simply not in the same league. TRON is the deeper movie and far more successful in using computers to express the humanity within us all. THE MATRIX is most definitely an action flick designed to provide thrills and gasps as opposed to revelations and emotions.As a story, THE MATRIX does a good job of reminding us of various things important to existance, especially as it grabs at Biblical references left and right, but even so it still only offers so much. So don't go in expecting anything but a fun mindbending videogame and you'll enjoy yourself. Like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, it's a film that's fun to mentally toy with, a Rubik's cube for the senses. And it's certainly nowhere near the disaster that I've read a lot of press statements to find it to be. I enjoyed it, and I think you might too.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It has all the look and style of the original. The action scenes are longer and more spectacular. It's only problem, it's a sequel.Part of the reason sequels are always inferior to the original (Godfather 2 excepted) is familiarity. The concept of the original was something engaging, it immediately grabs your attention. This is not an ordinary sci fi film. Reloaded assumes (probably correctly) that all it's viewers will have seen the original. So the premise of the film is no longer new and fascinating. This is ofcourse not the fault of the film makers, it's an inherent problem with sequels. What is the fault of the film makers is the weaker storyline.The original followed Reeves from his journey from Anderson, to being ""the One"". It's starts off in our every day western reality, and takes us on a journey through an alternate reality and ends in a place we've never been before. Reloaded starts in a place we have been before (in the original), and ends there. Neo no longer develops as a character, he starts the film as a super human, and goes about doing cool super human stuff. The super hero that saves the human race, now there's a concept we are all too familiar with.If you loved the original for its effects and action scenes, you will probably like this one even better. If you loved the original for it's storyline, then you will be a little let down. But it's still well worth seeing, there's a whole lot worse movies out there.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'm a huge fan of the original Matrix and when I heard they were making not only one sequel but a trilogy I was thrilled... I loved the first and I couldn't wait for more.Then I saw the trailer for Reloaded! It looked AMAZING!!! And the hype was out of this world. So I kept one thing in mind: A movie that looks this great and generates incredibly high expectations can only disappoint. So I anchored my expectations. Little did I know how low I should have kept them.
The original film mixed excellent fight choreography with a Terminator style plot (Machines take over the world and one man is sought after to lead a fight against them) with a fun touch of Zen dialogue (""There is no spoon""). But, unfortunately, once the movie became such a phenomenon and developed such a huge following it seems as if the film makers decided that what followed should be much more ""epic"" (i.e.; pretentious). What they succeeded in doing is making the film much more boring... there is waaay too much technical computer jargon and that fun touch of Zen dialogue in the original is over the top in this one. Almost every time a character spoke in this film I felt like yelling ""SHUT THE F*CK UP!!!!"". But, fortunately, this film sports some of the best action scenes ever filmed (the extended car chase scene is amazing), although the scene where Neo is attacked by all the Smith clones goes on far too long. Also, I know this is a trilogy and is ""to be concluded"", but couldn't the makers have found a better point to end the film... they should have taken notes from Peter Jackson in the way he ends his Lord of the Rings films... Reloaded's ending just felt awkward. Overall I'd say the film is ""incredibly average"". I say this only because of my expectations and my love of the original. Hopefully, they'll tone down the pretention in Revolutions (although judging by the title and the fact that it's the conclusion, I doubt it).6 out of 10 for the action scenes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Yep.Here are some reasons why: Reloaded won't redefine your personal relationship in terms of Neo & Trinities deep, predestined love. (Ok, the first movie probably didn't do that either.) It won't inspire you to question authority with the same attitude Neo does when he gives Agent Smith the finger. (Reloaded is a movie that contains WITHIN THE MOVIE billboard marketing ads from Samsung & Powerade). And it won't make you question your existence in the same profound way the original Matrix did. (Admit it, you freaked out.) But hey, sometimes you can appreciate a movie just for fun, right? (And not for its horrifying philosophical truths.)That being said, I liked the Matrix Reloaded.The special effects are truly amazing, yes, and everyone's favorite characters are back: Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, Agent Smith. (Although all of the new characters suck, but I'll get to that later. (Why do I keep using parenthesis?)) There is a lot of 'food for thought' if you are hungry for A.I., futuristic technology, situations in the Matrix which expose the nature of man in the universe, and characters speaking their opinions on the problem of free will choice vs. scientific determinism, characters displaying the meaning of love, hope, resilience, etc.. And the fight scenes. Absolutely. amazing.But despite keeping to the basics of the original The Matrix (Kung Fu gunfights spliced together with scenes from 'the real world' with the occasional conversation about fate vs. free will) Reloaded somehow has a different tone There was something special about Neo's journey in the first Matrix that wasn't lived up to in the sequel. Instead, there are lots of new characters, and a techno-orgy-rave. Introducing a new character every few minutes comes at the cost of developing the old ones, and developing their relationships to one another. The heavy contrast between humans and the machines is no longer there, which factors into the whole idea of peace/convergence that the movie promotes, but for whatever reason, I don't like that. OK. I admit I was a bit disappointed when I saw Reloaded in theaters back in 2003, but thats only because I had such high expectations. But now I just enjoy it for what it is. Not a 10/10 movie. But definitely a 7 or an 8.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Bombs bursting here, Uzi's bursting there and the biggest surprise Keanu has learned to act.Reloaded picks up where The Matrix left off.  A group of Freedom Fighters, led by Morpheus, played by Laurence Fishburn, continue their assault against the machines that have enslaved the Human Race in The Matrix. This time we get a glimpse of Zion, the last free human city. We meet a cast of new characters including Jada Pinkett-Smith as Niobi, and Link, played by Harold Perrineau Jr., who pilot's Morpheus's ship the biblically named Nebecanezzer.  Plus, Neo played by Keanu Reeves and Trinity played by Carrie Ann-Moss, are back and this time around the movie centers on their budding romance. There is a story here, a good one in fact, but it would take a book to explain, so lets move on. What I can tell you is there is a fantastic chase scene that takes up most of the second act, and boy is it cool.  Cars flipping, trucks crashing, Motorcycles jumping here and there.  It's a high-octane rush.  All brilliantly choreographed almost like ballet.  It end on a perfect note, with a spectacular shot I won't even begin to describe cause it's worth the price of admission.Now comes the part of the review I hate, that moment when I have to mention what I disliked about the film.  There is a scene early in the film, where Neo and Trinity consummate their love.  The scene plays out longer than necessary, and really stops the story dead in its tracks.  We get the point 3 minutes before it's over and I a serious blight to the film.  I mention this scene to tell parents to keep young children and teenagers away from this film.  It's fun for it's target audience 17 and up The Matrix Re-Loaded earns it's R rating.This is the Best Blockbuster Popcorn Flick I've seen all year.   If you do decide to see the Matrix Re-Loaded do me two favors, 1) If you haven't seen the first one in a while rent it cause you'll be lost and 2) Stay 'til the very end of the credits and you'll be treated to a short trailer for The Matrix Revolutions due out this November.On a Scale of 1-5 I give this Bad Boy ****1/2.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

For a movie with such an intelligent prequel, this film entered ""cater to the masses"" with aplomb.  You'll waste around a third of your movie-going experience with gratuitous see-thru rave-inspired orgy-type freak dancing and a nice double helping of unnecessary sex crowned with a very inspiring shot of Keanu's bare derriere.  If you've been missing out on the cultish feel, you'll get a nice treatment of that as well.  Once we've passed this less-than-glorious phase, we move on to the action.  The overly-CG'd cheezed up action.  Borrowing a page from the once-brilliant George Lucas, the Matrix wizards have thrown more computerized crap in here than you can shake a stick at.  The action scenes feel like a high-end video game less than a movie.  The multiple Agent Smiths was a nice idea, but the requisite CG made it cartoony at best.  Smith's character was uninspiring this time around as well.  Apparently there's only enough personality for one, so they just spread it amongst the flock.  The depth and feeling of the original Smith is just not here.  Failure not from Hugo Weaving but from The Wachowski Brothers' poor writing.  Tie it all up with a plot twist at the end that leaves you screaming ""Thirteenth Floor! ExistenZ! Unoriginal HACKS!"" and you've got the biggest disappointment so far this year.  Go see it.  Just don't expect much.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I thought the first film was good, and I own it on DVD, but if it wasn't for the bullit-time sequences and the big budget action, it would have just been an episode of The Twilight Zone. The whole concept of virtual reality and characters not being sure of what the real world is, has been covered countless number of times in episodes of The Outer Limits, Star Trek, The X-files, and there was even episodes of The New Adventures of Superman and Red Dwarf that covered similar territories many years ago, so I really dont give The Matrix credit for originality. Its a pastiche of various sci-fi from The Terminator to William Gibson. (The name ""The Matrix"" was lifted straight out of Gibsons ""Neuromancer"")However The Matrix was an enjoyable film overall, and I do feel that Reloaded is an enjoyable follow up. If anything, I think the world of The Matrix is more dynamic now thanks to Reloaded.I found Agent Smith much more interesting and much more unique as a ""disconnected"" agent with the ability to replicate himself. He seemed to have much more of a personal identity in Reloaded, and the revelations with The Architect had me competely gripped, not to mention that the film revealed much more about The Matrix itself, and started probing some of the actual mechanics of it. But generally speaking, it expanded upon things with Zion and the counsel, and seeing Neo and Morpheous fight side by side gave the film a warmer touch.Overall, I dont see what was so great from the first film that wasn't in the second film. The philosophy is all there, the action is all there, the characters have progressed, and it managed to expand upon the general story, so whats the problem??","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Thought on THE MATRIX RELOADED: THE IMAX EXPERIENCE","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0705170/?ref_=tt_urv","Pasafist","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0054462/?ref_=tt_urv","11 August 2003","I don't know who invented the tracking shot.  But I do know that IMAX re-invented it.   When you go to an average movie theater you sit down for a mostly passive experience.  But with IMAX you body is immersed in a movie. I've seen a few of the beautiful nature films and sweeping films about far off planets that IMAX has brought us.  But nothing prepared me for THE MATRIX RELOADED THE IMAX EXPERIENCE.If you've seen this film on the smaller movie screen and you liked it.  I guarantee you'll like it even more on the IMAX screen.  Great sequences are even better.  The details are magnified, and the computer-generated effects are much clearer.  But the best part is how as the camera tracks around the various scenes and your body moves with them.As the film opens, you are actually drawn into the Matrix.  As the camera sweeps between and in and out of that green programming code, you body feels the motion.  It's breath taking.  It's a feeling you can't have at you're local Loews.  The best scene to utilize the IMAX is the scene in which NEO is fighting the hundred Agent Smiths.  When he leaps up into the air and back into the crowd of Smith's your heart jumps.  As he swings the street pole around his head, your head moves along with the motion.   There is also a great moment when Agent Smith and Neo fly into a wall.  As they bang into it, they actually hit the screen with a huge crack.  You feel like it's almost hit you.  It's amazing.While many have argued that this film is a terrible movie.  I think for once, they missed the point. Yes, RELOADED is full of long drawn out exposition scenes.  Scenes in which characters discuss computer lingo, and programming glitches, as well as Gnostic and, Eastern Philosophies, and while many had problems with that.  I had not one problem with them. (For the record the mass orgy scene fails on every count and is a major flaw in the film)  They do what they are designed to do, that is to offer a lot to think about, or maybe nothing at all.  At the end of the day and after thousands of scholarly papers are written on the subject.  It doesn't matter, nor should it.  I don't think THE MATRIX will save the word or be an important film but it will always be lots of fun.Personally I also found the movie has a high replay value. It has lots of little moments and nuances that you miss the first time.  It's also fun to put the pieces together, all the plot points that went over your head the first time.I also gained an appreciation for the supporting cast.  Especially Lambert Wilson as Merovingian, his speech on second viewing is really funny.  It's such a small role and he has such a good time with it.
I really hope that THE MATRIX: REVOLUTIONS pulls no punches and ups the ante.  I hope that many if not all the ideas that surround THE MATRIX are made a little clearer.  Because of course that can only strengthen the film series as a whole.  But I also hope the film keeps it's sense of fun (I heard on a police radio during the freeway scene a cop calling, saying he was ADAM-12That Made Me Smile).If you didn't like the film, I still recommend THE IMAX EXPERIENCE.

I understand why people are complaining about the lack of story, and the rather abrupt ending, however, if you listen to all the exposition, you have a chance of understanding.I will definitely see it again, because it has some truly exceptional scenes, however some of the CG in the Burly Brawl (that is where Neo is in the courtyard with the 100 Smiths) is a bit fake.The car chase is total madness, and Neo truly becomes Superman. There are a lot of laughs, and those Wachowski Brothers have a wicked sense of humour! (Watch out for the 'cake scene' in the Restaurant!)When you see it stay alert because a lot of important stuff is happening all the time. Anyway, enjoy it for what it is and don't let any one influence you if they say it is rubbish.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And i would say yes it was an entertaining movie, however i was expecting more.  To me the whole thing seemed a vessel for the action scenes.  My biggest problem was the rave, that was pretty uncalled for i think.Also where did Trinity get two uzi's when she walked in there unarmed in a skin tight body suit.  And dont say she got them off the guards because guards dont carry uzi's.  It was the little things like this that really took away from the movie for me.  Another thing was the Keymaker, when on the back of the motorcycle is casually resting his hands on Trinities thighs.  Would a little scared guy have his arms wrapped around her waist to hold on, hell wouldnt even a non scared guy do it just for better balance when she is doing all that crazy stuff?The last thing was Neos choice, the (If you havent seen the movie you probably shouldnt read this.) Left door.  Wasnt the whole matrix exploding behind him, cause wasnt that what the left door did?  How did he have time for his touching moment with dying Trinity on the roof top?
I say it was entertaining dispite my dislikes of certain things but i still expected more.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie was more about action;it seemed that the goal was to make everything bigger, faster and more exciting visually rather than to make the storyline more intriguing.  I even found myself laughing at some of the action scenes such as the one where Keanu fights the multitude of Hugo Weavings by going vertical on a steel pole and basically running along all the Weavings as they surrounded the pole in a circle. That's the kind of thing I'd expect to see in a PARODY of The Matrix!  I hated that I could clearly see which scenes were CGI- I sometimes felt that I was watching a video game where a too-smooth, perfect-looking Neo was battling too-smooth, perfect-looking enemies.

I guess enough is never enough when it comes to money, but try or at least pretend trying earning this money.  I am referring to Wachowski brothers who are proudly standing newt to George Lucas. I grew up with the first Star Wars trilogy and I really liked the first Matrix, but now I feel, to put it mildly, as I have been taken advantage of. Anyway, it's not something that wont let me sleep at night. Let's stick to the Matrix Reloaded and its beauty.The first thing that comes to my mind is the emotional and devoted play by Keanu Reeves. I don't know how much money he makes for this trilogy, but obviously is not enough. Speaking of him reminds me of somebody's bright idea to turn Reeves into Reeve. Wasn't that cool or what? But let's omit the details. The next big moment was the fight with the Smiths half of which went off under the motto: buy the game `Enter the Matrix"". Another flash on somebody's mind was the idea of putting a human face on one of the most dangerous programs-the Merovingian. Even for such a tough outlasting total of five Neos program nothing can replace a good old human b*** job inside the lady's room. Being such sophisticated one comes at hand: he can program a virtual Viagra for women. Wasn't that cool or what? But how else we are going to make his wife (supposedly similar program) jealous?!?!? which produces on of the best lines in the movie. Wanting to be kissed by Neo in order to sample something forgotten, Persephone gets a Trinity's gun point at her face accompanied by the words: why don't you sample this instead. Great line from a great woman. Speaking of sophisticated programs I wonder who code that English twins to shoot in such a way making the car look like a strainer and yet not even scratching the main target(s). I guess in their haste they must've switched places-the killer got the steering wheel and the driver ended up with the machinegun. I think that's enough. I was thinking to tell you about the powerful speech given by Morpheus and the following techno party in honor of the digging machines. And of course the architect with his divine answers ergo, some of his answers we could understand, and some of them we couldn't. But that's OK, he warned us-we are irrevocably human.My advice is, watch it once. I was stupid enough to see it few times thinking that it will be like the first one  better with every viewing. And you could see the result.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Will it live up to the standards you set after seeing the first film?  Depends on what you liked about the first film.Reloaded is the Empire Strikes Back to The Matrix's Star Wars.  Think about the difference between Star Wars and Empire.  Star Wars could stand alone. It had a definite beginning and end.  So did The Matrix.  Empire Strikes Back had much less action and much more philisophical mysticism; Luke spent most his time with Yoda, Han and Leia spent a large amount of time on an asteroid flirting instead of shooting things.  Empire didn't end cleanly; clearly, there was more to the story.  I won't give away any of the plot of The Matrix Reloaded, but it definitely is much more of an Empire Strikes Back than a Star Wars.So will you like this film?  If you thought the first film was the coolest action film you ever saw, if you want more kung fu, more near-miss escapes, more daring rescues, then this film definitely has that.  If you want attractive actors who look even hotter when they are in the matrix, that is here too.  Explosions, chases, cool special effects; oh yeah.  But that stuff is mixed in with lots and lots of talk.  LOTS.  And most of that talk is about stuff that might make more sense to you if you have a degree in Philosophy, with double-minors in Programming and Political Science.So if you found the philosophical side of the first film interesting, then this will be even more interesting.  If you like comic books, you'll probably love this movie as much as the first one; so many comic-ready poses, so little time!  If you like Stanley Kubrick films, with the color themes and the lengthy silences, then you will definitely enjoy Reloaded. If LAN parties are a part of your social life, you will like this film.But if you just want one action scene after the other, with more fighting and less thinking, you might be a bit disappointed.And if you are the girlfriend of a sci-fi boy who didn't really get the first movie, please, please stay at home.  Or at least leave your cell phone at home.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Period.  Tons of actions (a lot, much, gratuitous etc.) Perhaps a tad much considering it was mostly just more of the same from the first one.  I however really loved the last half of the movie, where the story started to develop and where a little more attention and intelligence than one would expect was required to grasp all that was going on.  Including the timeline being split into 3 simultaneously.  The scenes in Zion were almost pointless except for the meeting with the counselor and Morpheus' speech, as with the love scene with trinity.  It seemed to me that the nature of the relationship between Neo and Trinity was one that was based on unrequited love, and would have added a tragic element to the subplot. The whole agent smith (my fav character from the first one) sub plot and fight scene was over played and not really necessary for the plot unfortunately, but the revelation of the nature of the oracle, the matrix, the anomaly, and Zion was just as I thought it should be.  Funnily enough I had thought that was the direction the series had to take in order to make it worth watching the third.  As well the film really leaves one hanging, I cant wait for the third installment!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The second time wasn't by choice, but that's ok... it allowed me to truly evaluate the film. I have to give it credit for some incredible fight scenes, but detract for being too self-involved and 'wordy' in trying to be a deeply philosophical film.  I found myself looking at my watch whenever (2) scenes (if you've seen the movie, you know which ones) were playing and actually during my first viewing using the first drawn out scene as an excuse to go make a pitstop.  When I saw the movie the second time on 5/23 I was able to watch the partial scene I missed and realized I hadn't missed anything.  I will though have to see the last installment, just to see how it ends.  I give it 6/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The action scenes are technically interesting, but way, way too long. The notorious Agent Smith fight descends into a farce as quickly as it descends into sub-'Jurassic Park' quality CGI.As the fight scenes came on thicker and faster I just wanted to whizz through them. It seemed that the scene near the end of the film where Neo meets a critical new character was the only genuine item of interest on offer. This film could have been fifteen minutes long.
The car chase scene was visually impressive but not emotionally engaging. I suppose that pretty much sums up my whole viewing experience. I'm just so glad that I didn't pay to see it.I wouldn't say 'avoid at all costs', but if you watch it don't expect much and have the remote control handy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I came out of the movie giddy as hell, but had some niggling doubts. Basically, the movie has some amazing ideas and scenes, but is severely lacking in several ways.In terms of the expression of the themes, its clumsy and too blunt. Conversation seems contrived, and the tone is too light and clean in many places. Plus the main section in Zion is bland and slow, when the information provided in these scenes could have been woven into the movie gradually, as was done in the first movie, where exposition was part of the development of the story and Neo's character arc. The storytelling in the first Matrix was masterful ,and that is where this movie falls down.That said, the action in this movie is great, the Burly Brawl was crazy exciting, despite a comical tone and the lack of danger and intensity; its brilliant in a way that feels totally out of place in a Matrix film. The final fight in Revolutions is much truer to the series.The ideas in this movie are also inspired. The whole reversal of the mythology towards the end is GENIUS, and the Architect is great. Neo's personality being displayed on the monitors is brilliant, I just love that scene in general.As a continuation of the first movie, it wasn't absolutely necessary, but i love where the story went, despite some bland, and in places clumsy, telling of it...","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"". When Matrix first got out people didn't quite had any ideea about what's with this movie and I personally thought that is just another SF Bull-S***. I saw it later on on HBO the first time and I was speechless at the end of it and thinking "" Hell yeah ... that no spoon thing is the s*** "" and I saw it times and times again enjoyn every second and got to consider it the movie for my soul if you know what Im saying... You pretty much get how much I just loved it. But then I found out they wore making 2 more parts and I thought to myself "" What more can they show ?"" and waited for this RELOADED part like crazy. And it finnaly got out with tones and tones of commercials comparing to the first part and now everyone knew about the movie ( even those who haven't watched the first part or knew about his existence ), so everyone was digging Matrix now. But I after I saw it I could not BELIEVE it ... I was thinking ""is this a joke ?"". Have I seen another movie or am I dreaming ?? I was so dissapointed... Don't get me wrong now ... I was sitting in the cinema's chair and almost burts into tears when I saw the Special Effects and all but the story line was going down and down starting to suck my every minute of the movie. Ok I pushed my limits as far as possible when watching Neo fighting all those agents and I was thinking ""Ok this is the worst part and the movie is gonna kick ass from now on"" but it HAD NOT. It got worst. When I saw Neo flying like Superman I couldn't believe it but the moment when he brought Trinity back to life said it ALL. Of course the talks he had with The Oracle and The Architect or so cool but if they couldn't make me enjoy the movie after the parts with the fight and Trinity. It was god damn brilliant with the jumping from the building in the first part and the bullet doggin stuff which wore all related to the ""Don't think you are, know you are !!"" part which was the key to the whole movie but those parts ... COME ON GET REAL ... Could they have made it more comercial than that ?So I hated them for making Matrix ( which was the greatest film/concept of all times - a masterpiece of cinematography if you want ) look like a money making fountain with this RELOADED part.But the The Revolutions came out and I wasn't all that looking into going like with the Reloaded but I saw it 2 weeks ago and I must say it was way better than I excpected ( maybe because Reloaded suked so bad ). It's easy to see that in this 3rd part they tried to get back to the 1st part ""feeling"" and all the phylosophy but they wore a little too late. I have respect for the producers that tryed with this 3rd part to REVOLUTIONISE the concept and fix the crap they pulled down into the Reloaded part. A good movie but not as good as the first one of course so my top is 1. THE MATRIX 2. REVOLUTIONS 3. RELOADED ( deffinatly is not worthy of staying near those two :))","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","The Matrix Reloaded? Or matrix unloaded?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704927/?ref_=tt_urv","aces_high_4","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2382025/?ref_=tt_urv","10 June 2003","The film revolves more around the city of Zion this time rather than freeing minds from the matrix. The machines are digging down the city of the humans, and it seems again that only the ONE can save the day. Neo has to go in the matrix and do an assortment of things to get in to the matrix mainframe and disable the machines. I will say no more on the story line, so not to spoil it for you.If you were to discuss what this film had, you would have to say it had it all. It had romance, Extreme action, fast bikes, faster cars, guns, sex and suspense. The only thing it missed was a point. You watch the entire film and then the explanation of what has been going on for the past 2 hours is a load of jargon that you will have to be an English, and mathematics major to even get the gist of. The best advice I can offer you is 'take a dictionary' because no normal person will understand a word. Don't pay for someone else's ticket for this film because you will need that additional fee to pay for yourself to see it again. If you think you will be able to watch this once and fully understand it you will be horribly wrong, you will have to go back about 4 times to understand it all. Anyone that says otherwise is LYING to you!As usual Keanu Reeves (Neo) is as cool as ever and kitted out in his new agent killing gear, and Laurence Fishburne is acting as if he is the legendary Morpheus and making a very good job of it. All the agents make a return, even the very controversial 'Agent Smith' who we all thought was the first to fall after Neo discovered he was the ONE makes a return. In a big way!The fight and action scenes were, as you would expect, breathtaking. However I feel the makers will have to think of something a little different for the third instalment of the series to keep the interest still there. You watch the first matrix and think 'God!! This is unbelievable' but you watch this and feel its just the same old style of fighting over and over again, and no amount of special effects will be able to change that. I feel that too many enemies were added which in the long run, made great action scenes but very hard to keep up with. The only problem is that the fighting scenes do at some point's flaw the films story line. At one point Neo is struggling to keep up with fighting some of his enemies, and the next he is flying at the speed that has never been seen before by the ships new navigator. I just wish they would make up their minds about how fast Neo really is.As for the special effects, they were up to the sort of standard that we have come to expect from the big blockbusters of the modern day. It was full of explosions and a very good scene when Morpheus and crew are fighting agents on the high way, at extreme speeds.When I was watching this film I thought to my self 'I wish I was a woman so I could enjoy this film more'. Not being sexist, it's proven that women like Romance more than men, and this was a little over done in the romance department. Obviously this film had romance written all over it after what happened at the end of the first film. However, it has been layered on far to think.The Matrix was probably one of the best films made. It had the best fighting scenes, the greatest special effects ever seen to that time, and a truly unforgettable story line.  But Sorry I have to say that the matrix: Reloaded was definitely more like Matrix: Unloaded and was no where near the high standards of the original. However, there is still life left in the series yet, with the 3rd and final instalment coming some time later this year. When you read a good book it always has a beginning, middle and end. Sometimes though, not all of the 3 sections are great, but the book is still a work of genius. So basically what I'm trying to say is, if the 3rd part of the series is anywhere near as good as the first, it will go down in my mind as one on the best films ever made.My Rating 7/10 'Definitely worth going to see, but compared to the original, it lacks in the story line'Final Comments This could and should have been the best film ever made, but I don't even rate this as film of the year. It's not that bad, it just is a disappointment after the first film, and all the media hype that this film was given. My tip for the rest of this year is 'we have had two of the four biggest films of this year so far which are X-men 2 and Matrix: Reloaded. However I feel the ones to watch this year will be Terminator 3, and the newest conversion of the marvel comics, The Hulk. Watch this space!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

When seeing the first film millions of times I never would have guessed that zion had such a huge part to play in the sequels. But it does. The wachowskis have tried to fit too much into this. The way I see it revoltions and return of the king aren't gonna be that different. Both have one saviour against a force of evil to help protect and save a place full of innocents eg zion and middle earth respectively. So when return of the king is out we will care about the crisis of middlearth cause it was so well developed in the first LOTR film. In revolutions (which is essentially about the fate of zion) no one will care because its been underdeveloped in MR. Maybe if the bloppoksis made it into a 4 part series and concentarted the second film on zion and made us care about it, then it would work, but it dont. Secondly if you go watch the first film now, despite being far better than this one, it sucks, because MR contradicts everything in it rather than developing its themes and plot points. It seems like a waste of time now and seeing them all back to back wont work either. I think that the bllopkiss have focused too much time on elaborate special effects, f***ing with out minds, kung fu, and that whole 'surprise factor' instead of making us care about the last human city on earth, which, ironically, are arguably the most rushed scenes in the film, when they should have been handled with the most amount of care. I'm not too sure if the film itself is to blame, more to do with the general approach of scriptwriting and the level and direction that the blposkis have decided to take the matrix story to (if that makes sense). It's as though both films were adapated from novels and the first one was filmable (as it had a linear narrative) but the second one wasn't, if you dig. Great SFX though (DUH!!).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Keanu is much more confident in his moves, and he looks so smooth and sharp in every scene. The Neo-Trinity relationship is extremely comfortable and they ooze chemistry. A great pairing.As usual, the ramblings by Morpheus and new characters can be distracting but that is the beauty of the film. We aren't meant to understand everything and yes, there is more to come.Much is already known about the fight scene between Neo and Agent Smith who duplicates ten-fold....on screen, it is stunning. Breathtaking and seemless, and honestly has that wow factor. Also, the huge highway section. Woah...Trinity has a blast here and I had people next to me in the theatre moving and dodging traffic in their seats as she stormed through traffic.I could go on and on but I won't....yes this is big-budget, yes we may have lost that 'sleeper' feel but every penny spent has been well worth it.

No wonder so many people hated it, unless you can understand the story your screwed. But once the story clicks then you really start to understand the film and appreciate that it is in fact more than a worthy sequil when you understand it this film will help you to understand the intricusy of the trilogy and that what is in the mind of its directors is something so wonderfull you cant help but stand in awe of it","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But this plot is a little less confusing than that of THE MATRIX. Anything that involves less work from my brain is good for me.Second, more action. THE MATRIX had some good action scenes, but THE MATRIX RELOADED's action scenes blows those out of the water. The scene where Neo fights the Agent Smith clones and they just keep on coming, and the car chase on the highway are definite standouts. Those two scenes are just amazing. I'll admit, THE MATRIX was a little boring for me. THE MATRIX RELOADED held my interest the whole way through.My sentiment is definitely not going to be that of everybody. But my personal opinion is that THE MATRIX RELOADED is even better than the original, because it is less confusing and with much more action. You won't want to miss it. But, of course, you have to see THE MATRIX first. 9 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Admittedly, much of the criticism of this film seems to come from those who have never read a book in their lives, or had something close to an adult relationship. I am proud to say I saw this film five times in theatres before it came to DVD. I was greatly impressed with the film for a number of reasons. The story arc itself is very much rooted in Shakespeare. It is always darkest before the dawn: Do not be surprised if the ending will disappoint those raised only on a steady diet of science fantasy films or Disney pictures. This is science fiction in the grand tradition of Asimov and Bradbury, full of allegorical twists. This is philosophy derived from Plato's Republic, and even nightmarish future visions courtesy of Orwell. (Trust me, the references to the number 101 are not about binary code.) I have found that people who criticize this film have no understanding of not only these authors, but also no understanding of science, physics or mathematics. The story confuses them because it is just completely over their heads. Additionally, the geeks who saw this film as many times (or more) than I did are completely lost not only on the origins of the Persephone and Merovingian characters, but their importance in relation to the other characters lives. This is a film geared toward adults; naturally, the characters do not act two-dimensionally or in a ""traditional"" manner. Ask anyone who has been in a love triangle and let them try to explain the dynamics of something that is not totally black and white but all gray. My philosophy is this: if you can't grow up and use the big boy voice, sit at the kiddies table and watch another Star Wars film. That will leave us with a little more maturity to enjoy this film for what it is: brilliant but flawed, just like life, just like love.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This sequel contains concepts that extend the mythos created in the first movie.Comparing this one to the original you have to admire the lean and mean original. The Matrix Reloaded suffers in comparison.  It contains sequences which could be easily shortened and provide for a better viewing experience.There are 2 main areas where the Matrix Reloaded stumbles: 1) Too many sequences of tell and not show.2) Fight sequences that are not incorporated into or advance the story.There are far too many scenes where the audience has to sit and listen to someone lecture us on what the movie is about.  These scenes should have been presented in a manner where the cast was actively involved in discovering what they were being told.Fight sequences like the Tea House and the Burly Brawl went on too long or were not needed for the plot.  The Tea House brawl occurs because Neo is told by the Seraph that he can only be sure of who Neo is by fighting him?!? Sorry that's a pretty weak explanation for a gratuitous fight sequence.The Burly Brawl, while technically impressive, enters into cartoonland when Smith snarls, ""MORE!"" and the screen proceeds to fill with more Smiths. From this point on the CGI work is quite obvious and is not enough of a novelty to keep the audience's interest.All the fight sequences in the original Matrix had some investment in the plot line.The sad fact is that the W. brothers fell prey to excess with their expanded budgets.On the plus side the flying sequences were well done and the highway chase set a new standard.This is a solid movie but not a special movie.Often less is more.  Witness the original Matrix.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If we really ask ourselves what good film making is, the Matrix fails in every aspect. The acting is quiet honestly the worst I've seen in years - obviously encouraged by the rather detached and always lifeless performance of Keanu Reeves. The story is rather boring and at times too complicated to follow, not because of the concept or idea of the Matrix, but because the dialogue is often filled with unnecessary phrases that try to bring some depth into the overall theme. Then again, it seems like the rules of acting don't really apply to this film. The rules of cinematography also go down the drain since the movie is mostly animated.
What is comes down to is what we always feared - machines take over humanity and the making of this movie is, as absurd as it might seem,  the perfect example. There is no need for real characters or actors. 3d Software created the only impressive part about this movie and is therefore a 3d adventure-ride in Disney-Land. If I would have had a joystick in front of me it could have been a cool computer game as well.
So what's good filmmaking? - I think we forgot. Go watch the movie for the effects, not for anything else that might be interesting about filmmaking.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Like with SW's vast world of CG, we're immediately wowed by the crazy physics-defying battles within the Matrix, but it's not too long before you find yourself sitting there saying, `Okay, feel free to end the fight any time soon.'  You can only see Neo slam Smith into a wall (or vice versa) so many times, and too much bullet time gets annoying.Definitely a fun film to watch, but not something you'd want to dive too deeply into and certainly the last film you'd want to get philosophical about.  When said fights and special effects are gone, there's really not much left holding up the movie.  I mean, the character development for Trinity amounts to her nice shiny black outfit and funny catch phrases from time to time.  Not the fault of Moss, either the writers failed to give her character anything to work with or the material was cut in favor of dragging out the highway battle.Neo had some nice character development in the first Matrix film, though that's more attributed to the fact Neo is the point of the whole plot. But in Reloaded, his character develops as the plot demands it . . . specifically in the final thirty minutes of the film when we start moving somewhere again at a reasonable pacing.  It would be nice to see Neo continue to grow with his ability instead of making him a demi-God at the start of this movie who really doesn't budge until the final few minutes of the film.Morpheus is the only other character who stands out, not so much because he was particularly well developed, rather because Lawrence Fishburne managed to overcome the poor writing as an actor.  I'll cut slack to the villains since they are part of the Matrix and, given the plot, it's better to keep them in shadows and mystery.  As for the new character, Niobe, she screams token black character . . . and what about the new operator on the Nebechenazzar?  Can we get any more typical?Throughout the course of the movie, not much really happens in Matrix: Reloaded besides fights, fights, and more fights.  The film could easily have been cut 30 minutes shorter and we'd miss a few meaningless snippets of dialogue and a little action here and there, or in other words there's not a whole hell of a lot of plot going on-this is the trip from Point A (Neo's revelation about the Matrix in the first movie) to Point B (Neo's eventual resolution regarding the Matrix in the third movie) and the only way the Wachowski Brothers know how to spice it up is with fights, fights, an orgy, and more fights.To Reloaded's defense: it did have a few interesting commentaries and points that it made.  It's a shame that the Wachowski brothers chose to exploit them as Reloaded's plot instead of as a mere point, but it did have a few good ideas that I've always asked of any given epic film.  `Why -are- they listening to that person they don't even know just because he says he's a 'goodguy'?'Again, Reloaded is a fun mindless ride as long as you don't start expecting too much out of the film or ask too many questions.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The broposkis made a landmark film back in 99 with the original. It was flawless. People regarded it as a 'cult' classic. I'm sorry but the term 'cult' does not apply here. Save that for blue brothers, breakin', flashdance, footloose or whatever, basically films that have a charm deep rooted in quirkiness and have dated in the coolest possible way, that have gained a fan base overtime. The matrix was a classic film the same way that the godfather was a classic film. Of course they are different, but they were pushed to the limit of greatness within its own genre, and that's what makes them great films.Enter matrix reloaded. One question you guys, what the hell happened? Music, editing, acting, pacing, sense of wonder, sense of awe, perfection of craft in the script, so what does that leave? Oh yeah. SFX. We still have those. And kung fu. Too much bloody kung fu.The neo from the end of the original hasn't advanced. Hes no longer god like. He is the neo who was trained by morpheus to do kung fu, has polished up a bit, and can now fly. That's just sheer laziness in terms of character progression, and as a result the film suffers from what could've/ should've been. Instead we get something..quite different.The MR is the last thing anyone with half a brain cell and the slightest hint of anticipation ever expected. Its as if the simulation for the world of the matrix has become a porno movie with sexually experienced and talented actors taking place of the real actors (and you kind of expect Ron Jeremy to board the nebuschar or whatever and ask trinity if she likes anal). Except its all foreplay and you never see trinity (oh, oh oh, and I would pay 10 times the amount to see monica belucci with the things like this) nekkid. It's this kind of approach that WILL divide audiences and critics and WILL be a cult classic. Ok so its different from the original, its bound to be. But the acting is like fleshgordon (or porno), the dialogue like ulysees, or starcom or animalympics or something like that (or even porno), and the underground dancing scene in zion, if anyone here remembers, like fraggle rock (or, dare I say it, porno). I could almost hear the theme tune 'drag your cares away, worries for another day...', amongst the truly crap 90s techno and imagine one of those green little things get p***** that red ate his little glass thing he spent ages working on. Either that or the music video to duran duran's 'wild boys'. And what you get is some rumpin pumpin betwixt this, which makes it seem even more strange. I DO understand the significance of this scene, its just that its cheesier than a cheesecutters cheese slicer after its cut the cheesiest of cheeses on the cheese market. In France.And in one scene I could've sworn I heard the drum n bass 'cover version' of sesame street in one of the kung fu scenes. Either that or it was sonic the hedgehog or marioland or something. I just hope to god I'm wrong when I see it a second time (it was probably just linkin park).People compare this to the phantom menace. Actually, I'd say its more like attack of the clones, as it's not COMPLETELY flat, and it's marginally better. It's a pretty bad film that has some cool scenes. Comes to think of it, This is like batman returns going onto batman and robin. But that I could understand. Joel Schumacher is a fruity, campy man who saw this franchise as his big chance of displaying fetishist desires of leather and rubber costumes (GO TO IT MACHY, YA BIG FRUIT!). The matrix reloaded is made by the same directors. Go figure.This film had the most interesting effect on its audience that I've seen in a while. People just walking in and out of the cinema, casually complying with the rules of nature, not caring if they miss anything. That's because the first half is like a TV movie and people felt right at home (the last half, thankfully, is a lot better, and NEARLY has some of the intrigue you got in the whole of the first one). X men 2 didn't have that effect on its audeince. Lord of the rings, despite being longer film(s), didn't either. And the first Matrix sure as hell didn't. The reason is that those films had a coherent narrative and made its subject matter seem interesting. I find it so bizarre that the bloposkis, after demonstrating with such deftness with the original, did such a cut n' paste job. At the end of the day, films divide critics into love and hate categories. A personal opinion based on personal taste. But narrative structure is universal and compulsive to what makes the film easy to sit through and digest. If there is a problem of narrative, its there and no opinion can divide that, and as a result the film can and will- suffer.But, the thing is, everything I've said so far is not actually criticism. This IS a cult classic because of how it is and I love this sort of thing. I just never expected it from a matrix sequel. The bloposkis have screwed up the chance of making one of the best trilogies of all time BIG time. And that's no mean feat.  I love this film dearly and cannot wait to see it again, because I love films that are so bad there good. It works better than those two sh** star wars films because its adult oriented and there still remains a sense of intrigue of what the hell is going on. Its hilarious in places, sometimes intentional, sometimes, as with the zion/rumpin pumpin scene, un-intentional. But you do get the impression that the campiness was deliberate. The final shot of the film contains a very abstract revelation (that wont be revealed until revolutions is out) the music goes -DERR DERRR!! Fade to black. I'm not kidding. And that sums this up pretty well, ridiculous and confusing.Put the matrix reloaded into a blender and the ingredients would be- the phantom menace, batman and robin, attack of the clones, flashgordon, bound (for the rump and pump) death race 2000, blade 2, remo williams: the adventure begins, fragglerock, plus anything with Ron Jeremy, Sarah Young or annabel Chongonem (minus the gratutious exposition), add a small pinch of the original matrix, = THE MATRIX RELOADED. And the result is one of the most 'interesting' sequels of recent memory.Peter Jackson, you can rest easily, the holy trilogy moniker will be yours.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The trouble is that when you create something as totally original and visual as the first movie you're never going to be able to recreate that level of originality with the same project again. So all the Wachowski brothers could do was take what they created in the first movie and crank it up a notch or two, which is exactly what they have done.The fight sequences and car chases are as good as anything you could ever hope to see and the film races along at a pace that makes a 2 hour film feel much shorter (unlike X2 which seemed to go on forever despite being a good film). Okay so Morpheus was starting to gat a bit annoying with his crazy preacher bit for much of the movie, going on about his 'prophecies', but when all his illusions are shattered at the end of the movie when the truth about Neo's exhistense is revealed it justifies its inclusion in the movie. Besides Lawrence Fishburne makes up for it with a truly great fight sequence on top of the moving lorry so we'll forgive him. It will be extremely interesting to see how the events of the end of this movie effect the moral of our team of heroes and how Morpheus' belief and faith holds together after all his illusions have been shattered.In all honesty this is just a chapter in a three part story and won't be fully appreciated until the final installment hits us later this year. But nevertheless if you want to be entertained and see some serious Kick a**e action then you won't see a better example than this all summer.Go see and make up your own mind.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Wander out into the streets and all you see are rows of shuttered and tightly bolted shops; no-one about apart from the solitary shuffling drunk.  Even the church bells don't wake up until later.  Nothing much to do except gaze expectantly at the multiplex billboard in the search for something to look forward to, come the afternoon.  I've failed in this place before, reduced to such cretinous concoctions as ""The Waterboy"" and ""Waking Ned"".  Today doesn't look too promising either.  Something called ""The Matrix Reloaded"" heads the list. I'm always suspicious of sequels as everyone tells you they're never as good as the original, but never having seen ""The Matrix"" (Mark I) which is generally described as a great cult movie, I could be at an advantage of those ahead of me in the queue.  After all, as a great ""Psycho"" fan, I have to admit that ""Psycho 2"" was a good bit of fun.  I take the plunge and enter the noise cavern that is today's cinema.  Just over two hours later I have to say that I have had something of an experience.  I can't say exactly what except that is was a continuous onslaught on the senses that at times gave me something akin to pleasure.  I couldn't begin to tell you what it was about except that there were goodies and baddies battling it out in a future world that occasionally disconcerted with almost surreal elements of today - downtown city skyscapes and a tenement courtyard.  All I needed to do was to latch on to Keanu Reeves and girlfriend and hope they will make it through a labyrinth of dangers.  What really turned me on was all that Kung-Fu stuff, particularly two sequences; firstly where Reeves fights it out against an army of identikit men that had the brilliance of ballet at its best and then a fabulous battle on a busy city freeway the like of which for sheer ""perpetuum mobile"" I have never seen before.  The fact that nearly everyone wears dark glasses that always stay on whatever they get up to I suppose is all part of the cult thing.  I have to confess to finding it all infinitely more enjoyable than the much hyped ""Crouching Dragon, Hidden Tiger"" which seemed tame if not lame by comparison.  When I finally surfaced for air and reality Northern Ireland had come to life.  The street was full of Sunday afternoon shoppers.  It was all so normal and reassuring.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Matrix: Reloaded is an insult to anyone who enjoyed the first movie, or likes movies that have linear storylines in general.also, if i payed full price to see this piece of garbage, why was i not allowed to see the Zion ships defending themselves from the 'squiddies'?

It doesn't really matter because the Matrix Reloaded is superb, and don't believe anything anyone says otherwise.Before I saw the film I was worried it wasn't going to live up to mine or it's own expectations. In particular I thought it would just become another action film, set apart only by the computer effects. I worried  that the depth and intelligence of the first would be forsaken and the characters made irrelevant. Kudos to the Wachowskis for not betraying their initial vision because on every front, Reloaded not only maintains the spirit of the first film but builds on it. The characters are built further, particularly Neo and Trinity (Keanu Reeves is still perfect as Neo and he even gives actual acting a shot, but Carrie-Anne Moss is still pretty wooden), although you might find it hard to believe, the chemistry between the two is actually very strong, you really believe that they're in love (making the decision Neo takes at the end of the film all the more believeable).
The plot moves the film along nicely, the characters play well off of each other, all the new ones fit perfectly into the film (especially Seraph and The Keymaker) and there's some interesting tension between the humans as it's clear that many are still not convinced that Neo is The One. Agent Smith returns (many times over) and brings the same wonderfully restrained humor as before, as well as the inescapable menace and danger. What's great is that this film goes even deeper, exploring much more the whys rather than the hows of Neo's power, which is what really makes you want to see the final film. Once again, the plot is as absorbing and compelling as the fight scenes.And so, finally, to the fight scenes. Everyone already knows about the 100 Agent Smiths taking on Neo, and the $40 million Highway battle. However, there are other fights all of which match or excel the first film and the choreography is truly exceptional. The fight against the Agent Smiths is, without a doubt, the greatest ever and the Highway chase is incredible. It is impossible to really describe these scenes, to re-phrase Morpheus, 'No-one can be told how good the Matrix (Reloaded) is, you have to see it for yourself'.Go see it, go see it now.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Now that it's available for DVD I would like to revise a few things.  As I was trying to watch it, I kept blinking out.  No matter how hard I concentrated and how much I wanted to watch the movie, it just couldn't hold my interest and I now know why.  The movie is lifeless.  It has no soul.  I compare it to watching your best friend play someone else on a video game and you are observing.  Sure it's fun to them and for you it's semi-interesting, but after awhile you become bored with it because it doesn't involve you.  The Matrix Reloaded doesn't bring it audience in with it.  It doesn't seem like it is interested in presenting characters that you care about.  Neo, Trinity, Morpheus and even Agent Smith are just cardboard cutout of their previous self from the previous movie.  Morpheus and Neo have become deities (for lack of a better word) and Trinity is there in order to give Neo a purpose, but she doesn't do much.  Zion, the last free city, doesn't seem like a city worth fighting for.  It's more like an elaborate cave dwelling. But the one thing that stands out like a scab is the obvious looking fake scenes.  Everything is so obvious CGI.  At least the first film final battle seemed as if there was some serious since of urgency and danger.  But this one hits you with so many stunts and CGI effects that after awhile, it becomes dull.  I still give it props on what it is TRYING to achieve, but I have to toned down my earlier glowing remarks.  Hopefully Revolutions can wrap things us for us and make this film a better film.  I know it's a better film, but until Revolution comes out, the trees indeed are blocking the forest.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You have nothing better to do this summer than to see this movie.  I'm not saying `if you don't have anything better to do this summer then see this movie.'  I'm saying that there is absolutely nothing more important for you to do this summer than to go see this movie.  If you haven't seen it yet, then stop what you're doing right now and go see it.  This review may sound like it is all going to be glowing praise (and it is), but I think this movie deserves it.  And this is coming from somebody who usually picks movies apart.One observation, this has to be one of the most reviewed movies ever and everybody has an opinion about it.  It's been out for two days and there's close to 500 reviews on this site already.  A second observation, people either seem to have been really disappointed or to have really loved it. I'm obviously one of the later.  As far as the people who were disappointed, I'm not sure which movie they were watching but the one I saw was amazing. It's probably the best movie I've seen since.well, since the first Matrix.I have considered if I could possibly say if Reloaded is as good as or even better than the first, but that would be a very strong statement.  At this point, I have only seen it once so I will say my opinions on the movie aren't fully developed yet.  I think I will have to see it a few more times before I could possibly consider making that statement (my friends and I considered staying and catching the next show after seeing it the first time.  I will definitely see it a few times next week).  I would say that the first Matrix definitely has some qualities that are better than Reloaded.  You can watch the first movie and are left with a good feeling, the war is not over yet, but Neo's out to kick some a$$ and the machines are going definitely going to get what's coming to them.  At the end of the Reloaded the future is definitely not certain and the only feeling you're left with is `how am I going to possibly wait to find out what happens'. This is possibly the movie's only flaw, the fact that I have to wait far too long to see Revolution.  (Is it November yet???).Some people have said the movie has no plot.  What???  Seriously what movie did you see???  Just like the first Matrix I will probably have to see it few more times before I begin to grasp all the details of the plot and I'm no dummy.Again, some people have complaints about the special affects and the action sequences.  They do have a bit different flavor than the first movie but I think they work very well in Reloaded.  The scene on the highway was amazing.  I own a motorcycle and that scene makes me want to do really, really bad things on my bike.  I have made a rule for myself not to ride right after watching that movie.  And yes, the fight scenes are long. But I did not say too long.  Perhaps the reason one might think that they are too long is that one has forgotten to breathe and is nearly ready to pass out. The fight scene with Neo vs. Agent Smith and Agent Smith and Agent Smith.was so fun to watch.  There was so much on the screen going on at once that I'm sure I missed some of it the first time.  If you weren't sure after the first movie whether or not Neo was The One, you will be now.The rave/love scene in Zion was not quite what I was expecting to see in this movie but still very good.  It was very sensual.  By the end I felt like I needed a cigarette.Ok, since it will probably take you longer to read my review than to actually see the movie, I'll try and wrap it up soon.  Many people have said they are disappointed with the Matrix Reloaded, but maybe they are expecting to see and exact carbon copy of the first movie.  This it is not. Reloaded is much, much deeper and has slightly different flavor than the first, but is definitely a very worthy sequel.  The story, the acting, the special affects, the action sequences, everything was done very well.  If you liked the first Matrix (which probably goes for 99% of the western hemisphere and anybody still reading this review) then you will love Matrix Reloaded. So take the red pill and see how deep the rabbit hole goes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I thought the concept was fantastic.  The film took a theme that has been hashed unsuccessfully in previous movies and made it into something original and exciting.  It was a piece on reality that was shockingly clever.  It gave you something that few movies these days can promise: something different.So you can imagine my eagerness and anticipation for the next installment of the movie in 'The Matrix Reloaded'.Well, upon seeing it for the first time last night, all I can say is ""blah"". My disappointment and dissatisfaction know no bounds.  Whatever promise this series had has been terminated completely in a mix of over-pretentious dialogue, clunky acting, and a story that leaves you with zero enthusiasm for 'Matrix Revolutions'.The killing point is the story itself.  Rather than sticking to the more promising element of the actual 'Matrix' itself, the movie focuses more around the human habitation of Zion... which ultimately turns the film into a 'Star Trek' science epic as opposed to a play on reality. This wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, if what you wanted in the first place was a 'Star Trek' science epic.Unfortunately, however, what made 'The Matrix' so engaging to the viewer was the focus on the Matrix itself, as well as the characters' interactions inside and out of it.  Moreover, the themes discussed in the movie were much less complicated for the viewer to grasp than in 'Matrix Reloaded'.  Almost 80% of the dialogue in 'Reloaded' is complete gibberish.Added on to this is the complete lack of chemistry between the forever talentless Keanu Reeves and the distinctly older Ms. Moss (Who, for some inexplicable reason, looks ugly in this movie).  I'm sorry, but it's impossible to sell people on the significance of a romance between two characters when said romance looks as artificial as Cher does.(All I can say is thank goodness Keanu's role was reduced to him 'acting' as little as possible.)In all fairness, the special effects in this movie are pretty impressive... but at times the fighting sequences make the characters look more like they came out of 'Shrek' than an actual Matrix movie.  Regardless, the special effects alone cannot possibly save this movie from it's painful mediocrity. ...Which, in the end, is a shame, considering how much potential this series really had.Gets the clowns_n_cookies thumbs down.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I saw this movie last night, and it was by far the worst movie I'd seen in years. There were several scenes which should have been cut, as they're blatently pointless and add nothing to plot. The action scenes could have been cut by 10 minutes each. I actually, no joke, ended up looking at my watch to see how long some of the scenes lasted, and was bored for nearly the entire thing. The computer animations were mediocre and over-used. The plot, if any, was lost amid a pointless and downright uninteresting series of action scene after action scene. As I went in the theater with somewhat of high expectations for the movie, I was very much regretting having spent money and 2 1/2 hours watching this drivel. I only hope the third movie vindicates this HORRIBLE excuse for a sequel. This was not a movie, but a segue into the third movie, and could have been equally well implemented with two well-written scenes. You want to see a sequel worth a movie ticket, go see X2: X-Men United, a cinematic work of art. If you want to cause your brain unnecessary pain and anguish, then prepare yourself to be bored for over 2 hours, and go sit through the most disappointing movie in years, and see The Matrix Reloaded.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What a supreme contradiction was this movie.  I have seen the first matrix at least 6 times and I was absolutely thrilled each time by the determination of Morphius, the sagaciousness of the Oracle, and especially by the strength and very human complexity of Neo himself.  Even though my hopes were never as high with Matrix II, still I expected somewhat more of the same.Alas all I got was a confusing and disconnected demonstration of graphic art, a complete deemphasis of character development and a hokey and miserable non-ending.  Whereas Star Wars set the tone for modern sci-fi genre, matrix II seems to have broken every rule of success and customer satisfaction.  Not only did the `to be continued' ending hearken back to the days of Wild West serials (al la Roy Rodgers), it represented a supreme departure from accepted norms, and was a huge disappointment to the viewing audience.  This was an out-and-out betrayal of the very thing that we fans have come to love and respect in our sci-fi movies.Even though I was somewhat overwhelmed by the 500 Agent Smiths jumping around and streaming ratlike through doorways and up side streets, the thrilling Freeway chase and the ubiquitous evil Twins, still none of this could make up for a truly disastrous non-conclusion.  It seemed to reduce the entire matrix story to nothing more than a cheap Saturday afternoon matinee.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was like watching a bad episode of Walker Texas Ranger with set up kicks and punches.The action scenes were full of horrible animations. Furthemore, for a 2.5 hour movie there was not any development of the story line. After, seeing this movie I felt like doing a Matrix on Keanu and Fish myself. It is a shame for the movie studio to promote this movie in the manner it did and the result was a piece of trash. Take my word for it, watch another movie.

"","","I loved the first Matrix film, but this one was awful.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704709/?ref_=tt_urv","hhayhurst","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2449296/?ref_=tt_urv","30 May 2003","It would've been impossible to replicate the incredible impact of the first film as that one was something no-one had seen before, but it should have been possible to do better than this IMHO. Yes, the action sequences were great (particularly the motorcycle scene), and the kung-fu had spectacular choreography, but that is just not enough to sustain a 2+ hour film - especially when nothing much happens for the first hour or more! The special effects were adequate though nothing that we haven't seen before, and to be honest were very comic book/computer-gamey. For example, several times during the slo-mo kung-fu it was quite obvious that Neo is a digital duplicate rather than a real person. As for the plot, it did throw up a few interesting concepts but took far too long to do so - people were simply standing around talking or holding council meetings etc for the vast majority of the film. It also contains the singlemost pointless sex scene on celluloid, adding nothing to character or plot development it's seemingly put in for the sole purpose of showing a bit of flesh. Oh yes, and let's not forget the totally juvenile crotch zoom shot (though I guess some will enjoy it for just that reason). All the new characters might have been intriguing, but instead served only to confuse the issue as many won't get to fully realize their roles until the third installment. That's a shame though, because I probably won't be bothering with that film as this one bored me rigid. And though I did 'get it', it was just very badly done - it might have been salvageable if this film had had a half-way decent dialogue writer or an editor who wasn't afraid to make some harsh cuts (about an hours worth!). As it is though, it's really only enjoyable if you are someone who enjoys action rather than acting, and style rather than substance.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

""The Matrix Reloaded"" turned out to be a major disappointment. It's not like I set my expectations too high, because I did not know what to expect from this Matrix sequel. When I first heard that the sequel was going to be released this year, I thought, how more stunning than the original Matrix movie could the sequel possibly be? Well, the astounding action sequences and the innovative special effects that wowed audiences in ""The Matrix"" are still there in ""The Matrix Reloaded."" The special effects and the action sequences in the sequel are truly astonishing. But what happened to the intriguing plot that made ""The Matrix"" so remarkable? It appears that the Wachowski brothers were more concerned with visually impressing the audience. I guess they forgot that in order to entertain the audience, the movie needs to have fascinating story as well. I struggled to stay awake during most parts of the movie, and I actually felt relieved when the movie ended. The Wachowski brothers had the opportunity to make a sequel that would top ""The Matrix,"" but this movie pales in comparison to the original. I'm convinced of one thing, which is that ""The Matrix Reloaded"" is not worth all of its hype. The movie was certainly not worth the time and money I spent to watch it. Those are two hours, eighteen minutes, and seven dollars that I will never be able to get back. Based on what I saw in this movie, I will NOT be watching the next Matrix movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Clever, not terribly profound, but a simple concept that was well developed as a convincing universe.In Reloaded, we have the same (if not better) wham-bang effects and actions, but the philoso-babble has gone completely out of control.  Between the French guy and the ""Architect"" and to a lesser extent, the Counselor (scene in the engineering room) the Wa-Brothers have seemed to have lost their sense of focus.  Granted, it's like passing this judgment after only seeing half the film, which for all intensive purposes this is, so I'll reserve final judgment until Revolutions.One final point, though.  With all the techno- and philoso- speak in this movie, and the obvious use of mythological and biblical names, wouldn't it have effective for one those excruciating monologue speakers to pause for a moment, only for Neo to remark, ""Well, Babble-on, dude!""","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Looking now Sci-Fi films nearly 25 years, I still cannot get enough, never!!!!. But some films are clear missed chances, and this one is. Ok, for comic-lovers and pure action-fans M-R1 it is nice, but not better than the first, in many ways the Kung-Fu in part one is mostly credible to me, in this film it hardly was. A good film, -my personal opinion of course-  independent if Sci-Fi-genre or not, has:  several layers of storylines, credible villains and bad guys with motives (remember the difference who got fame in all the James Bond films, and who you have forgotten an hour after you left cinema) , not too many  pseudo-instant, artificial looking lovestories,and  not too much to be forseen 'what is coming next?' parts, etc. But M-R1 has this all, (WHY????) and that made it too me in fact very boring. I still like most the mainchararters, and it would have been a pleasure to get more 'higher, psychodylic' clues what our life is about, could be about. Agent Smith, is he still 'thinking' he hates our smell? Are we like a virus? PLease let him have his quotes again!But I did not find much to remember in it Like in Kubricks Space Odyssy or Scotts first Alien, Neo meets as predictad his own 'HAL' and 'MOther' in one person, a well dressed santaclaus with of course grey beard. Why not an intriging supersmart looing child, in stead of an anchor from the old, disappeared world?The fighting with the 'new'collegues of Agent Smith is this time much more credible, than the Donald-Duck images of Smith himself. So I think in several directions the Wachowski Brothers owe the public and me, a M-R2 (MAtrix Revolutions), that let me forget the absolute boring parts this time. Being more anarchistic than conventional filmmakers, I just hope the Wachowski's will find again a clear statement against the establisment in M-R2 If you look well, we live in a total disordered and too violent world. If they choose for the easy way, easy to consume and digest, I think the elder audience like me, will pass and only part 1 will become a classicer ! But if they see, they can make a good point, I hope it will be as good as the first. (.......... there is no point, haha) All in all  I'm still and will forever be a very big fan of the old crew, and the W-brothers what they did for the genre!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Its a $5.00 movie, though I spent $12.61 to see it.What happened to Tank?Save your money and rent Dune and Thirteenth Floor or eXistenZ and you'll get the whole movie but with a craft called acting and plots that last more than 15 minutes. You'll even get CGI which approach realistic looks. (The English production of Dune definitely has much more realistic CGI though they need to teach P.H. Moriarty how to fight.) Dark City is a much better Matrix movie, and hell, even Johnny Mnemonic has better acting and a more believable story line.Why in hell was Neo worried about Trinity dieing? Its not like he isn't the Messiah anyway. Ooohh bringing back the dead, like that isn't a 2000 year old plot point. Hello! How about something NEW!!!And I think that anyone who has spent any time reading Frank Herbert, Verner Vinge, Orson Scott Card or Terry Brooks would find the whole ""Cause and Effect"" argument a little stale. So the system manipulates people, Whoopdy Doo! How about a real plot twist and actually make Pre-Determination the final truth. Make Free Will the Myth.How about this plot point no one has mentioned. The Architect MUST protect Neo both inside and outside the Matrix, which means that either the Architect has agents outside the Matrix already or Zion is just another level of programming and they really aren't free yet. I suppose though, that the Architect could also have a number of Neos racing against each other to reset the Matrix. Which would make Thomas. A. Anderson a moot point from now on.On tip, next time you create a CGI character based on real people, how about mapping a detailed GIF of their actual skin texture onto your CGI dummy so you don't plasticize their faces and don't use Blurring in order to hide transitions in the characters without blurring the backgrounds to the same extent. The introduction of the Smiths was some of the crappiest CGI I've seen since. the rescue sequence in U571, or almost all of the ship sequences in Speed 2, or perhaps the many different scaled versions of the Hulk in the ads for that upcoming disappointment. Real people have pores, wrinkles and blemishes, something that they managed to get right in MIB, but couldn't do that with Matrix even with the extra 6 months of Post Production.And Hey! Let's throw in a shot where Neo moves so fast that he picks up crap in his wake just like they had Firefox do; hey how about his ability to warp the programming around him when he goes Superman (though he didn't have to do his PowerCrouch T in the first movie); maybe he should be able to see down a hundred feet of corridor with MassiveZoom Vision T; and maybe he should be able to stop hundred of bullets in their supersonic trajectories without them having to obey the laws of physics and expend all that energy in some other form like heat, light or sound but we can't have him stop a door from closing remotely. That should be impossible.Right.I suspended my disbelief and now I can't reach it anymore.The Rave scene? That looked cool but the music sucked (maybe they should have run the credits faster and used one of the songs they had commissioned for the movie).The Sex scene? That was a sex scene? I guess Neo does a lot of Keggles.The Architects Speech? See my comments on Frank Herbert et al.The Oracles speech? Ditto.The Backdoors? Neo is a Hacker/Cracker right? Why wasn't he looking for them anyway? Why hadn't he already come up with a set of Lock-Picks?The Cause-Effect vs Predetermination argument? Manipulation, simple and direct just like those Authors I mentioned used it after all it isn't like the Architect didn't know who Thomas A. Anderson was (remember the size of the File on him?), the Architect just didn't tell Agent Smith everything, and interfered where it was necessary.And WHERE IS TANK?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

At least it's only a year between the Lord of the Rings' releases.  It's been 4 years since `The Matrix' was released, and while I have a good memory, it isn't that good.  While set 6 months into the future, `Reloaded' takes a step back and attempts to introduce some of the finer details of how the Matrix works.  It's been so long since I saw the first movie, I'm not sure that this movie is completely consistent with the first.Also, the action sequences go way too long.  I can only tolerate so many repetitive karate chops, unrealistic flips, and special effects before my attention wanders elsewhere.  They contribute very little to the plot. For example, the expressway scene could use a little cutting.  The scene with all the Agent Smiths coming out of the walls was a waste of film.  We see Neo doing his `Superman thing' at the start, and it was predictable that a similar move would be his only way out of this predicament.Finally, we learn there are some good computer-generated characters in the Matrix such as the Oracle and the Keymaker.  The scene with the Oracle is very enlightening.  But two-thirds into the film, it got me wondering.  If Neo and the gang can read the Matrix code and insert themselves into it, why can't they program an anti-Agent Smith, or some other viral characters that leads to the Matrix shutting itself down?  Furthermore, like the first movie, the relationship between Neo and Trinity seems very wooden, sterile, and unexplored.  I have a hard time understanding why Neo made the decision he did at the end.`The Matrix' series introduced a world of alternate realities and warned us that not everything is as it seems.  The special effects are amazing, and the plot is unparalleled.  It is a great storyline and could probably be transformed into a successful TV show if the writers chose to do so. Despite my criticisms, this movie is still one of the better ones I've seen, but I have even higher hopes for `Revolutions'.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

First of all you have to realize it is the middle of a trilogy which serves its purpose beautifully. Like any story the middle always has the most exposition and explanation. Second the film is loaded with philosophy and hidden meaning. Every line and scene has a purpose, you could watch this movie 10 times and not understand everything. The issues it touches on are truly epic and extremely deep. The ending is not boring, I ask one of you to explain the connection between Smith and Neo and what it means. If you can't then you dont have the right to call it bad. In other words if you dont want to think about the meaning of life or are unable to comprehend the complex metaphors and themes in this movie then do your self a favor and go see X-2.(This movie is also amazing and has some nice commentary on racism and the like.

I was not sitting on the edge of my chair waiting for the Neo vs. 100Smiths scene or the freeway scene.  I was anxious for the next step in the STORY!  Apparently the entire budget for this film was spent on effects and the paultry remaining funds went to plot development and dialog.Even the effects were amateurish.  The fight scenes made WAY too much use of the freeze frame and rotate 360 degrees shot.  I counted 6 of these in the first 30 minutes and then gave up.  And Zion...the last human city...the place of our rebirth....give me a break.  It made me think of a cheap cross between Alien and Waterworld.  It was just plain tacky.The directing on this film was some of the worst I have ever seen. Lawrence Fishburn is a GREAT actor.  So I can only imagine how much effort it must have taken to turn him into the over-enunciated baboon we see in this film. His dialog deliverance reminds me of William Shatner at his absolute worst. The speech Morpheus gives to Zion is, well, just plain cheesey.  I had flashbacks to the ""Can you dig it"" speech given by Cyrus in the 1979 film, The Warriors.  His speech is followed by a primitive rave scene that looked like it should have been left on the cutting room floor of Blade II, where they obviously found it.All in all, this was quite possibly the biggest letdown in a very long time.

One of them was watching the 9-out-of-10-on-a-sexy-scale Kary-Ann Moss hack into a computer using REAL (that's right, REAL) unix commands and scripts. I could see why this is every hacker's wet dream; they probably think: ""oh, imagine her sitting next to me on this never-before-felt-a-woman's-behind chair, and we're hacking away on my computer, and we make wild love every time we get a successful hack"", or something along these lines. Come to think of it, there were some unix freaks amongst us who got a little jumpy during this scene...What the film was lacking in plot, it more than made up for in action. The martial arts sequences could easily make a Jet-Li fight sequence seem like an instructional video for folk-dancing. The Jackie-Chan groupies amongst us (and you know who they are) were certainly impressed, but I must admit I was also nodding my head in approval. At some point the sequences even reached 300 ppm (punches-per-minute)! Some other scenes to remember were a 2000 person dance party (probably filmed in Ibiza without the people noticing), a five minute exchange of intellectual phrases that made me wish I had brought along my notepad, and again the beautifully constructed body of Kary-Ann in full leather riding on a motorcycle (with a little promotion for Ducati bikes).In conclusion: I'd rate this film 7 out of 10. This film sure beats the crap out of HBO reruns, so if you've got no other plans, go see it! However, if your movie budget is a little tight and you're waiting for something special to shell out a few bucks on, I'd hold out a little longer 'till X-Men 2 or Terminator 3 reach your neighborhood cinema. In hindsight, being a computer user I should've known this is how things would turn out, based on the film's name; after all, when you ""reload"" a computer application doesn't that mean something bad just happened?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The whole thing was a huge Star Wars rip off. It was like watching the Phantom Menace all over again. The council, the ships, Neo using the Force, EVERYTHING!! And could someone tell me why Roy Jones Jr. was in it? I was waiting for Don King to come out and yell, ""Only in the Matrix!"" And wasn't Jada Pinkett supposed to be a main character? comon, Roy Jones had more lines than her. The game makes up for the s****iness of the movie though.

"","","My 2 cents.. The movie was damn good!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704038/?ref_=tt_urv","archangel_ny77","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2426074/?ref_=tt_urv","20 May 2003","I normally don't read nor respone to critics and their views, but after reading the reviews, and speaking to some people about this movie, i have to fire back and ask this one question, WHAT IN THE BLUE HELL WERE YOU WATCHING. I mean i am shocked by the response that this movie is getting, but then i'm not, cause star wars got the same response when it came out. To those who did like it, i have to say you got the movie and the plot, to those who didn't you were sleep b4 the movie began. I know what happen, you ""FANBOYS"" got your hearts broken cause the movie didn't go as how u wrote it in your minds. You didn't go in with an open mind and say ok, Thrill me. You were looking for the first one all over again, who wants to sit thru the same old thing in a new movie, i wanted to see new things, bigger fx and an exciting story and more action. Reloaded and Revolution is one big story cut in half, so of course Reloaded isn't going to end cleanly because the 3rd one is going to be the climax, and if you were waiting for that in this one, boy you set your ownself up for the fall. I can't belive half of u blast the two best scenes in the movie, the burly brawl and the car chase, i don't know what theater you were in where people were walking out, but in mines we were clapping and screaming in awe, you must have saw it with old fuddy duddies. I liked the story, i liked the twist that it created, and how it left us in suspense for Revolutions, yeah it leaves you feeling unfinshed cause it finishes in the next one DUH. Maybe the reason some of you were falling alseep cause they were using too big of words for your closed minds to comprehend, it just flew past you, your built too low. And most of you r attacking the zion dance scene, to me it added some emotion to it, which was lacking in the first, the first one was one way flat on feelings. I'm glad they had the love triangle in there, and the Neo and Trinity relationship advance more in this, just like Empire strikes back did, romance does help the story and plays a big part in them. And you also say that Reloaded didn't act like how a Matrix movie should, there was only one movie b4 this one, there wasn't like 3 more b4 this, so it didn't have to follow the same guidelines, if u didn't get the first movie then you are lost in this one, matter of fact this one answers questions from 1. To me you ""FANBOYS"" know how to ruin a picture when it does go your way, just because you hated it, don't influnce everyone else not to see it, let them decide, if they like it they like it if they don't then they don't. it boils my blood when i see people discourage others from seeing it, u got to see it on big screen, let them. Anyway, nothing sucked about this movie, it was an improvement on 1, and i have a new respect for it too. To those who r reading these reviews, don't let them decide for you, follow your own mind and see it. To me it was one of the best movies i have seen in a long time, and i can't wait for 3. I have seen it twice already and going back for a third, to those who didn't like it, sorry you didn't, only thing i can say is you didn't get it at all.But i feel that when Revolution comes out, u will owe Reloaded an apology, and realize that it was a setup for this one. I think only true movie fans will enjoy it. But i think the two movies that will suck this summer r THE HULK, and T3, The hulk looks too fake, as for T3,WHY?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The trailer shows Neo alive and kicking, so why not?Let me just add a few reasons why I think this film stunk:1. Agents who all had to look like the young Robert Ryan, and it looked like they had been forced to graduate from The Robert Ryan School of Sneering, if there is something called that. Seriously, the agents in the first film defined what agents should look and behave like.2. Neo flying around all the time. In the first film, Neo was flying ONCE, right at the end, which unfortunately set up this film. Now he is doing all the time, and it is stupid and boring. It would have been more fun to see Keanus stone-face against the bluescreen they obviously filmed him against instead of the projected background.3. The fight-scenes, especially the ones with the Oracles guardian and the thousand Agent Smiths, looked like computer-game-fights. The fun of computer-games is that you can actively take part and play, but here, you just had to watch it.But still, this one has grossed almost twice as much worldwide as the first, and to quote Treebeard: - That makes no sense to me. It´s too bad that the George Lucas-method still works.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Yes there was some feel of the Ten Commandments at the speech by Zion.  But in this film the people of Zion are not worth saving after their disgusting mush scene.  The human race is not very likable as portrayed in the film which makes it very hard to want to see Zion saved.They jump around and have a goofy love scene as preparation for the final conflict and we hardly feel like this is a noble cause. Cause to save what? Reeves is always trying to get a quick kiss thus he does not really seem like the chosen one after we see his washed out computer cafe type groupie. The weird French chic and French guy seem out of some artsy underground film.The action though is cool.  It is not the type of intensity of the individual battles of the first one. It does have a number of good action moments.  Jackie Chan should have been in this in Matrix meets Chan. It is worth seeing but needed to cut some of the talk and all of the mushy parts.  The philosophy and action is fine.  Is choice an illusion?  I say choice is not an illusion.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I felt myself drifting off into weariness (and yes, I had enough sleep) when I heard the long-winded and elaborate dialogue about things that tax the brain to the limit, although some of the themes touched on are undoubtedly interesting. It makes me wonder what happened to the time when movies were popularly black-and-white, and I think, much more enjoyable for their simplicity.It must be said, however, that the special effects are flawless and the setpieces are very brilliant, and the film deserves every acclaim for this achievement.Therefore, I give this film half marks, for it's aesthetic brilliance, but it looses marks because of it's reliance on it's prequel and it's dissapointing ending.  5/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was all a confusing mess. There was some of the worst editing I have ever seen in all the scenes that took place in Zion. I did, however think that the set design for Zion was very cool, with the exception of the dancing cave(shudders). The BS philosophical discussions get SO obnoxious after a while, they sound like the the things people from my high school talk about. The fight scene with the 100 Smiths was cool, but I could easily tell the difference between when they were using live shots of Keanu and when they were using a CG Keanu. That was distracting. The car chase scene was INCREDIBLE, especially when the two semis hit head-on and you could see the viscousness of the flames erupting from the explosion. The freeway scene was frought with violent, almost pornographic car crashes, which were all awesome. I also thought that the spiraling trail of cars behind Neo when he was flying in the city was neat. Then back to the incoherent editing. It was never clearly explained what was on that particular floor(63rd?) of the skyscraper, or what exactly the keymaker is doing.

As if predestined, I was left with the question of ""why"", because I had already made a choice to watch this movie.After watching this movie, I was left with more choice. Do I choose to watch it again because I had no idea what the hell NEO and the Architect was talking about? Again, I had already made the choice, but I was left with the question of ""why"" do I want to watch this increasingly befuddling piece of philosophical movie with dialect straight out of 18th century philosophical text.During the second viewing, I was left with an another choice. Do I walk out of the movie theater door or do I fall asleep? Will Zion NOT be destroyed if I fell asleep? This time, I went against my predestined choices, and watched the movie to the end against my destiny.  Fate, as I would have it, is not always predetermined. Unfortunately, I had to again watch the horrible scene between NEO and the architect. And again, I had no idea what the hell they were talking about. But this did not stop myself from asking ""why""? Why did I spend total of $19.50 to watch it twice? Will watching it third time answer the question ""why""? So, as if predetermined, I watched it again. This time in iMax nonetheless. Then it struck me, I then understood ""Why"". I watched the movie for 3rd time because that's how many times it took me to understand what the hell NEO and the Architect was talking about. Then I had an epiphany, the movie had predestined viewers like me to watch it at least twice because they purposely made all dialect and plots impossibly difficult to understand with one viewing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There's a raunchy rave/sex scene at the beginning, so you might not want to check out the movie with grandma; but your little brother might find it stimulating.There's a whole aceload of bad dialogue, and that Morpheus ""speech"" was just f'ing odd, to say the least. But never mind that, and yes I've begun the sentence with a conjuction. So sue me, you fairy queens.The Burly Brawl -AKA- ""big fight with all the mean men in suits"" ran a little too long in my very humble opinion. It was enjoyable, nevertheless.Merovingian -AKA- ""that French dude that said 'It's like wiping your _ahhs_with silk!"" is pure comedy. Clearly he will play a large role in the next movie. People are still speculating about who the hell he is. People are speculating the hell out of this movie, period, and that's how it should be.Persephone was hot; um, that's about it. She just didn't do that much. What is more intriguing about her is her possible connection with the Architech. We'll be seeing more of her jugs--her, more of her.Hmm, more problems... Let's see...Wait, mofo, I'm thinking.
Oh, very funny.Some f***wits like to rag on the causality/philosophical discussions, often coining such words as ""convoluted,"" ""psudo,"" ""trite"" (which I at least can accept) and oh, how I love that little homosexual word ""muddled."" Do not listen to them. I speak objectively, good human. The scene with Neo and the Architech is probably the best in the movie. The Causality one
Speaking of bests, here's one of the worst. It's gotta go to that precious council meeting in Zion. You know, the one with that Lock guy and those officials batting hot, smelly platitudes back and forth like poopy tennis balls? Bad simile, I know. And how about the oblicatory crowd of peasants, or whatever the hell they were. I do not know the guy that played Lock, and I do not know anything of his prior credentials, but I think it's safe enough to say he sucks mightily. I'm a huge fan of the movies, but that whole scene just lame.Blah, blah. Twins were cool, didn't get enough screen time.Seraph - (See above to a lesser extent) Fight with Merovingians goons was kinda overkill and went on too long.
Excellent movie, and should not be compared with Lord of the Rings or Star Wars by any means. Star Wars and LotR are not science fiction; they are fantasy. Robots and aliens do not a science fiction movie make. Yes, they are all successful trilogies. Undoubtedly, they are even similarities between the movies, oh my! Still, there need not be rivalries or cliques, you moronic fanboys. You people are tainting forums all over the net with your incessant ""which is better than which?"" topics. Please stop.

The first was more coherent and the atmosphere was darker and more evocative. Still,it's a great movie and I expect a shocking conclusion.

It is a very good sequel to the first part.Granted, a lot of the coolness of the first movie is no longer as surprising or cool, but still the movie is very solid in every aspect.The movie follows a solid story, and if anyone actually focused on the dialogs between Neo and the Oracle and the ""Architect"" they would find the story is solid and heading in a very pleasant direction. The plot is strong and the scripting is wonderful. It goes without saying that the action scenes are superb, though after a while you begin to get that feeling of watching the Terminator movies.. All the scenes until the last one are not going to surprize you because you already know that neither the bad guy nor the good guy are going to die.The movie does have two drawbacks.. The first is Keanu Reeves.. The man just should not act. But he is a penalty that all three movies will endure. The one thing that this series has going for it is that the main character has to look cool and carry a stern face around most of the time, something Reeves does with excellence. His love scene with Carrie-Ann Moss is nothing short of dreadful, she might as well have been having sex with her laptop. There is no chemistry between Reeves and Moss, and it is not Moss' fault, there is no chemsitry between Reeves and anything in that movie, except his sunglasses. The other drawback is the cheese.. The people who are ""outside the matrix"" who are living in the real world, wear weird robes and dance to African drums in the ""temple"" and have wild collective parties and are basically copied from a mixture of sci-fi/fantasy sources. There is no denying that those people are refugees who should be having it tough, but the image that the writers and directors created.. It just makes you want to take the blue pill and go live back in the computer generated fantasy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The pacing was erratic in this flick. The fight scenes got almost monotonous. I still was held in wonder at the highway scene.And I actually thought the Architect stuff was good mostly due to a nice performance from the actor playing him. This movie needed to be trimmed though, cut out most of Zion,come up with a better storyline than ""the keymaster"" and cut down on some of the extraneous stuff, and it would have been a contender.

There are two n' a half times as many characters, some who come and go so fleetingly (the ""Kid"", the woman at the dinner table who farts), and others who stay on screen much longer than necessary (Persephone's husband, the Twins).""Mark my words, and mark them well. I have survived your predecessors, and I will survive you!"" That's a typical piece of dialogue, this particular line being uttered by Persephone's husband, who's some mayor-type. The movie is filled to the brim with ""Braveheart""-style yappin', yet it takes place in the future! Only Link, the phone-line operator of the Nebbecha-something, offers anything that can be remotely considered realistic dialogue, as he chats with his woman about her concern about his lengthy missions. But even he blows it with his ""Yes, Sir! Understand, Sir!"" (repeated like 50 times) to Morpheus. Even the council scene, where the leaders of Zion blab about the best course of action, doesn't help matters any. It's like the ""council"" scene out of The Phantom Menace!The first Matrix was a gem. Everybody didn't wear sunglasses IN EVERY SCENE! The original had only infrequent fight scenes, not like this poop. Now, the Oracle's assistant, the Asian guy, fights Neo upon their introduction because ""You don't really know someone until you fight them."" HUH? The Matrix poo, I mean Matrix 2, is one big fight scene with butt-headed scenes inbetween to kill the time. Then you got the freeway fight scene. Look, there's only so many ways I can see a car flip over 16 times in slow-motion. And hey, wouldn't Neo's Mach 2 rescue of Morpheus and the Keymaster from the top of the truck break all of their bones? Right? NO REALISM! THE FIRST ONE HAD sorry - some sense of realism.Even worse, there's the showdown in the NYC-type courtyard between Agent Smith and Neo. First they chat like two ol' guys who had a fender bender the day before. But aren't they rivals, you know, like the fight-to-the-death kind? And yet they have a nice long chit-chat. And what about the dialogue, then extended, winded, overbaked dialogue between the Keymaster, Morpheus, Neo, Niobi, and like four others, and they're all talkin' about breaking into the building. ""314 seconds!"" ""Two minutes!"" ""Guard shift change!"" Talk about confusing! Too many scene cuts, back pedaling, and other switcheroos. I was traumatized, and I can't talk about it anymore.Here's some more sample screenwriting: Smith: ""I want what you want... everything."" Morpheus: ""Would that include a bullet from this gun?"" This is B-movie quality!There are too many numbers to keep track of. 6 previous Matrixes, 314 seconds, 2 doors, 100 Agent Smiths, 24 hours before the machines attack, 3 hovercrafts... the number of bullets in Trinity's guns as she shoots while plummeting to her almost certain doom.Then you got the Architect, who plain out sucks.And worst of all, if Neo can stop bullets in midair just by raising his hand, take on Agent Smiths x 100, go supersonic, and do every other damn thing, then why can't he just save Zion and thus save the day?I might be slow (it took me about half a dozen viewings to understand the first Matrix), but Matrix II is just beyond me. Inferior to the orginal. But it's good enough for me - to poop on!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Matrix, Real World, Zion, nothing. Things did start out the way its shown on ""Second Renaissance"" but that was thousands of years ago. The real world (zion) and the virtual world (matrix) are multi dimensional systems (That explains how they can go from one dimension to another.) All of the things that happen in the matrix (and real world, which is also a matrix) are experiments. Experiments to find out different reactions and results from humans.Agent Smith, Guns, Swords, Oracle, Neo etc. were created by the machines to learn more about humans. The Architect says it all in the movie: he tells Neo about the different matrix that they created, and results they got from them. Neo and all of the current programs were created to find out human emotions (Making Neo fall in love with Trinity).We also know that Neo is different from all the other experimented objects. In the third movie, Neo is going to come back from his coma knowing all (Enlightenment)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","A highly flawed motion picture--the devil is in the details.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0705043/?ref_=tt_urv","shawnullerup","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2481192/?ref_=tt_urv","26 June 2003","The original Matrix owed its freshness and originality, in large measure, to a basic retelling of themes of recalcitrant heroism, spiritual struggle, and ancient-academy butt-whomping, retold within a new-school rubric of cyber-fiction, anime, and groundbreaking visual effects.  It was a simple picture, despite its stylistic trappings, with a very simple theme (which resounds in the western cinema from ""Shane"" to ""Star Wars"" to ""L.O.T.R."") about the Orphean/Christian journey of the hero, who voluntarily journeys into hell to give a boon to the world.  ""The Matrix"" was a remarkably straightforward tale, complete in itself; even though the Wachowski Bros. left plenty of room at the end for a sequel, and left the audience tantalized and wanting to know more, we really didn't need to, because we knew Neo had won the battle for us.But we still want to know more, right?  We want details about not only the future of the story--how close do the machines get to conquering humanity, and our heroes on the ""Nebuchadnezzar""-- but about the present--life in Zion, and so forth.  There's the rub:  The Matrix's creators need to trump their original creation in the details is what makes ""Matrix Reloaded"" an inferior film compared to the sequel.  Did we really need a 10 minute MTV Spring Break in the cave to celebrate Morpheus' upcoming  Armageddon with the machines, in order to paint a picture of life in Zion?  Even the machines have their own dramas amongst each other that we biologicals just don't need to know a great deal about.  This is us vs. them, right?The details though, aren't entirely without merit.  Morpheus' switch from simple prophet to zealot was enlightening,  and we did need to understand more about the Oracle's role (sadly punctuated by a interminably laughable fight scene with 1001 otherwise flawless Hugo Weavings) with the Matrix Creator (God?? Satan?? your PHI 325 prof??), if this film were to have any meaning at all.  It's not so much what details were thrown at us that makes this film inferior, as how all of the details were thrown at us at once, without regard for editing.  You could have completely edited out Jada-Pinkett Smith, for instance, and still given her a supporting credit without really noticing her character was gone.  As usual.As the film progressed, I found myself sorely wanting the smooth consistency and integration of all of the elements that made the original such an instant classic.  What I found was a studio franchise.    This was not even a decent transitional sequel, as was SW Empire Strikes Back.  The fight scenes, instead of being awe-inspiring, were largely superfluous; the philosophic elements were overwhelming rather than digestable.  Where was the editor??Just like, say, A. C. Clarke's novel follow-up to Kubrick's ""2001"" should never be read, this movie should never be seen by those devotees  of the original ""Matrix"" for precicely the same reason:  this sequel gives away too much, and has no regard for the audience's ability to participate creatively.  It's hard to believe this was created by the same people responsible for the original.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Not because the special effects (they were awesome, but that didn't make the movie great), but because I saw the birth of a new mythology of Star Wars proportions or even more. All the elements of a perfect mythology were there: the chosen one, the prophecy, the mentor, the discipline, the all controlling force, the inner power capable of changing the outer world, the tyrants controlling the world. Everything a good, world-changing mythology has had for as long as man has been man. Better yet, all that brought to a familiar setting, a relevant and modern reality that could be our own. The first Matrix made me believe. Compare that to the second. The reality of Reloaded is another world far away from our own. The streets look too yellow, the park looks like it has a ceiling (like a sound stage, more accuratly), and all the new characters don't look like someone you could bump into in the street. Even the buildings look alien. I stopped believing. By the time that 2 hours of kung-fu fighting and raves had passed, I stopped caring. It seems I am not alone. People I know that have seen Reloaded feel that emptiness too. That feeling of  ""I don't care if Neo survives or saves the world, I don't care about the Matrix anymore"". So, I am worried that this has been a fatal blow to what could have been the mythology of our decade. I hope I am wrong, but I don't think that revolutions will create much anticipation. I don't think it will bring lots of money. And what's worse, I don't think that it will make people care about the Matrix any more.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I understood Plato's philosophical jargon, I understood genetics, and I even understood the whole concept of Stargate SG1. But This film made NO sense whatsoever.Frankly, it seemed like an excuse to watch Keanu Reeves (a very sexy man, for the record) Jump around doing strange martial-arts kind of movements in an unflattering raincoat.

I should have brought a dictionary and a guide to Modern Philosophy to try and understand what these guys were talking about.  Was it me or did all the characters look terrible?  Especially Laurence Fishburne!  Looked like he helped himself to the all you can eat movie set lunches one too many times.  There were way too many characters, therefore, no character development, lots of talk, but not substance, lots of action, but way to drawn out (been there, done that, just saw that).  I swear I thought I was watching ""Star Wars meets Mad Max and Superman meets When Harry met Sally meets The Power of Easter!"" all rolled into one movie.  I give it a 4 out of 10.

Keep in mind, I have Ph.D, and think really deep thoughts, but the only thought that kept popping into my head during Reloaded is, ""Why don't they turn up the darn lights?""  I mean, is this film dark or what?  And all the actors look so dirty and greasy, I felt like taking a shower after  watching it.  And the so-called state of the art special effects came off looking (at least to me) so phony they actually made me laugh, especially during that l-o-n-g fight scene (you know the one).  I swear, I almost fell asleep during parts of this movie.  And the dialogue is so bad, I wonder how some of those actors could say the lines with a straight face.  Now I know, somebody will rag me out and say how out of touch I am; but surely this cannot be an example of cutting-edge movie making.

Its plot offers up little to ponder. Many of the sets resemble video game backgrounds -- not surprising since the action also looks much like what you would see were you looking over the shoulder of some game-playing 12-year-old. Why bother making a movie? Go straight to the game. The fights are boring because Neo always triumphs. There's no suspense. For example, after fending off an ant-like invasion of attack robots before flying off into the sky, one has to ask: why didn't Neo fly away right at the start?

My head hurt from trying to absorb all the info that comes from this movie.I'm not going to go into any details because this movie is still in theatres and not everyone has had a chance to see it. All I can say is PAY REAL CLOSE ATTENTION WHEN PEOPLE ARE TALKING. Theres a lot to absorbBut I thought this movie was awesome. Some people say it's considerably different from the first, but isn't a sequel supposed to be? Sure, it didn't seem to be as fun as the first, but it's still a damn good movie. The reason why it wasn't as fun as the first is because we don't have Neo learning as the movie progresses. What made the first movie fun was learning along side of Neo. Now that he's ""Superman"" we sorta have to learn for ourselves.I'm going to see it again, and try to figure out what in the world was happening plot-wise. There was alot I didn't catch, but that's not the movie's fault. the 3 year old kid sitting next to me just HAD to go to the bathroom right when the IMPORTANT PARTS HAPPEN. He couldn't have held it for 2 minutes longer, or have gone during one of the super long (and super bad-ass) fight scenes. So I had to break my attention from the movie and let him and his dad get pass since the only seat available was on the aisle.

Having said that, I must say this is a good movie nevertheless.Good points: Deeper exposé of the fascinating concept of the Matrix. Some great stunts, new effects and choreography. Fairly good photography, visual impact and cinematography. Good sound effects. Acting is weak but fundamental to the original style. Weak points: 1.  Initial 20 min of the movie was too long, loosely edited, and did not add much to the plot. 2.  Last 10 min when Neo was communicating with the Source -- dialog was too fast, too profound, leaving no time for audience to digest the concepts. 
3. Overall dialog is rather inane, pedestrian; not as terse yet punchy as in the first  4. Fight scenes were too long drawn and similar, as were some of the other action sequences. The final outcome was always predictable; and Neo always ends up playing Superman to get out of the rut. His stoney facial expressions when he is flying, are also downright uninspiring.  
5. Plot development not well organised, although plot adds more delicious meat to the original concepts propounded by the first movie  
6. Many self-contradictory concepts introduced, leaving viewers incredulous. E.g. Neo being able to overcome death in the Matrix; Having ability to defy gravity yet still obeying it in the fight scenes, etc. I may have missed the deeper meaning behind such ""contradictions"" here, but hey, no fair explanation was proposed anywhere in the movie to ask us to give it the benefit of the doubt.7. Soundtrack was rather mundane.CONCLUSION Definitely a MUST-SEE if you loved the original movie. Definitely a MUST-SEE for the action scenes and those new to the sfx of the first movie. Repeat viewing is *strongly recommended* if you want to analyze the philosophical dogma at several points in the movie (discussions with the Oracle, the Source, the French ass). Overall, despite its substantial editing and directorial flaws, it is still a watchable movie given its lineage and our propensity to fully understand this fascinating concept called the Matrix.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

To me this is a top notch kung-fu movie and with the insane concept of humans being able to exist in a computer construct, only leaves the possibilities endless for creativity. That is one of the best parts of this movie and the first. That there are really no boundaries that they could cross and they don't. As far as style goes, very sleek, suicide doors are a nice touch, and there is a very nice contrast between the style of the real world(zion) and when their in the Matrix. There's awesome action, great kung-fu and fighting, and an intelligent and thought out story with solid characters and amazing, eye popping special effects. The Wachowski Brothers are geniuses.

So Matrix Reloaded is finally out and the general consensus seems to be that as always, it isn't better than its predecessor. While this may be true overall, Reloaded is still a fabulous film in its own right. I was afraid I might not enjoy it, having heard negative reports about it from friends who had rushed to see it but were a tad bit disappointed. Without giving too much away, the Zion gathering scene just left me scratching my head..I mean, it didn't need to be in the movie at all! Other aspects of the movie were awesome. The fight sequences looked a bit animated at times, but did not take away from the sheer breathtaking quality of the sequences. The twins, the Oracle, the Architect and Agent Smith were all minor players, but pretty convincing. I actually liked the fact that rather than being too heavy on the action, Reloaded deals with Neo's attempts to understand his role in the prophecy and his powers. As Agent Smith tells Neo, he's using all the muscles except the one in his head, coz he is yet to understand the full extent of his powers..The scenes with the Architect and the Oracle deal with this as well, and I was slightly taken aback by a certain revealation by the Architect in his talk with Neo..you'll know what I mean when you watch the movie. The ending as everyone will tell you leaves you hanging! Could have been done better but then again, what better way to whet audiences appetites than to leave them wanting more of the Matrix? Overall, I rate Reloaded 8 out of 10 or ***1/2 out of *****","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

""Empire"" was a success, however, because it concluded with a slam-bang revelation that was perfect emotionally as well as plot-wise: ""Luke I am your father.""

For the first while of the movie I thought it looked like most of the reviews were going to be right, just taking elements of the first movie and pushing them over the top (in the first movie Neo and Trinity kiss one time, in this one they have sex).  Well, in a way this is the case, but at the same time what was great about the first movie is still great in the second. The premise of the films raises some important questions from modern philosophy concerning sense-data (Is our perception of the world an authentic representation of reality?).  The first film as a whole turns out to be analogous to Plato's Cave from book VII of the Republic.  You could also read politics into it, and it's this openess that makes the story great.  Beyond having intellectual appeal, it was a special-effects and action film as well (one of the best), so it has a wide audience appeal. All of this still holds true in the second film! We already understand what the Matrix is, so they don't need to take any time explaining it again.  This one deals a lot more with the problem of free-will and determinism.  The implications of levels of reality were even more pronounced in this film, and the idea that principles from one level of reality hold true on other levels was put out (as above, so below).  The aspect that I thought was the best in this second film was how the different characters namely the Oracle, Agent Smith, Merovingian, Persephone, and the Architect, and how they related to the Matrix.

The high-tech visuals are stupid and the nature of the picture makes you wonder if any of the characters included are actual people or reasonable computer facsimiles.  This is big-budget, brainless entertainment that's virtually unbearable; no wonder the box-office fell so drastically and quickly after the first weekend of it's release!  So much of it is so bad that it's hard to pick a low point, but I'd say it's the grotesquely pretentious dance sequence that's so ridiculous as to be laughable; as if everyone was infected with the Debbie-Allen-Fame bug.  Carrie Ann Moss looks like Cloris Leachman, making the stuporific Keanu Reeves a perfect love interest for her (and intercutting their love scene with the Debbie-Allen dance number struck the perfect balance).

Neo has exercised his abilities. Agent Smith seemingly is growing stronger. and the universe is a LOT bigger than we had originally thought.I will refrain from telling you any details about the story, or how it develops, but it does lend heavily on the premise that you know what happened in the first episode.  Unlike many other sequels, this one does not remind you where you have been or what you have already seen.  That being said, if you think you might need a refresher course, you probably should watch The Matrix again before going to see it.There is no shortage of action in this film.  All well orchestrated special effects, (including the trademark Bullet-Time effect), well choreographed fight scenes (ala Matrix-style of course) and a superbly done chase sequence that could only have existed inside the Matrix itself.The great thing about inventing a world like the Matrix, is that the Wachowski Brothers can do pretty much whatever they want to inside this universe. Even better is that they don't over-do it and make it foolish. Even though in any other movie, it might be. here, it's all feasible and believable.By now you are aware that this story line aims to be a trilogy, with the third film being released this coming November.   Although the first film arrived 4 years ago, 2003 promises to be the year of The Matrix. what with two major motion pictures, a major video-game tie-in, and The Animatrix short film releases (currently online and with a DVD coming soon).
The Matrix Reloaded is a very comfortable fit as a sequel.  It's a good match, and is on-par with the first film.  It doesn't out-do its predecessor, but it does serve up a decent pay-off for the setup you were given already.   It also does well to lead us up to part three: The Matrix Revolutions (thankfully we don't have to wait another 4 years for that!)[Note: If you want a little more of a tease to help get you psyched up. stick through the final credits. There's a little surprise at the end you might enjoy. ]","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But keep in mind that this movie is not nearly as cool as Rage.  It built fairly nicely on the last movie.  The mythology of the Matrix was expanded, explaining more about the workings of the system.  Zion was explained in more detail as well.  Overall, this movie expands the experience of the Matrix.  It fills out what the first movie failed to express.The fight scenes were wonderful, even if many of them echoed the first movie.  Much of what I saw in a battle was the same as I'd seen before in this series; it was simply built upon (put into another background, fighting more people at once).  Another problem with the fight scenes was that when Keanu Reeves had a stunt double, you knew it.  The directors didn't even attempt to conceal it, often zooming in on an actor that was certainly not Reeves.  Yet, these problems could not ruin the coolness of the film.What did almost ruin the film was the cliched diologue.  Unfortunately this was most noticable in the major revelation toward the end of the movie. I won't say what happens, but be sure to have your dictionary ready if you don't have a great grasp of the English language.  And be sure to groan when you hear the truth.  Actually, the movie was full of cliches.  There was even a scene where the main characters travel behind a book case that hides a secret passage.Relationships in this movie seemed to be thrown around, never seeming to make sense.  There was a lot that did not progress the plot, which is a terrible shame.The final thing I have to complain about is the last thing you see before the credits.  I will only say this:  the ending is soap opera worthy. And when you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about.Overall, good movie.  Don't even bother to see it if you haven't seen the first (or didn't like the first).6/10 as a sequel; 3/10 as a stand alone","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Although there are things about The Matrix Reloaded that I like, the movie is so open-ended and riddled with gaping holes that it's virtually impossible to view this as a finished project. The Matrix Reloaded delivers what a segment of the viewing audience expects - visually dynamic action sequences separated by interludes of wordy, often pretentious exposition. The only real intellectual titillation comes at the end, when the storyline lurches forward in a moderately unexpected direction. There are, of course, a large number of fight scenes. These include some relatively ""simple"" (and not terribly energetic) ones - Neo fighting a few agents, Trinity trying to survive a vicious onslaught, Neo ""proving"" that he's ""The One"" to a skeptical guardian, etc. But there are also three big ones.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Here I think it focused too much on the action and too much on the real world with little emphasis early on with the matrix.  I think this happens because the Wachowskis naturally assume the viewing audience saw the first matrix(a problem with star wars:  attack of the clones).  While there was plenty of action, scenes like the car chase didn't make me feel on the edge of my seat like when Neo and Smith faced off while Sentinels burrowed into Morpheus's ship(though the ghost twins did show they could be worse than agents).  Fights were fun to watch but predictable(Neo will beat up everyone, while his friends will get their asses kicked). With regards to the end, I would have asked more questions about the origin of the matrix since that question could have been answered.  I'm not sure why Reloaded felt wooden to me, perhaps because the first one was a genuine piece whereas this film seemed forced.  Matrix: Reloaded was filmed just before Revolutions started filming which is a little worrying considering Revolutions could be the same as Reloaded.  As with Star Wars, I hope the finale is the best of them all.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Pardon the disclaimer, but I just mean to ensure the objectivity of my professional opinion as a critic. To put it short:  This was a Work Of ART!  There were, admittedly, certain sequences that could have been graciously omitted... One particular ""romantic"" sequence between Neo and Trinity comes to mind.  But other than that, the film was a delight! It also featured a number of new cast members (e.g. Sing Ngai, Lambert Wilson) that deliver no disappointing performances! Each character is tailored to fit his/her performing counterpart! Tha'ts how the best movies are written! The two real winning elements of the movie, as far as performances go, were the dialogue and the fights. In the way of dialogue, there are several hero-villain confrontations that simply intrigue with every passing word! There are also a few monologues from Morpheus and Councilor Hamann, played by TV's classic Anthony Zerbe, which convey the amalgamated tactical-religious thinking of the older heroes of the story! As far as the action is concerned, there are many new effects, the most impressive of which being Agent Smith's new cloning ability (imagine, if you will, an entire mob of Hugo Weavings...), and the mysterious Twins, who can phase into a ghost-like state. However, the real golden thing about the movie's special effects is that the movie doesn't drown itself in them! There is still a great deal of the movie's stunts that are done with old fashioned elbow grease and wire-harnesses! It is a cutting edge-action movie, but uses only what it digital effects need be used. To put it as simply as possible, the movie was enjoyable at every turn! Granted, it's a mind-full the first time. I couldn't sleep after my first viewing! But once you get past the twists and turns the plot takes, and see everything in its truest light... There is one ultimate twist (which I cannot spoil!) that leaves you cliffhanging! You will be waiting with no small level of anxiety for the grand conclusion that is ""the Matrix Revolutions"".","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I have had so many fruitful philosophical/theological/anthropological/scientific discussions in light of The Matrix, that I have been anticipating with much excitement where the W-Brothers were going to go from the end of the first movie.  In the first half of Reloaded, I started to feel a bit disappointed.....until I saw the last half.  The problem is that I do not believe that most people are going to be able to ""engage"" the Matrix at some of its most profound levels.....I could be wrong, but some of the philosophical ideas being dealt with (in my opinion) are not the type of background that most people have. Clearly, philosophically minded individuals will sense that there is deeper meaning, but I'm not sure that most will be able to appreciate the depth of the Architect and how fantastic his character is in this movie.  I've only seen it once so far, so I have to process the movie further myself.  But most of the reviews that rip this movie apart, i feel, just can't dialogue with it at the level of philosophical discourse it would require.  Obviously by writing this, I'm implying that I can to some degree, and that may sound arrogant.  But I do not intend it to be.  Some time ""calling a spade a spade"" is what we must do.  I'm in awe at someone who plays the guitar with much skill, and don't consider them arrogant to admit that they play it well.  Point being that I'm not attempting to ""poo poo"" others who can't see all this ""mysterious deep meaning"" in the movie......I'm just saying that it is my opinion that there are some philosophically beautiful ideas in this movie that I don't think the majority of people are able to dialogue with unless they were to do some background research themselves. Anyway, at its deepest levels, I find this sequel to be a success.  There were some corny scenes in the movie, and some corny lines.  But, I enjoy the movie as something of a center of dialogue, and as that, it remains amazingly dynamic and full of things to think about/consider. I like the idea of encouraging others not to go with HIGH expectations. Let the movie speak for itself.  Go in with an open mind.  Let the story unfold.  Be patient.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was flabbergasted with the amount of work they have put in it. This movie is definitely worth watching for sake of that. To me this movie seems to be a transition between the first part and the third part. The ending was very abrupt and some things which they told were very disturbing to my mind and it took a lot of thought to assimilate it. I liked most of the movie; especially the motorcycle chase in which Carrie Ann Moss (Trinity) was chased by the bad guys and the agents, Carrie Ann definitely knows how to drive a motorcycle (thanks to motion picture driving school).   Keanu Reeves (Neo) was very good and it seems that he has worked a lot for the fighting sequences, but his character in the matrix should have been pepped up a little, he seemed very pale giving a feel of an android, a tan would have worked for him. Another guy who caught my attention was agent smith; his character was pathetic by the way he was beaten up by Keanu (Neo). Believe me if you go to watch this movie, which you must do, you should go with an open mind, and think anything is possible otherwise you'll find it difficult to understand the theme. And surely after watching this movie you'll be left eagerly waiting for the third part.......","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It finally has arrive and I saw it on it's opening night and you can tell right off the bat that they spend a lot of money on it. Plus there are many actors/actresses, non-actors (such as Roy Jones Jr.) trying to get involve in the phenomenon.  A brief synopsis.  The Matrix Reloaded fine our hero Neo finally making it to Zion.   Him and Trinity (Moss) are now a bonafide item.  Our ubercaptain, Morpheus arrives in Zion like a prophet except not everyone believes in his vision, especially not his boss.  His boss believes in that sheer might and numbers will be the machines as Morpheus still believes that Neo is the one.  Meanwhile, our coolest villain since Darth Vader, perfect diction Agent Smith, finds himself new life, and just as the Beatles did, he decided to try a little help with his friends to get back at Neo.   Of course his friends are himself, and himself, and himself... so on and so on.
This movie has a heck of a lot of action and I do mean a ton of it. Some very expensive CGI effect, but, event though I hate to admit it, it does lack on plot.  I did think they overused the slow-motion camera a bit too much.  It seemed that practically every action scene had it in it.  A little something I like to call.. Matrix mode.  Needless to say I was still blow away by the stunts that I saw, particularly a highway chase that even John Frankenheimer(Ronin) and William Friedkin (French Connection)  would have liked (even though it was CGI'ed).  Keanu is still Mr.. wood when it comes to acting and if they ever make a movie about the life and times of Al Gore, I am sure Mr.. expressionless one can play Mr.. expressionless two.  But, for the Matrix Reloaded you really don't need the Oscar winning caliber performance.  All you need is a cardboard guy to give you a few whoa's here and there and Keanu fits perfectly in here.  Overall this is a gleeful, butter-popcorn munching, goobers eating big screen bonanza that did it's job of bringing entertainment from Hollywood to the audience at the megaplex and isn't that what's it all about.  Entertaining the masses.  Can't wait to see Matrix Revolutions and see more stuff get blown up in Matrix mode.  Film gets a B.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Yes, yes, I understand that the action sequences and etc were never before done, but that doesn't impress me much. I like story, and once again Matrix tried to survive on the solo purpose of it's action. The plot does thicken a bit, which was to say the least the most that impressed me about the movie. The motorcycle chase scene was absolutely stunning, and Neo's coat when he flies around was beautiful. The special effects were amazing, yes I will agree to that. But, you just can't have a movie that lives off special effects alone... at least not when it comes to what I enjoy in movies. I didn't feel any heat at all when it came to the love affair between Neo and Trinity. There is a scene where Neo and Trinity are having sex, while the rest of Zion is dancing in the temple to almost pop music. This did not impress me, and was probably the worst scene in the entire movie. And be forewarned they show Reeve's butt in this scene, cute as it may be, it wasn't needed in this movie. What I did like about this one that I hated about the last, was the story was thickened. You find out the truth about alot of characters, and about who Neo really is. Why he was ever allowed to be plugged into the Matrix to begin with. These parts made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside.From Www.geocities.com/bamm2u","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The action is fantastic.  I was gripping my seat alot more than i was in the first Matrix.  But increadible action was only a component of what made the original such a good movie; it also had love, betrayal, self realization and most importantly, a conclusion.  Reloaded introduces or i guess continues a underlying theme of choice vs. destiny which i thought was fairly well done.  It didnt alter my veiw of reality like matrix did and the only question i had to ask myself when i left the movie was ""did i miss something?"".  I realize i should take this with a grain of salt.  The middle child of any trilogy is handicapped by the lack of a true begining or ending and you really realize it in this movie.  I guess my biggest problem with this movie is that it has too many completely unexplained characters who theoreticly are pretty damn important and too many attempts at humor with a chris rock-esque comic foil.  All in all though, I did enjoy this movie and i plan to see it again in hopes of piecing it together and if nothing else, to see Neo go sick nasty on the agent smiths with a metal pipe.rating: 7 out of 10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With film fans being left with dry mouths since the conclusion of the first film this sequel was as hotly anticipated as the next instalment of a Star Wars movie, only without the annoying Ewoks. The idea of the Matrix is, if you remember, that the world as we know it is just a computer simulation, and our heroes Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus must fight to overthrow the machines that are taking over the earth. Now there is a new battle as the city of Zion, where the remaining enlightened people of earth inhabit, is under threat, and armies of sentinels (don't ask) are burying through the planet with mass destruction being their primary goal. But before you know it, Neo, Trinity and Morpheus mount a defence while fitting in some nifty kung fu fighting that even Bruce Lee would have raised an eyebrow at. Among those fighting Neo and Co is Agent Smith, who plagues Neo like a swarm of wasps at a picnic, the trouble is you never know which one to swot. This is because Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) is now one of hundreds, and his fight scenes with Neo provide some of the best moments of the film, as they exchange fists and one-liners with equal relish. However, one does beg the question as to why Neo doesn't simply fly off, as his new ability to fly everywhere would make it easier to avoid getting punched, a risky thing to happen, especially as Neo's sunglasses look particularly pricey. Among all the fighting and soul searching Neo finds time to meet the Oracle who informs him he'll have to find the Source, but for that he'll need the help of the Keymaker, a funny little fellow who reminded me of the character of Penfold caught up in a episode of Danger Mouse (albeit one with a slightly larger budget) And so before long there is more action than you could shake your popcorn at, in particular an incredible fight on a highway with characters jumping from truck to truck in jaw dropping style. And so is this film worthy of all the money and fevered attention? The answer is yes and no. The film works fabulously on the level on which it is being sold, that of an incredible computer game with Keanu Reeves as the main player. Reeves, along with Laurence Fishburne and Carrie Anne Moss are brilliant, as is Hugo Weaving, although their characters are not strongly enough written for you to worry for the hero's safety, the whole MTV feel of the film suggesting it maybe wouldn't be cool to do so. This is a film that has more money spent on it than the national debt but is also one that has no heart (although your own heart will beat so fast that you probably won't notice) And so this is where the film's weakness lies, this being that if you look past it's glittering surface you might just find it rather empty, a film much like the Matrix itself, something that gives the illusion of being one thing while being entirely another.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity are the new Luke, Leia, and Han Solo, with Morpheus doing double duty as a New-Age Obi-Wan. Zion was what I expected, dark and beautiful. I  liked the gathering/love scene. It came off like the people of Zion felt, ""Aye, if we are going to bite it, might as well have some fun.""Now for the not so good news. There are scenes were the much-hyped CGI FXs are at times wonderful, but at times Stevie Wonder could see the difference. The big fight scene between Neo and the Agent Smith clones was decent, but you could also tell were CGI came in and real Neo left off. There were also times that I thought I was watching Luke Skywalker, and everybody who saw the film knows what I mean.And then, there was the story. Some of the dialog was nice. It gave a me a feeling of interesting character dynamics at work. The tension between characters was defined at times, but, some of the plot points will leave you looking for your own Oricle to ask her, ""what the hell does that mean?"" And, the final dialog scene between Neo and a certain character will need more than one viewing to get the meaning of.All in all, it was a very good effort, but, I think the brothers W thought more about big action in spots, and left the viewer hanging with long-winded explanations. *** out of 5.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

First of all i was a little disappointed after seeing it, seems like they got somebody else who hasnt watched the first to write this movie, the last movie left use with Neo all powerful and able to destroy agents at will,  this was always going to be the problem with this movie because with Neo being all powerful who is left to confront him, so they got around this by adding rogue programmes, multiple agent Smiths, and the Twins, fair enough. but while the main buzz of the last film was watching Neo in the Matrix this one centers too heavily on the real world and Zion, this also is fair enough. But then the inconsistencies come in, now all of a sudden everybody can fight agents and escape,in the last movie if you didnt run you died, Neo's powers are not as strong as the last movie would lead you to believe as he does have a problem fighting a few characters in this one e.g. the Oracles bodyguard, rogue programmes make him bleed etc. But the real let down is the finale with the  Architect of the Matrix, first we are now lead to believe the ""The One"" was by design between the Oracle(yeap shes really a baddie) and the Architect to filter out all those who have powers like Neo (of which there are 6 to date) and have them make a choice. 1 Sacrifice themselves and this will call off the attack on Zion and the Matrix goes on as normal or 2 retreat as cause the destruction of Zion(or in Neos case save Trinity). He is also told that to destroy the Matrix would result in the deaths of all humans connected to it(Why didnt anybody else think of this).All of ""The Ones"" to date have sacrificed themselves for the better good but not Neo who ends up saving Trinity by manually pumping her lifeless heart which if you think about it is actually a computer representation of her heart so how does that work? Anyway neo then leaves the Matrix to confront the Squiddies, but wait a minute here to in the real world he can stop them with the flick of a wrist Hmmmm... now either the real world is also a part of the Matrix which means everybody is still jacked into it (this could get very confusing) or Neo has got powers in the real world too, which is amazing for somebody who was just a good hacker. I think the latter could really be the downfall of the trilogy.Anyway the movie does end like a 2 part episode of Dallas with a ""To be Concluded...."" message but the real disappointment was not getting to see the face-off between the Twins and Neo which is obviously going to be a big part of the 3rd movie. The point of Reloaded is to keep you from having one until you watch the 3rd movie. I cant help feeling a 3 hour sequel would of been better then a 2nd and 3rd movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Don't end a movie like that.Now for the good stuff:This one was so different, that it almost can't be compared to the first one.  I liked seeing Zion, because now we know what they are really fighting for.  Just imagine the poverty and life they have there.  But think of the images of who Neo is to them.  He is their true hope, the one thing they can think of when they need it most.I liked the cameos of the other characters from both the Animatrix and the first movie.  It helps give the story depth.This one really tackles the subconscious mind and what can it really do. When the crew is on the surface and Neo stops the sentinels, there was a definite subconscious change in him, and what he knew.  He no longer used his conscious mind to make decisions he went the next step.This leaves so much unanswered and thankfully Revolutions will be out in a short while.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was stylish, fast and unbelievably cool. For the matrix reloaded i had high expectations. I thought joel silver was mabye being a tad big headed when he said the film would ""end the way movies are made"" but after watching the movie, i realise that pretty much every other action movie with the exception of the first Matrix, hasn't got a patch on ...Reloaded. From the mind Blowing opening to the 'burly brawl' and all the set pieces in between the matrix is a rip roaring thrill ride. The philosophical discussions although a bit mind boggling do actually make sense. The highlight of the movie, though, is not the freeway (worth the admission price alone) or the stairway fight but (for me) the short but undeniably poetic almost dance like fight between Neo and Seraph (the Oracles' bodyguard) it is truly well choreographed. So to finish the Matrix Reloaded is beyond anything you will see this year (no mean feat as T3 and the Hulk are being released this year). Stop Reading.Go see reloaded.

The ONLY redeeming part of the movie was the freeway scene. Excellent action that was not overdone by bad digital imaging such as the courtyard scene. I felt that I was watching a video game through most of the movie and a poorly developed one at that.I also don't mind sex in movies when it makes sense, but the sex in this movie was out of place. For instance, when Morpheus, Trinity and Neo went to look for the Keymaker, they were in a restaurant that had a Frenchman in it that was discussing the following: (gist) ""...people continue to do things even though they don't know why..."" Essentially, people will continue to do things (even those that may be harmful to you) and you cannot explain why. Unfortunately, Hollywood reared it's ugly head and they put a blonde in there that had an orgasm from eating cake. Now I took a poll of about 15 people sitting around me when the show was over and NO ONE understood why that was in there. If she had continued to eat the cake and knew that she was going to die...then THAT would have illustrated his point. Not to mention Neo kissing the French woman in front of Trinity. WHAT THE HELL DID THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ANYTHING?!?!?!?! It wasn't sexy, it was uncomfortable and out of place.THE MATRIX HAS GONE HOLLYWOOD! The first one was fantastic. This one sucked. I want my money back. I will not buy the second DVD. Also, most of my friends have decided to wait until the DVD comes out and is a 5 day rental before seeing it. I'd advise you do the same.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","The good points, the bad points.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0704430/?ref_=tt_urv","priestess_jane","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1831492/?ref_=tt_urv","24 May 2003","Okay, I've seen tons of sequels, ALL OF WHICH ruined the perfect original idea. So naturally, I understand that it's incredibly hard (if not impossible!) to make a sequel for the matrix as good as the first, primarily because everyone already knows the basic plot. So I expected it bad... but surely not THAT bad!!!Summery of the whole film: no gullable/believable. That's what's wrong with it!Things wrong with it: BEGINNING: I know most people commented on this. It's utterly long and feels much more like Star Trek than a more thought-provoking first matrix film.SEX/DANCE SCENE: This should have NEVER made it past the editors. I mean, they're together - you don't have to SHOW it. What's the point? Things like that are not only boring, but the characters somehow lose their appeal. Instead of this 'perfect love' there should have been something challenging it.BLUNT SCRIPT: Morpheus lost his appeal completely. His philosophies are simply dry now that the viewer knows everything. It's called 'trying to make a character look smart'. It actually does nothing of the sort. It's true that, towards the end, even the last matrix film had a few bad moments in the script... nothing compared to this though.TOO MANY CHARACTERS: WHO were all those people? Do I care about any of them? They should have never brought us to that city. It's much more intimate and concentrated on that one ship. I remember in the first film when they first came into the matrix with Neo their costumes were so nicely matched, but now they're just all over the place and EVERYONE is wearing shades! I do like Neo's coat though... it was THE ONLY truly cool garment in the film.TOO MUCH ACTION: The producers don't realise that the last film only benefited from the action. In other words it was a bonus. The matrix was built around a good plot which unfolded slowly. This movie seems to think that the more explosions and fake computer sequences they have the... what?... 'cooler' it will be? Do they think that we're BLIND? Plus in this film the action is already expected. You can just see them getting ready to fight. It's just boring....EFFECTS: VERY overdone. There's nothing more to it. If something is made to impress it will surely not impress you.AGENT SMITHS SCENE: This scene was so lame. One of the worst. There was no suspence either. You knew all the way through that Neo wasn't going to die. Plus the effects were a bit boring and far too many. All I was thinking for the whole 5 minutes was ""WHY DOESN'T HE JUST FLY OF????"" What was the point of that sequence? Plus the setting was so obviously chosen for S/F effects.TOO LARGE A SCALE: Everything in this film was so overdone that I don't even know where to start. Far too many explosions. Neo trying to save the world, flying around like superman... etc. etc. etc.FRENCH COUPLE: The guy blabbed on and on. It was annoying and pointless really. Especially that cake part. SO stupid!!! And then the woman coming asking Neo for a kiss with some lame reason. That was just cheap and Trinity's reactions of protest were simply laughable. If they tried to make us laugh until we're afraid or something, they failed miserably.SUMMARY: The first hour is not worth mentioning. It was simply a badly constructed plot. Too many random and small ideas. Far too many random villians. Not much suspense. Not much emotion or attempt at real characterisation or any sort of development. SO MANY scenes needed to be deleted or started from scratch! Neo was just sulking all the way though. The end was a joke! It made me feel like I was watching LoTR all over again (thank God I missed the otehr two parts)The Good points: KEYS/WHITE CORRIDOR: This actually had some potential. I really liked the white corridor scenes because it gave an extra dimension to the matrix. that was actually one of the best ideas in the film. Imagine how easy it would be for Neo to get lost there. What if he got locked inside? I think they just didn't present or develop this idea enough at all.ARCHITECT/CENTRE: That was also a fairly good idea, though giving him a face might have been a mistake. All I know is that by that point in the movie nothing would have improved it. The 'architect' did reveal some new info (finally!), but I found myself loosing attention on his long speech. If that was the climax of the movie, I would have to laugh very hard! They could have done much more of this.TRYING TO LINK FILMS: They TRIED. I heard some familiar sounds, especially in the beginning and they tried to start it the same way.... sadly it all amounted to nothing. As I said - it's really hard to make a sequel if you're planning to re-create the original thing.SUMMARY: fresh ideas are very sparse and are definitely not brought to their full potential. This movie lacks any kind of real emotion.Remember, just my opinions.... but I felt I could have made a better movie than the one they did. I've seen a lot fo sequels in my time and I can safely say: ""I wish they hadn't made this one and ruined such a good original classic they had""Jane Moss","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Lacks Everything That Made Its Predecessor An Instant Classic","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3131236/?ref_=tt_urv","CinemaClown","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20018357/?ref_=tt_urv","26 November 2014","Opening with a sequence that was just an indication of stupider things to come, The Matrix Reloaded discards the carefully structured premise of The Matrix, replaces it with a fairly complex but far too messy plot filled with nonsensical philosophies, and is far too concentrated on its action spectacle & visual effects than the storytelling elements, yet failing to do justice to either aspects.Set six months after the events of the first film, The Matrix Reloaded continues the rebellion of free humans against the machines & the journey of Neo in finding a way to end the war before it's too late. With only 72 hours remaining before an army of sentinels reaches Zion, it's up to Neo to find a way soon but standing in his way is an old foe who is now more powerful than ever before.Written & directed by the Wachowskis, the highly anticipated sequel is unfortunately no match to its predecessor & is a convoluted mess from start to finish that gets too carried away with its themes. However, there are still moments of great imagination in few sequences & the visual presentation is pretty neat as well. But it all doesn't stack up in the end & it largely remains a bloated, uninteresting affair.Cinematography somehow manages to maintain a level but is doesn't add anything to the groundbreaking feat it managed to achieve the last time. Editing isn't up to the mark for it is unable to provide a smooth flow & fails to trim moments that linger for way too long. VFX is a mixed bag as few effects-laden scenes look too cartoony while others are spellbinding. But Don Davis once again chips in with an amazing score.Coming to the acting department, there isn't a single performance worthy of mention & even the new additions bring nothing new to talk about. Action choreography ranges from borderline ridiculous to downright awesome, with my favourite sequence being Neo's fight with Merovingian's men which in my opinion is perfectly blended with other elements, especially the score, & despite being over the top, is incredibly exhilarating.On an overall scale, The Matrix Reloaded feels like a sequel written in hurry to cash-in on the success of the original. There are few interesting ideas present in its story but the film lacks the consistency & discipline when it comes to implementing them. It tries to do too much, throws a lot of questions at the viewers without offering any sort of explanation & lacks everything that made the first chapter an instant classic.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The visuals are artistically and creatively stunning.Also this matrix film does what any sci-fi trilogy film should do: it creates a rich and complex alternative world for us to believe in.  The world of the matrix isn't just interesting in terms of gadgets, personalities or possibilities; it plays with a set of meaty coherent ideas about what would happen in society of machines and leaves you with lots of basic philosophy to chew on.A final plus is of course the martial arts, which have no other hollywood film (with the possible exception of charlies angels) have done nearly so well.Unfortunately the matrix reloaded also has it's problems.  The main protagonist, Neo (Kean Reaves) come over as a fairly two dimensional character - he looks great, fights beautifully - but doesn't manage to squeeze much depth of character in between the set pieces.  The same can be said for the rest of 'goodies', except for link (Harold Perrineau Jr.) who actually comes across as a really 3D human.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The W. brothers were given FAR too much money (for which the fans can blame only themselves--in Hollywood, revenue is all that talks, and all those repeat viewings and DVD purchases bought us *this* movie), and they have far too many ideas that they are not skilled enough to express well.  There are too many characters, too many subplots, and just generally too much overall.  This is the way of the sequel, it ever has been and ever will be.  Bigger, louder, more--that's Hollywood's motto.Reloaded at least *attempts* to be about something deeper than ""boom crash boom slap boom smack pow pow pow fifth-grade joke.""  It doesn't succeed all that well for a good part of its run time, but I for one appreciate the attempt.  There are constant endless complaints that Hollywood only makes stupid movies and never takes SF seriously--and now here's a movie that takes its SF seriously and tries to not be stupid, yet everyone's still complaining.I enjoyed the film, more on second viewing (and would like to see it on the big screen at least once more).  I'm annoyed by the ""more"" factor (the movie's way too loud and busy), and frustrated by how no single storyline can get the attention it needs because there are too many, and quite well aware that most of the philosophy is pretentious gobbledygook.  But I'm able to take it as what it is:  an expansion of a world particular to the brothers' viewpoint that has a lot of pretty eye-candy and 'splosions to tart it up.  And I'm having a grand time geeking out with friends who also enjoyed it and playing the ""what do you think this means?"" game.  That's what a good action/SF film should achieve, and if people could shove aside their crushed expectations for fangeek orgasm and look at what the movie *is*, they'd see that Reloaded is a good action/SF film.  Not a great one, most definitely not...but a good one all in all.  (Unless, of course, one thinks such delights as Extreme Ops and 2Fast 2Furious are what we should be aspiring to in our action films.)And speaking of orgasms, I'm absolutely *fascinated* by the widespread revulsion for the sex (and suggestions of sex) in the film.  Was the sex necessary?  Probably not.  But I didn't find it particularly out of place or poorly done (there is less flesh on display than in an average teen comedy). As for the Zion Dirty Dancing Party, apparently the notion of connection and celebration in defiance of fear is an alien notion to a lot of people. A life well lived will inevitably include the pleasures of physical and emotional connection with other human beings, and the crux of the conflict in the Matrix universe is that of ""real"" human experience vs. artificial. It would seem that a whole lot of people are deeply disturbed by this thought, which makes me wonder how many people are truly living their lives well.I have seen better action and SF films than The Matrix:  Reloaded.  I have also seen far, far worse ones.  I appreciate being given the chance to share this vision the Wachowski brothers have, jumbled and poorly-formed as it is. And that was all I ever expected from this movie.  I don't go looking for God in movie theaters, and no one else should either.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

More fights, more laughs, more cars (indeed *some* cars, if we are to define 'cars' as 'cars that have a part to play in the film'), all contributing to a well-formed tasty morsel of wham-bam summer entertainment that deftly introduces themes of Idealist philosophy and the illusion of free will (cf. Honderich 1988, Satre 'Existentialism and Humanism' 1948). Like a junk-food banquet where the starters are all nunchucks and by the time you've tucked in your napkin, your brains are on the floor. In the advice of this humble reviewer, go sign yourself up to Matrix camp and before you go, take care to pack your brain - since heavy dialogue comes thick and fast and the directors aren't afraid to be 'in your face' with their philosophy. Indeed, Monica Belluci proves she can act in yet another language. The film is full of surprises. I won't ruin it, only expect the unexpected, rather as Bond did in the hall of mirrors at the end of 'The Man With The Golden Gun'. Instead of Christopher Lee guiding you, however, there are other shadowy characters, and explosions, and bullet time here and there that will remind you where 'Scary Movie' went all wrong.

We heard that somewhere in the movie right. =)But this time, for the first time Neo choses the door on the right, because of love.The architect says that Trinity is going to die if he choses that door. Well, he saves her life, but will she die cause the matrix is going to freed and the earth is uninhabitable?Was she created cause the time is near that the earth might be livable soon? But its not ready just yet? Or is it ready.  But if its ready, why would everyone try to get Neo to chose the door on the left?But now Agent Smith is a virus, and he has the ability to destroy the Matrix as well.  Which is why Neo must become an anti-virus and destroy him.  To keep the Matrix alive...My money is on the following:We are ready to live in the real world.  Hence Trinity was created.  To make Neo chose the door on the right.  But one final battle remains.  Neo v.6.0 against Agent Smith.If Neo wins, being the one, he can free the matrix, and we can live on earth again, but if agent smith wins - the virus' take over the matrix and destroy it, and with it, humans chance to repopulate the earth.That is the final battle: simple as that.Tim","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Make a sequel to the perfect movie. The Matrix had the perfect story, perfect plot, perfect lines, perfect effects and so on. Well, about as close to perfect as one can come.And then this. Had I been dead, I would have turned in my grave. Never have I seen a movie with such good starting terms become such a mess. Completely deprived of a good storyline, full of flat characters. In short, everything you expect from a tuesday movie on any cloned tv network.But, one has to give credit to some of the choreography, effects and sound. Even they can't carry a movie alone, it seems this was the idea behind this creation. Fight scenes were pretty good, effects were very well done except some really big bloopers, like i.e. the slow-motion scene with the agent landing on the hood of a car, which looked like a cheap version of Spiderman-effects. But all in all, good effects.If the second sequel to The Matrix is going to be as flat and stillstanding as this one, I'd rather watch Dr Phil on TV. Or, for all I know, I may be the one that needs his help. Anyways, I was very much disappointed in this movie. Had it only had a proper storyline and a good plot along with some interesting characters, I could've easily forgotten about the effects bloopers and other small flaws. But no cigar I guess.Well, let's all hope the next one can at least live slightly up the the first in this trilogy. Then maybe I'll get my respect for the Bros back.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I've got just one thing to say. FFS will you get a grip of yourselves! The movie only elaborates and expands on what it started in the first film and it doesn't do it to excess. What about all the ""What is real"" ""How do you define real"" type scenes in the first movie, no one complained then. Theres only maybe one or two scenes that serve to set up a Memento style feel about how the movie and and the next one will progress. I thought it was great how Neo turned out to be only 1 in a line of other ""anomalies"". I can't help but shudder thinking about the Playstation generation who can't concentrate on anything for more than a millisecond.I mean seriously... whining at the Matrix for being too philosophical!

In the late 70s and 80s it was Star Wars saga.  From there it was back to the Future Parts one, two, and three.  The Star wars saga again in the 90s, and now in 2003 we will see the completion of the Lord of the Rings trilogy and a double installment of the Matrix.  . But for now let's just take a look at The Matrix ReloadedNow freed from the computer generated world known as the Matrix, Neo played by Keanu Reeves, is now charged with fulfilling the prophecy that will free all of mankind from being used as a power source for the free thinking machines that currently rule the Earth.  While Neo tries to figure out how to do that time is against the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar as the machines are planning an attack of their own by launching a huge assault against Zion, the last remaining human city buried deep in the Earth.Without giving away the more interesting parts of Matrix Reloaded I will say it's a lot of Kung Fu.  In the first Matrix movie there were two major fight scenes. in Matrix Reloaded it's about two thirds fight scene.A question that was answered about the Matrix Trilogy itself is way release two in one year?  My theory is because part two isn't a complete movie. If part one told you what the concept of the story was and who the good guys are, part two shows you a little more and tells you who the bad guys are. If part three wasn't due out only months after the release of Matrix Reloaded the series might have been in trouble.  Honestly it felt more like I was watching an episode of the Matrix and not a sequel movie.  The fact that they show the trailer for part three after the credits end adds to that.The special effects in Matrix Reloaded are awesome and flawless on the big screen, and the look of the film could keep a room full of pretentious film students analyzing it for months.  There is defendant symbolism between the controlled and conformed life style of western civilization and the matrix as well as the repressed yet more spiritual city of Zion and Eastern civilization.  Along the same lines I really enjoyed the diversity of the characters.  There's lots of gender, age, and color and every one of them strong.Matrix Reloaded fulfills its duty as the middle of a trilogy, but doesn't quite fill up like Empire Strikes Back did. Because I don't feel Matrix Reloaded in a complete movie, but a two part movie I'm forced to mark it down.I'm giving it four out of five stars Remember you'll have to see it anyway, so you can follow the story line in part three in Novemberfor movie scene I'm Dan Hemme","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But yet Smith, an agent from the first movie has been taken away from his agent place as he was in the first movie, because of Neo killing him, but yet he comes back and is also trying to get to the ""source"" which is the person who created the Matrix.Anyway I think this whole plot was stupid, this movie had some unneccesary scenes, and I REALLY fell asleep twice through this movie, I think anyone who likes boring movies, will love this one.

The fight on top of the 18 wheeler looks totally fake. I never believed for a second they were moving down the highway. Their clothes don't ruffle in the wind like they should. There really is NOTHING new in reloaded! Like most other people I like the Ducati, the Keymaker and the Oracle, plus I did enjoy the Architect scene. There is less than zero chemistry between Trinity and Neo. Who cares? In the end they just pile on the CGI so much that it really does drown in it. There is no life in the film. No magic.

As it progressed, more and more action was added in, finally ending with a cliffhanger. I would recommend this movie to people who have seen the first one, definitely, because it clears up some things that the first one left unexplained. Also, it reveals a lot about the Matrix itself. I would also recommend this to teens and young adults, probably some older adults too. This movie has it all. Romance, Action, Adventure, Mystery, Comedy, EVERYTHING.

As I sat through 2 hours of this movie I had mixed emotions.  On one hand I really enjoyed the Martial Arts in this movie.  The fight scenes were way more better than the first Matrix (which is usually the case with any action movie with more than one installment.) I was on the edge of my seat as I watched Keanu Reeves fight Agent Smith and any other bad people.  However, there seemed to be something lacking from this installment that was present in the first movie.  Then it hit me; a good plot was missing from this movie.  The movie, in my opinion, never really went anywhere.  They never really defined any of the new characters positions in the movie.  I knew who the bad people were and who were the good people.  But, just when they seemed to focus on one thing they skipped to something else.  So there never was a real flow in the movie.But all-in-all, the movie was good.

As we have been presented this year, sequels can definetley ruin the original movie. This one not only ruined it, but also made the story boring with no end in sight. The scene where neo fought the agent smiths was unnecessary and completely ridiculous. We could have watched that scene for hours upon end before we would gain anything. I wasn't even impressed by the special effects and the fighting. From that point on I noticed that almost half of this movie could have been taken out because there were so many scenes that didn't change the plot or introduce anything interesting to the viewers. As a hardcore movie goer I was thoroughly p***ed off at the directing. This movie could have started with the first fifteen minutes and ended immediatley with the architect introduction. To me it seemed as if the Wachoski brothers thought that the audience actually cared about the plot. And from what i hear from my friends, family, and other people...they didn't. Although true Matrix fans and action movie fans probably liked it... to me it seemed as if this movie brought down my liking of the original Matrix.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

""It Stunk"". Peeee-eewww was it bad. The only people who can be happy about this movie are the executives at Bolle and Ray Ban. The movie was an over long advertisment for sunglasses.  Some people say you should never name call in a review or even swear. Fortunately I'm not one of those people. The movie was craptacular on the highest scale.If you like fast car chases and lots of shooting. Then I recommend seeing ""The Fast and the Furious"" or ""Gone in 60 Seconds - (a homage to Peter Mack)"". If you are looking for romance then go see ""Star Wars Attack of the Clones (with its totally believable love interest between Anakin and Princess Amidalla -wink wink, yes totatlly believable). The fact is, The Matrix Reflushed fails in every respect. The romance between Neo and Trinity is as unexplainable as the Trinity itself. The action scenes looked like they were rehashed versions of the original Matrix film but lagged on for about 10 minutes too long.And this is no criticism of the movie, but somebody let one rip during the movie and it stunk out the cinema. It was the inspiration of my review ""The Matrix Reflushed"".I have never walked out of a movie and I have seen ""Liar Liar"" so enough said, but the Matrix takes the cake as being the first movie that I even considered walking out of.Verdict: Keep flushing","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Chicago's Wachowski Brothers, after revealing the penultimate in special effects with 'bullet-time' (the scenes of morphed time and space where the actor or actress can dodge bullets or suspend themselves in mid-air while the camera pans around them), showcase the next level of SFX in their evil pair of ""ghosting"" programs - the Rayment Twins.  Not only are the special effects...well...spectacular, but the plot evolves the entire storyline of the blossoming trilogy.  In this second installment, we learn that Zion itself is in danger.  The machines have discovered it's location and are burrowing through the Earth to reach it.  Several ships are asked to remain behind inside the Matrix to wait for word from the Oracle.  On top of all that, Neo begins having prophetic nightmares about Trinity's fate.For a guy who is known more for his looks than his acting, Keanu Reeves once again pulls off the acting job for Neo brilliantly.  Perhaps this part was made for him, or he was meant to play it.  Perhaps the part may could have been played by any other actor.  That will be debated for sometime.For all it's glitz and glamor, The Matrix: Reloaded still has room for a storyline that would work without the special effects.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The problem with evaluating The Matrix Reloaded is that you also must take into account what is yet to come, since Reloaded is only half a movie.That having been said, what is on the screen for The Matrix Reloaded is a padded-out, self-indulgent, self-important load of crap.True, the special effects and action sequences are beyond state-of-the-art, and if that's all you're seeing the movie for, you won't be disappointed. But whereas the first Matrix challenged us to re-examine our own definitions of reality, Reloaded gets so bogged down in its own mythology that it leaves the audience (at least the members not trapped in their own ""matrix"") to ultimately wonder, ""Who gives a damn?"", specifically about a plot that the filmmakers are trying so solemnly and so earnestly to sell.I'm curious to see Part III, if only to see how the filmmakers will justify the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on creating and hyping this lead balloon of a movie.""The Matrix"" was a landmark film.

First off, there is a ton of action which doesn't necessarily take away from the plot it just distracts a little.  However, that is not to say the the action isn't good, and I do believe it for the most part to be necessary.  I believe this to be the reason that people think the plot is weak. But, if one pays close attention, he/she will see that the story is riddled with plot developments throughout.One thing that is a new development and crucial to this story (and probably the third part too) is how agent Smith finds a way out of the matrix. What happens is...(at this point, if you haven't seen the movie you may wish to stop reading) agent Smith has found a way to copy himself.  So he uses this ability to copy himself to a human that is just about to exit the matrix. He copies himself, and then picks up the telephone and exits the matrix, thus giving himself a consciousness outside the matrix and another way to foil the humans.  He later becomes responsible for setting off an EMP before all of the Zion's ships are in place for their ""counter-attack"" and thus downing five ships right away.  However, he is not killed in the attack by the machines, which leaves copious doors open for the third movie.Another interesting development related to this, and probably overlooked quite often is the new relationship between Neo and Agent Smith.  Agent Smith tells the audience that something strange took place when Neo killed him. He is now set free. In my opinion this means that he can now freely operate aside from the machines. He is not compelled to follow machine orders. He has already disobeyed the machines once that he tells us about, by not returning to the mainframe for deletion.  But, what is interesting out of all of this, is what I believe, Agent Smith and Neo have now become. It has to do with the manner that Neo killed Smith.  In the first movie Neo, in order to kill Smith, jumped inside his body and in effect blew him up. This actually may have caused some kind of small joining of the two. That is, some of Smith rubbed off onto Neo, and some of Neo rubbed off onto Smith. This would explain how Smith is now ""set free"", and how Neo can stop the sentinels at the end. Let me explain. If some of Smith had rubbed off onto Neo this would give Neo an inlet to communicate with the machines. It isn't a strong line of communication, but it is nevertheless a way that Neo can see into the machine world. This is touched on briefly earlier in the movie when the Oracle tells Neo that he has the sight. What she means is that now he can see what is going to happen in the matrix just like the rest of the machines. But more obvious is when Neo, Morpheus, Link and Trinity are trying to escape the sentinels at  the very end of the movie, and Neo says ""wait, there is something different"".  It would seem that Neo can sense something about the ""squidies"". What happens next appears to be some kind of witchcraft fairytale type trick, but what it may actually be is Neo's machine part ""communicating"" and shutting them down.  I can't say for sure obviously, but my point is there is much more plot development than one would think by just watching it.In closing, let me suggest just listening to the dialogue, forget the action (which is hard to do, I admit) for just one viewing and really listen to the dialogue. We learn a great deal about how the machines operate and also a great of how the humans may or may not actually defeat them. Just don't watch it and walk away saying, ""great action, but weak plot"". If you do, you have missed the whole point of the movie, and you're an idiot.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The set design for Zion was just absolutely fabulous. I've read some weren't impressed with the storyline. I, however, found it intriguing and in keeping with the Matrix theme. To me, anything else simply would have been a cop-out and not held up to the ""feel"" of the movie in and of itself. I won't say more for fear of spoiling it for anyone.Now, I have to admit, I was a bit disappointed with certain scenes. The CG was just entirely TOO obvious and, at times, looked like the animatrix rather than the Matrix. Had I been watching an animated version, I'd have been impressed, but since this was supposed to be ""real people"", it only detracted from the experience for me...but not much. Furthermore, some of the fight scenes WERE a bit overdone; but at the same time, I would have been seriously disappointed had Neo wiped out Smith in a kick or two. So, again, this didn't detract much from the overall experience. However, one aspect of the movie DID grate on my nerves...the unnecessary fight scenes thrown in just to...well, have a fight scene. This definitely got old after a while.Aside from some of the minor flaws, Reloaded was incredibly entertaining. With humor, action, good acting, wonderful scenery, and awesome special effects, Reloaded proved it can hold up to its predecessor. It's difficult going into a movie where you KNOW there's going to be a third one and you know who will be IN the third one...leaves little room for surprises. Well, so you would think. Reloaded was able to look beyond its upcoming sequel and pull you into the here and now; surprising you with its little twists and turns. Bigger, Better, Brilliant.

It's a damned shame that they don't find some way to make it so that only people above a certain IQ could post comments on the internet.

	Matrix Reloaded was made by Wachowscy brothers, they are of Polish descent. The stars of this movie are: Neo  Michal from Poland, Trinity Kasia from Poland, Morpheus  Drew Still from England. Neo, Morpheus, Trinity, and the rest of their crew continue to battle the machines that have put the human race in the Matrix. Neo learns more about his super-heroic abilities, including the ability to see the codes of the people and things around him, and he also thinks that  he is a superman:) ( that is a stupid idea of the autors). Now, more humans are waking up out of the Matrix and attempting to live in the real world. As their numbers grow, the battle moves to Zion--the last real-world city and centre of human resistance. But in the end of the second part of the  Matrix human race loses the final fight with the machines, only Neo, Morpheus, Trinity and 2 men from their crew survive.

Bros. outdid themselves (especially the sfx scene where Neo rescues Morpheus & the Keymaker). This is what sci-fi/action films are all about. Take a bow, Mr. & Mr. Wachowski, because this franchise DESTROYS Star Wars.

In Star Wars, I cared about the characters, in the Matrix, I simply don't.. On a technical level, the movie is breathtaking, if nothing we haven't seen before. But that's just thing.In '99 the Matrix was a great story idea done adequately, bolstered by the best effects we've seen to date. It was disturbing and cool. flash forward to 2003, Matrix-Reloaded has the same effects (greatly amplified, but still the same). Since we've seen films like Fight Club, the disturbing, unsettling feel the first movie had is gone. What's worse, more than an hour devoted to the franchise's greatest weakness, character development and dialogue.Look, if agent Smith, basically a mathematical equation ,has more emotion and character than the humans, we have problems here. I mean, when everyone is wearing glasses, can you tell who is human and who is a machine? I didn't think so.I won't go over all the plot holes since I only have 1,000 words but the story just left me cold, the dialogue had me shaking my head and the pretension just  left me speechless. I am baffled by how some people will refer to the Matrix as some sort of philosophical awakening. I am all for thinking outside the box, but for god's sake, this is a Keanu Reeve's action film.  Give it a rest... please.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's good,yes,but not as stunningly original {Dark City,anyone?},nor as thrilling {a gunfight,a helicopter stunt and an unconvincing CGI kung fu fight,and that's it for action}as people made out.The first sequel,which was made back to back with the next film in what is now a trilogy,is in many ways a better film. The action is doubled on both quantity and quality. The several fights are much better staged,especially the humorous one between Neo and lots of Agent Smith's-yes,it's still mainly computer graphics but there is more wire work and actual martial arts skill in evidence. The centrepiece,a lengthy car chase incorporating fighting,is truly amazing. It's so exciting,well staged and thrillingly scored by Don Davis and Juno Reactor,that,for the only time in a Matrix movie you almost forget it's nearly all computer graphics,so gripping is the action. The effects are generally better and several non-action scenes work excellently,such as the much criticised 'rave'scene,which is actually totally appropriate.However,the film still has a few problems. Even more than the first film,several plot points seem to exist solely to complicate matters. The filmmakers were courageous to end the film with a metaphysical discussion rather than another big action scene,but why do the Warchowski brothers think they have to keep pulling the wool over our eyes? It's as if they got stuck in their story and decided to change it.Still,the best of the three. It's not a great sci-fi movie but it's certainly a terrific action film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The story dragged endlessly and if I had known how crap the movie was, I would never have gone. I know, I hadn't watched the Matrix but it isn't that I didn't understand the story. There were miles and miles of special effects and they were very good, without doubt. However, that does not make it a good movie.The story doesn't really progress until the last 5 minutes or so. I have to say, one think that spooked me were those two scary twin brothers. Great effects in the movie and I think that is what the movie was made of, instead of characters and a proper story. Heavily flawed, unfortunately.I would give the movie 1.3/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I've been a 'Star Wars' and 'Lord of the Rings' fan since I was ten, and people have disdained the two movie series a great deal. Admittedly, many 'Star Wars' fans are disappointed by the prequels, but I don't think the majority are. But that's how its reported in the media, which gleefully will deconstruct every movie to oblivion. So... if you think the Matrix had something unique to say about the human condition, then you're right and everyone else is wrong. Also, to all other fans who have a particular series of movies they like, I wish they would stop blasting other series of movies. Whether you think they are good or bad, at least they show an effort of time and devotion to them, something not seen in the vast majority of Hollywood fare...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I think they did also, BUT... I don't think they planned RELOADED the way they envisioned.  Because of the 1st Matrix success they were given the greenlight to make this one and the next (REVALUTIONS).  When they were given the greenlight they were so excited they threw everything but the kitchen sink in.  When commercialism is involved everything goes haywire. Soft drinks, beer.  Sheesh!!! This movie was good but not thought out enough.  They made sense but you'd have to be high to immediately understand it.  Persephone,  The Oracle, The Architect... all had their places but... Neo fighting the clan of Smiths was tooooo long and drawn out.  And the ending made me angry rather than anxious.  The preview after the credits revelead yet more nonsense.  It is worth seeing so you can make your own decision.P.S. The girl and the cake scene is cool.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I am not going to attempt to describe any scenes, as I do not think I would be able to do the scenes justice. I will say that the action scenes exceeded my expectations. The dramatic scenes were paced well, and fitted in the movie terrifically. However, as Morpheus put it, ""you have to see it for yourself""I will caution those who have not seen it - be prepared to leave the theatre with many questions left unanswered. With any luck all will be clear at the conclusion of Revolutions.My only complaint was sitting through the credits to see the trailer for Revolutions, only to watch a 30 second long trailer which didn't really show us anything. If I'd known in advance the trailer would be like that I'd have left before the [long, long] credits.A 9 out of 10 (would have been a 10 if not for the trailer at the end)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

CGI and live action are for the most part flawlessly intermixed.  The courtyard scene with Agent Smith(s) just keeps going, and going, and going.  And the amount of those visuals are also a magnitude higher.The martial arts displayed are (once again) a magnitude greater than the first film as well.  This film must have been a nightmare to choreograph. The love scene / party scene could have been chopped down a bit, but otherwise a solid action film all around.  And the film ends with a cliffhanger.  Our heroes are in a very bad way and the movie ends with ""To be concluded...""And a word to my fellow Matrix fans - BE SURE TO STAY THROUGH THE CREDITS. There is a trailer for the next film tied into the end of the credits depicting the final showdown you will definitely want to see.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The story drifted so far out of touch with reality that the first 30 minutes had me thinking of walking out.  The action and special effects than took over where the story had failed to catch my attention. But the fight scenes just kept going on for too long.  The bottom line is I have no desire to see the 3 rd movie.  This movie can't live up to the first because it's a repeat but with more of the same and a poor story to support the repetition of special effects action.The first Matrix had a story with real depth.

But still, i really liked the movie. Added together, all these sources made one hell of an entertaining movie. I had a lot of fun understanding the rules of that world. But now that i know the rules, it's not fun anymore. The MATRIX RELOADED is just the matrix on steroids, minus the discovery excitement. More characters, more explosions, more fights, none of which leads anywhere. The action sequences in the first matrix were fun because they were tightly connected with the narrative (take neo learning kong-fu for example). This time they lead nowhere. And dont get me started on the philosophical monologues in RELOADED. It's one thing to make a sci-fi cult film, but to think that you're making some intellectual statement about man and machine, and man's fate, please give me a break.I don't think they should have made a sequel. Of course, they'll make tons of money with that one, but who cares? Not me.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
