"5","/10","Pieces that work and pieces that don't","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8004095/?ref_=tt_urv","guskeller","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur88854575/?ref_=tt_urv","25 March 2022","The Lost City has pieces that work and pieces that don't. Placing pretenders into an actual adventure is good for laughs and heart, yet much of this script is generic. Unimaginative MacGuffins, flat villains, and predictable romances are individually forgivable, but together, they override the premise's charm. Furthermore, the dialogue, humor, and plot devices are subpar. The cast enhances the material (especially Pitt and Radcliffe), but some scenes are groaners. Tatum's charisma shines through and Pitt's cameo provides flavor, but that isn't enough to pull The Lost City out of mediocrity. It isn't painful, but The Lost City misses more than it hits.Meanwhile, The Lost City's filmmaking is average. Its minor positives are the cinematography (intermittently dramatizing comedy and action), the sound (selling the combat and jungle setting), the production design (primarily real but often computerized), and the effects (employing real explosions amongst the CGI). Conversely, the editing occasionally sags (lingering on unessential jokes) and the music is distractingly trendy (forcing fun, rather than serving the narrative). Lastly, The Lost City lacks cohesion. Its humor and emotions never tonally blend, and instead take turns (which disconnects viewers). Ultimately, The Lost City has mild appeal, but functions inconsistently.Writing: 3/10

Some of the sweeter, romance moments were maybe a little corny, but that's what was expected I guess.Nice special effects, it looks great, I loved the locations used. You can argue it had a somewhat old fashioned, maybe old school vibe about it, but sometimes you just need a bit of silliness in your life.Nicely acted, they all did a good job, Daniel Radcliffe was good fun, always enjoy his work.It really does make the most of Channing Tatum's looks, and it does work, he is ridiculously handsome, and there are several tongue in cheek moments, he seems like a good sport.7/10.","203 out of 281 found this helpful.

I was laughing more than most in the theater. There are so many well-written jokes and situational humor with about an 80% hit rate, including a few hilarious moments. The characters are fleshed out enough for me to care. The story is formulaic and relatively weak compared to the other aspects, but that's easily forgiven when it's making me laugh.In the second half, the laughs slow down drastically. It gets a lot more serious with attempts at character arcs and story moments that aren't bad but are things we've seen a thousand times. I didn't hate watching it, but without as much comedy it's a much weaker movie.The first half is easily seven stars. The second half is a weak six. I wouldn't mind watching this again but I wouldn't go out of my way to do so.

I remember a time when there was possibly a big comedy coming out every one or two months, with at least half of them being good, but in today's climate, humour is just tough to get right. I was very happy to see that Paramount would be taking a chance and releasing a big comedy in The Lost City this year, but I truly didn't know to what to expect from it. After seeing it in theatres, I'm happy to say that I had a good time with it. It's not great, but it felt like a throwback comedy, just with a modern twist.To put it simply, The Lost City follows Loretta (Sandra Bullock) as she's on a book tour with her cover model Alan (Channing Tatum) to promote the release of ""The Lost City of D,"" but they are swept up in a kidnapping and find themselves on a real adventure in the jungle. Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) is the reason Loretta was kidnapped in the first place, as he sees many similarities in her book to that of a real lost city. Being the privileged twerp that he is makes for a fun villainous storyline, even if it's pretty lame at times. Radcliffe aside (whom I still enjoyed), this film puts all of its weight on Tatum and Bullock to deliver the goods.This premise is clever enough to work as a film, but it all comes down to who you cast and if they can make the material work. I never thought I needed to see this duo together, but I'm very happy they worked so well. On top of that, I have to admit that the best moments in the film feature Brad Pitt's character Jack Trainer. He isn't in the film much, but every second he was on screen had me laughing. Where I found the film to be slightly uneven though, was in the fact that I wasn't sure if it wanted to be funny or dramatic at times.I'm all for heartfelt storylines as well as comedy, but I would argue that the majority of the humour is in the first half, while the second half gets a little more sentimental. These both worked in the movie, but the way the film begins gives absolutely no foreshadowing as to what the film will become by the end. I found that odd, but again, the cast sold all of the dialogue for me. From a few hilarious moments to some fun adventure/action throughout, as I said, I had a good time with this one.In the end, The Lost City is exactly what I think moviegoers need right now. Nothing too serious or weighed down by heavy drama. This is a good old-fashioned, silly comedy/romance that I feel works for what it is. It's not going to be the type of comedy that a lot of people are going to watch over and over again, at least I don't think, but the heart of the film is in the right place and it never takes anything too seriously. Now playing in theatres, I'd give a recommendation to The Lost City.","204 out of 300 found this helpful.

It perfectly fits into its categories of action, adventure, comedy, and romance.The story was very enjoyable. It started off kind of wonky and felt like I was in for a bad time, but once the ""prologue"" passed and the main portion of the movie started it got much better.The chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum worked surprisingly well, and only got better as the film progressed. I did enjoy Daniel Radcliffe as the antagonist. More of a bratty rich boy than an evil ""I want to murder everyone"" kind of bad guy.By the end I felt that the big part of the film was that the romance was definitely geared towards the women while the action parts were geared towards the men. The comedy could've gone either way, and some may find certain parts funnier than others, both scenes and what's actually funny.I also enjoyed the score. The way certain soundtracks were worked into the scenes noticeably helped enhance them (as soundtracks should).Overall, I think this film is perfect for a movie date night. It's funny, it's romantic, it has a pretty good action/adventure story and it's not as cheesy as most romcoms tend to be.I hope my review helps you make a choice on this film. Until next time....
Enjoy the show!","182 out of 274 found this helpful.

"","","An enjoyable knockoff of Indiana Jones et al. Romantic and goofy.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8007627/?ref_=tt_urv","JohnDeSando","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1391596/?ref_=tt_urv","26 March 2022","Yes, The Lost City is a sometime dimwitted, formulaic romantic adventure like Romancing the Stone and Indiana Jones with not much creativity that I could tell. No, it is not totally boring because it offers a relaxing antidote to COVID anxieties plaguing us for two years. The cutthroat island shenanigans, with reclusive romance novelist Loretta (Sandra Bullock) and her cover model Alan (Channing Tatum) are kidnapped looking for buried treasure.What makes this romance mildly enjoyable is the charm of its stars, Sandy/Loretta just a bit too old but looking fab, and Channing, buff and self-deprecating enough to generate a spark with Loretta. Daniel Radcliff as baddie Abagail Fairfax seems out of place, but then that may be the point.At our AMC-like theater there were a few other audience members far enough from us that we could cut up and converse, much like renting the theater for ourselves. Some solid scenes of repartee reminiscent of screwball comedies added to the pleasure of the island scenery and robust chases along with our not-always witty declamations.I would recommend you staying home and enjoying the house invasion Windfall on Netflix except that we enjoyed being out and seeing what Hollywood could do when it barely tries. And when Brad Pitt does a cameo with surprising dexterity, your retro romance Lost City is fully updated, and even semi-glamorous if you ask me. And you didn't.","62 out of 103 found this helpful.

Her manager Beth Hatten (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) is trying every wacky gimmick to save the declining series. Loretta has to do a book tour with idiot book cover model Alan (Channing Tatum). She gets kidnapped by Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) who is obsessed with finding an archaeological bejeweled artifact. Alan recruits former military mercenary Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt) to rescue Loretta from her volcano island captivity.This is a rather goofy screwball comedy. I wasn't sold on this movie at first. Tatum's idiot character is either not goofy enough or too goofy. I couldn't tell until the arrival of Brad Pitt. Pitt sets a great tone. His dead-pan performance cements this movie's ridiculousness. It's a matter of degrees. Nevertheless, Tatum has good chemistry with Bullock. There is some fun between these two stars. The leeches are memorable. He should have kept the Fabio hair. That would have upped his ridiculousness. I like the general tone and many of these actors. It could be better but it still has plenty of goofy fun.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

With movies like these it feels as though mainstream Hollywood is intentionally trying to dumb down the population or they have become so arrogant they think they can throw a few good actors together in a film that's made with 110% cheese! It's a cheese party and laughs and humor weren't invited! And the prized guests of the party were signs and facepalms whilst shaking ones head. Was this to make a quick buck? Maybe help out a fellow producer or writer who is a friend? Or maybe they just rely on the names to bring in the money, but I don't see how any of the stars in the film can actually watch this film and feel at all good about themselves and the product they've put out.

Well yes, The Lost City talks about a Reclusive author Loretta Sage (played by Sandra Bullock) who writes about exotic places in her popular adventure novels that feature a handsome cover model named Alan (played by Channing Tatum). While on tour promoting her new book with Alan, Loretta gets kidnapped by an eccentric billionaire (played by Daniel Radcliffe) who hopes she can lead him to an ancient city's lost treasure from her latest story. Determined to prove he can be a hero in real life and not just on the pages of her books, Alan sets off to rescue her.One of the most important aspects of any romance movie, is chemistry between the 2 lead actors. In The Lost City, this chemistry wasn't present. Sandra bullock returns to play one of her favourite characters that she always does a good job portraying and she did this time too, although the character was a bit shallow this time. Channing did a wonderful job, he was really funny and portrayed his character in the best way possible. Although we didn't see as much Daniel Radcliffe as I expected, he did a very good job portraying the villian that was a bit out of place in the movie having no big motive but jealousy from his brother. Brad Pitt's character was super amazing, cool, and funny, I would have loved to see him a bit more. Additionally, his cameo would have had a greater impact leaving a huge shock on the audience if it wasn't revealed in the trailer (although it is understandable that they did that for promotional reasons). Beth Hatten was a very funny character and added to the movie. However, I hated Allison and thought that her character was very useless.Overall, the movie was very fun and funny all throughout however, lacking an original story and having a weak script. So if your looking for a fun adventure rom-com, with no big expectations, this might be a good fit for you.Score:7/10.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The story was predictable but the cast was great. They balanced each other well, and the characters had more depth than one might think.

Daniel Radcliffe was brilliant as the villain but not as dumb as the premise makes him sound to be with a bad guy kid napping a romance novelist to find a treasure. There was real thought behind the character motivation, which I appreciated. And Channing Tatum as the wanna be hero came through.My review ends here.I'm not sure why this review needs 600 characters and is being flagged for being too short.

It's basically one of those movies you watch when you don't know what else to put on or wanna kill some time. At least that was my reason. Definitely not making any headlines or awards but has an A-list set of actors with a mediocre script that doesn't do them justice. We've all seen that one before right? I will say Brad Pitt was probably the best part of the whole movie and stole the show as he usually does in the little screen time he was given. The rest of the film was pretty much your average cookie cutter stuff you usually see in rom-coms, with a woke feminist take sprinkled in.

It has a good balance between making fun of cheesy romcoms and steamy romance novels while still being one at the end. The action and adventure theme pulled it all together creatively and made it much more entertaining than just a standalone love story with no other objectives.Didn't feel as forced or cause any eye rolling like traditional films of this genre for me, because of the bit of parody element they worked in. The parts that I generally find cringey were made intentionally awkward with the character dynamics and it just worked much better.Personally being in the entertainment field, it showed the dichotomy that a lot of people in the field go through. The character you're playing versus your true self. The more often or longer you play a character, you can sacrifice your own identity. Seeing this play out in a comical way between a writer and the cover models' real identities versus their on stage roles for interviews which were the polar opposites was a pretty accurate depiction of how working in the field can be and the expectations of always being ""on character"" with the fans expectations.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is amusing, and at times even funny, but not exactly groundbraking.A romance author played by Sandra Bullock ends up on an adventure in the jungle, and is followed by the model posing on her book covers (Channing Tatum).Truth to be told the script is shallow, and predictible, and the characters are as deep as a pizza box.But this movie doesn't pretend to be anything other than it is, and it more or less works, although it doesn't leave much behind.The show has some noticable appearances, like Daniel Radcliffe, and Brad Pitt who was very good. But the real star of the movie was Sandra Bullock, she just has the charm needed for these kind of movies - and she is quite good at physical comedy, and making the best out of mediocre script.If you want to turn of your brain for a moment and go for some harmless fun - this is the movie for you.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

"7","/10","The Action and Adventure Seem Lost In This Film For Me","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8003978/?ref_=tt_urv","rgkarim","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25226117/?ref_=tt_urv","25 March 2022","LIKES:The Pace Is Good:
Say what you want about the film, but I can't lie that the pace is much better than I anticipated this movie having. The Lost City has a lot of elements combined, but somehow balances a lot of the perspectives into a decently timed film that does not break the bank. A slower opening is curtailed by short time spending in it, but yet not enough to offset the important character building they are working on obtaining. It's quite a delight to be honest, and keeping that pace going works to keep some of the staler comedy tactics from being too hard to follow.The Character Involvement:
A movie loaded with casts like this are certainly something that gives me chills, primarily in how many times their characters are wasted in this movie. However, the movie surprises me again in how well it keeps using the characters that they introduce. While Tatum and Bullock do indeed have most of the screen time, Brad Pitt, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and Oscar Nuñez do get their fair share of inclusion in this movie to stay relevant to the plot and relationships of the character. Juggling all these characters without intruding too much is not an easy challenge, yet the comedy does well to really keep these pieces progressing down the same path.The Acting:
Surprisingly better than I anticipated, the movie brought out A game in comedy acting for much of the film despite the direction the film took. Radcliffe sort of reprises his role of the bratty villain again (see Now You See Me 2) , and he seems to be having fun with the role that he is trying to make come alive. He succeeds on many levels, and his level of hyperbolic comedy fits well into the movie's tone that fans will really enjoy the laughable character before them. Tatum is well Tatum on many levels of the movie, bringing that airheaded, naïve and street boy like demeanor that you either love or hate. His banter comedy and one-line delivery are on point in this film, and if you like the irony of a physically fit guy being very idiotic and incompetent on levels, then you are right at home in this film. To be fair though, he does also bring the vulnerable side out very well, and I give him props for finally bringing a more realistic and relatable character than what I have gotten from most of his other films. As for Bullock, the woman is on fire as she often is for me in her films. Combining the sarcasm of Miss Congeniality, the searching for life's moments from the Blind Side, and the attitude from Speed is how I can describe her character. Bullock manages to bring these sides together into a very good character, that helps convey the message of the movie, but never sacrifice the other elements that the film is attempting to achieve. A fantastic centerpiece to the character web, she's got a lot of fascinating levels that are realistic, and require the help of others to get through the impasses she faces in this film.The Message:
A comedy that is fun is a victory for many, and one that manages to add story to it gets even bigger props from me. However, when you can also put in some good moral assessing moments and make me feel for the character, that's a bonus in my book. The Lost City has once again managed to put a few lessons into the movie, and while some are indeed cheesy and very much thrown into your face, others are timed well to sort of break through the mirror. When I hit these moments, I really felt something for the characters, which again is smart writing when they learn how to time things right and not overdo them.The Music:
If you liked the theme song for the advertisements in this movie, then get ready to be blown away by soundtrack of this film. The Lost City is loaded with great songs that are utilized at the right times to set the mood, help bring out extra laughs and ambience of walking, while also just being fun to listen too. An A+ I grant to the selection of this soundtrack and even more for the sound utilization in the actual film.The Comedy
While the Lost City is far from being the cleverest, or even diverse style, it still does achieve the level of fun I look for in this type of movie. Sexual innuendos are loaded into this movie, both in your face and snuck in that sometimes had me belting out in the theater, and more so the other audience members, as the two leads battle for supremacy. However, there are plenty of other things to get you into the moment with this film including, but not limited to: slapstick humor involving bodily harm, one-liners that involve our characters being idiotic or enraged, rambling comedy where characters try to sound enlightened but are again just out there, and plenty of banter that is perhaps the cleverest device used. Regardless, you will find a log of laughs in this film if you give it a try, and I was very happy with what I got in this film if I'm being honest.DISLIKES:The Plot's Lack Of Adventure:
I can take off points for the high-level of predictability that is loaded into this movie, but what I think if fairer is that the adventure element is surprisingly limited to mostly what you see in the trailers. The Lost City's battling of dangerous criminals and the threats of the jungle has been laid out for you in those trailers, and while enjoyable there was so much more that could have been done. More animals they had to outwit, or more environmental hazards to use against the pursuing threats could have further amped up this movie's wow factor for me than what they did. This would be especially true in trying to solve the puzzle that got them into this mess, and finding more clues in the world to help beef up the mystery element.Radcliffe's Character:
While the former Harry Potter legend does the role well, it does not mean I enjoyed the villain any better. Fairfax is lame, a villain that is just a less polished version of the brat from Now You See Me 2, and I would have liked again either better comedy with him, or some element that made him a bigger threat than what we got. I get the point of the comedy is to integrate them into the mix, I really do, but the fact we could not integrate a better character into the mix that did not have to be an incompetent boob would have helped the adventure element of this plot they were striving to reach.Cheesy In Your Face Moments:
It's hard to avoid these moments in the style this comedy is presented in, but there are times where the cheese factor can be a little bit too much for a viewer like me. After seeing a few moments that feel raw, emotionally gut punching, and relatable to the point it hurts, to see the Hollywood rub it in your face moments are a little meh in my taste. Sure, they do bring the romantic comedy vibe with them, but they could have done a little better with that mess if they timed it better, or used it in a comedic moment rather. It's by far from the worst gospel moments I've seen, but it does still exist at times.The Random Interruption of Pace:
The movie does well keeping that fun and fast pace moment to really keep us moving towards the goal of survival, but then hits this random moment that sort of trips the entire element. About three-quarters through the movie, we randomly drop into this one moment that completely drops the mood into an off-kilter moment belonging in a Sparks' novel movie, that while heartwarming and emotional, feels out of place amidst the rest of the movie. It's not that there were not enjoyable moments to it, but it's the scene that feels shoved in the most compared to the other elements I saw earlier in the film.Needed More Time:
Ironically, this movie could have used a little more time to make the adventure feel the most worthwhile. That descent in the jungle, the pursuit of the bad guys, and the integration of the other characters all needed some more time and scenes to really hit the full bang this film wanted. While this may of course burn more minutes from your plans, the Lost City could have used a little more coordination to really give us the comedic adventure the trailers wanted, and help not feel like those romance moments were shoehorned in for the sake of wrapping up the film.The VERDICT:
The Lost City turned out to be a surprise for me, because of how much fun I had in this fast-paced adventure/comedy that was very open to most audiences. A story that is not ridiculously stupid, it balances both serious and funny moments in a decent see-saw of moments that help you really grab on to the characters and engage in their life. Yet, for those looking for simplistic fun, the movie has that for you too, and the writing alongside sequences is sure to just be enjoyable for groups to see. Alongside beautiful shots, variety of comedic moments, and a soundtrack that kicks butt, you really do have a movie that checks the boxes for what going to the movies used to be about investing in the time. As for the dislikes, the movie really just needed more time and planning for the adventure element, to really deliver the potential of these two unlikely explorers having a fun decipher of the riddle. More time, alongside a more serious villain could have done wonders for this movie, perhaps helping dilute the shoehorned moments, allow for more comedy that was not innuendo based, and not interrupting the momentum of the movie that happens near the end. Still, the movie is definitely fun, and brings a balanced picture that does not break the dam of cursing or R rated moments many films like to get away with. As such, my recommendation is to catch this movie in theaters if you can, preferably with a group, as I give The Lost City a score of:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0-6.5.","12 out of 23 found this helpful.

Though he still will not accept bad dancing - but that is a different story. Harry Radcliffe ...

It's super fun! I went without expectations, and ended up being very surprised!The biggest hit of this movie is in the performances! The main couple (Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum) are sensational, each one in their own moment of the character, but with a very well developed chemistry, around small ""dramatic"" lines and a lot of unusual situations, thus generating the comedy. Daniel Radcliffe and Brad Pitt are super good. Emphasizing here that Brad P.'s participation is small, but it's too sensational.But obviously not just flowers! The film has some problems, I think most of them coming from the script. The progress of the story doesn't seem very natural, it's as if to follow the adventurous story booklet, the text forced some situations so that you can get where you want. Another point is the villain, extremely cartoonish, without many layers, he's just there to get in the way.In short, it's a fun movie! Anyone who enjoys adventure, comedy and even a hint of romance will definitely enjoy it! Those who don't like it, like me, might be surprised, if you give it the chance and go with an open mind. Fun, uncompromising, no loose ends, well rounded, with a few slips, but that don't compromise the experience as a whole.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Brad's Pitt and Daniel Radcliffe were awesome in this. Pitt nailed all his comedic timing and Radcliffe has great range and played the villain role really well. So much that one day he should play a Bond villain. Looked like he was having a lot of fun with this. No post credit but there is a great mid credit scene that adds to the story. Solid movie!","45 out of 76 found this helpful.

Not sure what Sandra Bullock was thinking when she made this. Maybe she just wanted something light rather than the heavy drama she'd been doing. The script just seems to strive too hard for witty one liners and comebacks. It may have been better with someone less accomplished than Bullock, since we expect more from her.Channing Tatum was amusing and certainly nice to look at in his bare-it-all scenes. Daniel Radcliffe was funny, but at times seemed to be acting in a different movie. Storyline is preposterous and all over the place with many elements that make no sense whatsoever.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

And a goat. Oh, and some leeches. Sandra Bullock plays Sandra Bullock Doing Another Rom-com. Channing Tatum plays a great big bag of muscles that can talk. Brad Pitt thankfully shows up (for a very short time) and steals the show with the only real laughs. Well, him and the goat. And Daniel Radcliffe is in it too. If anybody cares. I don't. Most of the jokes in the film fall flat and just lay there. Like a dead fish. The whole thing feels kinda lazy. Like they just stole a bunch of stuff from other movies, threw 'em together and hoped for the best. I guess there are worse ways to spend 2 hours. Like having a B-list actress pull leeches off my behind. (Very awkward, unfunny scene. One of many.) Anyway, go and see it if you want.

In fact she thought it was a waste of her time.So tonight I watched it (alone) at home on Amazon streaming and found it to be a totally entertaining movie. It doesn't take itself very seriously at all, and the final scene with Bullock, Pitt, and Tatum in a yoga class, punctuated that sentiment.The movie is mostly a parody of such movies as ""Raiders"", in fact the opening scene where there are lots and lots of snakes all over is one parody, they ask ""Where did all these snakes come from? Who feeds them?"" The thoughts I had when watching that scene in ""Raiders"" in the giant tomb with all the snakes. I also found it to have elements of ""Romancing the Stone"" because Bullock plays a romance novelist and Tatum is her cover model. They end up lost in the jungle (filmed in the Dominican Republic).So in this movie a wealthy treasure hunter (Radcliffe) searches for a mythical treasure on a volcanic island, he needs someone to translate a portion of ancient markings, hoping to provide a clue. When she doesn't go voluntarily she is kidnapped. So most of the movie involves action on the island where they try to escape.Anyone who goes into viewing this and expecting a serious drama will certainly be disappointed. Viewed for its comedy absurdity, it is nicely entertaining.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The storyline was just nice, nothing innovative (it followed the same concept every adventure-comedy movie does). The characters were very interesting, well-developed, so likeable and really funny. The filming location of the movie was really good, a small tropical island. In my opinion, the most boring part of the film was, the first 20 minutes. Especially, the opening scene wasn't very well executed. Of course, it was a funny movie that had many jokes. Also, it was a very intense movie, full of action filled scenes and they were very well portrayed. It wasn't an unexpected movie, I mean there weren't any plot twists and the ending was expected. Moreover, the casting was really good and the acting was nice, as always. Last but not least, the post credits scenes was really weird and kinda complicated. Anyway, I don't think they're gonna make a sequel, even though it was a nice movie.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

While some moments of expected peril still persist, the film as a whole goes out of its way to assume a more subdued approach that fits with the characters and narrative.The plot overall is concise and imaginative, though the climactic moments could have been stronger had a more serious outlook been utilized: an example of this would be the direction that was taken for the main antagonist. While their repercussions are negligible and vague, a more fitting demise that could have stemmed from their blind arrogance and drive for notoriety would have been more memorable.The humor throughout the film acts as a good counterweight for the somber tones introduced off and on in the main character's arch, and it lands decently overall. Minus a few gratuitous moments that could have been cut, most of the comedic output meshes well with the action and storyline.One point of dissonance that unfortunately cropped up several times involved the poor build up and execution of moments dealing with the fate of a reoccurring side character. Twice, when two different supporting characters seemingly met their end, the story presented the scenes so abruptly that they felt jarring in contrast to what came before and after - A few wisecracks one moment and a visceral gunshot immediately after - While both of these scenes could have stood out positively and led to satisfying conclusions, they ultimately felt bizarly rushed.In summery, ""The Lost City"" mostly achieves what it sets out to accomplish. It's a lighthearted adventure that stumbles at times, but holds its viewer's focus through clever plot, fun characters, and a heartwarming through-line of timeless love. While not the shiniest of cinematic gems, it remains a solid experience for anyone looking for a new adventure.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Sandra is an ok actress but as a worldwide bestselling author why would she ever appear in a jumpsuit in any capacity??? And Channing Tatum while handsome is about as charismatic as a bag of potatoes. Cameos never really help the plot along and this insipid movie needed all the help it could get. Douglas and Turner had the movie down cold about 30 years ago so I shut this one off and watched the original instead.","35 out of 62 found this helpful.

While it doesn't quite reach the heights of its genre's best, it delivers an entertaining and inoffensive cinematic experience.The film follows Loretta Sage, a reclusive romance novelist who is kidnapped by a billionaire seeking the help of her fictional hero to locate a lost treasure. Rescued by the rugged cover model of her books, Alan, Loretta and Alan embark on a perilous journey through the jungle, encountering various dangers and uncovering personal truths along the way.The film's strengths lie in its undeniable chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum. Bullock brings her signature wit and charm to the role of Loretta, while Tatum delivers a surprisingly endearing performance as Alan, embodying both his character's bravado and hidden vulnerabilities. Their banter is witty and engaging, and their dynamic adds a delightful layer of humor to the story.However, the narrative itself is fairly predictable, following a well-worn formula of mistaken identities, romantic entanglements, and treasure hunts. While there are a few surprising twists along the way, the general trajectory of the story is quite predictable.The action sequences are also somewhat underwhelming, lacking the thrill and intensity of other films in the genre. The jungle setting provides some exotic visuals, but the action itself is often uninspired and lacks the suspense that would elevate the film to a higher level.Despite its shortcomings, The Lost City is an enjoyable diversion, offering a lighthearted escape from reality with its charming performances, witty dialogue, and adventurous plot. It's not a film that will leave you thinking long after the credits roll, but it's worth a watch for those seeking a fun and entertaining cinematic experience.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

From poster, I got impression that this is cheap clone of Uncharted, but it turned out to be lighthearted adventure romance comedy.From the beginning It makes clear it never takes itself seriously, and thanks to due good cast and writing entertains till end.Romance part is in my opinion weakest element of the movie, at least I was not entirely sold by chemistry of the lead actors.Adventure part was really well made, with beautiful locations, and some great and funny action scenes.I did not notice any CGI effects and which was refreshing for me. It has the fell like old adventure movies, that could have being made decades ago.Maybe this could be also reason for some negative reviews - this is not Indy or Uncharted, nor superhero movie packed with action spectacle.It has more than a few similarities to Romancing the Stone, which is a good thing, event though it may not match its qualities.Some says the script was not original. While I would agree plot wise, I also think the writers created original characters, and there are some great comic moments, that were fresh and well executed.When the movie ended, I felt lighter, smiling, and compelled to write review. While there may be something missing to achieve greatness, this is still solid entertainment, worth watching when in mood for something to relax with.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Action scenes are passable but nothing that truly sticks in the memory. The big gripe i have with the film is at times the humour is just too silly, borderline annoying.

And what you get is a studio product, the very definition of mediocrity. Despite ripping off the premise from the infinitely superior Romancing The Stone the writing is atrociously unfunny and the direction completely by-the-numbers. As if the director was telling everyone he needed so many shots that day so let's get on and get through the pain of it as efficiently as possible.I realise Sandra Bullock has had a lot of work done on her face, which is now permanently dour, but she looks embarrassed and bored in almost every scene. Even being carried away from an explosion her lifeless facial muscles are completely expressionless and she is discernibly counting down in her head to the detonation. Channing Tatum has difficulty even just playing himself and is he's clearly bored too, as indeed is Brad Pitt in his cameo, evidently thankful for the brevity of his role (taken as a reciprocal favour to Bullock for her cameo in his movie, Bullet Train). None of them manage to wring any excitement or life out of the terrible script and dialogue and the adventure itself is so utterly boring that not even the lazy vista shots can help.The people who like this movie are clearly an undemanding generation, who have probably never seen more skilfully crafted examples within this genre such as the aforementioned Romancing The Stone.Anyway, do yourself a favour and avoid this one. It's genuinely awful and you can easily tell that even the cast thought so too. They certainly don't need this kind of rubbish so why they signed up for this drivel is anyone's guess.","12 out of 18 found this helpful.

She is taken to an island where her archaeological skills are needed to find a treasure hidden in a lost tomb. Sage's cover model Alan (Channing Tatum), mercenary Jack (Brad Pitt), and Sage's publisher Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) try to come to Loretta's aid.This riff on ""Romancing the Stone"" and a few other Hollywood projects about writers shouldn't work this well. The screenplay credit is messy, but Bullock uses her impeccable comic timing to deliver. Tatum brings more to the ""dumb guy"" role than was required, Pitt should have had more fun with his pretty boy/mercenary role, and Radcliffe doesn't get lost in the shuffle. Patti Harrison, as Sage's social media ambassador, steals her scenes from the name performers. Randolph is good, but like Pitt, I wanted more from her character. The Nee brothers' direction is heavy on technology. The color correction and lighting are harsh, and some of the special effects aren't convincing. The pacing has more fits and starts than my first used car, so when a running gag or set-piece lands, it's more successful than it should have been. Alan has a great scene with Loretta after she refers to her romance fiction as shlock, and he sets her straight about disrespecting the audience who loves her stories. I wish a few hundred Hollywood types, some of whom are in this film, would watch that scene, and then watch the scene again.Contains physical violence, gun violence, gore, profanity, male nudity, some sexual references, adult situations, alcohol and tobacco use.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is not surprising that production wise, this was never going to be a spectacular recreation of an actual lost city. Yes some nice tropical island locations and effective CGI where required, nothing breathtaking. But its effective, with enough eye candy to satisfy.The strength of this movie is something that a lot (if not most) of the $200 million plus movies lack, which is Heart. The actors give of their best performances, they know this is a cheesy, rom com adventure, but its never overplayed as such, being just the right amount of self aware that lets the audience partake in the experience along with the actors, without ever being condescending. This makes it possible to forgive the inevitable plot holes, and contrivances, that pop up.Its a funny, warm, if occasionally violent mix. An extra $40m spent on developing the plot, creating an actual lost city, and maybe some throwback scenes to the actual lost city story, would have fleshed this out to real Saturday night blockbuster level.

Considering they are film stars from the same era I found that quite surprising, and found myself wishing they'd work together again.The Pitt and Bullock chemistry actually kind of takes away the chemistry from Tatum and Bullock, thought I have to say they do have chemistry also, just not as much as she does with Pitt. Some parts of the film also just were not really that funny, and I could have done without them.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was saving best for last: Channing Tatum steals the show here, not taking himself seriously and clumsily fooling around, this is one of his best performances. His ""entrance"" on stage at the beginning of the film is absolutely hilarious and he plays it with great second-degree humor.The film is well made (flow of the story, scenery, action sequences, comic scenes) and is well worth the evening.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Love her (most anyway!)movies for what they are: fun escapism.When I saw the trailer 4 this pic, I thought straight away of RTS (1984) but the vibe seemed more comedic.I started watching it last night and didn't expect to laugh as quickly as I did.Definetly a great turn from the main cast.Though on its own Tatum's performance is up to par and self mockingly funny, I think he was miscast against Bullock.I agree with others that the chemistry between them was a bit lacking. Maybe bcs of the age difference, the romance would have been better done with an older lead against SB.I mean, they do poke fun/don't try to hide her age, so an older, maybe a bit out of shape (wanting to recapture his youth) male lead would have enhanced the comedic parts and allowed for a more, I believe Hollywood likes to refer to it as 'organic' romance. This would have also helped the contrast with the Brad Pitt (perfect specimen) alternative love interest.A quick shout out to Radcliffe as well as he camps up his baddie just enough, whilst keeping him believable as a whiny spoilt rich manchild.Last but not least, yes I enjoyed SB performance.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

In terms of romance novels, pfft even less so (the few I've read I've done so as comedies through and through). However, I am a big Sandra Bullock fan, have been for ages, and couldn't pass up the opportunity to see my girl back up on the big screen where she belongs. Yes, I've enjoyed seeing her tear it up the last few years in various streaming endeavors (personally I don't buy into her whole Netflix is the only reason she still has a career thing) but.. anywho, Bullock + Big Screen = 4evr for me!Moving on.In The Lost City (2022) Bullock plays a reclusive, broken-hearted romance novelist that gets kidnaped during a book tour and swept up in a jungle adventure with her cover model Channing Tatum. TLC is part Raiders of the Lost Ark, Romancing the Stone, and Baywatch to name a few all mixed together with an over-the-top sense of self-awareness and a banging soundtrack. Yep, there will be seat dancing.In short, The Lost City is good stupid fun.While not as hilarious as The Proposal or endearing as While You Were Sleeping, The Lost City is funny, sweet, and charming in its own right. I snickered, giggled, and laughed-out-loud start to finish. Thoroughly enjoyed the characters, Tatum's plays the clueless but loveable idiot brilliantly. Daniel Radcliffe's unhinged, billionaire baddie is pure over-the-top fun. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's put upon, stressed out, BFF delights. And then there's Brad Pitt's Jack Trainer. OMG, I can't even with this one. The proverbial cherry on top is of course Bullock's doing what she does best. That special blend of sweetness, awkwardness, sarcasm, charm, and je ne sais quoi, *chef's kiss*.The Lost City is a solid, throwback rom-com, action adventure that's comforting and nostalgic in its familiarity, has enough twists and surprises to keep it fresh and engaging, and offers up an entertaining movie experience. Be it at the theater now or watching at home later, The Lost City is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours.As always, your heads up not to bolt at the start of the credits, there's a bonus scene that's sure to bring a smile to your face and tops off the film wonderfully.The Lost City is a 7.5.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The humorous beats are diverse and fast-paced, and I was never bored, despite rolling my eyes occasionally.For the most part, The Lost City is an adventure romp that knows exactly what it is, and is completely okay being just that. And for that reason, I'm completely okay with it too.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

But I went to go with my family, and I have to say that the movie was actually more enjoyable than I had initially anticipated.The storyline in ""The Lost City"", as written by Oren Uziel, Dana Fox, Adam Nee and Seth Gordon, actually turned out to be a well-written one, and it was a storyline that had lots of different elements to it. ""The Lost City"" is a good combination of adventure, action and comedy, and it was done in such a way that it was actually rather enjoyable.Now, I mentioned that this is not something I would normally spend a cinema admission on earlier, and that is because I am by no means a fan of Channing Tatum, and while Sandra Bullock does have a handful of good movies to her name then she is not cinema-worthy for me.Directors Aaron Nee and Adam Nee managed to put together a good and fun adventure movie. I liked the ways that the comedy elements were laced into the storyline, and there was also a good amount of nicely choreographed action.While Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum are not my first pick of go-to performers, then I will say that they were nicely cast for the movie and they definitely put on good performances on the screen. So thumbs up for the casting. But I have to say that it was Daniel Radcliffe and Brad Pitt that made my day in the movie, they were just brilliant in ""The Lost City"".""The Lost City"" makes for a good popcorn movie, where you just lean back in the seat, enjoy the snacks and watch the movie for what it is. If you like light-hearted adventure movies, then it is definitely worth a watch. However, I doubt that this is a movie I will ever return a second time.My rating of ""The Lost City"" lands on a six out of ten stars.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

I have evaluated this 3 times now and all 3 times were very positive reviews.I am not a fan of American comedies, but this one was a pleasant surprise. What I like about this movie is that it is witty and a lot of the short minor jokes were creative and unexpected. Many of the jokes are not direct, but uses insinuation and and implication, which is really just genius in my opinionThe overall plot is formulaic, but that is expected in comedy especially when they're often parodies. However, my only issue with this film is the editing which bloated the run time. I think it could be trimmed cleaner by cutting a lot of the slow talking parts which don't really add anything to be plot other than trying to build the relationship between the two protagonists.Overall, a good 7/10.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Daniel Radcliff from Harry Potter gets to play bad guy. Tatum's character at the beginning is almost offensively and perhaps unintentionally two-dimensional and off-putting. This romance, comedy, adventure movie though adds two nice elements to the genre. First, there is an increasing element of seriousness and a touching measure of maturation or at least revelation of the humanizing of Tatum's character and an added depth for the typical relational component of romance in this movie. Second, the anticlimax of the movie is somehow more refreshing and connective to today's audience that has been bombarded with the more outrageous. Whether the inclusion of the final scene that comes after the major ending credits was tacked on by the producers to allow for a better audience focus-group reaction is at present unknown. Overall, this rom-com is a nice contribution to the genre.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

It fits the bill as a good date movie as well.Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) is a successful romance writer whose best days are behind her. Following her husband's death, she's been in a five year funk and she has become, essentially, a hermit. However, her newest book is about to debut and her publicist wants her to attend a readers' convention...and she unexpectedly gets sucked into a plot by an evil man (Daniel Radcliff). He kidnaps her and two men (Brad Pitt and Channing Tatum) come to her rescue. What's next? See the film.The film is fun...period. It's enjoyable and undemanding. My only complaints are that the big finale seems to happen too easily and Brad Pitt's character's final scene didn't make any sense at all. Still, it's engaging and worth seeing.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I think it would be lost on television as it's an old fashioned cinema comedy adventure movie in the tradition going right back to The Keystone Cops or Jungle Jim and Tarzan era.It's unpretentious well produced , yes at times silly but I'd rather see ten films like The Lost City than one like a certain pretentious Viking box office disaster that's screening at the moment .The plot is simple with similarities to Romancing the Stone (1984) but it's not a remake in my opinion as there's enough difference's in the plot to make it stand on its own. We do have a jaded disillusioned romance novelist Loretta Sage /Angela played by Sandra Bulloch who through dramatic circumstances after her latest book launch organised by her literary agent Beth Hadden in a fun performance from Da'Vine Joy Randolph.Loretta is kidnapped by Abigail Fairfax an eccentric bratty billionaire (Daniel Ratcliffe) who explains his name as gender neutral while trying to get Loretta to reveal the whereabouts of the
""Crown of Fire"", a priceless treasure.Loretta's handsome cover model Alan or Dash played by Channing Tatum as his book fans know him sees the kidnapping and pursues her captors aided by rugged ex combat fighter Jack Trainer(Brad Pitt).Dash or Allan appears all brawn and no brain but has a heart of gold and Loretta who at first is indifferent to him soon warms to his clunky buffness.That's enough plot line from me the movie was filmed in the Dominican Republic and only wrapped up on October 2021 principle photography began in March 2021 and there is talk of a sequel already.The Lost City is proof that a relatively modest budget of $64-74million dollars can do well at the Box Office as it's already earned Worldwide $130.6 million.Don't expect the techno brilliance of Dune or Star Wars but if you like an uncomplicated unpretentious adventure escape with some really good performances especially from Channing Tatum Sandra Bulloch and Daniel Ratcliffe as the villain of the piece I recommend The Lost City.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

There's nothing amazing this movie is trying to do, it knows what it is. It's here to make you laugh and excite here and there and it does its job. I didn't find it THAT funny personally, but where there was a lack in comedy (for me) it made up for with a lot of heart. It's genuinely a fun story, and it's very entertaining to watch these actors bounce off each other the way they do. Sandra and Channing have great on-screen chemistry and Daniel Radcliffe was clearly having fun in the role of a villain. On a side note, I really appreciate that the majority of this film seemed to be shot on location in an actual jungle. I just really enjoy it when they make that kind of effort instead of a ""green screen"". You can tell Sandra is really there and it adds so much more life to everything. I think there were a few ""green screen"" shots that were probably reshooting through production, but 90% of this movie is shot in a Dominican Republic jungle, and that's awesome.If you need something light-hearted go check it out this weekend. I will admit there's nothing The Lost City does that we haven't already seen in a comedy. But you know what, the performances by all the actors and the clear intention to have fun with the concepts make this a pretty entertaining watch.

The best thing that this movie did as others had mentioned, is highlight how hard it is to be an actor and make me see Brad Pitt in a different light. I feel he is a bit one-note too. But he shines in this movie. There is something about him that made me want to watch him. He was funny. He made the character interesting.

Her editor's wig is also silly and so obvious. Perhaps I'm being petty, but this all detracted from an already weak plot and movie, which could have and should have been entertaining.

I found the acting weak, especially from Tatum. I didn't warm to his character, despite his heroics. In all I found it a very bland, forgettable film.Daniel Radcliffe played a major part of the story but he wasn't on screen that much. Perhaps that was part of the problem - we're too used to seeing him in the lead role. Sandra Bullock came across as a stronger character and I wish I could walk in her ""mountain trekking"" boots!The dialogue was hard to follow at times and I didn't understand some of it. I wouldn't recommend it to adults but perhaps young teenagers may like this film as it has a bit of slapstick action, mild violence and some mild peril.Not to disrespect the actors as they've all previously played great roles but I won't recommend this film or will watch it again.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Just strolling around and giving this movie a shot. Action-adventure comedy movie like this is really great to lit our weekend consumption needs - laughter from comedy. Some huge casts are shown up like Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum, Daniel Radcliffe, and Brad Pitt. The movie plot is simple to find the lost city through an unexpected adventurous journey.The pros are this movie felt entertaining enough through jokes, clear external and internal Hollywood references - citing the movie and using OST music - and actor performances. Practical jokes and rom-com movies typically seem great. Movie narration and jokes seem at a suitable pace. Hollywood references make this movie relatable to the audience. Sorry, I'm not trying to spoil the reference because please just see it lol. Lastly, actor performances are absolutely no doubt caused they are great casts. Visual quality? Just good or Hollywood standards. The cons are the movie plot is too simple and the char's background is too shallow. But actually, these two cons are typical of comedy movies.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The comedy and romance are understated, perhaps too much, and the violence is not to be taken seriously. This is just a couple of great actors having fun for our enjoyment.I'd happily see this again at home in preference to anything showing at my local mega-theater. We are awash in imperfect movies this year, so this movie stands taller than it might in a more shining era, but a benefit of the deluge is that there are some good movies, such as this one, even in underrepresented niches such as romantic comedy.

I feel like we've been getting quite a few ""treasure hunt"" movies lately, and while it was better than Uncharted, it definitely wasn't a Raiders of the Lost Ark. It played its romance cards well, and while some scenes felt a little embarrassing to watch, none were unbearable. I never thought I'd see Sandra Bullock play a character like Loretta Sage, but she managed to a really good job. Same with Channing Tatum as Dash. Bradd Pitt, Daniel Radcliffe, and Oscar Nunez were all fun additions, and I loved how they fit this movie so well. The comedy was very much a hit or miss, with some of it being very dull and hard to laugh at, while other bits were hilarious. I found it really weird that some jokes were reused or had another shot taken at them, but it was good nonetheless. The adventure itself is fun, but felt a little long. But in a way that lets the scenes sink in a little better. I'd say all in all, this movie is definitely one I wouldn't mind watching again.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

You couldn't watch television or go on the internet without seeing an advertisement for this film. Then all of a sudden, it was gone. I didn't hear anything about it. It was like the film straight-up disappeared. It didn't seem like something I would pay to see in theaters, so It just slipped through the cracks. Then while going back through films released this year, I realized I never ended up watching this film. So I dusted off the ole pen and pencil and went to work.The Lost City's strength is the all-star cast and the chemistry of its lead roles. The highlight of this movie is the performance of Daniel Radcliffe. Radcliffe plays the film's villain in another performance that makes him one of my favorite actors of the past twenty years. For the small amount of screen time, Brad Pitt makes the most of it. He is easily one of the funniest parts of this movie, and it would be a much lower-rated film without him. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum are also great as the lead characters. The chemistry their characters build throughout the film makes the film's second half bearable. What the film lacks is consistency. The first half caught my attention, and I was fully invested. By the second half, much of my attention had been lost due to a slow script. It makes me upset I was bored by the second half because when Daniel Radcliffe reenters the film, I really wanted to be excited for him, but I just couldn't.7/10 A harmless, fun action-comedy that's missing something to make it great.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Rest assured, The Lost City (of D) is a lot of fun and is honestly better than it should be.The story does like milking the plot structure from '80s classic adventure movies like Romancing the Stone or Indiana Jones. It follows frustrated romance novelist Loretta Sage (Bullock) and her dim cover model Alan (Tatum) after she's kidnapped by a weird billionaire (Radcliffe) who's looking for a lost treasure. And he thinks Loretta Sage knows how to locate it. The lovelorn Alan follows after them to rescue Loretta with the help of a cool-as-hell specialist (Brad Pitt) who is not onscreen very long.The movie sounds tiresome on paper and I'll be honest, the first ten or fifteen minutes are both rushed and thinly written. I was worried if this was going to be the whole movie. But luckily once Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum are onscreen together trying to survive and fall in love, it is quite a lot of fun.Once the adventure begins, it really picks up and the jokes are really funny. Despite being 57, Sandra Bullock remains a gorgeous woman and her comic timing is as good as ever. Channing Tatum has mastered playing the 'dumb but sweet manchild' to a tee now. I saw more of Tatum' ass than I ever wanted to see though. They had surprisingly good chemistry.The show is nearly stolen by Daniel Radcliffe who is having an absolute blast as the bad guy Abigail Fairfax (yes really). He really yucks it up as a wacky rich lunatic and has some great lines. Brad Pitt really just has a cameo appearance in turns of screen-time without going into spoilers. But he is so cool and funny at the same time.A couple of the side characters are kind of wasted unfortunately. There is a sidestory about Loretta Sage's assistant (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) who is also on a rescue mission and it is jarring whenever it cuts back from the main story to her. Randolph's demeanor and delivery could make some lines funny but they don't give her that many good jokes and that's a shame. A second character who is basically a grown woman acting like a teenager is very annoying but she's not onscreen long thank god.On the flip slide, Oscar Nunez (from The Office) is in this and he is pretty damn funny. It's a one-joke stereotypical kind of character but man he is hilarious and did everything right.There is not quite as much action in this as say Jungle Cruise or the more recent Jumanji movies. But it's clever how they handle the fight scenes and chases.Despite its generic sounding title, The Lost City is a good time.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There was so much scientific information, as the story of the books was actually real and that is where they lost the audience because there wasn't that much information about this Island. We were only given the information bits and peace's along the way so we can piece it together later on. The cover model should have stayed as a cover model, Like Chris Farley (Tommy Boy) Wishing to be something more than he is couldn't be possible, and only accepting the fact that he is a cover model would have been funnier and acceptable. Instead, they made the scenes very complicated and redundant over his character being something more than a Cover model and more like he has a soul, Then here comes the back story, storytelling which was ""BORING"".

Absurd, insulting and not funny -that scene for sure, but could apply to most of the film as well.Bad Rip Off? Romancing the Stone of course. This film is the manifestation of so much that is wrong with the movie business these days. Bullock is cute, but in trying to look 35 when she is 55 sort of works, but sort of doesn't. The DIE (Diversity, Inclusion, Equity) casting is painfully obvious and does not do anyone any favours. Black? Check. Asian? Check. Gay? Check. Obese? Check. Yawn... I pay for entertainment, not social justice agendas.A few good lines, a few good scenes, that sadly stand out as good against a tapestry of boring, plagiarized, trying too hard and failing miserably.Pitt is classic, but his role and character are insultingly betrayed by the credits scene. Radcliffe is a moustache twirling bad guy who is suitably overplayed. For the rest, give it a big miss.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

The movie basically revolves around Channing Tatum's hilarious reaction to every peril and danger. Sandra Bullock charms as always, and Daniel Radcliffe's kooky villain entertains but the best part of the film is Brad Pitt's over-the-top hero. His character is a gut-busting foil to Tatum's attempts to impress Sandra Bullock. The Lost City has plenty of funny moments and laughs but feels overly familiar like I have seen it all in other movies. I enjoyed The Lost City and recommend it, but I wish it did more to feel unique than rely on Tatum's wacky antics and Pitt's uproarious cameo.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This was dumb and not very original.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

Guess she was in need of a break to recharge and reenergize herself. Channing Tatum is perfect and seems tireless, any role he's in he puts that extra thrust that never disappoints and so far everything I've seen him in I wasn't disappointed. Brad Pitt on the other hand literally stole the movie with the little screen time he had, I'm not big on him but he was magnificent in this movie. Daniel Radcliffe who plays a billionaire is the villain and again he trying to put those ""Harry Potter"" movie's behind him, again I say he just needs the right script unfortunately this isn't one of them. As a whole this one doesn't in my opinion deliver but offers just enough to get by.It's not a remake of ""Romancing The Stone"" but does borrow heavily from it as it tries to offer a bit more than RTS does. The chemistry may have been stronger had Bullock been more refreshed but she made several movies back to back and was pretty much burned out and sadly it showed. The gimmicks and stunt's aren't are that great nor are some of the jokes and seemed to take a bit to get moving. The action is there but the acting wasn't to me up to par. Glad I waited to purchase this as I'll wait a bit till the hype wears off and try again.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Their on-screen chemistry is fabulous and they are both great at comedy. Daniel Radcliffe is good as the big bad. Brad Pitt has a scene stealing extended cameo. Though the casting is spot-on and the locales are exotic (similar to other adventure films -> an island off the coast); the film is quite derivative (with Pitt's character being the only surprise).The Lost City is good fun despite it's faults.

And it was!In the movie Sandra Bullock is a romance novelist mourning the loss of her husband and Channing Tatum is a guy who's become famous as the cover model for her books. After she is kidnapped by the cheerful psychopath Daniel Radcliffe she finds herself searching for treasure on a mysterious Island while Tatum tries to rescue her with the hilarious assistance of an ultimate alpha male Brad Pitt.Things go wrong and there's a lot of running around.Pitt, Radcliffe, and Tatum are all excellent but Sandra Bullock shockingly doesn't seem to quite manage the character. She does a good job as a depressed rather angry woman but seems unable to transition into the predictable romantic part. It feels as though she believed, like a lot of us, that she could act a comedy romance in her sleep, decided to try it, and found she couldn't after all.Still, while not perfect this is tremendous fun and I recommend it if you like light adventure comedies. I almost gave this an 8 and probably would have Bullock had been up to snuff.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I cannot blame any of the actors for the mediocre plot, just the first act was promising so much more.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I love Sandra Bullock as an actress. I have seen most of her movies. She usually makes me laugh, I love the romcoms. But this movie, which received so much hype, has to be her worst movie ever. I thought ""The Heat"" was bad, but this goes way beyond bad. Sandra, you cannot be that desperate for a paycheck. Channing Tatum, I don't know why he was picked, I didn't feel that they had any chemistry together. Brad Pitt's character would have made the movie more interesting, but I guess they couldn't afford his salary. Anyway you look at it, this will be the worst 90 minutes you will waste in your life.

A romance novelist lost in the jungle with her cover model. For the most part the film is able to take full advantage of this set up. Tatum and Bullock do a great job, as well as Daniel Radcliffe as the villain. The supporting cast as well get some good time to shine, including a hilarious bit with the character of ""Jack Trainer"".The two leads, Bullock and Tatum have a good back and forth throughout the film. Their lines have good comedic timing, and come across very natural. Sometimes their comedic banter does not land as well as the director may have thought. Certain sequences seem to last too long, as if the two actors improved a bunch of quips and the editor couldn't decide which ones to cut out.The film does have its fair share of logical inconsistencies in the duo's escape. Certain plot points that leave the audience saying, ""there is no way that should have worked."" but we go along with it anyways. The movie does keep cutting back to a ""B-Plot"" that isn't nearly as funny or engaging as the main story. But it feels that the movie spends a lot of time here as homework they have to do for the finale. There is also a romantic subplot in the story that I was just not buying. That combined with some lazy story telling clichés towards the third act, hold this movie back from being great.But all in all, I still had a good time. The jokes that landed out numbered the stretches of misfires. And the lame story beats are salvaged by the likable cast of characters. There may be some detours along the way, but I think there is treasure to be found in ""The Lost City"".","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This romantic comedy adventure follows a reclusive writer and an underestimated cover model as they get embroiled in a billionaire's plot to unearth a lost treasure. It's a breezy, fast-paced romp that plays with the same sort of chalk and cheese dynamic that has acted as the genre's bread and butter almost since its inception. Bullock and Tatum are charming in their familiar yet entertaining lead roles, while Radcliffe's villainous forehead vein outacts almost everyone else on screen. There are a handful of chuckles and even some disarming action sequences, too. Generally, it does exactly what you expect it to, but does most of it rather well; it's as generic as it is enjoyable. It's a solid, if somewhat forgettable, experience that should keep you in high spirits for its modest duration.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But the lush setting only takes it so far. While Bullock's portrayal of glass half-empty novelist Loretta Sage is in line with where she usually excels, and Tatum's portrayal of dumb as rocks cover model Alan is not a stretch given his filmography, the two together do not light up the screen. Sure, some of the moments here are worthy of a few chuckles, but they are easily outnumbered by the many unfunny one-liners or pop culture references that just don't land.When considering the supporting cast, aside from a semi-hilarious Brad Pitt, there's not much to write home about. Daniel Radcliffe comes across as a mouse trying to be a lion as the villain and Da'Vine Joy Randolph seems like a fish out of water in her role as Loretta's publicist. Not their fault - it's just that their characters were written poorly.Add an uneven plot that is unnecessarily complicated to all of the above and you get 'The Lost City' - just don't go looking for it on a map.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

Bullock. Appealing as usual, and an extended cameo by Brad Pitt are the two saving graces, for their fans, though both are failed by a muddled, simplistic storyline and generally unfunny dialogue.Tatum's man-child demeanor as the protagonist romance novelist (Bullock)'s fellow adventurist-and potential romantic interest, is miscast. Bullock's mega-star presence eclipses his. His super-nice hunky- guy character moons over her, seeming at times as if he's medicated with something that keeps him from displaying emotion. It isn't bad acting- it's emotion-free acting. Bottom-line: the Bullock/Tatum 'chemistry' does not work here. See 'Romancing The Stone' for an example of how this should* have worked. Fan favorite Daniel Radcliffe plays the (far too-mildly) eccentric heavy, pursuing Bullock/Tatum. He seems to try to make the best of the character, but- again- screenplay and direction disappoint.It's 'just' watchable for fans of the cast.. I suppose.","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

The film is about the reclusive novelist Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock), who has become quite popular with her book series. She owes this success partly to Dash the book cover model of her books who is played by the model Alan (Channing Tatum).During her book promotion of her latest book The Lost City of D, Loretta is kidnapped by her wealthy fan Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). With her book knowledge about tombs on which she based her books, he thinks he can find an ancient treasure. Alan, who saw Loretta kidnapped, now tries to rescue her to prove that he is more than just a cover model of her book series. Ending up in the jungles of the Lost City, the two opposites must work together to survive their perilous jungle journey and find the treasure before it falls into the wrong hands. With this film they have made a kind of parody film, which brings out the clichés of other adventure films about hidden tombs in dangerous jungles with booby traps. Fortunately, in addition to the parody film, they were able to give the film its own story. This story itself also commits many of the clichés from the other adventure films, which they try to make a bit ridiculous. This is an entertaining film, but nothing really new or special.Apart from the comedy of the clichés that they try to ridicule, the comedy of the movie itself works best to make the rest of the movie stand out compared to other adventure movies. Unfortunately, many of the comedic moments have already been seen in the trailers, so for a more entertaining experience, try to avoid the trailers. Other aspects that provide the best moments are unfortunately also used the least. As a result, the film is mainly about the contradictory humor between the two main characters. Fortunately, Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum have good chemistry together, which makes their comedic scenes come across better. They actually filmed the film on location, so the directors, together with photography director Jonathan Sela, managed to provide many beautiful images. This also makes the film a bit more realistic compared to other adventure films, which were mainly shot in film studios and were later given a background with a green screen. Most cast members have also been able to perform their own stunts on location. Sandra Bullock manages to return as a comedy star in the cinema world with this cinema film, because before this film she played more in films that were put on streaming services. Together with Channing Tatum she knows how to provide good comedy. Her character often comes across as sarcastic during what she's going through. Her character wears a purple glitter jumpsuit for a large part of the film, which also creates many comic moments. Channing Tatum also knows how to show his comedy sides in this film, with which he has become a talent since 21 Jump Street. In this film he does play a stupid bungler, who is always trying to prove himself. Daniel Radcliffe also knows how to play the villain of the film, but his character is not really well developed in the film. He also sends his accomplices after the duo more often, which means that he has less to do himself. Brad Pitt also has more of a cameo in the film in which he manages to steal the spotlight and you quickly start to miss him when his characters disappear from the film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"6","/10","The lost city - A lost city and a film that lost its way finding it","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8005354/?ref_=tt_urv","eightylicious","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147596293/?ref_=tt_urv","25 March 2022","In the world of American commercial cinema, one thing is clear: Sandra Bullock is the queen of the rom com. From ""The Proposal"" (2014), to ""Two weeks notice"" (2002), or even ""Miss Congeniality"" (2000), Bullock has delivered a string of hits that aren't of the highest quality but are enjoyable enought to be successful. This is also the case with ""The lost city"", which, while being on a higher level than most of Bullock's previous work, fails to deliver a completely satisfying result due to its unsuccessful mix of romance, drama and comedy.In the first scene of the film, we are introduced with a sequence à la ""Le magnifique"" - a 1972 spy parody by Philippe de Broca- to our heroine, the writer Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) and her partner, Alan Caprison (Channing Tatum). These two are trapped in a temple à la Indiana Jones and are almost eaten by snakes. Then, something happens: Loretta can't believe what she sees. Nothing is logical, and everything disappears. It turns out all that was just the imaginary universe where her next book, ""The lost city of D"" takes place. It seems, though, that her book's plot is as illogical to her audience as to Sage. And so, it becomes a complete failure.The only person who cares about the books is a millionaire with the apparently gender-neutral name Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). He is convinced that the book gives the instructions to find a lost city, with its legendary Crown of Fire. So, who better to kidnap in order to help him than poor Loretta? The only problem is, that Alan witnesses the abduction and calls a former Navy Seal, Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt) to help him find her. When Alan is left alone by a sudden event, he will have to free Loretta and cross the jungle with her.So starts this otherwise average film. And it is average because it doesn't know what it wants to be; a romantic comed, a laugh-out-loud movie, or a drama with space for character development. While it starts off as the second one, it slowly, develops into the first, and makes an unsuccessful attempt to become the third kind. To me, though, the result felt a bit dated, like these old Bullock hits I mentioned in the beginning of my review. Channing Tatum could easily be the new Hugh Grant or Ryan Reynolds on the side of Bullock, and if their adventure didn't take place in an ancient city but, in say, an office - of course this would require the plot to change a bit- it would without any doubt be a modernized ""The Proposal"".Regardless, it needs to be said that Tatum and Bullock have good chemistry between them, which just grows stronger as the film progresses. Their best moments are those involving comedy, since they are both hilarious, Bullock with her trademark neuroticism, and Tatum acting as her completely antithetic companion. As for Radcliffe, his portrayal of the villain was maybe too passionate, with him getting annoying after two consecutive hours of hearing his rants and grand visions of finding the Crown.It was the supporting cast that stole the show; Da'Vine Joy Randolph shines as the overstressed manager of Bullock, her constant anxiety making for some unforgettable comedic moments. Oscar Nuñez, who plays an eccentric cargo plane pilot, is perfect as the friendless, desperate for some adventure character. Even Patti Harrison, the actress that here interpreted Bullock's social media manager, is given some excellent lines, with her total indifference to the seriousness of the situation (Bullock being kidnapped) and her fixation with her client's online popularity giving the film its desirable lightheartedness during the beginning of its second half.There is a successful series of books called ""Why mummy..."" , where the heroine presents her life as a working mother of two recalcitrant children. Most chapters start with her describing what would be a perfect day, until reality comes and destroys everything. ""The lost city"" followed this structure, but up to a point. In my opinion, it could have transformed to a hilarious comedy of contradictions between Bullock's dreams of being a brave explorer and her real, bland life. Being a more challenging form of story, this could of course turn off some viewers, but the film wouldn't lose its commercial character at all, actually improving it with an intelligent concept.For all its faults, ""The lost city"" is a film that deserves most of the praise it's getting, since it accomplishes its goal; to be an engaging feature with likeable characters, using its actors' talent well, and offering what I would simply call a typical Bullock vehicle.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Not amazing but a really decent start.The second part of the movie goes down dramatically, the jokes become a tiny bit dumber, many puns don't really land and the editing gets more and more disjointed with each scene. Still watchable but definitely subpar.The main leads made a decent job. I believe Channing Tatum out-acted Sandra Bullock, which sincerely surprised me. However, neither of them were specially great.In the other hand, Daniel Radcliffe and Brad Pitt shined through and through. Radcliffe is capable of portraying a morally ambiguous antagonist in a serious yet funny way. Pitt made me laugh at every turn, he distilled humor at every word he said and every jump he made. Good stuff.Sadly, we don't enjoy much of these characters. Pitt's appearance is more of a cameo and Radcliffe's character becomes flatter and dumber as the time goes by, becoming a caricature of the complex character we met at first. In turn, the movie tries to flesh Tatum and Bullock's relationship out but there's really nothing there, just the same old ""don't judge a book by its cover"" kind of unlikely couple we've seen a million times already.All in all, it's an innocuous silly rom-com with some very decent action and special effects and a story that, while not really innovative, is mostly out of the ordinary. I expected to laugh more, probably some changes to the script could have made a better flick, but all in all, it's ok.Do I regret spending two hours watching it? Nope, it was good enough. Would I remember its plot and characters in six months? Probably not. Would I watch it again? Oh no, thank you.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In no way is it on par with 'Raiders', or even 'Jewel of the Nile'--but it has a pleasing cast, a doable story if you don't look for too much logic, and a sense of fun. We all know Bullock has Oscar caliber acting chops, so she has a right to do something silly sometimes-and it's a delight watching her tap into her ditzy schtick. She plays well off Tatum's less-talented but serviceable reluctant-hero clone (the infamous ""cheek shot"" got him more attention than his acting) and they do radiate some charisma. It would have been interesting to see Brad Pitt in a bigger role rather than the precious few scenes he got, but all told it's worth at least one watch-just for the Saturday-afternoon movie-ness of it all.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Very light reimagining of Romancing the Stone","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8191821/?ref_=tt_urv","siderite","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3146136/?ref_=tt_urv","31 May 2022","The similarities with Romancing the Stone are evident, but the film is not a remake or a reboot or anything, just similar. Sandra Bullock is a romance writer fed up with the industry in which she works and dreaming of more. So she gets more, via Daniel Radcliffe who does a rather menacing yet funny psychopathic villain who kidnaps her. It is time for romantic interest (and 16 years younger) Channing Tatum to come to the rescue, even when he is completely clueless. The film goes from there, being entertaining and decently funny.I have to say here that Sandra is still beautiful and there is real chemistry between all the characters, but Brad Pitt just steals the show. Poof! It's gone! No more show for you, Bullock and Tatum. Pitt basically does a cameo like in Deadpool and is confident and good looking and amazingly funny. He elevates the film just by showing up.There is also the issue of the obligatory Black person that I would not want to get into, but it's impossible to avoid. She just has to be female, weird, bossy, ""ethnic"" in order to check off all the boxes, but her character just comes off as manipulative, annoying, pushy, hungry and mostly insensitive, because at the end she ""has your back, girl!"". And she also protects her investment while at it. If I would want as many people as possible to become racist, I would just plop one heavily overweight black person playing an obnoxious and unnecessary character in every movie. That's exactly what happens here!Bottom line: there are huge leaps of faith necessary to enjoy this film without rolling your eyes, but it was never supposed to be serious. It is a very light comedy that presents even an island jungle as a green and clean place where you can ride your motorbike between trees and islanders who just go on with their daily lives while a volcano is erupting. As such, it was fun to watch, but I wouldn't really recommend it.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's a tongue-in-cheek film in the Harrison Ford model.Loretta Sage (Sandra Bulluck) is an academic who used to work with her archeologist husband, who died five years earlier. They studied early Atlantic cultures. After that, she turned to writing romance novels but has retreated more and more to her home. She is finally coaxed by her publicist Beth (Da'Vine Joy Randolph), to undertake a tour with the cover model for all her books. Alan Caprison (Channing Tatum). Alan is always the character Dash McMahon in her novels, in which she is the model for the Angela character. He looks good but really isn't very competent at anything.Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) is the bitter older brother in a wealthy family. He didn't get the family business but pursues treasure, in this case, the ""Crown of Fire"" left by an early Atlantic culture. In reading Loretta's last book, he realizes she can read cuneiform-type writing and kidnaps her to assist in finding the treasure.The film then follows the adventure as Abigail tries to force Loretta to find the treasure while Beth and Alan try to rescue her. Alan briefly works with a former Navy Seal, Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt), to save Loretta but finally has to work directly with Loretta to escape the villains. Their adventure forms the plot of Loretta's next book.You'll probably enjoy the movie if you like Sandra Bullock and adventure humor. Brad Pitt is amazing in his cameo role as Jack Trainer. Daniel Radcliffe is a little odd as a master villain. However, some other characters fit stereotypes for this kind of movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Enough to immediately assume that the overall film will be a rating lower than what I've given it; the Q&A scene hammered that home for me. That awkward humor, topped with perpetual silence because some people want to make you suffer, is second-hand embarrassment galore. People who love that probably exist, and I'm perplexed.However, that was only the case until the meat of it all started making headway, beginning with the introduction of Daniel Radcliffe's character, followed by the arrival at the island. It gradually improved from there, much to my relief, regarding the escape from that humor and the enjoyment increase.The main cast (Sandra Bullock, Channing Tatum, Daniel Radcliffe), including the supporting cast (Da'Vine Joy Randolph, Oscar Nuñez, Brad Pitt), were all good and contributed massively (Patti Harrison was alright) to the enjoyment of this film. That wouldn't have been as much of the case if the writing (the Nee Brothers, Oren Uziel, Dana Fox, revolved around the story by Seth Gordon) wasn't also good; the directing, too, also by the Nee Brothers.Speaking of the supporting cast, specifically Brad Pitt, I want to mention my surprise about him being in this film. I remember reading a few things about it back in 2021, which included that. Well, I forgot. And something about Jack Trainer's voice over the phone was stroking my subconscious. That's why. He barely had any screen time (nowhere near enough, mind you), but he was one of the highlights. His ""status"" is at a level where his little screen time is understandable.The best aspects beyond the cast were the cinematography by Jonathan Sela (the visuals looked excellent and picturesque, helped by the work of the location managers, Boni Canto and Isidro J. González) and the action-adventure genre, specifically the adventure part.The whole 'adventure/exploration of ancient places, maybe to also find ancient treasure' thing has a particular appeal; the nice-to-look-at locations/scope of the world-building probably plays a factor. I may like it more than the murder mystery/whodunit sub-genre, for example, as I watched Murder Mystery two films ago, although it's still pretty close.The most lackluster, although not THAT lackluster or that big of a deal, aspect was the chemistry between the two leads. Both Channing and Sandra had more chemistry with Brad. Yes, romantic chemistry. Yes, Channing and Brad, too. Channing and Sandra had more comedy-duo chemistry than romantically.I'd welcome a second film but with a catch. Brad Pitt must return and have a more prominent role. Adding to that, it should revolve around all three of them. The trio was better than the duo. Hell, add a threesome into the mix. Why not? Come on, don't be shy and prudish. Don't ""reserve"" something like that for films like Fifty Shades of Grey/that trilogy only.With a better first half and the short-lived trio of Channing, Sandra, and Brad, the action-adventure element did most of the work here, followed by specific characters, particularly Abigail Fairfax.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Daniel Radcliffe has to work hard to get his character to rise above buff and beauty, which he does admirably. Don't expect much logic or reason in the stunts, since it is a fantasy from the start.

It is a great adventure comedy for when you don't really want to think, but you don't want something super dumb. The writing was much more clever than I expected and I actually laughed aloud a few times, which is a rarity regardless.As with all other movies I watch, I went in quite stoned and without watching the trailer, though I had seen frames and tiny bits and pieces. Pitt and Radcliffe definitely stole the show. Channing Tatum and Sandra Bullock have good chemistry and they both grow during the film, which I guess is pretty likable. But there was good character development all around. The bits held up pretty well throughout. And though a lot of the film universe is fake, the plot is more or less realistic, and realistic enough to enjoy.For movies like these, I usually don't pay too much attention to the cinematography or sound and whatnot, but there were some good solid songs at appropriate times. The scenery is quite beautiful, and volcanoes are fun.Honestly, I'd recommend it. It kept my attention throughout the entire film almost completely, which I'd say is very good for an adventure comedy. The story was cute and quite strong; the characters had some really exceptional lines. They might even make some people snort-laugh, though that really isn't my jam or jelly.Just give it a whirl. If you like any of the actors/actresses or if you like adventure and exploration movies, or if you like a smartly-enough written comedy, you'll find the gamble was worth it, and may even come out pleasantly surprised.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Fear no further dear reader, to the rescue comes what possibly is the longest cameo in film history: Brad Pitt. Pitt's carachter is perhaps the most interesting and better developed one, stealing scenes and hearts at every heroic glance. One could even argue that this dude even deserves a spin-off of his own. But if a cameo is truly the highlight of an entire film, that's not saying much, is it? Save from the hysterical physical comedy of Sandra Bullock and a few well-oiled jokes, there is not much left for the audience but a few giggles. Still, The Lost City is a pretty exciting and light movie to keep the audiences entertained on a rainy day.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Channing Tatum has one thing: Pretty, and he uses it well here. There are some funny moments, but nothing that had me rolling on the floor. It's a good rainy afternoon kind of movie.

Dan Radcliffe is really coming into his own now and is no longer the boyish wizard, he is a believable villain here with plenty of charisma and solid professional chops. Sandra Bullock looks remarkably well and has a remarkable amount of energy for her age. Fair play to her also for continually being able to have a laugh at herself through her career. The story doesn't make a lot of sense but it provides some laughs and is lighthearted entertainment for a Friday night. Brad Pitt's cameo also brings some laughs.

It is more so saddening when you sit down and think about the fact that this film failed to deliver despite having the likes of Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum on its list.I'm in no way denying their capabilities or the reputation they hold as performers, as they had ascertained their merit time and again in the past but here, in this case, they just don't seem to find their footings. I can't recall the last time I had seen Ms. Bullock this much lost and disinterested in a role! The same goes for Tatum, he might not be a known 'thespian' amongst the audience yet I must say he's usually pretty good with comic stuff. Not in this, here he's just a shadow of his former self.In all seriousness, I never expected this to be anything greater than a popcorn flick, no, that would have been a silly belief. However, what I did expect though was to amuse myself with its idiosyncrasy, and to have a bit of fun in the process. Sadly, that wasn't meant to be and now I'm greatly discontented.P. S.

I also like those old school action and stunt performances without CGI more - no matter what the producers want to make us believe, too many times (not in The Lost City alone) the digital effects just looks artificial and it's rather boring because we know that everything is faked in front of a green screen. All in all no failure and watchable, especially if you like the stars of the movie: Sandra Bullock, Brad Pitt, Channing Tatum and Daniel Radcliffe (who all make a solid performance). But in the end The Lost City is nothing really remarkable, and for sure rather disappointing if one considers the starpower, but well, the script was not up to the task to make them shine more. I also would apply some serious cutting - there are some lengthy parts that are just taking away the momentum of the plot without adding something substantially to the story.","12 out of 26 found this helpful.

However, with an overbearing book cover model Allan (Channing Tatum), and pressure from her tour manager, Loretta has been struggling to write her final book. Luckily, she is swept off her feet and thrown into the reality of her own novels. Loretta must learn to put her pride aside and work with the people that care for her to escape the island that they're stuck on.The sound and visuals in The Lost City really stand out to me-I am amazed at how clear the audio is. All of the fighting scenes feel so real, without being overbearing. Plus the picture quality is top-notch. Everything feels very realistic, and it's almost as if we are really there. I am very impressed with the acting, too. Each actor grabbed my attention the entire time. For example, Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum's chemistry is so strong, and they make their characters very believable. Lastly, the storyline is so interesting. There's a fun twist to it, and the story is overall unexpected. There are so many different elements, plus it is also a comedic experience. I personally love a good laugh, because it lightens the mood, and this movie definitely does that.The message of The Lost City is that being greedy and evil will never get you anywhere. In the end love will always win. This film does have some violent scenes including fighting and the use of guns.I give The Lost City 4.5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 10 to 18, plus adults.

It's flat, poorly scripted, and only contains a few chuckles. Most of the funny parts were given away in the trailer and the moral is incredibly predictable.Bullock and Tatum give it their best shot to have some screwball-esque chemistry but it's not believable and the supporting cast is actually funnier. Radcliffe (and even Tatum) tries to be charming, but just comes across as formulaic.It must be much harder to write a good Rom-Com than I thought because despite (what I hope was) a valiant effort by all who were involved, The Lost City just feels lazy and uninspired. It's as if they knew there were major flaws but hoped we as the viewers would be distracted by the shiny view (that view being Tatum's body, the pretty scenery, and literally Bullock's shiny outfit). We deserve better.Verdict: Don't Watch.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

When they talk about their backstory or their story in why they do what they do you understand where they are coming from.Daniel Radcliffe is a great actor, and he is good in this movie, and you do believe his role as the bratty villain looking for treasure, but I thought they should have given more explanation for his reason in doing this. Even though Brad Pitt is only in some scenes he did an excellent job, and his character was funny in the scenes he was in.There are nice looking camera shots in the jungle and in big wide shots of the island that looked pretty and nice to look at. The action scenes that movie had in the jungle was shot well and entertaining to watch along with it just looking nice when they are on walking through on their adventure.There were some scenes that were not funny but if you look past that you will laugh at the actual funny lines and scenes.

Brad Pitt and Oscar Nuñez are particularly great in their limited screen time. Daniel Radcliffe as the villain gives it everything he's got too but it's just not a very well written villain. He's not very menacing and doesn't have any memorable attributes.The film starts to drag near the end as well. The last 20-30 minutes feel like they take an eternity.

Everything is supremely cliched in the most predictable way. As in the character dynamics are based on old movie formulas that you can guess ahead of time with minimum surprises. The only thing missing is the sassy black woman and bumbling cops. Wait, nope, they got those in there too. The plot doesn't make any sense from who's involved in the overall adventure. An ""evil genius"" who is ignoring using experts for his plan. It makes you question why the hell wouldn't he go for someone who could actually help. Why aren't the people on the rescue team from local authorities? The bad dick jokes that make dad jokes look genius. I guess it's worth it if you want a movie to play as background noise while you're cleaning on the weekend. 2 stars because of the actors involved, but that's about it. People are saying that the ""intentional banality of the movie is on purpose. That's what makes it great!"". I'm just going to say I've been cliche movies done right and this one isn't one of them.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Will hopefully disappear without a trace within a couple of years.Incredibly implausible premise, I wouldn't even call it entertaining.

The story is interesting, and even though it takes several directions, I think it's an easy story to follow, as its characters have decent development and some can be more endearing than others. The romantic situation is predictable despite the circumstances the characters find themselves in, which are different from what we usually see in romantic movies. The performances are decent, but I think Channing Tatum does an outstanding job compared to the other cast, Sandra Bullock has more talent to give a better performance, although this one was not bad. The locations where it was filmed are good, reflecting the difficulty of the journey through the jungle, the editing is not good since there are many scenes that you can tell were cut very suddenly and there are some others where there is action and you can't see it well what's going on.I think it doesn't work at all as a comedy that doesn't take itself seriously, but if it can give us a story that's a little different from what we're used to seeing in romantic comedies, it still needed more work on the script to be memorable and to be a good comedy, especially with how talented the cast is, which is the best part of the movie.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Is it filled with swarms of insects or dangerous animals? Is it tranquil and beautiful?No, its just a bunch of trees that Sandra and Channing can run around so that is enough.There are some great moments (especially with Brad Pitt) and the main characters have great potential - with snippets of insight.But on the whole it doesn't feel like anyone cares about this.I love Sandra Bullock but she doesn't bring any of her talent or energy to this. I didn't buy she was an author, an academic or a widow - she is just there goofing around.About a quarter of the cast can just be cut along with all their scenes and the film would be better for it.There are a lot of dad-jokes and obligatory embarrassment gags ""oh gosh! I can see your penis"" or ""oh no! My dress is up my bum!"" which is probably funny if you are about ten.I was really hoping for another Jumanji or Jungle Cruise but instead got a very long made-for-TV movie that is already fading from my memory.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

And I have to admit that ""don't judge a book by its cover"" rule does not apply here whatsoever as this is just a case of judging it for exactly what it is - a piece of shlock.The screenplay to ""The lost city' was written by 4 people and none of them was even slightly funny or innovative with it. Even if I were a ten year old I would have probably not died laughing at some of the scenes, - now I only scowled and rolled my eyes all the time. Sandra is a versatile actress and she can act so I don't get why she agreed to do this humorless ""Romancing the stone"" rip-off in the first place; her character, Channing's, Daniel's and every other is not just paper-thin - they're sand, you go 'puff' and the whole character vanishes in the air without a trace of interest.The script in general is lazy writing through and through and at times I felt like most of the dialogues were improvised on the spot and left in the movie for whatever reasons - I just can't see someone with a tiny bit of talent writing those pathetic dialogues passing around from character to character.Overall I feel like the movie industry rapidly degenerates because I remember some twenty years ago I thoroughly enjoyed the similarly themed ""The rundown"" with Dwayne Johnson or ""National treasure"" with Nicolas Cage - those were also dumb, over the top adventure flicks but they've had deeper characters that you cared for and a nice story to stick around for but ""The lost city"" has neither of those criteria. In fact it doesn't have anything good to say about, I can only vaguely compliment Channing Tatum's feeble attempts at bringing his character some depth but they were mostly left unnoticed behind the huge cringe of the whole movie so please do judge a book by its cover (if you've read many and know your books) and don't waste your precious time.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

At 54, Bullock is way too old for this kind of material (Turner was 30 when she made RTS), making Channing Tatum seem too young for his role as cover model Alan, the man Loretta falls for. The age gap mightn't have mattered so much if the pair had some kind of on-screen chemistry, but they are unable to replicate the Turner/Douglas magic, their supposedly funny banter more irritating than amusing. Meanwhile, Daniel Radcliffe as villain Abigail Fairfax is just terrible - how does this guy continue to have an acting career?Only Brad Pitt impresses with his cameo, playing a rugged Special Ops agent hired to rescue kidnapped Loretta: he embraces the stupidity of his role and looks like he's having a lot of fun parodying the macho stereotype.

Although, that might also be a way to distract from the lack of jokes. The dialogue tries to show the characters' vulnerable and romantic sides, but I have a hard time believing even the biggest romantic would have any emotional reaction to their verbal and physical exchanges, other than pure cringe.Brad Pitt is good in his short appearance, and there are definitely funny moments in the movie.Unfortunately, they all appear in the trailer.It's not a disaster, it's just not good.I suggest Romancing the Stone, or any of the classic Indiana Jones movies if you're into romantic adventure/archeology flicks.Or ""Spy"" with Melissa McCarthy if you feel like a good laugh.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Joan ventures out of the safety of her New York City apartment into a Colombian jungle to save her sister from smugglers. She meets Jack, and their romantic adventures begin, ultimately leading to Joan's next best seller. Meanwhile, Jack shows up in New York, to fulfill the the promise of more romance with Joan. The film captured a fan base & began an era of movies in the Rom-Com-Adventure genre.The Lost City features Sandra Bullock as romance novelist, Loretta Sage. Loretta, a widow, has painfully cranked out another installment in her romantic adventure series, which features a dashing hero, aptly named Dash. Loretta is bullied by her publisher into going on tour to promote the book. Channing Tatum plays the part of Alan Caprison, a model who stars as Dash during a promo appearance. When Dash's long-tressed blond wig falls off, and he's out of character, he's just Alan, a bumbling puppy dog with a crush on Loretta. Meanwhile, Loretta is kidnapped by Daniel Radcliffe, a billionaire amateur archaeologist, for her translation skills (she's a closet nerd who writes romance novels to pay the bills). Radcliffe wants Loretta to decode some hieroglyphics in order to find lost treasure. Brad Pitt joins the action for a brief stint as a rescue consultant & spiritual adviser. He plays the part of a real Dash, in contrast to Alan. He's only there for the usual Brad Pitt sex appeal. Unfortunately, Tatum's attempt at bumbling humor, a la Ryan Reynolds, never gets liftoff. Bullock, a pro at comic timing, has nothing to work with here. Hence, her valiant attempts to inject humor fall flat.Actually, the whole movie is just embarrassing. Sandra Bullock, Brad Pitt, Channing Tatum, and Daniel Radcliffe surely had something better to do than get involved with this turkey.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

But not this time. Everybody in this dull adventure seemed like they were asleep, or distracted. Zero chemistry between the two principles (Bullock and Tatum), or between anyone. I kept imagining the directors being satisfied with each bland take and looking up from their iPhones and saying, ""Okay. Cut! I think we got it. Check the gate."" (That was unfair, I'm sure the directors/writers, the Nee bros, were on top of every take.And then there's the so-called McGuffin, some vaguely described ""Crown of Fire"". So pedestrian and ill-described that you often forgot about what everybody was looking for. Radcliffe (I'm sure he loved the idea of trying to play a villain, weakly), who's supposed to be some sort of Elon Musk mega-billionaire, is obsessed to the point of risking his entire fortune with this obtaining this geegaw.Then, as each character has that obligatory revelation scene to relate their backstory, you are struck by how boring all those stories are. It's like the script just said, ""insert backstory here."" Bullock's character was supposed to have once been a successful archaeologist but then she inexplicably got into writing bodice-ripper trash novels...yeah, there's a believable thread. Alan (Tatum) was just a good looking nobody in high school, then college, and ended up as a highly paid male model (how sad). Even the supporting characters' revelatory backstories are pointless.Just what was the point of this whole movie? Yeah, yeah, yeah...I know it's supposed to be a comedy.

Although the film is at a lower level of special effects compared to films with big budgets, it uses visual effects to the highest extent. Very elegantly, for example, the part that shows the waterfall... we feel like we are seeing and feeling the waterfall up close. This movie has a script and this is important. Something that we don't see in many movies like this. I can only say that it's a good and accurate movie, it's exciting.A very beautiful, artistic and magnificent film at the same time simple and unpretentious. This movie entertains you with cinema and teaches you the meaning of cinema without using technological and intellectual tricks.

But it fails at being properly fascinating like Romancing the Stone was. It feels like a cheap lazy copy in comparison. The budget is great, the acting fine, and much of the action is good. The main issue that drags it down is how terrible Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum are as a love interest couple. Not a single scene between them works in any way whatsoever. The main story is fine. A middle-aged author writes romance novels. Her husband is dead and she refuses to leave the house. So of course she ends up on a dangerous adventure. It's cliche and could work, but it doesn't. She's funny 20% of the time in the weird situations the rest of the time she's just acting quirky and it doesn't work as she's a middle-aged woman with a botox face and mediocre comedy skills. Maybe a young woman experiencing similar stuff could sell the role? Channing Tatum is the very stupid model who tries to save her while constantly screwing up. And she doesn't like him as he's stupid. Yeah, that's it. She just doesn't like stupid guys. They don't do anything more with this conflict. Of course they have to be forced together via the plot. It's basically Romancing the Stone with a few rewrites. But Romancing the Stone took a silly idea and made it good by creating a great plot around it DESPITE the concept. Here they fully and lazily rely on forcing silly romance situations and they never feel real or funny as you can see how the writer and director forced the silly scenes to happen. So the romance is utterly dead here and replaced by cringe.The big positive is the great island setting and the funny Daniel Radcliffe. Daniel Radcliffe actually hits all his comedy marks and makes it funny. The rest are just trying to act silly and the comedy falls flat. So while much of the movie works and the script never becomes bad the overall product is a letdown. It's not really a movie I can recommend. It does the bare minimum of big budget Hollywood production, but as the humor falls flat it's a failed comedy. As the romance falls flat it's a failed romance. And there is not enough action to carry the movie by itself. You'd need to cut out 15 min of romance and another 15 min of silly comedy to make it work. Then you'd have a silly short acceptable movie. As of now it's just way too cringe overall. Many scenes are clearly there to stretch out the movie runtime and totally pointless and boring. They are added in to make it long enough and it's painfully obvious. The movie drags a ton in some scenes which for a comedy is a dead sentence. But it's not completely bad in all aspects. It just feels pointless and has too many boring scenes to be worth it overall.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

To its credit, the film's leads have genuine chemistry throughout and have some funny scenes together. There are also some over the top antics and cameos that are downright hilarious. However the film falters agonizingly through an overdone and predictable plot as well as a being painfully boring. It was clear throughout that the film desperately needed an outlandish performance from its cast or something to truly stick out in a pool of forgettable comedies, but this film takes the blandest route in its execution. It didn't help that the characters didn't seem too interested in the adventure occurring until the end, which should tell the audience about how much care they should give to the film overall. Despite the films obvious flaws and bland execution though, it wasn't completely unwatchable with some redeeming qualities.

I was not disappointed!One reviewer called it a throwback comedy and I stole that from them. It's a perfect description. There are a lot of surprises in it - or there were for me, but I'm sort of naive. I don't look up most movies or shows before I watch them. I like an element of surprise because I don't want to ruin them by expecting too much from them.This was just plain fun on a lot of levels. The good guys were good and the bad guys were deliciously bad! Daniel Radcliff never disappoints. He never ceases to amaze me in his versatility. Once again, he knocks this character out of the park - and holds his own with Bullock.SO! If you need a mindless movie to clear your brain - this is it! Sit back and let them do all the work! You sit back and enjoy.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Bored my partner and me. This received much praise from reviewers for acting and laughs yet I never laughed once and the acting is beyond cheesy.Although it's good to see Brad try to snap himself out of his substance bubble and step up to a role, his action scenes were too cheesy and he appeared to struggle through even with movement. Leave it be now Brad! Oh and don't get me started on the long hair.Sandra likes this kind of laid back comedy. It's better for her when she doesn't have to put too much effort in now apart from wear a low cut dress and hold her head high. With help from the nip tuck she's aged well and can still act but she is far from convincing here and much like her A-list neighbours, much of what she's done of late has been awful.Finally, Channing had a few flashes of why he was picked he was quite fun but not funny. People if you be honest for a change you only speak highly of him here because it's Channing and because of his magic Mike seemingly aging presence. He already looks past his best and he's not even near brads age. His character wasn't interesting, just annoying, the same as Channings latest movies.Be honest, cinema has changed. But that's the audiences fault as much as anyone's for liking this cheesy, lame stuff we're subjected to nowadays. Your not easy to please except when it comes to eye candy and flashy silly stuff - then that's fine, whether or not that eye candy is past it's sell by date. Think about it, Harry Potter, Brad Pitt, Sandra and magic mike all in leads with some flashy scenery and Indiana Jones type of feel, of course people would rate this movie highly and enjoy. That's why these actors were selected. To try and sell you what was a really bad script. Get real.Nice try but you're not fooling me. Sure it's fun to relax isn't it Channing and co? But living a little and enjoying winding down or trying to restart isn't the same as actually doing a good job.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

My excitement to watch this film knew no bounds, especially given the star-studded cast it boasted. It rekindled my childhood enthusiasm for adventurous treasure hunts on hidden islands, deciphering cryptic hieroglyphics, and embarking on thrilling escapades.At the heart of the movie are two protagonists: Loretta Sage (played by Sandra Bullock), a romance novelist, and Alan/Dash (portrayed by Channing Tatum), her renowned cover model. Loretta's novel, ""The Lost City of D,"" tantalizes readers with its enigmatic title, sparking wild speculations. But it's not what you might assume. Their journey unfolds on a perilous expedition to an uncharted paradise island, albeit not of their own volition. Loretta is kidnapped by a delusional, bittersweet billionaire, a media mogul who believes she holds the key to discovering treasure in a lost city on that very island, mirroring the plot of her own book.My initial expectation, fueled by uproarious laughter induced by the trailer, was that this movie would captivate me from start to finish. Regrettably, that wasn't the case. It turned out to be somewhat lackluster, with moments of disappointment and monotony. Nevertheless, the same scenes that had amused me in the trailer still had me in stitches, along with some previously unseen gems. These redeeming moments make me inclined to recommend the film to others. I would, however, temper my recommendation by acknowledging that it may not live up to the hype but is still suitable for a laid-back day of viewing. Given the track record of Brad Pitt, Channing Tatum, and Sandra Bullock, I can't recall a single instance where their performances have fallen flat. Consequently, I attribute any shortcomings solely to the production team.The plot was passable, while the storyline struck me as a bit wishy-washy. Certain segments left me pondering, ""Why was that even included?"" Additionally, I have reservations about the casting choices. Sandra and Channing certainly embodied their roles, and Brad Pitt, while fitting his character, seemed an unconventional choice for this particular storyline or genre. Frankly, I don't envision him as a comedic actor. I regret to say that Daniel Radcliffe felt out of place in this ensemble. He was an exceptional child actor in the Harry Potter series, but this role didn't suit him. I found myself wincing, thinking, ""No, perhaps it's time to step away from acting."" The remaining cast members appeared disengaged and seemed to be present merely to fulfill their roles in making a movie, resulting in characters that felt lackluster.Maybe I should consider watching a 'behind the scenes' episode to uncover the rationale behind that rather questionable outfit (the onesie) they dressed Loretta in. I must admit, I found it quite dreadful. Sandra Bullock possesses an enviable physique, especially for her age, but that suit felt entirely out of place, even for a book interview. The color choice was off, and sequins? Seriously? I couldn't help but wonder, what kind of novelist wears a sequin onesie? And let's not forget about Beth's eyebrows... I suppose we were meant to take notice because they certainly stood out prominently.Now, on to the peculiar moment when Alan covers his eyes as he asks Loretta, in a state of undress, to 'check his front' for leeches. It's a puzzling choice, to say the least. But credit where it's due, I appreciated the witty wordplay with the quote, ""oh your plucky warrior hangs in tranquil solitude,"" which did manage to elicit a giggle from me.All in all, I'd say it's a passable movie to watch, primarily for the sheer delight of witnessing these acclaimed actors share the screen. However, it might have caused a slight dent in their status as actors and actresses, given some of the creative choices and moments in the film.Is 'cheese & rice' supposed to be a substitute for Jesus Christ? Just wondered.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The filming was incredible and the locations looked absolutely beautiful (I know it wasn't as cool actually being there in the jungle). How they captured the mood in the setting was perfect and how they created a spot-on and talented cast was remarkable. The plot was kind of predictable but most of the action and adventure in it was involving comedy and drama. I'd love to see another movie like this but with the same actor as (one of) the antagonist(s). The movie in conclusion was spectacular.Ok, I'm a guy and this movie is probably supposed to be enjoyed by women but I loved it so much. I love these adventure movies so much. The acting is superb and the plot is excellent. I would rewatch it in a second.

Her late husband was an archeologist and she based some of her writings on his findings. They were on a mission to find the Crown of Fire when he died.Her latest book describes the Crown of Fire and billionaire Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Readcliffe) - determined to find this jewel - kidnaps Loretta so she can decipher a tribal language which might lead to the location of the Crown of Fire. The cover model of 20 of her books, Alan (Channing Tatum), hires a CIA operative, Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt), to find her, and he goes along on the rescue mission. They follow her to an island, where Abigail took her.With a volcano on the island threatening to erupt, time is of the essence and the film therefore is a race against time. I enjoyed the adventure element and the location allowed for some beautiful cinematography. Although the film is a bit slapstick at times, it was otherwise quite funny. There was maybe a bit too much humour for my liking, but this is a comedy after all.Channing Tatum is in great shape with an awesome body. I couldn't quite place his character, though. Although Alan is the film's romantic lead, he came across as gay more often than not. He even remarked ""He loved me"", referring to Jack Trainer. And he packs face masks, ointment, and a nail file on a rescue mission! Not to mention him screaming like a girl on several occasions, and slapping the enemy instead of hitting them with his fists...I love treasure hunt movies and 'The Lost City' was indeed entertaining. I was expecting more for the film's climax, but it was all good still. This is the perfect family movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Then it ends.The film mercilessly begins by offering no more than.0001352 teaspoon of character development. Tidbits of their backgrounds are offered up throught the course of the film, but the window of opportunity to care for a character's arc (or even the pseudo-plot) is nailed and cemented shut.The attempted on-screen chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum was probably the only humourous aspect of the film.

It had all the potential of ""Indiana Jones"" meets ""Romancing the Stone"" meets ""The African Queen"" but came nowhere close to any of those classics. And I suppose that is too much to ask but in spite of so much appealing talent cast, this was a ridiculous and boring snooze-fest. No chemistry between the too-old Bullock and the too-young Tatum. The Radcliff character had so many contradictions that he was neither funny, evil, sympathetic, or interesting. Pitt is a highlight but his role is far too limited. The plot made no sense and was beyond anything you could suspend your disbelief to embrace. ZZZZZ.....","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Of course I reflected on having watched Romancing The Stone back in the day. Movies were a much bigger deal back then. I don't know if it was because it was a pandemic movie but I predicted the look of the film. It's Bullock and Tatum in from of CGI backgrounds (very well done, mind you) and stand-ins for the wider location shots. Some of the sets seemed 100% authentic, yes, but nothing beats having the actors on real locations. But, like I said, the pandemic caused heaps of problems for folks wanting to travel.Sandra Bullock has been the biggest mainstream comedy/drama/all-rounder actress of my adult life.

I love her, she is such a beautiful, incredibly good looking woman, she is a good actor too, and I like her quirkiness, but in this movie she just looked like she is done with everything. I could just feel like she is not satisfied with the role. She showed no joy, acted like she was tired, and like she couldn't wait for everything to end. And there was not one single spark between her and Channing Tatum! Maybe poor guy did want the spark to happen, but she was just not into it. There WAS a spark though between her and Brad Pitt, but that was not the point.And OMG why was this movie so LONG?? It should have lasted 1 hour and 15 mins tops.Don't get me wrong, Sandra, Channing and Brad were the only people who knew how to act in this movie, the rest were just unpleasant to watch. Too bad though, cause I really like Sandra's comedies, just not this one.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I mean, wow. That was bad. Seriously bad. If you're going to steal the basic idea of an old (and good) movie, you've got to do better than this. Romancing the Stone was funny, full of action, and had great performances from a cast that worked well together. And it had excellent production values. This looked like a bad telemovie. Don't know what Sandra Bullock was doing in this. Daniel Ratcliffe proved once again that he is the luckiest man alive to have been cast as Harry Potter as a 10 year old, because he got to be a multi millionaire with virtually no visible talent. The one bright moment was Brad Pitt's cameo. I've never been a big fan, but his ten minutes made you realise how big the difference is between an A List actor and...whoever it was playing the love interest in this. The two stars I've given the movie are his; the rest of the movie is a big, flat zero.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

They were really trying too hard!There were also a lot of continuity bloopers, which was really irritating. First, Daniel Radcliffe donning white cotton gloves to hand a box over to Sandra Bullock (very early in the film) then taking it back a moment later without gloves on. Sandra at the bottom of a cliff with her hair in a chignon. Then halfway up, with hair long and flowing.

The film is conceived as a remake/rip-off of Romancing the Stone but the people in charge never bothered to develop the script past this first conceit.The film is extraordinarily lazy and rehashed, checking off narrative boxes and filmed in the obligatorily flat, unconvincing monotone of contemporary cinema. It's a stunning return for sentimental, schmaltzy romcoms after the release Marry Me just a month ago. Is it possible the dam is just beginning to burst? Is it possible some of them will be funny?The film follows romance novelist Loretta Sage as she's kidnapped and taken to a remote island by billionaire Abigail Fairfax, who seeks a magnificent ancient treasure. Hot on their trail is Sage's cover model Alan, out to prove he's more than just a pretty face. Along the way, the two learn about the peril and pleasures of love, professional gratification, and self-esteem.This film is bland. Everything is weirdly sterilized and glossy, starting with the script. The above bit about not developing the script past the initial premise was not a joke. There are several promising moments in The Lost City which begin to be setup but are immediately abandoned halfway through. The only consistent source of attempted humor is the glibness of the cast, who are uniformly aloof. The only bold choice The Lost City makes is bringing a rough draft into production.The direction is equally lazy and bare. Most of the visual landscape is flat and uninteresting, despite the film being shot almost entirely on location in the Dominican Republic. Why directors Aaron and Adam Nee decided to aim for a synthesized, glamorous veneer for a deadly jungle is anyone's guess. Smart money's on studio mandates of course, but whatever the case, the decision doesn't work. Sage and Alan's trek through the jungle looks like a comfortable camping trip, and hardly any of the cast seem to be physically exerting in the slightest. For all its faults, Romancing the Stone didn't completely ignore the ""action"" in action/romcom.The cast can't come close to saving the material, but at least it looks like they're having fun. Every performer is nestled deep within their comfort zone: Sandra Bullock as a frustrated but fierce author trying to turn the tables on her captor, Channing Tatum as a meatheaded lunk trying to prove himself as a capable, responsible adult, Brad Pitt as a hunky but enigmatic savior, Daniel Radcliffe as a psychopathic but blandly polite spoiled punk, and Da'Vine Joy Randolph as a sassy, exasperated editor. They all play into the glib, spiceless material.There's just not much to anything here. The action is lifeless and obligatory, the structure is hopelessly rote, and the few jokes consistently fall flat. The Lost City is as shallow as a kiddie pool, crassly recycling tropes and characters from other, better films and hoping no one's the wiser. It's weird to even see this type of movie in the theater. Non-vulgar romcoms have been dead for the better part of a decade, so one would think Nees and company would at least put a little effort into the resurgence. One would be wrong. See it if it's your chosen genre, but don't expect anything fresh or innovative; The Lost City picks up right where Anna Faris and Katherine Heigl left off. Abysmal.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Sandra Bullock makes a decent straight man for his lame jokes. I guess I should mention Chaning Tatum, but there really no reason to. The acting? Is barely believable and the silly plot and script were probably written on the car ride into work on a cell phone. This film is not exactly rocket science, nor is it the greatest treasure hunt ever told. As a matter of fact, it is pretty ho-hum from the beginning of the film onward. No one should be forced to fork over ten bucks for this average fare when there are so many other superior options. Don't bother.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

But these reviews are why nobody risks making comedy flicks anymore. If you go into it expecting a masterpiece, than yes, you will be sorely disappointed. But if you are just looking for some laughs and a good time?? The Lost City does not disappoint! Great humor, great cast, great acting, absolute beautiful scenes at times, and an interesting (however cliche that it may be) premise to boot. A film that keeps you wanting more. The character development started out strong and falters a little bit on the second half. They could have developed the chemistry a little more, but it was solid and enjoyable. This film deserves a high rating to make up for the haters. This definitely deserves higher than a 6.1 on IMDB and is much better than the typical cheesy rom-coms they come out with these days. Let's stop being so
harsh and critical of comedy movies! They are not SUPPOSED to be anything of epic proportions but just a couple hours of fun and giggles. Why does everything have to be so serious and deep? We are a culture to worried about offending people.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Nothing but a really, really weak copy of 1984's ""Romancing the Stone"".Sandra Bullock, absolutely unconvincing in her part. Probably not her fault, because they gave her very little to work with. As this romance novelist and awkward, insecure, can't find a husband, hate my life, because I write trash, but really, I'm actually an intelligent, girly girl thrown into an adventure. And there you have it, the next novel. Bullock is briefly joined by some standard comedy items, like the loud, big, black woman and a mouse like assistant.Pretty boy Channing Tatum, who of course happens to have so much more layers to his personality than his looks would suggest. Got to enjoy that for literally one short scene, and it's back to the stupid pretty boy. The PC way to go. Even guys aren't allowed to be pretty and stupid anymore.Daniel Radcliff, once again as this spoiled, rich, frustrated, inferiority complex ridden A-hole, like he played in ""Now You See Me 2"". Done before and absolutely not an improvement, or in any way interesting. Joined by some stereotypical henchmen. Buffed and brainless, adding nothing.One lame joke after another. All been done before in just about any adventure movie ever. And worst of all, the utterly failing attempt at some clever Gilmore Girls like dialogue, that more or less dies a horrible death after the second line. Guess the screenwriters got most of their material off the internet, or were hired fresh out of a Craigslist Comedy writing 101 class.The only funny part in the entire movie was Brad Pitt, but that didn't last long.In short, another failed Hollywood attempt to relive the good old years, where writers still came up with original ideas.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The whole film seems like a cheap copy of the least-good of the Indiana Jones movies. I'm done with watching any movie with Sandra Bullock in it, because she can't act to save her life.In the first part of the film she swans about in a low-cut jump suit that is obviously taped to her skin with double-sided tape.What has she done to her face? I'm shocked. Her nose looks as if someone took a craft knife to it, and her upper lip is weird. Sorry, but I would rather watch someone who's not been butchered by plastic surgeons and shot up with Botox injections.The film itself is just an excuse to prance about in a remarkably well-manicured ""jungle"" and is really a pastiche of every similar film you've seen.Bullock plays Loretta Sage, an adventure novelist with a strong romance element.

This is obviously a rehash of Romancing the Stone and a bad one at that.2. Ther character development was seriously underdeveloped. Sandra's character was completely unsympathetic and pretty unlikable. Channing's character was bit of an idiot and never proved to be different.3. There was no chemistry between the 2 main characters.3. The ""jokes"" weren't all that funny. They seemed to try a little to hard.4. To me, a long time romance reader, it kind of felt like the movie was making fun of me and others who love the genre.5. Against all odds, I just don't see the appeal of Channing Tatum. I feel like this movie would've been better if they had cast another actor in his role. (Maybe Keanu Reeves since they already have shown that those 2 have terrific chemistry.)
The only thing that was good about this movie was getting to see Daniel Radcliffe be the villain and even that was not as developed as it could've been. I know hollywood could've done better than this.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

That's about all the positive about the movie.With a dearth of good adventure movies in last few years, when a movie with an enticing title for any avid connoisseur like ""The Lost City"" comes along, the anticipation is high, especially with actors like Sandra, Daniel Radcliffe and Brad Pitt. Oh, and Channing Tatum. But this one falls flat on almost every aspect.Lack of a menacing antagonist, who is never really a threat is just one of the many things which go wrong here. Background score is aridly unoriginal. You never quite feel the sense of urgency or ""adventure"" like you do in trendsetters like The Mummy franchise.The banter between the characters is more like a conversation between tweens. Dialogues directed towards the working class people in the movie are more scornful than anything else.Acting here is subpar at best. Actors feel bored with no real chemistry.Story line is predictable. No serious attempt to make the treasure hunt even a little cerebral. Even the twists in the tale are visible from a 100 miles away.

The interpretations of both Sandra Bullock who played as Loretta Sage and Channing Tatum who played as Alan were hilarious and very good. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Brad Pitt's who played as Jack Trainer.

Anyway, I must say I was sleepy heading into this so I may not have watched it in the best of moods. So since the only other jungle adventure film released around the same time was Uncharted I'm going to compare them and say this was slightly better but I don't it was great. Brad Pitt was probably the best thing that happened but his character only showed up for a few minutes during the movie (and post credit) so that's a little missed opportunity. Once again it's riddled with clichés but after so many films already made in the genre I guess it's hard to find something original that someone hasn't already thought about. There's the adventure side of it and the romance side of it, both were not so great, you got the typical well read, smarter character in Sandra bullock then Channing Tatum playing the good looking guy that everyone assumes is only as smart as bait but actually has more to him; and then you have the typical adventurer who's kidnapped by a rich evil man who's using her to uncover the treasure's location but is eventually saved. Both the adventure and romcom side of the movie are cliche. There are other elements added to it to give it a more unique feel but none of them deliver enough to make this an above average adventure movie. Most of the jokes didn't land but that could be due to my current drowsy state, still I don't think that changed much. It's worth a watch and something for the whole family but it's nothing special; if you do want a capering adventure film to watch, Jungle Cruise is the only recent one in memory that I enjoyed enough to recommend, that surprised me, this didn't. I am late to the party to watch The Cost City and thought I was missing out on something good and it turns out I wasn't really.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

So this movie is unique and everyone should watch it. This movie can be a complete and enjoyable study of art. Because the details are observed. Unconsciously, the director has come on the screen. A movie that can be seen a hundred times and learn a lot from it. It makes our mind more active. The movie is heavy. And it has all the features of an action movie
It's as if everything has come together to make a unique movie and everything will be engraved in the history of cinema. To make such a film, you must know literature, know classical cinema, know painting, and be a professional screenwriter. This film comes from the subconscious of its director.The story of the movie was very beautiful and not repetitive or clichéd at all. Actors seem to be made only for these roles. Adam Nei and Aron Nei prove that they can follow in the footsteps of great filmmakers. But in this movie, it is clear that they are not looking for more profit and sales with the common stereotypes of Hollywood and made an artistic and masterpiece movie with heart and soul. In short, it is very important that a movie can affect us as much as fiction.It was really a unique and first class movie. Do not be fooled by the poster. Hollywood has given us trash movies for years under the title of adventure genre, maybe we think this movie is one of them. Contrary to the simple appearance of the film, it is a masterpiece in the genre of adventure and drama. A great film, a film at the edge of the art of storytelling in cinema. Do not miss watching this movie. You will never forget the good impression this movie has on you.....","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

As for Sandra Bullock she appears to have been making pretty much the same film her entire career. Without being disrespectful she's getting a bit long in the tooth for these roles. I really hope she gave the soft focus lense guy a healthy tip for his work on this fiasco.

Even the backstory about her dead husband made no meaning to the story.If you are going to make an action adventure like Romancing The Stone or Indiana Jones you have to focus on1. Chemistry in the acting. There was none at all except from a short cameo from Brad Pitt. Tatum and Bullock both phoned in this performance and I honestly can't blame them due to the state of the script.2. Create a good and believable villain. Daniel Radcliffe did not pull this one of at all. Also him being a famous person from a famous family made no sense3. Focus on action and adventure. This movie focused more on dull dialogue instead of pacing it up with some good action scenes. Every time something happened the movie stopped so Bullock and Tatum could talk about irrelevant stuff for 5 mins.Avoid this movie at all costs and rewatch Romancing The Stone, The Mummy or Indiana Jones instead.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It just didn't. There needs to be a believable relationship with some chemistry on screen, there wasn't. This felt like a film where the actors just went through the motions and took the pay, did they not realise how bad it was or did they not care. Daniel Radcliffe seemed miscast as a strange baddie and he didn't portray any believable threat or nastiness that you might expect. It looks like Brad Pitt had a fun time in his role but Sandra Bullock (looking a bit weird and a lot less like Sandra Bullock of 10 years ago) just felt completely flat and disinterested, low key acting to the extreme. Channing Tatum played a body obsessed half wit much of the time, but maybe showing a lot of flesh was meant to draw women to the cinema. The plot was just complete nonsense. The potential was there for this to be an entertaining film but they blew it. Interesting to note that Sandra Bullock was one of the producers, maybe she should have spotted that this was a turkey early on and done something about it. Maybe it was just a case of a film being written by committee with them trying to hit all the usual scenes expected in a loosely rom-com adventure genre, sadly it was well wide of the mark.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The comedy was also not funny; at the start I guess the awkward moment jokes and fumbling to communicate was funny, but the same type of lame jokes again and again. I'm surprised how Sandra Bullock and Daniel Radcliff agreed to do this. The dialogues were so messy, and the romance between the leads was lackluster and seemed extremely forced. Also Loretta having a good look of Alan's d*** when he only asked her to look for leaches and then developing feelings for him... what kind of stupid message are they giving?This was a total let down...

I absolutely love Brad Port's short but remarkable presentation, which amusingly contrasts with his serious appearance.

Sandra Bullock, also accidentally discovering her comedic potential, depicts a self-centered intellect who slowly learns to let go of her trauma and hubris, and appreciate her loved ones. Besides these, the film barely reaches the bar. Channing and Sandra's chemistry is apparent but not convincing. Moreover, Alan's immature and guileless characteristic is somehow added with a sudden canniness towards life, which is just contradicting. Lastly, the plot is just plain - several times the film sprinkle Beth's completely unrelated solo slapsticks for the sake of time, and I am routinely distracted by sleepiness.

Daniel Radcliffe actually makes a fantastic villain in this movie with some really funny dialogue.Overall, the movie has plenty of funny bits despite having some jokes that fall flat and the movie occasionally gets dull during the first half before it starts to pick up during the second half. The movie benefits from some really good casting decisions and Bullock's usual deadpan delivery feels balanced against Tatum and Daniel Radcliffe's over-the-top quirky personas. Bullock portrays a jungle romance writer who's lost all passion for writing romance books but when she gets entangled in a jungle adventure of her own, she regains her lust for writing as well as romance. Despite the majority of the film containing over-the-top comedy, there are some serious moments where Bullock and Tatum's characters are fleshed out. Overall, there's a fair amount of drama mixed in with the film's comedy.Reportedly, this is going to be Bullock's last film for a while as she's planning to take an extended break from acting in Hollywood so I really recommend this film if you're a fan of Sandra Bullock and rom-coms in general.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

There are some parts that could have really used some editing.The ugly - most of the secondary characters are a why.

It's very much family comedy meaning it applies broadly but isn't spectacular for any group in particular.Daniel Radcliffe is straight up terrible as the villain. There simply is no fit here at all. He isn't funny, nor can he really be taken very seriously. It seems uncertain he will ever be able to break from his role as Harry Potter.

I love a Romcom, but why not add some adventure right? You might think so. The problem with mixing 3 genres is the balance, and at least one part suffering. The Lost City sounds good on paper... I mean, it has Bullock and Tatum... hell yeah, it even got Pitt. But when the supporting cast makes me laugh even more, than these 3 names... clearly something is off! Jokes are not landing, there is a lot of chemistry missing between Bullock/Tatum, the storyline is very predictable... I felt even awkward at some points, for sure the scene where Tatum clearly need to show off his body. Obviously a point in his contract, but the build-in how to do it, is rather lame and it just feels off. I often watch the end credits and see 4 script writers for a bunch of nonsense like this? Why??? Even the adventure part is pretty lame (a small little temple in front of a massive blown up CGI forrest) and some tomb. Where are the lush sets? The dangerous booby traps? The plot twists? I mean, nevertheless I enjoyed myself slightly during the movie. You know you can't expect much, going into this... but all was very frustrating and it could've been much more, and opened a new era in this kind of niche genre. I'm even surprised it scored more than 6/10 on imdb. I hardly can give it a 5.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Towards the end the heroine jumped in the water to escape from the lava wearing her shoes. That only explains how much care they have given while making the film.

There wasn't much comedy in the movie; just some lame jokes here and there.

I suppose, since some of it is so obvious, there might have been some thought of playing off of those two for fun, but it does not work. I did laugh once early on, though I can't remember why the very next day and there is absolutely no realistic drama, thrills or suspense at any point, if any were intended. Hard to tell. Read here that Ryan Reynolds was sought for the male lead. That was a loss for us, though perhaps a gain for him. To be kind, I'll just say that Tatum displays a great body which seems to be his sole contribution, though also to be kind, the role is terribly written. Bullock also displays, with more (ridiculous) clothing, that she too is in great shape, but she is back in her generic comic mode and if you haven't tired of this schtick yet, perhaps you will like her. She does have comic talent, but she too needs a script that is not embarassing. Brad Pitt makes a cameo and is by far the best thing about this film. The less said about the usually reliable Daniel Radcliffe the better. The ending is positively skin-crawlingly awful.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

She's one damn gorgeous woman with a wide range of acting abilities and I found her to be charming as ever. Channing Tatum looks so young, he makes me feel old. He's 41-year-old for the love of God. When The Lost City poster and trailer were released, it only took these two world renowned actors to catch my attention and I was immediately sold.The Lost City is marketed as an action rom-com with a bit of spoofy elements so it's inevitable for audience to go in expecting it to be a comedy film. Did the comedy work? Yes and no. Some of them were effectively done, it received lots of gags from everyone but others were okay at best, mostly because of 2 reasons; either the trailer has spoilt what could have exploded the hall with laughter or it's just not funny enough to warrant a giggling response from the audience.Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum have a great chemistry and they are just adorable together. Albeit Bullock is 16 years older than Tatum, she knew how to act younger despite her character who leads a simple, boring and uninspired life. Tatum portrays a capable-looking bloke only to realize that he's not as strong as how people see him. Throughout, it felt like their characters are almost caricature-like, which was what elevated the chemistry for me.Daniel Radcliffe is mehhh, he played the exact similar to his previous blockbuster role, Now You See Me 2 but I guess that's what made it funny, the fact that this movie just straight out let him played a similar role again which was kinda spoofy. Brad Pitt is charismatic as always although I knew his character only serves a few purposes for the movie.Is it filled with action-packed? No, not really. Here's the thing about The Lost City, it spends most of their running time talking and elaborating its comedic scenes which are a hit-or-miss, that they sometimes forget to include 'action' in it. And even when there's one, it's mostly consisted of chasing sequences that are okay at best, and there's barely any action going on expect when Brad Pitt's in it.Ironically, The Lost City is... lost within its own world. It fails to set a tone that enriches the world, resulting in a blockbuster movie that feels cheap and half-cooked. It doesn't look appealing to the point that it takes away what could have potentially be an enjoyable experience like Jumanji or Indiana Jones. Even for a semi-spoof film, it's bad considering it took about $70 million budget to make this.Verdict: The Lost City sends a pair of attractive leads capable enough of surviving to the jungle. However, the deeper the journey, the more they realize it has lost its charm, resulting in a mundane expedition.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

She gets kidnapped by a billionaire Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe) who needs her to help locate The Lost City and the treasure within. Alan (Channing Tatum), who Loretta uses as a cover model on the covers of her books decides to be a hero and rescue her. Alan uses his meditation guru Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt) to help.This is a disappointing Rom Com bordering on being annoying. Everything was forced. The only funny thing was when trying to get out of the jungle, Loretta, says, ""I'll drive"" and as she touches the car, it falls over the cliff. That was it. Yes, funny but was shown many times in the promos so we knew what would happen. Still it was funny. The script was okay, the execution of that script was lacking. Poor dialogues by others and incessant banter by Allen made no sense whatsoever. Like I said everything was disappointing.The only bright spot in here was the performance of Brad Pitt as Jack Trainer. All went downhill after his scenes were done. Okay, okay, Daniel Radcliffe did okay with what he had to deal with. Sandra Bullock as Loretta, who Is the Kidnappee wasn't given memorable lines (and it's her show, bummer)Notables: Patti Harrison as Alison, Loretta's Media Manager; Brad Pitt as Jack Trainer a Navy Seal turned CIA Agent and Trainer's scenes were spot on. DaVine Jay Randolph as Beth, Loretta's editor who finds a way to track Loretta down in that faraway jungle.I expected better from Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum. For what it's worth, they should never attempt comedy again. They are not good at it. Okay, maybe the script was at fault too. (3/10)Violence: Yes

The plot line has been done before, time and time again. I mean, it's been years since I've seen Romancing the Stone but as I recall it's basically the same story line. The climax scene I'm pretty sure they just took from the Goonies, although not done nearly as well.The scenes that are meant to be comedic are really not that funny. I didn't have one point in the movie that I actually laughed. Maybe a little snicker at one scene but that's about it. Even the adventure aspect of it wasn't original or very adventurous.

No clues about an existing property it was attached to, no comic book characters or Oscar bait material..... how did it get the green light from the studio? City felt very old fashioned and with some interesting names in the cast, I was intrigued. Starting with the plot and characters, Lost City doesn't rewrite the book on this genre of movie but it avoids too many of the tropes. It's helped along by the fact that it's such an oddity in 2022. I was disarmed by the story's earnestness and straightforward nature. The screenwriters could have wrote a tighter plot but the phrase ""good enough"" comes to mind. It was never intolerable or grating and while Loretta being a stick in the mud could have been too familiar or Alan being a useless idiot could have been too easy, I found the movie was able to toe the line without being too lazy or cliche. The story and characters get the job done (with the exception of Allison whose jokes consistently elicited no laughs).Sandra Bullock has been bouncing around, hopping between genres and projects to varying degrees of success. She's a versatile actress but The Lost City feels like a throwback to her days doing movies like The Proposal and Miss Congeniality. Regardless of what you think of those movies, she's one of the few who could pull those roles off consistently and she's more than game here as over-the-hill writer Loretta. She doesn't play it up too hard, she walks a fine line between capably anchoring the movie yet being game to roll with Tatum or whomever she's sharing the screen with. Tatum's re-invention as a comedian has been such a joy to witness. He's got serious comic chops and he has great chemistry with Bullock. The two of them together had me chuckling throughout. Brad Pitt was great in his role, he's on exactly the same wavelength he needs to be and while I knew he was capable of being funny, I was surprised at how deftly he played his character. I always like seeing Daniel Radcliffe pop up in things, he's got a very diverse portfolio of characters and he always seems to be throwing his all into it. He's a lot of fun here, I did have a couple of notes on his character but his performance always had the requisite energy and spirit. Da'Vine Joy Randolph was also a welcome addition, she walks a similar line to Bullock and she never failed to deliver her punchlines in a way that didn't leave a smile on my face.I could pick this movie apart if I really wanted to. The script could have been stronger, there are extra scenes that don't really gel with the overall narrative, the movie can't make up its mind on how villainous they want Fairfax to be. But despite the flaws, I didn't want to penalize The Lost City too heavily with for its missteps. As I mentioned above, I was taken aback by The Lost City. Not every joke lands, not every narrative decision plays but the movie works more often than it doesn't and it didn't dampen my enthusiasm as the film went along.The Lost City made for a refreshing viewing experience. The mid-size movie is fading into obscurity and while most of us love the huge tentpoles or the obscure indie fare, I'm glad there's still an audience that's willing to go out for this kind of romp. Bullock and Tatum are on point, the story has enough laughs and heart baked in to keep you interested and there's plenty of fun to be had (it's not completely family friendly as there were some kids in my theatre that witnessed some pretty ""adult"" jokes). It won't make any top 10 lists but The Lost City adds up to a couple of well spent hours at the theatre. If you're tired of superheroes and weepy dramas, give this a shot and maybe you'll exit the cinema pleasantly surprised like I did.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

IMO, they have a more natural rom-com chemistry. The rest of the supporting cast is standard: Daniel Radcliffe looks like he had fun playing a bad guy role and Oscar Nuñez (same-named character from The Office) is funny in his minor role.This film misses the mark yet it still has some entertainment value.

The film drags it's not much of a comedy. I don't Understand why the critics gave it a good review. I recommend the original romancing the stone to watch. Sandra Channing and Daniel and Brad are all ok but the script is so boring. I don't understand why the critics liked this film.

The trailer and promotion did not ruin anything, I'm glad I watched it at the cinema, it was much more fun. I was not dissapointed at all, laughed a lot and it exceeded my expectations.Yes, it may seem silly at times or even predictable, but it still surprises you.

Because it is not only a revival of the genre, but also a new kind of filmmaking based on its classic components. Basically, I think the big problem for great filmmakers is that they don't watch movies correctly!!!!, before they can start making their own propagandas, before they can make an alien, they can make a Terminator, they can make an avatar, or they can make a Lord of the Rings. Watch the movie of this kind ,Sit Bored 625 times (calculated number according to the main time of this movie). See this masterpiece 625 times and do not be proud. Next, if you go to build a terminator and do not have a billion-dollar audience. ......It is not possible at all. This film should be seen 625 times by any filmmaker, anyone interested in cinema in this field. In my opinion, watching this film 625 times is obligatory for any filmmaker and filmwatcher in this genre (or a film of this power).","8 out of 23 found this helpful.

But still, despite my wavering hopes about the story itself, the hilarious trailer and charming leads kept my expectations far above average.After a rough first 30 minutes it was much appreciated once Bullock and Tatum finally arrived in the jungle along with a hilarious Brad Pitt in a very welcome yet minuscule role. During this short part of the film while our protagonists are accustoming themselves with the jungle every slightly funny scene is HILARIOUS with multiple sequences where the whole cinema was roaring in laughter!Unfortunately not soon after, directors Adam and Aaron Nee lose all of their steam , swapping belly laughs with little to no light grins. It is tiring to see predictable plots unfold and unfunny jokes being made along with flimsy CGI and an utterly underwhelming ending.Brad Pitt is the star of the show while both Tatum and Bullock get the job done. A miscast Daniel Radcliff plays villain 'Abigail Fairfax', a both cliche and uninteresting antagonist. Meanwhile Da'Vine Joy Randolph is a delightful surprise with a likable persona and an amusing sub-plot.At the end of the day The Lost City is not a TERRIBLE movie, it has it's moments and surprisingly deep characters to route for. Despite it's major problems The Lost City is still enjoyable and will pass the time ...but don't expect to be blown away!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Shes not funny or charismatic all she does is talk about her book and complain. When Brad Pitt came in the movie got way better but spoilers he dies and its back to Sandra and Channing. Channing Tatum was funny in this movie but he needs someone funnier than him to bounce off him and Sandra is not that. If you replaced Sandra with Patti Harrison who stole the show in her minor appearance then this movie would work! She is hilarious! The movie is shot very well and has some cool action but its not enough. Also i already saw Danielle Radcliffe do this same exact role and performance in Now You See Me 2. Just a poorly casted movie. You can turn your brain off and have a fun time with this movie but you have to cast a good lead.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The beautiful island landscape where the movie is set is its biggest pro. Sandra Bullock's fun free style performance supported by Channing Tatum and Daniel Radcliffe adds to the entertainment of the movie. The colorful action sequences serve their purpose of making this flick watchable. Climax is another thing that saved this one from more problems by delivering a satisfying end. Last but not the least Brad Pitt steals the show with his role 😁.However, none of the jokes seem to land for me, the B grade sequence is the worst part of the movie that ruined the experience for me. Prolonged dance sequence is another dull factor of the movie.

So while this is a mildly amusing action adventure romp that moves along at a brisk pace I wasn't totally swept along by the premise like I was with Robert Zemeckis' movie and I think this was due to some of the casting.Sandra Bullock is excellent as romantic novelist Loretta Sage who gets caught up in a kidnapping after promoting her latest book and finds herself on a remote island in the jungle in the middle of nowhere with her cover model Channing Tatum in tow. Thinking that Loretta has insider knowledge about a lost ancient city which features in her fictional novel, a billionaire tries to get her to solve the whereabouts of the real ancient city so he can get his hands on the hidden treasure.It's a nice idea but is sadly let down by the casting of Tatum who may have the looks and physique but doesn't possess the required charisma or on screen chemistry with his female lead to pull it off like Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner did in both Romancing the Stone movies. I get that the filmmakers are trying to flip the strong macho male lead cliche by making Bullock's character the stronger braver one which is a nice touch and obviously sits better with a modern audience, but the whole premise hinges on the relationship between the two leads which for me just doesn't work. You feel that the filmmakers are just going through the motions trying to channel their inner Indiana Jones rather than come up with something new.The other mistake was casting Daniel Radcliffe as billionaire Abigail Fairfax who I found to be totally unconvincing. He seems too young to be the villain and shows little menace as the unscrupulous kidnapper hell bent on getting his hands on the treasure. The films saving grace though comes in the form of Brad Pitt who, although only having a brief appearance as CIA operative Jack Trainer, steals the scenes he's in which makes you realise Channing Tatum's shortcomings.The Lost City delivers some thrills and escapism, and it's fun to see Bullock stranded in the jungle wearing a totally inappropriate pink sequined jumpsuit which adds to the ill equipped 'fish out of water' scenario she finds herself in, but the romance doesn't work, the comedy often falls flat and it's about half an hour too long.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

With her streak of strong performances, I was then looking forward to her next outing. In The Lost City however, Bullock disappointingly regresses to her typical klutz of a character, a role we've seen a thousand times that its reemergence was chore to endure. Channing Tatum does not escape his own typecast, as the film's dialogue relied heavily on his idiocy to spark comedy, which failed miserably in my books. Further bogged down by an an atrocious screenplay that presented unoriginal & boring physical comedy, chemistry that felt forced & unappealing, the result is then romantic comedy that comes up bland, awkward & cringe worthy. Oh, and the green screen sticks out like a sore thumb too FYI.Overall, The Lost City failed on everything it tries to be. It presents itself as rom-com, yet good ol' laughter was a rarity. It declares itself as adventure-fueled, yet motivations & dangers were shallow, and technically, the film screams falsity.

The movie seemed poised to deliver an engaging story. Unfortunately, it devolved into a hodgepodge of poor writing and illogical drama. One glaring inconsistency was the portrayal of a billionaire riding in a makeshift ambulance, being chased down by an unarmed, average individual. Even more baffling was that this supposed billionaire had only a single gun for protection, undermining the sense of danger and urgency.The romantic subplot felt forced and uninspired, detracting from the film's overall impact. One of the most perplexing moments involved the lead actress inexplicably turning down an incredible opportunity to recover a lost, valuable item. This choice not only lacked motive but also severed any connection I had with her character.Lastly, the film was rife with numerous smaller loopholes that were hard to overlook. For instance, a character struggled to open a simple plastic clip while, oddly enough, carrying a chair throughout a chase scene. These issues collectively shattered my suspension of disbelief, leaving me to lament what could have been a much more compelling cinematic experience.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In fact, that's what kept me from sleeping while watching this movie. The most boring two hours I spent on a theather, and I watched ""The Eternals"" recently.I already knew that The Lost City was the kind of movie where you turn your brain off and have fun; the problem is, even if I rip the brain out of my head, I still wouldn't enjoy this movie. The beginning is very promising, it establishes the tone of the film, introduces characters, situations, and context in a pretty good way, but towards the half of the runtime, the story starts to get stuck, and it just doesn't turn into a very expensive sleeping pill because Channing Tatum and Sandra Bullock are really good in here.The story is way more interested in the silly adventure, but sometimes it tries to invest in an uninteresting drama just to put the main couple together. Booooring. I could easily cut off 40 minutes of this movie. Even things that should get more attention, like action scenes, visual effects and production design are really bad.Anyway, if you like to see Brad Pitt being hot, this movie may suit you (even if he only appears for about 10 minutes). Otherwise, a totally forgettable adventure. The Rock loves to make movies in the jungle, maybe if he were here, the film would be a little less boring.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is kind of ironic, since Stone was frequently charged with ripping off Raiders of the Lost Ark, an accusation with which, I've never agreed and don't think is in any way sustainable.At any rate believe me when I say the list of plot similarities between LC and RTS is pretty staggering, right down to the mid movie outdoor dance scenes, where both leads finally acknowledge the physical attractions they hold with each other. I won't bore you with a list of parallels. Suffice to say that billed as LC is, an action - adventure romantic comedy, RTS tops it in all those key areas. 38 years later, it still has better action scenes, more suspense, a greater sense of fun and a much higher - charged chemistry between leads Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas, than LC could ever hope to achieve.There are positives. The Lost City, like the somewhat similar (and disappointing) Jungle Cruise, is pretty harmless, in an almost bland, family - friendly way. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum utilise the right approach to the material on offer and never play over - seriously. The Brad Pitt and Stephen Lang cameos are welcome and Pitt especially has a lot of fun with his part as a gruff soldier of fortune with a contemplative side, (though I have no idea why his role was made so obvious in the trailers. Well actually I do. Regrettably, it was probably all about money). Da'Vine Joy Randolph playing the over - stressed literary agent Beth, pretty much steals the show. She serves up the best lines and is involved in the funniest scenes, most noteworthy of which co - star a very sociable goat.It's just a pity that the general involvement factor of the movie wasn't ratcheted up a lot more tightly. There seriously is minimalist action and what there is, is choreographed quite poorly. The dialogue is repetitious and there is too much of Loretta (Bullock) and Alan (Tatum) endlessly walking through the jungle just talking away. In fact head villain, Daniel Radcliffe (playing it completely for laughs) disappears off screen for such long periods, we almost forget about him and any threats or dangers he may pose to the welfare of our supposed heroes.I much as anyone likes a good adventure come romance yarn, but sadly The Lost City, whilst innocent enough, just doesn't cut the mustard for me. Believe me when I say the majority of people will be checking their watches, long before the mid - credits, half - expected twist arrives.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I guess I was too harsh for some, so I'll clean it up.The movie sucked.A popular novelist named Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) was kidnapped by a rich bad guy named Abigail Fairfax (Daniel Radcliffe). Apparently the typical rich bad guy needed Loretta to find the mcguffin.Trying to save Loretta, though he was ill-equipped mentally and otherwise, was Alan (Channing Tatum), the cover model for her romance novels. The most qualified to save her, Jack Trainer (Brad Pitt), was killed almost immediately.Through their adventure Alan proves his nobility and worthiness. Loretta drags out a joke about the size of his johnson (he had to disrobe for her to remove leeches from his lower body), and other things happen that I was supposed to laugh at.The movie was wack. Put it this way. It was so bad I left the theater to catch up on the news of Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The problem is something about Sandra Bullock's performance seemed off even awkward at times and I don't think that it was just her character. It feels like she was phoning it in and didn't particularly want to do this role or at least not with Channing Tatum. Once I found out there is a 16 year age difference between the two of them I have to figure that's what it is. I don't think she feels comfortable with him or maybe she didn't want to work with him. Everyone said she had good chemistry with Brad Pitt which she did and I think it might be because they're similar in age. There's still a pretty big age difference between her and Ryan Reynolds but I wish I hadn't heard that he was supposed to be cast because now I can't stop picturing him instead of Tatum since their chemistry in The Proposal was much better than what happened here. I do think Channing Tatum gave it his all. I also think he was much more excited to work with Sandra Bullock than the other way around. He wasn't bad either and though I love Sandra Bullock if I was going to recast her I'd probably do someone like Rachel McAdams. Again closer in age and they had good chemistry in The Vow. Plus perhaps her goofy nerdiness would have felt more genuine than Sandra Bullock's performance. Other than the off chemistry the movie is typical rom com material meets Unchartered (or yes Indiana Jones).","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

...Overall #TheLostCity gives Uncharted - meets Artemis Fowl - meets Eat, Pray, Love.The film is cute and adventurous, but it's a pretty safe film that I don't see as something worthy of spending a theater coin on in my opinion, nor rushing to see.Highlight:
First, Daniel Radcliffe was fun to watch as a villain. I also just love how effortless Sandra Bullock's comedic delivery is in this film. Additionally, the film moves quite well to keep up engagement.Could've Been Better:
Though I enjoyed Bullock's delivery, I think more thought could've been had regarding her character-her as a writer was ""aight,"" but I personally feel it wasn't the best character choice for her. I think her as an uppity, entitled actress or the book model with Tatum as the writer could've been interesting (and the story of course being focused on the book model in that context).And speaking of Tatum, his character also needed a little more time at the brainstorming table. I grew to adore him as the film progressed, but I wasn't 100% sold on him in the beginning.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

It does have its fair share of laughs but not enough to make it worth the trouble. Most of the laughs are provided by Da'Vine Joy Randolph. When Randolph is on screen, the movie's a lot of fun. When she's not, it grids to a haul. Sandra Bullock is getting to old to play these kind of characters. The rest of the cast is fine, I guess. The movie acts like everything its doing is a lot of fun but it's not. It mostly seems tired and forced. By the time ""The Lost City"" ended I couldn't care less about what was going on. Dishonorable mention: the always annoying Bowen Yang.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

But this movie proves that a great cast can only do so much with a generic story and bad writing. Maybe it's the feeling that this should have been a straight to streaming movie, or maybe it's because we've seen about 5000 movies just like this, but The Lost City was miserable to watch. The cast holds this movie up... not easily though. You can tell they're holding it up but the legs are shaking a lot. It's a generic plot that's extremely predictable and older people who don't watch many movies might swear they've seen this before. To be rewarded for a great cast though I believe you should have to do something with that cast and they don't do anything special with them here, the main characters feel like cameos in a much worst film. For that I think this film deserves an average rating, nothing worst because there are way worst films in this genre but just average. Wait for home release when it's free on something.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Determined to rescue Loretta is Alan whom is the cover model for her story; whilst Alan is a hero in Loretta's novels, can he be the real-life hero to Loretta?I've generally found Sandra Bullock to be an appealing actress; when the script is right she can sometimes have a quirky ability of making her characters likeable and turning trite material into something watchable (like Miss Congeniality 1 and 2 for example). However, The Lost City seems beyond her talents...I get that The Lost City is not meant to be taken seriously (or at least I presume that is the intention), but even so in order for a film such as The Lost City to work it needs to have certain key ingredients;CHARACTER CHEMISTRY; I've said this time and time again in my reviews and I will keep saying it when writers get this aspect wrong. I didn't think Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum worked very well as a double act. It says something that Brad Pitt managed to work up better chemistry with Sandra even though he shared much less screen time with her than Channing did; truth be told I'd have preferred it if they kept Brad and ditched Channing, but hey that's just me....THE VILLAIN; films of this nature need to have one and sadly this film was saddled with Daniel Radcliffe in this respective role. I have nothing against Daniel and have found him to be good elsewhere, but as the villain here he played sucked. His spoilt man-child act was not funny and he was about as intimidating as Mr Bean. In fact the few laughs I got from the film were from him actually trying to be tough (though I'm unsure whether this was meant to be funny or not).TENSION; well there just wasn't any and as usual Fairfax's goons were so inept that you never were in any doubt how the film would end or whether or not Alan and Loretta would get the better of them.I think what's worse is that I sensed that this was supposed to be an adventure film, but where's the mystery, the suspense, the intrigue etc and don't even get me started on the nauseating and frankly ridiculous and unbelievable romance.I found it boring and to be honest the only person I liked in this film was Brad Pitt, but he wasn't in the film enough for me to be able to truly like it.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Its punchlines are recognizable from a distance as the volcano dominating the remote island where most of the story takes place. This is a movie you can get a clear sense of from its opening moments, every beat clearly telegraphed. There is, however, a significant amount of comfort and delight in all this familiarity. Directors and co-writers Adam and Aaron Nee understand exactly what their audience wants-much like a good romance novelist might-and deliver an undeniably charming (and refreshingly IP-free) romantic romp. This is a movie you watch in the theater, with popcorn, then again and again on streaming, with a glass of wine. Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) is a burnt-out romance writer whose grief after the loss of her husband threatens to derail her career. Her disdain for her books is only matched by her dislike of their cover model, Alan (Channing Tatum), a seemingly dim beefcake who indulges her readers at signing events. After an event promoting her latest book, Loretta is abducted by explorer/rich guy Abigail (it's a gender-neutral name, apparently) Fairfax, played by Daniel Radcliffe. ""The Lost City"" may get dinged by some for being formulaic and silly, but it does many things well that are notable. It's bright, both visually and atmospherically. It's an original story, told by filmmakers who get what kind of movie this is. Most importantly, its central relationship displays a real understanding of the emotional sensitivity and vulnerability that make romance attractive as a genre. Ultimately, ""The Lost City"" is interested in hitting viewers' expectations head on. It does so on a level that may seem obvious, but is done with an amount of care that's sure to hold up to repeat viewings.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

If, however, you are expecting a fun-filled, action packed, over the top adventure/comedy/romance you will love it.Sandra Bullock is her usual comedic top class act, her physical comedy is the best, Channing Tatum is never afraid to send himself up and does so to great effect as Dash and Daniel Radcliffe makes a first class comedy bad guy with a great balance of charm and villainy.It is, to some extent, and updated Romancing The Stone, but loses nothing in that. The story really doesn't matter all that much, it's the formulaic searching for the lost treasure vibe, but all the charging around in the jungle is very funny - not least because Sandra Bullock does it all in a sequinned pink jumpsuit - kudos.Brad Pitt is hilarious - he doesn't have a big part in the movie but he makes the absolute best of what he does have - and the vibe between him and Channing is terrific.Just grab your popcorn, settle down on the sofa and have a good laugh. It's a feel-good movie with a great cast, and doesn't pretend to be anything else. I loved it.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

She never disappoints and everyone I know agrees! Channing Tatum was so, so funny - their chemistry was RIGHT ON. He has really come a long way from Mag Mike! His performance gave me the biggest laughs...really added/balanced Sandy's understandably sad character. Daniel Radcliff was equal parts awful but likable and so handsome n grown up. He was ridiculously elegant/cute as he was stupidly ineffective:) Da'Vine Joy Randolph, stunning, brilliant delivery and vulnerable-see a bright career for her, a stand out in every way!! Oscar Nunez' second movie with Sandy B and he always turns in seamlessly funny performance, The Proposal is one of my faves because of Oscar:) Brad Pitt can still rock it from A to Z, no question! The casting in the previews had me doubtful but WOW! Such a welcome and entertaining movie after the last 2.5 years! THANK YOU.I Love Sandra Bullock. I am a lifelong fan. Channing Tatum, I have also been a fan from the start. I looked forward to watching this for a while. I rarely have time to watch movies. Incredibly beautiful balance in this movie. I love these two together. So much so that I really wish true love for both of you, and that is the first time I have ever wished that for anyone. Sandra did such a remarkable impression in creating this. I loved every element that was thoughtfully felt and part of this. The entire story fits together perfectly. Sandra, thank you for giving Channing an opportunity to stand up for his talent and skills, while also embracing your femininity in a natural strong way. I had no idea this would be so good on the sophistication and kind humor, romance, and adventure. From Boulder, Colorado .. so much love and blessings to you both, the entire caste and crew. Also, I appreciate the financial investment that made this film quality in all ways. God Bless you. Kerri 10 Stars.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Kathleen Turner from Romancing the Stone and Jodie Foster from Nim's Island pop immediately to mind. So I knew I was walking into a cliche from the very start. The only question was, how are they going to breath life into it. Well, it was a team effort but they did breath life into a whole series of cliche. Or, using a more appropriate term in this case - a set of cartoons from the recluse novelist to her dim witted cover model who wants her to take him seriously. And then her overbearing literary agent; the megalomaniac millionaire with the big inferiority complex; and the list goes on. Almost everyone on screen is a walking talking cartoon of a cinematic and literary cliche. And still it does work.Recently I spoke on these pages a lot about well written roles. Well, here we had well written cliche but a superb cast headed by Sandra Bullock Channing Tatum, both of whom have already shown the ability to laugh at their own image and a surprising comic performance from Daniel Radcliffe whose acting prowess grows in leaps and bounds. All of them together, playing one of the others, make this collection of cliche work. I spoke a long while ago about Rowan Atkinson's ability of making a cartoon character human enough for us to care for him as Johnny English. Here we got a whole series of cartoons becoming real flesh and blood humans on screen - just enough for us to bond with them and care for them.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's not about the star quality. It's not about the plot. Or the setting. Or the state-of-the-art bang-bang. It's about the dialogue: hilarious and quirky. (I suggest putting the captions on, so you don't miss anything.) And the actors deliver their craft, so maybe it IS a little about star quality.Oscar Nuñez is full-blown delight . Daniel Radcliffe shows off well-aged acting chops, and Da'Vine Joy Randolph is fabulous, as always.But it's the quirky throw-away lines that make it.

"8","/10","Charming - with charismatic leads","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8204944/?ref_=tt_urv","bankofmarquis","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10919398/?ref_=tt_urv","4 June 2022","Like most folks, I barely gave THE LOST CITY any notice when it came and went in movie theaters earlier in 2022. This Sandra Bullock/Channing Tatum vehicle looked derivative from earlier films (most notably 1984's ROMANCING THE STONE with Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner) and it blew in and out of theaters with hardly a notice. But...sitting on an airplane...I ran across this flick and thought I'd give it a go.And...I'm glad I did! For THE LOST CITY is a fun, charming film with 2 charismatic lead actors that you will want to go on this adventure with.Written by Oren Uziel, Dana Fox and Adam Nee and Directed by Adam and Aaron Nee, THE LOST CITY tells the tale of Romance Novel Writer Loretta Sage (Bullock) who gets caught up in a treasure hunt when a crazed Mega-Millionaire (played with a spry twinkle in his eye by Harry Potter himself, Daniel Radcliffe) kidnaps Loretta for she had written something in her latest novel that he thinks is a clue to find the titular LOST CITY. Coming to her rescue? Her clue-less Fabio-like Cover Model (played with charming density by Channing Tatum). What could possibly go wrong?With that sort of premise, the rest of the story is fairly predictable and pedestrian, so the weight of the entertainment value of this film falls squarely on the shoulders of the charm, charisma and chemistry of the 2 leads - and the Direction of the Nee's.And...I'm surprised (and happy) to state that these all come through with flying colors making THE LOST CITY a pretty enjoyable romp.Let's start with Bullock and Tatum. They are really looking like they are enjoying themselves - and each other. Bullock is no stranger to playing emotionally repressed intellectuals and Tatum is no stranger to playing dumb lugs...and they both embrace these stereotypes and had fun brining these two to life. Add to this the aforementioned performance of Radcliffe as the comedic villain and an extended cameo from a very recognizable ""A-List"" performer - and the charm and charisma meter in this film is off the hook.The Nees, then, play to the strengths of these performers and move the film quickly from set piece to set piece, wisely only slowing down the action to let these performers play. The Directors show a light touch to this piece - and the audience is rewarded by this.Not the type of movie that will cause focus groups to sit around and discuss it after, but if you are looking for a fun romp, summer action/comedy flick to sit on the couch some summer afternoon/evening with a bowl of popcorn and your favorite beverage, look no further than THE LOST CITY.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Did this politically offend someone? Seems like a good silly comedy to me!Plenty of good things about it. Lots said about that so I won't re-hash comedy, chemistry, etc. Not everything is perfect, a few secondary characters could have been fleshed out better, have long periods in between checking in.But most of all, Daniel Radcliffe is perfect. I mean as an actor sure, but the character especially. Too many movies don't have a villain, and too many comedies make us rely on a serious villain with maybe one funny characteristic. Here, he's legit bad and... also ridiculous is exactly the same way everyone else is. He's perfect, so serves as a foil, and a threat, for the whole film.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

That's the only justify of 1/10 rating... Wtf is going on in your heads? Ridiculous, as far as I'm concerned, The Lost City wasn't advertised as deeply complex mentions of genres above, it was supposed to be fun entertaining light adventure comedy AND IT CERTAINLY DELIVERED, period.Rate the movie by it's genre please, good comedy should give you great time, lighten up the mood and give a good laugh, good horror should chill your spine, good drama should definitelly spice your eyes unless your emotionless stone. I can't even remind of myself when was the last time I had such a great time in terms of laughter and good time, Bad boys for life possibly?Highly recommended movie, 2 hours off the gray abominable view of the outside which is real life, once for a week to month you just gotta blow off some steam and watch something cheering up, not dramas and horrors all the time ffs, let's be human. Amazing movie, especially nowadays with insanely flat low tier ocean of movies with just ""woke press"" and terrible humour draining your remaining braincells.Excellent job, thank you,Final conclusion : 9/10, movies like these are rare gems these days, you will appreciate it one day or another. Good comedy isn't easy to obtain sadly, there will be always a viewer target with too high iq, too low iq, different taste of humour and sensitivity, you can't please them all....","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

This is a great movie for the Gen x and the early Millennial generation. It's fun, well acted with an exciting storyline and some tongue in cheek moments.It reminds me of movies made before the critics demanded a social justice message, back when entertainment was just entertainment.I loved the cast, Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum worked so well together. They were sexy, intelligent, funny, and it really felt like there was chemistry between them.The action scenes were fun, yet suited a younger audience. The ending was gripping, fulfilling and had a lovely romantic overtone.I don't understand why this seems to have been rated so low. Yeah, it doesn't have an LGBT element, yeah, it doesn't address real life struggles, but... it doesn't have to.Both sexes are held in high regard, both male and female have equally heroic parts to play. In my eyes, this movie was just as good as Romancing the Stone or Indiana Jones.I would have given this 8/10 but I'm giving it 10/10 because I truly believe this movie has been hard done by by the critics... you don't get to the top 10 Netflix list unless you're popular with the public, and what's the point of a critics score unless it's to mirror what the public wants.The ENTIRE point of a critic, is to give the public a leading edge on what's good... but if the critics are out of touch with what the public want, perhaps it's time we bin them as the gods who choose what should go onto the pedestals of greatness.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Simply a romantic comedy, like the ones in old times + modern trends (technology + new age stuff which served well for character development) . A little bit silly, but not overly stupid (ekhm, anyone seen ""Love and Thunder""?....) to the point of unwatchable. The movie was just like classic romantic comedies, very silly but funny and light. There was absolutely NOTHING cringy in this movie in a bad way, which again should be standard for all movies but sadly is hard to come by nowadays. Daniel Radcliffe made such a good villain, I think he was cast perfectly for this role and Im happy for him that he is trying out his skills in different genres as different characters, good for him. He did a great job! Overall, all actors were great. Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum was not a combination Id ever consider but they had such great chemistry throughout the movie! Alan was very likable and charming and relatable. Beth was awesome and very likable, I wish she had more time for development, would love to know more of her story!Overall, I was very pleased with this movie. A perfect balance of humor, romance, and fantasy. The creators of this movie have proven that it IS possible to create a neutral movie for the purpose of enjoyment and entertainment solely, and they proven that romantic comedy is not dead and a modern spin on it makes for an easy and enjoable movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is the kind of old-fashioned movie silliness that you so rarely find anymore; it's unrealistic and completely over the top and all the better for it. The aforementioned leads are both fantastic in their roles; funny, charming and both bring some great physical comedy that alone had me in stitches. The story itself is pretty basic, but that feels like it's by design. It's a comedy adventure romp and in that it definitely succeeds.If you remember how to sit back and enjoy a silly, funny popcorn flick you'll probably enjoy it. I did!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was funny, the scripting was good, acting was spectacular, it was witty, there was action ect.This had Sandra bullock, Channing Tatum, Daniel Radcliffe and Brad Pitt. I've seen a lot is Sandra's movies and I already love her work so I'm slightly bias about any movie of her's I watch, but I haven't really watched anything of Channing Tatum's, but in this he smashed his role. He was so funny and played his part really well. The chemistry between Sandra and Channing, worked wonders for the relationship between their characters, Loretta and Alan.The whole cast are fantastic! It definitely didn't fail to put a smile on my face. I watched it again with my family and enjoyed their laughs.There are sweet moments between Loretta and Alan, that really brought it all together.

It's a silly, romcom that fits the bill for how it is being marketed.Brad Pitt really does play a great character & it would have been nice if he had more scenes. His character is such a badass, but that's simply not how the story was written. As for the others: Sandra is great as Loretta - simply a classic Sandra Bullock character. She's uptight but lovable, a little snobby but deep down still humble & she's just silly enough to make it all work, Da'Vine Joy Randolph's performance as Beth is phenomenal, as is Loretta's social media asst Allison, played by Patti Harrison. I should also add the Daniel Radcliffe does a great job (of course) w his character, even though it's almost odd to see him as a bad guy. These are well cast, albeit silly characters & it 'works'.This movie is not anything worthy of huge praise, awards or anything of that nature. It's just a fun, silly film, basically just being exactly what it says it will be - a silly adventure romcom taking place in a rather unique environment (which really is beautiful, BTW).I don't know when everyone became such full-blown critics of every show & movie out there but had this been 10 years ago, at least 75% of these negative reviews would have been people who either didn't watch the movie, didn't bother to take their frustrations out on some IMDb review page, or just watched, shrugged it off & moved on. But these days everyone feels the need to complain about something, so take those reviews for what they're worth - people just want to criticize others constantly & everyone seems to think they are the next Steven Spielberg when half of the US (the world, maybe?) are just a bunch of frustrated, know at alls who really should not be writing reviews at all. :-)I'm really not here to complain about the reviewers though, just trying to give the movie a fair review by pointing out that those who had the worst things to say tend to give one star on nearly EVERY review they post. These individuals only pop in here to diss films, so maybe don't take THEM too seriously :-)Bottom line? I'd say just a ignore those negative peeps (remember, they give everything 1 star) in stride & give this fun flick a chance - I think most people will enjoy it.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's great that the pilot is from Sandra's movie proposal. He is an excellent character, and I hope he is in many many more movies, cause he alone is HILARIOUS! The 'work' Sandra had on he face is very distracting in this movie. She looks like she has some Botox, and lip injections, hee upper lip is ...well it is making her look weird. Also, the line about her being geriatric, I think was a bit much to assume someone her age is Geriatric! The one thing I find weird is when she has an opportunity to get dressed into something more 'appropriate for her environment she wears a dress? It's a great story line, except it's missing .... Around Sandra's character... maybe more comedy.... I can't put my finger on it. I really like Sandra bullock as an actress, comedian... up there as one of my favourites. She has Betty White timing, and I think she's kind to her fans. Something she may have learned from Betty, as Betty loved her. I hope she does more movies like this and more with Melissa, in heat. Together they are freakn hilarious! Her manager who is trying to find her is a great part of this movie, since all her pit falls are usually what happens. No one wants to just help anyone anymore, so no one makes it easy for her. I also wonder if the falls really exists in the Dominican where this was filmed. I hope there is a part two to this movie. Enjoy this movie, cause WE all did!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Uncharted and Red Notice to name a few. I literally gave up hope on finding a solid movie in this genre released after 2020. But tonight I finally gave in and thought, why not try this movie?I mean it's Sandra Bullock. She has a loooooong trail of phenomenal movies made. The only movie I could think of that was disappointing in her trail was Miss Congeniality 2. But let's pretend that never happened.This movie was what other movies of it's kind attempted but could not do! It's funny! My husband and I genuinely laughed out loud! I can't tell you the last time a recently released movie made us do that!The character development and back stories were well done! What really did it for us was the characters themselves. They were so layered. They had heart!Even the cheesy parts of this movie was well earned. Not out of place. Cringey but in a way that added to the story.I really enjoyed this movie. I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again. But it put a great smile on my face and warmed my heart. It gave me hope for movies yet to be released. So it gets a 10/10 because it went above and beyond movies of it's kind that were recently released.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It is an honest c o m e d y, something to laugh at while sipping a wine alone or with friends, and it leaves a positive aftertaste.The film has a vibe of similar comedies from early 2000s, it even felt somehow like an older film, made in the new contemporary setting.The conversations between characters are enjoyably funny, and I thought that whoever wrote them was good.While I had no expectations, the film pleasantly surprised me, and actually made me laugh.Also, Sandra Bullock and Da'Vine Joy Randolph are gorgeous.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This reminded me of romancing the stone movie but with lots more humor. She's a romance novelist who lives out her adventure unknowingly very similar to Romancing the Stone .

It was awesome to see some familiar faces on the screen, some who we grew up with. It made my cold day in Toronto a little warmer.Would recommend for those looking for an escape from life!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I expected to look on this page and see people panning it. Where is the comedy? What action? I thought that Sandra Bullock could act but that proved to be untrue. Not high expectations for Channing Tatum but actually he has comic timing, he just had a God awful lame script. Seriously I can't believe that there are people on here giving this a score of 10 who thought it was hysterical and that there was chemistry between the leads. I found myself double checking that I had the right movie! I resented giving this pile even one star but perhaps it was worth that for casting Harry Potter as a bad guy.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Setting: 7/10This movie was barely watchable. It wasn't self aware which was the whole point of the premise and would have elevated the film. This movie follows Loretta Stone, a sad, depressed woman who wants to kill off her main male character because she doesn't get along with the vapid air headed cover model played by Tatum. She very randomly and abruptly ends up on an island adventure with tatum where they fall into cliche tropes, but they aren't self aware or sexy or romantic. It's stupidly awkward and uncomfortable due to the lack of chemistry between the characters. This is a major flaw because nothing gets built and the whole movie had no payoff- except an awkward kiss and mismatched banter at the end.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.
