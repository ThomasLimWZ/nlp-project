"6","/10","A Remake of a Film that Never Needed to be Remade","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0956979/?ref_=tt_urv","JamesHitchcock","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2955724/?ref_=tt_urv","3 November 2004","If one wants to remake a movie, the best option is probably to choose and original that was good, but not a great classic. Clearly, any attempt to remake a concept that failed first time around is fraught with danger, but an attempt to remake a classic runs the risk that one's film will be unfavourably compared with the original. The original 1968 film of 'Planet of the Apes' is one of cinema's great science fiction classics. More than an adventure story, it touches on some of the concerns of the late sixties- the fear of nuclear war, race relations- and also raises more fundamental issues about the relationship between man and nature, the relationship between religion and science, Darwinism and animal rights. It was therefore a brave move on Tim Burton's part to try and remake it. The main concept of Tim Burton's film is basically similar to Franklin Schaffner's. An astronaut from Earth travels to a planet ruled by intelligent apes. Humans exist on this planet, but they are regarded as an inferior species, despised and exploited by the apes. There is, however, an important difference. In the original film, the apes are the only intelligent and articulate beings on the planet. Although they have only attained a pre-industrial level of civilization (they have firearms, but no power-driven machinery, and no means of transport other than the horse or horse-drawn vehicles), they are a far more advanced species than the planet's human inhabitants, who lack the powers of speech and reason and live an animal-like existence. In Burton's remake, humans and apes have similar powers of speech and intellect; it is only the apes' greater physical strength that enables them to dominate the planet and to treat the humans as slaves. It was this ironic role-reversal, with apes behaving like men and men behaving like beasts, that gave Schaffner's film its satirical power. That film was advertised with the slogan 'Somewhere in the Universe, there must be something better than man!', and the apes are indeed, in some respects, better than man. Their law against killing others of their kind, for example, is much more strictly observed than our commandment that 'Thou shalt do no murder'. There is no sense that the apes are bad and the humans good. Even Dr Zaius, the orang-utan politician, is not a wicked individual; by the standards of his society he is an honourable and decent one. His weakness is that of excessive intellectual conservatism and unwillingness to accept opinions that do not fit in with his preconceived world view. (In this respect the apes are very human indeed). Burton's film takes a less subtle moral line. It is a straightforward story of a fight for freedom. The villains are most of the apes, especially the fanatical, human-hating General Thade. The heroes are Captain Davidson, the astronaut from Earth, the planet's human population who long for freedom from the domination of the apes, and a few liberal, pro-human apes, especially Ari, the daughter of an ape senator. The apes are more aggressive and more obviously animals than in the original film; they still frequently move on all fours and emit fierce shrieks whenever angry or excited. There are some things about this film that are good, especially the ape make-up which is, for the most part, more convincing than in the original film and allows the actors more scope to show emotion. (I say 'for the most part' because Ari looks far less simian than do most of the other apes- Tim Burton obviously felt that the audience would be more likely to accept her as a sympathetic character if she looked half-human). The actors playing apes actually seem more convincing than those playing humans. Tim Roth is good as the militaristic Thade, as is Helena Bonham-Carter as Ari. Mark Wahlberg, on the other hand, is not an actor of the same caliber as Charlton Heston, who played the equivalent role in the original film, and Estella Warren has little to do other than look glamorous. (Heston has a cameo role as an ape in Burton's film, and even gets to repeat his famous line 'Damn you all to hell'). Overall, however, the film is a disappointment when compared to the original, a simple science-fiction adventure story as opposed to an intelligent and philosophical look at complex issues. It tried to copy the device of a surprise ending but failed. Schaffner's famous final twist is shocking, but makes perfect sense in the context of what has gone before. Burton's makes no sense whatsoever.Tim Burton can be a director of great originality, but with 'Planet of the Apes' he fell into the standard Hollywood trap of trying to copy what had already been done and remaking a film that never needed to be remade. It was good to see him return to form with the brilliant 'Big Fish', one of the best films of last year. 6/10","281 out of 359 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Underrated","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2409557/?ref_=tt_urv","on_the_can","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4671065/?ref_=tt_urv","6 April 2011","In the spring of 2001 audiences seemed eager to see Tim Burton's retelling of the 1968 classic, ""Planet of the Apes."" By the summer of 2001 it seemed to be the movie everybody loved to hate. Were the criticisms fair? Not if you ask me.2001's Planet of the Apes' biggest downfall, in my opinion, is unfortunately also it's biggest strength. Unlike many remakes which often end up as nothing more than weaker rehashes of their predecessor's this version of 'Apes' dared to be different. The plot has been stripped down to its bare bones and then rebuilt into something completely new. This is refreshing, if you ask me. Especially when rewatching it now, because just a few short years after this film came out we launched into sort of a remake renaissance, where half the tent pole films that come out every year are the same lesser rehashes that I spoke of a second ago. This film does take a moment here and there to wink at the '68 original, but Burton and his merry band of screenwriters has created a world completely original...it could be watched next to any entry of that original series as a wholey different film.This is also the film's biggest flaw though, or at least financially speaking, because the original 'Apes' franchise has a cult following behind it that could almost rival that of Star Wars or Star Trek. The core audience for this film really only wanted to see their favourite story told with modern day effects and makeup. I don't think we needed that, but I'm not sure how many would agree with me.Now, if you want to compare the two films plots and decide which one is stronger that's a whole other debate. But I don't think that's fair, that's why I champion it for taking such a different approach. I don't think this movie should be compared to any other movie and with that mindset a much better appreciation can be found. To put it bluntly, this movie ain't bad...in fact it's actually pretty good.I won't deconstruct the plot for you...if you're interested enough to be reading this you probably at least know the jist of it anyway. But it's a solid and interesting plot that sets up a very fun and entertaining action adventure flick. Visually its in many ways a departure from typical Burton fair but his stamp is definitely evident in its art direction, and the atmosphere he creates in this jungle/desert/urban/high tech universe is really something to behold. The apes are not only impressive in terms of makeup but they are also creatively impressive from the choices of the species to match personalities, the incredible costumes and simply perfect performances by a cast who act through all that latex. And while I'm praising I'll also throw up a shout out for Danny Elfman's great score, which just might be one of his best.The only caveat I'll lay on the movie is that the twist ending, obviously conceived to rival the famous twist of the original, kind of falls flat. BUT...considering how many instalments the original franchise had I have no doubt that the producers had hoped to make a sequel had this film been more financially successful, and had that sequel been made maybe we would've learned the story behind this twist and all would've been forgiven.It's a little too late to say, 'long story short,' but I will anyway. Give this movie a fair shot. It may not be without its flaws but how many movies are? Try not to compare it to the original, just watch it with a bowl of popcorn and have fun.","165 out of 217 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Escape from the Boulle planet.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512523/?ref_=tt_urv","dbdumonteil","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1219578/?ref_=tt_urv","29 August 2001","Visually,this film is sometimes a splendor;the light falls on a crepuscular world.The Apes' town is quite scary particularly when you see it from a distance ,as it stands out against an ominous sky.In the very beginning,the cast and credits are also successful,with an adequate martial music.The first third has some funny,parodic and sometimes politically incorrect lines.In the second third,the movie begins to lose steam,although the discovery in the wrecked spaceship is a rather good idea. But that's not all good news.First of all,the hero lacks charisma and the apes and their sensational make-up simply overwhelm him and drown him out.On the contrary,majestic Charlton Heston,even when he was in chains,displayed a Shakespearian grandeur in the first version.The last third consists in battles,a ""second coming"" and the ""astonishing"" ending without which..that would not be ""planet of the apes"".Actually,the new ending was borrowed from Pierre Boulle 's novel,but not without adding a mathematically unlikelihood which will give you headaches if you begin to think too hard:the least they can do:Everything ,even the proper nouns from the French writer's book have been removed,even if some characters recall some of the Boulle/Shaffner version.Shaffner had contented himself with changing the astronauts' name(eg:Ulysse Mérou=Taylor) Hats off to Helena Bonham-Carter who brings warmth and emotion in a rather vapid cast:in a part close to that of Kim Hunter/Zira,she really asserts her distinctive identity. Tim Roth is effective as well,but his part is less so.David Warner and Kris Kristofferson are wasted.As a tribute to Shaffner(?)both Linda Harrison (an unidentified woman captured with Leo) and Charlton Heston (moaning his curse,which is,admittedly,funny)appear unbilled.Tim Burton might be a director to remember.Although he has not made a genuine masterpiece yet,his filmography is already rich:""Sleepy hollow"",""Edward Scissorhands ,the marvelous ""Ed Wood"" (Martin Landau is unforgettable).But redoing ""planet of the apes "" was a hard task.Shaffner's movie followed a progression,it moved slowly,from the long introduction showing the three astronauts making their way across desolate landscapes to the stunning final shots with Heston and Harrison 's roaming down by the sea.Remember how long it took Taylor to convince Zira he was a thinking man!Here it seems natural to Ari almost as soon as she sees him,that Leo is no dumb idiot animal.And that's the last straw,even Tim Roth (some kind of cross between Shaffner's Cornelius and a pulp fiction baddie)pretty damn quickly believes too that that human is too clever for his own sake.Tim Burton's so-so remake epitomizes the dearth of good scripts.Pierre Boulle's book is a golden mine and one could have written a coherent story out of it,different from that of the first version.Why not,for instance,introduce the two ""astronauts"" whose scenes open and close it,and turn Leo's adventures into a flashback?What about showing the love between the hero and the woman-animal ?And the son they had?And the menace this son represented for the simian race? All these ideas were left over by Shaffner's script writers and could have built a strong new tale.The main flaw lies in the human beings:here,they speak -English!- ,they can reason,they can swim (!),they are (except for bubble head Warren)clever,so why the hell did the apes tame them?","58 out of 97 found this helpful.

But they could have at least got the beginning right.  Neither Mark Wahlberg's character nor the tension is ever developed, so when he is confronted by the apes: we feel nothing.The humans, though they have the benefit of increased intelligence and speech, are poorly utilized.  And Kris Kristofferson is criminally wasted.The make-up and effects are, as you would expect, fantastic.  However, despite improved flexibility in the make-up, there is little warmth in either the performances or direction that made millions of kids go ape-nuts in the seventies.  Bonham-Carter's Ari, whilst convincing, is not a patch on Kim Hunter's Zira.  Roth's quite brilliant performance as Thade virtually carries this film and makes it the one reason to stick with it to the end.Did I say end?  Well, the less said about that the better.","159 out of 226 found this helpful.

I really appreciate the different approach to the story from Tim Burton's as i really think this Planet Of The Apes remake was pretty good overall, but what lacking the most i think was that because i believe this is a pretty straight forward movie, it happens pretty quickly to the conflict that i felt what lacking the most was the characters development, i do felt in the first half of the movie there is not much of a personality in the characters specifically Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter characters, Thade i found quite annoying instead of terrifying in the first half until at the end i can admit that he was basically a mad ape, and Ari was just not as good of a character or sweet of a character as Dr. Zira in the original even if they didn't want to make her like it, but it's not like i hate the characters, they just flawed characters, and i'm finally fine with them towards the end, including the story which i thought again not as clever as the original but i still really enjoyed it and in fact the best thing about the movie, i like the makeup and the costume design, i like Mark Wahlberg in the film, Tim Burton's Planet Of The Apes remake takes on a very different but still interesting take on the story, flawed but still pretty good overall.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

Yet another movie classic utterly ruined by a cheap, shallow, effect-heavy and redundant remake. The original ""Planet of the Apes"" was an intelligent and thought-provoking movie with a very clear message. It was a movie that focused almost entirely on dialogue, which sounds very dull but was in fact very interesting. This movie, on the other hand, seems to have done away with pretty much ALL the dialogues. Instead of a great movie we get an incredibly stupid two hour chase movie. Dialogue has been reduced to a mere minimum, character interaction and development are non-existent and most of the time it's extremely hard to figure out what's going on. Instead, we get a bunch of pointless action scenes, some marginally funny one-liners and some very hollow quasi-intelligent conversations. The only thing worth mentioning about this movie is that it looks absolutely fantastic. The make-up of the apes is magnificent, and the sets and backgrounds are beautiful too. However, this does not distract from the fact that ""Planet of the Apes (2001)"" is a very shallow and simplistic movie, filled with paper-thin characters, stupid dialogue and a nearly non-existent plot. Please Hollywood, stop ruining great movies by turning them into senseless blockbusters.Oh yeah, the ending did not make ANY SENSE WHATSOEVER.

It wasn't supposed to be an action-packed tour de force, but rather a thinking man's film.  What happened to the debates about man's role in this society?  What about the science and experiments conducted on man in the older movie?  I had other problems with the film too: Helena Bonham Carter seemed too overly obsessed with this human too quickly and for no reason.  Where the heck was Cornelius anyway?  So why did I give it a 7?  The makeup was truly fantastic, and the action choreographed well.  As a standalone movie, it would have been alright, but unfortunately, it has a legacy to live up to.  The second reason for the high score was the sexy, sensuous presence of Estella Warren.  It seems she was cheated out of a role here; why didn't she become romantically involved with him?What was her backstory?

The original Planet of the Apes (POTA) opened the door to this new world and made it interesting and believable.This movie is very different than the original. About halfway though, it is clear this movie is going in a different direction. Basically, a astronaut crash lands on planet populated by apes (the dominant species) and humans (the ones who exist in the wild, and as slaves). Soon after he is captured, he picks up the homing beacon to a rescue ship... and the story progresses from there.That's a pretty great setup, and the story progresses in a totally different direction than the original. I really appreciated that because it made the movie all the more interesting.The special effects were one of the big treats of this movie. Not only do we get scenes with the spacecraft, space station, etc. at the beginning (unlike the original), but the character makeup of the apes was fantastic. The variety of body builds, faces, personalities, etc. was very entertaining to watch. Somehow they made Helena Bonham Carter look ""sexy"" as a young animal rights activist/chimpanzee... and Tim Roth look more threatening and aggressive than just about any character I've seen in the movies. Brilliant work.The ape habitats were also kind of cool. If you want to know what an ape kitchen, dining room, bedroom, etc. looks like, you'll get a peek in side some of them in this movie.All the thematic hallmarks of the original are present (role-reversal, overt prejudice and cruelty, fight for equal-rights). While they are probably not as impactive as they were given how times have change, they still deliver a sting about who unpleasant such a society is.While I wouldn't say this is as strong a movie as the original, it is still a fun movie see and worth checking out.","20 out of 27 found this helpful.

Even with the advancements in technology and special effects since Charlton Heston first landed on the planet, it's kind of like an aging actor getting yet another face-lift; it looks good but it just can't recapture that original beauty, no matter how good the surgeon is.  And `Planet of the Apes' couldn't have had a better man to hold the scalpel, but even director Tim Burton couldn't make this one any more than what it is, an imaginative adventure story that basically just puts a new face on something tried and true.  It looks great, and the atmosphere Burton created fairly crackles; but as a story, we've been there, done that, and even with a slightly different twist at the end, this one simply does not have much to add, with the exception that the apes really look good.  But does being able to showcase make-up and F/X wizards justify resurrecting this one?  I guess the bottom line is, this movie's going to make a killing at the box office. 
	It all begins on a space station where some highly advanced chimps are being trained to go into space and do amazing things.  One of those in charge of these wannabe astronauts is Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), and when his special ward, Pericles, is launched and lost in a huge electrical storm, Leo jumps into a space capsule and takes it upon himself to go where no man has gone before.  He quickly gets swallowed up by the storm himself, and after some exceptionally good visual effects, he not only gets spewed out onto an unknown planet, but he's some four to five hundred years into the future.  He emerges from his landing with nary a scratch, but after barely having enough time to catch his breath or get his bearings, he finds himself caught up in the middle of some kind of hunt, and the prey happens to be humans.  And it's then, of course, that he discovers that something is terribly wrong here.  Apes are the hunters, and they seem to be in charge of everything.  He readily discerns that there doesn't seem to be much percentage in attempting a parley at this juncture, intelligent as the marauding primates appear to be, so he opts for that which is often the better part of valor:  He runs.  And the adventure begins in earnest.	If this movie had to be made (which obviously, it did) at least the right man ended up in the director's chair, because Burton has a way creating a look and a mood that suits this kind of material perfectly, just as he did with `Batman,' `Sleepy Hollow' and `Edward Scissorhands' (just to name a few).  But there just isn't that much story here.  It's an incredible journey, to be sure, but it's just not fresh enough to maintain interest for very long, even as good as it looks and exciting as it gets.  And, whereas the original had something of a message about the miasmatic direction society was headed, about the only message here is the one that can be found in the `Cha-ching!' of the cash register.	As the hero of the tale, Wahlberg comports himself well enough, but in all fairness, this wasn't a role that required much emoting.  Basically, if he could run well and look alternately confused and determined, the part was his.  He did and it was.  And to his credit, he did it very well.  Character development was unnecessary for the purposes of this film, so with Leo, what you see is what you get.  No surprises, and you never really get to know much about who this guy is or what makes him tick-- but it doesn't make any difference.  He's the hero, he cares about his chimp, and that's all you have to know.	Helena Bonham Carter does a terrific job as Ari, the Ape who champions the cause of the humans, in whom she sees a value beyond the level of degradation to which her peers have consigned them.  Of all of those in the cast, she actually manages to do some acting, and she does it exceptionally well, expressing herself much better than what anyone would have the right to expect here, especially taking the cumbersome make-up into consideration. You cannot help, however, getting a sense that this is what it would have been like had Merchant/Ivory made `Gorillas In the Mist.'	As General Thade, the ruthless military leader of the apes, Tim Roth adds a villain to his resume that is quite unlike any he's played before and, like Bonham Carter, actually gives a remarkable and agile performance, all things considered.	The supporting cast includes Michael Clarke Duncan (Attar), Kris Kristofferson (Karubi), Estella Warren (Daena), Paul Giamatti (providing some comic relief as Limbo, the slave trader),Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa (Krull) and features a clever cameo by Charlton Heston.  Taken at face value for the action/adventure film it is, `Planet of the Apes' is entertaining, but lacks the substance of the original and may be disappointing to anyone hoping for anything more than a visually engaging foray into a kind of twilight zone of the new millennium.  For what it is, it's well made and delivered; it just seems that the talent involved with this project could have been better served elsewhere.  I rate this one 6/10.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Its occasional paraphrasing of lines from the original movie (devoid of any meaningful context), and its cameos by members of the original cast (Charlton Heston and Linda Harrison), only underscore that this new version isn't what the original was, i.e., an original.  Mark Wahlberg, as Our Hero, has none of the cynical, edgy complexity of Heston's Taylor, and is in fact the sort of can-do flyboy Taylor found laughable.  Much as I adore Helena Bonham Carter, her turn as Ari, a sultry, sexy, meddling, annoying human-rights activist, is ultimately tiresome, and absolutely incomparable to Kim Hunter's brave, brilliant, impish Zira of the old series.  The role is also a criminal waste of Bonham Carter's beauty, hidden as it is behind a bizarre makeup that looks neither ape nor human.  Rick Baker's highly-touted ape makeups (which I've enjoyed since the days of ""Schlock"" and ""Kentucky Fried Movie"") are highly uneven here.  Tim Roth's villainous Thade has the best, with most of the rest being just adequate and no particular improvement over John Chambers' work in the original.  And the socko ending (keep reading; I won't spoil it for you) is simply tacked on: unlike the jolting end of the original, it neither ties together nor arises from the movie's earlier action in a way that Explains Everything.  Instead, it begs so many questions (mainly ""How the heck did THAT happen?"") that it seems engineered (or contrived) solely to set the stage for more sequels.  All told, this is ""Apes Lite,"" a comic-bookish caricature of the original, made for the short-attention-span crowd.  It made me want to do something I hadn't done in ages: fire up the VCR and roll the original again.  It's typical of the 1968 movie's gritty, clever irony that the first word of dialogue uttered by an ape--his entire line, in fact--is ""Smile.""","88 out of 138 found this helpful.

The thing is this remake(or re-imagining if you like) is not, in fact this could very well be Burton's worst movie, even worse than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and that could have been much better. Tim Burton, what has happened to you? Before I get to the many negatives of this film, I will say the apes are very well done. Their mannerisms and the way they move are perfectly convincing. Plus Danny Elfman's score was pretty good, it's no Edward Scissorhands or Big Fish but it's good enough. And the scenery and special effects are fantastic.However, that is all the praise I can give it. I am briefly going to say it is vastly inferior to the 1968 classic, which was much more exciting and much better written as well. The script is awful, not quite Pearl Harbor kind-of-awful, but some of it is lame and unintentionally cheesy. The story takes a while to get going and meanders all over the place, not helped by pedestrian pacing and drawn out scenes and very rarely gets interesting. Plus is it me, or does the film get unnecessarily loud at times? Tim Burton's direction was also a disappointment, usually his films are full of heart, that's what made Edward Scissorhands especially such a gem, but here he seems lost, bogged down might I say. On top of that, the character development is non-existent, as is the chemistry between the actors and the characters are extremely clichéd, especially Kris Kristofferson's character. And the acting didn't fare that much better, Mark Wahlberg is a bland lead, while Estella Warren acts like a zombie throughout. Then we have Tim Roth trying hard and giving the only credible performance as Thade, and Helena Bonham Carter wasted as sympathetic Ari, while Paul Giamatti is useless. Not even the talented David Warner can save this film. And don't get me started on the ending, what a bummer, so predictable and obvious.Overall, a case of all style no substance. Definitely not Burton's finest hour. 3/10 Bethany Cox","18 out of 28 found this helpful.

A decade later I decided to pop the movie in and give it another go. Yep, I still feel the same! Love the movie, love the makeup and costuming, love the themes discussed and by all means, love the cliff hanger Tim Burton uses in the end. I have all kinds of love for this movie. Seems like Tim Burton had a vision of more movies in the Ape regime; sadly for some of us it just did not see its way through due to the entire mixed acceptance back in 2001. Tim Burton as all you readers are aware is quite unorthodox and eccentric in his directorial choices. For those of you who are not as familiar as some of us, he gave us ""Alice In Wonderland"" , ""Sweeney Todd"", ""Corpse Bride"", ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" ""Sleepy Hallow"" & ""Edward Scissor Hands"" to name a few. If you are a reader who follows movies not by trailer but by director, 8 out of 10 have watched all of the above. ""Planet of the Apes"" with comparison to Burton's style is quite different. It's a Sci Fi that discuss themes of Animal Cruelty, Humans vs Nature and also if you want to be scoffer who hates this movie, a remake of classic Sci Fi from 1968. I respect classics, however what if I can watch it done slightly better. The costuming and make up is brilliant in comparison to the classic. However my intention is not to compare this with the reputed classic. 5 Stars and a round of applause for the magnificent work put in by the team with the makeup and costuming. For a movie made a decade ago this is brilliant, I have watched movies done in the past 2 years that can't even hold a candle to this effort. There is a lot of emotion that is required to be conveyed, which was a vital element to carry out the emotional wave. Giving the extra advantage of excellent facial movement makes it so realistic, never would I have for a moment felt, it is false and it is just a movie. I was right there in the middle of it all. Thumbs up yet again! As much as I respect Mark Wahlbergs performance, I have to side with Tim Roth on this one. Bold performance! The ferocity, the valor, the true determination to make every human suffer he nailed it all. Tim Roth although under so much of makeup, has his presence; he is just scared to look at. He is the meanest Ape I have seen so far. Helena Bonham Carter, who later marries director Burton in real life, was convincing and also was the vital link that ties human affection and animal cruelty on a broader perspective. Personally though I felt that Carter has so much more potential is capable of contributing more. (But wait! Am I comparing her to who she has become before she became?)We do not realize what it is like to be caged, or to be treated as pets or even as beasts, but seems like there is much to fathom from this, animals feel as much as we do. These are lessons for some of us who beat our pets up, or for those who don't leave a clean bowl of water for your dog every day. Doesn't look too great when the tables are turned does it? Also we humans don't realize that once done, certain things can never be undone (You have to watch the movie till the end to understand this). Wahlberg clearly states in the movie that we humans hurt each other way more than we hurt animals on his home planet? Have you ever stopped to think how true that it is? With such beautiful themes that are very well deeply hidden it disheartens me that this movie never got the place it rightfully still deserves. A decade is a long time, but the copies are still out there. I am pretty certain that most of the younger generations never have seen this one; just like back in 2001 I had never seen the 1968 classic!","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

"","","Biggest disappointment of 2001!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512807/?ref_=tt_urv","the amorphousmachine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0654641/?ref_=tt_urv","25 October 2003","Awhile back, I commented on the original 'Planet of the Apes' film prior to seeing this remake at the cinemas. When I saw the original, I was fully expecting the remake to kick some serious butt, and be far superior to the 1960s version. Why? Better visual effects being 2001 and all, one of my favorite actors in Tim Roth starring in it, and a great director named Tim Burton. Nothing could surely go wrong with Burton in the director's chair. Granted, I was never a huge fan of the POTA films, but seeing the potential here for a remake or revision by Burton made my mouth water. Then, in 2001, I got advance tickets and I began to watch one of the most anticipated movies for that year...I left the cinema very disappointed! Disappointment can cloud criticism though, and sometimes makes you bitter towards a movie and not see the positives. So I tried to look at the good. The make-up was excellent, but inconsistent in parts, but I still feel that area should have been nominated for an Oscar. Okay, that's good! Tim Roth was amazing in his performance but his character was not that great and seriously lacked depth. Helena Bonham Carter was also fairly decent in this film. And, finally some of the cinematography was fairly nice. What really let the remake of 'Planet of the Apes' down, was by in large, Tim Burton. This is, without a doubt, his worst film that I've seen! I cannot really compliment the direction of this movie, as it seemed self-aware and indulgent in being the ""remake"". The script was awful, as well as the integration of one-liners from the original films to this new one. I groaned completely during Heston's cameo, particularly due the referrals to the original film. The remake should have been a film in its own right, and should have focused on creating a compelling story and universe, instead of opting for lame jokes revolving around Charlton Heston in ape make-up as Thade's father. The hero of the new film in Mark Whalberg was one-note, but he was given such a boring character who just went through the motions. Going to take a risk- check, gets sucked through a new dimension- check, captured by Apes- check, escape- check and so on and so on. I never felt anything for his character at all, and that was partly his performance and partly the woeful script/direction. Estella Warren was awful, and Kris Kristofferson played the obligatory predictable role of the her father. Michael Clarke Duncan suited his part, but never became a well established character, and Paul Giamatti was okay as Limbo, but was obviously the comic relief. I also did not like the art direction was the Ape City, and found the original far more convincing in look and as a story.
While, General Thade was certainly a memorable chimp because of Roth's performance, it's a shame the character was wasted in an extremely formulaic and cliche story! 'Planet of the Apes' (2001) is nowhere near the worst film of 2001, it certainly was the most disappointing for me, considering the potential it had with the dynamic vision of Tim Burton and the modern visual f/x to create a film that stands out in its own right. It's just a pity Tim Burton chose to make a Hollywoodized self-aware gimmicky version that ends up being significantly inferior to the original film, instead of on par with it! And yes, Burton's 'Mars Attacks' is also better than his remake here! 'Planet of the Apes' gets a reluctant pass for Tim Roth's performance, the superb make-up and the decent cinematography, however that still doesn't save it from silly mediocrity.**½ out of *****!","62 out of 115 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A Mixed Bag, but Ultimately a Decent Addition to the Apes Saga","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2979303/?ref_=tt_urv","Wuchakk","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4409266/?ref_=tt_urv","14 March 2014","YEAR: 2001 DIRECTOR: Tim Burton COUNTRY: USA RUNTIME: 119 minutesTHE PLOT: An astronaut (Mark Wahlberg) crashlands on a planet ruled by apes where humans are considered animals and slaves, even though they are intelligent and can speak. The astronaut soon leads the humans to revolt.I don't think there's any question that Tim Burton really knows how to make a film look great. And so it is with this remake of ""Planet of the Apes."" The locations, sets, ape make-up, costumes, cast, score (Danny Elfman) and direction are all outstanding. Just as good as the original film and, in many cases, even better. Unfortunately, the overall results are a mixed bag.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: The biggest problem with this remake is that there is no build-up of mystery. Wahlberg crashlands to the planet very early on in the story, just like in the original film. Unfortunately, as soon as he lands he's IMMEDIATELY thrust into the ape/human conflict, captured and taken to the ape city. This flashes by so quickly that the viewer could easily MISS IT ALL if s/he got up for a few minutes to get something from the kitchen!! The original took its time in this matter; Taylor (Heston) and his fellow astronauts obviously crashland in the middle of nowhere and explore the planet for a long period of time before eventually encountering the inhabitants of the planet. It's all very mysterious, and there's a lot of build-up to the ape revelation.It's also highly unbelievable that Wahlberg would crashland right into the midst of the human/ape conflict. The planet is the size of Earth, so what are the chances that he'd land right in the middle of the fray? I suppose Burton and the writers didn't want the film to bog down once Wahlberg crashlands, but couldn't they have at least given us FIVE MINUTES of exploration time, giving the impression that Wahlberg searches for a fairly long period of time before encountering the humans and apes? As it's presented it's simply too unbelievable.This is a major misstep; and because it happens so early in the film it strongly tempts most intelligent viewers (who naturally MUST have some reasonable amount of believability to enjoy sci-fi) to lose faith in the picture and tune out or, at least, become excessively critical of the remainder of the film.Another problem with the picture is that I just simply failed to really get caught up in the characters and their story. There needed to be more character-defining dialogue. A well written script causes the viewer to be CAPTIVATED by the storyline. Well, I never fully got captivated.These factors explain why I was severely let down when first viewing the film at the theater in 2001.WHAT WORKS: Seeing the film again recently, I was braced for these flaws and willing to suspend disbelief to (try to) enjoy the story. I now conclude that there are numerous worthwhile qualities to the remake.For one thing, although Mark Wahlberg is no Charleton Heston (Taylor was Heston's greatest role and performance IMHO), I think he does a great job as the protagonist. Helena Bonham Carter is also fabulous in the Zira-like role of Ari; she really brings Ari to life and makes her unique. And as beautiful as Linda Harrison was as Nova, Estella Warren pretty much blows her out of the water in the counterpart role of Daena. Unfortunately her character is shallow and we never get a satisfyingly good look at Estelle in all her voluptuous glory. But, no matter, what we DO see is breathtaking.Tim Roth is utterly evil as the villainous Thade. This is very much in contrast to Dr. Zaius in the original, who was actually a very noble character. Lastly, the giant Michael Clarke Duncan is magnificent as the gorilla general, Thade's ""friend.""As to be expected, the ape make-up is WAY better than the original, even though I still love the job they did in the earlier film. The ape characters don't only look more like highly evolved apes compared to the original, they walk, talk, howl, grunt, jump, fight and climb more like real apes.The ape city sets are fabulous too, albeit a bit too dark for my tastes. I find this unbelievable and verging on cartooney. I know Burton is into Goth and therefore prefers dark lighting, but it would be nice to actually SEE the wonderful sets made for the film (or perhaps he doesn't want the viewer to get too good a look and see how artificial they really are? I don't know, I'm just guessing).I also liked all the homages to the original film -- the various lines, Linda Harrison, Charleton Heston as Thade's dying father, etc.Although numerous people had a problem with the ending, I think they did a good job. How else better to end it? Notice how the camera mysteriously shoots from behind the ""Lincoln Memorial"" just like the original does with the Statue of Liberty.FINAL ANALYSIS: Despite a couple major flaws there's a lot to appreciate in Burton's remake. It's not as good as the original or ""Beneath,"" but it's, at least, on a par with ""Escape."" And it's certainly better than ""Conquest"" and, especially, ""Battle.""The bottom line is that Tim Burton's remake of ""Planet of the Apes"" is a worthwhile addition to your apes film collection. For serious ""Apes"" fans it's even mandatory because, even though -- OVERALL -- it doesn't come close to the greatness of the original (or ""Beneath""), it has numerous singular aspects that surpass it.GRADE: C+ or B-","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

The ""climax"" creates some interest but is over far too quickly.Sure the apes are impressive but much of the effect is obscured by the darkness that shrouds 80% of the movie.Oh and then there's the ending which is the biggest sham I've yet to see in movies. It leaves you feeling like you were just scammed out of your money, taking place in a marketing gimmick. I am refering to the blatant set up for a sequel.Hollywood seems content just to fill cinema's on hype without trying to give any satisfication to those foolish enough to waste there money (or think this one will be any different from the last 10)Wait for DVD.Mike","8 out of 11 found this helpful.

I respect the original for what it was but this version directed by Tim Burton is visually spectacular and exceeds expectations.Nobody creates a fanciful world like Burton can and there is no better duo than Tim Burton and Helena Bonham Carter. The costumes for the apes are incredible with intricate details that look very realistic. The sheer enormity of the sets makes you realise how much energy and passion went into creating this film.I love all the action, and the special effects still seem remarkable even after more than 10 years has past. Sometimes people can't move past the original but if you have never seen the 1968 version then I think you will enjoy this movie. Also it is perfect to watch again now that the new planet of the apes movie series has started to be released.","44 out of 68 found this helpful.

My initial impression: Shock.  I had never before witnessed such a captivated tale.  The series kept getting better with each movie.  Not long after I found out that Tim Burton was to remake ""The Planet of the Apes"" and I asked myself, ""Why bother?""  The original series have hardly aged a bit and are still vastly entertaining to watch.  Even though the original is over 30 years old, it doesn't feel like it at all.  I felt there was no need for a remake.  I saw the new film on opening day, and I have to say I was disappointed.  The movie wasn't as shocking as the original.  It wasn't as captivating.  It wasn't anything like the original. The only thing that seemed to save it was the truly shocking twist ending. It really made me think for a while, but, eventually, I gave up.  It didn't make sense to me at all.  Then, I decided to throw all my initial thoughts of the film away and decided to go see it again for a second opinion, and, this time, I was blown away.  Rarely do I see a film and loathe it only to go see it again and absolutley love it.  I didn't compare it to the original as I did the first time, and I think that's the reason I completely hated it the first time around.  Tim Burton really did an amazing job creating a whole new world of apes where humans are slaves.  The cinematography, the set designs, and just about every technical aspect of the film is a marvel, especially the make up and costume designs.  Danny Elfman's score is one of his best, and at times, very frightening.  The acting is also top notch, from Wahlberg's subtle but heroic portrayal of Leo, to Roth who is absolutely stunning as General Thade.  This has got to be the most impressive movie of the summer, if not the year, easily on par with ""Hannibal"".  Just don't go see it and compare it with the original.  My grade: A-","40 out of 71 found this helpful.

The latter is used only when the former is weak and they have no idea how to really make the remake a better attempt than the original. This is one of those times.The main problem with this work is not the other the top apes, the shortened story line, the effects, the story itself, or the premise. The problem with this work is that Mark Walberg, though I do like him as an actor, is NOT a lead actor. Sorry Mark, but you're not. Mark Walberg is a great supporting actor, but he does not bear the presence on screen to bolster any movie, unless it is something small and weak enough to make him seem stronger. It's not his acting, it's his presence, or lack thereof.As far as this film goes, he IS the weakest element of what otherwise could have been a successful attempt, but Burton's works seem to deteriorate in the third act, with few exceptions, thereby calling for a strongly-written ending, something completely unexpected, or something totally over the top, in order to strengthen his inability to keep it together. Sleep Hollow is one example of a Burton work which does not fall into that generality, but only barely. A good example would probably be Ed Wood, which was bad enough on its own, and for other reasons.The reinvention of the Planet of the Apes was generally despised by Baby Boomers who loved the original campy, sometimes horrid Apes run, by virtue of fond childhood memories. The idea of combining several of these ""beloved"" works into one movie failed to generate the positive response the studio hoped for, and even served as a catalyst to bring down the work entirely, were it not for the name Tim Burton.As it is, this work went on to almost quadruple its initial budget, but the studios listened for once, and did not continue on with this line. At the base, this whole work was weak, from script to post production work, and in every way in between. So why the 6.8 rating? Because it served well to make younger audiences seek out the originals, and in spite of it all, this work IS entertaining! It rates a 6.8/10 from...the Fiend :.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I like where he's coming from, and he shares much of the same taste as me: a liking for the offbeat, the Gothic, a love for the Hammer horrors of old. But his films are a mixed bag and for every great one (MARS ATTACKS, ED WOOD) there are ones that leave me ice cold (CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, ALICE IN WONDERLAND).My favourite Burton film is SWEENEY TODD, so it may be that I get on better with the ones aimed at adults rather than kids. Sadly, his PLANET OF THE APES remake is aimed purely at kids, and in fact there's no material that ever goes above the intellectual level of your average 4 year old. And if ever there was a film that didn't need remaking, it was PLANET OF THE APES! Everything goes wrong with this picture, and I mean everything. The muddled, dumb-ass script which never goes beyond characters running from A to B, then B to C, and so on for what feels like hours and hours. The ridiculous-looking apes, never menacing for a second and looking more dated now than the ones from the original back in the '60s. Burton's clear disinterest in the material, as evinced by his mundane direction. Wahlberg's embarrassingly wooden performance, or Bonham Carter's embarrassingly mannered one.It's all a great shame, in that it wastes money and the talents of lots of interesting supporting cast members whose skills could have been put towards something more genuine and original. Instead this is one of the worst films I've witnessed in a while, a truly abominable production.","22 out of 38 found this helpful.

I enjoyed this re-imagining but it was just okay - not great. The acting was mediocre - the sets and special effects were good and the make-up was of course spectacular.What really lets it down is the plot. For example, in the original film the human slaves couldn't speak, reinforcing the fact that the apes saw them as savages. When Taylor (Charlton Heston) spoke, it was a potent weapon against the apes' prejudice - the fact that he had language and thus cognitive abilities shook their entire belief system. In this movie the humans are chatting away normally which lessens the importance of Davidson's (Mark Whalberg) arrival.And could somebody please tell me what the point of the blond woman was? Sure she is beautiful, but her character just felt tacked onto the plot to provide some eye candy.I found the ending to be a big let down - again it was clumsily stuck into the film to provide that twist in the tail. It just didn't feel like it was part of the story, but more of an afterthought.Despite my criticism, I enjoyed the movie. There's some great action scenes and hey - it's Planet of the Apes! There's nothing horribly bad about it - it just doesn't live up to the wonderful original.Rent this one or wait for it to be on TV.7/10","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

And to boot, Estella Warren has like 10 lines in the movie - she's basically Darth Maul all over again, but with a supermodel body instead of a lightsaber. Character development, which is crucial to any good story, is completely lacking - some characters sort of get a real cheesy and formulaic revelation near the end, but the hero and antagonist stay the exact same throughout the whole movie.Sure, everyone's saying ""well, they were up against a lot when they decided to re-make an old classic,"" which is true, but they didn't make a good movie - they just took the standard sci-fi / horror / action movie plotline and put apes in the place of villans.  It's a formula and it's really really sad, and regardless of what movie they're trying to remake, going with the standard formula will satisfy the masses, but it won't ever be a ""good"" movie.","10 out of 15 found this helpful.

I can't really back a guy that stupid. Then the parts that are his fault is that he is just a bad actor and has a look about him I just don't care for.  Of course, he ends up landing on a planet run buy super monkeys.  The people playing the monkeys do a very good job with their parts.  I don't have anything bad to say about them, except that their good job makes Wahlberg look even worse.  Tim Roth is great as is Carter.  All the apes do well.  Kris Kristofferson is not in the movie enough and is killed relatively early.  I wish he were in it more; they needed one good human character in this one.

I don't know why all the movies I happen to despise became huge successful films. Probably because the general person now-a-days is just looking for visuals, special effects, and action sequences.What happened to plot? I suppose it's dead. If you even remotely liked the original ""Planet of the Apes (1968)"", then don't see this mockery. It was definitely up there with, ""Hannibal"" as one of my most hated films.Even the score of ""The Planet of the Apes (2001)"" is repetitive, slow, and unoriginal - admittedly similar to the film's plot. The only surprise I found in this movie was Tim Burton's cunning idea of putting a frame of Hitler in the start of the film. The background for the frame or two of Der Fuhrer was some kind of nonsensical sci-fi blur that couldn't even logically happen in a galaxy far, far away let alone our own. However, don't worry Burton even hinted bestiality in this film (Not a surprise, I suspected it). I know that's horrible, but it's worth a good laugh... at how bad this movie was.Tim Burton: Does this movie even smell of his style? No. This movie doesn't have anything that would make me remotely think Tim Burton directed it. It has none of his early style and ideal that made his earlier work appealing and launched him into the mainstream. If you think you like Tim Burton's work and this movie's got to be good because he directed it, think again. If you liked his earlier work like, ""Edward Scissorhands,"" an excellent film in my mind: Don't go see his remake of Planet of the Apes. It will make you nauseous and annoyed.This film eliminates most of the great ideas of its original, which inspired so much wonderment, joy, and captivation, i.e. In Burton's version every single human can talk. The ending is all wrong, distorted, and makes literally no sense. All of the appeal of the original is casted away. Even the acting in this remake is quite dull.I need to warn you again, if you liked the original Planet of the Apes, or Tim Burton's early work, this movie will make you sigh - big time. This movie is even a disgrace to the Sci-Fi genre.","12 out of 19 found this helpful.

Mark Wahlberg can't act. Perhaps we can blame some of the lines on the writers.

Being a remake of the 1968 original I didn't know what to expect from this film. To kick things off I do have to say that this film does have a a fairly exceptional cast in Mark Wahlberg, Helena Bonham-Carter, Michael Clark Duncan, and Tim Roth. I thought that Wahlberg was a good fit for his role considering he usually takes up a daring, adventurous role quite well, and that Tim Roth was a bit out of his element I felt but he took on the Role of Thade quite well. As for Clark- Duncan and Helena Bonham-Carter I don't really want to get into my opinions as to how they fit into their parts, but I will say they performed satisfactorily. I liked how the story developed and I enjoyed most of it. Special Effects are lacking, and the ending was kind of lame. But overall I can give this movie a solid six.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

If my memory serves me, I think Dick Zanuck, who at one time was running mighty 20th century fox, was sitting around and thought to himself, why don't we remake planet of the apes and get an A-list director for it?  It's not a bad idea... problem is, the script isn't up to par.  In fact, it's pretty bad.  Secondly, Mark Walberg is way out of his league trying to carry the lead in this film.  I remember reading all the publicity for the film and laughed when Burton and Zanuck tried to compare Walberg to Steve McQueen.  Look, I like Walberg, I think he's a decent enough actor, but he's not at the point where he has the emotional gravitas to carry the lead in a film. The story has no emotional pathos.  It's just a simple A to B to C, nonstop chase film.  And what was the point of trying to keep the ending secret?  It doesn't even make sense.  They were trying to bring back that feeling of the ""oh my god, they were on earth the whole time"" feeling from the original POTA, but here it's just absolute rubbish.","17 out of 32 found this helpful.

What kept on making me look away from the 1968 original more or less was the fact that it's over twice as old as me, which I guess you could attribute to me as being ignorant. And after hearing so much complaining about this remake with me and my best friend not seeing why (who also had never seen the original), we decided to just rent both this and the original and see what the fuss was all about.I think after seeing the ending alone you know how I feel.If I'm not mistaken, this film was handed down to several directors before Tim Burton was finally ""credited"" as the main director (and towards the end of the film's production unless I've misread something). Either way this film really doesn't feel like a Burton film to me, if it did I'd be calling this film ""gritty"" or ""dark""; at least, for a few of the scenes. But other than some great visual style and excellent make-up on the apes it's tough for me to mention Tim Burton along with this film, it just doesn't feel like something he actually directed; not the whole way at least.It's funny that this film is supposed to be a ""remake"" when the only things it has in-common with the original are the name and the fact that the apes are superior to the humans. This is another odd thing that another reviewer pointed out; the apes don't seem to have that much over the humans other than brute strength most of the time. Whereas in the original the apes were both tougher and far more intelligent than the humans.Outside of this the film has little to nothing in-common with the original. The plot, characters, location(s) and even the ending are all different from the original. The only similarity you might be able draw is that one of the apes (a female that sees the humans as more than the other apes give them credit for) decides to help a few of them escape the ape city and go to the lands of their origins. Beyond this, and maybe a select few throwbacks to the original (the scarecrows part was pretty clever) you might be wondering if this is really a remake or just a very different re-imagining.As I mentioned earlier, this version has some great art/visual style and excellent make-up on the apes, which are even better than those of the original (even though in this day and age it's really a given for that to be the case if enough effort is put in). Really this is the film's biggest strength because outside of all the excellence visually there isn't much of a film to be had. The performances from almost everyone is average at best. Mark Wahlberg really isn't given too much to work with and you'll get plenty of his typical ""shocked"" stares. Tim Roth as General Thade actually does pretty well with his character and is arguably the most effective character. Needless to say, Helena Bonham Carter was intentionally given a bit more of a human look than the other apes, possibly to reflect her character's views on the humans in the film. Michael Clarke Duncan does well with what he's given and while he likely won't stand out for many he is a very convincing character given his size and voice (hopefully that doesn't sound too odd). Everyone else just feels like they're tagging along so there really isn't much to praise in the characters or actors other than that two of the main ape characters were handled very well. Oh, and I thought the cameo with Charles Heston was neat.Aside from this, a fun battle towards the end with the rebel humans and apes and an ending that'll likely leave those that haven't seen it puzzled as to what exactly happened, there really isn't too much to the film. My biggest problem with the ending is that we likely will never get an answer or resolution to it because of how negative the reception has been towards the film. I hate it when movie studios and the crew make a movie and leave room for a sequel but they never fully take into account possibility that the film will flop or just not do well. And in this film's case we're stuck with a film that had and in a sense still does have potential but are left asking ""when"" and ""what"".This film is very, very different from the '68 classic it's based on and as a result, it assumes you haven't seen the remake; or at least hopes you didn't. Since I saw this one before the original, my views on this remake were defensive and while I think it's far from as bad as some might make it out (and even as I myself might have made it out as well), it's very tough to fully appreciate it after seeing the original. So if you haven't seen this film yet (or even the original for that matter), I would personally see this one first so you can make a verdict on the film itself, then see the original and then make up your mind. As for those that have seen the original but not this, just go into it with an open mind and don't expect the same movie. And if anyone has seen both and wants to at least try and like this movie, try and watch it without having the original in mind. Keep the original in mind, and this film stinks. See this as its own film, and you should be able to find some redeeming values.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Many have praised its visuals while also condemning its confusing story, weak characters and an ending so baffling and weird that the film would instantly jump a couple of ranks if you left it out.And yeah, there's a lot of truth to that. The visuals are great, which has always been Burton's main forte. The ape costumes are still amazingly beautiful, the set and background designs are innovative and filled with small details. The colours are great, the cinematography is nice and it's an all-around good visual experience. Plus, some of the characters are nice. Mark Wahlberg as the main character is pretty bland, as he usually is, but he's a decent actor in his own way, so I guess we could have had worse. I especially like Helena Bonham Carter as Ari, our proxy for Zira from the original film. Easily the character with the most charisma in the film.But yeah, then the flaws. The story is pretty weak. At times it simply copies the plot of the original film to the nth degree, while at the same time making lame jokes at its expense. And at times it does not do that it veers into directions all its own, none of them making much sense or serving the overall story. The third act, when we learn all the secrets behind the world, is especially weak and will leave you at least somewhat disappointed.And then there's the final twist ending that tries to up the ante from the original film. but with none of its shock value or finesse. It's simply moronic.There is value in this film. If you haven't seen the original film, you'll probably like this one fine. It's not a very clever piece of science fiction, but it's not insultingly stupid either – aside from the ending – and the visuals are good enough to warrant a viewing.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

How wrong I was. With 'Planet of the Apes' Mr T. Burton has produced a movie which is absolutely devoid of characterisation and totally lacking in wit or imagination. The plot holes are so gargantuan that one fears the bored looking cast members may tumble into them never to return. Even Burton's visual panache, the saving grace in such uninvolving one joke efforts as 'Mars attacks', is utterly absent here. This looks exactly like what it is: slapdash, cynical filmmaking of the highest (or lowest) order.Do yourself a favour and go back and revel in the wonderfully unnerving atmosphere of the original. Or better yet watch 'Beetlejuice' and marvel at a talent gone badly, badly awry.","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

He acts the psychopathic homicidal ape perfectly. Even the walk he seems to have perfected. No wonder Quentin Tarantino hires him so much; he works well with twisted characters and plotlines. (Watch Reservoir Dogs if you don't believe me... Mr. Orange)The love triangle of Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) and the blond chick with a big chest [i think she was called Deana] (Estelle Warren), is hilarious. Some critics have said that they wished that Davidson and Ari had more of a relationship instead of the blond chick with a big chest and Davidson. This is totally crazy! Have they SEEN THE MOVIE??? The only thing that blond chick with big chest did was kiss Davidson once and look exactly like a blond chick with big chest. She is a token piece in this movie.... The relationship with Ari and Davidson not only involves a kiss but he saves her life more than once, and they even TALK! I think that some critics need to cut back on their drinking!Speaking of blond chick/big chest being the token piece, she is only in the movie because people expect her. They screwed up the ending, so why keep her? But yet again the adolescent male attitudes that every guy keeps hidden SOMEWHERE rear their ugly heads. Look at most of the movies these days, find one that doesn't have a token chick with a big chest? It doesn't seem well. Natural.Well then, the makeup jobs. INSANE! Each of the prosthetics that the actors wore was individual created. Unlike the original movie, every ape has a different face, which is highly expressive and flexible, Kudos to the makeup crew:Rick Baker,   Brigitte Bugayong,  Gabriel De Cunto, Toni G, Teressa Hill, Jamie Kelman,  Patricia Miller (II),  Denise Paulson, Alex Proctor, Robin SlaterI was highly impressed.The directing was impressive as well, timing the movements and brining a vision to life was left up to Tim Burton and yet again he brings the screen to life. Every scene in the film was well thought out and well held together, this was an impressive feat for a remake.Forgive me but the ending of this movie sucked. I wont say more but it did....

Easy: a bad movie that makes millions of dollars. This movie was awful, no two ways about it. I have the utmost respect for Tim Burton, but that doesn't mean he's incapable of making an absolute garbage film, which is what he did here. The screenplay had all the depth of a fourth grader's story contest submission, stooping so far as to have a character say (and I'm not making this up) ""Can't we all just get along?"" I swear, Paul Giamatti's bad comic relief character was pulled from a thrown-out Disney script. This movie was cliched at its best, at its worst it was painfully stupid. I can't say more without spoiling the ending, but know this: When you're sitting in the theater thinking ""Oh sweet jesus don't let that be the way they're gonna end it,"" stand up and leave, because the ending you dread is the one you get.

Even though I had heard nothing but negative things about this film I went in with an open mind because most of the bad reviews I heard were from die-hard fans of the original but the film turned out to be a major dud. The most shocking thing is that Burton didn't bring any energy or excitement to the film. The first hour drags by so bad that I was having a hard time staying awake. The film picks up during it's final act but even then the battle scenes aren't as good as they should have been. I did like the ending though. Wahlberg sleepwalks through his role but I enjoyed the supporting cast. I thought Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter were very good in their roles and I also enjoyed Michael Clarke Duncan. Kris Kristofferson and Charlton Heston also come off good in their small roles. The screenplay is rather weak and the reworked lines from the original film come off very lame. Burton tries a lot of things in the film but I think he's held back by the PG-13 rating. I think the director should have delivered an R-rated movie and went all out on the various messages that are hinted out throughout the film and made the battle scenes real battle scenes.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Rosenthal put together a movie with too high-brow of a plot for you to understand.  I'm one of the first people to nit pick away at movies for defying the laws of physics and continuity but most of the complaints I've read in the reviews have no basis whatsoever.  You simply didn't understand what you were watching.Now that that's said; Wahlberg's acting skills needed a lot of polishing before trying a role like this.  Granted, we all know he's no Charlton Heston, but come on... he's worse in this movie than most and that's saying something.  Beyond that - and having the lead role that poorly cast does, I'll admit, have a huge impact on the overall movie - it's hard to fault this picture.  The story was a refreshing departure from the original series without being completely foreign and the rest of the acting, special effects and makeup were all wonderfully done.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I honestly am unable to say anything more .If something is to be said is that this film destroyed the reputation of Tim Burton as a great director and from this point on he is but a shadow of his former glory, many actors reputation was stained by that film and it took them years to come back in to the spotlight. However in all this disaster there is one good thing that came out: A guide of how not to make a remake ,which future directors and studios can uses in order to make good films and I believe that it has help ,if the new trilogy of the Planet of the Apes films is any indication.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

A possible reason why the average gun loving movie goer (brainwashed by a war mongering mainstream not-so-thought-out point of view) would not appreciate Tim Burton's vision is the Director's anti-war sentiment that carries a subtle under-tone of acceptance throughout the film. The movie is great-looking. Rick Baker's makeup is convincing even in the extreme closeups, and his apes sparkle with personality and presence. The sets and locations give us a proper sense of alien awe. Tim Burton made a film that's respectful to the original, and respectable in itself.

Equally, I imagine the screenwriters probably did an admirable job with their story. But any hope of a performance by Wahlberg, as anything more than a stereotyped dosage of testosterone, was trashed. It's really a pity. And to think that Tim Burton's name is attached to this film leaves me reeling... Having seen so many of his films and his genius revealed, I cannot help but believe this latest project suffered nuclear fall-out. Just think back: ""Sleepy Hollow"", ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", and so many more: I could just keep writing... They were all fabulous.The most to be said for the end-product is that it allows Wahlberg to be likeable. Tim Roth, on the other hand, comes off so badly that he reminds me of Gary Oldman (whose talent, by the way, is huge and underutilised...) with too much make-up and a bad hangover. Only Helena Bonham-Carter and the special effects (read: Tim Burton) make this film worth seeing. Bonham-Carter is not only likeable, but believable, convincing, and showing real talent despite the obvious handicap of the costume. She really does deserve high marks here, but I don't think the voting public will take the end-product of this film seriously. Again, what a shame... The Marketing Gurus and Editors really need to be strung-up for hacking to bits what could have been fabulous.Entertainment value. Go see it for the special effects and noted items above. Recommend letters of condolence for Wahlberg and Burton; I am ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN this project could have been saved.

Though stranded on a strange world, Leo Davidson lacks the outsider quality of other Burton heroes like Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood, or Lydia Deitz (Beetlejuice).  Similarly the comedy seems wedged in, rather than forming an integral part of the story, as it does in the likes of Mars Attacks or Ed Wood.It is really only the performance of Tim Roth that redeems this picture. He has never really had a reputation for being a physical actor but here he shows himself to be up with the Oldmans and the Nicholsons.  It would have been good to see someone more animated than Mark Wahlberg in the Davidson role.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Apparently, Burton decided to do this commentary at the very last minute, and, have no doubt, the spontaneous accounts from the fevered mind of Tim Burton are something to behold. It truly gives you an idea of the intricacies that went into crafting each scene of this visual feast.Some highlights from the commentary include Burton talking about what it was like to work with real apes. He said, 'you get this weird vibe from having a relationship with apes. There's a definite connection between humans and apes but its weird, so primal, and so shocking.' Burton's comments reminded me of what Michael Aped, director of Gorilla's in the Mist, had said about working with apes. He said there were many times when he thought there was a real person staring at him and when he turned to see who it was, it had been an ape. He said the experience was eerie, yet fascinating.Burton also talked a lot about this idea of his version of Planet of the Apes being a circular thing. About everything coming back to the beginning or the middle or something. I couldn't quite understand fully what he was talking about, however, it reminded me of Joni Mitchell's Circle of Life song. Oh well,...a creative mind like Tim Burtons is not to be completely understood, only enjoyed.Anyway, the movie is great and Tim Burton's commentary makes the DVD spectacular.","21 out of 37 found this helpful.

What's missing is a good storyline, good dialogue or (apart from a few notable exceptions which I will come to later) decent actors. It takes the plot of the original film and ""updates"" it (although why it needed updating, I don't know).Why do I think it is so awful - let's start with the dialogue. From the moment Mark Wahlberg utters the line ""I'm going to get my monkey"" the script is laughable.Now on to the storyline - well as I said, did it need updating? Take the original, add in some human talking (although it was mostly Wahlberg) and a truly cringe making ending and you have the disaster that was this movie.The acting - I've watched a couple of Wahlberg movies now and I really don't rate him. He seems to think a perma frown relays a pensive side and that if he stomps, he will appear powerful. As a main player, he doesn't convince. Tim Roth - love him but overdone. Helena - don't get me started - ape sensitivity, I don't think so! Michael Clarke Duncan - hang your head in shame. And Estella Warren - god love her, she didn't have a chance. She gets so few lines and is blatantly there as eye candy alone.The human characters who deliver the lines don't even have the decency to look embarrassed. The one exception is Kris Kristofferson who I can pass off without comment, mainly because he wisely keeps his mouth shut for most of the time. The ape actors are well hidden and we won't know if they were embarrassed or not - and they should be. I really respect Tim Roth as an actor but this was ape ham that I was watching - overdone evil, a flat performance. The only decent ape performances that I saw were by Paul Giamatti as the slave trader and the brilliant minute or so that Charlton Heston was on the screen.If you choose to watch this movie, remember you will never get the time it took to watch it back.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

Now I've seen it, and I still don't know.  When you remake a movie, it will inevitably invite comparison with the original. You need to bring something new, interesting, and different to it, and most importantly, it helps to know what that something is.  And that is the chief weakness of the new ""Apes"".The original movie had weirdness and originality, plus satiric bite and subtext out the wazoo.  The apes in Burton's movie behave more like real apes, which is neat, but part of the original's charm was that its human-ish apes lent it a surreal ""Twilight Zone"" quality, no surprise given the involvement of Rod Serling.  Plus the original had that ending, which has become a classic cinematic moment.  The new ""Apes"" obviously lacks that dramatic punch, and the makers were wise to alter its premise accordingly. But to what?  The new movie works best as a comic takeoff on the genre (since the original spawned four sequels and an armada of imitators).  It's fun to spot all the references in this movie, both to the ""Planet of the Apes"" series and to other cultural icons.  But the movie fails to keep the satiric edge through the second reel until the bravura, witty finale (which suggests that any sequel might be funnier and better than this one). Otherwise we get a lot of ho-hum posturing and a surprisingly yawn-inducing battle scene.  The movie also leaps over gaps in the plot like a steroid-crazed chimpanzee.  As an example, the hero is confronted by an army of human refugees who have come from all the land to ""see the human who defies the apes.""  That's impressive communication: he'd only escaped the night before.The story is weak and wandering, and the cast isn't up to the task of buoying it.  This is especially true in the pivotal lead character. Charlton Heston's performance in the original was hammy (but admit it now; we love Charlton BECAUSE he's hammy), but his character had fire and emotion.  You could identify with him because he was trapped in an insane situation, and his fear, confusion and rage were palpable to you.  Mark Wahlberg in the new one barely registers.  Wahlberg is not a bad actor, but neither is he a lead actor.  He is subtle, and best when playing quiet supporting characters to more vibrant leads, like in ""Three Kings"" or ""The Corruptor"".  He also has a flair for deadpan satire (he was the best thing in the misfired ""The Big Hit"").  But this is a role that requires less subtlety and more big expressiveness.  Wahlberg comes across not as an ordinary man trapped in a bizarre nightmare out of time, but just befuddled, like a commuter that has gotten off at the wrong stop.  And, just before the big battle, he gives what has to be the least inspiring speech-to-the-troops in film history.  If Marky Mark had been at Valley Forge, we'd all be mailing our tax returns to London.Heston, incidentally, crops up in an in-jokey cameo as the wizened old leader of the apes.  He shows his son Thade (Tim Roth) an ancient pistol which he says is proof of the ingenuity and wickedness of humanity, in one swoop spoofing both his role in the original and his day job as NRA President.  Between this and playing a gun-toting nut job in ""Town and Country"", Heston seems intent on retiring the Good Sport Award for this year.It happens that all the good performances in this movie are among the apes (hmm, maybe they ARE superior).  Roth is magnetic as the power-mad, swaggering Thade, and kudos also to Michael Clarke Duncan as his adjutant, with a booming voice that was made to say things like, ""Bow your heads!"" Estella Warren is very cute in buckskin, but contributes little else to this movie (this is not all her fault; for an ostensible love interest, her character is woefully underwritten).The movie is not all bad; I'd certainly say it's worth seeing.  It has visual flair, there are a lot of funny lines and moments, and the ending is inspired; but as comedy it's too dull, as drama too flat, as allegory too unworkable to rise above the ordinary.  In the ""Apes"" ouevre, I'd place it above ""Escape From..."" and ""Battle For..."", but that's below the level of ringing endorsement.And if you do see it, one last thing to ponder:  Where the hell did the horses come from???","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Summer blockbusters in particular, with their expansive special effects and distracting explosions; often have to be watched at least twice in order to get a clear view.When I first saw Tim Burton's ""reimagining"" of Planet of the Apes (""Reimagining""? Reimagining it as what? A pile of cack?) I was reasonably dumbstruck by the scale and spectacle as to be uncertain exactly what I thought. I had it pegged down as sort-of average, with the possibility of it either being very good in its own right or a soulless, braindead money-maker. Sadly, seen again, it's the latter. By far.Watching it again on video doesn't help either. When a film is so heavily reliant on the big screen then this says a lot about its content. Without the panoramic views, we're forced to concentrate on plot, dialogue and characterisation. Which is unfortunate as there isn't one, it's rubbish, and there isn't any.There are good points: the opening space scenes are beautifully realised, shot with a cinematic grace, and not just computer generated FX thrown in your face. Also, credit must actually be given to the twist ending, which, while it may seem contrived, does credit the audience with some intelligence (the only part of the movie to do so) and is far more faithful to the source novel than any of the 60s/70s Apes movies. And there's also the scary bit that they ripped off from Jaws.Screenwriter Mark Rosenthal pointed out the redundant subtext of the original by noting ""Today, I think we're living in the famous saying, 'The world will end not with a bang, but with a whimper.'"" However, it's unpleasantly ironic to note that since the release of this movie the prospect of nuclear destruction is again a possibility, and the 1968 picture has once again become as relevant as it ever was. Even without this it took pot shots at racism and famine. Burton's view sees it take on only the novel's Gulliver's Travels-style ape/human reversal, with the odd religious musing and little else. So because it has less to say, it's forced to expand those issues, and basically beat you over the head with them for two hours. Every single line Helena Bonham Carter has is a corny platitude, while I almost heaved my guts at the moment where Wahlberg claims ""sometimes even a few can make a difference"", to the tune of a full-blown orchestra. Yes, the dialogue is the weakest element all right, and while the originals could be a little hammy, this one makes them look like Shakespeare. There's not one exchange approaching a genuine conversation throughout, and the trademark warmth and charm of the original is blown wide apart by a breakneck pace and one-dimensional caricatures. There's no time to react to anything, yet despite the pace, I also found myself looking at my watch several times in boredom.One bit of merchandise I got my hands on was ""Leo's Logbook"", a child-orientated intro to the series with lots of glossy photos. A short affair with just a few words here and there, it lasted less than 30 pages, though told me more about the characters and their backgrounds than the film itself did. Surely that's wrong somehow? In the 1968 film we learn that Charlton Heston's Taylor has both liberal values and is embittered, both within the first five minutes. These contrasting character traits forge three-dimensionality, yet we never get to know or care about Wahlberg's desperately underwritten Leo. Little is known about him from the movie, he's just a bland nobody with a bizarre chimp fetish and nothing else. Maybe it's that he's too young, too ""pop"" to really work in the expected way. Yet look at how we're supposed to believe that Carter's chimp wants a romantic involvement with Wahlberg, and that the Nova replacement is jealous... yet neither of them have exchanged more than a few words with him the whole time. Bonham-Carter (is it just me or does she remind you of Lisa Minelli?) seems ten times more irritating than I remembered, and the sexy but dull Estella Warren fails to make an impact also. I won't even mention the comedy Orang-U-Tang (the ""comedy"" tag a misnomer, of course) or the obligatory irritating brat.What's worse, rather than condemning humanity as the original franchise did, this movie seems to exonerate it. No longer are they the mute ancestors of their own destruction, but  in a very Hollywood decision  the all-speaking, innocent victims of fate. That the apes are reworked as mediaeval, right-wing sadists is also a character-lessening development, and makes Bonham-Carter's role as the sole liberal even more unlikely. Warren heads the batch of human slaves, proving that even in the wild there's still room for lipstick and mascara, if not Imac.And what of Tim Roth? Roth's a good actor, and his performance cannot be faulted. But, sadly, the character is one note throughout. Whether he's holding his dying father's hand or just having dinner, he spends the entire time angry. That's right... he keeps going ape-sh*t! Even when he meets the chimp prophet, he smacks it across some caves. Maybe that's why he's so tense all the time... he needed to spank his monkey! Tee-hee! It's violent, too. I'm not against violence, but this is just ugly, repetitive violence. Violence that only exists because there's nothing else to fill the film. I didn't remember it being so brash before, either: it seems less a coherent story, more one never-ending cacophony of noise.Two quotes from screenwriter Rosenthal, talking to magazine SFX: ""the thing was given its start date and its release date before the director thought he was conceptually there; before the script was ready."" ""the post production on this is probably three times faster than it should have been. I think that making a film at this speeds mean that there is no time for reflection."" Doesn't that say it all? Tim Burton is said to be a huge fan of the Apes movies. Maybe that's why he made this: so that Battle no longer carries the title of worst Planet of the Apes movie. If that's the case then it's a job well done. 4/10.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

Schaffner rendition . It deals with an Air Force astronaut , Captain Leo Davison ( Mark Wahlberg) crashes lands on a mysterious planet where evolved, talking apes dominant a race of primitive humans . As he encounters a culture where the simians rule over humans . Later on , he discovers humanity has gone awry and now is slave and reduced to beasts . Man is treated as animal of burden and regarded as scum . He escapes , being accompanied by a gorgeous native (Estella Warren) and with the help of a sympathetic chimpanzee activist named Ari (Helna Boham Carter) and a small band of human rebels (Eric Avari , Kris Kristofferson) . Leo leads the effort to evade the advancing Simian Army led by brutal General Thade (Tim Roth) and his most brave commandant Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan) . Now humans and simians are on to reach a dark secret within the Forbidden Zone .This is a retelling from classic and energetic science-fiction movie with metaphysical significance and reflexion about origin of human being, though also packs action, adventures , intrigue , satisfying brisk pace and entertainment . This known story provides full of sour and intelligent references to first adaptation but doesn't have its sense of political commentary , neither sociological implications . The picture delivers enough energy and results to be a passable flick full of action , battles and suspense ; however it is light-years ahead of original . Mark Wahlberg as an action man takes the Charlton Heston character but without his charisma , neither impressive screen presence . Tim Roth stands out as a furious militarist with loathing for all human beings . Helena Bonham Carter excels as a clever as well as sensitive simian . Remaining cast formed by enjoyable players playing as Gorilla , Chimpanzees , Orangutans and other apes are nice . Superb makeup courtesy of Rick Baker creates realistic pseudo-simians of Paul Giamatti , Michael Clarke Duncan , David Warner , Chris Ellis , Lisa Marie , Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa, and even Charlton Heston who appears as an old primate , a feeling homage to classic flick in which gave one of his more plausible acting . One of the important attributes of this work, is the magnificent and colorful cinematography by Philippe Rousselot . Epic as well as emotive musical score by Danny Elffman , it's full of fury and sound .The motion picture was professionally directed by Tim Burton , using a great visual sense but with no originality . Other adaptations based on the characters created by Pierre Boulle are the followings : The original and the best is ¨Planet of Apes¨ by Franklyn J Schaffner with Charlton Heston , Roddy MacDowall, Kim Hunter , ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" (1970) by Ted Post with James Franciscus , Linda Harrison , Maurice Evans ; it's followed by three inferior sequels that get worse and a TV series , such as 'Escape of planet of apes'(71, Don Taylor), 'Conquest of planet of apes'(72, J. Lee Thompson), 'Battle for the planet of apes' (73, J.Lee Thompson) . And recently , ¨Rise of the Planet of the Apes¨ (2011) by Rupert Wyatt with James Franco , John Lightow , Freida Pinto , Andy Serkis and preparing ¨Dawn of the Planet of Apes¨ (2013-2014) by Matt Reeves with Judy Greer , Gary Oldman , Keri Russell and Jason Clarke .","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

In this one Mark Wahlberg takes over the Charlton Heston role.  He's trapped on a planet (not Earth of the future as in the original) where apes rule over humans.  He tries to find a way home.The visuals are impressive--visually Burton knows how to direct. Unfortunately, he's never been very good with scripts and actors. That is painfully clear here.  The script moves slowly and the dialogue is comic book level.  The acting is pretty bad too with the sole exception of Helena Bonham Carter as a kind scientist ape.  Tim Roth as an evil ape scowls all the time and throws tantrums--it's not funny or cute or scary--just dull. And Wahlberg is truly terrible in the lead.  His character is so passive and accepting--a total wimp.  At least Heston's character in the original had some edge--Wahlberg has nothing.The makeup on the apes is good, a definitive improvement over the original. Also there's a good score by Danny Elfman and a terrific battle sequence at the end, but it's too little too late.  So, I give it a 6 for the visuals, Carter and the score.  Also the new ending is really really bad.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

It tells the story of astronaut Leo Davidson crash-landing on a planet inhabited by intelligent apes. The apes treat humans as slaves, but with the help of an ape named Ari, Leo starts a rebellion. The film also stars Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, and Estella WarrenDevelopment for a Planet of the Apes remake started as far back as 1988 with Adam Rifkin. His project nearly reached the pre-production stage before being canceled. Terry Hayes's script, titled Return of the Apes, would have starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, under the direction of Phillip Noyce. Oliver Stone, Don Murphy, and Jane Hamsher were set to produce. Creative differences ensued between Hayes and financier/distributor 20th Century Fox. Chris Columbus, Sam Hamm, James Cameron, Peter Jackson, and the Hughes brothers later became involved.With William Broyles, Jr.'s script, Tim Burton was hired as director, and the film was put into active development. Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal rewrote the script, and filming took place from November 2000 to April 2001. Planet of the Apes was released to mixed reviews, but was a financial success. Much criticism focused on the confusing plot and ending, although Rick Baker's prosthetic makeup designs were praised.The story is a little confusing, but it is easy to look at for me, but for everyone else, a lot of people and critics and also fans of the franchise hates this story and the ending. The ending is just confusing also, but it's easy to overlook these two major flaws.The music by Danny Elfman is just awesome and the song that plays during the end credits titled, ""Rule the Planet Remix"" is awesome, mixed by Paul Oakenfold and composed by Danny Elfman. The rest of the music including the opening theme music is just spectacular and the film does wonders with the music.The visual effects and makeup is just spectacular also, but Rick Baker did the prosthetic make-up effects for the apes and it is a blessing of him. The visuals are a little cheesy, but works for this type of movie.The acting, is just good and bad. The only credit that will be given to is Mark Wahlberg, his performance as the lead was amazing. Helena Bonham Carter, Estella Warren and Michael Clarke Duncan puts on really good performances as well, but they can get way too over-the- top in some of the scenes. Paul Giamatti is hilarious and he does an amazing job. Luke Eberl and Erick Avari is in the film, too, but they're performances were a little confusing. Charlton Heston has a cameo as Thade's dad. Tim Roth plays the villain, Thade and he is okay, but even then, he is over-the-top as well.Overall, with the 2001 remake of Planet of the Apes, it's not a bad re-imagining, but it could have done much better than this. I like and hate this remake of the 1968 original classic.Despite its financial success, 20th Century Fox chose not to produce a sequel, and later rebooted the franchise in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of the Apes.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

For farms, monkeys were trained to fly small space capsules recognition not to expose humans in danger and the unknown chimpanzee Pericles ends up being swallowed by a temporal rift in space. To investigate an electromagnetic storm and recover your trained monkey who had not returned to the ship, Leo, opposing his fellow ship enters a small ship and goes to rescue him. But Leo has an accident and ends up landing on a primitive planet and dangerous primates where tyrants and intelligent speakers that form the local, enslave humans who are mistreated and treated like wild animals. Leo ends up being captured as you arrive on the planet along with a group trying to escape, and after the initial shock and disgusted with the way humans are treated, he plans a social revolution on the planet and becomes a threat to primates. Aided by Ari monkey, human rights advocate and a veteran former Army Military ape, deposed by dishonestly fearsome General Thade, a chimpanzee who hates humans and violently defends his extermination of the planet, Leo and a group of humans will try escaping the place.The criticisms made in Pierre Boulle's book and which are on a smaller scale or do not exist in the two adaptations for the cinema are many and well punctuated, such as, for example, the way man treats animals and acts as the owner of the planet Earth and everything in it is criticized with the reversal of roles. And because monkeys are the target of experiments and resemble humans, they explain their choice to stay in our place. The common laboratory tests are also applied by primates, who dissect their brains, observe their behavior in captivity, and do all kinds of tests. Some primates are disgusted by humans by treating them as simple animals. This could certainly be inserted in the films. It would certainly shock the audience in surreal and impressive scenes. Through these same surveys carried out by the apes, the same curiosity that we have to know about life on other planets through research is evident.The organization in society of monkeys is also very similar to that of humans. They are divided into three different varieties: that of the chimpanzees, that of the gorillas and that of the orangutans, where each group has its characteristics and purposes. Even though peace and equality have been decreed between them, the ""differences"" still exist.Another issue addressed is humanization, at least how we treat this issue in the sense of being civilized. The book is approached through some characters on the planet of the monkeys, where one of them resists instincts and struggles to be recognized as being logical and thinking and the other undergoes a curious process of dehumanization. This issue could also be better addressed in the films.In this version of Burton, there were also some adaptations in the script in relation to the book and the original film, starting with the change of names of the characters and the fact that Leo fell alone on the planet and not with his companions. Monkey society and buildings are better developed. Humans can speak, walk dressed and not naked as described in the book for obvious reasons, and are used as servants or pets of monkeys. Firearms were replaced by spears and swords. Not to mention the evolution in the physical part of the monkeys, now they are no longer people with ape heads and start convincing like real monkeys, being differentiated by races and characteristics, chimpanzees are faster, gorillas are heavier and slower etc. . All this thanks to the fantastic special effects and the makeup artist Rick Baker, an incredible professional who is also behind classics like An American Werewolf in London and The Grinch. Unfortunately, the film was wronged at the Oscars and other awards for makeup. Some actors took two to three hours on average to become monkeys. But the result is chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas with human faces.Another different factor in this version is that the monkeys of the 70s were more peaceful and similar to humans in their attitudes as well as in the book. Here, monkeys are extremely agile, violent and scary, that growl all the time and that jump and run in an incredible way, more like the reality of these animals. This caused the monkeys of the 70s to be far surpassed by the monkeys of Burton. Also impressive is the attitude of the new monkeys in the way of walking and expressing their characteristic attitudes. Furthermore, in the book, society seems more advanced and in this version of 2001 with more resources, this can be evidenced better.After problems with the delay in hiring a director for the film, fans of the ape series were reassured by knowing what hands the project would be in. Burton did seem to be an obvious choice after all, despite not being one of the first candidates for the job. He certainly better than anyone would be able to explore the conflict between humans and monkeys well, as well as, as expected, be able to use all his known visual competence in the composition of the work. Burton chose to show apes at a similar evolutionary stage, but a little higher than that of classic films. Of course, with the generous amount released by Fox, Burton and his excellent art direction team have achieved far more impressive results than before. To begin with, the makeup is detailed, organic and much more natural and, at the same time, much more complete than those simian masks that drowned out the voices and features of the actors, although for the end of the 60s and the mid 70, they were extraordinary.Undoubtedly, his vision in creating the planet that gives the work its title is in the best Burton style, having seen in his several fantastic works before and after this project. The settings are grand, with a primitive and rustic texture, a dry climate and above all dark, inviting and intriguing. Most of the scenes take place in the dry ""Zona Proibidia"" where the Oberon space station is found, and in indoor and night scenes, giving a more tense and sinister atmosphere many times. A caveat is that although Burton managed to print his authorial style especially in the graphic motto of the work, it is clear that he ends up being stuck in the not-so-deep script, which accelerated the pace many times in favor of the action scenes rather than in the ideologies and criticisms that were not so explicit.The cast is cohesive and does not at any time compromise the greater realism given to a fiction. Mark Wahlberg as the revolutionary, Tim Roth composing the cruel and ambitious General Thade, Helena Bonham Carter as the rebel Ari, Michael Clarke Duncan as the strong Attar, Paul Giamatti as the comic Limbo, in addition to the participation of Kris Kristofferson as Karubi. paper. Technically, I highlight the soundtrack of the always competent Danny Elfman, Burton's longtime partner, in addition to the impeccable photography by Philippe Rousselot, which deserves applause.Also noteworthy is the scene that pays tribute to Charlton Heston, playing General Thade's father at one point. He saying the last sentence said to General Thade before he died, ""Damn you! May they all be condemned to hell !, it was the same used in the original but when he referred to humanity, as a self-destructive and threatening race after unraveling the mystery of the last scenes. In fact, this scene was marked in the history of cinema, in which the astronaut George Taylor managed to escape from the tyranny of monkeys and fleeing by the shore of a beach in the ""Forbidden Zone"", he ended up finding the ruins of the American ""Statue of Liberty"", discovering he was in reality in the distant future of planet Earth itself, destroyed by the human race in a nuclear war, and which was now dominated by monkeys. In fact, the 68 film is one of the few films in history that deliver the ending already on its poster, although we only notice this at the end of the projection, but for the most attentive, it is a serious mistake of the distributor that seems not to have seen the film before releasing it.The big problem that made the film not become a success as it happened with the first ones, was that the essence of the Planet of the Apes written by Pierre Boulle, from which the film was adapted, was not present during the narrative. The Planet of the Apes of 1968, for example, is faithful to the book and shows itself to be full of intelligent dialogues, which carry social, theological and political criticisms. There is an intellectual dispute, while the 2001 remake bet only on the war between monkeys and men and departs from the true proposal of Boulle's dystopia. Plot Twist is maintained, but it happens in a different way than seen before and it can be interesting even for those who already knew the outcome of the plot, thanks to well-used elements of science fiction. In fact, the final plot twist, without a doubt, does not have the same impact as the 68 film.Overall, Burton delivers a more commercial film, one of the most commercial of his career, bringing more action than the original half-stopped movie. But that does not mean that this posture is all bad. Undoubtedly the franchise has been reinvigorated with new elements and does not deserve the most exalted criticism from some who even abhor this version of 2001. They are different versions and present their variations in language and technology. This can be considered an alternative version with the same argument, with interesting differences and fictional alternatives, leading the audience to reflect and travel on new horizons, all within the most dark and peculiar world of Tim Burton, making this film a great science fiction .","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Didn`t he realise that in the original apes were split into differing castes down to their species ? Here we see an ape army composed of all types of apes.Why ? I have no idea . And worst of all gone is the mystery and other worldliness of the original. Remember the scenes where the Earth astronauts trek through the forbidden zone and the first appearance of the apes  or that final scene ? In the remake we have no similar impact.There`s a rumour that there might be a sequel in the pipeline. I hope not","3 out of 23 found this helpful.

Burton keeps the viewer nailed down and anxious to see what lies ahead.Tim Roth could very well be in award-contention for his no-holds-barred representation of a human-hater.  His speech, walk, even his eye movements completely transform him into a vicious ape.  Hats off to an actor of his caliber.  Wahlberg is good, as well.  He is the typical 'boy-next door' American whom is smart enough to not ask questions while he secretly plans his escape.  Kristofferson's cameo is nearly non-existant, however. Development of the human tribes and their ways of life would be interesing to learn of, but action wins over plot thickness.  Estella Warren is simply eye-candy, while Bonham Carter is the lead female with a brain to match.The film is fast paced, and at a few moments seemed to be out of control. Not Burton's best work personally, but working with an ensemble of terrific makeup artists, photograhphers, and Elfman (with a terrific score), it is tied together nicely.","17 out of 29 found this helpful.

Davidson plans to lead a rebellion and prevent the war hungry apes from wiping out the human population.In the summer of 2001 many films were released that were heavily hyped and were meant to be fantastic.  The vast majority of them were poor  even without the disappointment from the hyping, they were still poor.  The remake of Planet of the Apes stands out as one of the biggest letdowns to me.  The plot has been changed slightly but the bones of it remains the same.  However we have already seen the monkey/human role reversal done before and that isn't gone into in very much detail here, opting instead for more action and drama.The main changes are superficial  the monkey makeup is better of course and the gorillas move very fast and with the agility you'd expect from them rather than moving like humans.  However this a great film does not make and all it served to do was to remind me how much better the original was. Wahlberg is OK in the lead and Roth is fantastically nasty but other than that the casting is either OK or just poor.  Duncan is OK, Carter is iffy and comic relief Giamitti is misfiring the whole way.  Heston's cameo is good and is actually quite funny but stands out a lot more than I suspect it was meant to.Overall this is hugely disappointing and will likely not spawn a sequel that relates directly to this film (if at all).  If you have to watch one movie that has humans being ruled over by monkeys then I suggest the original is a much better option.  Oh, and don't get me started on the ending!  It would be powerful if it made ANY sense at all, again, it just made me think how good the original was.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

His style is missing. ** (out of four).","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512077/?ref_=tt_urv","Movie-12","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0111563/?ref_=tt_urv","4 August 2001","PLANET OF THE APES / (2001) ** (out of four)By Blake French:	""Planet of the Apes"" is a $100 million remake that makes its points so many times that we eventually stop caring and begin to lose interest. The film is well made and has a lot of interesting material, but it's been done before, and we don't need five or six examples of grizzly apes abusing humans just to prove the fact that apes treat humans harshly. ""Planet of the Apes"" quickly becomes redundant and outstays its welcome. The production turns into a  tool to impress us with the amazing set pieces and dazzling make up effects. This movie is a waste of the talents of director Tim Burton.
	The year is 2029. An astronaut named Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) lives on a large United States Air Force space station that contains a large selection of apes used for space exploration. One of his beloved apes gets launched into spacebut something goes wrong. He decides to go against the captain's orders and take a ride on a small space pod to rescue the animal and explore the unknown territory himself. Again, something goes wrong.
	What kind of scientist would launch himself into some unknown abyss in space when an experiment just proved the area dangerous? Leo must be suicidal, stupid, or both. Anyway, he finds himself stuck in some kind of time warp that blasts him into the future on a mysterious planet where talking apes control the world and humans live in cages.
He meets several resident humans there, like Karubi (Kris Kristofferson), and his grown daughter Daena (Estella Warren). They are captured by military forces and delivered to a human slave trading ape named Limbo (Paul Giamatti). Leo has a difficult time understanding this world, but luckily, there is an ape who shows compassion towards humans. Her name is Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), and we are not surprised when she offers Leo and his fellow humans a chance to escape from the planet of the apes.
	 Although none of these characters are particularly memorable, one stands out in my mind as an absolute nuisance: General Thade (Tim Roth), the planet's head military leader. He isn't scary, shocking, or disturbing, just really, really unpleasant. Tim Roth, a good actor, goes way over the top with this simple-minded character-to the point where I hated him. Not because he's the villain, but because his screen presence is irksome. It's just an unpleasant performance for an unpleasantly stupid character.
	Something about the time frame doesn't seem right. Let's examine this: Leo jumps into the future, where apes rule the planet. Once on the planet, he discovers his old space crew came to rescue him and crashed. This is where the apes become out of control, and take over the planet. Good insight there. But the crew crash landed on the planet thousands of years earlier, according to a character in the movie. Leo has only been on the planet for days. Hmmmm. Something here just doesn't add up. I guess I am thinking too hard  for a movie that isn't supposed to make you think that much. If you can clear this up for me, please drop me a line. It'll be much appreciated and save many hours of sleep that would otherwise be spent wondering about this. There is something else that bothers me about ""Planet of the Apes."" The make up effects are stunning-so good that I could not tell who the actor was under the ape makeup and costume. So here's my question: why spend millions of dollars on big name actors like Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Helena Bonham Carter when you're going to smoother them in make up beyond recognition? The actor could have been my neighbor for all that I knew. The filmmakers might have liked the voices and energy of the actors, I guess.
I give the movie credit for making us care about the humans. By the end, during an involving and intense war sequence between human and ape-kind, I was definitely rooting for the humans. I also liked the way it reveals the plot. But ""Planet of the Apes"" could have been so much more. Tim Burton's style isn't obvious here, either. He does inject a convincing and masterfully crafted atmosphere, but it doesn't entrance us like ""Batman,"" ""Edward Scissorhands,"" or ""Sleepy Hollow."" It think that's because the movie concentrates so hard on the plot and special effects, it never relaxes and explores such themes as isolation, loneliness, or racism. ""Plant of the Apes""  is a wasted opportunity.","17 out of 37 found this helpful.

But much of the script seemed to be on auto-pilot, as if the prologue was rushed through because everyone knew the main character was going to end up on, well, the Planet of the Apes and so they went through the plot contrivances as quickly as possible.  And then there is the twist at the end, about which I will say nothing other than I didn't see it coming because it makes NO SENSE AT ALL!  I of course cannot explain why without giving it away, but trust me, it was a major let-down to have a well made film end with that nonsense.  All in all I do mildly recommend the film; it is one of the better summer releases I've seen this year, second only to Apocalypse Now.  But maybe that just goes to show what a weak summer it has been.PS  In the film there is a female character on the space station with the name tag ""Alexander"", but IMDB lists no character with that name.

Director Tim Burton's update of Planet of the Apes is here. Is it as good as the 1968 version? Is Charlton Heston likely to support gun control laws? No, of course not. But, that's hardly the point.A clever screenplay by Rod Serling, engaging performances and John Chambers' groundbreaking make-up - the original Apes is a sci-fi classic. However, Director Franklin Schaffner's visualization of  writer Pierre Boulle's source material works on  levels beyond simple aesthetics.In the late sixties, society takes a stumble. Civil unrest, Vietnam and the counter-culture - wow, man . . . the times, they are changing.Enter a film about a white, male astronaut (Heston). Marooned on a strange planet,  Col. Taylor  is not a happy man. In fact, he spends much of his time criticizing the arrogance of mankind. This guy makes the rock band Radiohead seem upbeat and optimistic.He encounters a group of primal, uncivilized humans. However, much to Taylor's astonishment,  talking apes are the dominant species on this world. Confronted with a new social order, Heston yells, : `It's a madhouse, a madhouse.'In one of cinema's most brilliant twist-endings, Taylor learns that he is not far from home. Furthermore, man's own worst enemy is himself.Timing is everything . . . The first P.O.T.A finds an audience because it explores themes pertinent to a volatile era of activism and transformation. The movie casts a long shadow.The 1968 film is  iconic. It transcends the medium and holds a place in our pop culture collective. Burton can't remake the original and hope for the same level of success.The  filmmaker (Ed Wood and Sleepy Hollow)understands that point. So, he doesn't try. Instead, Burton and company re-invent Apes from a different perspective.This time around, Mark Wahlberg crashes on an ape-ruled planet. Faster than Curious George can get into trouble, a primate patrol captures the new arrival. After being sold into slavery, he befriends a left-leaning, pro-human chimpanzee played by Helena Bonham Carter. Along with a group of fugitive homosapiens, Wahlberg's band must elude the tyrannical military leader, Thade (Tim Roth) and flee to safety.Burton's Apes has a quirky tone. The movie isn't as substantial as the earlier incarnation - but, it is entertaining. Take a cameo by Heston. As Roth's dying father, he playfully re-visits dialogue from the first film. Given Heston's political convictions, his anti-gun rant is deliciously ironic. Remember, he's the guy  who  defiantly announces before  National Rifle Association meetings: `You can have my gun, when you pry it from my cold, dead paws.' Calm down, Moses.Make-up specialist, Rick Baker, supplies the latex for the simian characters. This guy has more Oscars than NSYNC has bad songs for good reason. Baker gives each ape its own incredibly detailed look. In a distinguished career, this film is his best work.Still, even more impressive are the actors within the monkey suits. The way Bonham Carter, Roth and their fellow contemporaries totally transform themselves with body movements, ticks and facial expressions  is outstanding.Burton gleefully turns his primates loose - letting them bound across the screen, arms flailing and voices screeching. These factors give Planet of the Apes a manic energy.Although, the movie suffers when the action shifts to the human contingent. Wahlberg is acceptable as the lead. He is distant. Still, his spaceman realizes the absurdity of his situation and just wants out. Wahlberg's detachment is an interesting counterpoint to the ape's dynamism. However, the emerging star's dour delivery does overstay its welcome by the third act.The remaining humans are sadly underdeveloped. They are bland and boring. I've seen more exciting people at Republican nominating conventions.Burton ends the film with an obligatory surprise finale. The closer is hysterical. It is more abstract than the original's final scene. But, if you take the time to piece it together, the conclusion makes perfect sense.What else could Burton do? Audience expectations are high for a shocking last act. At least he answers the call with good-natured playfulness.The new Planet of the Apes is a mixed bag. It's inventive and exciting -humorous, not campy. No, it's not the 1968 version. Who cares? Burton's movie stands on its own merits.  Still, Apes is lacking in just enough areas to hold it back.  Oh, well - better luck in the sequel.This film is a six out of ten.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

There's no logic at all.  There are two things that are out of logic: the human sensations, and fictious stories.  I thought the only logical explanation for this story is that it's a dream.  Another explanation is that the astronaut is travelling through space-time.  But the first unlogical thing is that the Apes are speaking English(well, this is the only language they can say to show to American audiences). Well, the ending(I'm addicted to talk about endings of movies), is quite unexpected.  And it quite supports the explanation of the astronaut travelling through space-time. Okay, don't talk about the logic thing, I think this is rather a fable, to put human into an inferior position how they often treat animals.  Well, anyway, I don't think this fable thing, is quite relevant to the current world, so to speak.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie came on TV, non letterbox, not that it would matter for the piece of junk it is. Bland story, uninteresting characters....oh what a waste of time. I got about 50% of the way through, then realized I had much better things to do and wasn't going to waste my time. So I did jump to the last 10-15 minutes to catch the infamous ending. The worst Burton film of all time. He doesn't have anything close to the wretchedness of this film. Thank goodness! He's one of my all time favorites.

For costumes and decoration, I find it's very beautiful decorations that he are like a real future if possible. They are very odd culture of the monkeys. They are good a color!!! I see the costumes are beautiful too!!! It's gone in film! For the actors and the actresses, Mark is cool. to play the perfect role of Leo. He is a good actor. For Tim Roth, it is played a good role of malicious!!! It's excel!!! For Helena, it is actress a little as in the film Club Fight. For Michael Clarke Duncan, it is the role of large gorilla!! It gives me fear. The others of the monkeys are differences the characters in the village. They are special culture.
I believe that Burton is a good spirit! Congratulated!!!Finally, I'm talking about my comments of costumes and decoration and actors and actresses. I hope which the film is still a sequel film of planet of the apes in Washington D.C. with the director Tim Burton and the actor Mark.","18 out of 32 found this helpful.

They're good outside of the ape suits but within them, they are transformed into sci-fi Gods. If not for them, the movie would be a B flick.

But, it surely was not worthy of a remake, revisioning, or regurgitation.What is most disturbing about this movie is how slow and illogical it is. It plods along through scenes with very little energy. I kept thinking about how hot everybody must have been in those monkey outfits. There are points where Mark Walburg does the most illogical and pointless things. For example - why doesn't he ever talk! I mean if strange animals were locking me up AND they happened to also speak my language, I would make every effort to reason with them. But Mark just stands there .... duhhhh. When he finally gets a gun - which could flatten the apes does he protect it with his life - heck no. Another ape grabs it from him and breaks it.And the woman with the overly red pouty lips. What the hell was she doing there other than looking pretty? Her role has no purpose whatsoever other than somebody who can receive the animalistic affections of Mark.
This is a pathetically bad movie. Worse than I even expected. I had real high hopes for this before it came out. I was really looking forward to seeing it.

What is more, you can easily realize, that this is not an own fiction.

The movie easily bleeds because of its narrative weakness and its forced final twist. It has also a great rhythm and spectacular action moments, by far the best, however it sinks rapidly not only because the relations between characters are a kind of childish, but also because of its sense of humor.

It's just a good, exciting science fiction adventure film, and on that level, it succeeds quite well with only a few small stumbles.Tim Burton remains the only director I can name who has never made a film I don't like.  You might call me biased, but I do go into every new Burton film afraid that this will be the one.  Fortunately, I'm still waiting.So why is this not a remake?  Well, there are no characters from the original story (either the novel OR the film), and the situation is significantly altered.  While still being the story of an astronaut who lands in a strange new ape-dominated world, very little else is the same. Only a few lines of dialogue intended to evoke the 1968 film remind us.What's good?  First, of course, is Rick Baker's absolutely astounding makeup.  The original appliances still stand up quite well, so this was a nightmare assignment for any makeup artist.  Baker is one of the very few who could handle it, and handle it he does.  There has never been such amazingly detailed, expressive work in the history of film; the actors are able to come right through the latex and hair.  Too much praise cannot be heaped upon his work.  Then there's the patented Tim Burton visual approach; this is easily his best-looking film since ""Edward Scissorhands"", and really helps to lend the proceedings an otherworldly appearance.  The acting from the performers in the roles of apes is uniformly excellent, particularly Tim Roth in one of the most frightening villain roles I've seen in years.  He truly gives the impression of being dangerously unpredictable; a genuinely great movie psycho.  Mention must also be made of Danny Elfman's score, his most dynamic and interesting in years.  It recalls Goldsmith's work just enough to remind us of what we're watching, while also moving into new territory.What doesn't work?  Well, the humans.  They talk, but have nothing of consequence to say.  Why is Estella Warren so much cleaner than everyone else, and where did she get that lipstick?  And if she's intended to be a love interest for Wahlberg, shouldn't they have a conversation or two?  And sadly, we're given only the barest peek at the ape society before our heroes escape and return to the wilderness.  I really would like to have seen more of their culture.Now, the ending has already become much-debated and argued over across the Internet and elsewhere.  First off, I like the ending.  While it may not have quite the punch of the original's, I think it's a good twist for those going in expecting a twist (and weren't we all?).  Without revealing too much, let's just say that the screenwriters have obviously read the novel.In conclusion, this is an entertaining and exciting sci-fi adventure.  It won't open up your mind much, and it may not be among Burton's best works, but it's a lot of fun, and has a great deal to admire.  7 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is Tim Burton-lite, and as easily distinguishable as his prior films are, it's disheartening to see that he clearly gave in to Hollywood blockbuster mentality, as Planet bears no sign of his signature dark style.Planet of  The Apes is loosely based on its predecessor.  Mark Whalberg (here a cardboard cut-out action hero) stars as an astronaut who gets sucked into a time warp (?) and finds himself crash landing on a planet and captured by talking apes who have created a society where humans are their servants.  He finds a friend in female ape Helen Bonham Carter. The rest of the movie follows our hero Whalberg as he attempts to escape from his captors, in particular a nasty General played by an unrecognizable Tim Roth.The story is hardly noteworthy.  It's merely a clothesline on which to hang a few charged action sequences, grandiose sets, and the human actors eluding their captors.  What made the classic so striking was its scenes of the apes treating the humans as livestock.  Here, director Tim Burton has instead chosen to eschew characters and rely on the quality of the first film to garner any sort of sympathy for his characters.  The only likeable characters are, again, Helen Bonham Carter as an ape who sympathizes with and wants to help the humans, and Paul Giamatti, as a wise-cracking ape who by the end becomes very grating with his one-liners.The only true innovation in this updated version is the makeup; it's light years ahead of the 1968 version, and the actors disappear behind it, as well as the militarized costumes.  The apes look more ferocious, but this is a very poor substitute for an actual story.  Even the action sequences are dumbed down, with bullets and spears flying, there is no blood onscreen whatsoever.  Was it the studios who persisted in Burton to not show blood? Sleepy Hollow was a gorefest, but I imagine since this is a huge studio summer blockbuster, all controversial images and language were censored in order to have a more family oriented (money-making) movie.With all its flaws, Planet of the Apes is made watchable thanks to the amazing makeup and the performances from Roth and Bonham-Carter.  Perhaps Tim Burton will push the envelope with his next film, as here his influence seems nonexistent, except for the dark ending bound to leave audiences looking for a total mindless summer film confused.6 out of 10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In fact the only film that I enjoy of his is when he actually deviates from his usual style(Ed Wood). The irony lies in the fact that the film is about arguably the worst director of all time. He totally crapped up what could have been a great Batman movie and did the same thing with Planet of the Apes. The plot was such a snorer as it trudges along in a uneven pace. It leaves me to wonder,did he ended it so crappy as to not want to make a sequel? I anticipated the release of this film for so long and when I threw away my eight dollars and fifty cents to see it on opening night i wanted to send my bill to Burton. GOD!!

The end was a great twist and lent a smile to my face.  You people that hate the end, too bad. There's nothing you can do to change it, so live with it and take it for what it is, Tim Burton's sense of humor shining through. The screen play by William J. Broyles and others was fabulous, and who can say more than ""The Oscar goes too...Rick Baker for Planet Of The Apes""?  Burton delivers his usual chuzpah in his own dark and twisted way, and his long time friend, Danny Elfman delivers one of his best scores ever.  If you are looking for true summer escapist fun, Planet of the Apes rules.  So, grab some popcorn and a banana and be prepared to have fun.","16 out of 28 found this helpful.

The answer of course is that people always do remakes of good movies. They really should be doing remakes of bad movies, they are ones that need it.And there is no better example of the above then The Planet of the Apes, a movie that is such a pale imitation of the original that I was angry at myself for paying $4 to see it.Tim Burton is a very good director, I'm usually a fan of his work.  But, with this movie he seems to have gotten so caught up with turning actors into monkeys that he lost sight everything else.  The movie has great makeup, but no soul.  It just reeks of being a directors vanity project. This movie far surpasses the original in it presentation of the monkey planet, i.e. make-up, effects, acting, yet is less believeable.Burton also seems to have been so consumed with his monkey cast, he forgot his humans.  It can not go unmentioned how insipid Mark Wahlberg is movie. A potted plant would have held my attention as much as he did.And finally, nothing illustrates the futility of trying to remake this movie then the ""surprise ending"".  Obviously, he couldn't do the same ending as the original, it wouldn't be a surprise.  So it became necessary to come up with something totally different, but would still have the power and impact of the original.  Well, I guess they couldn't think anything so they decided to go with nonsensical instead.  Yes folks, the big surprise is that the movie's ending MAKE NO SENSE!!!

He manages to make a film that will not offend the traditionalists who enjoyed the original (like me), while at the same time creating something new that audiences of today will appreciate.First and foremost, this movie looks great. Even if all other components of the movie were weak (and some are), I would still be partial to this picture. The costumes, makeup, and sets are rich and extremely authentic-appearing, and really bring to life the apes and their culture. In a movie about a different culture, this is important. (There is by no means a comprehensive vision of a simian society, but enough is touched on to give us a good taste.) Without giving away the finer details, the plot is equal to the original, and the same interesting philosophical qualities of the 1968 version are here, with the social commentary on animal treatment, tensions in communities over diversity, the place of religion within the state, etc. There is enough action to make things interesting on a primal level (the initial capture scene is much more intense in the new Apes, the apes themselves being much more intimidating), and some personal relationships also add an element to the story.Even though many of the actors are covered in convincing makeup (with the possible exception of Carter, who looks a little too cosmetic), their personalities come through, and you can buy the idea of a speaking simian. Roth is especially good--his character plays a constant game of testosterone repression that he doesn't win often. His rage is palpable. Mark Wahlberg does a much better job as protaganist than Charleton Heston could ever have done. Overall, a good job by the cast.It's still not a perfect movie, not by a long shot. The comic relief, as with all action/serious(?) movies, gets a little distracting (although, by comic relief standards, Giamatti does a pretty good job). The humans seem a little too articulate to be so ""primitive"", and the entire explanation as to how/when/where Wahlberg's character gets where he is is never really reasonably explained. The final scenes of the movie are downright confusing, maybe close to ridiculous (if they mean what I think they're supposed to mean), and the film would have been better had it stopped five minutes sooner.I give the movie a 7.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Sure, it tries to live up to the lofty social-political commentary of the original, but here there's nothing to back it up-- the plot is shallow, the dialogue lame and the characters are so underdeveloped we can hardly recall their names.
For example, near the end of the film, a human boy stands up to his ape oppressors in what I assume was meant to be a moving moment. But it has little impact because the character has never been properly introduced; the scene is the first in which he figures prominently. Similarly, two Ape generals square off at one point in what is clearly intended as a battle between two giants. But the set-up for their feud is so scant (the bland line of dialogue inserted earlier in the film) that the pay-off is virtually non-existent. They fight, one wins...whoopee.Characters like these appear throughout the film. The lead female human seems to exist solely for her cleavage; Kris Kirstofferson appears as a human male who does almost nothing and who, like his counterparts mentioned above, engages in a Big Moment that fails to have any impact. It's hard to feel bad for human slaves who are this dull. As for the apes, they're so one-dimensional they're better described as types than as actual characters. Most notably, there's the evil general (played with wonderful vitriol by Tim Roth), who seems to simply hate all humans, period. His behavior is entirely one-note: he stomps about, growls and acts viciously at every opportunity, and almost always without sufficient motivation. As a villain he's about as interesting as Skeletor was in the old He-Man cartoon. Likewise, Helena Bonham Carter's character, an ape with a soft spot for humans, is little more than a caricature of good will.Finally, the lead character, played by Mark Wahlberg, walks through the film in an apparent daze. Never does he seem amazed by this monkey planet he's landed on, nor does he appear distraught by the predicament in which he's found himself. Charlton Heston's lead character in the original POTA film may have been over-the-top in places, but he at least struck the right notes of paranoia, amazement and outrage. By comparison, Wahlberg seems drugged; and this is a problem because we're supposed to be seeing this world, at least in part, through his eyes. Recall the introductory portions of the original POTA, in which the team of wayward astronauts slowly makes their way into Ape territory. Their journey becomes stranger and stranger as they encounter human skins, a tribe of primitive humanoids, and finally the fully-clothed warrior apes. Never does this new film approach this level of horror and amazement. Instead, its protagonist runs through its world like a blip in a video game. And that's a shame.On the good side, Rick Baker's makeup is, on the whole, extraordinary; Danny Elfman's score is rich and bombastic; and the physicality of the ape characters' performances are fun in that they are much more simian in nature than those featured in the 1968 original. But even fans of Tim Burton will have a hard time finding his personal stamp on this film.
And what of the surprise ending? It's there, and it's fun. But it feels tacked on and most viewers will probably figure it out a minute or so before it actually happens.If you really want to enjoy this movie, go buy the action figures. That's the point, right?","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I loved the original so any attempt to top it was, in my perspective, bound to fail. And surely, it did.
This is one misconceived film, and has nothing in the form of pace, believability or lovable characters. The ending (here we go again) is glued on for no apparent reason, other than trying to be true to the novel on which the film is based. The plot is more or less non-existent. And why is it that these ""wild"" humans, are running around with nicely combed and washed hair, and look like a million? A film such as this, has got to be more dirty. We're talking about a planet ruled by monkeys damn it! And when humans can talk and communicate with the apes the analogy to our own world is lost, along with any reason as to why Mark Wahlberg would make a difference.Speaking of; one of the main reason for the failure is Mark Wahlberg. I havent seen an actor do such a bad job in....well, ever actually. He has got the face of a robot, and less talent than one. And why does he make such a big difference in this world? He has got no charisma, he displays no leadership, he has trouble raising his voice, he delivers all of his lines with the same tone of voice and is generally as inspiring as a taxaccountant. Why are we led to believe that he could lead a rebellion against monkey-tyrrany?Without a doubt Tim Burtons worst film. Avoid!4/10 for good makeup and nice FX's.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I thought I would dislike it intensely, because that is how I feel about just about everything else that Tim Burton does (Beetlegeuse, Frankenweinie, Legend of Sleepy Hollow). However, it really wasn't that bad. That said, here is what I found lacking:The plot. Pretty ho-hum. Man gets lost, man tries to get found.The hero. Mark Wahlberg just doesn't cut it for me. He is fine as a supporting character, say, as a crewmember. But he doesn't carry this film. I never really cared about him as a person, and he never really did anything that could be called virtuous or admirable (except for the predictable scene where he saves the teenager as the apes attack). His character is shallow and wooden.The make-up & costumes. Sometimes great, as in the gorilla generals and Gen. Thade. The female ape make-up was silly, and the pants suit that Helena Bonham Carter wore through the entire movie made her look like Carol Channing. Estella Warren looked like she had just robbed her costume from Raquel Welch on the set of One Million Years B.C. (although at least Raquel's role had some substance to it). The stunts. More of that silly flying around stuff that seemed to get popular after Hidden Crouching Tiger or whatever it was called came out. Since when do gorillas fly through the air?The ending. My 13-year-old daughter predicted it. And it doesn't even make sense.The sets. Stolen from the Ewok Adventure, apparently.What did I like? The pacing. It moved the movie right along and made it seem shorter than it really was.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I could go on forever about how much I love his films, but this is about PLANET OF THE APES and not Burton's career.  The original PLANET OF THE APES movie is a favorite of mine.  I have loved it since I first saw it as a child.  And I could never realize why so many of my friends would laugh at me.  No one ever understood the film.  Well, none of my childhood friends.  When I first read that Tim Burton was selected to direct the new APES film I was a little confused. He is a brilliant director, but an APES film?  A number of months later I saw the theatrical trailer and was very impressed.  Well, not entirely.  I have a very strong hatred for Mark Wahlberg.  Other than his casting, the film looked good.  When I saw the film summer of 2001, I was utterly disappointed. If any of you have seen the movie, you know what I am talking about.  I think the main problem with the movie was the script.  And that brings my attention to a possible problem with Tim Burton.  Visually, he is amazing but his taste in scripts or screenplays is lacking.  Hell, maybe he decided to do the movie before reading the script. That would probably explain a lot. This was the first Tim Burton movie that I not only did not like, but rather hated.  The movie is incredibly slow, boring, and very expensive.  However, visually (if you were to watch the movie with no volume) the film is great. With the exception of a few action sequences. For some reason every other action sequence or so by Burton is terribly filmed.  I thought he did a wonderful job with the action in his previous film SLEEPY HOLLOW, but the climatic battle in PLANET OF THE APES has some horrible shots.  On the other hand of course it had some beautiful and provocative scenes too.  One in particular is of the chimp Tim Roth running on all fours towards a fleeing Mark Wahlberg into the old space ship. And also the shots of the Ape infantry charging on the frontline on all fours was incredibly brilliant and scary.  As I stated earlier, great film visually and Burton is amazing but the dialogue and script for this movie are horrible. In conclusion, I'd give this film a D.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

This movie is convincing mostly because of the story line. It sounds like tall tales. In other words, not convincing as the original Planet of the Apes which do deserve an 8. This one is one of those movie I won't recommend my friends to watch except for the beginning ape chase scenes. The story falls on a couple of things that makes it difficult to accept. Time traveling through the future in an electrical storm in space seems too far fetched compared to the original movie, which traveled near light speed. The fact that the space station had a couple of ""space pod"" and Standard Operating Procedures, it's unlikely that any space station would be traveling around chasing space pods lost in electrical storms. Space stations' aren't built for chasing or rescue missions. They could have sent a couple of space pods, with a chimp is more plausible. The fact that humans became a slave, and yet they can speak English and talk, makes it unconvincing compared to the original movie which they aren't able to talk as the Apes are convinced that humans are unintelligent. The original movie the Apes assume humans to be stupid since they can't communicate is a more convincing story. The ending of the movie, I believe spoiled the movie completely and this is where the scoring is bad. In any good movie there are three things that's is key to scoring. The plausibility of the story, the beginning movie to pull us into the story, the ending that wraps up the entire move is the most important. The story fails on plausibility as mentioned here. Why are humans too passive is unconvincing. The fact that humans in this movie has no capacity to use weapons and being unorganized is very unconvincing. Humans are well known to be organized in times like these. The ending is really hard to rationalized into the story and no plausibility at all. It creates a Pandora's box. So if I were a movie producer and I was to do something different, time traveling through a wormhole, a black hole is more convincing, if we want to add to the old original story. The fact that a small space pod to travel long distance is unconvincing also even with all the technology in this movie. A human slavery is only possible through greater limitations of freedom as in concentration camps conditions is more convincing I believe, or the fact that the humans brains were ""neutered"" into stupidity, as in the removal of frontal lobe is another possibility. The fact that human slave they became a butler and a maid is an unintentional comedy and too unbelievable. The fact that they put humans in wood cage and to assume humans are too stupid to find a way to break those bamboo wood sounds unrealistic. Humans intelligence couldn't be that stupid given a slight 2000 years or more of evolution. I can continue to criticized this movie because of it's many mistake. In my opinion the movie compares slightly better than Snakes on the Plane movie. You can make another Planet of the Apes...if the story line is a plausible one, I believe and make some of the fixes mentioned here. As you noticed directors in general ignore good story writing but in animations where changes are very difficult and costly, a good story is much more possible. This is why Pixar Studios and Disney have such an impressive list of classic movies in spite of the fat that its a cartoon. While story writing can be written on the fly, it is this reason why Xanadu flopped, or in more recent one Disaster Movie was a complete flopped. The movie was made before the story and they had no idea as to the title of the movie.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I grow tired of hearing all the comparisons to the original. The worst complaint is that the film was not Satirical enough. This is a new movie.  A satirical version of this movie already exists.  Why would Tim Burton want to do another satirical version???  He wouldn't, that would be redoing a movie.  This is a re-imagining! Perhaps this is why tim burton decided to create a more literal interpretation of the subject matter.  And in so doing takes nothing away from the original and actually amplifies the sentiment of the original while actually maintaining a social message!  It may have be in a different area and more straight forward but it still echoes the sentiment of the original.  As for the complaints that the film makes no sense, it makes perfect sense.  One gets the sense that much of what happened will be explained later, in a sequel.  I could think of several explanations of various plot ""holes"" and inconsistencies.  It just depends on what they have in mind.  Just remember how much was left out of the original POTA.  To watch that film alone without all the sequels prompts many questions.   Also, I thought the small homages to the original were brilliant and fun.  And, The Special effects were astounding.  The makeup alone is completely worth seeing.  It really saddens me to see such a backlash against this film.  I left the theater actually feeling like this film stands right in line with the rest of the Apes films.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

(One of them is the fact that this movie should never have been made at all but let's put that aside.) It might sound strange but the thing that troubled and disappointed me the most was that the humans in the movie could all speak normal English and all acted like almost normal humans and some even seemed to have make up and hairdressers! Another troubling thing was Mark Wahlberg. Now, I'm not one of those people who have something against Mark Wahlberg, not at all but he was simply totally miscast. He is too much of an hero, which is not the right type of guy for this movie. And let's not even get started about Estella Warren or Tim Roth's overacting and some of the unneeded and weak characters in a disappointing story with an ending so weird that not even the smartest person will understand it.Now, I must say that the movie has some nice sets, costumes and make up that are typically trademark Tim Burton, the special effects are also quite good. It's also good that there still is plenty of humor to enjoy but it's not enough to make the movie interesting.There are some nice scene's but there also are some extremely disappointing scene's. The hunt is pretty cool (although still not as cool as the '68 hunt version) but the end battle is extremely weak and disappointing and ends too abrupt. Especially the Colonel Attar vs. Krull battle is laughable and a disgrace for the two characters that were about the most interesting two in the movie.I do not hate this movie I simply did not enjoy it.

I bought if off a drugstore book rack because the title was interesting and I was crazy about science fiction. I was somewhat disappointed when the book turned out to be more an allegory on the human condition than hard sci-fi.In the book, two space travelers, one male, one female, discover a canister drifting in space. Inside it is a manuscript which, conveniently enough, they can read. The unnamed author of the manuscript tells his story: He is an extreme misanthrope, so disillusioned with the human race and man's inhumanity to man that he builds a spaceship and, along with two or three other men (no women), he travels at relativistic speeds (hence there is time dilation amounting to centuries or millennia) to another solar system, where they find an earthlike planet. It is, you guessed it, the Planet of the Apes. The apes have an advanced civilization and the humans are the oppressed animals. The humans are mute and naked and really do live like animals. The ape civilization consists of the three ape races: The chimpanzees are the scientists and the engineers, the gorillas are the military and laborers, and the orangutans are the philosophers and statesmen. He is separated from his companions, captured and paired for mating with a woman, whom he names Nova. The senior member of his crew, a scientist, is eventually rediscovered, but the scientist has regressed to a subintelligent level by having to live as a human. (His degeneration was not the result of brain surgery, as in the 1968 film, which was a big goof anyway, because the man's operation was on the right, whereas in the normal human brain, language function is in the left hemisphere.) The protagonist learns the language of the apes and becomes a celebrity among them. With this new life comes disturbing revelations: The apes behave much more like 'animals' than they would like to believe of themselves, and he discovers old documents that reveal that on this world, as on his own, the humans were originally the superior race. Their downfall came when they began to perform experiments in intelligence amplification on apes. The enhanced apes overthrew and subjugated the humans. The protagonist is appalled by the discovery that the apes can be as degenerate, corrupt and ""inhumane"" as humans. At the same time, his position is increasingly jeopardized as the apes' distrust of him grows, along with their fear of him as a potential leader of a resurgent human race. I don't recall whether he escapes and finds his old ship, or manages to build a new one, but he leaves the Planet of the Apes with Nova, who is now pregnant with his child and learning to speak, and travels back to Earth (more time dilation), or what he thinks is Earth, only to discover that it is now also a Planet of the Apes. Here the manuscript breaks off, and the two space travelers ponder its meaning, whereupon it is revealed that they are---surprise!---apes as well.You can see how far the original film departed from the novel, and threw in a lot of hokey nonsense as well. Yet it retained some of the flavor, essential ideas and philosophy of the book. The new Planet of the Apes has not even done that much. It is a tame (no pun intended), essentially mindless exercise in special effects. Why did they even bother?","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Science fiction aficionadosshould take note that, unlike the original PLANET OF THE APES,this non-remake makes no effort to lay any kind of logicalconnection between the different time frames alluded to in the plot.If you have ever seen any time travel films before, even mediocreones, you will have come to expect some logical inconsistencies(reflecting that time travel is theoretically impossible in the firstplace), but Burton seems intent on simply giving the finger to anysemblance of logic here. If you haven't seen the film yet, you haveprobably been told to expect a surprise ending; I would tell you toexpect a surprisingly stupid ending that is surprisingly insulting tothe audience's intelligence.Burton's fondness for dark sets is apparent here,  but instead ofthe decadent, wildly overgrown urban landscape of his GothamCity,  all you get here is sensory deprivation and an urge to nod offduring one of the film's frequent and lengthy periods of inactivity.The ape makeup, which was groundbreaking at the time of theoriginal film, has not really improved much. Some of it is quitegood (Tim Roth as Thade), but it is otherwise uneven, as is theacting.Burton makes much of the difference in strength and agilitybetween apes and humans, but the way he shows this is not byendowing the apes with natural animal-like grace, but by loadingthem onto hidden catapults and launching them into the scene. It'slaughable.The DVD has a few extras, including commentary by Tim Burtonand Danny Elfman, but I got the best laugh from the cast biosection, which gives page after page of gushing plaudits forBurton's untalented girlfriend, Lisa Marie, who is alleged to haveappeared in the film. Darned if I could find her though. Jeez, what_won't_ Burton stoop to to keep his bed warm!Rating: 3/10.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

The ""re-imagine"" concept just does not work in the movies (just ask Gus Van Sant). But I thought Burton might make it work. Well, I was wrong. I adore Burtons work and in my personal opinion he is Hollywood´s greatest director, but that does not mean that I love every piece of celluloid that he comes in contact with. POTA has some potentials but somehow they just fizz out. You can never stop asking yourself ""Why?"" Why make a remake of a near perfect film? If POTA 2001 would have been the first ape film, this might have been hailed as a great film. The fact simply is that we have seen this before. And what what is Burton doing with a comic relief?! Limbo is doing the same for this movie as Jar Jar did for Episode one! He is to much, to ""haha funny"" and should have been killed when the humans escaped. But no, we have to endure him throughout the whole film! The movie does have some good points though. First of all it has Tim Roth. He is without a doubt the best actor in this film and his ape impression is at times very frightening. The sets, costumes and everything in that department was impeccable, in a Burtonian way. There have been some who say that the make up in this film is no better than in the original. That is pure nonsense. I am inclined to think that these people are only blinded by some hate of Burton and his POTA and for fouling the memory of the original that they can´t give credit where credit is due! The makeup in this movie is sheer brilliance. The movement of the actors lips are now visible and so are other discreet features. This is better make up and saying otherwise just underlines that some people can´t judge films without letting feelings cloud there judgement. Last words. See the film at least two times. The initial shock wears off an you like it better the next time.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The original film was nature vs man, evolution alongside devolution, and an overall downward spiral towards mankind's oblivion (or pretty much the next worst thing, anyway, since people aren't totally extinct by the time the main character crash lands on either eponymous planet).The best things in the 2001 remake are the handful of pop references made first in the original movie, the references to modern (some 21st Century) attitudes (""I'm having a bad hair day,"" says one female chimp in Burton's version), and the overall upgraded feel and tone of the movie now that more than thirty-three years have elapsed in the world of cinema.Its a given to say that special-effects are a boon to this new, improved version.  Yet, I miss hearing all that (somewhat) great dialog heard in POTA 1968.Everyone I know who's seen the Burton version has mentioned something about its ending, and the questions it poses.  Let us all hope Simos (the name of the simian deity in this film) answers our inquisitive, and slightly confused, prayers in a rational manner... ...and will there be an even more confusing sequel to this reimagination?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Except about the fantastic overall look and special effects, far above the original -- after all, special effects and make-up have come a long way since 1968.It is not a copy of the original. It gives a nod to the original in several places, rather obviously, and with a bit of whimsical tongue-in-cheek; apparently Charlton Heston agreed, and I trust I need not elaborate.I actually rate this one as a 9.5, and would have gone to ten, but for the unclear ending; they were obviously looking for something that would have the impact of the Statue of Liberty showing up, half buried, as we saw in the first film; this one falls a bit short in that regard, and while I could ""figure it out,"" it should have been more simple and obvious. It wasn't.Helena Bonham Carter pretty much walks away with this one, as she makes about the cutest chimp anyone can imagine. Again, I trust I need not elaborate; just why Our Hero would leave this world, I dunno. The two finest babes on the planet both wanted him.

There is one mildly entertaining action sequence, and there is the odd in-joke that works (most notably Charleton Heston's cameo), but that's about it as a MOVIE.As a technical exercise, this film displays little of Burton's usual brilliance, but Rick Baker's makeup definitely deserves special mention. The ape characters are incredible, and show remarkably subtle facial expressions.  Had the characters themselves be better written, there's some chance this wouldn't have been a total waste.3/10 for outstanding makeup and a few cool in-jokes.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

I was quite excited because I had missed my chance at the box office. Boy am I glad I didn't waste my money buying a ticket. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There is no plot, no character motivation, no life, no story thru-line to carry the picture and the ending is so bad, it reeks of a low-budget, straight-to-video, sci-fi flick. I am a HUGE fan of Tim Burton and I think he is one of the most brilliant directors Hollywood has to offer. In fact, ""Sleepy Hollow"", in my opinion, is his best film to date. But POTA is a film that could best be described as never-should've-happened. Why does Hollywood see the need to remake classic, highly rated films and turn them into pure trash? This is one film that should NOT have been remade or reimagined or whatever you wish to call it. Why can't Hollywood remake films that were terrible when they were FIRST released instead of doing things the other way around??? The screenplay for this film is drenched with cheesy dialogue. (In one scene, David Warner tells his daughter, Helena Bohnam Carter to wash her hands before dinner after she has been touching humans!!!) The writers saw fit to throw every kind of silly convention of humor that one could relate to humans and apes at the screen and expected us to eat it up. This is one viewer who wishes he could make the writers eat their own words!!! Save you money and rent something else.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I agree to a certain extent. Burton means a good looking movie with a pretty bad script, but he most often get away with it. Sleepy Hollows is excellent for example.This movie however, has a really really bad script. There are plotholes all over and the ending is terrible. One would think that since he based it on a idea very well covered before that the script would be easy to make into something marvelous. But instead it was predictable and full of plotholes. I will not mention them here since a few of you might not have seen to movie, but trust me on this one.The actors taking the shapes of apes are excellent, and they do a good enough job. Mark Wahlberg is stiff and doesn't really feel like he is in a perilous situation, but that is mostly because of his lack of lines, he says very little, asks almost nothing it doesn't really fit in what a person would do in his situation. You don't really get to know any of the characters.So, pretty good effects, lousy script, a typical burton movie, but in this case, the script is so bad and the effects not good enough to make watching it worthwhile.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The problem does not lie in the fact that they tamper with the story from the first film. As they've made clear, the producers and director are not trying to remake a classic, but use it (and the book it originated from) as a stepping stone to build the new movie, so their deviations from the original would not be a problem... if they were good.Burton doesn't have a good starting point: the script is very, very bad, your usual Hollywood-esque pastiche of old lines with (supposedly) new parallelisms and not-very-bright pop culture references. All that would be interesting if something happened, along the story, to the characters. Sadly, it is not so: the astronaut, the good apes and the pretty girl remain the same (that is, totally uninteresting) throughout the movie. Even the bad apes are not really changed, as the ending goes. And let's not even start with the inconsistencies...This is by far Burton worse movie ever, light years away from his classics. His trademarks barely show: we don't care about what happens with the characters at all, the sets lack the grandeur that we've learn to love and expect (""Sleepy Hollow"" and ""Batman"" come to mind) and his ""wicked sense of humor"" is limited to changing classic lines from being spoken by humans to simian mouths.The acting is really bland, too. Mark Wahlberg has proven that he can act. But he wanders through ""Planet..."" with his best ""Keanu-I-don't-know-what-the-heck-is-going-on-Reeves"" look on. And Stella Warren... well, she IS pretty. Helena Bonham-Carter is as boring as usual and Tim Roth has lots of fun but is well below some of his best movies.The summing up of all of this is in one word: disappointment. Not from what it is (even at this point the movie can be seen if one has enough popcorn and soda) but from what it could had been with the talent implied. And yes, the make-up is awesome and Heston's cameo is really cool, but somehow they are not sufficient to save a picture from being just another fancy way of wasting your time and your money.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Things like 'beware of the bomb' and 'where is this technological World coming to?'. At the time, space-faring people were very much on everyones mind and PotA was part of what people were interested in.Nowadays things are a little different. The cold war and the nuclear threat are all but forgotten and people travelling into space are only of interest to some people at NASA and a group of Trekkies. When this movie was announced I was very interested in the way this remake would re-actualize this movie.Let's be short about this: They didn't.Not only didn't they translate the original into something current audiences would relate to, they also used some lines without giving it any relevance to the rest of the new story. At some point General Thade is warned about the dangers of humans...about their inherent violent nature and such. In the original this was caused by the key-event responsible for apes-taking-over, namely the nuclear war. In this new remake this warning has NO basis in the story at all! The opposite is true.The 2 endings to the story are even more unlikely and illogical. I'll not spoil things any further by describing them, but I was appalled at the complete senselessness of it all.My final feelings were: ""No way!"" and ""Who cares?""","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The ending simply is not possible. What makes a movie memorable is always a strong ending, onethat gets talked about (read: The Sixth Sense).  Just because thisending will be talked about do not make the mistake of assumingthat it is a memorable ending.  The original ending in the 1968'Apes' was in there for shock value and I never did like it but atleast it could be explained!  Anyway, go see the movie foryourselves if you must, and if there are any physicists or scientistsout there who feel they can adequately explain the plausibility ofthat ending please feel free to tell me.  This film is just the latestbig budget disappointment in a summer saturated with moviesthat do not live up to the hype.  My advice, save your money on thisfilm and go see a worthwhile film like Made, The Princess and theWarrior, Sexy Beast or even Kiss of the Dragon, which makes nopretenses about the kind of movie it is (not to mention that you getto watch a teaser for Black Hawk Down before the movie!).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Nope.Instead, we saw mediocre special effects and make-up trying to hold together a mere shadow of the original story.The entire beauty of the Original POTA can be summed up like this:  Taylor is a human on a planet that for some reason is run by apes and humans are slaves.  He longs to leave the planet and get back HOME to Earth.  The shocker at the end of the movie is that he already IS home.The new Apes could not hope to compete with that and, given that so many people already know the ending, tried very hard to end with an equal, if different, shock.  It didn't work.One thing about the ending (no spoiler here): you either loved it, or you hated it.  I hated it.  There has been so much discussion about whether or not it made sense...all I can say is that if you have to argue about it, then it wasn't clear enough.  I think the movie would have been much more entertaining if the story line brought you to the ending, (like the original did), instead of throwing it at you from out of nowhere.
I'm glad I saw it.  Once.  I'm also glad I rented it on DVD instead of paying theater prices to see it.And I'm thinking of buying the originals...","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Basically it's about a man who crashes onto a planet which is totally flipped in the ecosystem where the apes are the rulers and the humans are the savages. Sounds Familiar right.  Like I said Tim Burton is a great director he does do a good job of trying to make his mark in visuality ,but it's the same old story. Now the only real good thing was Paul Geomanti(Sorry if I miss prenounced his name)he brought a little bit of humor to the story.

I can't explain it, but there's something so otherworldly and exotic about the production design, makeup and effects, a true storyteller's touch used, resulting in a piece with elements of fantasy and world building brought lushly to the forefront, whereas the newer films just felt somewhat clinical and sterile, going through minimalist motions without any real sense of wonder applied. Oh and another thing: real, tactile makeup on actual human actors, which will win against motion capture/cgi any day. There's also an old world, medieval feel to this planet, as the 'humans being subservient to apes' dynamic has already been in full swing for generations, as opposed to a lengthy origin story that takes up most of the newer trilogy. No build up here, just Marky Mark getting marooned on a distant world dominated by simians, fighting his way through their ranks, sort of falling in love with one (Helena Bonham Carter as a monkey=kinky) and attempting to find a way back to earth. There's various apes of all shapes and sizes at war, the most memorable of which is a sleek, snarling Tim Roth as Thade, a volatile warlord who despises humans. Michael Clarke Duncan towers over everyone as Attar, his cohort and fellow soldier, and seeing already be-jowelled Paul Giamatti as a cumbersome orangutan is priceless. The human faction is led by weathered Kris Kristofferson and his daughter (Estella Warren, quite possibly the most beautiful girl on the planet), leading the dregs of humanity as they exist in hiding and fight for their lives. No expense was spared in filling every frame of this planet with lived-in splendour and atmospheric decoration, from suits of armour and architecture to the overgrown thickets of mountainous vegetation that grow on this world. As for the apes themselves, it's terrific how real they feel. It's the same thing that happened with Lord Of The Rings vs. The Hobbit, and the switch from practical Orc effects to the overblown cgi madness of the goblins in the later films. The human eye is inherently adept at deciphering what is real and what is not, and the effects of the later Ape films with Andy Serkis just felt lifeless and orchestrated, whereas here the makeup prosthetics are organic, authentic and wonderful to look at. Don't even get me started on the ending either, it's completely brilliant and will leaving you in cold isolation as the credits roll, a perfect gut punch to a film that could have easily turned sappy in the eleventh hour. So that's my two cents. Bring on the backlash.","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

So, I wasn't going into this movie expecting to not have any ""cult-classic"" expectations dashed upon the rocks.  I was hoping that 1) This film earned its ""Directed by Tim Burton"" tag, 2) I wanted a half-way intelligent story, and 3) I wanted to marvel at the monkey (excuse, me, *ape*) makeup.Let me take those points in reverse.  You've probably heard that the makeup is incredible.  Well, it is.  Different species of simians are represented, from baboon to monkey to chimpanzee, and the ""evolved"" forms represented in the movie are pulled off well.  But it would be for naught if the actors themselves couldn't ""get into character.""  Let me tell you, the ape cast did superb jobs.  Mr. Roth, playing the villain general Thade, should get an award; his imitations of simian mannerisms (pawing of his comrades, wild vine-climbing screeching fits of anger) were spot-on.  Helena Botham-Carter kept up with her costar in her role of human beneficiary; she would toggle back and forth between heated intelligent arguments on the worth of humans and ""ooh ooh ooh ah! ah! aaahh!""-ing when she'd panic.  Ok, that's exaggerating, but you get the idea.Story-wise?  Ehh... I think I would have liked it better if we were focused on the monkeys rather than the ""spaceman"".  Mark Wahlberg (sp?) was decent, but he was a bit rough in some parts, and when the movie trailed behind him and his rag-tag bunch as they fled the city, it dragged.  When the focus switched back to the apes (especially Thade), you had interesting dialog exchanges, wonderful acting, and a generally more interesting movie.
Are you going to this movie to see a Tim Burton movie?  ... Well, you *may* be disappointed somewhat.  I didn't get the Tim Burton feel like I did watching ""Sleepy Hollow"".  But if you go in simply expecting to see a well-directed movie, you'll probably like it better.  Burton fans need to draw their own conclusions, but it felt like the movie was being directed by someone else, though someone equal to the task.Bottom line: It's not the best film.  But it's a good film.  I didn't feel like I wasted $7.00 seeing it in the theater.  I hope you don't, either.

A good cast, although the male lead was about as dull as dry toast sitting in a toaster for a day and a half (I hope the apes do whatever they want to him in the sequel). It isn't even the obtuse ending that bothered me. It's that there was something so lacking. With the gifts of computer animations and the advancements in the craft of movie-making, why couldn't one care less what happens to these characters. I don't like Charlton Heston, but when he told off those apes in the first movie, I cheered him. As with the original, why are the humans so docile and disorganized. They have evolved to the upright state, fully clothed, communicative--but they aren't more than silly critters to the apes. How would you feel if your dog started making sweaters, got married, and lived in a cave? Would you be interested in whether he had become a sentient creature, capable of more advance thinking.Another question is why those apes were able to bounce in the air so much. I've never seen a monkey bounce; I've seen them swing, not bounce. The bad guy (excuse me, bad simian) can come flying like an oversexed kangaroo at any point. I have to admit, I liked the battlefield scenes. They reminded me of a kickoff at an NFL football game. Apparently they planned to take over the planet by running into each other.I really did like the physical appearance of the apes--there was great expression. I got a kick out of the humans being sold as pets in stores. As usual, of course, the gorillas are the dumb ones (It's because they are big--right--big people are supposed to be dumb). Oh, wait! They may have been the script writers and got exactly what they had coming to them!Once again, a disappointing summer--two blockbusters in the science fiction field, this thing and Jurassic Park III.

A deep movie that managed to keep my attention for about 2 hours, spark questions and for once, NOT EXPLAIN EVERY LITTLE ACTION THE CHARACTERS TAKE.  My pet peeve today is that movies have to take so much time in explaining every tiny detail about the plot.  In essence they are preaching to the lowest common denominator. In a movie that contains so many sub-plots, Tim Burton does a great job of presenting the foundation though dialogue, and then the rest of the plot though visual aids.  If you want to understand the movie you have to look for the details and then come to your own conclusions, which isn't that hard if you were actually watching the movie, and have some reasonable level of intelligence (which of course is rare into days movie viewing demo graph, and no I'm not an old cranky manI'm only 16).  If your tired of the same mush that infests out cinema today and want to see a movie that is smart, funny, and makes you think see this movie.

Still, this movie not only violated real-world logic, it violated its own created logic, thus making it one of the messiest, frustrating movies I have seen, ever.  Mark Wahlberg was brilliant in Boogies Nights and Three Kings, but here he is unspectacular.  There is never any reason given why he stands out among all other humans as being special, though the story depends on Ms. Carter's interest in him.  He wears a white shirt, that is all.  Otherwise he is quiet, and does nothing out of the ordinary until later in the movie. Roth's Thade also takes an interest in Wahlberg's character, but again, without reason or logic.I believe Thade was the worst villian, ever.  He had no logical reason for wanting to wipe out the humans.  And this is where the story really breaks down.  The motivation is gone.  The apes have achieved supremacy, but yet there is still a need to kill all humans, who live like wild animals, and are thus harmless to the much more powerful and advanced apes.  Apes who ride horses (which the movie refuses to explain why they are on this planet, though it explains the origin of the Apes and Humans).  The logic comes to a complete break down when Thade's general turns on him, for no reason.  He has not seen anything to warrant his turn-around, and this unexpected and unlikely twist further diminishes the story.I thought I was going to vomit and retch, I desperately tried to plead with this movie to make more sense, that if you set up a fantasy world, you must abide by the rules of that world.  But it did not, and it caused my head to explode in complete pain.I give it a 3 out of 10, for costumes alone.  Those Apes looked realistic (save their body-size), and the Roman-theme was a nice touch, albeit Gladitor-esque.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Not exactly a remake...but worth your time regardless.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9775682/?ref_=tt_urv","planktonrules","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2467618/?ref_=tt_urv","6 May 2024","""Planet of the Apes"" (2001), despite its title, is not exactly a remake or sequel to the old ape movies from the 1960s-70s. So much of the plot is different, I see it more as a reimagining of the story.As far as this film goes, it isn't rated all that well. Additionally, the star, Mark Wahlberg, made public statements about how the studio ruined this film...mostly by giving the director Tim Burton impossible to meet deadlines...resulting in a rushed movie. You might want to know that I am a big fan of the original series...so impressing me won't be easy.Speaking of impressing....the ape costumes and makeup are insanely good. I thought they were CGI but when I read Rick Baker actually used practical effects to make the apes, I was shocked. It is really amazing...and it makes we wonder how the newer ape movies could be better...that is, for the male apes. The female apes look creepy and almost like an entirely different species. They could have used some work.The story is very different. It begins in 2029 on a space station. Captain Davidson (Wahlberg) goes out in a space craft during some weird space storm to retrieve a chimp astronaut (a 'normal' Earth-type chimp...not a scary one like you'll later see in the film). His ship goes out of control...flying through space and crashing on some planet controlled by apes.These apes manage to be even crueler and meaner than those in the original films...as well as acting more ape-like. Among them, the most ardently anti-human and evil is Thade...and after the Captain an some other humans escape from their incarceration, he's excited about how to use this not only to kill humans but gain power.So is this any good? Well, it's a heck of a lot better than the paltry 5.7 score it now has. It would have you think the film is very poor...and it certainly isn't. While I hate remakes and reimaginations, this one kept my interest and I enjoyed it very much. And, since the newer reboot is supposed to be better, the film has me wanting to see more.By the way, the very end scene is neat...and makes no sense whatsoever...one of the weakest parts of the story, actually.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

He hadn't seen it. It was right at the time the starship of the movie's hero landed in the strange land. And I told him that yes, more or less, at this point, the movies were pretty much the same. Right there and then, similarities just vanished. The starship of this new version landed, and then the new version began to orbit around the old one, as tough admiring its excellency, but never getting into its atmosphere. The thing is that this new movie remind me of the old one over and over again, not because the latter is revived, but because its essence completely absent, and I missed it. Where the original gave us a science fiction story with RATIONAL twists of imagination, the new one develops as a succession of events that happen just because somebody said so. And when things happen just because they have to, the wonder of science fiction disappears, and we are left with a boring movie. And I heard about the `surprise' ending before I saw the movie. It is surprising, all right, but for the wrong reasons. Just when you think that nothing could be worse, well, it does. At this point, the new version just decides to give up the orbiting and finally heads for the space of oblivion. This ending leaves interrogations, not about the argument, but more like `What was Tim Burton trying to accomplish with that?'. I admire the fact that Tim Burton wanted to do something different, not just copying the original version. I mean, he dared to go against the odds and try and build something new inspired by a true classic. But as expected, he has only shown, once again, that you better don't mess with classics of that caliber.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

No, not a short fat penguin, but I'm sure he has a unsettlingly dark and creepy film adaptation of Bloom County up his sleeve somewhere.  After all, you saw what he did to poor Batman, once a proud superhero who often found himself in goofy contrived plots fighting pastel colored villains, he now is a dark, scary, menacing type inhabiting the now perpetually nocturnal Gotham City.On the other hand, Tim Burton actually isn't that bad of a director when he's working with original material.  I rather liked Ed Wood and I thought that Edward Scissorhands had some good moments.  But when it comes to doing remakes of older movies, or film adaptations of television shows, he just plain sucks.  Case in point, Planet of the Apes.  What once was a fascinating film with a biting, socially relevant anti-war message has become a ""Taco-Bell commemorative cup free with purchase of a large soda"" kind of movie. Imagine if this kind of thing catches on, someday we may see a remake of Dr. Strangelove with Gary Oldman playing the base commander, Bill Pullman as the president, Tom Arnold as the Joint Chief of Staff, and Will Smith riding the bomb to his death in blazing color, followed by a hip-hop remix of ""We'll Meet Again"" playing over the closing credits.Anyhow, getting back to the movie.  There is one particular scene in this movie I find particularly troubling.  Toward the beginning, when the whistle/spaceship thing the hero was flying crashed on the planet, it came in at an acute angle through the trees and crashed in a swampy, wooded area. The ship then subsequently sank.  This is a BLATENT rip off of Star Wars. When I saw this scene, I forgot what movie I was watching and was temporarily disoriented when I didn't see Yoda shortly afterward.  Now, I know that ideas are sometimes borrowed from other movies, and that's okay. But I would appreciate it if they could at least TRY to change it around a little, or give it a new twist.  But no, they didn't.  They could have saved some money if they had just reused the scene from Star Wars (which probably cost one-tenth as much to film).Well, it happened, they remade Planet of the Apes, leaving a nasty stain on the rich tapestry of western culture.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The plot is very smooth and the film carries along well, which is to be somewhat expected, as it's a re-make, but that shouldn't be taken for granted, because even with little changes, re-makes can be screwed up.The actors and makeup artists did an amazing job creating believable apes. The movements of the actors are astounding - the walking especially.  The makeup is incredible - becoming more rare as cinema progresses because directors and producers want to do things computer generated, because it's quicker and easier, even though makeup is more realistic.  Tim Burton's decision to go with makeup was very shrewd.Planet of The Apes is a fascinating film and provokes much thought, if you are open to it.

The film had incredible scenery and make-up.  I loved ""Ape City"" (probubly so did everyone else), and all the scenes were the veiwer gets a look at ape civilization.  The action sequences are also outstanding with a whole lot of apes flying through the air.  I also liked that the actors actualy moved and looked liked apes.  Mark Wahlberg's preformance could have been better, but was berible.  The stand-out preformances are realy Tim Roth and Helana Bonham Carter.  Both did exelently in their roles.  Roth is no where.

I give Planet of the Apes 8/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This summer has been one disappointment after another.  First there was Tomb Raider, which was full of dumb cliches.  Then there was A.I, which had too much hype behind it and was too long to keep your interest.  After all the disappointments it's a real relief that the studios can still come up with a good movie. 	Tim Burton brings us another blockbuster hit.  This is Burton's best work since Sleepy Hollow.  Burton uses his unique techniques to bring the apes alive for the film.  His artistic expertise that Burton displayed in the making of Planet of the Apes has probably made him one of the most well known directors today.  The mere talent that Burton brings to a film makes him one of the most unique directors of our time. 	Mark Wahlberg is wonderful in this film.  He plays Leo Davidson, a United States captain who crash lands on the planet and discovers that the apes rule the planet.  This is a step up for Wahlberg from 1994's Renaissance Man, where he plays Private Tommy Lee Haywood.  This is probably Wahlberg's best film since Boogie Nights. 	Tim Roth plays the evil General Thade, general to the ape army.  He despises the human race.  Charlton Heston makes a small cameo appearance as General Thade's Father, the only ape with a gun.  Overall I gave Planet of the Apes a 6.  If you liked this I would suggest renting Sleepy Hollow, Batman, and Edward Scissorhands.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Richard Zanuck returned to helm production and Tim Burton was brought on board to direct. We were so optimistic. The original was a landmark film, could they do it justice? The sequels were so juvenile and simplistic surely they had learned, alas it was not to be. This movie is a train wreck. Poorly concieved, poorly written, poorly acted, preposterous in logic and impossible to follow it defies our hopes and dreams. Even without comparison to the original it fails miserably. But we can't view it without remembering. The fundamental mistake I think is that this is more than just a story about Apes. Its about one mans odyssey, his journey through time and space searching for .... well shall we say the perfect world, only to arrive in a nightmare. The remake conveys none of that. Its a chase movie aimed at the 12 to 18 yearolds who dominate the market. All the critics gush about the wonderfull makeup and effects, really? They are all in denial. They assume that because of the technical advances in the last 30 years it must be better. Well its not. The gorillas are pretty good, but we are forced to watch closeups of Helen Bonham Carter who looks ... well looks like she has a mask on. The sets look like ...sets and the Ape village in the original is 10 times more realistic than the graphic in this version. The ending? it defies any and all explanations. I remember after watching the 68 version staggering out of the dark theater with the rest of my stunned human companions, well I staggered out of the theatre again......in disbelief.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Sadly though, most of these high school students will never see the original and won't know what they're missing.  This film is predictable at just about every turn...  lacking any of the punch that allowed the original to hit audiences with its stunning visual revelation at the end.

Others have described many of those points so ill not go into them here, but for me, what ruined the remake was the crash landing.In the remake, the main character, astronaut Leo Davidson (Wahlberg) crash lands on an unknown planet into a jungle!
Compare this to the original where astronaut Taylor (Charlton Heston) and his crew crash land into a bleak desert, its awe and desolation so well portrayed that it firmly set the tone for the movie going forward, add to that the brilliant sound effects during the various desert scenes, and the tone stayed with you until the very last scene of this cinematic masterpiece!In the remake, the jungle landing instantly deflated expectations, and drowned the tone in the swampy shallow waters of the cramped confines of the dense jungle foliage. While the tone was artfully and carefully developed in the original, where the astronauts spent some days traversing this vast eerie desert, cleverly building up expectation and and a certain level of suspense, the remake assumed the audience has no attention span, and immediately sends astronaut Leo to the ape city just a short walk away from his crash site.From there, one scene runs to another, as the plot and setting is further dumbed down.
One final note: The Forbidden zone in the remake is hiding what is more or less a single object, but in the original, the Forbidden Zone conceals an entire ancient civilization. The original far outdoes the remake in scope, vision and refinement.

The costumes look very good because they are still classically hand-made and no CGI mess.Cons: The film got me from the beginning, the first third of the film is still very mysterious and almost a little horror-like. However, this whole atmosphere is somewhat spoiled by the fact that the Monkeys somehow quickly mutate into joke characters instead of serious opponents. The story is pretty flat and the character development is barely there for the main character. The plot twist was pretty predictable.Conclusion: I fluctuate between 7/10 and 6/10 stars because I don't know what to think of this film.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Planet of the Apes will always be just campy enough to evoke less than serious empathy for the protagonist plunged into such a freakish society.  In the 2001 version, makeup, special effects, and marvelous acting on the part of the ape actors is the reason to participate.  Tim Roth is captivating.  He is no longer human when the lights go down in the theater.  Helena Bonham Carter is equally intriguing though a bit overzealous in her ape portrayal.  Mark Wahlberg does a nice job but could have used some meaty script material to engage the audience more.  What was the purpose of the human love interest? She ought to have been cut completely.  I see no reason for her in this plot.  Tim Burton's planet is eerie and real enough to let your mind ponder the potential of an ape world.  But then the apes speak and their dialogue is predictable, goofy, and finally disappointing.  With such great talent on board, a great script should not have been too hard to find.  The action was written with plenty of thought and maturity, but when it comes to verbal communication, let's just say a real ape could have written better.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The characters are uninteresting and the dialogue is virtually non existent.I especially hated the scenes where Wahlberg leads his merry men through the jungle. Now, this guy has just fallen from the sky unto an unknown planet. You would think that he would take it slowly as he is not familiar with his surroundings, but no. He instead walk as if it's his daily road to work and not once do you get a sense that they are being chased. There's a scene where all the soldiers are ready to march and at the last minute the general played by Tim Roth, gets called away because his father is dying. Yes it was perhaps a pivotal scene (which isn't saying much as there aren't any pivotal scenes) but why place it just before marching off? The movie is just not worth watching. Really watch the original if for nothing else than the famous lines by Heston.And for those of you who think the makeup is good...well...maybe I've gotten accustomed to better things because I was not impressed. I mean...The Lord of the Rings had way better makeup than this one, and they premiered at roughly the same time. No, watch the original or if you want the more modern take on the franchise go watch Rise of the Planet of the Apes - now THAT'S an epic movie largely because of an excellent Andy Serkis.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Despite being basically a B-movie with a load of men in rubber masks, it had a unique ending which will be remembered throughout cinema history (if you don't know what it is, then I won't spoil it by telling you). Therefore, now we have the remake (or 're-envisioning' as the film-makers like to call it), it had two choices: either copy the original ending and leave everyone saying they ripped off the first, or try to match it for shock value.I don't think they would have won doing either. They tried 'shock value' and failed.However, if you ignore that, Planet of the Apes (the remake) isn't actually a bad movie. If you like sci-fi (and can forgive the blasphemy of remaking such a classic) you should at least enjoy the make-up - which is awesome for creating new and varied races of apes.Not counting the ending, there are other negatives, too. There are more human characters, most of which don't get the screen time they deserve to be fully developed (and any fans of Kris Kristophen will feel short-changes as his addition is basically an extended cameo). Plus the action isn't that action-packed (but then Tim Burton is hardly an 'action director').However, despite the negatives, it's still not a bad movie. It'll never be the classic that the original was and it was a disappointment at the box office (meaning the ending will never get the explanation it deserved). Don't expect too much and enjoy the grisly performance of Tim Roth as the evil ape leader and not being able to recognise Helena Bonham Carter in her make-up.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's an action film, pure and simple. Whatever political comment Shaffner's film had is bleached out of the screenplay (by William Broyles, Jr. who penned `Cast Away', Lawrence Konner and Mark D. Rosenthal); about the only stance the film takes is on the humane treatment of animals and the topic isn't nearly provocative enough in this context. There's a large cast, including Mark Wahlberg (not yet enough of a presence to carry an action lead), Helena Bonham Carter (as stuffy as usual, even in full ape costume), Estella Warren, Paul Giamatti and, as the villain, Tim Roth. Everyone seems to be enjoying themselves but their performances are definitely in a minor key. Burton himself seems to have a curious disinterest in the project and none of the passion that infuses `Sleepy Hollow', `Beetlejuice' and even the misbegotten `Mars Attacks!' is evident here. Still, it's a passable, entertaining diversion with a flair for big screen excitement.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I went into it with high expectations, only to get a sneaking suspicion that something had gone terribly awry after the opening credits.  These are some of the elements which made viewing this excruciating:1) The set: it looked like a cross between the Wizard of Oz's flying monkeys, the Ewok Adventure and Willow.  I know we're dealing with Tim Burton here, but I just couldn't take it seriously.  And, it always looked like a SET.2)  The cast:  Mark Wahlberg, whom I normally like, just seemed too flat and not commanding enough of a character to lead any insurrection.  Estella Warren, who plays the 2001 equivalent to the original film's Nova, is so bad it's comic.  Check out the first scene in which she's introduced side by side with the Kris Kristofferson character.  The look on her face is so vacuous, you wonder how she's supposedly survived this long on the run. And speaking of Kris Kristofferson: why is he in this movie at all?  His character is completely wasted.3) Danny Elfman's swollen, distracting score:  I felt like I was watching Batman all over again.4) The character development:  The human characters are not developed at all.  We're supposed to buy that there's chemistry between the Mark Wahlberg character and Daena (Estella)?  One doesn't even really know the human characters' names by the end of the film.  I had to look them up on IMDB. I didn't care about any of the characters, and hoped they were all killed by the time the movie ended.5) The tacked-on, twist ending:  Send this ending back for a rewrite! Let's make some sense here, people.In addition to the points listed above, the dialogue was corny.  There were also numerous plots holes and distractions.  One of the distractions was how Daena got lip gloss and managed to shave her armpits while living such a primitive lifestyle.  It's also a wonder that the enslaved and nomadic humans spoke English so well.Helena Bonham-Carter does what she can with the terrible script.  The make-up effects were mixed.  The look of the female primates was not to be believed.  I assume this was done for Burton's lame satiric elements in the film.  The make-up effect on Tim Roth's Thade was more believable.  Tim Roth's scenes fare better than others, although he goes way over the top at points.Don't waste your time with this movie.  Do yourself a favor and rent the original 1968 classic instead.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I'm still trying to understand why somebody felt the original movie, deserving of much praise, had to be remade.The primate characters looked like actors wearing rubber masks.  Nearly every set looked like... well, a set.  Several characters (ie. young warboy), invisible during the development of the story, somehow become important near the end of the film.  But without character background, I felt nothing for them.  The requisite buxom blonde was easy to look at, but left me wondering why she was even there.  Any romance angle between man/blonde or man/girl-illa was undeveloped and anemic, and shouldn't have even been attempted.This was one lame waste of a Friday night, and my hard-earned money.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

So... that Walkman had to be manufactured someplace. The music being played on it had to be recorded someplace. Performed. Batteries are needed for that Walkman too. Where are the batteries made? Is there a grocery store or something to get those batteries? The whole society is in caves. So... are we to believe that in those caves are the manufacturing facilities for the batteries and the Walkman? Are the recording facilities back there? Clothing factories? Gun shops? The mall?

The subtext, however, remains largely intact. Religious, social and political themes abound, as a distorted funhouse mirror is held up to our own culture.There are plenty of good performances, notably by actors portraying apes--Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and David Warner. Helena Bonham Carter manages to be oddly appealing and even winsome through the chimp makeup.While my initial reaction was highly favorable, I'm not sure this new film will posit the longevity of the first one. It breaks no new ground to become a classic.It does feature more simian-like behavior. The apes exhibit physical characteristics of their respective species as they move about and react emotionally. The makeup is extraordinary. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should polish up another Oscar award for the brilliant Rick Baker.The movie also seems to be missing a few scenes of motivation or development. I know it was supposed to have been re-edited at the last minute. It would be interesting to view some of the deleted scenes. Here is to hoping for a wealth of bonus material on the DVD.Viewing the 1968 film is not necessary but beneficial to pick up all the intentional references, both in dialogue and situation. Some of them are rather humorous.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Basically the stories involve a spaceman who lands on a planet where the barbaric humans are controlled by intelligent apes. This version is a good film, entertaining and with a surprising ending, but it lacks the punch and depth of the first edition.Tim Burton is my favourite director. 'Bettlejuice', 'Edward Scissorhands', the first two Batman films, 'Sleepy Hollow' - all excellent: macabre, gothic and filled with black humour. 'Apes' also looks great - the sets are spectacular and the makeup is amazing: the apes truly look real. What the film lacks is some of Burton's darker, slightly disturbing touches. It plays too much like a straight action/sci-fi flick, whereas the original was a powerful allegory for racism and animal rights as well as great entertainment.One of the reasons why the latter film doesn't match up to the original's power is because all the human characters talk. In the original the human's mysterious silence added to the theme of 'men as beasts'. Here that impact is gone, but they might as well not have bothered - the humans still have nothing interesting to say. It's the apes that have all the good lines and characterisation.Also, the ending of the original 'Apes' is one of the greatest in movie history, resonating with meaning, whereas this version's finale feels like a tacked-on surprise designed to set up sequels.The other main reason why the orginal is superior is that Mark Wahlberg lacks Charlton Heston's macho charisma in the role of the heroic spaceman. Heston was cynical, angry, confused. Wahlberg is bland.Nevertheless 'Planet of the Apes' is is a good movie, a cut above the average Hollywood science fiction film. However if I was given a choice of renting the original or the new version in a few years, I know which one I'd chose.6 1/2/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There really not a lot of action in this film except for some fight scenes toward the latter half of the movie. Looking back at the original Planet of the Apes, you could see where there was a definate plot and goal. This remake doesn't have that cohesion. It does work well with the relationship between Whalberg and Carter. But the relationship between Warren and Whalberg develops too quick after the demise of Kristofferson. In that type of primitive society, Kristofferson could be father or husband but we don't know because Warren just says ""my family"". It's too obvious that the writers used her as competition for Carter. In fact you really see no reason for Kristofferson to even be in the movie. Whalberg's involvement with the primitive humans comes too quickly also. It's like they cut out a part where Whalberg should find out what this planet is for the sake of the length of the movie. The fight scenes seem inconsistant. One minute an ape kills a human with one blow but our hero (Whalberg) takes several blows and falls. But somehow,again, Whalberg maintains the common sense he has in many of his movies. Somehow through all his movies, writers give him lines that make him act (or react) realisticly. While the others have lines and actions that don't seem be what it would be if it was real, Whalberg comes in and acts like the only one sensible or realisitic being. (as though he walked from the seats into the film) So much so that when we see him in the end....an ending that makes absolutely no sense or connection with what we just saw in the rest of the movie, the look on his face is as though he thinking, ""what kind of stupid ending is this to a movie"" right on the screen.*see more in goofs for inconsistant content","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The 1968 classic was a fantastic sci-fi vision with a bubbling undercurrent packed with issues at the forefront of the era like race-relations and the ever-gnawing fear of nuclear devastation. On top of that, it had a gripping and involving storyline and quite rightly ensured its place in cinema history. However, with Tim Burton attached to this new version you could be easily forgiven for imagining it would be a taut, character-driven new film with much to commend it. After all, it's not like Paul W. Anderson was handed the reigns was it? So it comes as a massive disappointment to say that the 2001 Planet of the Apes is a disaster on every level. The normally reliable Mark Wahlberg is terrible but considering what he was given to work with it'd be unfair to place all the blame on his shoulders. As Captain Leo Davidson he takes on the equivalent to Charlton Heston's lead from the 1968 version but has none of the gritty determination that his predecessor had and spends most of the movie looking utterly bemused, possibly because he's found himself running around a world ruled by apes, possibly because he's been given such a terrible script to work with.The rest of the cast are no revelation either. Tim Roth is an unrestrained monster, but rather than being a credible villain is simply yet another cardboard cut-out Hollywood bad guy whose only separation from cinema's other dastardly Brits is the fact he's done up in a chimpanzee outfit. Burton's squeeze Helena Bonham Carter meanwhile turns in an especially cringe-worthy and highly irritating performance as the daughter of a lead ape senator who helps the humans escape. Funny how it's always family members of incredibly extreme politicians who believe in what's right isn't it? And as she spends most of the film running around talking about how unfair her kind treat the humans, fawning over Mark Wahlberg or screeching wildly, it's very hard to give her any kind of sympathy. Looks like the attempt at making an ape sexy back-fired spectacularly there fellas.It also suffers from Hollywood's tendency to move things along as quickly as possible in case the audience gets bored, for no sooner has Marky-Mark set off on his trek to find a human spacecraft than he's arrived at his destination and is ready to lead a resistance movement. The climax is a huge let down as the ruck between the apes and humans is over within minutes and before you know it, Wahlberg's jetting off into space and returning to Earth for the much talked about ending.Elsewhere, the clichés and general sense of corporate film making abound. Ape suppression of humans means they hit them with sticks and talk like the Uruk Hai from out of Lord of the Rings an awful lot and the script is packed with cringe-worthy tributes to the original (""Get your filthy paws off me you dirty stinking human,"" urrgh). The finished product is nowhere near the film you could imagine Burton making unless you'd seen it and the whole thing feels like an extended episode of a fourth rate science fiction show that takes itself too seriously. Poor, very poor.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Leo is swept up in the storm and sent to a world where apes rule over humans with an iron fist.  He is captured and brought to Ape City.

The group reaches the sacred ruins of CALIMA, and have a huge all-out battle between the ape army and the humans.This movie has intense action sequences, amazing make-up, a good score, fair visual effects, and great directing.

The original is a true sci-fi movie. This one is action/adventure. It does keep the main themes but it doesn't explore them like the original.Also what's disappointing (to some) is that you get a Planet of the Apes that isn't really and a Tim Burton movie that isn't really. It's got tremendous visuals, style and atmosphere but they aren't typical Tim Burton. These are also the movies strengths. Burton branches out to do something that doesn't scream his name. And we get a remake that more takes the idea and does a new story with it. I seem to remember this being the first ""reimagining"" remake. Then after this this seemed to be the approach to remakes. I could be remembering it wrong though.Tim Roth is very good in this. He's a very cool bad guy. And we have never seen him in anything like this before. I was surprised to learn that it was him when I grew up. All of the designs and costumes are really good.

However, it is an entertaining film which is not one of Burton's finest, but is decent blockbuster fare.The plot clicks along at a cracking rate, so it is never dull, although a bit more time dwelling on the central character and the world of the film would not have gone amiss and would have injected a bit more interest into the film. Burton cannot make up for this lack of development, but he does provide the film with his excellent breed of design which does make this, at times, an interesting visual spectacle.The characters are also fairly thinly sketched, although there are some good lines in this film, particularly those that reference the original. However, some of the performances, most of which are done through extraordinary make-up, are very good. Tim Roth chews the scenery and most of his prosthetics as he delights in the part of the villain, Thade. Helena Bonham Carter is pretty good, and Mark Wahlberg is fine, although this performance gave no hint of what he would achieve later in his career.However, the wayward climax and somewhat bewildering conclusion let the film's solid base slip and this reviewer was left satisfied, but felt that this could have been so much more. This is a bit of a blip by Burton's standards, but, as blockbusters go, this is pretty good entertainment.3 stars out of 5","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie has a great vibe to it and the story is fairly decent. However, the main protagonist is miscasted in my opinion and some events are also quite lacking. Like how easily an order from a superior officer is disregarded for silly selfish reasons putting himself at great risk. The same thing at the ending because there couldn't possibly be evenough fuel and oxygen left in that small vessel for the 'final trip'. The main battle was also a dissapointment because 'the plan' didn't make much sense, it didn't work, and choppy editing at times. As a child I felt it had more 'magic' to it but I can't blame this movie for me growing up. Still, because of the great vibe that it has and the excitement at times I still enjoyed watching it again.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

He is going to get his seventh oscar for this or at least,nominated. Danny Elfman's score was magnificent! That man is a genius. Tim Burton did a good directing this although,it was a very weak script. Mark Wahlberg does ok.

Now, don't go to this film to expect a masterpiece. Just go and enjoy yourself.Ignore(if you can) the bad dialouge and plot holes.Sit back and relax.It's a little bit of escapism that is worth the matinee price.(Key word:Matinee) The ending leaves a kind of twilight zone feel and perhaps a hint of a sequel,but hopefully they will have a better script with the next one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Oh dear! What's with these filmmakers, why do they seem to pay no attention to the story and script? Planet of the Apes (2001) is a stunning piece of film work with great make-up, effects (a few actors aside) an excellent cast.The first half of the movie is entertaining and builds well though it doesn't take a genius to work out where the story going. The second half comes across as though they ran out of time and were not sure which way to take the movie. Because this it becomes farcical! It looks like they panicked, the problem is the original movie is a classic and easily stands the test of time, the end, still a very powerful image. They concentrate of trying to replicate (in a different way) this but it's desperate. If you're going to see this film try to forget about the original and just enjoy it as a different film. This is difficult because they insist on repeating the classic lines from the first movie. I suppose they were trying to be funny, it was funny but for the wrong reasons. Planet of the Apes is an entertaining movie that does not carry much impact Michael Clark Duncan is big, Mark Wahlberg is good, and Tim Roth is great, though given the costume, setting and make-up not a difficult task! People will not be watching this film in thirty years. Yet another disappointment.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

""Batman"" showcased a vividly realized Gotham City; ""Ed Wood"" had the authentic look for the story of the worst director ever; and ""Sleepy Hollow"" showed guts by prominently displaying twisted trees and full moons for a great Halloween treat.  That's just to name a few.  And Burton's ""Planet of the Apes"" is no different.  Deserts, jungles, extravagant makeup and costumes are all stunning in this film.Mark Wahlberg plays the role made famous by Charlton Heston (who has a short cameo that is terrific fun to see).  He is an astronaut who gets more or less stranded on a strange planet where the apes rule and humans are slaves. Wahlberg leads the people to rebellion, rather reluctantly.Unlike the original ""Apes,"" Burton seems content to throw in more action scenes than dialogue to tell the story.  There is very little social commentary really and the main story seems centered on how Helena Bonham Carter, as a loving ape who cares for the humans, helps Wahlberg in his attempts to save the other people from the evil Thade (a terrific Tim Roth). General Thade doesn't want the humans to rise up, because he'll lose his power as a ruler.But this is nothing new, however entertaining.  While the original pushed a few envelopes by raising social issues, some of them relevant today, and providing real characters, this ""Apes"" is mostly for show.  I liked the movie on its own terms, however.  It's enjoyable, looks great and has a twist ending that shows the trademark Burton imagination that we've come to expect.  In short, expect a few sequels.My Rating:  * * * (out of four)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

William Broyles's screenplay is interesting, but the dialogue has it's moments. A dear friend pointed out for me the low point in writing occurs when Leo (Mark Wahlberg) in an attempt to inspire the humans to battle the attacking apes he says ""Come on guys! We can take them..."" Whoa! Much of ""Planet of the Apes"" is like that. It has the trademark Burton brooding, dark settings-- great attention to detail. Though the story is in-cohesive and uneven. And there is some killer over-acting, particularly by Tim Roth as General Thade. Mark Wahlberg is okay as stranded astronaut, Leo, who wants to go home. Human activist, Helena Bonham Carter as ape Ari, is convincing in a strange ""romantic"" role. Liked Cary-Hiroyki Tagawa as Ari's protector, Krull-- the one really heroic character. All the other characters are forgettable. Even with these weaknesses in writing and acting, ""Planet of the Apes"" is definitely entertaining. It's pretty much an action picture with a slight social context-- very slight. You have great visuals, chases, explosions, and cool looking apes. Burton's reworked surprise ending is also worth staying for.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Tim Roth is great...Not worth the fierce hatred it's gotten, but still just average","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512813/?ref_=tt_urv","manalone923","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2753167/?ref_=tt_urv","28 November 2003","I'll state right off that this is a prime example of the burning backlash that resonated after this film's release: The Oscar for Best Makeup went to A Beautiful Mind. Apes wasn't even nominated!!! A SPECIAL Oscar was created for the original!!!And that's a problem. The costuming and, especially makeup, in the 2001 Apes is absolutely marvelous. But people nowadays just seem to despise the film, and Burton himself for having directed it. But this is not deserved, although I'll express my problems with it.The story in a nutshell resembles the original: A lone astronaut crashes on a planet ruled by talking apes, and must survive their prejudice against him. But whereas the original had a deeply philisophical plot and dialogue to provoke thought, the 2001 remake is little more than a glamorized chase scene, running too long.I believe Mark Whalberg is a fine actor, evidenced in films like Boogie Nights and the Yards. But here as main character Leo Davidson, he has little to do besides look awed and run away. Literally. There are some lines here and there suggesting what could have been deeper thoughts, but for the most part it's just plot city: React to the apes, run from them, find shelter, rally to defeat said apes. And the worst part is that the rest of the human characters are a mixed bag of nobodies, equivalent to what I call the ""Shirts"" of Star Trek lore. You know them, they're the extras who get killed defending the heroes whose names we actually know. Giving the humans the ability to speak does nothing more than hand them the chance to rebel more vocally. There's no explanation for why they can speak, and it doesn't really matter that they can. And worse, the fact that the apes are used to human speech takes away from one of the most powerful moments and subsequent scenes of the superior original, which of course is where Chuck Heston speaks for the first time.That does remind me of the fact that although there are a few too many silly puns (as with the original as well, to be fair), the opportunity to reference the original is met successfully too. Heston's famous line is mirrored by an ape this time, as is his famous last line from the first film. In fact Heston himself appears in a role built in irony: Not only does he play an ape this time around, but he also condemns the evil capacity of a gun, which must have made some of his NRA pals a little miffed.Aside from some fun moments like that, the movie's redeemable aspect is, of course, the apes themselves. Using the aforementioned excellent makeup, the actors in ape costume can now emote with the best of them. They snarl, sneer, smile, and speak mostly clearly. No more muffled sounds coming from the almost duck bill appliances that the 60's actors had to work with. The apes MOVE like apes too, loping about, running on all fours, using their feet to hold things. If the movie focused more on them and far, far less on the throwaway humans, the movie would have been much more enjoyable.
What I did like, or rather love about the film, was Tim Roth. I saw the film in the theater multiple times, directly due to Roth's portrayal of the cruel main ape, General Thade. This character absolutely lit up the screen when he was on, delivering lines with the cruel ferocity and impatience of a madman just brimming over with contempt. He has passionate, naziesque hatred of the human race, and makes it no secret that he longs to exterminate them in any way possible. Roth chews the scenery and loves every minute of it, and it surely makes for the most entertaining part of the film. He swaggers, swings, and essentially becomes the most believable portrayal of a primate that I've ever seen. My favorite scene in the film is when he grabs Whalberg's leg from under him, tripping him onto the floor with a crash without even looking at the human. He then jerks Whalberg up and bends him over his lap, to pry open his mouth and look inside to see if a soul exists. Satisfied that he sees nothing, he pitches Whalberg back onto the floor without looking, as one would do to a piece of wadded paper being tossed aside. It's good, energetic stuff, and gives the film a very dark edge that the original didn't quite have.I've established that the film consisted mainly of scenes with Whalberg and other humans running, escaping, and otherwise walking away from the ape city and any other real interest. Now for the ending..I won't spoil it, but I must say this. The original film had one of the best shock twist ending in history, and was a very tough act to follow. This time around, there are two main twists, none very adequately explained or built up to, and at the end the viewer isn't left with awe but rather a shrug, as he ostensibly thinks ""some of that was cool, but the ending was pretty lame and / or confusing."" And since Tim Burton said he'd rather jump out of a window than direct another Apes movie, we'll probably never have a follow up.
That's sad, considering that this movie WAS entertaining, but not really done right. The apes were very interesting, but at the sake of the expendable human characters. I left feeling as though the raw power and fierceness of the apes was represented, but not enough. And if the movie focused more on them, as I'd said, it would've been more entertaining. But I admit there would've been less story and conflict as well, so what can you do? Now if only General Thade was in it way more....Ahh, yeah.In closing, I found it a fun but disposable film. The original is still better and a way more engaging, thought-provoking film. The 2001 remake is kind of a more short-attention span flash-fest, with some fun stuff here and there but not much more to sustain your interest after a couple viewings. The makeup, costumes and scenery were great, and Tim Roth's General Thade was a blast. But past that, not too much to sustain interest. But I do maintain that it wasn't the horrifying, joke-and-cringe inducing wreck of flames that pop culture might be saying it is. Decide for yourself, but whatever you do don't blame Burton entirely. The man's done some great work, and he honestly tried. Besides, he didn't write the much-rewritten finished script.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

How could something that happened 300+ years into the future, on ANOTHER planet, change the entire evolutionary process on Earth, resulting in Abraham Lincoln becoming Ape-raham Lincoln??? This movie nailed it's own coffin shut, and stunk worse than the theatre loungechairs.

Burton's Planet Of The Apes reprise is ambitious, and ambitious undertakings are always subject to harsh criticisms by the unenlightened masses.Credit must be given to Tim Burton even if alone for coaxing out the single decent performance of Marky Mark's overabundant career.Superior performance by Helena Bonham Carter. Worth seeing again and again. The characters of Ari and her loyal companion the former general remain with you long after the film ends. As do many of the ancillary characters.
Rough transitions between model shots and CGI can be excused due to the studios refusal to grant director Tim Burton further time.
5 endings were shot and until postproduction concluded last week, just three days before release, no one was sure which Burton was electing to use. This DVD should be good. Burton is a masterful director. Here is a prayer for sequels.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

As for the ending, I don't see any difficulty in understanding it (although I'm not going to spoil it to anyone), it is just a pointless twist on the 1968 ending.

I want to cry because I am a huge Tim Burton fan and I have never been disappointed until now.  As everyone will agree, the visual effects and the makeup are amazing.  Rick Baker and crew deserve yet another Oscar.  However, this is where the compliments end.  Let's go down the list of things that I have a problem with:(1) The first 10-15 minutes on the space station looked too much like Buck Rogers for my taste.  Everything was too sanitized and too white. The acting made matters worse especially when it comes accompanied by lines like ""Never send a monkey to do a man's job.""(2) There was a long period after this where I was happy.  Once he landed on the planet things got better until they reached Calima and it turned for the worse.  Does anyone actually buy the idea that a 3,000 year old piece of equipment that crashed from space would work?  Oh yeah, that's right!  It's NUCLEAR powered.  I guess that the equipment itself would never corrode or rust.(3) Okay... the rest of the humans show up because they heard about the amazing human that will save them.  Uh?  Did I miss something?  Did he do something amazing that I'm not aware of?  At least in the original, Charlton Heston was the only human that could speak.  This ability made him stand out from the rest.  In this version, all humans could speak.  What's so great about Marky Mark?  That's right, he ""came from the stars"" to save them all.(4) Does anyone else find it extremely cheesy that a chimpanzee lands in a spaceship and saves the day?  Ridiculous.(5) The ending reminded me too much of ""Conquest of..."" and ""Battle for..""
I hope there is no sequel, but I'm sure there will be.  I just pray that Tim Burton does not shame himself again by directing the follow-up.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

What few special effects are in the movie (make-up, set design, and stunts are totally separate categories, and should never be included under the heading of ""visual effects"") could have been much better.  The ape makeup is Oscar-quality good, and is perhaps the only thing in the movie worth noting.The story seems like someone accidently dropped the screenplay into a wood chipper, randomly taped pieces of it back together, and then tried to shoot the movie from that: The story leaves us wondering too many things that are not explained, and most of what is explained is downright laughable.  This movie is funny when it tries to be serious, and never funny when it tries to be humorous.  I was so bored watching this, I tried counting (and lost track of) all the plot holes, but the big one at the end completely made me lose faith in this movie as anything but a 99-cent corner store rental to watch with your friends during a night of serious drinking games.Excellent talent like Tim Roth, Paul Giamatti, Michael Clark Duncan, and Charlton Heston (and even the far less-tolerable, media flavors-of-the-month ""Marky Mark"" Wahlberg and Helena Bonham Carter, whose names we probably won't even remember in two years) are wasted in this contrived piece of junk.  I never once felt anything for any of the characters in the film... except maybe sympathy for being trapped in such a lousy movie.This film is extremely unrealistic (even assuming that you accept the idea that evolved apes have formed a civilization, which itself is an excellent premise for a film, but a premise that could have - SHOULD have - been handled much better than this movie does it).In a summer boxoffice where intelligent dinosaurs roam, a misunderstood ogar finds love, and deceased Egyptians seek vengence, Planet of the Apes (2001) brings nothing of interest or quality to the table.  I usually come out of a big-budgeted, heavily-marketed, action/effects movie ready to get right back in line and see it again.  But this movie made me wish I'd never gotten in line to see it in the first place.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Planet of the apes is such a classic ground breaking film. It's a true masterpiece because it said more about ourselves & society then any other movie, so when you try and remake it your really asking for trouble. The expectations would be so high that such a film would be doomed for failure, which is kinda what happened.I don't care what anyone says, it's always a bad idea to remake a classic like Planet of the apes, hell look what happened to Psycho! it's just better off not to be remade. Heres why this movie ultimately failed: For one thing this really doesn't fit directors Tim Burton's resume. Tim Burton has done masterpieces like Edward Scissor Hands, Sleepy Hollow, Nightmare Before Christmas, Big Fish, etc. So how does a Sci-Fi Action movie fit his bill? I give him credit for having the balls to try but come on! The Lead character (Mark Whalberg) was stupid, Shallow, Arrogant, and bone headed. Whalberg could never fill in the shoes of the late great Charlton Heston. Heston was Larger than Life, Whalberg is kinda annoying in this film. Besides him most of the acting is shallow & over the top. Seriously the dialogue is ridiculous, were the screen writers monkeys or something. The best performances by far were Tim Roth & Michael Clarke Duncan, they were the only bright spots in the film. I thought the Make up was fantastic and worthy of Oscar consideration but that's it for the positive's of this film.I've heard from many people who like this movie and say don't compare it with the original. Of course were gonna compare it to the freaking original! They both have the same titles and similar story what do you guys expect!? My problem is that there are many references to the original, but this film lacks any soul or message that the original had. The original made a serious political statement on society and where were going in the future. This remake is basically a way to cash in. It lacks any of the magic of the original, It doesn't take itself seriously, there are way too many moments of comic relief, The ending made no F*****g sense, and it's just totally forgettable.Planet of the apes probably should have never been remade. Perhaps with a different director, and definitely different writers, a Remake could have been meaningful. Unfortunately this film is a major disappointment, and is totally forgettable. 10 years from now we will still be talking about the original, and the remake will be largely forgotten.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Lacking the originals social comment, and released at a time when the World's social ills and insurgency are less than in Charlton's '68 original, the film nevertheless provided good action sci-fi and a clever (if not a bit confusing) ending.HBC gave a good performance, and Roth probably outshone Wahlberg as the mean and devious Thade. A great looking film, well delivered by Tim Burton, who was the ideal director to carry the primate adventures into 2000.Burton brought subtle humour to the film (which I had anticipated being a lot darker than it turned out). The orang-utan love pastiche, the little girl as a pet, and the two card playing apes - one calling the other a ""Cheater"" (Cheetah).A lot of acknowledgements were given to it's father film. Several quotes and a cameo Heston. I preferred the fact that the apes on Burton's planet were unarmed, other than with clubs, the original (especially the TV series had them kitted out with all sorts of weaponry). It was a shame one of the original underlying mantra of ""ape shall never kill ape"" was dropped, but by and large it stayed relatively true to it's original.Overall: A good re-working. 8/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Burton's Planet of the Apes has great things (set design, matte' paintings, special effects and makeup) in it, but the story and pacing are disappointing.  The mood is too claustrophobic.  There are no interesting characters (Markey Mark the underwear model can't fill Heston's loin cloth). Cliche's are abundant.  Tim Roth's character is a little too evil and over the top.  The humans talk and have nothing to say. It would have been preferable to keep them mute like the original.  Maybe my point of view has been warped by the excellent 1968 version.  Burton's work ended up being one big jumbled mess.  I even took a short nap in the middle. My 12 year old son woke me up by grabbing my shoulder and when he saw I was dozing said ""oh my god.""  I guess he liked it (he actually called it ""OK"" as we departed the theater).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I thought it would give them some perspective and that it would be more accessible for there age group than 'Charlton Heston's' original. I was very disappointed as a result to find that this version changes the storyline so much that it doesn't fit with the newer films at all. Why can't you just leave things alone Mr Burton?In general though, it's not the worst film I've ever seen, but it put one of my nephews to sleep and the other barely looked up from his phone. I think if you take it as it was meant to be, which is a complete re-invention of the story, then you can watch it without any problems. I was just aggravated that I had to explain the original version to the boys so that they could understand how it fits in with the films that they already know. I also then had to explain this one too, based on my IMDB Trivia findings as I had no clue what was going on.Tim Roth probably gives the best performance, whereas the others all play themselves.I don't hate it and I would watch it again in the distant future, but I would hope that I remember that it doesn't fit with the other films.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

So I finally see it and when I came out of the theater I was very surprised about the ending it made me wonder like most people, but I won't say any more don't want to spoil it. Tim burton has done again just like with all of his other movies he has made in the past this one i think tops them all in my opinion his movies are in a eyecandy way oh and don't let me forget about the great Danny Elfman his music it so great I bought the soundtrack the next day, but I must say it's better then the original I mean Rick Baker did such a fantastic job on the make-up you would sometimes forget that those are actors up their with all this make-up on. I know that some people wouldn't agree but i hope that there is another Planet of The Apes so to speak sequel I would only see it only if Tim Burton direct's it.

Mark Wahlberg is the astronaut ""Leo"" who finds himself stranded on a planet that is dominated by apes that can speak. Just like their human relatives, the Simian community is facing a war. The more benign, cleverer, chimpanzees are facing a conflict with their more aggressive gorilla cousins led by ""Thade"" (Tim Roth). Luckily, ""Leo"" can count on the feisty assistance of ""Ari"" (Helena Bonham Carter) as they race their antagonists to a secret facility deep in the forbidden zone that could offer them a solution and reveal the nature of their past. Wahlberg is good in these action roles. He manages to keep the pace moving along despite a rather weak story that takes quite a while to establish itself, and then is all too procedural as it bumbles along to an admittedly lively and fitting denouement. It's not a great film, indeed was there really any need to remake it at all, save for it being a vehicle for the easy-on-the-eye star? Still, it's an above average production that passes two hours without effort. If you're really eagle-eyed you might spot ""Planet"" original Linda Harrison (in a cart) but that might be all this has to make it memorable.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Somewhat unstable director Tim Burton offers us a very dark, bleak and action-packed re-make.  Yes, it is a re-make despite all attempts to categorize as something other than.  Some wonderful characters here, including the best non-human villain in film history.  Tim Roth creates a truly evil being in Thade.  His walk and talk had me believing!  The sound, make-up and costumes are outstanding, and really had to be in order to pull this off.  Burton provides a few nice nods to the original, but none better than including Chuck Heston in a real flip of roles.  The usually outstanding Danny Elfman (yes, Jenna's bro) has some fine score moments, but overall a bit of let down.  Marky Mark is OK in the lead, but Estella Warren (from ""Driven"") is downright awful.  No other human has highlights in their hair!  Michael Clark Duncan (""The Green Mile"") is chilling as the sargeant of the ape army.  Again the sound comes into play everytime he speaks or roars.  Not really sure of the purpose of the ending. It is not a surprise ending, but I cannot tell if this is a tip of the cap to the original remakes, or if Burton thought he was providing a shocker. The ending kind of flops on both accounts.  But that should not prevent you from seeing the movie.  Just make sure you go to a big screen, with great sound!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It seems he rarely finishes a sentence during this explanation and for all the noise he makes, he doesn't say a single thing.

Leo finds himself on a new planet inhabited by various types of monkeys, all highly evolved and English speaking, which is a plus But they aren't alone on the planet. The jungles and remote areas around the monkey settlements are rife with humans, some more opinionated monkeys say 'infested'. Almost immediately upon landing on this new planet Leo is captured and bundled in with various other newly nabbed humans to be taken to Monktropolis (not really but it should've been) to be onsold to others.This is where Leo learns of the basic role reversal that this particular 'planet of the apes' experiences. The undisputed rulers of the land are all hairy and like bananas. Depending on their background or upbringing they all deem the humans as potential equals (best case scenario), slaves and house help (middling) or vermin to be exterminated (worst case).The obvious parallels between the current human / animal relationship is constantly and often clumsily highlighted, leading to 127 too many 'tee-hee, they're just like us' moments.After introducing the few main monkey characters including ruthless army leader Colonel Thade (Tim Roth), a slave trading orang-utan played by Paul Giamatti and his human friendly daughter Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), Davidson and a few humans escape from captivity and with Ari in tow head to the badlands, hoping to find answers to questions that needn't be asked.The last hour or so in this uneven two hour monkey-fest descends into a straight up actioner, and not necessarily a good one, the 'twist' ending straight up sucks and is likely the reason that a sequel wasn't even considered, and Burton shows that as a story-teller he does great visuals. Speaking of visuals, the sets are all immaculate and lush, the monkey makeup is for the most part excellent – especially Tim Roth – and the costumes are all well made, the CGI was wisely limited given the limitations of the time and doesn't stand out too much for the wrong reasons.But all the above merely makes Planet of the Apes an immaculately presented, well acted confusing and frustrating effort. After taking so long to ensure that Thade is the bad guy he is never called upon to do much with all his pent up rage and evil, and just why a monkey driven civilisation is such a bad thing is never addressed.After all, lying around scratching yourself and eating is hardly the worst way to go is it? Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. A couple of decent scenes and some creative visuals can't overcome a bland and often lost plot. Tim Burton does 'oddballs in outfits' better than most, not this time","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It didnt have the same shock values as the original... For example, the humans here could talk! And when Marky Mark 1st saw them, it was like ""oh, hey, these monkeys can talk... isn't that something?"" The visuals were impressive but thats it... The extras are cool... I tried not to compare with the original, but you cant help it. When in the original, Heston 1st noticed the apes running around in horses, it was like WOW!! Then when he speaks, it was like Oh oh... Here is like nothing. When Marky Mark asked some of the other humans stuff like ""Hey whats going on here?"" The humans where like ""Oh, well you see it's like this..."". The dvd has one of the things I hate the most... If you miss a line and cant understand what was said, you cant just pop the subtitles... You have to go to the main menu... Same for the sound...

It is absolutely gorgeous to look at.  The make-up, effects, cinematography, costumes and sets are all pretty hard to fault.  On the acting front, Tim Roth is utterly fantastic as General Thade and he just about makes up for the price of admission on his own.So what's the problem?  Well as much as I want Mark Wahlberg star to continue to rise, I just don't think he has the charisma to carry Charlton Heston's role.  Not that he was bad or anything, his acting is fine and he is certainly a lot better looking than Chuck ever was.  But is he really the brave and indignant leader of the human race who defies the apes and their dirty paws?  Maybe he would have been better as the plucky young male that defiantly chases after the hero (read George Clooney) after being told to stay behind with the others?But in Mark's defence, I don't think replacing him would have necessarily made the film any more satisfying.  This was a difficult film (conceptually) to make when you consider how highly the original is regarded.  Do you just remake it with the same emphasis of script and story, or if you are going to do something different, what do you change?So Burton does what he does best and creates a film that emphasises style over story, and action over acting (or actors).  It worked for Batman and I think it does for POTA.  Time will tell after the franchise has come and gone whether people criticise ""POTA Forever"" as not holding a candle to Burton's original!Enjoyable: 7/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Tim Burton's reimagining of Planet of the Apes shows clear signs of a muddled and often generic vision lacking any distinguished identity after a decade of development hell","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9508844/?ref_=tt_urv","IonicBreezeMachine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117926588/?ref_=tt_urv","22 December 2023","On the far reaches of the solar system in orbit around Saturn, the research station Oberon is performing experiments with genetically enhanced apes involving interstellar travel. When an electro magnetic storm emerges in the vicinity, one of the exploration pods is sent with an ape pilot to investigate and soon loses contact upon entering the field. The ape's handler Captain Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) against orders takes a pod and pursues and eventually crashes on an unfamiliar planet soon after. Leo finds himself on a strange world where Apes are the dominant species and humanity is enslaved. With the help of a sympathetic senator's daughter Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) and several human fugitives Leo traverses this unfamiliar world as the human hating General Thade (Tim Roth) pursues.In the mid-70s following five theatrical films, a live-action TV series, and animated series, the Planet of the Apes franchise entered into hibernation with only the occasional spin-off media such as comics or an unreleased Atari game being the only new entries. In the late 80s Adam Rifkin had earned enough clout with 20th Century Fox executives that he pitched a continuation of Planet of the Apes that would've featured the apes in a setting similar to Ancient Rome. This incarnation known as Return to the Planet of the Apes came very close to happening but changes in studio management caused creative schisms with Rifkin and the project was effectively dead but this began a cycle of various creative teams being attached to a new Planet of the Apes film for over a decade. In the intervening years between the original pitch and the ultimate release, several scripts and directors found themselves attached at one point or another including Peter Jackson, Oliver Stone, Sam Raimi, Chris Columbus, and James Cameron to name but a few, and routinely creative differences were the cited reason with creatives wanting to treat the premise as a serious science-fiction film while executives at Fox often made demands for outright farce or camp. Eventually at the end of the 90s, Tim Burton in a departure from his usual work was hired to direct and opted for a ""reimagining"" rather than a straight remake. Burton often clashed with Fox due to studio mandates and an accelerated production schedule to meet the July 2001 deadline, and Burton had such a terrible experience making the film when questioned about a sequel he was quoted as saying ""I'd rather jump out a window"". The film became a respectable success earning $360 million against a $100 million budget but critical reception tended to be mixed with praise going to the make-up and effects work while criticizing the story, characters, and ending. The 2001 Planet of the Apes film is great looking, but underneath it's a pretty empty and soulless experience.If there's anything to be said in defense of the 2001 version of Planet of the Apes, it's that it's a very handsomely mounted production with a unique take on the ape city and make-up work that allows for more distinguished character designs that helps stop them from blending together as had been an issue in the original Apes films. The movie's antagonist in Tim Roth's General Thade is also quite engaging (even if he goes very over the top at points) and he creates a memorable villain if nothing else. Unfortunately the actual meat of this movie in the story and characters is very sloppily assembled and has all the hallmarks of something that's been in development so long that they've crudely crammed what they have into a ""chosen one"" type hero narrative in order to give something just barely viable for the Summer movie season. Unlike the original where Humans were mute and feral, the humans in this incarnation are slaves and with the Apes' crude methods of securing and controlling the humans that seem really insultingly easy, it makes this world feel less tangible than the one minimally crafted over 30 years prior. We also have a very blank set of characters who aren't all that interesting and fall into vaguely defined archetypes (some of whom have names that aren't spoken aloud and I was reliant upon the credits to identify). Mark Wahlberg is an absolute charisma vacuum in the role of Leo and is one of the most bored looking and detached protagonists I've ever seen in a movie like this. Some of the work by the likes of Paul Giamatti, Michael Clarke Duncan, or Helena Bonham Carter is engaging, but the story is such weak and unengaging slog that it feels less like Planet of the Apes and more like a half-assed take on Stargate.Planet of the Apes certainly has the effects and budget to make something engaging, but it's fundamentally lacking in having a script or characters worth caring about. With spotty worldbuilding, an unengaging blank slate as a protagonist, and a story whose credibility is strained to a headscratcher of an ending (which according to Burton wasn't supposed to make sense and was just there as a sequel hook) Planet of the Apes is a movie where all the resources are on the surface and are in service of disguising hollow innards.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I wasn't heavily anticipating this remake, like about ninety-percent of the viewing public.  In fact, I predicted it would suck. For some reason, I'm not a sucker for all these big-budget Hollywood summer blockbusters.  I thought I'd feel the same way about this movie as I did with that borefest ""The Mummy Returns.""  Even action movies can put me to sleep, if flashy special f/x is the only fuel to keep them going.  But as it turns out fifty-percent of the time, the movies I least anticipate are the ones I end up liking quite a bit.  First of all, it's directed by Tim Burton.  I've always been fond of his work (minus ""Mars Attacks"").  Just like most of his movies, he creates a creepy atmosphere that deeply engages you--sometimes on a conscious level, sometimes on a subconscious level.  And also like most of his movies, he adds a nice touch of humor.  Some of the humor's pretty silly and obvious and some it's pretty subtle.  Whatever route he took, it often worked.  The ape costumes are amazingly realistic and the set designs are very impressive.  Also we have the great Danny Elfman who composed a great score to help intensify the creepy atmosphere.The premise is quite nifty.  A planet run by apes, where the apes rule and the humans are enslaved and put to work and even treated as pets.  That I found very interesting.  The premise is handled nicely, and it was amusing--sometimes hilarious--to see apes take on a human persona.  Playing card games, running shops, etc.In the comic relief department, we have Paul Giamatti who takes on the bumbling henchman role.  Just like his enormously impressive debut as Pig Vomit in Howard Stern's ""Private Parts"" he is absolutely hilarious.  Now, my mother saw this movie before me, so she pointed out that Charlton Heston had a cameo appearance.  Watching the film and seeing his name absent in the closing credits, I wasn't sure who he played.  I had a hunch he played Thade's father, and I was right.  The hint that sorta gave it away was when he quotes his famous ""Damn you all to hell"" speech on his deathbed.  I wonder if others caught on that it was Heston in that cameo, because I don't hear much buzz about it.  The story's not topnotch.  This is overall shallow, predictable entertainment, but it works.  I enjoyed it a lot more than expected, though it dragged at points (especially in the third act) and went on a little long.  Tim Roth is great as the villain.  If I didn't check the credits, I wouldn't have known it was him.  He didn't even use his British accent (something he's amazingly good at covering up).  And behind all that makeup, he's almost completely unrecognizable.  Though I haven't seen the original, I'm pretty sure Heston played a much better hero than Mark Wahlberg.  I don't think Wahlberg's a bad actor.  It's just, he's one of those actors who doesn't seem to go the whole nine yards for his craft.  He speaks in a moderately monotone voice, and never seems to have much substance behind his performances (even in his acclaimed role as Dirk Diggler in ""Boogie Nights"").  He's good in this movie, but they could've cast a better lead. Someone with a more commanding presence.  Please keep in mind I didn't see the 1968 version, so I might be a little sweet on this remake.  After seeing this version, I'm more anxious to check out the old version.  I heard a lot of buzz about this movie's ending. Though I didn't think it was a bad way to end things, it was...weird.  A little enigmatic.  Something you might have to ponder for a while.  Though it's nothing as subtle as M. Night Shamalyan's ending for ""The Sixth Sense."" Tim Burton really did an impressive job, this is another score for him. It's good, fun entertainment that doesn't take itself too seriously and leaves sufficient room for comic relief.  So I will recommend this movie, but if you're a die-hard fan of the original--please don't get on my case!My score:  7 (out of 10)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Why shouldn't they be? With the current level of sophistication we enjoy in special effects and advanced makeup/prosthetic applications there is no excuse whatsoever for shabby makeup and crappy effects. What are we left with after the glitz? Stuntmen jumping 20, 30 and 50 feet into the air again and again and again. That particular effect was so overdone throughout the film as to render it completely flaccid by the end of this piece of garbage. Plot? There was none, really.

They contain fantastical fairytale worlds inhabited by beautiful and strange beings. They have a degree of warmth regarding the beauty of the outsider. His almost baroque and gothic imagery are sublime within their own right, and the ultimate message of understanding and appreciating those who are different completes this magical composition. His wonderfully facetious dark and light humor dominate and charm audiences. None of these qualities were present in Planet of the Apes. Mark Wahlburg was an unsypathetic hero with very little character development or history. The same can be said for the rest of the cast sans the comic relief character of the slave trader. No magic here, except for the disappearance of Burton's usual artistic and unique vision. I honestly could not believe that he directed it.

This film was an absolute mess and should never have been made in the first place being a remake of a movie that didn't need one!Mark Wahlberg essentially plays the same character he played in THE BIG HIT (a blandly ""nice"" guy in some sort of trance), except this time he's landed on an ape planet in a small spacecraft which can miraculously keep track of what year it is when he goes through wormholes.  Of course he stumbles onto an advanced tribe of apes slightly better made-up than in the original, but at a technology level further back (these ones don't even have guns).  It isn't long before he's walking in Charleton Heston's footsteps in befriending an ape woman and, (sort-of) falling in love with a human woman, and leading a small revolt against the although this time around there isn't even a legitimate reason for him to be doing so.  The entire premise is completely ruined by changing it so that all the humans on the planet can talk and think at pretty much a 20th century level. The original PLANET was based around Charleton Heston trying to prove to the apes that humans were just as smart as they are, but politics and religion alike suppressed the historical truth.  This film has none of this. It's just a dumb action sci-fi movie with little action (most of the violence is off-screen, a la BATTLEFIELD EARTH - an eerily similar sci-fi disaster) and no plot! What semblance of a plot there is is completely ruined by the multitudes of red herrings, plot holes, and a general lack of depth in any area.  Never is the ape society really explored or revealed, nor are any of the characters fleshed out.  We never learn who the other servants are or why they bother tagging along with Wahlberg in the first place.  We never learn how many apes there are or why they have superior technology to humans.  For some unknown reason there are several different species of apes (Gorillas, Orangutans, Chimpanzees) on the planet, yet the ship they all originated from carried ONLY CHIMPANZEES!!   More uncalled for changes: They made the monkey women way too ""pretty"" in this one, not looking any different from normal women except for their hairy hands and big noses (most of them could actually probably pass for humans) and the human women are all in full make-up with manicures and perfect teeth... when the humans are supposedly living in the stone age!  I know it's just a movie, but COME ON!  How dumb do they expect us audience-members to be.This all wouldn't be so bad if the film hadn't resorted to so much useless parody, such as an ape saying ""Get your paws off me you damn dirty HUMAN"" or later when Charleton Heston's ape character says about humans ""Damn them all to hell!""...  my jaw just about literally hit the theater floor for that one.  What were the scriptwriters thinking?  Do they imagine the few of us who remember those lines from the original will be amused at all by this mutilation of the franchise.  I think even BATTLE FOR... was better... at least the ending of that movie made sense!  I'm not going to ruin it for you but the ending really surprised my by how awful it really was... not that I couldn't see it coming miles away but I honestly never imagined the writers would be THAT tacky.I'm usually very forgiving watching bad sci-fi movies, but this one was WAAAY below lowest common denominator...insulting to my intelligence, confusing, AND boring.  It hasn't been since I watched BATTLEFIELD EARTH or STAR WARS EPISODE 1 that I have sat in the theater completely appalled at what I was watching.  Let's pray that this disaster acts as a career killer for director Tim Burton.  He's made a few very good movies but the magic is over.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The ending is so bad that it effects the whole plot of the movie and made me give this movie 4/10.If the ending would have been different, would have made a little bit of sense, then it would possibly get a higher score.Please write me if you think this writing is out of the blue, or even smack down in the middle of the blueÁgúst Kr, IcelandP.S. pardon my spelling","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"10","/10","2001 POTA in-depth Review!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512772/?ref_=tt_urv","Movie Nuttball","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1132073/?ref_=tt_urv","22 February 2003","Many people think that the original 1967 Planet of the Apes is a classic and a master piece. Sure its one heck of a film especially back in the day when it was made. It had great costumes and makeup with great music by Jerry Goldsmith and a tremendous shocking end. This Planet of the Apes has awesome costumes and very realistic makeup and/or masks. The music is outstanding by Danny Elfman and the 2001 version has even a more shocking end. It seems to Me many people are against or hate this POTA. I really don't know why, it has such an interesting cast and they play their parts very well and sure it may not be director Tim Burton's darkest film but in My opinion it is one heck of movie! The way I see the film it has a lot of emotion and all of the characters are so likable. I'll try to explain this as best as I can about Helena Bonham Carter is a very good looking woman and her character Ari is beautiful. I know she is under tons of makeup and looks very realistic as an ape but whenever she is on screen I can't help but think how neat she is with her voice and personality. Tim Roth's Thade is an awesome character and his character deserves a lot more credit. Roth's performance is truly menacing. Charlton Heston put on another solid performance as Thade's father. Another thing that gets into this movie so much is the music. Each scene is so great with the fantastic score! Below is in My opinions an in-depth look at most of the characters that is in the 2001 Planet of the Apes!-------------Mark Wahlberg as Captain Leo Davidson - Leo Davidson, after the incident of going after Pericles he is stranded on another world thanks to a magnetic storm. The planet he lands on has unbelievable talking apes. He is prisoner but after Ari frees him he gets to know her and her mentor, Krull and some other humans. He joins these two different factions of intelligent species and travels to the forbidden area Calima! Leo is out for himself and to go back home as soon as he can!Tim Roth as General Thade - The great General Thade, a mighty warrior who is afraid of nothing. His mean voice sends shivers down his soldiers back and he hates humans to death!Thade and Ari were once in a relationship but now Ari has other things to do. He loves his father Zaius very much and he is very saddened about his father's illness. Helena Bonham Carter as Ari - She is a beautiful ape and very intelligent as well. She helps Leo escape. She is through with Thade and even though she has feelings for Leo even though he is human. She loves Krull as he is her mentor and in fact he is with Ari all the way with her,Leo,and other escapees from the city.Michael Clarke Duncan as Colonel Attar - The huge Attar is a force to reckon with! He is General Thade's great warrior and best friend. He is a very religious and serious ape.Paul Giamatti as Limbo - The always funny Limbo loves to smell and look good. The human keeper if you will takes his job seriously but when he is forced to follow the escapees his life turns around. Estella Warren as Daena - One of the many prisoners in Ape City,Daena wants out just as much as everyone else but when she meets up with Leo and escapes with the group she has feelings for him but much like he does for Ari he doesn't think much of it. She loves her father Karubi very much and she is shocked and very sad about his death.Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa as Krull - The massive Krull was one of the greatest warriors and a brave leader. He is the mentor of Ari and he is one of the apes who is in the escaped group. His favorite weapons are swords and handles them excellently!David Warner as Senator Sandar - Ari's father, Senator Sandar let Thade have control. He is an ape that believes in manners such as washing hands. He tries not to get on Thade's case and he loves his daughter Ari.Kris Kristofferson as Karubi - The father of Daena,Karubi loves his daughter very much. He is a brave human man but his death in a fight against Attar didn't last long and he never knew what hit him from behind which it was General Thade.Thade's sword decapitated him.Erick Avari as Tival - The male house human is one of the escapees in the group with humans and apes.Luke Eberl as Birn - A stubborn teenager, Birn is a brave young man.Evan Dexter Parke as Gunnar - Another escaped male human. He too is brave.Glenn Shadix as Senator Nado - The great senator Nado. He loves his job and his mate!Freda Foh Shen as Bon - The female house human is one of the escapees in the group with humans and apes.Chris Ellis as Lt. General Karl Vasich - Leader of the Oberon.When the magnetic storm caused malfuctions in the ship a video image played on the monitor. Little does he know that what he just saw was himself in the future!Anne Ramsay as Lt. Col. Grace Alexander - She really cared for the modern day apes in the Oberon.Lisa Marie as Nova - Senator Nado's mate. She is very attractive for an ape and she is always worried about her looks.Linda Harrison as Woman in Cart - Could it be possible that this woman was on another planet at another time or in another lifetime? Could it be that she is reincarnated?Charlton Heston as Zaius,Thade's Father - Thade's father is very ill. Before he passes he wants to make sure to tell and show his son the shocking truth about humans.---------------I just like how everything is in the film. The ending may have been rushed and not make sense to others because it really had several endings but Burton could only pick one. In fact you can also tell as great as the music is if you listen closely some of the tracks are alternatives than the released music on the CD. Also a short time before the final release of the film the producers wanted the movie to be more epic than it was and they wanted it to be like or more like Gladiator and back to the music they wanted the composer Danny Elfman to change the music. I thought it was silly for the movie makers to do that and I am glad it came out the way it did even if the ending is sad and is a mistake or an error. I hope you have enjoyed this in-depth look at Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes. Like I said I love the 2001 version!","13 out of 24 found this helpful.

That is what I remember mostly about the original; Charlton Heston was desperate to prove he was intelligent.  I remember just feeling helpless concerning his plight, and aching for him to succeed.  I would have felt the exact same way had that angle been explored more in this remake.  Helena Bonham Carter's character doesn't go through that discovery, she believes in the intelligence of humans right away it seems.  That fact alone made this version of ""Planet of the Apes"" far inferior to the original.  Instead of just making it look more sleek, Tim Burton should have been more concerned with this thematic element, an element that in my opinion made the original so compelling.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As my wife put it, they had so much to work with, and they completely blew it. I don't even know where to begin with how disappointing this movie was.The action sequences were non-existent. Times when there should have been a good scene (like the horse-ride through the camp, which could have been really great) were very detached from the action, and consequently quite boring. Both the cinematography and the editing in such scenes were really, well, bad.The acting was stiff. I guess Burton was trying to do this whole thing where people actually moved like apes. But that was annoying. And they seem to have spent two or three times as much time and effort on that as they did on more typical (and effective) elements of acting--you know, emotions, character development, little things like that.The CGI was pretty transparent. When Marky Mark first lands and is standing in the forest looking around, for example, it's SO clear that he's in front of a bluescreen. Ugh. The makeup, on the other hand, was really well done.The score was stifled, I thought. But maybe it was just because it had nothing decent to accompany/illuminate.I expected more cool references to other movies. 2001 was a completely obvious allusion, for example, and they only made one (probably accidental) allusion to it--when Pericles is about to take off in the pod. They could really have done a lot of cool stuff with that--both on the planet and in space. So, what was good about the movie? The makeup, as I already mentioned. That's it, as far as I can recall. Enjoy.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

They were movies that were unique to their time. The 1970's were the only decade where a franchise like the Planet of the Apes could thrive. Fast-forward 25 or 30 years and Tim Burton's ""Planet of the Apes"" is a much harder sell. Burton's ""Planet of the Apes"" is a mixed bag. The action parts of the movie work quite well. The comedic parts of the movie fall flat. Most of the ""laughs"" are found in the first third of the movie. That also happens to be the weakest part of the film. It's Paul Giamatti's job to deliver those laughs but he ends up being annoying and not funny. If director Tim Burton and company had played it straight, ""Planet of the Apes"" would have been much better.

Most of the sets are original and the actors' stint in ""ape school"" has paid off. The ape characters walk, move, and even fidget like apes, chimps, and orangutans, and the actors blend their movements seamlessly into their performances and the scenes. No one seems to be saying ""Look at me! Look at me!"" (with the exception of Charlton Heston). Helena Bonham Carter and especially Tim Roth give standout performances.Unfortunately, most of the effort that went into making the film is wasted: very little seems to happen and there isn't much suspense. The humans escape from confinement too easily and then have a pretty clear path to their final destination. The explanation for the evolution of a planet of apes is a good one, both surprising and plausible. But then this explanation is quickly followed by a brutal yet lame battle sequence. The film's ending is a shocker, but more of the head-scratching than the jaw-dropping kind. Ultimately, this movie underlines the greatness of the 1968 version.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

On its own, however, this is a pretty good sci-fi action film complete with a little character development (for those who need that).In my opinion this movie did parallel the original in terms of certain basic plot points (sorry, no spoilers), but I think the parallels can get lost in the translation/interpretation.What I didn't like was that I had to be prepared for the ending by those who had the DVD commentary; we're supposed to leave the movie in a state of ""Huh?"", and we're supposed to assume a certain event took place which is just barely eluded to at the very end.Besides being rude, this may or may not set things up for a sequel. The original movies managed to create a final ""setting-up"" for a perfect cycling in time. Maybe we didn't get a perfect happy ending, but we left satisfied about the reasons behind the first movie's social setting.I believe that a sequel has to be made to explain *clearly* why the movie ended as it did. I think there's too much arrogance behind the current ending; someone is ignoring the population of viewers who aren't well versed in sci-fi versions of warps, portals, etc.Hint: When Thade finds himself in what looks like a control room pay attention to what he sees. And remember that he's no idiot.

I'll start first with the character development. There is none. Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg)is so one dimensional that at no point did i care if he ever got off the planet and back to, well, whatever and whomever. His entire time is spent throwing out cliched lines instead of being awed, inspired, terrified, or confused of his surroundings. Any emotion would have worked. As for the humans who live on the planet, I'm not sure what their problem was, they werent savages, they outnumbered the apes supposedly, they could communicate at the same level as the apes (unlike the original movie), so why exactly were they living in the hills scared for their lives. Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) and General Thade (Tim Roth) are by far the most interesting, and well acted, characters.  Miss Carter brings a sensual aspect to her character that is very appealing (yes, i know shes playing a simian, but it doesnt seem to matter). While Mr Roth plays Thade deliciously evil and cunning, and his ape-like movements are a sight to see.I was especially disappointed with the relationship between Leo, Ari and Daena (played by model Estella Warren, who is way to beautiful here to pull off a role as a jungle woman). There are obvious hints of attraction between Ari and Leo, yet these scenes go absolutely nowhere in developing the awkwardness of it all. The script doesnt go beyond yearning glances, which is a shame. The last half hour of the movie was basically the standard action plot. The movie builds up to an inevitable war between the humans and the apes, with Leo devising this absurd plan to stun the first ranks (out of thousands of CGI created apes) with the remnants of his old ships ignited fuel tanks. Never mind the fact this would only eliminate maybe 5 percent of the total forces they are up against. The final conflict is never exciting, but then how could it be when we have no emotional investment in the characters.I will not discuss the ""surprise"" ending, except to say not only is it not surprising, it doesnt make sense, and i defy anyone to explain it.In fact, i read an interview with the higher-ups involved in this fiasco, and they revealed that the ending isnt supposed to make sense, its supposed to leave the viewer confused and guessing. Well, thats just what i want after watching this for two hours, and ending that insults the viewers intelligence by admitting ""we didnt even care enough ourselves to give you a plausible ending."" Thank you Hollywood. And thank you Tim Burton, for reminding us once more that classics should be left alone and time honored. If you're going to remake a movie, remake a bad movie. In fact, remake this remake.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Burton does well to convey the Wahlberg character's sense of desolation after crashing on the planet and an interesting subplot ensues, involving Helena Bonham Carter's ape character and the attempt to escape from their masters. Tim Roth is absolutely outstanding as the general - you won't see a more expressive pair of eyes! The love triangle element with Estella Warren's character (what a beauty!) is also fairly well handled.The film simmers along nicely for the first half and then completely degenerates towards the end. The first absurdity is when (*SPOILERS AHEAD*)Wahlberg's monkey jets in and stops the battle - the scene just looked silly, it did not look like it could turn the tide of the battle...then later the henchmen (sorry henchapes!) of the general capitulate too quickly without really being convinced.And the ""twist"" ending was just well...incomprehensible I thought...another writer here said he found it easy to understand because it was a take on the original film's ending....but for someone like me who hasn't seen the original, I just thought - huh? Was it meant to be a ""what-if?"" scenario, or was it a direct consequence of what had happened before? I couldn't get my head around it...maybe I'm thick...need to think about it a bit more, but I suspect that I still won't get it...Overall - a good first half to the movie....great performance from Roth and Wahlberg was good too...Burton got the visual style of the film spot on and the costumes and ape make up were just awesome and any special fx used looked good...unfortunately, plot holes and inconsistencies in the second half of the movie undid all the good work and effort put into the rest of the film.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Estella Warren is a definite hottie.  Tim Burton's direction, the sets, the fx, and the makeup were all great.  There are some really cool action scenes, especially at the final battle.  And although the ending isn't fully explained, it was a cool little twist reminiscent of the original's ending (though not as good) and it was something that audience members both heavily thought and argued about.

I often feel that people just jump on the bandwagon when they slate it, especially the hardcore Burton fans. It's certainly not a great movie, nor is it a bad one.Visually it's amazing, as with any Burton film. The sets are spectacular, the CGI is convincing and not burdensome and the ape make-up/costumes look truly realistic and in some cases, menacing, particularly the character of Thade. Danny Elfman's musical score is suitably brooding and savage and I think the slew of weird percussion sounds is inspired. The acting is good, with stand-out performances from Tim Roth, who is the perfectly grotesque Burton villain, and Paul Giamatti, providing light relief.The story and script seem to be the main culprits for all the controversy. I actually like the fact that there is little dialogue. Sometimes movies suffer when there is too much dialogue, as it just becomes convoluted. Although Planet of the Apes is nowhere near as profound as Kubrick's 2001, this is the perfect example of 'pure cinema'. There is not one word of dialogue until 40 minutes into the film. Not everything needs to be explained with dialogue, a picture paints a thousand words, as the saying goes. As for the ending, it's more true to the novel. I will say that the Ape Lincoln memorial makes a mockery of the film, which is a fabrication and NOT in the novel. Although there is humour throughout the film, the ending loses its impact as a result of Burton's outlandish joke.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The producers knew what they could sell; good visuals and the Planet of the Apes name, and that is all they deliver. This movie is only about how it looks.  If you care about story or characters (the makers obviously did not) you should look elsewhere.The half thought out plot has holes you could push a planet through.  Tim Burton tries to paper some of the holes with action cliches, most of which are embarrassingly bad.As to the cast, Mark Wahlberg is not bad in the lead, but the rest of the cast saved their good work for another film.  Tim Roth badly overplays the villain, General Thade.  Helena Bonham Carter is just there as the pro-human chimp Ari.  The rest of the cast has so little to work with, that they must have collectively said to themselves, ""why bother?""Then there is the surprise ending.  It is a total waste of film.  While the ending of the original (and far better) Planet of the Apes was integral to the story, the surprise in this new version has that unmistakeable ""tacked on"" feel.  It comes out of nowhere, goes nowhere, and does not make sense at all.  It is as if the film makers wanted a visual surprise ending for no other reason than that the original had one, but that they didn't want to put very much thought into creating it.That is the overriding problem with this movie.  It goes for the easy sell visual, without putting any thought behind it.  As a result, it is only good for shutting off your brain for two hours.  If that's all you want from a movie, go for it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

He gives us foreshadowing, atmosphere, and a sense of reality.He did none of those with this movie.I wanted to like this film; I really did.  In fact, most of the movie was enjoyable.  I found that the apes moved realistically, or at least as one would expect, Tim Roth was a good villain - if more than a bit flat - and that the religious element was delicate but not underdeveloped.However, at about thirty-forty minutes from the end of the film, things fell apart.Characters show up for no reason; we are spoon-fed that which the viewer can already deduce; romance is conjured out of nowhere.  Tim Burton could have made this a satire, but instead he made it an action movie that pales in comparison with even a Steven Seagal vehicle.There is no atmosphere, soul, or logic to the film.  If you liked Burton's other movies, by all means do not see this one.And wow, the ending.  I overheard someone mention Rod Serling's name on the way out.  I can tell you, if I had known who said that, I would have looked at him and told him that Twilight Zone endings were foreshadowed, consistent, and above all else, MADE SENSE.  The movie doesn't even play properly within the logic it sets up for itself.I went into this with higher expectations than I should have.

No, I didn't. THIS MOVIE SUCKED!!!! There, I added an extra exclamation mark! When I came out of the theater, I was so embarrassed for having seen it, I was praying that no one I knew would be there to recognize me. The last time I remember having that feeling was when I came out of Caligula back in the early 80's.I really can't hardly figure out where to begin because the number of insanely, ludicrously, mindless flaws in logic (or is it ludicrously, mindlessly, insane) were so overwhelming that I truly thought anyone with an IQ of over 60 would NEVER admit to liking this movie. Incredibly, there are actually humans that know how to type (unless some ape is doing it for them) on this web site who liked this pile of garbage.I'm serious. I don't even want to waste time on the number of impossible coincidences and ridiculous plot holes and staggeringly insipid assumptions that were made. It was cheesy, predictable, boring, stupid, insulting and, did I say MINDLESS?The ape costumes were decent, but decent special effects nowadays are assumed. The rest of it was pure, unadulterated junk. IF you have even half a brain, you will be terribly disappointed. If not, have fun and bring your banana.

This was the first time I had ever waited in a line to see a movie.  It was especially noteworthy because I live in a moderate size town. The stuntmen in this movie seem to be trying out for ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"".  At the same time they made it look very simian.  I thought this movie was well done.  It is a little too dark most of the time but I'm pretty sure this is on purpose.  There is one problem with this movie that I noticed.  Actually I've been noticing it for years.  That problem is the adolescent actor (in this case Luke Eberle).  For the past years both televison and Hollywood have written two main types of characters for adolescent actors.  In the first type the adolescent character is told to: go in the house, go over there, etc.  Why is it that the ""adult"" actors are afraid for the adolescent characters to be an integral part of the defense of the home or whatever the movie entails.  The second type is where the adolescent character either is allowed to help or just does.  However, the ""adult"" character either has to fix what the adolescent character did or save the adolescent character from death etc.  This movie is no different.  In it the Luke Eberle character is basically told to go hide by Mark Wahlberg.   The Luke character then refuses and decides to try and help.  Then in typical fashion the Mark Wahlberg character has to save the Luke character from certain death.  When is the establishment and the ""adult"" actors going to realize that adolescent characters actually can  help in defense situations and many other situations as well?  I realize that many of these adolescent actors have not ""paid their dues"" yet but to me that is a terrible reason to perpetuate a stereotype.  For that is indeed what it is.  So even though this movie perpetuates both of these stereotypes I think it is still a rather good movie.  However, it could have been better had the writers filled the stereotype spot with something important.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I had a high expectation for it too. It's a shame. I'll give the make-up artists (e.g., Rick Baker) credit. Bravo. And Danny Elfman's opening score was interesting. But otherwise, this movie was utter crap. (small spoilers follow) First we get this DS9-like space station shot with the wonderful title card that informs us that it's the year 2029!!! Hello! I knew right then that this was going to suck. Science fiction needs to be smart. Then he finds himself on the Ape Planet and the next 90% of the movie is just simple ""escape and chase"". Yawn... But to try and make it interesting they throw in some cliché and ever-not-so-subtle comments on racism and religion. The script was lousy, let's face it. Then the end of the movie improves slightly (this doesn't say much) until we get the ""surprise"" ending. Whatever. Tim Burton has the imagery skills but except from Edward Scissorhands and Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, I'd say he's a failure as far as making good stories. The similarities between Planet of the Apes and Battlefield Earth are remarkable. And considering how lousy that movie was, why would anybody allow this script to pass? Certainly a better movie could have been made from the same idea. Oh well, it already has.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"9","/10","With all of the bungling, protracted, witless summer movie sequels invading theatres, you've gotta wonder when Hollywood's going to stop monkeying around.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512717/?ref_=tt_urv","chrisbrown6453","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0625436/?ref_=tt_urv","21 June 2002","Ah, Planet of the Apes. Sniff it all you want; it smells enough like a case of the remake to fall in line with this summer's sequel monotony, but upon closer inspection, it's clear that this is a chimp of a decidedly different breed.Director Tim Burton reinvents the aesthetic and tonal gestalt of the 1968 classic without ditching the original's thematic underpinnings, creating a world that is both visually fascinating and painstakingly complete.
When Air Force pilot Leo Davidson, (Mark Walberg), leaves his space station in search of a test chimp deployed to survey a magnetic storm, things go awry, leading to a crash-landing on a planet where humans are enslaved by a breed of apes that are uniquely advanced, cognizant and cultured. But their refinement is little more than a thin veneer hiding their aggressive animal drives, which can lead them to the brutal treatment of their captured humans. Leo, who isn't acclimated to the Apes' tyranny, revolts against them and becomes a heroic figure and leader to the enslaved humans who know little else than the servitude and submission they have faced since birth. Helena Bonham Carter (you know, from Fight Club) plays Ari, an ape with compassion towards humans, while Tim Roth brilliantly portrays Thade, a snarling, aggressive (really pretty damn scary) ape general, who wishes to see his planet cured of humans, and his fellow apes cured of their human-derivative tendencies.Under the façade of a fast-paced sci-fi/action blockbuster lays an entirely different animal. On the most primitive level, Apes is gargantuan, pounding its fists with energy and a capacity to amaze that makes this film monumentally entertaining. But like the skillfully crafted latex ape masks through which the actors' subtle, universal, seasoned human facial expressions are transmitted, Apes breathes life of its own beneath the glaze of action. Burton paints a textured portrayal of man's struggle against subjugation, with settings and characters that are unearthly, yet dually dark, gritty and present. The director ditched the early-proposed ideas of digitally animated apes or live apes with computer-generated mouths, enlisting A-list actors instead to give each ape a uniquely human core.Perhaps the real feat here is that Burton was able to make these apes so utterly creepy and animalistic (much more so than their original counterparts) yet still found a way to maintain their human characteristics. Roth and Bonham Carter learned an entire behavioral language for their roles, complete with loping, off-kilter strides and dexterous, long-armed gesticulations. It takes a while to get a grasp of the full complexity of their movements, but once the language is understood, you quickly see how the ape dispositions intensify the actors' capacity for human emotional expression.Other apes include Limbo, a pandering human-slave dealer played by Paul Giamatti, and Attar, Thade's loyal silverback, played by Michael Clarke Duncan (who incidentally, is perhaps the only Ape actor that sounds as though he's using his normal voice). Charleton Heston makes a cameo, donning full ape regalia to play Thade's dying father, and Lisa Marie Pressley appears briefly as a snooty socialite chimp.On the human side, two words: Estella Warren. She says close to nothing (perhaps a throwback to the mute humans in the original, perhaps not). With a character that grows envious of the affection formed between Walberg and Bonham Carter (yes, a man and a chimp) Warren is left to primarily convey her dissatisfaction through looks and body language. And looks plus body are a definite can-do on Warren's checklist. Things seems a little exploitative at times; her garb is close to non-existent, and the camera, perhaps a bit too kind, but Warren certainly helps heighten the degree to which this film is visually fascinating. Unfortunately, it isn't all bananas and cream pie. The Apes script incorporates a few narrative devices that are just too convenient, such as the illogically timed event that causes the wrap-up to the climatic battle scene. Although the majority of dialogue in the film runs smoothly, certain characters (take for instance, the shifty-eyed comic relief, Limbo) are developed in a stagnant and predictable way. Walberg's pre-battle scene speech, despite its relative brevity, is still a little laughable. The re-vamped surprise ending is creatively done, carrying certain light-heartedness to it, but the film leaves things too easily opened ended. However, with a sequel planned 'open-ended' is something that was planned.
Ultimately, Burton's overall design is so meticulous and aesthetically comprehensive and his ape characters, so believable and culturally complete that you can't help but be lured into his stunning visual world, which seems (if not only momentarily) to take precedence over other concerns. You haven't seen anything quite like this. The film may have aped the original, but it stands on its own two feet.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

This world is ruled by talking apes who treat human beings as slaves and the astronaut must find a way to escape the monkey madness and mayhem.Remake, re-imagination whatever you'd like to label it as, Planet of the Apes (2001) is inferior to the original 1968 film and as a standalone piece of entertainment in almost every way.That said, the make up is excellent, Tim Roth as Thade is fantastic, Colleen Atwood costumes are notable and Danny Elfman's thumping score is an achievement. The spaceship sets and on the location night scenes have a unique atmosphere and edge about them. Even Mark Wahlberg tries his best to handle the half-baked script and there are a few welcomed cameos from some of the original cast. On the flip side there's some choppy editing, an uneven story, the ape city and the sandy finale are emotionless and uninspiring. Slipped in is some unnecessary humour, usually supplied by Paul Giamatti (aptly named Limbo) and you never feel any danger or threat from the apes apart from Thade. Also, there's no likable characters to really root for. Nothing can save nominated director and visionary Tim Burton's incarnation of Apes.The fist ten minutes and the last two are probably the most attention-grabbing of this version but with an estimated budget $100,000,000 there's no excuse for the travesty in between.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Being a child of the 80s, I recognize that some sequels are inherently superior to others (i.e. Star Wars films, Indiana Jones, but not _Temple of Doom_, and others), so I tend to be suckered into repeats.So I purchased my $5 IMAX ticket (thank you, Canada) and was eager to see the newest addition to the _Apes_ saga.  From the first scene the sound and special effects are great.  You get wrapped into this film quickly and intensely.  You are, in fact, held throughout the entire film.Burton, as usual, has created a very, very dark film that seems to offer no hope for salvation.  Characters become aware of their ""sins"" and misconceptions of reality.  The battle seen of ape vs. man shows the reduction of man to his survivalist instinct, and a hope, albeit distant, for reconciliation.Most films would have stopped there.  Kudos to Burton for going further, but where did he think he was going to take us?  A great film was RUINED by the ending.  Too predicable, too ""I need an ending, let's go with this one.""

My friends told me how great the original was and i could only think of how awesome a writer must be to create such an original story.  Oh, i was a fool.Burton has had a successful streak, hasn't he?  Batman, Batman Returns, Sleepy Hollow, and the cult favorite Nightmare Before Christmas.  Yes it is an awesome life.  But every career has a hitch.  This is his.  Mark Wahlberg's career has also been rising.  From the innovative Boogy Nights, to the highly rated Three Kings and The Perfect Storm with another blockbuster (Rock Star) on the way.  Maybe this can be an oversight.No matter the director or the stars, our hero, Leo Davidson cannot see that his ape costars are real actors.  Whenever speaking to them, he inserts a short pause, as if trying to prove to himself that these are real people. His eyes are blank and emotionless.  He plays a hero just as well as Steven Seagal, take that as you will.The apes are frighteningly lifelike, but you can't base a movie on its makeup.  The film is dark, very dark (visually) for the first 3/4.  As if these future apes couldn't figure out lightbulbs, or even gas lights.  The film also uses the rope and pulley system made popular by the Matrix.  While it looked new and exciting in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and even Romeo Must Die, seeing apes jumping vertically eight feet (from a sit down) is just silly.None of the ""human"" characters, beside Leo, play an important role.  It makes you wonder why he's trying to save them.  Apes have evolved into intelligent, thought processing individuals over thousands of years... but what happened to the humans?  Did we just stop at a certain point in time, and someone said, ""This is enough for you""?  The ending is so confusing it's physically impossible.  Burton rearranges time so much i think HE get's lost.  Overall, it's a 4/10- saved by the makeup and the ape's acting.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Don´t read if you didn´t see the movie yet!At first I have to say that I didn´t see the original movie yet (shame on me!) but I don´t consider this to be important for this review. As I´m a Tim Burton-Fan, I had to watch the new ""Planet of the Apes"" - and I liked it.It is a great movie, full of fantastic pictures - the great comic-style, which I love Tim Burton for. The soundtrack is perfect, the special effects are great and , what is the most important: the story is very entertaining and full of suspense.Of course, as many of you did, you could ask many logical questions as: - Why are there horses on the planet? - Why are there different races? - How is it possible for a few humans and two apes to ride through a complete camp of aggressive apes? - Why does the chimp land exactly at the moment when Leo is about to lose his fight? - How is it possible for a small spaceship, to fly from the planet of the apes back to the earth? And why does it only take three minutes? - Why does Estella Warren wear lipstick? - Why is the earth full of apes at the end?I read many questions like this, and of course there are many more you could ask! But please don´t forget, it is a fantasy movie! A fantasy movie doesn´t need to be realistic, and it also doesn´t want to be!Nobody asks why it is possible to hear noises, when space ships in Star Wars shoot at something - although it is impossible to hear noises in space! A fantasy movie lives of exaggerations! Why do you always bother about realism in fantasy films? If you want to watch a realistic movie, then you should watch a drama or something, but no fantasy or science-fiction movie! - Or at least, don´t wonder about exaggerations!Of course it was not a perfect movie. Mark Whalberg really didn´t act very well, and I often asked myself why Estella Warren is in this movie. She is always in the middle of the plot, looking beautiful but speaking only five sentences over the whole movie.But altogether it was a very nice movie. I will have to buy the DVD as soon as it is available!Therefore 8 out of 10.Well, I think I will watch the original movie soon, but I´m not looking forward to compare the movies!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

When I heard about this flick, I though that this ""re-imagining"" would be at least visually better than the original film. Well, it's not. The new makeup is more complex than the appliances used in the firs film, but the apes are grotesque. Ari, for instance, has hilarious ape features, and so David Warner's character. The problem, I think, is the ""realistic"" sculpture of the masks, made by Rick Baker. I don't know if ""realism"" is a good choice in a movie called ""Planet of the Apes"". The general concept is quite bizarre, and realism can make things even worse.In the original, the characters looked like apes, but had a more sophisticated appeal, a noble aspect. It's very difficult to achieve this balance, and perhaps it explains why the makeup of the new ""Planet"" wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Add to that a bunch of apes running like rabbits, ""primitive"" humans that think and talk like evolved humans and poor sets, and you have a natural looser. But what really upset me about this film is the title: it should be ""THE VISITOR"", as Burton had originally envisioned. ""THE VISITOR"" is more accurate in the sense that the movie is a ""re-imagining"", not a remake.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Well, when Tim Burton (the genius behind the secrets of the masterpiece THE NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS) signs on to do a project like PLANET OF THE APES, you just know it's going to be good. The actors are very well cast and everyone fit into their parts perfectally. But, for some very odd reason, most people found this wonderful version to PLANET OF THE APES to be a disappointment. I can't see why, because I enjoyed the film to no end. In my opinion, it couldn't have been made better. This really doesn't seem to me like a project that Tim Burton would sign on to direct, but hey, he did it. And did it well.
Mark Wahlberg is tremendous here, and so are remaining cast members: Tim Roth, Michael Clarke Duncan, Helena Bonham Carter, David Warner, Kris Krisstoferson, Chris Ellis and lots more. If you haven't figured it out already, I was entranced by this film.The usual action-adventure will place you in an environment with a highly intelligent creature that will then procede to roam around and kill you off one by one. But, here, Mr. Tim Burton has given us something better.

It actually almost resembles the apartheid of the 1930s in a way, only it is in reverse. Instead of the whites in control of the blacks, it is the apes (black people) in control of the whites (but in this case, it would be all humans).The story is well-told and is actually more of another sequel than it is a remake, but either way, Tim Burton's visual gem will be a fun to stun people for generations to come.PLANET OF THE APES: 5/5.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

The acting is barely sufficient to carry the undemanding plot: all that was required was to update the 1968 original with the current state of the art: and I mean ART. The only good idea in the film is the casting of Charlton Heston, who starred in the original.The remake's finale is worrisome with its latent opening for a sequel: let's hope it never does come about -- but as the saying goes, monkey see, monkey do.If someone from the film industry actually reads these comments, I would love to hear an explanation of how a scene with four-handed apes outrunning four-hoofed horses makes it through the final editing.

Tim Roth was amazing, absolutely brilliant as the most evil looking ape i have ever seen. the guy deserves an award , should give him the most evil looking thing on screen award (lol).. wark walhberg does his best bless him but overacts a badly written script. helena bonham carter was fairly impressive as human lover ari but lacked a certain something.. and the ending,  oh my god, what an absolute pile of crap, i came out of the movie laughing at its sheer pathetic attempt at bringing an exciting twist, but people give me a break,  now the ending to the original was brilliant finding the statue of liberty but this was dire. as brilliant as tim burton is i am not attacking his vision in any way, but this is possibly the worst movie he has ever made. i was hugely disappointed by it and would say this, go and see it for the effects which at times can be quite scary, but i guarantee 2 things,  you will come out laughing and you will never want to see it again.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was a huge relief to discover that Burton's *Apes* -- easily the most entertaining film so far this summer -- is perhaps his most visually and dramatically gripping film ever.  This is despite Mark Wahlberg's woodenly resolute performance, which displays about as much screen charisma as an orangutan's hairbrush.  The apes, however, in their far more pliant makeup, steal the show. Paul Giamatti absolutely steals the film as the conniving human-trader ""Limbo,"" and Tim Roth's General Thade is robustly animalistic.  The apes' habit of leaping in the air in displays of anger owes something to Jane Goodall and something to Hong Kong action flicks -- but wherever it comes from, it adds an extra zest to the simian world. While it doesn't reach the darkly sublime heights of Batman or Edward Scissorhands, *Apes* is Burton's best in some time, and easily steals the show from the series of  stumbling (and expensive) zombies the studios have vomited forth so far this summer.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was also called Planet of the Apes.  Why they chose to take a perfectly good idea and change into a bad idea is beyond me.  This movie was designed to please thirteen year olds. Lots of monkeys jumping around and some cool special effects.  Those of us who have seen the original and know that it was an intellectually effective movie, should generally be disappointed with this sad re-make.  Don't get me wrong, the apes were cool looking and the special effects were decent.  In fact, take the monkeys of today and put them in the Charleton Heston film 34 years ago and you'd really have something.  I don't want to spoil the film for anyone so I won't, but what is the deal with the end?  Those of you who have seen it know what I'm talking about.  This is a perfect example of poor story telling, from completely undeveloped characters who suddenly play a somewhat surprisingly important role in the protagonists actions, to scenes which have even the most intelligent of critics at a loss (in reference to the end).I gave this movie 6 out of 10 because as I said, the monkeys are cool.  I love Tim Roth and they obviously spent a great deal of time teaching the actors to act as apes.  However, this is never enough to make up for a bad story (those apes evolved awfully fast).  See it if you wish, but if you wish to see an updated Charleton Heston picture, don't bother.  Just watch the original.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I remember awaiting each sequel as it arrived in theaters in the 70s.  Tim Burton's film comes as totally different take on POTA, and this time with mind-blowing makeup and outrageous action sequences.Movie-goers who cannot appreciate the joys of ""Planet of the Apes"" have become too mired down in investigating plot-points and errors in logic -- all of which could be explained away by any talented sci-fi writer.  Tim Burton (surely one of today's greatest film makers) isn't concerned with exposition and plot contrivances -- only in entertaining his audience like a great showman would.  And that he does in a big way with this epic-scale adventure, which hardly resembles the original 1968 movie in character or theme, so pre-conceptions best be left at the door.Burton's ""Planet of the Apes"" supplies more black comedy than the first, often jumping over-the-top in its ability to constantly amaze and amuse the viewer.  The scene of a ""mixed"" ape dinner party has to have the most outrageous and amazing makeup effects ever created.  Tim Roth as bad-to-the-bone chimpanzee General Thade is terrifying, evil and ugly and probably gives the best performance among excellent company.  Mark Wahlberg makes for a perfect leading man, understated in manners and voice as a contrast to the bizarre and outlandish apes.  And Paul Giamatti as Limbo (a stand-in for old orange Dr Zais?) gives one of the best comic performances ever seen.This is ""popcorn"" style cinema, and it really bends over backwards to amaze and amuse the viewer.  Credit must be given to Burton and his art department for the campy sets, costumes and obviously the convincing makeup jobs which trumped any similar ones ever on film.  Rick Baker (the great makeup up artist) has taken his art to a higher plane in this monumental effort, and really should be acknowledged for giving audiences such thrilling creatures to view.  They're like no others ever seen on the screen, and to watch the expressive faces of these apes is a remarkable experience in viewing. The faces appear so life-like that you begin to believe you're watching actual apes.Kids should love this outing, with the violence all being decidedly PG and usually occurring off-screen.  Parents can also sit back and enjoy the trip to this wild planet since its loaded with symbolism and cultural references all cleverly packaged in Hollywood's best style.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

Instead we have a disjointed collection of Burton trademarks - dark austere sets, amazing visual detail, slightly warped humor, all competing with tired block-buster themes of choreographed fighting sequences, large explosions and poor scripts.

The bonanza of great effects make for great entertainment but the lack of a visionary story make this a one-dimensional kid's movie which won't stick in the brain for adults. There is no ""discussion"" on the moral/philosphical place of man in the universe: in the original book/movie, our hero is clearly divided since he neither fits in with the future's primitive humans nor the apes. This version is just another uncompelling ""Us vs. Them,"" and the war-like gorillas sound and look like Klingons in ""Star Trek."" Speaking of gorillas, whom did they evolve from since there were originally only chimps? Where do they live, since there are too many for that hilltown? Where did the modern-speaking humans come from if the caucasian astronauts all died? Why does the blonde babe keep ducking out of scenes - does she have a bladder like a thimble? And are we on earth in the far future or far past? Or another dimension? This last plot problem ruins the great visual ending (try as it might to be like the book's end). The soundtrack also doesn't credit it's inspiration to the better original. For those who absurdly claim we need remakes because kids won't watch the originals, it was we kids who loved the original enough to generate 4 sequels, a live-action and animated TV series, lunch boxes, etc. and inspire Tim Burton.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

A fun flick.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Some movies are bad because of a bad plot. Some movies are bad by design, i.e. quickie, cheesy exploitation movies. And some movies are bad because a director goes hopelessly out of control... pounding home his vision with the force of a gorilla's fist in an iron glove. Joining the ranks of ""Water World"", ""The Wild, Wild West"" and ""Battlefield Earth"", ""Planet Of The  Apes"" comes yelping and screaming to the screen as a comic book come to life. The trouble is, it doesn't know what it is. A science fiction thriller? A horror story? A comedy? High Camp? Unintentionally funny. Stilted. Stupefying. Kris Kristofferson is left hung out to dry as a sort of latter-day Tumak from ""One Million Years B.C.;"" loincloth-clad Estella Warren appears baffled throughout and although a love interest, has surprisingly little to do . Various human characters are introduced only to later stand around and gawk. Some great ape makeup is wasted on some of the sorriest, most hapless ape villains in movie history. Apes snarl. They grunt. They scream and jump on a planet that seems to have the gravitational pull of our moon...one blow will send an ape or human flying 20 feet into the air on obviously ill-concealed wire harnesses. We have comic(?) relief in the form of a Gilbert Gottfried patterned ape slave trader who is one moment sadistically brutal, the next moment a wise-cracking borscht-belt comedian who may be the most annoying movie character this side of Jar-Jar Binks.  Hero Mark Wahlberg makes one yearn for a real hero in the mold of a Charlton Heston or a Harrison Ford...his heroics consist of simply unfastening a few poorly locked chains and walking free. Couple all this with a some outlandish spacecraft wreckage that functions perfectly after 3,000 years and an army of 10,000 apes that inflicts absolutely no damage to its enemies and you have a turkey that defies description. Tim Burton slips on a Kong-Sized banana peel. A  stupendous, colossal, preposterous yawn.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

He gives the moral a 180 and suddenly man is the utmost being and technology is his savior.  It just goes to show how self centered and over confident we have all become.For the record, even if there was no original Planet of the Apes, this would still be a worthless movie.

It is incredibly interesting how it is made. Now since I am only a thirteen year old boy I have not seen the original but the person I saw this with says that they are incredibly different and it is hard to compare this and the 1968 version. When I heard a few years ago that they are making a remake for Planet of the Apes  i didn't think that it was going to be very good and I already knew it would be very hard to make with just the apes and at the end there is over a couple hundred apes. They had put in an extrordinary amount just when they had put the names up at the beginning. Although it is a good movie it is also confusing at the end. I won't ruin it for you but be prepared to use your brain in the last few minutes.

Remake: 7/10.)Firstly, let me warn readers that this will be more of a rant than an even-minded critique; so if balance and objectivity are what you're searching for, you'd be better served by seeking out a positive review of the '68 version... I'm in the mood to make possibly unfair comparisons, and I'll make no attempt to hide that - so if you don't find yourself disgusted with me at this point, then read on...* I watched the original last night; Heston put a black mark on the film for me straight away. He has the sense of authority and presence only of a poor man's Clint Eastwood; and he looks like he would be better suited to working in Infomercials, with his manner of gazing earnestly into the camera and intoning gravely. OK, to be fair; Wahlberg is no better here, but it makes for a more believable crew and surroundings if the 'leading man' has gone AWOL and you don't have someone who carries his reputation before him constantly looking to unduly milk significance from the script. Wahlberg makes a better Everyman, so you see him more 'in character' than when you watch Heston, who typifies a Hollywood landmark.* You don't think of Kubrick and his Odyssey, when you watch this update. The sinister overlords are revealed much more stealthily. Unfortunately, Stanley cornered the market for 'primate roaming barren landscape' imagery just a few months after Schaffner's work opened, and there's no doubt which is the more memorable image in these modern years. Such is life. Burton doesn't even try to approach from such an angle, and it works. I suppose that's one reason I can get aboard the 're-imagination' train, because at least we get a newer look...* There's less 'blithe imperialism' tossed about in our politically correct days. ""Give it a few weeks and you could own this place"", someone mentions to Heston on our first trip. OK, now I as the audience think you DESERVE to be subjugated for your arrogance! All our modern young explorers want to do is repair their mistakes, though; so yep, they're the winners of my sympathy vote. Chalk up another 'moral victory'...* A bigger budget and more 'experimental' supporting cast may mean we get better makeup; but what's much more crucial is the improved interpretation of speech. No more do we have to put up with creatures who intimidate and horrify us with their appearance, but nevertheless all have voices that remind us uncannily of the nearest fishmonger from down the high street. Happily, this time our villains manage to sound unfamiliar and scary, to boot!* The forefather possibly started a flagellation fetish for those would be conquerors of brave new frontiers, further exploited by ""A Man Called Horse"", amongst others... Luckily, Burton opted for uneasy laughs instead; hanging our human friends in cages as an in-joke. It would thankfully be another few years before ""The Passion of The Christ"" caused some squirming in seats and revived masochism as the cinematic trend of the age...If you ask me; it looks like the passage of time does favours for ALL civilisations... !","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The metaphoric value of the book/original film are lost by the fact that humans here can already speak - english as usual -so the only superiority the apes have is physical. In fact, since all the humans were killed on the space station, who were all those long-haired Harley Biker dudes (the ""humans"") descended from?  Without the constant philosophical criticism of man's evil nature(throw in guilt and original sin too, what the heck), it turns into Humans versus hairy Roman empire-Mafiosa-Nazi-etc.-type aliens (Tim Roth is a composite of many movie evil archetypes). It looks like they borrowed the plot twists and F/X from the new ""Lost in Space"" movie, but that movie didn't really have to compete with the original series. The ending is reminiscent of the book BUT doesn't make sense in terms of time travel in our universe, so if he went back in time in an alternate universe, all quantum universes being equal, then it's just a coincidence he returns to an ape-ruled earth (rather than an INEVITABILITY which was THE POINT in the book/original film). To put it another way, if Burton's movie came first, noone would be inspired to remake it 30 years. Great effects, costumes and menacing apes but very uninspiring.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I enjoyed the effects, I enjoyed Elfman's score, the makeup was wonderful, the acting of all the ape characters was pretty terrific, the plot was at least interesting.  Those are all good things, and made it an endurable experience, not like, say, Nightfall.So what was wrong?  One factor.

The part wasn't written terribly interesting (but think Sean Connery, John Wayne, Jimmy Stewart - a talented actor can *make* a part interesting).  Doing a lot of standing around and staring, occasionally broken up by some moving around and staring, won't breathe life into a part.And when he did do something or speak, I found his character unsympathetic and centerless.Now, I didn't think much about the original while watching, because I think such comparisons are unfair and usually irrelevant.

Why not treat it as such?  Instead, we have Mark Wahlberg who seems to have a permanent scowl etched into his face.  Where is the wisecracking Arnold when you need him?  Tim Roth is no better.  While his mannerisms and swagger are excellent, his over-the-top anger makes his General Thade into nothing more than an enraged chimp throwing feces at everyone in the film (and the audience).  Somebody please call the animal control unit!  Planet of the Apes is SO cold, SO angry, and SO dark that I finally became bored with the whole thing.  Burton, however, is clever.  In an effort to generate repeat business, he tacked on an ending that is so baffling, audiences will be lined up a second and third time just to try to make sense of it.  Lacking the clarity to be shocking, it is simply an inexplicable, absurd anomaly.

I had been expecting it since the early 90's! From reading the reviews, however, I get the feeling that it was probably only me who made that prediction. Why did I predict or even insisted that there would be a re-make of Planet Of The Apes?  Well, for one thing, I believed that the advanced cinema techniques could add so much flavour to the original screenplay, which was superbly revolutionary (please read my review for the original Planet Of The Apes 68' to see why I consider the original screenplay to be ""revolutionary""). I have always thought that the original Planet Of The Apes was full of imaginative thoughts but it lacked juicy action scenes that could have made it even more fun to watch (however even this drawback didn't stop it from becoming a classic sci-fi, probably the best of its genre). The other reason why I expected a re-make was because I wanted to see my most favourite sci-fi saga being re-imagined, as director Tim Burton put it. My Vote: 7/10Things I liked about the movie: In contrast to other people, I liked the screenplay. In fact, I thought that it was brilliant. It was probably the best screenplay that could have been written for this movie without the ""it-was-earth-all-along"" concept that shocks the audience in the 68' version. I was as much amused by the twists in the end, as I was amused when I watched the original 68' version. Even the last 4-5 minutes were such a great enjoyment. I honestly think the screenplay works. But as much as it works, screenplay was not the best thing about the movie. I personally think that there are mainly two things about this movie that left me in complete amazement, 1) Tim Roth's performance and 2) The original score of the movie, both of which well deserve Oscar Nomination. Tim Roth was the only REAL APE in the movie; the rest were just humans under ape costumes. Tim Roth was the only one who really gave his character an identity. He was not just an ape; he was an ape with a personality. The rest of the cast couldn't even manage to act or even look like apes, except for their costumes, of course. The original score was totally mind-blowing. It is a musical expression of what's going on in the movie. Marvellous achievement!Things I didn't like about the movie: In contrast what other people think, I thought that the apes were too human. They were humans under ape costumes. Most of them didn't even try to act or move like an ape (except for Tim Roth). Obviously, they thought that wearing an ape costume was enough. I could puke at the dinner scene when the elderly ape character was speaking: he was just TOO HUMAN. And again, in contrast what other people think, I wasn't satisfied with the make up. Well, for one thing, the cast put too much trust in their make-ups; they didn't make the slightest effort to give themselves an ape-like personality (a couple of scenes showing them hanging upside down from the ceilings or trees don't redeem that - if they are ape enough to do that then how come they are so much human when talking?). Secondly, the make up in the original version was as good as it could get; it was revolutionary in its time. That's why, there was nothing revolutionary about the make ups in this one. Briefly, it was not better than the make ups in the original 68' version. Lastly, I saw a couple of flaws in the make up. For one thing, the one ape character -the one who sells humans as gifts- hadn't had his eyelids painted; every time he closed his eyes, his eyelids would look white (am I the only one who saw that?). Some of the actors' upper teeth had ape-like appearance, whereas their lower level teeth were obviously human-like. What about the hair of Ari (Helena Bonham Carter)? It looked like she had hair done in a beauty salon; it was too human. And her make up was terribly cheap, as if she was a little girl who didn't know how to put a make up. Maybe, Tim Burton wanted to give story a different respective with these ideas on purpose. But honestly, I don't think they work. My last criticism is the inappropriate sense of humour, which has become the disease of Hollywood in recent years. Directors must be very careful about the timing and the nature of the humour otherwise they spoil the whole movie. There are some silly jokes that work perfectly fine in the genre of comedy (Rush Hour, American Pie, Jim Carrey / Eddie Murphy kind of comedies and the like). But when you use jokes out of these movies in a movie that has a totally different personality, it spoils it. Within that respect, I have found the scene where the elderly ape character is taking his fake teeth out and putting into a jar absolutely inappropriate. Other then these flaws, the movie was a perfect re-make of an old sci-fi classic. Possible Academy Awards Nominations: 1) Best Performance By A Leading Actor In A Motion Picture: Tim Roth. 2) The Original Score: Danny Alfman","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

If nothing else, Tim Burton's new APES carries the torch in this respect- even though I knew what was coming, the gorillas, orangutans and assorted other talking simians repeatedly raised the hair on my own neck, especially Tim Roth's incredibly athletic and menacing Thade.  On top of that, Burton manages to throw in quite a bit of humor, including some goofball nods to the original APES. The sets of course are magnificent, and so are the makeup and effects.  The SciFi sensibility of this version, however, is lacking (especially compared to how far ahead of its time the original was).  The beginning of the film has a rushed feel to it, and there are some plot holes regarding space travel and basic physics that will turn off many hardline SciFi fans.  All in all, though, summer audiences don't ask too much of their summer blockbusters, and this one delivers on that count.  Never a dull moment, lots to look at, and the simians in this version are a LOT more ape-like. The acting achievements of Roth and Bonham-Carter are amazing, and steal a lot of thunder from the human co-stars, including Wahlberg (who unfortunately for his female audience never appears bare-chested... sorry girls).  7 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It went on to spawn a number of weaker sequels and a short-lived TV show with ever decreasing results.Having said that, any of them have to be better than this luke-warm effort from Tim Burton. The studio was clear that this was not a sequel or remaking of the first film, it was a 're-imagination' - but it is quite clear that imagination is one thing missing from this movie.As with almost all big studio movies in 2001, the plot has been released back into the wild and is noticeable by its absence. To make up for this oversight the movie lurches from set-piece to set-piece throwing off any semblance of thought and coherence. Rather than have a plot, the movie sets up all sorts of gimmicks to get the heroes out of difficult situations. Mark Wahlberg has a gun in his survival kit, uses it to scare off some hostile apes. But two minutes later the gun is destroyed - oh no, what will they do now? No problems, right at the end of the movie ANOTHER gun is introduced from thin air to help out the heroes. Why not just keep the first one, or not have a gun at all?Instead of having the heroes, (or heaven forbid), the audience think, the movie always plays dumb. The climax is set in a ruined space ship that has been sitting in the desert for thousands of years. This ship (a hugely impressive set) has rusted through almost entirely, collapsed in places and is filled with sand. Yet little tiny switches work first time, convenient doors open and close with satisfying swooshing noises and there are video clips to explain the plot to the hard of thinking. There is simply no magic to the film, no satisfaction in working it out for yourself.And when its not playing dumb, it has gaps in the logic that make you go 'eh'? For instance, if the apes and the humans are both only on this deserted planet because of a crashed space ship, where did the horses come from?Is there anything worth seeing? Yes, Tim Roth's performance *IS* excellent, he does convince you that he is playing an ape and has a fine time chewing the scenery in the finest pantomime tradition. This is helped by some truly astonishing prosthetics used on his face. The rest of the ape designs are less successful, particularly Helena Bonham Carter's mask which is so thick and expressionless that she looks like a Muppet and forces her to talk with an irritating lisp.But if there is one thing that sums up all that is wrong with the film it is Estella Warren - beautiful, blond and completely and utterly pointless. Long lingering shots are devoted to her pouting and flicking her hair, but she does nothing else. Perhaps it's my age I couldn't help but think of Raquel Welch in 'One Million Years BC', but at least she had the decency to be chased by a dinosaur, Ms. Warren just stands in the background like a sulky teenager appealing to the teenage demographic. Perhaps I'm being too hard on her, because she does provide a tiny glimpse of hope for humanity. Apes may well be ascendant, mankind is reduced to savagery and the whole edifice of Western civilisation has come tumbling down but thanks to Estella Warren we know there is a bright future for orthodontistry, a girl can be sure of a fabulous leg wax and there is no shortage of non-smear lip gloss. A planet run by apes doesn't sound quite so bad now does it?","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's an excellent movie, which didn't need a remake, if not to make it more appealing to a new generation of film-lovers. Tim Burton's ""reimagining"" of the movie was interesting on paper, no doubt about that, but it's also the most disappointing film he's done so far.Burton already did sci-fi in 1996, directing the hilarious Mars Attacks!. Now, that movie may have looked like his most un-Burton-like project, but it worked, thanks to the witty script, which perfectly reflected the director's freaky sense of humor, and the terrific cast (Nicholson, DeVito, Natalie Portman, Pierce Brosnan et al). Planet of the Apes, on the other hand, contains the quintessential burtonian theme (outcasts feared by other people), and it's really, really dark compared to the original, but its strength is all in the style: from Rick Baker's utterly realistic make-up to Danny Elfman's ""simian"" score, the movie is perfect, technically speaking. It's the storytelling and acting that aren't always as good as expected.The screenplay, while repeating the same basic idea - human astronaut ends up on another world where intelligent apes have enslaved mankind -, is supposedly more faithful to Pierre Boulle's novel, especially the ending (I won't spoil it, but it's far less shocking than what Charlton Heston saw back in 1968), although it suffers from one detail: much of the original version's charm had to do, among other things, with the fact that humans didn't talk on the Planet, making Heston's presence more intriguing. In Burton's movie, they can talk, which leads to an obvious question: why did no none try to have a reasonable conversation with the apes? Sure, that would have killed the movie right away, but it just feels pointless to introduce this new aspect and not develop it.The other weak element is the acting, particularly the ""humans"": Mark Wahlberg has none of the charisma he had in Boogie Nights, and his co-stars (Kris Kristofferson, Estella Warren) don't impress that much either. It's the monkeys that deserve our attention, most notably Helena Bonham Carter as the human-loving scientist and Tim Roth as evil general Thade (a treat for fans: Charlton Heston plays Roth's daddy). They bring intensity to their characters and Carter in particular succeeds in bringing new life to one of the most loved primates from Franklin J. Schaffner's classic.Overall not a very bad film, but we expected more from the man who gave us the ""new"" versions of Batman and Ichabod Crane. Too much studio interference, perhaps?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But because Tim Burton was my favorite film director and I thought it was only okay But watching it again, I'm one of the the few --probably on the planet--who really likes this First of all you really need to accept this film is not a remake, and I like the story more.Many criticize the direction, and I've found as an older person, I really liked it much more than when I was younger. In fact I was twelve when I saw it in the cinema -- the violence disturbed me, but I love the ending. I still love the ending Not enough films (or at least big films) have a finale like this, in fact that was one of the criticisms on Minority Report (which I need to watch again) But my favorite director of all time has made a film people consider his biggest fault, they don't like Alice in Wonderland either I love both, I love all his films.I'm proud I have the DVD, and don't need other people to like it as much to make me feel like I'm allowed to feel that way Oh and the cast and acting are wonderful, so is the make-up.

Sure, visually, this movie is plenty slick and the make-up and costumes are artistry. Too bad that's simply not enough to hold the interest of most ten year olds, let alone adults. The lack of plot and character development really shocked me for a Burton film. I'm left to again wonder if Hollywood really thinks we are all that stupid? From the completely impossible story line and ridiculous scenes, to the humans glossy lips in the desert, I felt like a victim of a very bad joke. Even my eight year old began asking ""how much longer is this movie?"" a short 30 minutes into it.

Being a big fan of the original POA film & TV series (& cartoons), I was looking forward to this film, though with some apprehension. I kind of enjoyed the parallels to the originals: ""Get your stinking paws off me, you damn, dirty human!"" My favorite was C. Heston: ""Damn them...Damn them all to Hell!"" and of course, he had a gun in his room.While watching this film, I had a problem with almost everything. From the gigantic halls of the space craft to the pathetic sound stage of Ape City. Don't you think that by the 22nd century, people who work with primates would figure out the difference between apes & monkeys? How many USAF captains would disobey a direct order from a 4-star general by flying out into danger? Probably half of the ape actors really walked correctly (as an ape's pelvis would allow). It sure was great that the spaceship worked after so many thousand years. Boy, they don't make 'em like that anymore. At least the apes bungee jumping around didn't look as pathetic as Crouching Tiger.I still can't tell if this was supposed to be a serious sci-fi drama or a spoof on the original. I guess I should have guessed what was in store when I saw in the opening credits ""Based on A novel by Pierre Boule"" and not ""Based on THE novel by Pierre Boule.""On the plus side, Helena Carter was excellent, the ape costumes were fantastic and the cinematography was very good. However, they didn't save the movie or the world. Avoid this film unless you are a hopeless Apes fan...like me.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There is no tension, no suspense, the relationships are empty and not worked out and even the main theme (where do the apes come from and how did they get in charge?) is hardly worked out at all. In short, I wonder why this movie has been made at all. There was an older -better- one already. Why had this one been added? Of course, special effects are better now, but that is no reason for a new version. The makers did not use the challenge to give the movie the tension and suspense it really needs. They did add some -misplaced- humor, which really almost makes the film a kind of cartoon.Where is the time when SF films were full of suspense? ""Alien"" is an example, although that one has a bit too much of suspense. But was Tim Burton not able to make something better of it? In that case he should restrict himself to animated movies, like ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", which was brilliant.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Like I did....... I thought that the special F/X were great, the costumes were pretty well designed, and the scenery was very enticing to the eye and mind.

It may be good on DVD with surround sound speakers on a big TV, but if you don't have that, go see this while still at the theaters.  I think that the graphics and visuals will be lost on small screen.  I gave it 7 out of 10 - just for shear entertainment of the flick, not anything more than that.....

When the five original Apes movies were remastered and re-released on DVD, I spent a week rewatching them. Not only were the films pleasing on an aesthetic level, but I was better able to appreciate the complex political subtext that had been inserted by Rod Serling and later screenwriters. These are angry, intelligent films, which in many ways, despite diminishing budgets, get better as the series progresses. The revolutionary implications of the fourth film, Conquest (its climax was modeled after the Watts riots), were so extreme that the studio forced a re-shoot of the ending, which originally had Caesar (played with amazing Shakespearean grandeur by Roddy McDowell) leading a final slaughter of the hopelessly debased human population.How can a film over two hours long contain so little? There is not one good line, there is not one good SHOT in the entire remake. Given Tim Burton's track record, I expected at the very least a memorable visual experience. Instead we get a dim bluish murk, clunky editing, and shoddy, oppressive studio-bound sets. The oh-so-clever 'relevant' dialog wouldn't pass muster on a lackluster episode of Politically Incorrect, and the 'shock' ending is just completely incomprehensible. Also, why did they make Helena Bonham Carter's ape character look like Michael Jackson?In 1968, Chuck Heston, as the misanthropic astronaut Taylor, ran around in a loin cloth, bared his ass, and roared bitter imprecations in his great, gravely voice. Now Mark Walberg (the new Cary Grant, according to Vanity Fair - go figure) keeps his bulky, restrictive space suit on for the entire film, and DOES NOT EVEN BOTHER TO ACT. His voice never rises above a whisper. His facial expression never changes. Well, that routine only works when you have charisma to spare. Had I been casting this film, it would have been Bruce Willis all the way. He would have known how to empathize with an ape.How sad that the three-dimensional characters of the original series have been reduced to platitudinous stereotypes; or that the story is now nothing more than 'heroic astronaut liberates oppressed humans from evil monkeys'; or that, had I not read the reviews ahead of time, I would not have known who played the apes (in the old days they put distinctive voices under the make-up: McDowell, Kim hunter, Paul Williams, John Huston). THIS IS WHY I DO NOT WANT TO GO TO THE MOVIES ANYMORE! This is why I would rather stay at home and watch Kurosawa on DVD.Thank God Roddy did not live to see this.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

But an abrupt detour through a space time wormhole lands him on a strange planet where talking apes rule over the human race. With the help of a sympathetic chimpanzee activist named Ari and a small band of human rebels, Leo leads the effort to evade the advancing Gorilla Army led by General Thade and his most trusted warrior Attar. Now the race is on to reach a sacred temple within the planet's Forbidden Zone to discover the shocking secrets of mankind's past - and the key to its future.I was really looking forward to this film and finally, I've seen it. It was a good movie, but the ending ruined it. Let's start at the beginning. The score was appropriately themed with the movie. It was wonderfully cast by great actors and actresses. The action and story was good.Well, what's wrong with the ending? It's one of the most pathetic excuses to leave open a sequel (AKA: The cliffhanger). Ugh, if only that would be different, I would recommend this good picture. The one liners were cheesy but I didn't mind it. The makeup effects were excellent (you couldn't tell which actors/actresses were which). Some CGI shots were also pretty good.I like Tim Burton's look on the whole world is great. The plot was surprisingly complicated (not like a mind puzzle, though). Mark Whelberg plays one handsome protagonist. Tim Roth plays a surprisingly creepy and angry antagonist and Helena Bonham Carter's performance was really sympathetic. And last but not least, Paul Giamatti gives a great comedic role.I'll say it again: The ending ruined the film. I hated it. Still, if you want to watch an entertaining movie with some great action and story, go ahead and watch it but be aware of the ending.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But I have decided the majority of the blame should sit on the shoulders of the writers, who obviously just punched the clock and saved their best stuff for something else.  It is impossible to build a good movie without a good script.
I'm sick of seeing movies like this one, that cash in on a big opening weekend before word of mouth can get out that it stinks.

"7","/10","Not As Good As The Original, But Still Reasonably Entertaining","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512181/?ref_=tt_urv","MadReviewer","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1125206/?ref_=tt_urv","6 August 2001","Tim Burton's ""Planet of the Apes"" is not a remake of the original version of the film, but rather a ""re-imagining"" or different take of that original material.  Wise move.  The original ""Apes"" is a film that still holds its own as an all-time sci-fi classic; pretty much any attempt to remake it faithfully would wind up like Gus Van Sant's remake of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". . . a pale imitation of greatness.  By ""reimagining"" the original film, Burton gives himself the opportunity to start with the established mythology of the ""Apes"" series, as well as the ability to travel in a new direction with that mythology.  The end result?  The new ""Planet of the Apes"" is nothing Earth-shattering (pardon the pun) -- in ten or twenty years, it won't be looked at with the same reverence or respect as the original ""Apes"" -- but it's still good, and brings enough new ideas to the table to make a reasonably entertaining film.The story, which ranges in spots from good to barely mediocre, possesses some serious gaps of logic and suffers from an awkward opening.  The first fifteen minutes of the film makes little sense, and lurches along aimlessly for awhile until it stumbles into the heart of its story.  (Examples of some nonsense: Couldn't chimp-piloted ships simply be controlled by computers? Would highly experimental exploration pods be able to launch from a space station just by one rogue pilot punching in a two-second launch sequence?) The opening of the film admittedly does make more sense by the end of the film, but it's still not very good.  It appears as though the writers thought of a solid middle and ending for their version of ""Planet of the Apes"" . . . but had no idea how to get the story past the opening credits to that middle and ending.  The weak beginning seems like their best attempt to get the story moving to those points.  As for the rest of the story, it contains a lot of good, even original elements, but some points are glossed over in a rather hurried fashion -- there's little effort made to explore some plot threads, and some of the explanations as to how and why things happen in the film are either weak or come completely out of left field. The story's excellent  . . . for a second draft.  I've read that Twentieth Century Fox rushed this new version of ""Planet of the Apes"" into production. Too bad.  The story and script could've been excellent -- and more important, solid throughout  -- with some more work.Despite the uneven story, though, director Tim Burton does a nice job, given the script he has to work with.  If nothing else, Burton has a knack for giving films an eccentric look, and his version of ""Planet of the Apes"" benefits greatly from his eccentric touch.  He evokes a lot of the weird imagery of the original films (the weird scarecrows, the desolate landscapes) without ever blatantly stealing from them.  He also does a great job when it comes to focusing on the smaller, quieter moments in the movie -- for example, there's a macabre scene where a child ape puts her pet human in its cage for the night that manages to be disturbing and funny at the same time.  Burton, though, doesn't appear to have a clear idea of the overall tone of the movie.  In ""Planet of the Apes"", he goes for a blend of action, comedy, and seriousness . . . but the blend doesn't always work. Some of the humor seems out of place, and the action often seems stilted, as if Burton didn't know what to do with the apes apart from having them leap around menacingly.  The film is one of Burton's better efforts, but much like the script, the direction contains a few distinct weak spots.
As for the actors . . . again, it's a mixed bag.  The apes comprise the stronger half of the cast, which makes sense, since the apes are the weirder of the two groups - and Tim Burton specializes in weird.  In regards to the human characters, Burton would've been better off making the humans in his version of ""Planet of the Apes"" more like the humans in the original film - mute.  Apart from the protagonist Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg), none of them add anything of import to the film anyway. The highlights of the individual actors come from mostly from the main characters.  Tim Roth nails the part of villainous General Thade perfectly - he's one of the best sci-fi screen villains to appear on screen in quite awhile. Wahlberg plays Captain Leo Davidson in a manner similar to Heston in the original film; he's a man who's not terribly interested in contemplating how he arrived at a planet ruled by intelligent apes . . . he just knows he wants to leave.  Fast. He's a pragmatic hero, one who reluctantly tries to help others in distress, but doesn't want to die in the process.  Also worth mentioning is Paul Giamatti, who provides some much-needed comic relief as the peculiar orangutan slaver Limbo.  On the other side of the acting coin, the biggest disappointment came from Helena Bonham Carter as Ari.  Given the poor quality of her character in the screenplay, she does what she can for her character, but all she really does for the whole film is to go around being nice to humans.  Period.  Some reasons as to WHY Ari feels so passionately about helping humans would've been nice.Tim Burton's `Planet of the Apes' is an action movie that manages to take some of the influences of the original `Apes' films, and then creates something eccentric and new.  Does it always work?  No, although in general, the good outweighs the bad.  Is it better than the original?  Absolutely not.  In a summer filled with blockbuster duds, though, there's something to be said for a film that provides some thrills and some fun, and the new `Planet of Apes' does exactly that.  Overall, it's an enjoyable film; it's just not a spectacular one.  Grade: B","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, at least that made you stop and re-evaluate all that had gone before in the film. In the new version, you just think WHAT??? HOW DID THAT HAPPEN??When are some film producers going to realise that what excites and enthuses moviegoers is not a twist ending as such, but a twist ending that is a shock BUT ALSO makes sense in the context of the film.

Last week I saw Sleepy Hollow for the 5th time, so I hoped (and expected) for some more Burton-magic. When I left for home I had seen almost none of that.First the story. The script had to many flaws. During the whole movie the story stays mainly too shallow, for instance the character of Leo is always two-dimensional. I also missed some big-scenes. Their were just a few moments in the movie that 'resparked'the movie. Also Burton could have done better, for instance the big fight-scene could have been a lot better. Also disappointing was the scenery, it looked like a set all the way. The acting was mainly poor, Wahlberg en Bonham-Carter can be good actors, but this time he couldn't convince me. Warren was a big laugh. The exception was of course Tim Roth. Maybe sometimes over the top, but in general great.

The film itself was a dud, and got a ruthless beating from critics and the general public, despite making a profit in theaters.The problem is that they tried to ""re-imagine"" the original much in the same way that ""Batman Begins"" was a restart of the Batman franchise - but ""Begins"" did it well, and ""Planet of the Apes"" was not as skillful.Tim Burton has some die-hard cult fans on this site who are quick to blame studio interference, but I think the real problem is that Burton was given too much free roam. Armed with a $100,000,000 budget and a very mainstream, action-oriented picture - something he had only ever ventured upon with ""Batman"" more than a decade prior - he just couldn't get a grip on any aspect of the feature. It's a very loose, jumbled, unfocused picture - full of absurdity, stupidity and downright hammy acting.Mark Wahlberg plays the hero, an astronaut who is transported through a black hole to another galaxy where apes rule the world and humans are their slaves. Leading a revolt against the apes, he fights for the rights of humanity - becoming a Jesus Christ figure for all the other humans...a ""savior."" The ending throws in an illogical and pointless twist that is just there for the sake of shocking people. It undermines the rest of the film and makes you kind of go, ""So what was the point of everything that happened before this?""

There is a humour and darkness to the film that can only be provided by Tim Burton as well as his trade mark scarecrows. But as with all good things, what was right about this film came to a crashing end and that comes at the end.

This Planet of the Apes reboot brings little to nothing new to the series with a brutally dull outcome.Look, it's easier said than done. Remakes and reboots have a lot of pressure and usually wind up being a waste of time. But there was serious potential here. With Tim Burton coming off a few solid films with Johnny Depp and box office success with Batman, you'd think he would have a grapple on what to do with the Apes franchise. Sadly, it was the exact opposite.The original 1968 classic was thought provoking and lead to a couple really well done sequels, but Burton's take is disappointingly more creepy and awkward than it is cerebral. I'm sorry, but I just don't care for seeing Mark Wahlberg have a strange romantic relationship with a female ape. Or, rather, an equally dull relationship with a human, played by Estella Warren. No chemistry between the two, whatsoever.But there are a few redeemable qualities surprisingly. Instead of a massive Statue of Liberty reveal at the end, Burton makes a few middle act changes that actually benefit the story in the long run. Having the very cause of the apes taking over earth being due to Wahlberg's mistake was interesting, but I'm just not sure it was earned. Something else that wasn't earned is the entire third act. Talk about an atrocious piece of mess, the third act tries to propose so many ideas and take twists and turns that it just all feels tiresome. Unfortunately, by the time the big battle comes around, you just don't care.It's easy to look at a film in hindsight and say it shouldn't have been made, but seriously, this Apes entry should not have been made. It wasn't yet the time where visual effects offered up the opportunity to do great motion capture or picture perfect-looking Apes (Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, 2014) and using old make-up was the wrong choice. It's nice for the 60's but using it in 2001 is a completely different entity. But the main problem is that the characters and story are second to an attempt to build out impressive set pieces. Tim Roth's one-note villain and the film's choice for romances make for one brutal viewing.+Some interesting subtle changes-Lack of reinvention-Awkward romances-No reason for 2001 to be the time for a remake4.6/10","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Although I enjoyed the newer version, there are some small disappointments to mention: Minor changes to plot seem to make this movie less mysterious and dramatic.The main character, again an astronaut, doesn't come out of deep hibernation this time. Heroic enough, in an attempt to rescue a monkey during an experiment, he himself loses contact with the space station too.When he - the astronaut named Leo Davidson - is stranded alone on a planet the dialog shifts to the inhabitants. It's a pity he is able to communicate with both apes and humans. In the older version the humans talked apey.Nonetheless, the art direction of this movie is very impressive. The costumes look superb. I question however why there are various ape species chosen. It takes away some of the realism, although it is supposed to be fiction from the start.Due to the dark sounds used, this movie is still somewhat of a thrill. There may be lesser drama, but it contains a load of beautifully captured action. Tim Burton, the director, did a good job, as well as the art direction.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But we can imagine what director Burton's penchant for nightmarish landscapes and dark fairy tales would look like if imposed on the well-known Planet of the Apes storyline. With such preconceptions, it's not at all a surprise what this film ended up becoming - in fact, it's fairly predictable, perhaps its biggest weakness. It's no surprise that many of those crowd shots of soldier apes here resemble the scary monkey-things from ""The Wizard of Oz."" Ironically, the first drawback for this version is its faithful adherence to the novel; the hero astronaut (Marky Mark) in this one really does travel to another planet, where the inhabitants (ruling apes & underdog humans) speak perfect English. The explanation for this bizarro planet and its presumed natives in the final third is not nearly as elegant as the logical one in the classic '68 film. We're asked to go along with the fanciful concepts and not think it out very much - this is fairy tale madness, after all, dressed up as science fiction for the masses. Burton seems to be in conflict with himself here - at once the eclectic stylist at odds with presenting a standard summer popcorn flic for the consumers.Where Burton and some of his actors do succeed is in presenting most of the new ape characters. Roth pretty much steals the movie from everyone as the central villain, Thade. Interestingly, this film was more accurate than the original in that it understood that chimpanzees are the most violence-prone and bad-tempered of the apes in our reality (gorillas are actually more benign). Thade, a super-chimp for lack of a better term, is possessed of power on several levels (physical, social, political) and uses it in displays of ferocious antipathy. Roth so loses himself in the role that, even as I viewed this a 2nd and 3rd time, knowing who it was under that ape make-up, I still could find no traces of him. It's a triumph of make-up FX and stellar method acting. All the actors who play apes in this picture, including Bonham Carter and Clarke Duncan, succeed in dazzling the audience to such a degree that, unfortunately, all the ones playing humans, including the main lead, come off as very bland. The climactic battle between the two armies is exciting and we tense up some more as Thade's villainy appears to near an end. Then everything becomes abruptly copacetic on this weird world and the final (secondary) climax back on Earth still doesn't make sense to me, not after the 3rd time, and probably not when I see it a 4th time. I think Burton's just messing with us.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This film is Tim Burton's ultimate disaster, an abomination of a re-imagining that should never have been made. Burton hasn't got a clue as to what made the original Apes Franchise so appealing and timeless to its legion of loyal supporters. I know that as a lifelong fan I had waited nearly thirty years for Twentieth Century Fox to green light another Apes project, and my hopes were high because I had liked Burton's dark and dreary BATMAN. But - as some behind the scenes footage would prove - Tim just thought of this whole undertaking as a goof and a joke, as he would break out into laughter after yelling ""Cut!"" while trying to maintain a straight face. Indeed, there is an over-use of comedy a-plenty in APES 2001, which appears to take precedence over everything else compelling, and it just made me sick. There are some gag-worthy perfunctory elements from the original 1968 classic tossed in which come off as an obligatory bone to throw fans: idiotic turns of iconic phrases, such as ""Take your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty Human!!"", and even a non-credited (thank God) cameo by Charlton Heston himself in ape makeup as he parodies his own persona with a mighty ""Damn Them All To HELL!!"" yell. The human characters in this version can speak but are completely undeveloped; even Linda Harrison's mute 'Nova' in the first two original APES movies had managed to make her someone we could relate to and care for! Oh, and I forgot about Marky Mark Wahlberg in the part of the lead astronaut who lands on this dopey planet ... the less said about him here, the better.Many people are completely confused by the ending of Burton's picture (so was Burton, if you hear him stammering and trying to make sense of it himself on the DVD commentary). I get it all right myself, but it was just badly realized. Within the whole movie you get the feeling that there is no story attempt, or that maybe a lot of things were edited and then just haphazardly reconstructed. But the main insult is that the core idea behind Planet of the Apes is not supposed to be about laughing at a bunch of silly monkeys in clothes bouncing all over the walls and shrieking and hollering. That misses the entire point of the message behind the series. However, as vomit-able and insulting as Burton's pile of gorilla manure may be, there are a merciful few things which prevent it from being totally unwatchable: For starters, Tim Roth makes a delicious villain as the evil chimpanzee Thade. Paul Giamatti's comical orangutan character Limbo is spirited, but overstays his welcome and would have been tolerable only in very small doses. I must respect Rick Baker's new apes makeups to some extent, even though I don't think they can best John Chamber's original 1960's designs. Whatever compliments I'd give to the makeups are only with respect to the male apes; the females are very badly realized... Helena Bonham Carter's female chimpanzee here is just terrible ... she looks more like Paula Abdul rather than an ape. Fox would fare better with its second stab at a reboot ten years later. But Tim Burton really dropped the ball for this instantly forgettable travesty.

It had potential, Tim Burton is one of the greatest directors of modern cinema and what does he do? Totally unoriginal version of the POTA. There's nothing in this film, that gives out impression, that it has been made by one of the greatest and visual directors of today. And that was the main reason for me to give only 6/10.AS a movie I actually do find this better than the original POTA, tough the original had more depth in the script, I've always disliked it because of the horrible soundtrack they used on it. I always did find it very difficult to watch the movie because of that. This Tim Burton's version is far more easier for the ears and basically the plot tries to handle same issues with the original. But the problem remains: This was not Tim Burton movie. I don't know what possessed him. He just blurted out this uninspired thing and went on doing something he does best: Tim Burton movies.I wouldn't recommend this for Tim Burton fans. And I don't know will fans of original like this either. But if you are new on the whole subject, then maybe.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

IMO, Wahlberg is a crappy actor and must've slept with producers to get into the movies.

It's supposed to be about the substance of a thought provoking story. It was more like watching Stargate than POTA. Cheesy. Over egged at every turn and nothing like the classic original. I know they created some car crashes in the original 4 sequels but it was the early 70's. This had all the resources of the 21st century, yet it concentrated on the set design more than making the story any good. Humans should have been mute. Bar Leo. I'd have preferred an atmospheric dystopia with very little dialogue over the hammed up, obvious man vs beast rubbish we are exposed too. Giamatti's character was like a star wars droid merchant. Supposed to be funny. But was out of place and sort of ridiculed the lore of the saga by just existing. Also the not so subtle sexual attraction between Bonham Carter and Whalberg was just plain weird. These elements twinned with a plethora of awful acting from a normally decent group make for a pretty dire affair. Also the much maligned ending just caps it off. It just makes no sense no matter what timeline your in. A sad and unfortunate blot on the cinematic landscape. At least it warned future producers not to let Burton crap all over any other sacred Sci fi. 3 is the most I can muster. Worst Movie in the entire catalogue.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I would have thought that if one were to remake a film, it would at least improve upon it's major flaw. I know little of ape behaviour, however, I did appreciate their efforts in adding ape gestures (i.e. rubbing knuckles on another's chest). It took me twelve years to finally see this movie.

It was sort of a remake but then again, not really. I was very disappointed considering the tools that Tim Burton has at his disposal. He had great make up and CGI available and lots of money ($100 million) but can you honestly say that what we got was as good as the original film that was made for less than $6 million? Heck no. So in that regard, the film fails.At least in the original film, the statue of liberty scene was shocking but there was nothing shocking in this film even the end scene because you could kind of see it coming. And, by the way, if you give it some thought, and I did, you can figure out how the ending could come about. I just wish I had back the time that I wasted thinking about it.This film would have been brilliant and fun if it stayed along the lines of the first film and adopted part of ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"". Here's how I would have written it:An astronaut (it really should have been more than Marky Mark because he's not good enough to care a film all by himself so I would have put in three guys) that would land on what they would think would be another planet, encounter humans (not mutes), a city ruled by apes, were hunted, made friends with some good apes, discover that they're on earth via finding some destroyed ruins, end up running into crazy mutant humans living beneath the earth, a war breaks out between the mutant humans and the apes, and then....well, let your imagination run wild on how you want to end it.But my point is that there could have been so much more to this film. Sadly, Tim Burton really knows how to wreck a good thing. Consider what he did with the Batman series. He's a rotten director inspite what of people think. He's trendy so he must be good goes the thinking. Sorry, but no. If anyone else had done this film, it would have turned out far better and would have been far more satisfying.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It neatly and cleverly captured much of the social climate of the late 60s. Though not without its antecedents, it certainly has to stand as one of the more important social commentary films posing as sci-fi. Burton's remake, however, doesn't even seem to have a coherent story line. I first saw the Burton film upon its release and found it sorely lacking then. But I worried that my reaction might be too colored by my affection for the original. Remakes are frequently hated by fans of the original, and I didn't want to spout off with an unexamined emotional outburst. But I just sat through it again (this time on TV) and my loathing hasn't diminished. Wahlberg's performance still strikes me as wooden and lacking in purpose. From the very moment of his arrival to the ape world, his only objective is to escape from the planet. So why did he travel out to the planet in the first place? Heston's character of more than 30 years past at least went to explore (to see if there was anything better than man out there). Baker's ape makeup in the remake was good, but effects alone can't make a movie. The humans were no doubt the worst characters in the remake. Like Wahlberg they lacked any depth, and their passivity to ape domination produced more annoyance instead of sympathy. In the original the humans were primitive mutes whose mannerisms were bestial. They brought on pity one might feel for a hunted animal, which they were supposed to be. Another strikingly annoying element in the Burton film was the strange love triangle formed by Helena Bonham Carter as a chimp (albeit a very cute chimp), the collagen-lipped Estella Warren as a primitive human, and Wahlberg. I have no idea what Burton was going for there. While Burton's early films didn't wow me, they nonetheless didn't annoy me. My first impression was simply that he could churn out glitzy Hollywood pablum. Then he made Ed Wood and I suddenly wondered if I had overlooked a film genius. But the profound lack of substance in Apes convinces me that I was right the first time. (And Big Fish hasn't caused me to alter that view).","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Tim Burton has made some great films -- Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas, Ed Wood and Sleepy Hollow. He also made some turkeys in Batman Returns and Mars Attacks! Put Planet of the Apes down as another turkey, one of his worst.This movie is billed as of the Sci-Fi Action genre, but there is little science in it. We are supposed to believe that a chimp and later Captain Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) flies through a cosmic storm and is instantaneously transported through time into the future. Not only that, the ship that tries to save the insubordinate Davidson ends up crash landing on the same planet but in the present time. They were carrying a cage full of chimpanzees and one of them starts a colony on the planet. Some of the humans who survived start a human species, but yet on this future parallel world, for some unexplainable reason the chimpanzees evolve faster and become masters over the humans. The air and water is equal to that of our own Earth but mysteriously the planet was uninhabited before.Given the chance, Burton can make some great character driven and imaginative movies such as Batman, Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood. In Apes, he doesn't have a chance with the poorly written script and weak direction. The movie instead focuses more on the action and we don't see a buildup of Wahlberg's character except towards the end. Other characters are introduced, but there are few connections with the audience. Helen Bonham Carter's performance as Ari is worthy, but we don't know exactly why she feels a connection to humans enough to risk losing her life. Kris Kristofferson is there to be killed off. Tim Roth does a creditable job as the angry and malevolent General Thade, one of the descendants of first chimpanzees on the planet. Both Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa are good as Attar, General Thade's friend and trusted warrior Krull who is Attar's foil and Ari's guard.The cinematography, set designs, and technical aspects of the movie are fabulous. Rick Baker and Colleen Atwood does superb and remarkable work as the make up and costumes. Danny Elfman, who won an award for the Batman score, does a fantastic job again with Apes. This was a big budget picture and money was well spent in these areas.The ending made no sense whatsoever. If you get that far, suffice it to say the final scene looked as if it was added just so there would be some storyline in order to make a sequel. I truly hope the producers of this stinker lost so much money, they won't dare try again.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Tim Burton could have sexed up this simian saga & given the adults in the audience something to look at. Even the chaste Helena Bonham Carter never gets out of her costume which looks like a large curtain. She's cute but all the the love stuff is restricted to anxious looks & a little bitty kiss at the end. As in Artificial Intelligence which discusses inter species sex between robots & humans but never delivers - Planet of the Apes hints at inter species romance between the humans & the apes but only hints. Lisa Marie is the only ape that dares to be sexy. This movie has three great actors Tim Roth, Ms. Carter & Paul Giamatti chewing up the scenery as a trio of apes & they are fun to watch.

Well that's what has to do with the movie ""Planet of the Apes.""And as we are aware when making a pact with ""the devil"", it must bear the consequences.This ""Remake"" is a bunch of bland action movie any. The dwarf ""Tim Roth"" is really funny to want to do too much. Moreover it should stop doing action films of science fiction (as Al Pacino). This kind of movie is not really for people of small sizes. It is like seeing actresses frail and without muscles (Jennifer Garner, Jennifer Lopez, etc.). Making action movies. We do not believe it for a second. It is true that men only look at the beauty and forget the rest most of the time.Mark Wahlberg is bad as always. Looks like a guy who is always angry and frustrated. Like his brother also. Proof that he is wrong because he always plays the same roles.As against this film is very 21st century. A century that goes nowhere, based solely on the profile, money, money and more money. A century without moral or value except money. A century where we are when God has money. A century that saw the birth of trillionnaires and quadrillionnaires. A century or 95% of all the money in the world can be found in tax havens. A century or the capitalist system is considered divine. A century or 99% of all existing money in the hands of 0.0001% of the population. A century in which we only speak of crises. A century where there is normal to see everyone in debt, all cities in debt, debt across all states, provinces, territories indebted all indebted countries, all continents and all indebted indebted Earth. And during this time to see billions of billions of billions of billions in tax havens that will never do anything. A century where we find normal sale $ 20 a pill so that it is worth $ 0.00002. A century or bandits, are no longer.In Hollywood movies now 99% are only turnips. Action movies and / or science fiction with huge budgets and have no body. Films with special effects only always the same script.A century or ideas without a single idea: make money! A century where everything is uniform and lifeless. A century of Globalization.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

We even got twists and turns and when it was over, we felt we got our moneys worth. In this movie of the same subject, they broke the cardinal rule. They made or make the audience have to work out the movie instead of the movie entertaining them. Now there are some movies that risk this and leave you in an okay state from their efforts. However, if the work to be done is too complex, far out, too detailed and involves much explanation, then it wasn't a movie at all but instead a homework assignment. We become the movie and finish the tale to keep ourselves content and to have a sense of closure. There are some good scenes, acting, and high hopes here and there. But when you expect the paying audience to have to explain a movie so they can understand what they just saw? This is not the best approach and you can forget about a comeback experience. In other words, once is enough. If one likes the Planet of the Apes world, the novel it is based on and the stars like Wahlberg, by all means see the movie.

He also wars with the various tribes of apes, to deliver the promised land of equality to all... or some such thing. There's the chimp god from the stars, too.It's an entirely unwarranted remake. Although the makeup and CGI effects are OK, I, at least, had no desire to see an attractive, talking, super-intelligent chimpanzee, such as Helena Bonham Carter's Ari. Nor do I care for the suggestion of a love triangle between Ari, Whalberg's Moses stand-in and a female human, who unlike the original film's Nova, can talk, but still has nothing worth saying. Worse still, Tim Roth merely snarls and jumps around, jacked up on CGI, and the human boy who wants to be on the front lines is just laughable.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

A miserable script loaded with cliches is only the first of many objectionable aspects to this film.  This is the kind of movie where every time something happens, you'll be sure to hear someone shout out ""he's lost his gun!"" or whatever it is to let everybody know.  Carter is really awful and so is Wahlberg, who can't play this straight and be convincing.  Very nice effects and photography, but poor music in the John Williams mold by Burton's crony Elfman.  Heston appears in a nonsensichal scene to spout out his most famous catch-phrases from the first movie.  Very poor results.If anyone else out there also saw ""Sleepy Hollow"", they will probably have noticed, as I have, the declining quality of Burton's films.  I've heard that this particular project was produced by others and that Burton was brought in as director, in which case his judgement should be questioned. But I think he has allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip; the evidence is there in the films.  In ""Sleepy Hollow"", he couldn't decide what kind of movie he was making, whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie, and the population of british character actors (Chris Lee, etc.) made you also think it was kind of a monster rally film (those are never scary, as horror fans know).  The movie couldn't succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic, and no style had been developed to smooth the two together.  ""Planet of the Apes"" is much the same way, and the result comes off more like ""Total Recall"" or ""Tango and Cash"" than like sci-fi.  He's also fallen into the rut of so many other ""big"" directors of trying to satisfy the entire possible audience.  Word to Burton, if you're out there -- pick something and do it straight, or use some style to peice it all together (as in ""Mars Attacks"" or ""Beetlejuice"") or you might as well retire, because people like me that are fans of your movies will stop going.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I rarely get upset about a movie, but I am now: Terribly uninspiring, un-original and one-dimensional, one-way story, terrible acting, especially Wahlberg (who looks and talks like an idiot most of the time) and the blond chick (Warren?). Actually she is not acting at all but only trying to look good all the time. The only decent performances come from Bonham Carter and her big hulky gorilla companion during the escape (missed his name, some ex-General). Tim Roth is too one-dimensionally ""bad"" to be of any compelling interest. He should have declined this lame role.Terrible, senseless and completely out-of-the-blue ending after the (very poor and thin) ""story"" is concluded already. The costumes/make-ups and production design are good (2001, so no surprise) but do not save this movie at all.Tim Burton clearly can do better than this. I can't understand what he found in this script as he had a very heavy and uninspired hand here. Complete waste of time and money... utterly disappointing.

Maybe Fox didn't have enough yet?). And while I guess if by some dumb luck Burton is the right choice for a re-telling, but that's not the point.  He has made many fine re-makes (Batman the topper, also Mars Attacks, and Sleepy Hollow) but this isn't one of them.  This is in the overall view over-flashy, conventional (much, much more than the first if that one had any convention in the first place) and confusing. I mean, at least the ending in the first one was exciting and questioning. This one just almost says the point of this film was Back to the Future (or past) with primates.  Dumb logic.  Also the characters have less charm, humor and coolness that came with the first one; Wahlberg has nearly no emotions in scenes that parallel the ones in the first, and I can see why Heston is now Sir Heston.Only things to possibly watch for- a hilarious cameo from Sir Charleton Heston himself (I'd just as well sneak in the film for that one scene again), makeup that nearly matches the first one, although the first one was a breakthrough, and some OK visual effects.

Mark Wahlberg plays a United States Airforce space pilot who also trains, luckily for the plot, monkeys. It would be easy to harp on about paying peanuts, getting monkeys and other such witticisms. Instead of blindly denigrating this film, as many have done, it would seem more politic to look at the reasons why. Hammy acting, cliched one-liners, `Never send a monkey to do a man's job', for instance. Lack of plot; Star thrown into space turmoil, gets stranded on an unforgiving planet dominated by Apes. Apes catch star. Star escapes from potential slavery. Star gets home again safely. Everybody's happy. Apart from the audience. Widely slammed by critics and punters alike, and fairly so.

Ah... finally, this summer there is a true summer movie, featuring not only the big budget, cool special effects and the action, but also a seasonable plot and acting to rake in tons of teenagers' (as well as their parents') summer-job money.While I don't know/care to discuss the budget, it certainly went to good use.  The make-up effects are amazing (the make-up in the original was just as amazing when it was released, but look how far make-up artistry has come!); the big action scenes near the end featuring flank after flank of the ape army are truly a sight to behold.  Unlike in the original series, there are multiple species of ape on this planet, including chimpanzees, gorillas, and even a few orangutans.  All look amazingly realistic, physically way more intimidating than any ""human"" character could ever hope to be.  It must have been a nightmare for the actors under the makeup though.Besides, looking fantastic, the apes actually act like apes!  It's just so interesting and exciting to see an ape character such as General Thade yelling at someone in English, then jumping and climbing around, screeching in anger.  Next to that, it's really not possible for the human actors to contend at all... I mean they're not bad, but they are easily overshadowed by the apes, especially the soldiers, who not only look menacing, but through their harsh tones of voice and shrill screeches, are menacing.  It's too easy to forget that there were originally people underneath all those apes. Along with their appearance and manner, the apes' society is also interesting.  There is an ape religion, with the belief in a soul (and subsequent belief that the human ""animals"" don't have souls).  Other aspects of their society mentioned in the film include inter-special marriage (e.g. a chimp and an orangutan), a senatorial government, and humans, depending on age, sold as pets or slaves; there are even ""human rights"" activists.  While it may not offer as much social commentary as the original series, it's still enthralling enough, and it's great that the writers decided to offer details on the ape's religion, which is also a vital part of the plot near the end.  The only complaint I could offer about the society portrayed is that, like the original film series and unlike the book, the apes don't use vehicles.The unfortunate thing about summer films is that they usually end up sucking a few years later, as they are based solely on the special effects.  Tim Burton and crew have broken that mold with Planet of the Apes, which holds through all the way to the twist/ending (which is different from the original, and, though definitely an unexpected surprise, just a little bit of a let down).  See it for the special effects, and see it again for the intricacies of the ape society, religion and plot.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Case in question: the 2001 remake of one of the most famous sci-fi films of all time.I do have one confession. I've never actually seen the original 1968 film but I am familiar with the story. Here, astronaut Leo Davidson (played forgettably by Mark Wahlberg) crash lands on a distant planet ruled by intelligent apes. From there, he treks with a small band of outsiders towards these mysterious, ancient ruins which may hold the key for his return home.Where do I begin? Well, the cast is thoroughly wasted and this film has quite a cast (David Warner! Michael Clarke Duncan! Paul Giamattei!), the special effects are pretty generic, and the production design is slimy and claustrophobic. On top of all that, the final battle is very lackluster.Adding to all this, the ending is a joke. While the original film had an ending that was surprising and strangely appropriate, this one feels forced and confusing. Additional sore spots include a bland score by the usually reliable Danny Elfman and a pace that BEGS for a steroid shot.You may be wondering are there ANY redeeming values? Well, Charlton Heston's cameo is pretty good but since it is just a cameo, he's not in long enough to truly save it.What else can I say? This film stinks.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I wasn't really very happy to find out Mark Wahlberg was starring in it, but I've been wrong before about how someone can hold up a role so I decided to give it a go.As others have said, Tim Roth does a good job, Helena Bonham Carter is pretty decent, and most of the others are basically blase. Marky Mark, however, was a disaster. He has absolutely ZERO on-screen presence, he can't act well enough to even convince me that he is a human being, much less a astronaut, and the movie suffered badly because of this. I didn't care about his lead character, I had no idea what was going on in his head at any time, he never showed fear, anger, happiness, or any of the myriad emotions that most real people have. It was truly awful. Charleton Heston may have overacted in the 1968 version of this movie, but at least you could associate the word ""act"" with his performance. And Charleton had the on-screen presence that was so lacking in this version.Others have mentioned some of the various plot problems, including the ending, so I won't go into them except to say they are there and they make a number of plot events implausible. I would also like to point out that, once again (just as in the original POTA), the presence of horses on this ""planet"" is yet another obvious plot problem.As a straightforward action film the movie is pretty decent. The ape makeup and the ape movement is pretty damn good.Overall, I was considerably disappointed in this version of ""Planet of the Apes"" It had no originality, they chose the wrong leading actor, and the plot had huge holes. If you want to experience ""Planet of the Apes"" rent the original...it's so much better that there isn't really any comparison (except for the title). That's too bad, too, because this movie needed to be technologically updated.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Well, he made the kind of typical summer action fodder that could've been directed by anybody available out of film school...and in fact, they probably would've done a better job. They would've at least have put half of a thought into the dreadful script.Mark Wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through some sort of wormhole and landed in a planet ruled by apes. (gasp!) Except this time around, the apes squirm through groan-worthy dialogue, nonsensical plotting, and showy special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could've been put to about 10 independent films that would have been considered 'masterpiece' next to this tripe.As much as I enjoy the superb acting talent that is Tim Roth, his performance as evil ape leader Thade is nothing more than an intense composition of slouching and heavy breathing.  Luckily for him, the makeup allows he as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the crap-dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sniffles.And alas, the always dependable Hollywood tradition of taking the male and female leads and hooking them up at the end without any relationship development or cause. And the ""haha, we're so clever, aren't we?"" way that Hollywood intermingles references from the original POTA into this one. Sigh...Instead of seeing this, spend the night in and call up some friends and rent 'Ed Wood', 'Edward Scissorhands', 'Batman', or even to a lesser extent 'Sleepy Hollow', and reminisce about the days when Tim Burton was a man of vision and originality...not shame and ridicule.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The original movie stands as a classic of the sci-fi genre and many people, myself included, wondered why they choose to remake the movie. Fortunately the current _Planet of the Apes_ is more a reinterpretation of the material than than a remake of the movie and on that note it succeeds.However, the results are disappointing to put it mildly. There are enough plot holes to drive a Mac truck through. Often I found myself looking at my watch to see how much longer the movie would be lasting and felt my intelligence being assaulted. Some effects,  especially several jumps the apes make, would be more at home in _The Matrix_ than here. The occasional resused/reinterpreted line from the original movie are delivered poorly and come across as a weak attempt to pay homage to the original. While the story line itself was OK, plot holes aside, the script writing was lacking and the delivery of the lines by the actors more so. Interestingly enough, the best acting job is turned in by Charleton Heston who make a brief cameo appearance. Overall the production value was good, however, the apes village would be more at home in a fantasy movie than a sci-fi flick and as for the the much heralded make-up, I found it lacking, save for the gorillas. Of course one has to mention the ultimate ending of the movie which reeks of being tacked on and proves that sometimes movie makers just add too much footage for no good reason. The final few minutes should have wound up on the cutting room floor. All in all, it is a failure. Everybody makes a real stinker every now and then and Tim really has one here.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The epic battle at the end was very well-done and just plain badass. The makeup for the apes and the art direction were just sensational (as these two aspects always are in Tim Burton's films). The style is pretty un-Burton (there's no Gothic elements or anything like that) but it still immerses the viewer and Danny Elfman's score does a great job of putting us into the world. In blockbusters you're never really looking for great performances, but Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth were both very good.

Isn't the fundamental rule for science fiction/drama to create in the audience the willing suspension of disbelief.  POA 2001 creates a plausible beginning, suckering us in, but thereinafter Mr. Burton forgets that his moviegoers have working brains.  The over the top libertarian of Helena Bonham Carter's chimp, the worthlessness of the humans' lockup, the ease of their escape, their extraordinary skills of horsemanship (this is an astronaut and a group of human primitives suddenly riding full tilt), the massive and immediate human rebellion all are too unbelievable.  Mark Wahlberg never once projects any sense of real fear, danger or comeuppance in this world turned upside down.  Compare to the original, in which Chuck Heston's nakedness metaphorically captured his utter helplessness and astonishment at his turn of events.  The uniformed Wahlberg preserves his modesty, but also his apparent sense of management and control in an inherently wacky situation, and we never really wonder about his well being.  Unlike Heston, he seems never to be in real jeopardy.  Tim Burton should have used some of the f/x budget for some competent screenwriting.  In fact, after this inferior fiasco, I wonder why Hollywood's producers ever bothered to settle the screenwriters and directors strike threats. Let them walk.  Trained monkeys could have done as well as they did in Planet of the Apes 2001.  I'll bet the repeat viewings of this effort will be nonexistent.  It could have been a new franchise, and a wonderful new step for imagination.  Another opportunity lost.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Do they think we're stupid?  Do they think we will accept anything they put on the screen just because it has special effects?  What was the point of making this film?Despite being very courageous to even attempt re-making such a popular and well known movie, the perpetrators of this waste of time and effort seem to have forgotten some of the cardinal rules of movie making.  It's great to have special effects and lots of make-up artists working for you but a decent screenplay and some talented actors might have helped, too.  The actors in this debacle were one dimensional, at best, with the most believable character being that of Pericles.  There was little if any development of the characters and there was no  hint of the messages found in the original.The worst part of all of this is that the altered ending of the movie opens up the opportunity for a sequel.

I will say this: the performances were good, there was nothing especially WRONG with the directing, and the effects and makeup were everything that you would expect, but in many respects, this drivel reminds me of another ill-conceived sci-fi project.  You could probably guess what that is by the title of my comment.Battlefield Earth has been panned non-stop by critics all over the world, but is this really much better?  Come on...This film's ending is the most incoherent copout I've seen in years.  The script is completely unoriginal, the action sequences are muddled and unexciting, and the attempts at comedy are cringe-worthy.  Both are big budget mistakes.  The only difference is that this one was successful (and ok...maybe not quite so laughable).  The fact that this film has at this point grossed around $US350 million internationally is a huge indictment on the intelligence of your average human being.  If you haven't seen it yet, don't.  If you want some decent sci-fi entertainment, see Jurassic Park 3.  It may not be the epitome of originality, but at least it delivers what it says it will.Tim Burton was, until this film, a symbol of originality, style, and great black humour, but this could just as easily have been directed by Michael Bay (except he'd probably find some way to sneak in a dogfight between the apes and humans in F-15s so there'd be more explosions).To Mark Wahlberg, pick better projects.To John Travolta, you're finally almost off the hook.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It had a lot more to it than a simple sci-fi flick. Everyone agrees with that.  Did I expect this remake to be up to the same level?  No.  I went in with a fresh perspective, letting the movie stand on its own.  What a mistake that was.One plot' point that bothered me was all the people wanting to see the man who defies the apes, since they defy the apes every day by congregating in roving bands of scavengers evading capture.  Also, there is a difference between giving the ending a hanging twist, the sort that requires you to think, and incomprehensible one.  Oh, and the two swiped lines from the original (""Get your stinking hands off me..."" and ""Damn them..."") had the feeling of being forced into the script.  They just did not flow.Warren is a horrible actress.  Wahlberg was fairly stiff.  Bonham-Carter was a caricature.  Roth was the stereotypical mister-mean-man.  The script was just plain weak and the craft of storytelling was nonexistent.So, I thought I would read the book.  Let's see, the beginning was nothing like the book, the ending had little in common with the book, the middle wasn't really that much like the book.  However, there were talking apes... So, yeah, it was similar in that respect.I am glad I only rented this.  Well, not really.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie just happens to be one of those movies.  Mark Walhberg was not the cause of this movie to stink, nor was it the acting in general.  I liked the acting and the special effects.  However, the story and script should never had made it past the producers.  In fact, I am surprised the ink in the pen wanted to write it out.  This whole story does nothing but tarnish the original movies good name.  I literally, as soon as I left the cinema went and rented the original Planet of the Apes to wash the bad taste this one left in my mouth.Let's compare the new movie to the old;Actors: Charlton Heston & Mark WalhbergWhile Hestons brand of acting may not appeal to all, it IS brilliant acting. Mark Walhberg is an up and coming star, this is true, but for him to rise to the level that Heston sits upon, Mark is going to have to start looking for some seriously good scripts and take some more acting lessons, maybe even from Heston himself.  ADVANTAGE: OriginalSupporting Ape Cast Old & Supporting Ape Cast NewApes are Apes but there are aspects from both the new and old films that I liked.  The Original movie had Dr.Zira and Dr.Cornelius and who could forget Dr.Zaius, who were all pretty great characters which added a lot of character interaction and development for Hestons character(Taylor). While the new movie has Ari? An Ape with a serious case of the hots for Walhbergs character(Leo).  ADVANTAGE: OriginalSupporting Human Cast Old & Supporting Human Cast NewBased on the fact that the original only had Linda Harrison as Nova, I have to give the advantage for this class to the new movie.  ADVANTAGE: New MovieSpecial Effects:While the old has some fantastic sites where they shot the film, we do have to give the new movie the advantage in the special effects department. The only thing I really did not like where the Gorillas that were leaping distances of 30 or so feet.  Advantage: New MovieStory:Well this is the big kahuna.  The old movie had an amazing script.  The new movie was geared too much towards quick action where the old movie was a lot of character development with enough action to keep it interesting.  After watching the new movie there were definite aspects that I really would have liked to see in the old movie.  Such as the fact that the Apes were using primitive weaponry.  Makes sense.  Also they lived in the trees, again.. makes sense.   I was very dissappointed when the humans in the new movie opened their mouths and could speak perfect english.  WOW, it's actually very  difficult to see, at least in my point of view, how the apes could regard humans, that can speak just as eloquent english as they.. AS SAVAGES. Or question whether or not they have souls??  Hello?!?!  I thought the whole reason they were ""savages"" was because they could not be taught, were stupid and were almost neanderthalic in behavior.  What I saw in the new movie was an excuse to have at least a few more characters for Walhberg to talk to since they did not have the character interacton with the Apes. I liked the idea or Thade.. but he was just a tad bit too insane for my liking, then again, maybe there just wasn't enough character developement for me to like him.  Overall.. ADVANTAGE: Original
In short, this movie is a waste of time, don't see it, don't rent it, don't buy it.  I give it 4 thumbs down","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Being a big fan of the original film I hoped that this new version would come some way near its excellence. In my opinion it came nowhere near. Many key elements of the original were changed, but why? To cater for today's audiences? So as not to be accused of copying the original? If Tim Burton or anyone else could make a decent copy of the original that would be great. Why were all the humans able to speak? The actors who played humans didn't even have anything decent to say so it would have been preferable to have had them mute. Yeah the script was that bad and surely the muteness was an integral part of the original. The film had some 'to be expected' special effects but no substance while the original had very little in the way of special effects and so much more substance. It seems that Tim Burton used the cover of special effects (like so many other film directors these days) to hide a poor script. There are many other aspects of the film which I could comment on but I don't want to give any of the plot away so I'll refrain. I suppose you must expect a remake to be of inferior quality, you only need to look at the vast majority of remakes to know this. This film, unlike its predecessor, will not stand the test of time.

This group of films could include movies such a The Fly, The Thing, and some others. The criteria to be a part of this selection would be that every new remake should try to take distance from the seminal classics. Those old and dear movies are classics, there's no sense in make the same movie using the same script and so. If there's any need of release a remake it is necessary a new take on the same tale.Tim Burton has done just that with his version of Planet of the Apes, and also has made the whole myth of this saga his own. Leo Davidson is a hard action astronaut but still he's very innocent just like many of the heroes of Burton. And these Apes who are a distorted image of us as society (greedy, intolerant). The special apes that don't follow these ideologies are the good sensitive beings. I think this is probably one of the most important messages in every good movie of Tim Burton, the special outsider view of the artist in a world who's not sensitive.Owning an amazing design of make-up, scenarios, and lots of practical FX, P.O.A is honest to the old fashion style of Sci-Fi .This is the remake that the seminal classic of 1968 deserves. A great cast of actor and actresses is here and they deliver over the top performances even wearing pound of Makeup! This new version pays homage to the first Planet from the first minute to the last. It deserves an absolute 10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I sincerely CANNOT understand why everyone hates on this movie so much! I don't think it's perfect or anything, like, I feel Mark Wahlberg is a bit miscast here (even though I'm still a big fan of his work). This film had some really cool ideas, that they were, unfortunately, never allowed to explore/expand. I feel that if we had gotten a sequel to this one, perhaps explaining that ending a bit, this film maybe looked at a bit differently...IDK. The makeup is impressive, the performances (for the most part, again, still not the biggest fan of early Wahlberg here) and the score...OMG, Danny Elfman's score here's one my favorites of his! I have ALWAYS loved this movie, and know that I'm older, I appreciate it even more; bummed out that we never got the follow-up to it.

Firstly I think the make-up of the apes and the way they move is outstanding, the whole look of the film is excellent. The music by Danny Elfman is great. Tim Burton does a great job directing the action. I thought all the actors were great, apart from Wahlberg who I find a little wooden, I thought the same about him in The Italian Job but he's not that bad. Tim Roth is the best and makes a great villain, one of his best performances since Rob Roy I feel. I'm actually surprised how many of the IMDB users seem to hate this film, probably because the ending doesn't seem to make sense. I too found the ending baffling but I enjoyed the ride in getting there. I must say It took me a long time to get round to seeing this movie, I eventually picked it up very cheaply in a supermarket and I'm glad I bought it. Sadly I think the overall reaction to this film has killed any chances there were of there being a Planet of the Apes II. Pity because I would have loved to have to seen how they would have tried to explain the ending. Also I must say I enjoyed this Tim Burton film a lot more than some of his others namely Batman Returns and Mars Attacks, I think he delivered a great movie here. Oh well each to their own ***7/10***","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

the movie was very low on character developments, i can hardly remember any names save Leo, the main hero, and some 2-3 more. one thing that bugs me a lot is the female apes. the way they're portrayed is simply.. disturbing.. i dunno maybe it's just me. and the human blonde babe! she's obviously being paid for simply walking around in that jungle outfit and looking worried (and pretty at the same time). she's hot, though. and mark wahlberg is just plain bad here. i like him in some other movies like three kings, but here he just dont have that hero feel.the script needed a lot of work, with lots of plot holes (why did/didn't he do this?/ why does this happen when that doesn't?). but while everyone bitches about the ending, i kinda like it, as it finally grabbed my attention, there, right at the end of the flick.disappointing movie, really.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But costume and make up and acting is 10/10. I believe even today it beats CGI ape-pination, and acting as apes by those actors was top notch, because it was civilized and humanized apes which in my opinion makes it true to the picture of the film. They are not too ape-ish and not too human-ish. If the movie was a bit longer and there's was a bigger human vs ape story in the planet of the apes, it may have been a big hit. But it is still a really good Planet of the Apes film. It just that expectations was too high for such a big franchise.

Shown not least by all the completely wasted remakes floating around out there. And it seems remakes are all the rage today, considering how many movies are actually based on previous works. Right now the Asian industry is the one being plagued the worst by this trend.When it comes to unnecessary remakes i would have to rate this 2001 remake of the classic ""Planet of the apes"" as one of the foremost. This version of the movie is not without it's qualities, but in general it's a step down from the original in many ways. The social pathos is more or less completely removed, replaced instead with a focus on action and comedy. While the original movie commented on segregation in society and the arbitrary treatment of certain groups as lower standing, this movie doesn't deal with the themes at all. Of course there is a general discussion going on through the movie, and a tension between liberal and conservative powers, but it never feels like more than window dressing.The qualities here lie mostly in the sure-handed visual style that is director Tim Burtons hallmark. The effects as well as the set designs are top notch, as is the sound and music. The acting leaves a mixed impression. Tim Roth is quite astounding as the evil ape commander Thade, Mark Wahlberg is his usual pale self as the protagonist. The acting from the rest of the cast is decent enough.The qualities of this remake fall tragically short of making up for it's weaknesses. I feel that a remake should always have something new to offer if there is to be a point in remaking a movie in the first place. Not only does this movie have nothing new to offer, it even deducts many of the points of the original. And that makes this one of the most pointless, and even degrading, remakes ever. I rate it 3/10 for the entertainment it still provides despite it's obvious weaknesses as a remake.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Someday somebody will make a great movie about it. Until then you'll have to watch this one:Wahlberg is lost on a strange planet and who of all people does he encounter? Kris Kristofferson! Complete with his groomed beard portraying some kind of a caveman. One wonders why he isn't wearing cowboy hat and boots. Then we have little Tim Roth as a British(?) chimp. Burton orders: ""You're a chimp! Act like one! Make at least 10 grimaces a second!"" And Roth obeys. He is the bad chimp, so he tries to look really mean, but doesn't. Roth also hops around a lot. It's real method acting, you know. As if the bad apes aren't, well, ""bad"" enough, there are also ""good"" apes, who talk like liberals, so the kids who watch this mess hopefully will turn out as ""good"" citizens one day. Of course they won't listen to the drivel of the good apes. It's too boring. Talking of boring: Wahlberg gets captured by the bad apes in a boring way and soon escapes in a boring way. Then he's on the run and has to talk a lot to the other humans and a female chimp (Carter) which has the desire to be just as smart as him. Sometimes we see Roth the chimp, who wants Wahlberg back. he gives orders to his favorite gorilla, then hops out of frame for the most time. At the end he and a lot of other apes get whacked in the head by Wahlberg and his feel-good-posse. Some big apes roll around on the floor in deadly combat. The final duel belongs to Wahlberg and Roth the little chimp, which leaves the monkey completely bonkers. Finally a real chimp saves the day and shows Roth and the others how to act. Obviously Burton had no influence on the animal. The last minutes gives us a tiny impression what this remake maybe should have been about, would it have been made by a director with a vision.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Less filling! Costumes, makeup, sets, direction, acting, all were adequate or better for a sci-fi action flick. I liked how the apes were more apelike than in the original. But the writing...Almost all the tension of the original was missing. About twenty minutes in the story arc was readily apparent, I figured out the time loop, and started to predict just about every major plot point before it happened.Then, there was the ending. At least what had come before had mostly made sense (allowing for some real puzzles, like why was a research ship obviously not built to land carrying horses?). In the original POTA, the ending not only managed to answer all the questions the rest the film posed while remaining completely consistent to the rest of the story, it was surprising because it wasn't an answer you expected. With this one the ending is unnecessary, as the story loop is already complete; totally inconsistent with the plot; and surprising only because it is so completely illogical. For me, the ending knocked a 'six' (mindless fun) down to a 'four' (just mindless).  With no reasonable expectation of a successful return to his own time (not to mention, no way of getting back to Earth with only a service pod) he should've just stayed there. Human/Ape society, and this movie, would've been the better for it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

A totally needless exercise. What is the point of remaking a perfectly good film made less than 30 odd years ago? Put simply, it's because Hollywood has run out of ideas. Why waste effort trying to create something new when it can simply rehash superb older movies and create garbage.For all you people out there who've never seen the original I urge you to. It's a wonderful and powerful film with a truly exciting and surprising ending, which if you don't know will come as a startling shock.I saw this 2001 abomination when it first opened I was hoping that perhaps Burton might be able to do something with it - sadly, Burton did. He took a fantastic film and turned it into a turkey, filling it with tedium, nonsense, overblown effects and Walhberg. It's so obviously a film made by committee - 'we can't have the humans silent! We need a sexy, strong female freedom fighter, we need massive war! We need sexy female apes! And we need to out-shock the original film's ending with an ending so shocking, the audience will leave their seats shocked by the shocking revelation of it all!' Boy, was I shocked.There's so much wrong with this film I'm not going to even try.Don't waste your time with this, don't waste your money.It was shown on TV recently and I thought I'd give it another go and work out when it goes off the rails. Actually it's not difficult to spot. It's happens just after the main credits have finished rolling.I'm surprised the entire film isn't just listed in the goof list.Goof - the entire film.Avoid and save a precious couple of hours of your life. Because when you're lying on your death bed wishing you had a few more hours of life left, you're gonna wish you hadn't wasted them with this trash.

Thus, it is worth to be seen even by die-hard fans of the original movies.Mark Wahlberg can never match the quality of Charlton Heston, and was probably not a good choice, but the Apes are even more realistic and differentiated than in the old movies, as far as their characters are concerned. The girl which was Nova in the 1968 movie is also much more intelligent and has more to offer than just to look good.All the cruelty of manhood is being shown to as like in a fable on the example of the monkeys - sorry, apes! This content alone makes it really hard to create a bad movie upon it.Planet of the Apes (2001) is really worth the money, it has impressive shots to offer, a smooth storyline, interesting characters and an idea which should make us think about ourselves and our history.Only the end is really poor and doesn't fit the rest of the movie. It looks as if this was only added to ensure future sequels. It is very primitive and doesn't match the quality of the actual movie.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Meanwhile, if you watch the behind the scenes making of this film, you also get the distinct impression that Tim Burton knew the script was crap and so he gave up on it and treated it like a joke that he was getting big bucks for delivering. Which it is.But having said all that, I have a suggestion for a sequel. In the sequel, Wahlberg, Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Burton play themselves. They all get into a spaceship and try to go back in time to change the future where no remake of the Planet of the Apes will appear on their resume. After 2 1/2 hours of mindless hijinks and special effects, they emerge in modern day to find they didn't change a thing, because as Alec Baldwin's character states so glibly in Glengarry Glen Ross: ""a loser is a loser!""And anyone who read the script for this film and didn't walk away was -at least in this instance - a loser.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I waited thirty years for this freak show. Numbingly disappointing. A gargantuan gas bag of celluloid claptrap. Tim Burton's dreadful spin on a four-star classic renders off a slickly produced, but lethal aroma of a movie, that, when looked at closely, would have even the gorillas at the Bronx Zoo scratching their heads in disbelief. Burton's big mistake (I think) was creating a different, unfamiliar ape universe from the previous series. Strangely, I believe the film he achieved in remaking here was the Wizard of the Oz. Mark Walberg, the lead, is no Charlton Heston. He's too short and grim. Someone needed to tell him to lighten up. He spends the entire film behaving like ""Dorothy."" I know. I know. He wishes to go home despite meeting two potential love connections--one human, one ape. AND he starts a global civil war for good measure. Nice fellow. He mopes around the planet like some kind of self-centered jerk. Tim Roth's character is the worst kind of evil: boring. He jumps around the cheap sets as if he was suffering from a terminal case of ants-in-his-pants. I did, however, enjoy Danny Elfman's pulsating score. And Rick Baker's make-up for the apes deserved more recognition and some awards. Also, I felt the Christo-like red tents, that the ape army used on their march across the wasteland, were beautiful and abstract. There are occasional stabs at social commentary--but they fall flat. Rod Serling and Pierre Boulle must be turning over in their graves.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

First of all, Mark Wahlberg phoned this one in, and I can't blame him. His character never showed any real concern with the plot, his only concern was to get back to his ship. That is fine, but when the storyline (macro level -ape vs man, micro level the humans on this planets apparent desire to rebel against the apes) hinges on the hope that he will- he is the humans savior. He doesn't care, and any effort to care seems half hearted at best. The writing is terrible, wasteful and at times just stolen and ba****dized. If we aren't supposed to compare this movie to the original, then why did they steal superb lines from the original and force them into this one? Early in the movie, on the spacestation, one of the scientists tells Wahlbergs character that the female apes are the aggressive ones. I thought at that point there would be a female general on the planet of the apes. Was there? No. Did that line ever come into play? No. So why have it in the movie? It didn't further the plot, it wasn't funny, it wasn't interesting, it provided nothing at all. Is this nit picking? Perhaps, but it just goes to show how unattached the people making this movie(and films in general) are to the point of cinema. Shakespeare never wasted a word, and here these people are, using millions of dollars to produce a story and they can't even get a quality script written. All this movie is a chase scene, but the end of the battle scene is ridiculous, the only way the writers could save their hero, and the apparent peace that arises between man and ape is forced because no real discussion of the topic occurs. The ending makes no sense, only cents- it is the launching pad for a sequel to try to explain what the hell happened. I'll only touch on the awful directing (hey Burton- why does everything important have to happen when it is dark) and the complete lack of attention to detail (Estella Warren's character was supposed to be the love interest- but the female ape and wahlberg had more chemistry, ape costumes looked just like ape costumes.) Did anyone else notice that at the bottom of the lake in which Marky Marks spaceship crashed was brighter than the dark jungle in which he crashed? Do the fish in that pond have lightbulbs? This movie was the pits- and if fits right in with the rest of the garbage I've seen this year.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Many of his previous movies broke new ground artistically, like Beetlejuice, The Nightmare Before Christmas and Ed Wood.  They were wildly imaginative, visually intriguing and entertaining.  That is why I was so excited to learn that Burton was directing Planet of the Apes.  I expected him to take the classic Apes from the 60's and give it his own Burtonesque twist.  I expected ingenuity and to be immersed into a weird futuristic ape world.  What I got was a modern-day Hollywood formula movie.  It is as if all the creativity and intrigue of the original had been beaten out of the film.You know the story.  An astronaut crash-lands onto a strange planet ruled by primates.  Humans are on the planet too, but the humans are considered `animals' and are treated as slave labor.  The biggest problem with Planet of the Apes (2001) is that it is simply not captivating.  There is no discernable plot, except that the astronaut wants to get back to his mother ship, and the apes want to make him their slave (or kill him.)  And while other `slice of life' films may not need a plot to succeed, sci-fi epics do. There is nothing compelling here to move the action and characters (and us) forward.  The result is . . . boredom.  Burton's job at a minimum with this film was to entertain us.  He fell far short.Mark Wahlberg plays astronaut Captain Leo Davidson in a performance that is largely inconsequential.  Helena Bonham Carter is Ari, a female ape (and unspoken love interest) who cares about the plight of the humans. Carter's performance is measured and effective.  Tim Roth portrays Thade, the leader of the ape army.  Roth is a fine actor whose performance here is at times captivating, and at other times one-dimensional.  The actors who play the humans, Kris Kristofferson and Estella Warren, are almost as unimportant as Wahlberg.  I liked the original movie better when the humans just grunted. Also, Charleston Heston even shows up in disguise to waste away a scene with us.To be fair, the makeup and special effects in Planet of the Apes are well done.  The costumes and sets are all good, if not too dark (but the art direction is disappointing when compared with Burton's previous works).  The music, by Danny Elfman, is great, if not distracting.The film's final scene, which I will not give away, has been deemed by some as clever or cool.  I think not.  Imagine if you will, what closing visual would be as evocative as the Statue of Liberty scene in the original movie? I guarantee that if you allow your mind to wander, you will guess it. That's not innovation, that's more of the same from Hollywood.  What happened Tim?","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The scenery was very beautiful, the photography...breathtaking; the lush forest, the expansive wasteland, the dark brutish city.Leo Davidson  (Mark Wahlberg) is a flyer for the Air Force on a floating base in space itching to fly out of there into the deep and do his job.  But instead they send the genetically altered monkeys, just like canaries into a mine.Well Leo's furry fellow astronaut is in trouble out in space and Leo goes out there to bring him and the flying pod back in an unauthorized rescue mission. And as you can probably guess, from there things take an unexpected turn. Crashing into a simian world Leo has to fight the persistent General Thade (Tim Roth) and his army of apes.  General Thade has a merciless hatred for humans which is boundless and unexplained.  And so the story flows from one battle scene to another.The story is simple and therefore easy to understand; the battle for survival.   The battle for freedom from slavery.  The battle for dignity and self determination.The fantastically twisted ending leaves an opening for a sequel.  Usually it disappointments me when a movie leaves too many loose ends for the purpose of creating a sequel; but this is not the case here.  This movie and it's story is over and leaves an opening for (I hope) another exciting movie.`SweetVenom' Bob","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The make-up, costuming, characterization, even the quadrupedal movements by some apes; excellent stuff. Bonham-Carter's work was fine, although she looks like she just had a wardrobe malfunction or something. By the way, she's in so many Burton films, you'd almost think she knows the guy. Anyway, all positives are lost amidst a big, dumb, growling, lumbering primate of a flick.Some astronaut ends up in a post-Apocolyptic world filled with evolved primates, directly adapted from the original. But, after that, the story resorts to Sunday afternoon serial tactics, and throws cerebral thought into the tar pits. A battle scene where bodies are constantly being tossed in the air: come on. The whole battle scene is just a mass of extras shouting, grunting, and slashing each other to bits. But no meaning to why it's being fought, or what the outcome means.Loud stupid, unintentionally campy. The director's paycheck was unearned. Beware the farcically moronic ending; it's so utterly ridiculous that it's sidesplitting.

Which is bad.  Very very bad.I went in expecting a good movie that would live up to the name of the franchise, despite the presence of Burton in the director's chair.I cannot believe a story resembling an early draft and not much more than a comedy sketch in someone else's production would have received final approval and the go-ahead by an entire studio.When it's available on video (DVD), watch this along with the original 1968 Apes.  If you care for nothing more than MTV special effects, maybe you'll come away with a distaste for the original.  But if you value any type of consistency and plausible story, in an implausible world, then the newest Apes movie will leave you wanting a lot more.  Not even Helena Bonham Carter nor Tim Roth, both whom put forth excellent performances, could save this picture.  Paul Giamatti was brilliant - his performance might have been a little too comedic over-all, but again, that was a problem with the writing. His performance was stellar.  Mark Wahlberg has chosen far better roles in the past.Ah, Burton signs his name on another ruined production.  He certainly has earned his over-rated respect directing this type of swiss-cheesed fluff. The picture does nothing to advance the state of cinematography or story telling.  It adds an easily forgettable movie to the Apes line-up.  If nothing else, at least a sequel, with someone else handling direction, doesn't stand much chance of being any worse.POTA-2001 earns a solid (1) rating.  Wahlberg offers a one liner which would sum this picture.  I'm only paraphrasing... ""you shouldn't send apes to do a man's job"" - and that there points to one of the biggest holes in the entire story.  No spoilers though.  Watch it for your own opinion, but do yourselves the favor of going in expecting very little.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

When remaking the 1960's classic, it created some ticket sales because of the original franchise. The trouble with this remake is that the golly-gee whiz special effects of today are put in as replacements for the original dramatic script of the past epic film.The result is definitely mixed, and skewed towards the lower end of the scale. The remake is so focused on using these new special effects, they create a new ending for this film which is truly horrible compared with the original Rod Sterling epic.The story of reverse evolution theory is classic with Ape evolving from man, and Tim Burton's legion of fans might get a kick out of this, but my take is to see the original. It tells the story better and is dominated by drama more than special effects.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This ""re-imaging"" was so vastly inferior to that, that it's a wonder the script ever got greenlit to begin with.  I had heard that the film was bad, but I liked the original so much I rented it when it came out on video anyway. What a mistake.I didn't simply dislike this version because I'm a fan of the original, it is truely a horrible horrible film.  The script is pathetic and the ending seems like it was made by someone under the influence of heavy narcotics who didn't care about whether it made sense or fit into the movie or not.
This film is almost ridiculously campy with the bad dialogue and lines thrown into it simply to elicit a slight grin beased on a connection from the first film.  The apes act ridiculous and you're never left with the feeling that this could actually happen given the absurd things they do. I'm surprised Burton didn't throw in a monkey car that runs on bananas or something.  There's even a little dwarf that runs around collecting money like a chimpanzee would do at the circus.  Even if they took all the ""ape camp"" out, it's still a pathetic movie. Mainly because of the script and the horrible directing by Burton.  The stunts look pretty bad and fake. Many things don't make sense, like why apes would ride horses if they can move faster than horses anyway.  Even Wahlberg gives a pathetic performance.The only entertainment value in this entire movie is the ""funny"" things that an ape society does that compare with what humans do.  The only redeeming thing about renting this trash was that it was the best sounding DVD I've ever heard, and REALLY gave my 5.1 surround system a work.  Almost worth the rent to check it out until some better DVDs come along that have sound work as good.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

After all wasn't this the man who had brought us Edward Scissorhands, Sleep Hollow and BeetleJuice.But after seeing the film all I can say is stick to gothic horror Tim. It doesn't engage at any a level, its not exciting, not at all interesting, predictable and worst of all the shock ending makes no real sense. It does look 'authentic' and the make-up was first class with Tim Roth and Helen Bonham Carter doing their best to kick some life in a hack script.

But this ape film not only undercuts the original (while trying to look oh-so-much-more impressive), it also trivializes the novel by Pierre Boulle.Pierre Boulle's novel was a fable exploring the post-WWII problems of racism, nationalism, war and nuclear war. The world had already danced close to the brink of self-extermination in WWII: if we believe all the reports (and alas, there's no reason to doubt any of them), some 150 million people lost their lives during ten years of one major conflict after another, from the invasion of Manchuria and the Spanish Civil War to VJ day. That was a larger number than that of the population of the US at the time.Military-Industrial Complex profiteers notwithstanding, it became clear to intelligent people across the globe that ethnocentrism was not healthy for children and other living things, and it was a decent person's duty to say so as clearly and decisively as possible. ""Planet of the Apes"" may not be a great classic of literature, but it's no throwaway for a rainy day.To rip the heart and mind out of Boulle's story - well, what is the point? The world doesn't need yet another ""alternate universe"" comic book display of flexing ape muscle and tasteless jokes masquerading as wit. If all this is merely taking place in an ""alternate universe"", just so we can have a peek at a possible ""alternate universe"", then the ""adventure"" is nothing more than the protagonist's daydream.All we can do is shout ""Wake up!"" at protagonist and film-makers alike, and hope never to see such a self-indulgent waste of money on a theater screen again.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Instead what audiences receivedwas a pathetic, unengaging,poorly executed load of overblown B.S Tim Burton seemed to very removed from his usual hands-on approach that made his best work so imaginative.

But she was conducting it aboard a sinking ship.Weeks after this 2001 version opened (to 120 MILLION dollars worth of box-office!) the tragedy of 9/11 occurred, and it was quickly forgotten-where it has remained at the very bottom of Tim Burton's resume.And judging from most every other comment on this board, the bottom of the barrell-period!It never should have been made-plain and simple","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Although it is very spectacular, the main thought of the original story is lost in it. This thought was that the humans became animals and the apes are the superior species. Humans are not only unable to speak but even to think. They are driven by their instinct. Apes are not only able to speak and to think but they even walk righted. The only ""good"" thing in this film is the ending that gives back the ending of the book. Although the ending of the original movie was not bad as well. It made the possibility to make some sequence for it. This movie can not be continued (Thanks for the Lord for all the small miracles!) and has a very stupid story with a very stupid beginning. Don't waste your time, watch the original instead. 0.1 out of 10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Near the end, the astronaut chimp that Leo Davidson (Wahlberg) lands on the planet, days after Davidson did, but he was behind the chimp in the shuttles when leaving the spacestation, which did not ring true with the story! and the twist ending was a bit odd, but possible, the odd thing about it was the apes as 70's style over-the-top cops, I assume made intentionally like that.Mark Wahlberg plays it Ok, however he did not look too surprised to discover the apes and the fact that humans populated this new planet in a different time, also his dialogue was a bit quick at times. But apart from that it was good, The others did ok, Helena Bonham Carter was quirky, but the best was Tim Roth as General Thade, you can see he put his all into the character. Charlton Heston and Linda Harrison from the original even had cameos in this.It was made well, the Ape costumes were much better than the originals, hardly surprising. the scenes were good, and photography excellent, as were the special effects.It does not have the style of the original, so that is why I only gave it an 8 rather than 10 for that, but apart from that it is very good, apparently Tim Burton wanted longer time and more control over it, but didn't get it, if he had I think it might have been a lot better.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"","","Dumb and disappointing","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512425/?ref_=tt_urv","sibisi73","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1134263/?ref_=tt_urv","20 August 2001","It's indicative of today's Hollywood machine, that a great story, with real bite, and genuine originality, can be so mercilessly reduced to just another action blockbuster. It's also very depressing to realise that the director responsible was once a 'maverick', with a unique take on his usual subjects, with a propensity to stay away from the commercial, and eke out the esoteric.Tim Burton's re-imagining required little imagination at all. Comparison with the original 1968 film is, obviously, unavoidable, which is as it should be. Because only with this comparison can you see what a major disappointment this version is. Practically all essence of the themes of evolution, religion, the questions of the way we treat our planet, and the way we treat each other (which are probably more pertinent in this age of genetic modification and cloning etc) are either ignored or dealt with swiftly to bring on the next set piece. Charlton Heston's spaceman has to deal with an inability to communicate with both the apes and the humans (through his lack of speech and their lack of understanding) making him an outsider from both species. We go through that wonder and frustration with him. In Burton's film there are no such devices, we are simply given the 'us and them' option, and all philosophising is glossed over in order to accommodate the next chase. Which is what this movie ultimately turns into..one chase after another. The original's council meeting is replaced with a flippant, and jokey dinner party scene. And, tellingly, there are no allusions to human experiments, instead it appears that humans are good enough as slaves and not much else. One of the many lasting images from the 1968 version is Heston's discovery of his lobotomised co-astronaut. It makes no sense that humans who can communicate with one another, and who outnumber the apes by four to one are not the ruling species. Just one of the holes in a weak and dumbed down plot.Much has been made of the ending, but here, at least, Burton has the sense to at least try something unexpected. Once again, however, he has fluffed it in order to quicken the pace. The apes seem incredibly open to the suggestion that the humans were there first, just as Leo gets over the shock of talking apes rather swiftly so, too, do these apes have an unlikely ability to accept Leo's 'understanding' and explanation of 'Calima'. Heston finding the doll in the cave at the denouement of the first movie is a revelatory moment for both audience and ape - nothing in the remake surprises us much.If you can forget the original (or if you haven't seen it), and if you can bypass the dire script, there are things to enjoy here. Although the first half is far too set bound (with some unimaginative CGI), the climactic battle scenes are very well realised. So, too, are the apes themselves, with some incredible make-up effects, and physically engaging performances (mainly by the extras!). Tim Roth injects the much needed energy in a scene-chewing, but also scene-stealing turn as General Thade, arguably the highlight of the whole picture, and Charlton Heston's cameo is good fun, the only glimpse of any humour and irony in the movie. Paul Giamati's slave trader is simply embarrassing.Major disappointment all round.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Where is the man who gave us wonderful and entirely unique movie experiences such as Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas and Sleepy Hollow? My theory is that he desperately wanted that his films make money again after the not-too-enthusiastically-received likes of Ed Wood and Mars Attacks, (how else can you explain his fruitless endeavour to resurrect the Superman franchise?) and after the relative success of Sleepy Hollow, he managed to gain access to Fox's resurrection of the Planet of the Apes franchise. However, I think that the studio interfered heavily with this ""reimagining"" of their beloved franchise and prevented him from making a usual Tim Burton film. The result is a terribly ordinary action adventure which is also an insult to the tradition of pessimistic sci-fi films that the original was so proudly part of. I cannot believe that my favourite director has his name stamped on this. I feel really deserted and I'm sure there are many Burton fans out there who feel the same way as I do.

Had missed much of the hype, though with it being Tim Burton, I looked forward to it. I cannot say that i was hugely disapointed, and certainly I cannot agree with much of the over-reaction of many of the reviews - it is neither wholly awful, nor is it wholly wonderful.
However, leaving the cinema, i had an rather strange feeling that I, or maybe the film/Burton had missed the point of it somewhere along the line. (I suspect it may have been the former rather than the latter,.. but i`m not so sure...) The film looked sumptious, of course. The make up, and sets have to be seen at the cinema to fully appreciate the workmanship and realism with which it is presented etc. This was ofcourse enjoyable, as indeed you would expect in return for its budget. And yet, I was still left wondering what was the point of making it - to improve it or the idea, to make a straight forward  blockbusting action film - i suspect not. I had a sense that Tim Burton had a strong mental picture of what he wanted, but was unable to reproduce it on film, and in trying to capture it, lost it completely.
Tim Burton seems to have great warmth for the original film - there are many references to the original film (some i missed, some i got), but he does not seem to have felt an equal warmth for his own film. Much of what i have been so impressed with his previous films (with the exception of Mars Attack )- the gothic, dark and eccentric caricuturations( if there is such a word !) of, I suspect his own childhood, (Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Beetlejuice and to some extent Sleepy Hollow) and the warmth in which presents them is oddly lacking here. Only in moments do you glimpse this, and sadly for the main part of the film you are unable to distinguish the films director from that of any other director- and this is a shame, he can and has done better. He calls this film an re-imagining of the original film rather than a re-make - I am hopeful that his imagination is more fertile, and i suspect that we may see a return to his more original storytelling soon.The acting is also worth noting. Much of the this is mainstream with the majority of the cast resorting to walking around bow legged (and with ill fitting underwear no doubt) to suggest a ape like gait. Mark Wahlberg doesnt seem completely at ease with leading a film yet - either that or he isnt quite the finished article. Helen Bonham Carter plays her part well, but it is Tim Roth who steals the show, with a very powerful and eye catching performance - though, it seems to me, he stole his performance ( or copied, or was inspired ) from Michael Ironside who, bar the make-up, snarls and grunts his way round every part i have seen him do in exactly the same way - I thought it was him for large parts of the film !Dont be completely put off by this review, as this is, of course only my opinion - dont wait till it comes round on video - give it a chance and with luck you will enjoy it 6/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This is a poster child for a studio using a recognizable name to hit a release date. They were going to release this in July of 2001 no matter what, and they rushed everything along. It's possible to deliver a good movie with a constantly changing script like The Great Escape, but it's more of a recipe for a mess. Tim Burton was not given any time to figure out his vision for the film, and he just filmed, at breakneck speed, a script that didn't know what it was or what it was about.Captain Leo Davidson is a pilot on a space station orbiting Saturn who's in charge of ape pilots. When an unusual electro-magnetic storm sweeps by, they send in an ape who promptly gets lost, and then Davidson jumps into a pod without orders to try and find him. He gets hit by stuff and crash lands in a forest on a new planet. Before he can settle, he's swept up in a chase of apes looking to round up humans. By the time Davidson is in a cage, being carted off to Ape City, a grand twenty minutes have passed in the film, and that's the greatest source of the movie's problems. It just simply moves too quickly, covering everything too shallowly, and more concerned with visual spectacle than actual storytelling.On the space station, we get introduced to two humans beyond Davidson, and neither of them matter once he's off the station. On the planet, we get views of about half a dozen humans who are going to tag along with Davidson through the end of the film and they never make any sort of impression. The apes do a better job, though. There's Thade, an ape general and the chief protagonist, and Ari, the human rights loving daughter of a senator. The thing is that this movie feels like their story, but they don't get introduced until the half hour point and they are very much not the focus. Davidson never gets any sort of emotional connection to anything on this planet, insisting on just getting off as soon as possible. So, our main character is a vessel obsessed with a single object and refuses any emotional attachments, while two of our supporting characters have the actual emotional support but are so far pushed into the background that every moment feels like it comes out of nowhere.Davidson escapes, brings along his human companions and Ari, picks up the slave trader, Limbo, who had bought the humans from the military (whose only purpose seems to be picking up humans in forests), and they walk into the Forbidden Area. Meanwhile, Thade visits his father in the one scene that probably exemplifies everything wrong with this movie in microcosm.So, Thade's father is played by Charlton Heston, proving that he's a great actor even under fantastic ape makeup. In this scene, we get introduced to a character who's never been seen before and gets discarded by the end, an object of great value we've never seen before and gets destroyed by the end in what's supposed to be a great dramatic moment, and callbacks to the original movie that end up falling flat. There's no setup to anything that happens in this scene. It all just happens in quick succession, and none of it impacts with any emotion. It's a dead scene that's supposed to be full of meaning and winks to the audience that end up working against it. Much like the rest of the movie.The thing about callbacks is that they are jokey by nature. It's hard to make a callback of something extremely well known work dramatically because we all have the, ""I know that reference,"" reaction that undermines the dramatic import of the moment. So, when Attar looks down at Davidson and says, ""Take your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty human,"" the audience is chuckling instead of feeling any kind of fear. When Charlton Heston says, ""Damn them...damn them all to hell!"" we have the same kind of guffaw instead of any other emotion at the death of a character, who we haven't seen before this very scene.I'm not sure when it became de rigueur for pretty much every action/adventure movie of a certain budget to end with a battle scene against two armies, but Planet of the Apes is one of the most ridiculous of them. An army showing up out of nowhere in the minutes before the battle, flying apes with super jump abilities, and the death of side characters with dramatic feel that fall flat is how this whole thing works out. It's bizarre and it betrays the fact that no one understood where the dramatic core of this movie was.There are no ideas at play in this film. It's just a bunch of people running around for two hours without ever giving the audience any time to think about any ideas or characters or even setting.I've avoided talking about the original because this re-imagining of the idea works so poorly on its own that there's really no need for comparison, but I do think that a comparison is justified in order to help explain why the 2001 version fails so badly. Just look at the first half hour of each of them. In the original, we get a very clear idea of who our main character, Taylor, is and what he believes. We get a steady build on the setting of this new world that comes to a shock at the sight of apes riding horses. In the re-imagining, we have a bevy of characters running around talking in inanities that don't matter, special effects, and then an action scene without ever getting to know anything about our main character, Davidson, other than that he loves his ape and wants to get it back. It's thin at its absolute best, and that's not very good.This was Tim Burton's lowest point, but because of studio pressure on the production timeline, it could be excused to a certain extent. However, he went on to make Alice in Wonderland, so we all know that he had further depths to explore. This is a prime example of how not to reboot a moribund franchise. But, the ape makeup is absolutely fantastic, the movie looks pretty good most of the time, and this might be my favorite Danny Elfman score. So, it has that going for it.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Gather several hundred film addicts together for the surprise movie of the festival and expecting the same reception is a bit much (especially when they could see it at half the price the next day when it went on general release). The costumes are very good: technology and makeup has come a long way since the first cult movie classic of the same name. Unfortunately script seems to have gone backwards. The movie starts promisingly enough with a space station time-slip introduction. But having gone to enormous lengths to create the situation and life-like apes, the whole thing is ruined by resting on awful dialogue and corny 20th century jokes that are guaranteed to avert any suspension of disbelief. These super-intelligent apes toy with humans that they capture and one can't help feeling the filmmaker is toying with the audience too. One is reminded of Director Tim Burton's reputed comment that he only wanted to make movies in order to make money. If he has shown great originality and creativity in recent films to suggest he didn't mean that, this film, on the other hand, simply looks like little more than one narrow filmmaker's dream come true again . . .","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"","","not as good as the original","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512375/?ref_=tt_urv","kirlo","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1314331/?ref_=tt_urv","17 August 2001","The `reimagined' version of this story pays due homage to the 1968 classic (at the time of its release the biggest sci-fi film yet made) while retaining Burton's unique flavor and comic book atmosphere.  But comparing this to the original is like comparing Li'l Debbie snacks to Hostess-a little more style but a lot less tasty saturated fat.  Wahlberg stars as Air Force cadet Leo Davidson, stranded on a strange planet after flying recklessly into a cosmic anomaly (I believe the proper sci-fi CYA term is `a rift in the space-time continuum').  After Davidson finds the planet ruled by simians who keep humans as slaves he escapes from their clutches, finds a few sympathetic monkeys, and sets off across the country to find his ship and get back home.  The group runs into a little trouble finding any crewmates, but what they do find is the truth behind the planet's origins in a finale not nearly as fun or coherent as the original film's surprise ending.Putting plot issues aside for a moment, what you'll like about the film are the ape actors.  Tim Roth hams it up wonderfully as the ruthless ape leader Thade, even if his performance leans a little too heavily on the snarl and glare department.  Helena Bonham Carter is bewitching as Ari, an upper-class liberal ape who even manages to flirt convincingly with Davidson on their journey together. Paul Giamatti is actually funny as the orangutan slave-trader Limbo, rather than the usual obnoxious comic relief fare.  And Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa are excellent as Attar and Krull, two old war comrades who have now found themselves on opposite sides of the battlefield.  Unfortunately, the human counterparts in the film are much less impressive.  Kris Kristofferson steps in and out, stopping briefly to perhaps pick up his paycheck.  Estella Warren may as well not be there at all as her role seems to be defined as merely a pretty face among monkeys. But the most disappointing role by far is Wahlberg's, who in the past has been at least charming, but remains wooden throughout this feature.  For someone billed as the hero it's a bit off-putting that his entire focus remains on getting back to earth-in the end he spends about two minutes being noble before blundering off into the weakest `shock ending' I've seen in a film since Fight Club.But even with feeble lead performances and plot holes bigger than a baboons hot red ass we still get a few kicks out of the story.  Burton also isn't afraid to pull a couple of one-liners coupled with a Charlton Heston cameo that will set fans of the original laughing out loud in the theater.  And while POTA 2001 is not going to impress any die-hard fans of the first version, this might not be a problem-chances are, many of the young audiences watching today (sadly) never got around to seeing the forerunner for comparison.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

From there, he tries to organize a resistance and create conditions to return to his ship and travel back to Earth. That is, Burton didn't know how to use his famous creativity to show us something new. This story is almost entirely something we have already seen and read (if we consider the origin of everything, Pierre Boulle's book), dressed in new clothes, more modern or different. The work of the actors is generally acceptable, with Marc Wahlberg standing out with the main role, followed by Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth. The human characters are downright poor and main character's love interest attempts always seem out of context. Overall, it's a movie good enough to be seen but not enough to be remembered.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Clearly, the creators of this fill were more worried about how to grunt, look, and walk like an ape, than in conveying a story.   The dialog is, for the most part, grunts on the part of the apes, and practically non-existent on the part of the humans, with the exception of the lead (male) character.   The lead female character has perhaps no more than 3 or 4 lines during the entire movie.As for the story, its ridiculous and unbelievable.  Yes, yes, I know -- we're talking about a sci-fi movie where apes rule the world -- how realistic can it be?   My answer is this: when we see a movie, we allow the writers/directories to withdraw a certain amount of fantasy from our fantasy bank account.   Subsequent withdraws are at the cost of the movies believability.  Continual withdraws, as this movie does, have us thinking the writers are idiots and the movie ridiculous.   In the case of Plant of the Apes, this couldn't be any more the case.Rating:  1 out of 10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The original 1968 film was heavy on themes of social tension, the hierarchy of class systems, and evolution. In my opinion, there is no need to improve on the first film simply because there was no room for improvement. It seems that this film is designed for popcorn summer entertainment and it does not sell short of this intention. Tim Burton's dark vision is one of the strongest directorial forces of all time. Whether it's the dark comedic tone of ""Beetlejuice"" or the ethereal romanticism of ""Edward Scissorhands"", the man is genius and ""Planet of the Apes 2001"" is no exception. I do forgive him for ""Mars Attacks"" though.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The people who were expecting the original planet of the apes are idiots.  The original, though it had its strong points dragged on to long.  The extended walking in the desert scenes were just silly.  And for all these people are hanging onto, it is still just a B-movie. Tim Burtons version, which is exactly that, is tim burtons version.  It is pretty silly to compare it because the whole entire movie was reworked. But people forget the whole entire original book was reworked to have some commentary on racism and nuclear war in the original movie.  But back to the point.  I went in this movie expecting burton to deviate, even hoping. That is exactly what happened, burton reworked everything.  Thank GOD.  (no offense, but the original is a pretensious, seriously flawed, sixties, B Sci Fi movie, that has alot of inconsistancies to it, but it is probably the funniest movies I know of, because of all those reasons) Let me put it this way, this is a film that burton did for fincial reasons, mainly to fund his pet projects(Ed Wood the most notable). I was not expecting greatness, i was not expecting this to be sleepy hollow or ed wood.  I was expecting this to be a b-movie.  The acting was bad, but who cares, all acting in action movies is bad, the exception being batman, where jack nickolson brought it to a whole new level.  That and i did not think burton wanted good acting, or he would have cast his regulars.  Tim burton saw this movie as an opportunity to indulge in the b-movie genre, and make a bundle(which he will).  It was not supposed to be high art, just a fun sci-fi movie, and it would be foolish to expect anything else.Visually the movie is not so trademarky burton, but his touch is there. Yeah some of the battle scenes are silly, and in fact there are alot of inconsistancies.  But who cares.  The movie moved along very well, though a bit to fast at times.  The movie alone is worth seeing for the charlton heston apperance, which is possibly, and probably intentionally on burtons part, the funniest scene in the movie.   So go see it, but do not expect a masterpiece, or a loyal remake of the original(which never was a masterpiece).","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The performances by those wearing it is phenomenal.  Tim Roth may be one of the most engaging FX aided villains ever as General Thade.  The story isn't too complicated, nor is it nonexistant as we have come to expect from this summer's crop.  It lacks the predictability that makes so many FX laden movies fall on their face.

Only gripe is the casting of Mark Wahlberg.  He can usually turn in an engaging performance, but he's no Charlton Heston.  The ending is a mind blower, but teeters on a little too confusing.

"","","An Uneven Remake","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512629/?ref_=tt_urv","The Analytical Critic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1371413/?ref_=tt_urv","22 October 2001","`Planet of the Apes' is one those movies in which you can virtually see the downward slope from beginning to end. After a supremely evocative score by Danny Elfman, an introduction that grabs the audience, masterful atmospheric cinematography and a presentation of the premise that maintains our interest, the movie goes downhill. Essentially, the second part of the movie is little more than a cat and mouse story and does not match the expectations set up in the first part The movie has some great make-up effects, and the special effects in which the apes jump or throw others up in the air are very entertaining to watch. It seems that Tim Burton has a `signature' special effect in each of his movies: In `Sleepy Hollow' it was the decapitations, and in `Batman', the flying sequences over Gotham City. I heard many voice comments that they were disappointed by the movie. I believe that's partly because of a mismatch between its main body and the ending: up to the ending, the movie treats the subject matter as a science fiction story with only a touch of social commentary, whereas the ending is very much in the spirit of Pierre Boulle's biting social satire.  If the two elements had been better integrated, the ending might not have seemed as abrupt. The movie does deserve credit in that it did not attempt to replicate the well-known ending of the original story, but find its own twist. Nevertheless, as a social fable it is weaker than the original. I still recommend this movie because, despite the drop in the second half, it is entertaining and the cinematography and special effects are well worth watching.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I watched it a week before Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes and I am completely baffled by a lot of things in this movie.Positives for Planet of the Apes (2001):
The Apes make-up effects by Rock Baker are phenomenal and it's the one effect of this remake that is better than the original. That's it for positives.Negatives for Planet of the Apes (2001):
The fact this movie was directed by Tim Burton is baffling, because it doesn't feel or look like a Tim Burton Movie. Mark Wahlberg as Leo Davidson is one of the most boring protagonists I've ever seen in a movie. Tim Roth as General Thade is intimidating at times, but he acts overacts too much in the movie. Also, the Apes jumping 30 feets in the air is way too goofy. Finally, the ending to this movie is the worst endings I've ever seen in any movie. There is nothing about this ending that makes any logical sense whatsoever.Overall, Planet of the Apes (2001) is a remake that didn't have much going for it to begin with, but it's completely destroyed by have the absolute worst movie ending I've ever seen in my life.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

(I remain in the lobby until the film begins.) I walk into the theatre with a clean slate. I sit down wanting to be entertained and for about two hours my imagination should flow. With Planet of the Apes this is what I saw. 1) A beginning credit sequence? On a summer movie? 'Take it easy,' I said, 'you're just anxious for it to begin'. 2)After the credit sequence concludes we see a space station. A title appears stating that it's 2029, a mere 28 years from now. I squirm, the future date should have been left to my imagination 2)On the space station we see Mark Wahlberg interacting with his comrades. Nameless, numberless comrades. It dawns on me that Wahlberg maybe the only major lead. 'Oh no, he's good but he's not that good.' 3)After a monkey is shot out into the unknown in a space probe, Wahlberg, who was against this idea, straps himself in a pod of his own and states, ""Don't send a monkey to do a man's job."" My heart sinks. 4)Wahlberg crashes into a very fake looking sound stage jungle set. I'm instantly taken out of the movie. 5)But then I perk up when the apes appear. They jump through the air and leap through the trees with wreckless abandon just like I hope monkeys do. I like this. 6)Upon his capture Wahlberg grabs onto an apes legs. The ape responds with a knowing wink, ""Get your stinking hands off me, you damn dirty human!"" I'm out of the movie again. 7)The apes and their captives arrive to another claustrophobic sound stage which they warmly know as their city. 8)Darn near every shot is a close up further inducing my claustrophobia. My best defense is to fall asleep. 9)I wake up sometime later. It turns out that the apes are afraid of water so to get away from them Wahlberg suggest to his merry crew to cross the river. Ari, the friendly she-ape is afraid. Wahlberg says, 'Don't be afraid you silly nit, we'll be on horses and horses are good swimmers.' She submits and they proceed to cross the five feet deep river. Question: When the apes see the horses safely swimming to the other side why don't they follow? 10)We discover along with the main characters that Wahlberg's space station passed through the same time warp he did but crash landed 3,000 years before and that, presumedly, the smart little monkeys aboard went crazy and killed all the humans. And then I take it they evolved into the warlike big apes we now see. In only 3,000 years of evolution??? 11)As for the trick ending that everyone has now heard about. Can someone please tell me because I fell asleep again. I'd like to state for the record that I loved Starship Troopers.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As I am a fan of the original, 1968, movie, I was excited when I heard they were doing a re-telling. I thought that with today's effects technology, and a story idea as compelling as Planet of the Apes, I thought there was no way this could fail. But boy was I wrong. There is utterly no character development aside from pointing out to us who are the villains and who are the heroes. There was no motivation for General Thade's (Tim Roth) hatred or Ari's (Helena Bonham Carter) great compassion. To call the plot shallow would be to imply that there was any substance at all. And all the inside jokes concerning the original series got old, too. However, nice touch having Charlton Heston appear in a cameo as General Thade's dying father. Mark Wahlberg, who has consistently turned in very good performances in films like ""The Perfect Storm"" and ""Fear,"" falls flat with a one-note character stolen from the pages of a comic book.Sure, the effects were great and the costumes were superb, but no matter how much make-up they pancaked onto my grandfather at his funeral, he was still lifeless, as was this film. All in all, a disappointment; no drama, no suspense, no depth of plot. Just another forgettable action film.

It is pretty much a straight forward remake of the 1968 sci-fi classic as opposed to the recent Andy Serkis fronted reboots which takes the premise in a different way. There are pretty good moments including the opening titles which are delightfully scored by Danny Elfman, making us feel we are certainly in Burton's take of this world. Tim Roth is very good as General Thade; a sadistic warrior ape who is frighteningly murderous and untrustworthy. Roth has a lot of fun with the role and does provide the films standout moment towards the end, delving into the scary energy that chimpanzees can have. The classic twist ending is effectively done and a good homage to the original. Paul Giamatti is also pretty good as the comic relief of the film and it's a helluva role! The production was documented as pretty troubled. As soon as Tim was recruited to direct, there was already a release date a year away as the studio were desperate to start the franchise up again. Script rewrites were being done while sets were being made just weeks before shooting began. Under immense studio pressure, the shoot sounded stressful and tight with editing having to take place in conjunction with the shooting. All the while undergoing personal issues, it's no wonder that the film unfortunately doesn't fully stand up on its own. It's no fault of any crew or cast member who do give it their all; it's just circumstance and bad timing culminating in a rushed and churned out Hollywood flick. There's a certain charm however to seeing Rick Baker's ape make-up work which is a nice homage to the original while also embellishing on their more animalistic mannerisms. It also marks the first collaboration with Helena Bonham Carter who has started a family with Burton since and went on to star in all of his films throughout the '00s","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

What's the reason for making remakes of the classic movies that fitted well? Some remakes get to show a different side of view like Martin Scorsese's Cape Fear in 1991 where rather than showing a happy family in peril (like in the original 1962 classic), Scorsese shows a dysfunctional family filled with anger and a disease where it made audience applaud for De Niro's character.Tim Burton is known for making movies in a goth emblem from Beetlejuice, Batman Returns (the best of his work), Sleepy Hollow, Edward Scissorhands and much more. Now he directs this 1960's classic about how a man from space gets stuck in an island filled with talking and vicious primates. Mark Whalberg is Capt. Leo Davidson who doesn't do much except try to wow women with his boyish good looks where one of his lab chimps goes inside a space rocket and leaves the space station where he goes into another planet. Leo tries to find his pet until he realizes that once he arrives everything is upside down with humans in cages and use for enslavement while primates (Gorillas, monkeys, orangutans, etc.) rule the planet. The leader is General Thade (Tim Roth, who stands out) who wants to abolish all humans from the face of the earth. His henchmen involves the volatile Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan), Limbo (Paul Giamatti) the fool, and sweet Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) who crushes on Captain Leo.If you seen the original movie about how the humans and some of the chimps fight off the bad primates, there's a twist in the ending. There's no enthrallment, no cheers, it felt as if certain scenes from the trailer worked rather than the film itself while breathing in relief after I walked out of the theater.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The Planet of the Apes remake is no where need as good as the original film. It was filmed by Tim Burton, but he really was just a gun-for-hire, a film that was not made with his usual Gothic style.Planet of the Apes is set in 2029, and focuses on Leo (Mark Walberg), a US air force pilot based on a space station. On the station the air force use apes to help do tasks and pilot small pods. A wormhole opens and one of the apes is sent to investigate. When it seems that the chimpanzee was in trouble Leo follows the apes through the wormhole. After going through it Leo crash-lands in a strange jungle and encounters humanized-apes. He is captured with other humans and sold to slavery. Leo is brought by a human-sympathiser, Ari (Helena Botham Carter), and with other humans escape from the city. This leads to them getting chased by the ape army, led by General Thade (Tim Roth).As I say, the make-up by Rick Baker was very good and truly Oscar-worthy. The special-effects were good, and there was some good action scenes. However the film was lackluster and really a by-the-numbers affair. There was a poor script with this film, and the story telling was nothing like the original film. There was nothing deep about this film and just shows apes as evil and humans as good. In the original film humans were neutral and all except Charlton Heston were mute whilst the apes were more of a mixed-bag. The original Planet of the Apes was seen at time as a satire, for example the backwards issue of not teaching the theory of evolution. In this film the idea of religion was decent, but could have been more. The remake was really just a chase movie. The acting for the apes was good and well casted. Helena Botham Carter is always good and Tim Roth loved playing the evil general. Michael Clarke Duncan was also decent in it. However, the human actors were not so well-developed and this film was not Walberg's finest hour. I also didn't like Paul Giamatti as an Oranga-tan slave trader, he was only in the film to add comic relief. The other major problem with this film was the ending. The original had a great ending which everyone should know. This film's ending was sub-par. I did not like how the battle ended and the aftermath of the battle (similar to my opinions to X-Men 3). Everyone has also criticised the plot-twist at the end.I admit, when I was younger I did enjoy the film from an action-adventure viewpoint; but even then I did not like the plot twist. However, this film does have it fans like Mark Kermode and Richard Roeper.One to miss in my opinion.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Man, was I disappointed. I don't want to spoil the ending, but the original film had the best ending I've ever seen. When Tim Burton was the director, I was sure he would find something just as good or even better. He didn't.The film is one long fightscene and the actors smell bad. It isn't very realistic either. Especially when you find out that the apes learned english from Americans. I mean, if that's how they learned it, how can Helena B. Carter speak with british accent all way through?It appears that the actors must've chosen this script because it was a remake of a classic film-history film. And because of the directors name. Tim Roth is wasting his talent. Why won't anybody give him a charater as a major bad guy in a human-film? If he hadn't been hiden behind a stupid mask I'm sure he would've stole the picture from a (once again) poor performing Mark Walberg.If you like lots of action and nothing ells, I'll give this one 9 out of 10.In my own book it gets 3, from the fact of Charlton Heston being in a cameo!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I respect his work because he dares to leave his imagination free, in an arty yet commercial way. I always enjoyed his movies, but after continuously watching them for many years now (especially since they were released on DVD), I can finally spot their weakness.You see, some annoying feelings come to surface when you watch 'Batman' or 'Sleepy Hollow' for a tenth time. They are boring movies! Or to be fair, the are movies with long, boring scenes. Evidently Tim Burton seems to fear and respect every frame he shoots while editing and this behaviour creates very long dialog scenes, that work against the pacing of the movie.Long dialog scenes that don't provide exposition should be cut in a non-drama movie. Let's face it, Tim Burton has never worked with a 'Taxi Driver' script, so most of the long dialog scenes should be divided among action scenes.Also, the suspense doesn't change much in his movies. 'Sleepy Hollow' runs in the same way from start to finish, so does 'Batman'. I must say that his best work, is his comedies and maybe he should try to transfer the mood of those films to his other work too.'Planet of the Apes' is bad and I'm not talking about the ENDING, which is the best part of the movie. Only a moron would try to analyse what really happened there. Have you noticed that stupid people, always need to lower every situation to their own standards, in order to understand it? Of course this creates even more confusion (to them) and they won't get this ending no matter what, so let's proceed. By the way, true cinema is about expressing emotions and not opinions. If you need to state an opinion, the printed word is the perfect medium for it.The biggest mistake of the movie is this Burton element. 'Planet' needed aggressive editing, in order to become fun and not boring, which is what it is now. Specifically the dinner scene and the escape scene in the village. Burton treated this script like it was 'Godfather', so we watch the apes discuss over dinner about every day and social matters for ten minutes, like we care. They're talking apes! On with the story please! Obviously they wanted to balance the action with some drama scenes, but the writing is very bad. A lot of other scenes are boring too and should be deleted, since they destroy everything. Burton seems to have lost his humor in this movie too, since these long scenes could work if they were funny, but they are merely irritating.Unfortunately the script is quite weak, so even if that editing took place, it wouldn't make a masterpiece out of the story. Mark Wahlberg looks like a little kid in the whole movie, possibly because of Burton. He wanted him to become this anti Charlot Heston, an action hero who's in the movie only for the fun ride. It just doesn't work.On the positive side, Burton shows off his craftsmanship for one more time, providing us with some fairy tale images and an introduction in a space station, which is the most spectacular cinematic work since 'Superman'.'Planet of the Apes' shouldn't be made at all. How can you recreate perfection? What's next, a remake of 'Lawrence of Arabia'? Anyway, for once more Burton made an action movie that doesn't stand the test of repetitive viewings and this is because of his fear for aggressive editing.4/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I agree with the earlier comments rating this as mediocre and illogical at every turn (within the bounds of the fantastic premise of course.)  I haven't read most of the 1238! comments but don't see any bringing up an aspect which jumped out at me.  __  To digress, I was stunned to see that, when the film Ghost Busters was turned into a tv cartoon series, Aykroyd's & Murray's characters were transferred not unlike the originals but Ernie Hudson, the one black ghost buster, was replaced by an ape!  Planet of the Apes strikes me the same way.  __  I'm white and do not presume to speak for blacks but I cannot see how this movie, with only one token black human surrounded by otherwise entirely white humanity, can avoid coming off as comparing blacks to simians.  Yes, I realize that this flick is presenting a lame, elementary-school-level case for liberalism.  I do not however see that as negating the fact that, while the film repeatedly instructs us that slavery is bad and that intolerance is bad, the humans are basically purely white, which means that the other set of characters (the apes) must represent blacks.  __  A weak claim is made that humans enslaved apes and now, after turnabout, apes have enslaved humans.  The problem with that is that humans do not use apes as slaves.  Hmm, who did whites used to enslave if not apes?  Blacks.  So then, if this society represents a reversal of our own, who must the apes represent?  Blacks.  __  Other fantasy films successfully make the desired point by either having characters of different colors or races on both sides, thus pointing out that intolerance is not inherently caused by racial difference, or by having characters with cultural differences which in no way resemble actual ethnic or racial groups.  I am in no way saying that the apes in this film resemble actual blacks but I am saying that some of the characteristics (besides their ability to ignore the laws of physics) they exhibit are exactly how bigots used to make fun of blacks.  __  Am I the only one here who was alive before the civil rights movement and thus what I'm talking about is totally foreign to the rest of your experiences?  Please explain to me how I am reading things wrong, if I am.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In fact, one reviewer gives a completely false description of how ape civilization started which makes me think he hasn't even seen the movie, but is only spreading bad hype. Folks, maybe you haven't seen some of the other movies that came out this year, but compared to the likes of ""Mummy Returns"", ""JPIII"", ""Swordfish"" etc., Tim Burton's POTA is a modern-day ""Citizen Kane"".I understand people don't like to see their favorite movie remade, but that's no reason to diss this movie. Besides, it's not a remake, it's a re-imaging.The original movie was a social commentary. The new POTA is a sci-fi action summer movie, and I don't see anything wrong with that especially if it's done the way Tim Burton did it. Racial inequality and fear of nuclear annihilation don't plague the world as much as they did in 1968. The story line is basically same.The acting is top-notch as opposed to the original's melodramatic and sometimes over-the-top acting. Mark Wahlberg gives a subtle and understated performance. Paul Giamatti provides great comic relief. And can you say Academy Award Nominee for Tim Roth and Helena Bonham-Carter. There are a lot of complaints about bad dialog. I must have overheard it, because I don't remember any cheesy or nonsense lines.The ending was fascinating. In two years, no other movie, besides Memento, made me think about it as much. The makeup and cinematography are absolutely amazing, as is the kick-ass score. I see how someone could get frustrated with the ending, because it makes you make use of those damn brain cells. Tim Burton used the original novel's ending, so when you trash the ending, you also trash a sci-fi classic.So don't listen to all the bad hype. Go see the movie and make up your own mind.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Do they screen movies like this and pat each other on the back, hand the director a cigar and crawl off to bed thinking how incredible smart they all are? Or is it that halfway through production, it all begins to fall apart and money already spent cannot be recovered and the project becomes a salvage effort. The balloon ego of an overrated director is pricked, and although he must still put his signature to it, decides to punish the studio for its blindness to his genius vision, by handing them a bomb that they all hope people wont recognizes. Who knows, I actually believe that while movies in the past have been miscast, this is an example of a movie having been misdirected. Burton's world creation just doesnt work here. Its completely claustrophobic, and unrealistic. Contrast to the original classic, which utilized all open panoramic scenery that was disturbingly too realistic. Burton creates a Gilligans island atmosphere, and coupled with the horrible story - you get a bad bad movie. So lets recap, you have a good book to work with, a great original movie to study, and the end result is this piece of junk that ignores both. Again, its not Burtons fault. He is a one trick pony, and some of his movies are great.

We start off with an electrical storm in space that results in some serious time travel, just like we saw in Lost In Space, which results in our hero winding up thousands of years in the future and on an unknown planet. Seconds after surviving the crash landing of his pod on this mysterious planet, Leo Davidson (Mark Walhberg) finds himself surrounded by fleeing HUMANS. The first thing I thought was that there are humans and apes on an unknown planet in an unknown galaxy roughly 5000 years in the future, but later we learn (also as seen in Lost In Space) that Leo's ship also passed through that time warp and landed in the same place, leaving the humans to go into submission to the out-of-control apes that were on the ship for experimentation, and the apes themselves were left to evolve and take control, ultimately turning into the hard-nosed apes that ruled the planet when Leo crash landed. That was a mouthful. Pretty creative though, once we are eventually informed as to what the hell is going on. So Leo is stuck on this planet where the roles are basically reversed and exaggerated between humans and apes, and now it is entirely up to Leo to save this planet's version of the human race from the oppression of the apes. Tim Roth delivers a horribly annoying performance as General Thade, the militant leader of the apes who is so filled with hatred for the humans (for reasons never made entirely clear) that he operates just like a machine. He's always grunting and growling and always has his head tilted downward like he's expecting physical confrontation at all times, and his constant guttural tone of voice makes him almost amusing after a while. One of the biggest problems with this movie is that the apes are so well made up, but they also have tremendous intelligence, as is made evident by their strikingly human eyes, and yet they switch back and forth from normal speech to the same screeching and screaming that you hear from the monkeys at the zoo. There is a scene where General Thade is told that the humans crossed the river using the apes' own horses, and he jumps all around the place, screeching and jumping and breaking things, and then he's back on the ground talking like a warrior. It's so hard to take this stuff seriously.Helena Bonham Carter is excellent as Ari, the weirdly attractive ape who is disgruntled with the way that the humans are treated by the apes, and who turns against her own kind to help the humans escape. There is a childish scene at the end of the film where Leo kisses Ari that is sure to get a laugh from any audience, while the stunningly but almost weirdly beautiful Estella Warren provides the human love interest. It's a good thing that they had a human woman in this movie to take romantic interest in Leo, because without her we only have Ari, who is 100% ape but who acts exactly like a human woman while interacting with Leo. For the first half of the film, I was a little nervous about the possibility of a little bestiality happening somewhere in there. So we know that Ari is helping the humans because she is disillusioned with her violent species, but they are also accompanied by another ape - Attar, I think (hey, half the fun was trying to figure out who was underneath all that make-up, right?) - and we never know why he agrees to go along, knowing that he will face severe punishment upon returning, which is one of the movies more simplistic but peeving oversights. It is, however, the ending of the film that ruins it beyond all hope for being saved.
At the beginning of the film, when Leo took off in the pod toward the electrical storm, he was going after the pod of his chimp, with whom all communication had been lost. He gets swept away in the same electrical storm as the chimp got caught in, and winds up on the planet described above. At the end of the film, the chimp comes through right in the middle of the climactic battle between the humans and the apes, and the apes bow down to him as their god. This was actually a pretty clever scene, because he was, in fact, one of the first apes of their civilization, and then Leo trades places with him, leaving him with Ari (and with an obviously broken leg, which we're left to assume turned out okay) and taking the ship back to his own time. And General Thade, I guess, was just left sulking under that console on the ship forever, doomed to live the rest of his life as a loose end in a sub-par sci fi movie. It was bad enough that everything on the ship still worked after thousands of years, now they have to leave stuff everywhere unexplained.So we get back to Earth, Leo survives the entrance through the atmosphere and then miraculously survives another violent crash landing without a scratch, and he finds the Lincoln Monument is an ape (when I saw Lincoln from behind, I jokingly said to myself that it would be an ape. I was disappointed and amused to find that I was right). This could, of course, mean only one thing. Seeing how there was barely an explanation for the English speaking humans and apes on the planet on which most of the film took place, and there was literally none at all given for the apes replacing the humans on Earth, we can only assume that they ran out of money or they are just setting up for a sequel. My money is on the latter. Stay tuned for part 9 (or so).","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I mean does every movie have to show the dumb trailers that either show you every laughable line or worse yet, show you a synopsis of the whole movie??? I think a simple teaser would suffice for any and all movies before they are released. Unless we are all turning into little children as adults and need the whole movie pratically explained to us before going to go see it.Anyway, this was a very good version of POTA. I was very pleased and a little surprised at the outcome of the movies ending. They practically gave it away, probably for the slower people who like long trailers.This is very much worth seeing and I hope they get the sequel done by next year. They better not leave this one hanging too long. They never made people wait too long in the past series.Thanks, Gary","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"","","Generally weak redo leaving behind all the important plot elements of the original","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512546/?ref_=tt_urv","jarredcinman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1339020/?ref_=tt_urv","3 September 2001","Redoing a well-known, landmark movie is always, one would imagine, a challenge. Where the original depended so heavily on a surprise ending for its overall impact, the task is heightened to daunting. One would say, perhaps, even impossible.Tim Burton -- whose directing credits include films such as Batman, Beetlejuice and Nightmare Before Christmas -- was always going to produce the goods when it came to dark sets, evil villians and eye-popping special effects. So while he doesn't disappoint there, that alone is not enough.The major problem with this film is the atrocious plot, which is so unlike the original this film can hardly be termed a remake. The screenwriters have changed just about all the important plot elements, characters and events. This perhaps was a necessity, and possibly the only way to approach this task, but it is at the same time unfortunate. Everything in the film seems like an ""alternative"", an idea that may have been dropped in favour of the real thing the first time around.The film suffers from a profound lack of character development, and a 'flatness' of emotion which alienates the audience. Where a Jurassic Park or Star Wars Episode I focus on the special effects to the detriment of character and plot, this film takes this error to its extreme. We are, it seems, to marvel at the special effects so much as be entirely satisfied without any other elements. So much time onscreen is dedicated to celebrating the visuals of the world that Burton has created that we have no opportunity to understand it on any other level. One feels that large chunks of this film were cut and that a Director's Cut is inevitable. Perhaps that will provide the meat that this so desperately needs.To be fair to Burton, he worked with the screenplay he was given, and it is in this that most of the problem lies. The performances are generally good -- although Wahlberg is terrible as the hero -- and Tim Roth is excellent. Perhaps like Batman, Roth is this film's Nicholson, and makes the film worthwhile on his own.And then there's that ending. While I won't describe it for fear of robbing you of the small thrill that it provides, I will say that it is the most tangential and irrelevant ending imaginable. It literally appears to belong to a different film altogether, and is really a trite and blithe attempt to stun the audience the way the first film did. It is remarkable that any experienced director or writer could believe that simply tacking on a disconnected idea at the end of a film could provide any shock whatsoever. The result is a ""Huh?"" where there should be a ""Wow!"".Overall, Planet of the Apes fails in so many ways that remove the special effects and fine actors and a major flop would emerge. The film will no doubt be broadly watched and enjoyed for it's visual elements, but does seem to offer this lesson to all screenwriters and studios out there: if you can't think of how to possibly remake a film, and you're wracking your brains and have to think really, really hard, then please, just don't.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I like to think of myself as a Tim Burton fan. However, I feel that when he gets a big budget, his work suffers. Ed Wood was his lowest budgeted film and was by far his greatest work. ""Mars Attacks"" and this ""Ape"" movie both had big budgets and were really horrible. Someone needs to tell Hollywood, that when you revisit a classic story, bring something new to the story. Special effects alone is not enough. I believe that Hollywood thought that by just having more elaborate costumes and apes, they would have a better movie, wrong! The story was just paper thin and the script was one of the worst ever. The first hour of this film was just a bunch of campy jokes. I have never seen more uninspired performances. However, to be fair, the actors had nothing to work with. The story is just patched together. Few characters are developed or have any importance. Man, this was a bad film. However, people will consider it a smash hit, because of the box office totals. However, most of the money taken in by this film was in the first week, so the negative word of mouth had not gotten out yet. This film has dropped like a rock since week one. Let's hope that Burton can return to actually telling a story and a weird story at that. That was one thing this film was missing, there was no ""Burton Weirdness"" anywhere. Bland and boring. * out of *****.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

However, a smarter move on the part of the directors would have been to scrap the film, and screen the preview in theaters.  This film in the region of the worst film I have ever seen.  Mark Wahlberg, as usual, adds nothing to the film with his despicable acting and moronic facial expressions, except the impression that he is severely constipated; Tim Roth (who has contributed to such great films as Reservoir Dogs and Little Odessa) was physically painful to watch; and I still don't understand why they bothered to include Helena Carter in the cast at all.  It takes a flight of the imagination to imagine Tim Burton saying ""cut!"" on the set, and being pleased with what he had created.  Bottom line: DO NOT SPEND ANY MONEY ON THIS FILM.  The actors are pathetic, the new ending is as pointless as it is absurd, and Tim Burton should beat himself in the face with a frying pan for this one.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The costumes were nice and it had a scene or two that was interesting, but overall, the movie stunk.  Apes who leap 60 feet in the air, dialogue that would be better found in a WB Sitcom, and effects right out of the Saturday special on TNT, leaves the viewers less that satisfied.  I saw this movie on opening night and when the credits ran, a few of the patrons applauded.  Nothing new for opening night, but when people began to boo and hurl leftover popcorn at those who were clapping...that was new and more entertaining than the movie.Burton made many blunders with this one, oh it had such potential.  Estella Warren's only function in the movie was to be a trophy wife, I think she had all of 2 1/2 lines to deliver.  Marky Mark Wallberg was less than stellar and his character is one that you will root for the crazed apes to kill. Only Tim Roth and Michael Clarke Duncan made this movie worth watching. While Roth's character (General Slade) leaps around like a frog, he is a good villain and Duncan's character (Attar) is enjoyable to watch.Overall, you would be better served to watch ""The Mummy"" all over again, as you will get the same thrills, better acting, and, can you believe it, a better story line.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What I missed the most was the scientific approach that the original had. Showing why the apes' beliefs were covered in lies and why humans actually were intelligent.In this Tim Burton movie it seems he has to add the violence and fighting needed to get the big movie producing budget from 20th Century Fox.In one sequence Leo (played by Mark Wahlberg) points a gun at an ape, but is told to not sink to his level (the ape was a trader-in-humans) by Ari (magnificently played by Helena Bonham-Carter). Yet in the end there is no problem to fight the Ape army in Braveheart-style.The whole magic usually included in Tim Burton movies is never there, and somehow he falls for the blockbuster-syndrome: a cool action-hero and a lot of incredible stunts.And the ending, without spoiling anything, must be the worst ever displayed on the screens.However, the costumes and make-ups are incredible, but they are in line with modern movie-technology. They could give one or two Academy Awards next year. But I don't understand why apes covered in body-hair/fur would want to wear clothing or uniforms. Overall, the great performances by Helena Bonham-Carter as a Senators daughter and revolting youth preaching humanism and equality and Tim Roth as the dangerous and evil general Thade makes this movie a pretty good entertainment and raising the Rating to 5/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The make-up is astounding, and Mark proves to be a pretty good no-brain action star. Tim Roths is a pretty good monkey-gone-bad, but as I said before, this movies too silly to be taken seriously and his intense performance is kind of lost.After it's revealed how the monkeys got the way they were, (and why their english was so good) the plot just get's silly and builds up too a fairly laughable ending.

In this day and age people want to criticize the reality of everything and the filmmakers(and TV producers) see that as a challenge. This fact makes Planet of the Apes(2001) fail. I admit that after finding out Tim Burton and Danny Elfman (both of whom I am a gigantic fan) were on board I got very excited. I believed it might be done properly. I knew it couldn't be done but still got suckered in. After seeing it I realised that what I knew all along really was true. The costumes and makeup were perfect and so were the sets but there is no denying that this movie falls flat where the other made it's mark - the ending. They did pretty good with the story by putting a whole new twist on the origin of the Planet of the Apes, but in the end it all turned sour. When I first watched the original I thought of how they were going to end it and there was a certain ending that I (and many others) thought of that would make the movie stupid and very cliche. Thank god they didn't do it and instead made history. Unfortunately the new version of this movie has the EXACT twist ending we were afraid of seeing in the original. Very stupid, very easy and worst of all VERY unimaginative. I was actually cringing in my seat hoping they wouldn't end it the way they did. All I can say is ""Bummer"".","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Yes...A Remake! (& a Poor One at That)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512765/?ref_=tt_urv","jbirtel","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1781729/?ref_=tt_urv","5 January 2003","The difference is this; the makers took a little from all 5 prior Ape films, plus the TV series. Any reference to the original novel is non-existent.All that hard work recreating the (improved?) makeup has come to naught when the movie doesn't ride on a good script. At least the 1968 original took its time to pace the story properly to create some sort of suspense. The 2001 remake jumps from one scenario to the next in episodic fashion that leaves no room for the viewer to really care what happens to anyone. And except for the last half hour, you never get the feeling that you're out in the open air. Everything feels claustrophobic; like being on an over crowded sound stage.I still appreciate many of Burton's other films, but this is a misfire with too many cliches that most of us have seen before. And it seems that so much time was taken with the makeup; so much time was taken with paying visual homage to the original and its sequels; that they forgot to let a proper narrative flow take over the story and at least include a LITTLE logic (and I'm not even referring to the ending). The homages? 'Ari'...spell it backwards and put a 'Z' in front. Any more, I'd rather not spoil...you might have fun spotting them on your own when referencing 'Planet..', 'Beneath..', Escape..', 'Conquest..' and 'Battle..' (and the short lived TV series and cartoon).Stick with the original...as long as it is in wide screen (the pan & scan sucks to the point that you miss half the movie, especially when there are characters and events taking place on both ends of the wide screen).Perhaps the writers should have spent a little less effort calling this a 're-imagination' and instead used some 'real imagination' to create a compelling staple in the sci-fi genre that this deserved.5 out of 10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Director Tim Burton wasted no expense or effort to make this a visual feast. Too bad he didn't put the same effort into creating a terrific story, especially since there was so much potential to work with. The 1968 original is considered a Sci-Fi classic, not just because of the story, but also the issues it dealt with. It used a society where apes are the top species to comment on and satirize our own society. There are moments of this in ""Apes 2001"", but mostly it's another big budget action film, only with actors in monkey costumes. As proof of this, the lead character, played by Mark Wahlberg (aka Marky Mark) is just another hotshot fighter jock, meaning there's no problem he thinks he can't solve by simply blasting the bad guy to bits. Which is a shame, since it would be much more interesting to see him outwit his enemies, thus showing who really was the superior species. Also, it doesn't help that the female lead, played by Helena Bonham Carter, doesn't even remotely look like a real chimp. I guess Burton & Co. couldn't resist making her look sexy, complete with a fashionable hairstyle. So, ultimately what you have is lots of good looks, but not much in the way of brains. I'm looking forward to viewing the 1968 original, just to see how this film falls short by comparison. 5/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They left their comic book stores and went to the theater expecting a shot by shot remake of the original. Well -- suprise! -- This wasn't a remake. Tim Burton's Apes was a different story all together with a similar --more sensible-- plot.   This one, in my opinion, was better. It contained connections to not only the first few movies in the series but to the novel as well [examples being with the GREAT suprise ending or the 'fun for the whole family' monkey named Pericles - who sadly died in the book]. Also, The Special Make Up Effects to this 2001 version --when analyzed-- blew the original out of the water. Rick Baker's work to this is his best since 'an American Werewolf in London'. When you combine all of that with Danny Elfman's pounding score and Tim Burton's smooth direction you get something that hasn't been conceived since Warner Brothers' BATMAN was released.   Oh, and In regards to a few news group critics' spiteful reviews, Tim Burton's visual style is very much evident in this million dollar 'Blockbuster' movie. If you'll think back to the cold white/black contrasting space station segments or the jungle / desert shot lay-ups then you'll realize that a sort of Hitchcock reminiscent style of frame composition is present. That's pure Tim Burton. The colors and set designs are prime examples.   In my opinion, Don't you compare this one to the original, it's a great movie on it's own. It explains more than the original did --or the book-- and makes more sense, like how the apes speak English. Tim Burton hasn't done something of this calibre since his 1989 comic book film renderings. So in summation, for all of you whiny little 1960's Apes Fanatics, just think about the references this one made to the original, Think about how much better the old one could have been and think mostly about why the movie made so much money - if it was so bad? Tim Burton's a genius artist and this film was his pallet.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Director Tim Burton, so far, has started and continued a promising career as a Hollywood filmmaker. So far, his first films I saw was ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Batman"", both are well-done. Burton continued such masterpieces like the sequel ""Batman Returns"", ""Edward Scissorhands"" and the highly acclaimed ""Ed Wood"". Even his dark comedy ""Mars Attacks"", which proved a little different from his other films, is still a great funny entertainment, which was a little better than the too-serious ""Independence Day"". Besides, when it comes to Burton's different film, it can only be this, a remake of the classic adaptation of Pierre Boulle's classic ""Planet of the Apes"".Just by looking at the results of this film, I'm sure that Burton was out of place here. No matter how brilliant he is as a director, the epic genre is something he's not in to. His films are usually the bizarre, or fairy tale-like films, combined with some dark comedy and satire. ""Planet of the Apes"" has none of those. It's a full-blood epic that revolves around man battling a more intelligent species that they weren't aware that will out-evolve them. In other words, the plot for ""Planet of the Apes"" is darn serious. Burton, most usually don't take everything seriously, and likes to look at the weird side. Since this film has no room for any of those, it's easy to see a failure. The make-up effects by Rick Baker are truly superb, giving each Ape character its own different look and personality. I guess that more than makes up for the films blander human characters, say Mark Wahlberg as a bland, often unconvincing action hero. Certainly, Tim Roth as the overreacting human-hating ape Thade, Helen Bonham Carter's human-loving ape Ari and many of the other simian co-stars steal the show, providing some terrific performances while under that heavy does of make-up. It ain't Burton at his definitive best, and PLANET OF THE APES certainly doesn't end being the summer's biggest blockbuster (even JURASSIC PARK III has more to offer than this). An intriguing yet misguided disappointment. Rating: **1/2 out of 5.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The ape make up is Oscar worthy, though at most times it distracts from the already weak plot and make most dialogue incomprehensible. This film parodies the previous ""Ape"" film with several one-liners. This is not supposed to be a comedy or satire, it is a ""message"" movie on how we treat and behave towards other beings. At least that was what the novel and 1968 version was about. I think another problem was that the director did not know whether to have the apes behave like apes or humans. Dd they evolve and become human like or retain there ape behavious and just learn to speak? So many questions? Goofs? Disjointed plotlines and other errors that cannot be detailed without giving away the plot.

The movie begins with Mark Wahlberg going after his lost chimpanzee into an electrical storm in space. This electrical storm sends our hero hundreds of years into the future, where he crash lands onto the planet of the apes. I will stop with the summary here, as there are many unexpected occurences throughout the movie.The greatest part of this film, is the casting of Tim Roth as Thade, the ape general.

At least Aldo would make me smile with his terrible acting because his was probably only paid in peanuts (no pun intended) due to budget restraints.

I was never that big a fan of the original movie, finding it a goofy B movie that has seen its reputation grow in recent years much like the band Kiss.  So I did have some hope that, despite the mixed reviews, I might come down on the positive side.Early on, I sort of liked it.  I liked the way the apes acted more like apes in their movement and mannerisms, but soon I felt that it was becoming unnecessary comic relief - sort of like bad old movies poking fun at racial stereotypes.  And yes, Wahlberg is a failure in the lead role.  He seems curiously detached and his performance just sucks energy out of the movie.But Estella Warren is the tip-off here.  We have a supermodel in a skimpy outfit who serves no purpose in the film other than someone/thing to look at.  Why is she here?  I am convinced more than ever that this element, as well as others, ended up there as a result of market research and studio demands as opposed to anything resembling ""artistic vision"" by the director.From there, I can only think that we are starting to witness the downfall of Burton.  Much as Coppola went from ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" to ""Jack"" (not that I mean to say that Burton's aspirations were ever the equal of the messages that Coppola conveyed in his best work).  Any pretense of Burton as an artist or visionary is gone with this film.  He might as well direct Lethal Weapon 5 next.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Marky Mark, er, Mark Wahlberg (excuse me) all muddied up running around a Tim Burton set and B. that they were even remaking this accidental classic, which easily is near the top of America's Cheesiest Films Of All Times list (right below Blackula, Killer Tomatoes and Jon Waters' purposely cheesy farces of course).For those too young to remember, Planet of the Apes first appeared in 1968. It was a sensation with audiences and panned by critics. The costumes were state-of-the-art for the times and the sets were as other worldly as they could portray in a sixties Star Trek quazi-realism way.Those who enjoyed the first version(s) even passed up the concession stand goodies for fear of losing that comfy close-up seat. The suspense of what the apes would look with all the modern gizmos the FX folks have at their disposal nowadays was almost unbearable. Like with The Grinch's recent successful transformation into 21st century-gadget- hoopla- infused- bing- bam box-office magic, TPOA does not disappoint on that level.As for the the rest of the film? Well, the plot is as deep as Green Eggs and Ham and the ""human"" cast is about as exciting as an instructional video on an anal polyp removal from the lower bowel of a brown field mouse, yet still, mad-director Tim Burton left just enough camp to keep it, surprisingly, enjoyable.The story goes...Astronaut; Leo Davidson (Mark ""softly spoken"" Wahlberg) is aboard a space station USS Oberon, training primates to play Astronaut. One starry night he is told to send one of these Chimps out to research a menacing energy field approaching fast on their starboard side.The ""canary in the coal mine"" never returns...So, Leo, bored with his mundane duties anyhow, jumps into a delta pod to rescue the fellow, and, surprise, gets transported through time to a place ruled by...He crash lands safely in an eerie swamp. But, before he can shake his banana dry, he is over run by a group of fear-for-their-lives types ricocheting through the forest being pursued by dressed, orating, violent apes. Leo is trapped, along with these ratty anorexic -Mad Max looking- extras each with a perpetual glaze over their faces like deer locked on headlights (or Nick Cage in an emotional scene), and sent to market. The market is run by Limbo (brilliant Paul Giamatti) a sleazy Orang creep.Leo and a boopsie faced tribe gal, Deana (Estella "" be careful of bimbo typecasting  dear"" Warren), meet in one of Limbo's human slave holding cells. She's smitten, but he's focused on his personal inner dialog, his sequel, ""Exit El Quicko from the Planet Of The Apes.""They end up working together and gather a few others including, human rights activist girly ape Ari (Helena Bonham Carter). They all escape the city and head to ""rendezvous"" with Leo's space colleagues who have been sending out a signal to him via his space age transmitter he rescued from his sunken space pod. The humans hope Leo is their savior fallen from the sky to save them from the mini-Kongs that suppress them. Leo hopes his friends are waiting for him, just over the mountain rangeThe fleeing party faces some pretty mean mother-apers en route to Shangri-La! One ape in particular, General Thad, (Tim Roth) hates humans in a Hitler- southern plantation owner-circa 1800 way. He wants the filthy creatures (humans) completely annihilated and is schmoozing with the ape senate to get his wish. Leo is just what the nefarious Thad ordered when praying to their almighty Semos for a sign the humans must all go. With Leo's frightening display of intelligence and back bone, the senate will be scared bananaless into giving Thad the Marshal Law decree he so desires.
Will Leo and his new tribal friends make it to the space command center before Thad's wicked army finds and crushes them? Is Leo the god they have waited for all these years? Could the last fight scene be tackier?Don't worry, I'm not ruining anything here for you...It's so telegraphed G.W. Bush would know the ending half way through. Okay, maybe right before the credits at least.The story is a tad blasé. You may find yourself adrift about the screen, looking for something to busy your brain when Mark and crew aren't battling the Apes. Which brings up a kind of humorous point of observation, Wahlberg's ""Leo"" has like three sentences of dialog in a scene, then smacko, he's immediately in primal combat again; like an odd ballet of film you watch and keep a mental metronome swaying in your head1-2-3 fight, 1-2-3 fight.TPOA is really all about the visual treats; like watching intense thespian Tim Roth bounce about like an extra at Ringling Bros. & Barnum Bailey Circus of the Cruel in his cute little money, er, ape suit. Tim Roth's ""Thad"" was super creepy. Hate oozes from his furry little pores to the point were you feared he may really have gone rabid. Even with all the schtuffamagal Roth had burying his features, the feeling and depth from the actor beneath came through. Or Helena Bonham Carter, all made up in ten pounds of latex, a far cry from the West End beauty she is, for sure. Still a lady, even as an ape.Then there's MM Wahlberg. His picture is in Compton's Encyclopedia under ""example of the Male Homo Sapiens "" -In my version anyway The man's body is, simply, dare I say, perfect. He's a double cream serving of Pistachio Ice cream with a hidden layer of marshmallow fluff. Scrumptious. Leo was a dull character so MM's signature ""whisper"" delivery worked. I think I need a Boogie Nights fix...TPOA has quite a few exciting moments. Enough to recommend it. Those nostalgic for the original take heart- there's still only one Cornelious (Roddy McDowall) and this is not a replacement, it's just another look at a pretty wild concept , modernized for the new generation to enjoy.
An aside: Danny Elfman, Timmie Burtonski's favorite music man, is back incahoots producing the film's score. As always, Elfman delivers a catchy, flowing gently ominous orchestration of notes.Snack recommendation: Banana nut pound cake and Pistachio ice cream.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

If this film proves anything, it's that Tim Burton is one of the greatest creative minds in cinematic history.  When I saw the trailer I feared this one wouldn't be as dark as his previous efforts, but there are still plenty Burtonesque images for the fans to be happy.I saw the original Charlton Heston film and although I appreciated the camp qualities and the shock ending, it was basically nothing more then a long episode of the muppet show.  This version has so much more style and the apes are truly impressive, you forget they're just humans, unlike in the original.  Rick Baker deserves an oscar for his work. I also think Mark Whalberg makes a much more realistic hero then Heston. While Charlton was happy enough to fight 'them darn monkeys', the only thing Whalberg cares about is to get the hell out of there, with or without the other humans.

I rented the film on DVD, sat back and waiting to be disappointed.  I wasn't. Tim Burton takes the original idea and makes something new (and better?) out of it.  Fans of the original film shouldn't consider this a remake, more a homage.  Burton adds his own twists, which work well, and the ending is more than adequate (especially when you're trying to top the shock ending of the first film).  I can't believe I enjoyed it, but I did and would recommend anyone who was put off should give it a chance...","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"","","Burton's Reimagining: The Major Problems","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512468/?ref_=tt_urv","harp66","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1325171/?ref_=tt_urv","24 August 2001","Like almost every viewer of the latest ""Planet of the Apes"" who has chosen to comment on the film, I too have been disappointed by the latest version, seeing how it falls short of the freshness that Tim Burton brought to many of his films. In some respects though, I am not as harsh in my criticism as others.It is naive to compare Burton's latest film to his more offbeat successes like ""Ed Woods,"" ""Edward Scissorhands,"" and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". Those were personal projects, conceived and driven by him, not projects like the ""Batman"" films which were studio-driven and intended, first and foremost, as money machines. As such, it was highly unlikely that he would have been allowed a great deal of license. (Remember the fate of his planned version of ""Superman"" with Nicholas Cage? I'm sure Burton does.)However, Burton *can* be faulted in two places. First, the one point in the story where originality and daring might have played a role was in the Leo/Ari/Daena relationship. I wouldn't call it a love triangle--even though it was promoted as such--since Wahlberg's Leo never registers any particular emotion towards either female. Part of this must be attributed to the script which doesn't give him any lines or action to suggest attraction towards either Bonham-Carter's Ari or Estella Warren's Daena (though that a more resourceful actor could have communicated something nonverbally).Despite having Bonham-Carter display obvious interest in Wahlberg, Burton fails to follow through by having his Leo reciprocate (or at least display ambivalence about a female chimp flirting with him).
The studio's reported objections to a graphic love scene are not surprising. What *is* strange is why Burton introduced the idea and then failed to develop it. Certainly a skillful director can explore the idea of such an unusual relationship without resorting to explicit sex; but Burton just teases us with the idea and then drops it.Equally disappointing is the ending. While I will not divulge it, I think it is enough to say that it has no meaningful connection to what precedes it. A ""problematic"" ending of a film at least allows workable interpretations. Burton's ending does not. A *major* flaw in any sort of story.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie, which was very entertaining and - if I recall correctly (although it's been many years since I read it) is more consistent with the story of Pierre Bouille's original novel. So, my advice is that if you're either avoiding this or watching it because you expect it to be like the ""Apes"" movies of thirty years ago, plan to watch it on its own merits instead.The cast was in general very good. Mark Wahlberg did a fine job as the astronaut Leo Davidson, stranded on this nightmare of a planet (for him) with no obvious way of getting home. Tim Roth as his primary ape antagonist, General Thade, was also very good. I had a mixture of reactions to Helena Bonham Carter's role as Ari, the human-loving ape. Her performance was quite good, but, frankly, I found her character to be rather irritating. It's a necessary role. We have to see these divisions in ape society, but the character just didn't appeal to me in the same way as, say, Cornelius and Zera did in the original movie. I also thought the ape makeup was rather weak. Frankly, they did a better job thirty years ago.But those minor criticisms aside, I really did enjoy this movie. It was a fast-paced story that held my attention, there was enough humour to make it fun, and enough drama to make me wonder how Davidson was ever going to get out of this. And - as I said at the start - the end itself is worth watching the whole movie.I rate this as an 8/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I think that a lot of people did not enjoy this film because they tried to compare it to the original 1968 film. In truth, the stories and characters are different. Remaking the original film would not have been a good idea because most people know the ending; this film takes a different approach. The human lands on the planet, and he is taken hostage with some other humans, and together, they learn the history of the planet. In this film, however, the presence of a villain character is an important part of the film. No, this film is not as good as the 1968 one, even though they are different stories, but it is still enjoyable. The script was done well, but it was not as engaging and not as memorable. It's captivating as an action/adventure film with some science fiction elements, even though it does not go the extra way to create a true classic. Still, it's good if you're looking for something fun to watch.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Don't blink or you might miss - the plot? You didn't miss it, it really was that short.Here's a tip off for a bad script: If you see more than one name in the writing credit, WATCH OUT!There are alot of reviews of this blockbuster, so I will just ask a few questions which you could answer as you watch the film:Was Michael Clarke Duncan was the only ape that sort of looked like himself? (A nice touch that George Lucas did in the Phantom Meanace).Did you catch the meaning of CALIMA? CAution LIve ANimals, easy to miss!If the apes wanted no one to go to CALIMA, why was the it so poorly protected?If it was the center of their universe for thousands of years and so easy to reach, why were there no apes AT ALL there? Wouldn't they come to ""worship"" at least?How come Davidson all of a sudden cares about this kid? Just exactly what was the point of having him stay behind the ship? Who was the kid? What the heck was going on there?Did you care at all when Kris Kristofferson got killed? Nope!
Did you care a little when a couple of guys in Davidson's original band got iced? Only a little.What was the point (from the writer's point of few) of taking out the (cool) gun? He brought back later, anyway. With two guns, that might have been fun. One guy shooting up himself was just stupid, didn't you think?Just exactly where did all the aps and all the humans come from? I mean, seriously, would the humans live so close to the apes if they were rounding them up as pets and slaves? Give me a break! I'd have found a better neighborhood.  (On top of that, there's a little problem of genetic diversity here of there were no natural apes and humans on this planet in the first place. But, we'll give Tim poetic license on that).So, the GOD arrives, literally out of the sky in a space ship. NO ONE is scared of this technology AT ALL. They recognize this is a prophecy come true yet they have NO PROBLEM letting the UNCLEAN Davidson walk right up to their DEITY.  Then, they proceed to beat the daylights out of the diety nearly kill him.  (I guess that answers why no one was worshiping). Question: Is there a story here or not? No!Would a good alternate title be ""Crouching Humans, Hidden Monkeys?""Who exactly would have the Lincoln-esq Thade have liberated to get the statue? I think it might have been humans, don't you? So, maybe Davidson didn't do as bad as is implied. (But, now, it looks as if he should have stuffed the girl into the capsule with him, eh?)How did this movie get made? Here's a senario:(Office of Richard Zanuck, producer)
ZANUCK: What did you think of that script I told you to read?FLUNKY: Great movie, sir.ZANUCK: Who does the make up on ""Star Trek?""

The first three are the creative minds of Tim Burton (director), Rick Baker (Make-up), and Danny Elfman (Music).  The sets and locations work well with the costuming and make-up to give this an original look and an authentic feel even though it is a remake.  The cinematography and music work well together because neither one overshadows the other making the combination very powerful.
The acting was good and I must take my hat off to Helena Bonham Carter and to Tim Roth who did exceptional in their portrayals.  The supporting cast didn't stand out like Carter or Roth, but they did a good job of holding their own ground.  Mark Wahlberg's character, Leo Davidson, is the classic military hero who never shows too much emotion because he is trying to stay in control of the situation.  It almost seems that if Wahlberg weren't an actor, he would have actually been this guy.  Estella Warren's character could have easily weighed down the movie by being the typical sexy woman, but thankfully Burton never really draws attention to her in that way: we know she's beautiful, but we don't need to waste 20 minutes of the movie proving it.  She doesn't have any dense lines bent at attracting Wahlberg or any slow motion shots of her character taking a hot bath.  Instead Estella Warren does a good job of playing a character simply caught in the story and reacting in a realistic way.  A personal favorite part of mine was the cameo appearance of Charlton Heston, who almost has the same classic line that he had in the original.The story, though shaky at the beginning, quickly regains its composure and holds the audience's attention.  Once upon the actual planet, there are many satirical references to the way our society has treated animals, the environment, and each other (in cases of slavery).  It is this ability of holding a mirror to society that has made Burton a genius in his craft. Even though the storyline is a tad simple and any audience member can guess or just about guess how the whole story transpired, it doesn't matter because we are trapped in this world and we become interested in the characters interaction with each other.The ending is what could have wrapped up the entire experience into a good movie but didn't.  The last ten minutes of the movie was a horrible attempt at a twist ending.  If you watch closely you can see the movie end, but for some reason, another whole ending is added.  The problem with the second twist ending is that there is no bridge that connects this ending with the rest of the movie, so instead of discovering an ending you didn't even know you were looking for, you leave the theater thinking `Ummm ok, that doesn't make very much sense.'  The storyline should take you from point A to point B, but the ending tells you that you are actually at point C and doesn't attempt in any way, shape, or form to explain how you got there.I gave this movie a 5 because it has the attempt, it just doesn't have the follow through.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I suppose I should thank Tim Burton for that.Burton has produced a standard ""good versus bad"" action flick, with special effects and stunts succeeding each other rapidly (presumably to distract from the lack of dialogue or characterisation). It is a shame on at least two counts: one would expect more of Tim Burton (this is a film Emmerich would make); more importantly it lacks the ambiguity and moral challenges of the original series. General Thade is wicked and our hero (whose name I fail to remember) is resourceful, brave and no doubt washes behind his ears.
As I say, stunts, special effects, make up, the occasional twist. Like anyone of a dozen films every summer. Get the original.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Gotta be frustrating for all involved that they were in a remake/reboot of 1968's 'Planet of the Apes' that wasn't the 2011 version. This one walked so that one could fly etc.Speaking of flying, what the heck is with the high jumping apes in this? It looks so silly and doesn't add anything; a very odd choice. It is, though, a surprise that this film flopped given who got attached to it. Tim Burton as director, with the acting talents of Mark Wahlberg, Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan and Paul Giamatti. It's neat that Charlton Heston and Linda Harrison (stars of the original) made cameos, though.Wahlberg feels a bit miscast, though Bonham Carter and Giamatti are solid; the latter particularly seemed to enjoy the role. The film does have a Burton edge to it, as expected, but this is one of his weaker films no doubt. Some other negatives, for me, include the make-up, esp. For General Thade, - I'm in the minority there - and the story's pacing.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There is NO possible way that the events at the end of the film could have followed anything that came before it.

"8","/10","Burton provides an entertaining yet flawed ape escape","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512554/?ref_=tt_urv","SwingBatta","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0515302/?ref_=tt_urv","3 September 2001","Tim Burton has a unique, dark style that sets him far apart from other filmmakers of his generation, and he has a knack for getting the best efforts from his crews and actors.His ""reimagining"" of ""Planet of the Apes"" is a rare instance in which those qualities never come to the fore. I won't bother with prattle comparing this to the 1968 original, simply because I haven't seen it and don't plan to anytime soon.He brings back nearly the entire crew he worked with on the superior ""Sleepy Hollow""  costume designer Colleen Atwood, production designer Rick Heinrichs, editor Chris Lebenzon, and composer Danny Elfman, but this formidable unit fails to fully click this time around.Makeup guru Rick Baker (the ""Nutty Professor"" series) is responsible for the impressive simian facades, but most of the time they look instead like very expensive Halloween masks that muddle the actors' voices. The diction left much to be desired; some characters speak too low and fast (I sat in the fourth row and the theater had THX sound), and some baritone-voiced males sound as if they're talking with their mouths full.The acting is adequate but sometimes as stiff as the monkey mugs, starting with a wooden Mark Wahlberg as the centerpiece of the film, Leo Davidson. He is an Air Force captain, yet he works way up in space. The setup for his eventual crash landing onto the Planet of the Apes is flimsy and rushed. When that time comes, he doesn't look too concerned about being alone and stranded, and eventually imprisoned, in a strange new world, and he goes through the film as if this is all small potatoes to him.Thanks to bad dialogue, he inadvertently forges what may turn out to be the new pickup line of the 21st century: ""I can show you something that will change your world forever.""Needless to say, the simians are the best thespians, and that's not saying much. Tim Roth hams it up to the hilt as the villain Thade, but he can only do so much in a movie of this style. His chief henchman, played by Michael Clarke Duncan, verbally berates and knocks a few humans around here and there, and snarls lines such as, ""Get your stinkin' hands off me, you filthy human!"" and ""Bow your heads!""  And, that's it.Helena Bonham Carter is solid as Brit-accented human sympathizer Ari. Coincidentally, out of all the Apes, she looks the most human as well (and is nearly a dead ringer for Michael Jackson). Paul Giamatti, on the other hand, is annoying as Limbo the orangutan, the film's thin attempt at comic relief.The weakest link, as if it isn't too obvious, is Leo's gang of human fugitives, especially an annoying teenage boy and the token Black man whom we all know will get knocked off at some point in the film. They have no personality and serve no purpose in the plot whatsoever except to chip in with a cheesy line here and there. Supermodel Estella Warren, playing a slave girl whose father (Kris Kristofferson) is killed by the Apes, is as pointless as a broken pencil. Her skimpy outfit contained more depth than her screen presence. Most of her activity consists of staring into space with her mouth agape.By the way, I didn't realize the Planet of the Apes contained any beauty salons, because she manages to look like she just stepped out of one whenever she appears on screen.Oh, and Burton brings aboard his squeeze Lisa Marie once again for no apparent reason. This time around, she's buried under an Ape mask. As usual, she has nothing to do here except display her one-dimensional feminine wiles.The cinematography, courtesy of Phillippe Rousselot, does a nice job of stressing the foreboding, moonlit jungle environment. It's the only saving grace of the lackluster action sequences, especially in the beginning just after Leo crash-lands and finds himself in the middle of a wild huntdown of humans by Ape soldiers. Elfman comes through on the music front; because of his powerful score, I loved the opening credits sequence.Unfortunately, while Heinrichs' sets are always a visual treat, they aren't as gripping as his Oscar-winning work from SH. They are small and constricted due to the fact that there are sometimes too many characters cavorting on the screen. Upon seeing the Apes' village for the first time, I couldn't help but think of the planet Endor from ""Return of the Jedi."" The wreckage of Leo's USAF space station, however, is fantastic. It's also the location of a surprising twist in the story.Now to the plot. The reason why it falters for the most part is what ultimately crippled ""Shrek"": it has an unpleasant air of preachiness to it. By itself, the plot is as thin as Wahlberg's music career, but in a twist that seems rather uncharacteristic of Burton, ""Apes"" plays the race card. This I didn't care for. I'm aware that this angle is in the original, but it's a white elephant in Burton's version.And yes, an Ape actually utters those infamous six words...I'm sure you know what they are.The suspense factor is all but nil, and the plot twists leave behind numerous holes, such as, for example, the controls on the destroyed space station being able to work despite the wreck apparently being thousands of years old. (Plus, where did all those horses, the Apes' sole means of transportation, come from?)Then there is the well-publicized ""love triangle"" between Wahlberg, Carter and Warren that Burton hinted at in interviews. To make a long story short, if you plan to watch this solely on the basis of seeing this angle, you're in for a disappointment.Sorry, but I won't waste my breath on Charlton Heston's forgettable pot-and-kettle cameo.Save for the aforementioned chase sequence after Leo's crash landing, the action and fight scenes are pathetic. Simple punches send both humans and Apes flying a few dozen feet into the air. And don't ask the Apes to hit targets in the water that are two feet from the shore. The huge Apes-humans showdown near the end is a yawner.The much-ballyhooed ending is both surprising and ambiguous. Though Burton has vehemently denied any rumors of his helming a sequel, the conclusion is like that of a comic book and does leave the door wide open for a second installment.The film's most comical moments occurred offscreen. Before shooting began, the actors had to undergo ""ape training"" to learn primate mannerisms, and spent hours in makeup before stepping in front of the cameras. On ""failing"" ape school, Bonham Carter quipped, ""I was told I had AADD  Ape Attention Deficit Disorder."" On becoming an Ape: ""It's flattering to be cast as a chimp, because you know they haven't cast you for what you look like."" Duncan hurt his ankle while filming a pivotal scene with Kristofferson, who slipped, fell, crashed into Duncan and wound up having to get stitches. Duncan was rushed to the hospital (yes, rushed for a turned ankle  that's Hollywood for ya), in full makeup, no less. When he announced himself to a room full of patients, they burst into applause.While ""Planet of the Apes"" has some major flaws, it doesn't mean it's not entertaining, which it indeed is, but it just doesn't have that signature Tim Burton look and feel to it. It's ultimately just another Hollywood action flick.After all is said and done, his best effort to date still remains ""Sleepy Hollow.""  7.5/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Having already had to take one of the most popular comic book characters to the big screen in Batman, he then had to recreate the legend of Sleepy Hollow, before turning his eye to one of cinema's all-time classics in Planet of the Apes.Mark Wahlberg was cast in the role of main human (likened to Charlton Heston's in the original) whereas Britain's Helena Bonham-Carter was given a chance to rip up the bodices and put on the make up to become an ape along with Tim Roth and Michael Clarke-Duncan.After being dragged through a wormhole in the middle of an electrical storm, Captain Leo Davidson (Wahlberg) crash lands on a remote planet where humans are the slaves and apes rule. A sympathetic primate named Ari (Bonham-Carter) is against the suffering inflicted on humans by apes however and helps Leo along with the other human slaves escape. Eager not to let their capture get away, the ape army led by Thade (Tim Roth) and Colonel Attar (Clarke-Duncan) give pursuit as Leo frantically heads back to his ship.With so much to live up to in following the original, Tim Burton was always going to struggle to win over fans of the first. His work is as usual, dark and mysterious with most of the action taking place at night. Although adding to the planet's mystique, Burton's style does also often make it difficult to actually figure out what's going on. His re-worked ending is intriguing yet leaves many questions unanswered, with few of the plot lines coming together to complete the picture; this despite the fact that barely an hour of story has been stretched out to fill nearly two.The scenes of violence toward the end are well choreographed, but are also disturbing with all-too-lifelike apes and humans literally beating the life out of each other. It's partly from this though where the one saving grace liesThe quality of the make up work is excellent as Tim Roth, Michael Clarke-Duncan and Helena Bonham-Carter, amongst others, are transformed into perfect ape-creatures. As was shown with Godzilla however, special effects are nothing compared to solid story and the writers fail to offer anything new that can match let alone eclipse the original.Planet of the Apes 2001 is by no means a bad film, but with so much to hype and expectation to live up to it was always going to fall short. It's worth seeing for the make up jobs alone, but if you a real treat then rent the original.3/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

A+However all looks and no plot make for a bad film. The film starts of promisingly enough, but one we get to the planet of the apes it is as if the scriptwriters figured just shooting scenes of flying apes and a ragtag group of humans trying to escape (Hmmm sounds like something from the Wizard of Oz) would be enough. F-One feels sorry for the cast for having to muddle their way through this script, but then cast is not up to the task of even handling this script. Only Tim Roth as the evil General Thade turns in a great menacing performance, and winds up out acting the rest of the cast. D (Roth A+)And let's no even talk about the ending! Anyone who has watched any sci-fi films involving wormholes, etc, must have seen where this film was going from the opening few minutes.

It tells the story of astronaut Leo Davidson crash-landing on a planet inhabited by intelligent apes. The apes treat humans as slaves, but with the help of an ape named Ari, Leo starts a rebellion.The film also stars Tim Roth, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, Paul Giamatti, and Estella Warren Development for a Planet of the Apes remake started as far back as 1988 with Adam Rifkin. His project nearly reached the pre-production stage before being canceled. Terry Hayes's script, titled Return of the Apes, would have starred Arnold Schwarzenegger, under the direction of Phillip Noyce. Oliver Stone, Don Murphy, and Jane Hamsher were set to produce. Creative differences ensued between Hayes and financier/distributor 20th Century Fox. Chris Columbus, Sam Hamm, James Cameron, Peter Jackson, and the Hughes brothers later became involved.With William Broyles, Jr.'s script, Tim Burton was hired as director, and the film was put into active development. Lawrence Konner and Mark Rosenthal rewrote the script, and filming took place from November 2000 to April 2001. Planet of the Apes was released to mixed reviews, but was a financial success. Much criticism focused on the confusing plot and ending, although Rick Baker's prosthetic makeup designs were praised.The story is a little confusing, but it is easy to look at for me, but for everyone else, a lot of people and critics and also fans of the franchise hates this story and the ending. The ending is just confusing also, but it's easy to overlook these two major flaws.The music by Danny Elfman is just awesome and the song that plays during the end credits titled, ""Rule the Planet Remix"" is awesome, mixed by Paul Oakenfold and composed by Danny Elfman. The rest of the music including the opening theme music is just spectacular and the film does wonders with the music.The visual effects and makeup is just spectacular also, but Rick Baker did the prosthetic make-up effects for the apes and it is a blessing of him. The visuals are a little cheesy, but works for this type of movie.The acting, is just good and bad. The only credit that will be given to is Mark Wahlberg, his performance as the lead was amazing. Helena Bonham Carter, Estella Warren and Michael Clarke Duncan puts on really good performances as well, but they can get way too over-the- top in some of the scenes. Paul Giamatti is hilarious and he does an amazing job. Luke Eberl and Erick Avari is in the film, too, but they're performances were a little confusing. Charlton Heston has a cameo as Thade's dad. Tim Roth plays the villain, Thade and he is okay, but even then, he is over-the-top as well.Overall, with the 2001 remake of Planet of the Apes, it's not a bad re-imagining, but it could have done much better than this. I like and hate this remake of the 1968 original classic.Despite its financial success, 20th Century Fox chose not to produce a sequel, and later rebooted the franchise in 2011 with Rise of the Planet of the Apes.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Most of his films have some eerie, dark atmosphere and quirkiness that's irresistable to most viewers.Something that this film doesn't have.The only impressive aspect of this remake are the elaborate set designs and convincing make-up (watch out for Michael Jackson's cameo as Ari).At first, the film impressed me. It looked cool, the score was good. Then I noticed a pattern in the film.Dialogue scene to running, to more running, back to dialogue, more running, rinse, wash and repeat.Mark Wahlberg is a good actor but he's quite laughable here. Wait until you see his speech about rising up against the apes. This one suffers from the age-old cliche of the band of people too afraid to fight back for the freedom with no choice otherwise. Well, unless they want to die and be put in slavery (at least that would take off the running time a bit).The female character (insert model's name here) is simply used for the sex scene, but there isn't one. The big budget is used for the cool battles that couldn't be done on a small budget. But there is no big cool, entertaining battle. It goes on and on. Should I talk about the ending? If you enjoyed the film you'll say ""Wow! What a smart, intelligent ending! Now, if I just knew what it means..."" and weeks later you're still puzzling over it until you realize Tim Burton has wasted even more of your time thinking it actually makes sense.

The blond savage was the highlight of this movie with her sequined(I didn't actually notice the sequins, but it was commented by the rest of the excited crowd gagging on the movie), tight-fitting, low-cut cave woman swimsuit, and I can't forget to mention the sexy red lipstick she manages to keep smudge-free throughout the movie. *note:  i just heard ""what a crap movie!"" as i'm typing this review.

The fact it that this is a flawed movie, saved by Tim Burton's fantastic Visual Style and Danny Elfmans terrific score. The Cultural references are terrific: but once they are scrutinized further- sure it's unlikely that Apes would develop beautiful armour reminiscent of Ancient Armour worn by Turkish Knight in their religious wars, but man they look terrific and fill this strange world with a rich history and culture! While most merely see ""REMAKE"" up in lights and scoff at Hollywood- the film is more of a tribute to The concept of what Planet of the Apes has become, evolved with the help of fans through a horde of crappy sequels and weak spin off television series to the point where Pierre Boulle and what we know as Planet of the Apes are actually worlds apart. Bravely however, the films controversial finale is not to be taken seriously in any way! The ending which I will not give away, is an homage to many things.It's a tribute to Insane Sci- Fi, The deliberately profound endings to both the original film and Boulle's novel, and having a bit of a chuckle.It's like the Twilight Zone without taking itself seriously in any way.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I didn't care if all the apes died or the humans were wiped out.  The big battle at the end was about as ""epic"" as the jim carrey fight scene in Dumb and Dumber.  Cheese ball ape-human love scene with some out-right horrible add-ons, like having the young boy ride out to help and oops, don't you know it, his horse falls. I guess since humans are animals and don't have horses readily available we shouldn't expect them to be doing and jousting are dressage.  Predictable ending that lacked the jaw dropping effect of the original.  Terrible cameo with Heston, ain't it funny the president of the NRA is now dressing up in ape make-up and preaching the evils of technology and guns.  The make-up was beautiful and some performances were actually good, but the real problem is, if you're going to use the same name as the original, it better be as good as the original.  I expected better.  Sleepy Hollow, Beetlejuice, Edward scissor hands.....

I feel the movie was not well-written. The characters are way too underdeveloped (especially Wahlberg's). The movie does have a great sense of artistic direction (the scenery, make-up and props are very enticing and alluring). However, I feel the movie moved at a way too easy by-the-numbers pace. There was never any real drama or suspense invested into the script. The interaction between the characters is often stale and almost wishing to be something more redeeming. Another aspect that really confused me was regarding the humans on the ape planet. These humans were obviously able to speak, thus they were intelligent. So, why were these humans unable to have formed a much stronger resistance to the apes?  (In the original Planet of the Apes movie, the native humans were more underdeveloped like cavemen who still could not speak.) The ending of the 2001 remake was too weak and only guarantees us the possiblity that someone else might provide us with another sequel.My advice: catch this movie on cable and don't bother to rent or buy it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Character exposition in the opening sequence was axed in order to bustle the hero (or lack of one) into the so-called action as soon as possible. What results is a woefully underdeveloped series of events thrusting us along on an adventure that is laughable and miserably cheap. Tim Burton's influences lay in many obscure and cheesy drive-in sci/fi movies and TV shows of the past (which he actually tries to pay homage to rather than satirize) and it's not surprising that this film plays like Lost in Space meets One Million Years BC meets Claude Rains' version of The Lost World meets Planet of the Apes. If Burton felt that people would be excited at the prospect of seeing his own self-indulgent vision of the Book and Heston's classic, full of gawdy touches typical of his style, he was badly mistaken. His realization of Batman was far more successful.When I first saw the commercials for this movie I was immediately taken. Images of marching Ape armies and the atmospheric visuals inspired hopes of a science Fiction action epic like no other. Spartacus conquers the Apes as it were. Sadly it was all window dressing and the truly best parts of this movie are ALL in the commercial spots. What we are subjected to is an unspeakably badly written visual feast which belies a very limited budget lurking just below the surface. The only reason to see this abomination is for the costumes and make-up design, as well as the production design (aside from the space station and space suits which look to have been stolen from the 2001 prop vault).The original planet of the apes is not one of my top ten favorite films but it is an honest and intelligent piece of science fiction. Though a bit of a talk fest, it does bring up some very thought provoking issues (thanks to the great Rod Serling) and ends on one of the most powerful and stunning climaxes in movie history. It's a film deserving of its classic status and rated a better remake than what Richard Zanuck and Tim Burton have foisted on us here. In fact, Zanuck should be fined and his producer's license suspended as he was also in involved in making the original.Any and all intellectual content is missing leaving us with good actors buried under mounds of make-up. Except for Wahlberg, who should have just been buried. This guy is the most vacant action hero since Keanu Reeves in Speed. Aside from disobeying commands in order to rescue his chimp, his motivations are unwritten, leaving him to loaf from one scene to the next muttering little more than ""hey"" or ""what"" or ""whatever"", while glancing more than periodically at his Tandy hand-held. The guy has the intelligence and personality of a soapsud. An actor with a grasp of dead-pan humor might have made this character zing. Wahlberg just sits there, looking constipated as another IMDb reviewer mentioned.As far as the other cast members are concerned, what is the deal with Kris Kristoffersen. He has two lines then gets run through with a spear. Estella Warren is atrocious as the obligatory female human. She's no Raquel Welch in the looks department and is an even worse actress. Helena Bonham-Carter is wasted, as is Tim Roth as Thade and Michael Clark Duncan as his Right-Hand Gorilla. One wonders why they hired big-name actors to be unrecognizable under all that latex when they could have hired medium priced actors and saved some money on the budget. Marquee power I guess. As good as he is, Michael Clark Duncan just sounds like the guy who played Worf in Star Trek.As far as Charlton Heston's uncredited cameo as Thade's father, spouting familiar lines he used to condemn the Apes in the original, though here in reversed context: maybe in another script, with a better director for the material, it would have been sly and humorous. Not here. The same goes for other memorable lines quoted from the original.Much has been debated about the ending, which is about the only pure Burtonian stamp on the movie. It has no relevance other than to set-up a sequel (would anyone care to see it?). It pays homage to Serling and is a twist on the original's shattering ending, but really it comes off more of a tribute to Marty's nightmare sequence in Back to the Future Part II than anything else.What we're left with here, in the wake of other deficient hack jobs such as U-571, The Patriot, Pearl Harbor, and How the Grinch Stole Christmas, is a clear message that a great deal of Hollywood no longer cares about providing their audience with a well written and performed production once their marketing machine has lured us into the theatres. If people keep falling for it it's going to end up sealing the end of quality entertainment for good.Here's hoping that The Lord of the Rings doesn't turn out to be a mishandled treatment of Tolkien with GREAT commercials.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is an exciting film, one that sets up beautifully at a near future research station in some unidentified area of space.  Once Mark Wahlberg arrives en medias res at the Primate Ruled Planet, we are carried through a remarkably other world, a masterpiece of set design.  In addition, choreography of primate movements is entirely believable, a foreign yet familiar fusion of primal simian movement and human barbarism. 
Where the film begins to show its warts is its inability to follow up on the plot premises it establishes.  Various mentions and trappings of mysticism, which serve the film well, disappear under the relentless pacing. Wahlberg's prophecied astronaut is not significantly charismatic enough nor spiritually aware enough to be the centerpiece of a film that wants badly to do more than simply be another big, dumb action movie but seldom achieves more than those humble lows.And in the end, an error in editing, direction, writing, or all of the above brings a film to lows that I was perfectly will to accept, warts and all. The last 10 minutes almost ruined the film for me (and I won't spoil it for everyone but ask yourself it makes any sense at all when watching it).  This is one of the most insufferably bone-headed, senseless finales in filmmaking history.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I am satisfied with the way this one was done.  I am afraid of disappointment if I watch the original.The plot is excellent, first of all.  There's a nice plot twist at the end involving the origins of all apes that puts everything together and just feels right.  There is plenty of action and, in a way, romance, too.  It's a great sci-fi flick with plenty of action.The storyline isn't too original--escape, then get reinforcements to fight off the antagonists.  But it still does its job.  It keeps you watching.The music is composed by Danny Elfman.  He has a certain militaristic flare in this movie which really sounds good.  The music is excellent, taking on tribal drums at some points and bombastic themes that whirl together perfectly.The costumes are great.  The apes look just like they should.  The graphics are decent, but not overall groundbreaking.I was and am still really impressed with this movie.  It has a lot of things that kept me going and makes me want to watch it again and again.

All the plot-holes have been mentioned elsewhere in this review section, suffice it to say, there is little ways of getting around most of them. They just don't make sense ! - and the chimp saving the day was a very poor way to end it.The actual plot runs thin half-way through the movie and the final battle was rather anti-climatic I thought. I will go and see a sequel if there is one, but with a lot less excitement than I had for this film.I can't say it wasn't good, because I never looked at my watch during the cinema, but it wasn't the best BLOCKBUSTER SUMMER movie of the year (that was Jurassic Park 3 and earlier Bridget Jones and Hannibal), but it was entertaining enough. Sadly I will always feel the *most* apt word for the movie is ""Disappointing"".Yd.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'd hoped Tim Burton would bring the same clarity of vision he brought to Sleepy Hollow, Ed Wood and even the first Batman.  Instead, he gave us the second Batman: some great visuals, a few strong archetypes and a terrible script.  Tim Roth as the feral chihuahua was ridiculously over-the-top and not in a good way.  Perhaps Rick Baker should've stopped punching Estella Warren in the mouth long enough to find her motivation.  Or at least a personality.  This was a straight-ahead, cliched escape movie, with no pause for character development.  The ending wasn't as bad as many suggest and is definitely feasible if you consider that Thade's ultimate fate is left up in the air.  It'll take some explaining but it's possible.  All in all, I'm hoping Burton will take a pass on the sequel and let someone with stronger STORYTELLING skills take over.

The sorry parade of Ape movies that followed into the '70s was my first experience with Hollywood's ""Sequel System"" of pumping as much revenue as possible from any spavined idea that is a hit with audiences.  This may, in fact, have been an early iteration of that now-standard practice.Needless to say, I had no expectation of anything more than a mild diversion when I wandered into a matinee showing of Tim Burton's take on this shriveled old chestnut. To my surprise, and despite the fact that Mark Wahlberg sleep-walked his way through the entire movie, it worked a lot better than the original.  General Thade (Tim Roth) is by far the most engaging character in the movie, and the only one that overcomes his ape makeup with an identifiable personality. I was almost rooting for HIM by the end of the movie.Burton's portrayal of the preening, officious Ape Elite and their personal habits is a sly look at some of our own human foibles. I recognized a couple of ex-bosses during those scenes. Original cast member and current NRA President Charleton Heston has a cameo that becomes hilarious when he shows son Thade his ""proof"" of human ingenuity. I wonder how many viewers missed the humor in that because they are ignorant of Heston's NRA activities? It's refreshing to see an actor of his age and station who is able to poke fun at himself.Happily, this ""homage"" to the original carries enough originality to keep it interesting (let's just say there was never a Statue of Liberty on this planet) and has better pacing and a lot more action than the original. The effects are seamless and there is enough humor to break up any monotony.The movie climaxes about 10 minutes before it ends, which is too bad. The last few scenes are a total throwaway (and perhaps a foreshadowing of the dreaded Sequelitis), but hey, we can't all be Shakespeare all of the time.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

He does a below average job portraying Wahlberg's character, the star of the film.  Other characters get slightly better treatment, but what about the kid who Wahlberg's character saves as the ape army attacks? Almost no background, just a couple of shots of him being insubordinate to Wahlberg, a person that the humans on the planet are in awe of.  Would a kid really be that brash?The story is good, the acting is fine, the scenery is superb.  The climax of the film is great, though I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't seen it.

I must admit I was pleasantly surprised by this effort. Of course, it was never going to be as good as the original, the ending to the Charlton Heston classic has to be one of the best endings to a film in movie history. I was satisfied that things were well enough explained throughout this film, for example, the talking humans, and how the apes got to inhabit the planet in the first place. What I couldn't work out was the ending, I wont go into details for those who haven't seen it, but I do feel that because the 1968 classic had such a shocking and thought provoking ending, the writers of this version almost `felt obliged' to try and live up to that and as a result it doesn't really make any sense and tie in with the story you have just followed for the past 2 hours  or maybe it does and I just missed the point!, either way  FAR too confusing! (Although it screams ""sequel!"" - how convenient!!). Wahlberg is okay as astronaut Leo Davidson, while Tim Roth is wickedly good fun as cruel military ape `General Thade'.

However, here I'm going to focus on the most positive points, rather than the negative ones.The Seal I talked before is present as in any of Burton's films. I mainly refer to the conception of the eccentric, delirious, out-of-this-world characters and to the Gothic-romantic, fantastic art direction this films radiates (I don't have to mention previous examples, but Batman, Nightmare and Edward are and will remain in our minds). Danny Elfman gives again the best of himself with a dynamic, at times majestic score where percussion leads.The apes are incredible, they work, they really rock in the show. Not only for Rick Baker's make-up masterpiece (which deserves not the nomination but the Academy Award NOW!), which gives them live and expression unlike 1968's sort of dummies, but because they are credible... and light years far more credible (and even more human) than the film's humans, except for Mr. Whalberg. The script said they had to talk this time.Can anybody tell me if they liked them? If they found their importance to their dialogues? And why Stella Warren hasn't been issued with the ""manikin"" label, as Jake Lloyd was in ""Episode 1""? The native roles show no interest and slow the rhythm of the movie.Now, returning to the apes, I have to talk about the real showman:Tim Roth as Thade. Exceptional. Histrionic. Aggressive. Cool. Evil portrayed as an ape. As the Ape General, he gets so very deep into the role that you end up thinking Roth, after all his extense and peculiar filmography, has finally turned crazy and really believes he's a monkey free in the stage. He is of the very few actors, along with Gary Oldman, Edward Norton and De Niro, which I consider as chameleons:ready to face any kind of role, however obscure, violent or psychologically strong they are.About the rest, I'm definitely getting in love with Helena Bonham Carter (another example of the ape's astonishing expressivity),and Mark Whalberg is fine as always. I liked his role, in comparison with Heston's in 1968, because he is a pure survivor who wants to go home with his friends and family (he just doesn't fit in that planet), while Charlton arrived there by accident and became a revolutionary hero. .To finish with, about the ending: perfect. I love it. And I love it because 1) It is different, it's of the few which make the viewer's imagination work, so anyone can figure out an explanation to the ending the way they want, 2) Its philosophy, the paradox it represents, which I'm not going to tell, and 3)It is extremely ""Burtonesque"".""Planet Of The Apes"" reflects again the style of an excellent director, but shows his vulnerability in works he doesn't personally project (remember the initial idea came from James Cameron), in which a studio, and not himself, determines most of the finished work. However, an entertaining film, recommended to any sci-fi lover. And an advice: read the original book by Pierre Boulle for another view of the story...

I like remakes that change things up a bit while having some essence and premise from the original. And this movie did change things up a lot compared to the original but it took a lot away from what made the original good. The movie felt like it was more about racism than sci-fi ideology and theory which I found to be interesting in the original. And it lacked the creepy and mysterious sci-fi elements that was in the original. It's a watchable movie but it just goes in a very narrow and direct direction and not in a good way either. Nothing is really imaginative and it just didn't get me immersed or interested on what was going on. I was just going along with it until it ended. The original ""Planet of the Apes"" was far-fetched but this was is more non-believable and even absurd. Also maybe if it tried to modernize it in a cool sci-fi direction it might have been at least somewhat entertaining but it lacked that as well while having the similar corniness of the original. The apes being apes didn't even play a crucial part in the story.4.5/10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Movies like these (ESPECIALLY Sci-Fi movies) are very rare, and i must admit, when I was walking into the theatre, I thought this was going to be an awful movie ripping off the previous ""Planet of the Apes"". I was so wrong.The movie starts off with Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) in a USAF Starbase that experiences a strange nebula. The captain sends out one of Leo's monkeys to explore the nebula, but they lose contact with the monkey. Leo jumps in another spaceship and goes looking for the monkey (Which was very strange in the beginning, but they had to get him on the planet somehow, I guess). When he gets trapped in the nebula, he goes forward in time and lands on an alien planet (Unlike the previous movie, where Leo lands on a futuristic earth). He encounters a group of humans who are running from the apes. Leo is very confused, which becomes a major point for the beginning of the movie.The film is a direct remake from the original, but is much darker, thanks to the wonderful directing of Tim Burton. He captured the atmosphere from the previous film perfectly, but he also added a bit of an extra touch by making the apes seem much more menacing. The performances aren't Oscar-worthy, but they aren't bad (Including Mark Wahlberg, who I think was always a good actor since his starring role in the movie ""Boogie Nights), and the make-up by Rick Baker is sure to get him an Academy Award. The music by Danny Elfman is amazing (Including the opening theme, which in my opinion is probably one of my top 5 themes) and it perfectly captures the atmosphere in the movie. But probably the most controversial point in the movie is the ending. It was either you understood it, or you didn't. Luckily, I was one of the people that understood it, and it almost made the movie for me. But without spoiling any of the ending, let me just say this: It's very sequel-friendly (Which in my case is a good thing)Review: ****1/2 / *****","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Mark Wahlberg showed as much emotion and sensitivity as a toilet seat and one just can't imagine him as David leading the robotic humans over the Goliath apes. It also seemed way beyond the bounds of reason that ALL the apes would suddenly become tolerant and glad to consider their former slaves their equals-as we all know too well, racism and bigotry are not so easily erased.

The human actors are uniformly wooden and seemingly unaffected by thousands of years of oppression, not to mention that lipstick and hairspray seem to have been developed in the jungle somehow.If you can overlook the glaring plot holes, and somehow completely ignore the, lets face it, ridiculous ending, then you stand a chance of appreciating the truly fantastic apes. If this movie could have been made without the human element, it would be an excellent portrayal in itself, as it is, this film never rises above mildly entertaining.

Incapable of organized rebellion.  Thus it made more sense to have a strange space man come down and be seen as truly 'different' from the others.In this new version the humans, as we see them, don't seem particularly stupid, just overpowered.  For Markie Mark's character to be singled out as somehow 'different' doesn't make any sense whatsoever, because the other humans speak, reason, communicate, and organize without any difficulty.A shame, then, that this version lost the whole idea of the space man leading a race of humanoids who appeared normal yet were somewhat strange and incapable.  The only disadvantage humans seemed to have in this movie was some lack of muscle strength - and only barely.2) The portrayal of 'stranger in a strange land' is always very compelling. The audience puts themselves in the stranger's shoes and thinks, how would I react?  What would I do?  Would I stand up and say ""hey, I'm not a normal human like these others, can I talk to someone in charge here?""  Would we lie in wait to suss out the situation before 'taking sides'?  Would we ask questions of our fellow captives?  There are any number of things we would do or contemplate.However this movie just charges through that whole stage of the story and explores none of these possibilities.  The moment he (literally) hits the ground, Markie Mark assumes the role of 'one of the hunted humans' and never makes any attempt whatsoever to say, ""hey, wait a second, can someone explain what's happening here?  because I have an interesting story to tell. Hey apes, i may be smarter than you assume.""Lost opportunities, both.Plus the movie expropriates so many 'catch phrases' of American race relations dialogue as to be nauseating (""Can't we all just get along?"" ""Separate but equal"" etc. etc.)  Talk about bonking us over the head.And the ending is as preposterous as everyone says.Pretty costumes.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Although direction wasn't the main problem with this film, the writing was 2-dimensional and atrocious to character development.  It relied heavily on apes screaming and tossing humans 20 feet in the air at the drop of a hat (not that I blame them; I would've done the same to Mark based on his wooden performance).  The battle scene was solved with such an element of corniness, the teeny boppers behind me with eyes glued to Mr. Wahlberg actually came to their senses and laughed.  This movie deserved better craftsmanship of plot vehicles.The only really redeeming thing about this film was a ""pretty good considering"" performance by Helena Bonham Carter, monkey makeup and all. She found a wry character and an interesting crush on Mark Wahlberg's character, handling everything that she came across with a fair amount of grace.All in all, the movie is worth checking out- once.

But to believe, in a ""relativistic universe,"" where we all supposedly evolved by pure chance without intelligent design nor moral purpose, a BEAST like an ape is going to develop a moral sense and espouse a knowledge of ""right and wrong"" (where this came from is never stated) is just laughable.  And this is almost how the movie comes off.I would have been more able to suspend my disbelief had the apes--ALL the apes, been truly beasts.  It would have been horrific and been, FINALLY, this remake's only shot at equalling (let alone improving over) its 1968 original by creating a more potent nightmare.  Instead, it tries to re-create the original's formula--as if any of us would still be ""oh'd"" by the notion that this ""actually could happen.""Been there, done that.So, instead of exploiting the truly hellish potential of this concept, we are constantly reminded that this is a remake.  No risks are taken.  No opportunity missed to ""sensitize our political ignorance"" (thanks, Ms. Ape).

There were certainly things in this film which made it worth seeing.Despite what is said, the visuals and effects were interesting.  There was enough story to at least hold the interest of most.Sadly, what it lacked are those elements which made the original PotA good. The original had weak effects to be sure and the plot even had its problems. Nonetheless the depth of the plot, the debate about the content of man, the thoughts and concepts that were classic, are all missing.  I would have hoped that in a ""re-imagining"" the philosophy and concepts would have CHANGED; but not that they would have been omitted.I still use illustrations from the original to elucidate points.  I didn't walk away with such a feeling from this movie.  The debate between superiority of human vs. ape has been reduced to scant allusion to racial tension.  There is enough illogic to not deserve itemization (the horses have already been discussed quite throughly).  Worst of all was the ending. My friend and I are quite familiar with sci-fi, fantasy, irony and great literature.  We ""get"" most every reference.  However, BOTH of us looked at each other and said ""huh""?  While there may be some explanations for this they didn't even establish enough clues for some healthy hypothesizing.  It seemed just ""thrown in"" and out of context with the rest of the movie.To close out the critique I will just state that there is a positively tragic movement in Hollywood to ""dumb down"" every creation.  It's like Hollywood has the touch of mental mediocrity.  You'd think for scores of millions of dollars they could somehow come up with a story and content worth the millions of dollars of effects.  Give us something that can stimulate our minds, not just our senses.  I fear this ""re-imagining"" fell prey to this phenomenon.That being said, I return full circle to the fact that this movie enough going for it to have been enjoyable were it to stand on its own (and taking into account the current brain-dead state of today's Hollywood scripts). There were a couple homages to the original movie which gave us a laugh or two.  As I said, the effects and even visual composition were worth seeing. If you wish to see a movie to go ""ooooh"" and ""aaahhhh"" over the effects as opposed to the ""invisible effect"" approach (where you are engrossed in the story, not aware of the visuals being ""effects""), then you will enjoy this.I would recommend watching this.  Just enjoy it for what it is and don't expect a level of content comparable to the original.  At the very least, this movie is FAR beyond the level of any ""Apes"" SEQUELS, which had thoroughly useless plots without the concession of good effects.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Tim Burton's ambitious attempt to remake a dubious classic is certainly not the worst offender of the summer, but it may be the one that wastes the most potential.  In trying to avoid the pitfalls of most remakes, Burton and his scripters have tortured logic to contravene the ""surprise"" ending of the original to the point that their story makes little dramatic or logical sense.  With decent make-up (the lady apes are a little silly-looking), cool sets, and impressive stunt-actor acrobatics, the movie has great visual appeal, but the story veers between an allegory of man's inhumanity to man-like beings and an epic action film without ever managing to be entertaining.  See coincidence stretched once again to the breaking point, lame one-liners that no one laughs at, meaningless characters who serve no dramatic or thematic purpose, all in the service of a story with no real point.  Have to applaud the hilarious scene where perennial NRA pimp Charlton Heston as a dying father ape reveals that the secret family treasure is a hand-gun, and some of the ape cultural touches (loved the way they mounted horses) are really neat, but generally this movie left me feeling like I had wasted over two hours of my life and several points of my IQ.  And after this summer, I don't have much left.  Easily Tim Burton's worst movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

He's got more versatility; will at least try to stretch his acting (Although for my taste he's being more and more horribly miscast in Timmy films). He was excellent in ""Astronaunt's Wife""--Pretty Boy Wooden on Kazoo Wahlberg? Oh please! Or how about this casting Michael Keaton if not Depp??? Timmy B don't know how to cast a male lead to save his life! In terms of female leads he does better with HB-C but her in this???? IMO she should have been skipped over for casting in this flick at any & all levels. Elegant &/or down the down to every woman, whatever the character type or past & present, is her forte. As much as I hate her squat screen time role in ""Charlie & the Chocolate Factory"", it wasn't a SCI-FI Film! Get Veronica Cartwright, Robin Curtis, Terry Ferrell any experienced sci-fi actress who could rise above the level of unbelievable.The reasons I believe Timmy B had Chalty Heston doing his little bit here are 2 fold: 1) thought it would wow fans of the 1st movie ergo they'll come in droves trying to find what scene he's in; & 2) promised he'd pad Heston's bankroll. In case of reason #1, next time he wants to draw in fans of a media icon to a cinema adaptions, especially in the area of sci-fi, talk to Michael Bay regarding his casting of a main robot character 2007 movie adaption, for crying out loud!Oh wait a sec, just remembered--""The Astronaunt's Wife"" wasn't directed by Timmy.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I bet he has Roger Corman's entire collection.  Why else would he make a good film about a terrible filmmaker (Ed Wood)?  Why else would he make his own B-movie contribution (Mars Attacks), and why else would he remake the most famous B-movie EVER? 
Well I will say one thing; Burton is true to the genre.  What we have with Planet of the Apes is a somewhat diverting, overbudgeted, ridiculously scripted and acted movie.  However the worst part of this movie is not anything inside the movie.  It was the promotion.  This movie looked like a serious sci-fi attempt to succeed where the old version ridiculously (and entertaingly) failed.  But Tim Burton is unfortunately too true to the original.  Sure the make-up and special effects were cool, but there was nothing truly spectacular.  There were no moments where the audience was left in awe.  The battle sequences were huge disappointments and there was no real conflict set up anywhere.  It seemed that the screenwriters tried too hard not to let the movie drag and subsequently there was no tension or catharsis at the end.  The enormous cast is given criminally little to do.  Especially Tim Roth.  Yes the same Tim Roth that a few years ago created the deliciously evil Archibald Cunningham in Rob Roy is wasted.  His character Thane does nothing but snarl, growl, and bare his teeth.  There are attempts to make him human, but the script keeps the character so flat that the audience doesn't hate him, they just think he is annoying.  Luckily Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Paul Giamatti are all given a little more to do, but none of them are really compelling.  As for Whalburg, I can't find a thing to say about him, which means he did his job, but he didn't necessarily shine.  So the characters are flat, there is no dramatic tension and no catharsis, save at the very end when you find yourself laughing hysterically at how incredibly bad this movie is.  And then you realize that Burton is laughing too.  He meant the movie to be bad.  his tongue is planted firmly in his cheek.  And then you think maybe just maybe it's not so bad at all.
But while this movie succeds in being good by being bad, it falls way short of greatness.  You may be entertained, but I guarantee you will be disappointed.  5/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","dismal remake","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512661/?ref_=tt_urv","Buddy-51","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0375636/?ref_=tt_urv","24 November 2001","`Planet of the Apes' is a joyless, soulless and utterly pointless remake of the 1968 sci-fi classic.  The original film had two strong elements going for it:  its expansive visual style and its playful spirit.  Both qualities have been effectively eliminated in Tim Burton's update, along with the sense of wonder that came, thirty-three years ago, when the material was still innovative and fresh.  What viewer can forget the time he first saw that stunning final shot of the earlier version, with a weary Charlton Heston coming upon the remains of the Statue of Liberty - then bellowing in outrage at the tragic reality hitherto unrevealed to both him and us? Burton, not wanting to be a slavish devotee to the original (and not wanting the audience to know everything about the story in advance of entering the theatre), attempts a similar `surprise' ending here, but the execution of it is so ludicrous, confused and clumsy that all one can do is scratch one's head and giggle in bemused befuddlement.Much of the effectiveness of the original `Planet of the Apes' lay in its deliberately paced buildup.  The early stretches of the film, in which Heston and his fellow astronauts wandered the desert in search of life, helped immensely in generating an atmosphere of suspense and mystery.  In the new version, however, the lone hero, Thade (Mark Wahlberg), crash lands on the planet and, almost instantaneously, finds himself caught in this strange world in which evolution seems to have taken a reverse course, where apes speak and have dominion over docile humans - though they're not quite as docile as they were in the first version since in this edition the humans speak, rendering absurd the idea that the apes would consider humans to be a subspecies.   Also, in the original version, much of the time was spent focusing on Heston's attempts to convince the apes that he was every bit as smart as they were.  Thus, much of the pleasure of the film came from the fact that there seemed to be a duel of wits going on between apes and humans  a contest that often took the form of high-spirited, clever and even witty dialogue exchanges.  For all the ludicrousness of its premise, the original `Planet of the Apes' was not a DUMB movie.  I wish one could say the same for the remake.  The plotting in this version essentially boils down to little more than an extended and distended chase story, with apes racing madly after humans from one dimly lit locale to the next. 
And here we come upon another problem with the movie  one it shares with many modern action flicks, actually, especially those made by Burton.  It is simply shot too dark.  One of the qualities that distinguished the original film from most of the sci-fi adventure films that came before it was the near-epic feeling created by its beautiful wide screen images of the desert setting.  These shots lent a visual impressiveness to the potentially childish material and helped to bring an aura of seriousness to the proceedings.  In Burton's version, however, the visual style is often dark, cramped and confining, not at all conducive to the sense of majesty and awe that Franklin Schaffner's version afforded.Wahlberg is a bland substitute for Heston who, dressed only in a loincloth and hissing virtually every line through clenched teeth, seemed to sense the camp potential hidden beneath the story's surface  a fact not acknowledged by the stolid Wahlberg (or by Burton for that matter).  How we miss the charming personalities of Roddy McDowell and Kim Hunter as the sympathetic ape characters.  Poor Helena Bonham Carter, in the Hunter role, doesn't get to recite even one vaguely amusing line.  It seems amazing that a movie made thirty-three years ago would take itself so much less seriously than a film made today.  One would expect that a filmmaker like Burton, known for his ability to find humor in the most macabre of situations, would be the last director to take such a humorless, deadpan approach to material like this.   The original `Planet of the Apes' managed to combine the elements of originality, suspense, humor, irony, surprise and visual acuity to create a work of lasting value and interest. My prediction is that copies of it will still be on video store shelves long after this remake has hit the bargain-price recycling bins.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Yes, it has it's flaws, but for the most part was well executed.  Tom Rothwas pure evil, some have said that he was ""too evil"", but isn't that the point of a super-villain?  His character was over the top, and I loved it.  The only real flaw for me was that Mark Whalberg kept slipping into Dirk Diggler, but I was able to ignore him for most of the film.  As for the ending, it was great.  I don't think that it was supposed to be logical, so stop whining!  It was a great over the top way to end an over the top film/concept.

"1","/10","Tim Burton has always been overrated","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1141810/?ref_=tt_urv","pierotti","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3791238/?ref_=tt_urv","3 August 2005","It may be a bit late to weigh in on this film, but I feel compelled to if for no other reason than that Tim Burton has just arrogantly messed with another classic, Charlie and Chocolate Factory, and has once again screwed things up. Burton has no concept of plot or acting, his style is entirely visual, and he is dishonest as all get out when he wants to make a point. I'm sorry that Tim had problems with his parents, especially his father, but that does not justify his screwing with classic stories so that he can whine once again about how parents just don't understand you and might even abandon you.Having got that off my chest, I would like to summarize POTA as follows. The movie makes no sense and the reason it makes no sense is that the director has no vision, no sense of a story that he wants to tell. Even the highly touted ape makeup is a mistake, because the director has no idea whether the apes are supposed to be subhuman or better than human. As a consequence they behave in a manner that simply leaves the viewer confused.I am a biologist who has studied behavior in apes, so I might be more picky than most, but I defy any viewer to answer the following question. Why are all the female apes chimpanzees? I have watched the ape village scenes several times and to my view there is not a single female gorilla or orang utan in the entire place. Also these female chimps don't look like chimps, but like some sort of odd chimp/human hybrid, which might explain the attraction between Marky Mark and Helena BC, but otherwise feels just thrown in (This is what I mean by Burton throwing logic out the window to make his themes fit his preconceptions). For example why does the female chimp (Carter) have eyebrows, a trait missing from every primate but humans? Also why do chimps, which seem to make up the vast majority of the apes, walk upright except when they charge? This makes them very ineffective as warriors. They can't hold weapons, so why do they wear armor? The acting in this film is confusing and few characters seem realized, and once again I think Burton is to blame. In Burton films the only actors who are memorable are those willing to create their own characters and overact shamelessly, e.g. Michael Keaton's Beetlejuice, Nicholson's Joker, DeVito's Penguin, Walken's headless horseman. In this film this tradition is carried on by Tim Roth's Thade, a character so psychotic it seems amazing that anyone takes him seriously. The cast includes some good actors, but all are handicapped by bad direction. For example, Paul Giamatti an excellent character actor, tries hard to create a believable character in his whining sycophantic slave trading orang utan, but he is made up as a female rather than a male orang utan, which collapses the character completely.Other actors fare no better. Wahlberg, at best a charming male ingénue, cannot act like a leader, so I was startled by the idea that all the humans would follow his lead when he seems to have no idea as to what he's doing throughout the entire film. The other humans seem to be merely tagging along looking confused. Michael Clarke Duncan, subtle and wonderful in the Green Mile, here plays sort of a King Kong who can talk. As a subtext, why are the Gorillas played by Afrcian American actors, and the chimps by white actors? This leads me to what I think is Burton's greatest weakness, his ability to direct actresses. The only actress who has ever turned in a memorable performance in a Burton film is Michelle Pfeiffer's sly, slinky Catwoman in Batman II. Otherwise excellent actresses have been left to flounder by Burton, e.g. Christina Ricci is Sleepy Hollow, Kim Basinger in Batman. Given this history, I find confusing all of the hostility and crass comments about Estella Warren's performance as Daena, the only human in the film with any personality. Estella Warren is a powerful presence, who in every film in which she appears works from the premise that she is, at the least, the equal of all the male characters and that she is smarter even than most of those. She tries to pull that off in POTA, but she is left to flounder, trying to work off the giant vacuum emitted by Marky Mark. Warren acts using her face to communicate subtle emotions and changes of mood, but that tactic backfires in this film, where subtlety is lost. She gets no perceivable reactions from Wahlberg, who seems lost in his own world, and she has almost no scenes with anyone else. As a result Warren has little to do but look distressed and confused. I think most of the negative comments directed at Warren's acting come from silly insecure young men who feel that a pretty woman should not also be strong and competent, and simply want to ogle her.To summarize, this film is probably the worst big budget film ever made, but don't blame the actors. As they say in Russia, fish begin to stink from the head. In this case the head is the director.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Why can't the studios just bring out the original films, instead of remaking them? I will admit that I went to see this film with as much trepidation as going to see Gus Van Sant's misguided redo of Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" a few years back. This isn't as bad as that, but it's very close. Franklin Shaffner's original 1968 film is a classic (yes, classic!).  It holds up very well today and should be seen by anyone who hasn't. The new version has none of the political and social satire that makes the original so fun to watch.  I knew that Mr. Burton wouldn't even attempt a political film, so we are left with a fairly mundane film in which our new time traveler encounters a planet ruled by apes, and then immediatly wants to get the hell out of there.  The problem is there is absolutely no danger.  Mark Wahlberg doesn't face immasculation or lobotomy like Charlton Heston faced in the original. He is only faced with a villain that hates humans, but we never find out why.  Tim Roth is quite good in the role, but we need a backstory. The film does brighten up for a few minutes at the midway point, with a brief cameo.  Let's just say it's the best acting in the film. If we are going to have to sit through remake after remake, please let's try to make a film that is inspired.  Tim Burton is a very original filmmaker, who this time out is hampered by a very poor script. If William Broyles cannot come up with anything more witty than an ape saying ""Get your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty human!"" then perhaps he should start working on that script for ""Apollo 13 Part 2"" What the audience should be saying is ""Keep your stinking paws off of classic movies, you damn stupid producers."" In conclusion, I hope that Tim Burton can find some way to get the ""Batman"" franchise back from Joel Schumacher before he causes any more damage, save Michael Keaton from doing ""Jack Frost 2"" and stop screwing around with classic films from the past. As for Producer Richard Zanuck: PLEASE DON'T REMAKE 'JAWS'or 'THE STING' Leave those films alone for the love of God.

I loved the first Planet of the Ape, though i have yet to see the entier series, I was wondering how they were going to pull this off.  I was very suprised.  The angel that they took was better than i expected.  They didn't go for a ""Remake"" of the original, but took some elements of the first one, and gave a Buton-esq spin on things.  WARNING< SPOLIERS:  The direction of not making the planet Earth was much better.  Knowing that nothing could live up to the orginal, they basicly said ""Screw it"" and gave a whole new origin to the Apes.  Mark Walburge's charecter is very belivable. Unlike Chuck Heston's charecter, Walburge's Leo excepts that apes are in control.  He could care less.  All he wants to do is get out, get this monkey, and go home.  The ape in the movie are also presented more human like than that of the original one.  They are more reminisant of people in the mid to late 1800's as where people were into slavery, those who flet it was wrong, began making their voices heard.  Same as with the Apes.  They felt that Humans where inferior, and thus should be slaves, but then there where those who felt that humans should be free and equal.  Tim Burton was an excelent choice for director.  Though Planet of the Apes was an odd movie for him to make (unlike the genius Sleepy Hollow, which he was born to make)  Burton really makes what he has to work with, work.  The dark theme of the  movie is not the usuall ""Gothic"" dark that Burton has in most of his movies (Edward Sisccor hands, Batman 1 and 2, Bettle juice, Sleepy Hollow)  he gives a dark theme that is some what moody and evil.  My only small problem is that they used the great Chuck Heston on liners, only the Apes said them.  But it was Chuck Heston himself that redeliverd his great ""Damn them, Damn them all to hell"" line, but as an APE!!  I recomend it highly.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Much to my dismay, those days are long gone.""The Mummy Returns"" was an exercise in overkill.  ""Pearl Harbor"" was a tedious bore.  ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Swordfish"" were both so thoroughly awful they don't even merit discussion.  Spielberg's ""A.I."" was a pretentious mish-mash of vague concepts.  And you know things are bad when the usually reliable Disney delivers an uninspired dud like ""Atlantis: The Lost Empire."" Only slightly better were ""The Score"" (buoyed by its actors) and ""Jurassic Park III,"" whose makers were wise enough to give us only 90 minutes of a rapidly tiring novelty.Which brings us to this disgrace.  While I am not a huge fan of the original, I am sure this version is sure to enrage those who are.  The writers of ""Planet of the Apes"" have substituted a series of lame jokes and puns for an actual plot, while subjecting us to a bunch of bland, one-dimensional characters and familiar action sequences.  The incessant screeching and growling of the apes stands as the most annoying redundancy in a film since the depth charges of ""U-571.""  Only the superb make-up by Rick Baker et al. make this film worthy of a one-time viewing.Finally, some thoughts on the director, Tim Burton.  For the life of me I cannot figure out why so many people adore his work.  Yes, I love ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure,"" and the original ""Batman,"" while no masterpiece, is one of the best comic book movies to date.  But his track record of late is atrocious:  ""Sleepy Hollow"" was awful, and until I saw ""Mars Attacks!"" I never thought I'd see Jack Nicholson give a truly bad performance in a film. I will give ""Beetlejuice"" full marks for comedic value and originality, but ""Edward Scissorhands"" is a cheesy sentimentalist abomination.I find it interesting that ""Ed Wood,"" far and away Burton's best film, is the one least remembered or mentioned by his legions of acolytes.  The talent of which he is capable shines through that film, but it appears he has sacrificed it for the allure of big-budget bombast like ""Planet of the Apes.""  Chalk Mr. Burton up as another casualty of Hollywood's war on artistic filmmaking.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Burton usually provides nice twisted stories and wonderful sceneries. But not this time. There is none of crazy of Mars Attacks, and too little of the moodiness of Batman. None of the skilful storytelling of Sleepy Hollow. The apes are wonderful and quite believable, except for their wild jumps. The ape city is fabulous. But the rest is rather bland. And the story sucks big time! It is too predictable, too simple, just done without feeling. If anyone is surprised at the end, I am amazed.The acting is quite OK, Helene Bonham Carter does a wonderful job as an ape. The crazy ape Thade is a lovely psychotic. But the hero is wooden, and the babe unnecessary. The movie had me twisting in my seat wishing certain scenes would end quickly. The logic at the end, when here can choose between staying and being everybody's hero and have at least one human and one ape girl to enjoy himself with, but instead goes off into space and into a storm is just mad. If I were the guy, I would stay and not risk the storm again; never know where it would put me.The one redeeming quality is the few massed scenes were the ape legions leave their city and the attack at the big battle at the end.

I hope my warning will at least keep a few from seeing what they will be disgusted with two and a half hours later. First, the apes are unrealistically strong, and this factor throws the entire main conflict out of proportion making the story that much harder to fathom. Second, the humans can talk, which throws the story far from a Planet of the Apes movie in the first place (this may just be personal preferance). Last, the ending ruined any good coming out of the movie.  Charleton Heston's great scene couldn't even make this movie.  I personally thought this movie not worth the paper that the money I paid to get in was printed on.

I figured it would be a cheesy ripoff of the first, since i already knew it had little to do with the original. i also used to like mark wahlberg in movies like three kings and the perfect storm, but the more i see him in interviews and in public, the more i wished his career died with the funky bunch. however, this movie was a very pleasent surprise. The make up was incredible, especially when you take into consideration the massive cast who all needed to be made into apes. i was also impressed with the way the actors who were portraying the ape characters moved and acted like the real animals. also, i was able to put mark wahlberg's over-all annoying behavior when he's off camera  aside, and really enjoy him in this movie. the only thing i didn't really buy was the relationship between mark wahlberg and estela warren, who plays a very hot slave woman, human of course. towards the end of the movie you get the feeling that there is supposed to be a deep meaningful relationship between them, that simply wasn't built up enough. the only other low point was when mark wahlberg kisses the ape woman who has been helping them. this was supposed to be a very sensitive part of the movie, but the audience on hand that day responded with a resounding ""EEEEWWWWWWW!!!"" One of my friends even yelled, ""GO FOR THE BLONDE!""(Warren) No one laughed at his joke but everyone felt the same way. the best part of this movie was the ending, which i would never give away. but i will say it meets, and nearly outdoes, the original ending. with all of the big summer dissapointments i've seen in the last few months, Planet of the Apes was easily worth the money, do yourself a favor and see it.9/10 stars or if you go by the four star rating: 3 1/2 out of 4","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Mark Wahlberg was also surprisingly bland, as I'd liked him in other dramas and I was about the only female in the audience so I guess he's not that much of a chick draw, though I go to about all sci fi movies anyway.I'm a big fan of Tim Roth but would absolutely never have been able to tell that he was the chief bad guy general without seeing his name in the credits. The ape actors could have been doing voice-overs for animatronics for all the make-up let them emote, which I hadn't felt in the original movie, and Roth's voice really got into the role (he'd turned down the Snapes role in the Harry Potter movie for this?).But sound was the best part of the movie, and it was really loud. Danny Elfman's score was so good, sounding like those Japanese drums a lot of the time, that I paid more attention to the music than to the special effects.(originally written 8/21/2001)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This film has witty dialogue, GREAT special effects, and great ape performances from all. The ""monkeys"" in this version are so much more menacing here that I just may have nightmares. Mark Whalberg's debut into super-stardom is also noteworthy. His mile a minute, never stop attitudes is refreshing and brings his character to life.
I won't go into the story but I will say I didn't think Burton could offer an ending as creative and shocking as the original... but guess what? HE DID IT.... twists and monkeys abound! Go ape and go see it....","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Tim Burton assembled most of the key elements for science fiction success; outstanding makeup, good actors, excellent score, himself directing. But he left out one critical ingredient, a good, tight script. And that omission, in my opinion, sinks the movie. I salute the filmmakers for not wanting a total remake of the original (and better) ""Planet of the Apes"", and that they wanted to put a different spin on the story. And they did, changing many key plot points including the ending. But there are serious problems with the script, among them: (1) Humans speak English, but don't have much to say. There's not even a hint as to why they think they're in the position they're in. (2) The movie has a blatant political/social message that is forced-fit in to key dialogues. (3) The ending is so bad as to be laughable. The makeup alone is worth the price of a rental, but the movie really never takes off. It's certainly not as good as the original.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

God.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511864/?ref_=tt_urv","hmasing","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1286204/?ref_=tt_urv","29 July 2001","This is the movie I have been waiting for 30 years to see, ever since I peeked over the back seat of the station wagon at the drive in theater waiting for Doctor Dolittle (http://us.imdb.com/Title?0061584) to start.  I was five years old, and this was before the days of real ratings.  Besides, the original Apes movie was rated an amazing 'G' as was that other talking animal film we went to see.That said, I was terribly disappointed in the 2001 re-visioning of the 'Planet of the Apes'.  Tim Burton is one of my favorite cutting-edge directors, and Danny Elfman a top composed.  The cast looks excellent - on paper, but in reality the characters are mainly one dimensional and shallow. The possible exception is Helena Bonham Carter as Ari, who at least seemed to have fun playing a rather muppet-like Chimp/Human rights activist. Burton didn't dare go anywhere but the obvious places, and even with the attempt at a surprise twist ending (which left me slack jawed at the sheer disconnectedness of it).  There were so many opportunities to build these characters in an otherwise visually stunning universe.  Would it be bestiality for two sapient members of different species to actually explore their apparent sexual tension that Burton was trying to portray?  Could it have been possible for Daena (Estella Warren) to do anything other than pine and heave her fur-bikinied breasts about?  There was a real opportunity to explore something here that Burton ignored.  And Burton usually hits these on the head.The first ape line of the film made me dread what was an otherwise decent start to the movie.  I won't reveal what it is, but it was too obvious an attempt to try to a) make you laugh, b) set the tone of the film, and c) nod to the original film.Overall, I give this film a 3 out of 10 for an overall impression.  I give Rick Baker a 10 out of 10 for an AMAZING bunch of creatures.  I give Mark Wahlberg (Capt. Leo Davidson) a -2 out of 10 for mailing in his performance and avoiding any sort of commitment to his role.  Helena Bohnam Carter (Ari) gets a 7 out of 10 for her role, and Tim Roth (General Thade) gets 8 out of 10 for being a peeved chimpanzee and a vicious character, and making me truly dislike him.  Or was it the complete shallowness of his character that I hated?  Wait, I give Tim Roth an 8, and I subtract two points from Tim Burton for not allowing such a fine villain to have any depth for a total Tim Burton score of 3 out of 10.  Visually, the film gets 8 out of 10 from me.Nutshell summary:  A mediocre attempt worth seeing for the makeup and soundtrack, and for the uncomfortable laugh at the end when you realize how much Hollywood is spending to produce crap these days.  This film is definitely worth a rental, but save yourself the $8.50 to see it in the theater.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Some people thought it was boring but they are just petty minded simpletons who went to see a horror/action film which is more like the originals and don't understand anything outside that. Don't go expecting more of the originals, like Burton said, it's not a remake, more of a rehash.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

By itself it makes a reasonable action sci-fi but falls far short from the great originals. Although it does try to make a statement of some kind, it is far too obviously and shallowly done. The characters were also a let down, being quite one dimensional.That said, however, should the movie be judged by it's own merits, and not seen in the shadow of the original Planet of the Ape movies, it does deserve some credit as far as entertainment is concerned. It follows a good, exciting and 'non-stagnating' plot, and the viewer remains interested throughout.Overall; a nice try but should not have tried to follow in the foot-steps of the originals.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was sent on TV and I thought like "" I am going to die along with the movie runtime "" but it was really good. So therefore I thought that Planet of the Apes Redux, or whatever one calls it, would be fun to see. And when I read Tim Burton had directed the whole thing I was even more excited. Edward Scissorhands- director doing a redux of one of the true movie classics, is that great or not.So I saw the movie and I was delighted to see how the masks had got even more realistic. And we also had Mark Wahlberg performing quite good, but alas he did not prove to be better than old Heston of the original. Helena Bonham Carter as sweet ape Ari was perfect for the role but this human-beings-seller in green? A typical sidekick, and I have never liked sidekicks. He has these spot-on comments to the movie's happenings but this true "" evil ape empire ""-feeling at once gets toned down by this fellow.
Tim Roth plays evil ape general Thade, the ultimate bad guy, breathing a little bit like Darth Vader in Star Wars. Michael Clarke Duncan have been showing off for the Apes- posters, so naturally he plays a great role as armyleader Attar. I have now seen the movie three times, one time on cinema, two times on VHS and I can't still figure out how the ending was like.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Do not see this movie if you enjoy good acting and a great story.  But if you have the mind of a 12-year-old boy, you'll probably enjoy yourself.  The movie was not as stylized as other Tim Burton movies.  And I use the word movie as opposed to film.Most of the characters in this movie are two dimensional cardboard cut outs. There is not one character who we get to know with any depth.  This is a major flaw of the movie.  Because the audience really doesn't care about what happens to anyone of them.  I suppose that some people would believe that the audience's loyalty it is built in - since the audience is human and we would naturally root for our own kind.However, in the original we get to know Cornelius and Zira and therefore cared about what happened to them, even though they are chimpanzees.It both helps and hurts to have seen the original.  It helps, because you a familiar with the background, you don't need to have things explained to you.  However, it hurts because you will inevitably compare the two works - the 2001 version failing in almost ever respect to a comparison of the first.Watching the two will only make a person realize how little acting and directing talent there is out there today.  Some might say, the past is not better, it was just different.  That would be ridiculous. No objective observer,  looking at the acting talent in the first one, (Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowall, James Whitmore, Kim Hunter, Maurice Evans), could argue that today's version, with its cast, is actually a better movie.  Even the mute Linda Harrison character Nova, said more with her eyes and facial expressions, than the updated Daena (Estella Warren) with all her lines of dialog.  Charlton Heston's death bed scene (as Gen. Thade's father) is about the only real piece of dramatic acting in the whole movie (2001).  Although, to his credit, Paul Giamatti's Limbo character does provide some nice comic relief throughout the 2001 version.In the original, we had political, social and cultural commentary.  Today's version has very little.   When it does attempt to offer some, it is so brief and mealy-mouthed in its delivery that it only serves to weaken the picture.That's the real weakness of this movie.  It doesn't know whether it wants to be gritty and dark or light and campy.  All to often, it falls into the latter category, hurting its otherwise fine production values.  (Quite unlike some other Tim Burton movies). It rates 5 out of 10 stars.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Then, even though the highly trained human pilot crashes not once, but twice, we are expected that the chimp pilot experiences none of the same problems and can land his pod without difficulty.  Why does a cute chimp landing in a space craft make the apes suddenly believe that the humans aren't so bad after all?Then there's the stupid ""suprise"" ending.  The whole movie is based on the premise that the smart apes evolved from genetic engineered apes that crash landed on the planet with the humans.  So why are we supposed to suddenly believe that Leo would crash land in a second parallel world where Washington D.C. looks just like ours, but everybody is an ape instead of a human?

Leo (Mark Wahlberg) does not care for any of human on the planet of the apes but himself. His goal was just get himself out of the planet as soon as possible. The director knows too well that he is not a hero, that's why he decided to add a scene of heroic rescue of a young boy in the movie. But it doesn't help to make him a better character but too obvious of an effort. Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) was a confusing idealistic character that she believes ape and human should be equally live together. But the movie fails to show her feeling when she watches human killing her own kind. Instead of an internal struggle inside her, she just blindly help human beat up her own people. And the third main character, Daena (Estella Warren) she was just a pretty figure follows Leo everywhere until the end. It's not her fault that she couldn't act, it's the movie doesn't give her any chance to act. It was a failure when Leo farewells to Ari and Daena in the end, there's nothing there to drive the audiences to any feeling. It's as if we watch some stranger say goodbyeThey could have brought up much more than this. They could use the scene when Ari heard about how human treat Apes on Earth (lock in the zoo) as an ironic moral in the movie. But they didn't go further Everyone agree that the makeup in this movie is awesome. There's no doubt about that.

It occurs to me that this film wouldn't exist without the Charlton Heston version and its sequels. Imagine if Franklin Schaffner had never adapted Pierre Boule's novel. Do you suppose that now someone would still come along and say, hey, that would make a good movie? Actually let me re-phrase that: would that make a movie ANYONE would be interested in seeing? Not likely. So having seen Tim Burton's newly 're-imagined' ""Planet of the Apes,"" am I glad there was an original whos coat-tails it could ride? Well, it's not terrible. At times it's downright interesting. Ultimately, though, it's just unnecessary. But that doesn't mean you can't enjoy it as long as it's around. Like any Burton film, this one is about escape. It transports you to another place and time. The sets, the makeup, the effects all work hard to create this temporary reality. It's convincing but, visually, I was hoping for something more like ""Sleepy Hollow."" I was never amazed by anything in ""Apes"" but was stunned by some of the things Burton and his crew accomplished on such previous films as ""Sleepy Hollow"" and ""Batman."" ""Apes"" seemed like fertile ground for the same visual opportunities, but Burton doesn't make good. At best, he's made the kind of cheesy sci-fi he poked fun at in ""Mars Attacks."" The irony! This didn't look or feel like a Tim Burton film at all. Where is the weird coolness that creeps into every single shot? Think of ""Batman,"" how it more than overcame that horrid script with Palance and Nicholson, along with Burton's twisted vision of Gotham City. And where did the humor go? Burton picks NOW to get serious? THIS film? I mean, if this was the best he was going to do with ""Planet of the Apes,"" he should have just stuck his name on it as producer and let some up-and-comer direct (actually, that will happen with the inevitable sequel, er, sequels). Not even Tim Burton can save us from Summer 2001, a film lover's nightmare.

The acting was second rate at best, characters were so predictable, and the plot so thin that I was about ready to get up and leave 1/2 way through the movie.  How many of you out there actaully managed to predict the movies ending at about the half way point???  And the Ka Li Ma thing?  Makes you think they ripped that off from Star Trek when the spacecraft came looking for ""v y ger"".Absolutley no premise was given to the scientific background that would make such a series of events possible.  Not just the time shift but the whole evolution of monkeys into something more.  If in the thousadn years or so that the monkeys had become dominate then why had the humans not also changed?  Wouldnt the humans be a lot smaller and dumber?  And all the perfect teath in the movie?If you have to see it wait for the video to go into the $.99 special of the week section.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie is lifeless and dull for the first hour as apes sit around discussing human rights.The New Planet of the Apes lacks the mystery and intrigue and character the first movie had and only decided to capitalize on the fact that Apes can talk. The ending is a ridiculous mess too that only sets up a sequel possibility. This movie is garbage and you should spend your time watching the original instead.

The original premise was so silly that I thought if there is one movie that did NOT cry out to be remade it was this one. I was incorrect in assuming this. The prosthetic makeup is so much better than the original(you can see the actor's real faces beneath the ape facade)that the biggest hurdle is immediately overcome. Tim Burton excels in working unusual concepts in his film and this is more of the same. Mark Wahlberg fits as the protagonist and while he is not Laurence Olivier the material isn't Shakespeare either. I went expecting little and was pleasantly surprised. With people staying away from the theatre in droves this summer I don't think the film will do that well in the box office but I will recommend it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I also learned that somehow, apes just learned to talk on their own, a lot like evolving, but maintained their hunched appearance and brutish looks.  You couldn't call the original series science fiction, because it wasn't really based on science.  In fact, in order to really enjoy any of the original films, you had to forgive a lot of fuzzy logic.This new ""revisioning"" of the original film makes a whole lot more sense of how apes learned to talk and walk upright and possess all those ""human"" qualities without having any overt explanation scene.  It just makes sense on its own if you really think about it.  You don't have to though.Anyway, Mark Wahlberg proves again that he was never supposed to be a hip hop star and acts his way very effectively through this pretty darned intelligent film.  First off, leave it to Tim Burton to make comedic yet emotionally trying jabs at bestiality.  If you see the film, you'll see what I mean.  Secondly, we see how operatic life in politics can be, and still be fun.Tim Roth leads a tremendous supporting cast of action movie veterans.  Of course, you won't recognize any of them through the amazing make-up.  The action is amazing, and artfull while the story moves at a locomotive pace.
Honestly, this movie never stops.  And we all expected a big twist ending, better than the original, but instead, we get a twist ending with such a huge sequel come-on that I almost vomitted.  The ending manages to work, come out of left field, and tickle you pink, all at once.  I was either elated or nauseous, I can't decide.  Overall, a really good film.  Better than the original, possibly.  The 68 classic had no limitations as to how high morally it could reach.  So this new revisioning decides to change gears.  Don't walk in expecting a social commentary.  Walk in expecting a summer rollercoaster ride with a seemingly infinite shelf life.  Your grandkids will be asking you if you actually saw it in the theater.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

What he did was ""re-imagine"" it into the dud of the year. I don't want to spend a lot of time comparing it to the original, but it's nowhere near as good as the original. During the first 45 minutes, I was partially impressed. There was some great makeup and a few decent dialogue scenes. But as soon as Wahlberg and company escaped, it was all downhill. Once the battle scene came I was rolling my eyes and laughing. The action was pretty boring compared to some of Burton's better films. The last 20 minutes just drag on and on. And what was the deal with Tim Roth's performance? He spent the whole time growling and trying to act scary. To me it came off as a bad impression of Mr. Furious from Mystery Men. There were some genuinely entertaining moments, I'll give it that. Charlton Heston's cameo being the high point. But I spent most of the movie waiting for it to end. I found the original Planet Of The Apes to be an intelligent movie. It had great themes on the relationship and treatment between Humans and Animals. And while Tim Burton does play on those themes in the early parts of this film, it loses all sight of it in exchange for a load of action sequences.I'm sure that there is an audience for Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes. I'm just not part of that audience. Just like Psycho, Planet of the Apes is a film better off not being remade.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Mark Wahlberg surely was not the best choice for the protagonist. Take a look at old Heston in 1968, he did a great job. He's a leader, a strong man with authority. Mark Wahlberg lacks those charisma. Compared to Heston he looks really poor - a half-grown boy trying to command. The rest of the film looks like a more or less solid film. But Tim Burton likes to show some weird things in his films, but this time it made a medium film worse. I am talking about the unrealistic end of the film (!!!). In my eyes it was not logic and useless.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Unlike the 1968 film version with Charlton Heston, this film retains (an Americanized version of) the original ending, which actually works pretty well. There are good scenes along the way too, but somehow, the story just doesn't quite make it. Excellent performances by Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth shore it up a bit, as does the superb make-up. In the end, though, poorish special effects, unmemorable music, and a seeming indecision on the part of the filmmakers as to whether to stick with the original story or write one of their own mean this movie just doesn't work as it should. Watch it by all means, but a classic it is not.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I am thoroughly disgusted by this- he has clearly fallen for the Hollywood method of fearlessly distributing crap, so long as he makes a buck (or a million). DON'T see this trashy, stupid, waste-of-time movie. Mark Wahlberg's acting is totally sub-par and boring. The rest of the characters are background filler and serve no purpose.

Unfortunately, I was very much unimpressed with what I viewed. The special effects were great, the scenery was realistic, and the cast seemed to be very talented (opinion not based on this movie). However, they were lacking in one MAJOR department: the script! As someone said before, I agree that you and a bunch of your friends could have written a better screenplay for the movie than these talented, well-paid writers did.There were many interesting directions this movie *could* have taken and didn't. I noticed that in the beginning of the movie, the woman scientist on the spaceship mentions that with chimps the female is dominant sexually. Of course, this led me to think; `What an interesting twist to the movie! The female apes could be really domineering instead of the males!' But instead the comment seemed to hold no relevancy to the rest of the film whatsoever! It turns out there were hardly any female apes at all, and those were hardly very aggressive.Maybe I shouldn't have gone to see the movie with such high hopes for a great flick, but I did. I am officially insulted at spending good money on a film that seemed to have lots of possibility but no delivery. For those of you who haven't seen the movie and plan to, my advice to you is to go into the movie with lowered expectations and maybe you'll appreciate it more than I did.5 out of 10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The lifelike and varied ape makeup, combined with the effort that has gone into making the apes... well, apes, and more individual than the oppressed humans can manage to be, makes their society utterly believable. Helena Bonham Carter delicately brings out the character of Ari, shewing us that a full face prosthesis need not handicap a great actress, and Tim Roth camps it up completely as Thade (which you may not think is a good point).On to the bad parts. Mark Wahlberg does nothing to arouse my sympathy, or indeed interest. It doesn't help that his character is halfway between James T Kirk and Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz, and does not develop at all throughout the film. The plot is stupid, ridiculous and yet utterly predictable, and forces characters to act unrealistically. The eventual resolution is contrived and unsatisfying, it gives no extra depth to anything, in fact, it seems to be the only way the writers could think of to finish off the plot. The ending is tacked-on and inconsistent.I would recommend avoiding this film unless you really have nothing better to do, and no expectations of intelligence.

Don't stop reading because I mention Star Trek.  Here goes: (One thing you have to know first, when Mark goes through this storm in space, he thinks he is taken to another planet, when he is really taken to another time on his). If you remember, when he was crash-landing on the ""other planet"" (Earth), his digital calendar was moving the years ahead very quickly.  He was going into the future.  The space-station he came from was pulled in too but not at the same time as him.  The space-station got pulled into a time 1,000's of years before him.  That space-station was carrying many genetically enhanced chimps.  When that station landed (crashed), the apes got out, killed the humans and populated the planet.  Since, Mark was sent to a time ahead of that, the apes had already evolved (genetically enhanced).  So, they evolved.  Remember, this is Earth.  Remember that at the end when Mark locks the General in that room he doesn't kill him.  So, after Mark leaves to go back to what he thinks is his planet, but is really another time, the General escapes and still has his armies so he exterminates the humans.  Mark goes through the time portal and really instead of going to what he thinks is Earth, he goes ahead in time even farther, to where the apes have evolved into a society like ours.  The statue (Abraham Lincoln) is of the General because he saved the planet for the apes (by exterminating the humans).","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Visually the make-up is generally impressive  the overall effect of seeing so many simian humanoids at once is quite overpowering, even if most of the set-design is pretty unimaginative.
Tim Roth's performance as a sort of Richard III ape is perhaps the most memorable  his strangulated restless manner is reminiscent of the mortally wounded Mr Orange in Reservoir Dogs (although he wasn't a monkey). Bonham Carter is also impressive in a decisive departure from her flowery Merchant Ivory image. Only the make-up lets her down  her visage seems to have been tampered with in an ultimately futile attempt to make her look her like an attractive ape. This fails. On the other hand, Estella Warren's Daena is far too much like a supermodel to look like a convincing native girl.So why does Planet of the Apes fail? Here are some ideas.1) Why do the humans on the planet speak? In the original film and the novella there was a direct human-apes reversal situation  the humans could not speak or communicate anymore effectively than monkeys can on Earth. That was why the arrival of Heston's character stirred the waters. Here the humans are clearly ruled over by the apes, but given their supposed mastery of technology' which the apes lack, there seems no real reason why the apes should be so dominant. Burton seems to be striving for a civil rights parallel. Roth's ape even misquotes the reactionary Senator Barry Goldwater at one point. But this paradox still makes little sense.2) Too much of the dialogue is banal or just stupid. There are a number of signs the film is rushed.3) The comedy' orang-utan is annoying. 4) Wahlberg is no action hero. He got away with it playing a porn actor but not here. 5) The ending seems to be an attempt to echo that of the novella. Yet that made sense. This one doesn't. It is not clever, just inexplicable. I HEREBY DEFY ANYONE ON THESE PAGES TO EXPLAIN THE ENDING SATISFACTORILY! It's impossible - it's nonsensical.Overall, not a disaster, but highly disappointing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You've got extremely dark and stylish director Tim Burton paired back up with scoring buddy Danny Elfman. Cool ape costumes and Marky Mark out in front. How could any of this go wrong you ask? Well, it does.Now, don't get me wrong, I did like this movie. That was until the last ten minutes of the film. The ending is so ridiculous that it cause the rest of the movie to make NO SENSE at all. The ending is terrible and I cannot express enough how much sense it does not make! I'm not going to give anything away, but you aren't missing anything life-changing. The movie was good, except for this contrived and senseless plot twist that is completely tacked-on.Besides the fact that the movie ends up not making any sense after it was on the right track, the musical score, I hear, had to be completely redone mere days before release. So, the new score has no resemblance of Danny Elfman at all. It's your generic action movie score. Thanks, studio executives! That's why you guys collect the money to back the film and you leave the movie-making to the movie makers! What an original concept.I don't need to go into the story or the plot, you know it. The only thing you don't know about is the new ending, which causes the whole movie to be worthless. Oh, and did I mention that there is no resemblance of Tim Burton's style anywhere? Then I'll say it here: nada on the Burton style.I was really, really excited about seeing this movie. I really was.

I laughed where I'm sure you're not supposed to laugh (although most people did). But if you can get past the cheese, and just kick back and let your imagination flow for a while, this is a really good movie. The monkeys.. sorry apes, are not just ordinary humans that look like apes, they have their own culture and ways. There's alot of aggression and sexual tension between them, and things boil down to who's the strongest. I liked all the twists, the last one being a predictable one, but it can still tickle your imagination, if you let it. So, I say open your eyes and ears and go see it. There are not a whole lot of movie out there that works from beginning til end, if you compare them and their plots to real life.

I had a fun night out! I mean, what did you expect from Mr. Glorious (Tim Burton for others...)? The lesson I have learned a long time ago is: Expect the Unexpected. So is it this bad just to make a film for people to entertain? And entertained I was. The script could've been better, the make-up less like the Jacksons and so forth. But all they wanted to do is tell a story the old-fashioned way, by just telling it. I mean, we all know the philosophical backgrounds since 1968, no need in going into them too deeply again.The ending, the ending... I thought it was really brave what they did. They new, they couldn't top the original one. Leaving so many things in the dark by simply not telling them might for some be inacceptable. For me, it was a bold fresh breeze in the mainstream-movie-business.To all those bickering about the ending being ""illogical"":(for those, who want to get into it stone-cold, please stop reading!) Do you really need an explanation for everything? Just accept the fact, that it happend that way. The film doesn't explain how, just THAT it happend. With all the Time-Jumping around, there are loads of ways the ending works perfectly well. Just use your own imagination! For all those who disagree please send a Mail.

I won't talk about the little amounts of acting because i blame that on the writing. I won't get into the details because, like i said, they are murky at best. This is a two hour effects powerhouse except that when you look under the hood for the engine you realize what's running the show is a bunch of monkeys.  THe movie fell short in too many areas for me and the cool monkey outfits and such could not overcome this.  There were more plot holes than in a slice of Swiss cheese and each and every hole was a dark, endless one. Spinning you deeper into a vast array of nonsense and excuses to get Marki Mark to his next ordeal with the monkeys.  I would only recommend this movie to those who love completely mindless action movies and for big fans of Marky Mark walking around breathing heavy and doing nothing much else.   Other than that i would not recommend this to my worst enemy.  It was a formulaic mess and a shameless attempt at using a classic story that has become part of our culture to make money and make the hollywood big-wigs smile a little wider and their wallets a little fatter. 
Kudos to them because as i've read now that the movie grossed 70 million over the weekend.  They made the perfect, mindless fodder that thousands of kids go screaming to the theaters to watch. They'll think the apes are cool and Marky Mark is cool and in the end that's all that matters.  In the end Tim Burton, whom i once cherished as a director, will be regarded as a master mind.  Why?  Perhaps you should look under the hood and ask him yourself as he tosses your oil filter out and makes a bigger mess.  ""Hey Tim!

I remember it being meaningful, instead of this new-age ""save the little people"" approach that try to teach us animal rights and how humans are cruel and unpredictable.Let me just get this out in the open, the ending sucked.  Sure it was a surprise, but it made no sense and it forces a sequel to explain it.  I would've enjoyed it better if it was more like the original (and not the book).If you've seen the original, it's nothing like this version.  He lands by himself and is quickly thrown into the conflict.  A minor change (that I wasnt expecting, actually) was that he could talk as soon as he landed, where in the original it took Heston a while to talk.  Dr. Zaius is back, thrown in a comedic role thus losing the serious role he had back in the original.  Again, it's just a matter of taste.  If you want a reved up, updated classic...this is the movie for you.Something has always bothered me.  It was in the original and in this one as well (I dont know if it's the same in the book as well), but why doesnt the main character get that HOT human chick?  He seems more interested in that female monkey!  Sheesh, Estella Warren is very VERY hot, and she's a Canadian as well! ;)  That chick from the original was hot too, but she's like 4 000 years old now... :(The effects were there, the musical score was there...the plot and development of characters was not.

The acting by the human-played apes was marvelous, mannerisms such as hoots and grunts in amusement, anger, or excitement were quite well done.  Burton was also able to create a scientifically logical theory behind the concept, engineering the thought that the primates were tampered with in the human image, and taught English when they were genetically engineered, which all of course was fantastical but eerily plausible.  The ape culture was intriguing as well.There was moments where I was saying, ""Wow, that was a really great idea"".  However, there was also times when I found myself saying, ""Jesus Burton, not that!"", although the latter was less common.
All throughout his career, Tim Burton was trying as hard as he could to balance entertainment with his cinematic vision, and this time he struck gold.
All in all, Planet of the Apes is not the kind of remake that people who loathe action films would enjoy, nor people who despise art films, but if you have no preference (Or you can at least stand both), the new Planet of the Apes is truly great science fiction! My only complaints were the blonde supermodel (Paper thin character), and some really lame dialogue(More character developement would have been nice too).  Both a B movie and a cinematic marvel (If it's possible).Ah, and on a final note, Helena Bonham Carter (the period-piece-princess) made a rather attractive chimpanzee!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I say this because there are two things I've noticed: One, the line in the trailer ""Bring me the space man!"" is omitted. Two, there is not one, but two big plot twists in the film. The first one is cool and works well, the other is HORRIBLE. Burton, if this was your fault, you are an idiot. If it was Fox's fault, all you studio execs are idiots.The similarities between the original and the Burton films are few. There's the forbidden zone, there's a quick cameo of Dr. Zeus (ever so briefly, you have to be looking for him in the background). There's a bigger cameo of Charlton Heston as General Thade's father, also saying the like ""Damn them! Damn them all to hell!"" which brought on cheers in the crowd. There's also the first line between Marky Mark and an ape: ""Get your hand off me you damn dirty human!"" which wasn't received so well.The main plot twist was a good adaptation of the original, and perhaps a bit more realstic. However the second one brought on ""boo's"" from the crowd. People were really p***ed off at it. I won't give it away here, but let's just say that the other 99.9% of the film BARELY makes up for how bad this ending is.Tim Roth as Thade was INCREDIBLE. He stole the show. He was evil incarnate, and I'd watch the movie again just for him (and then I'll walk out of the theater right before the crappy ending).9/10, would have been a 10 but minus 1 for the ending.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It combines a new adaptation to the familiar story of the original. However, it is by no means a remake.  The new movie has some very striking similarities, but is a new and different film.  This ""Planet of the Apes"" uses enough of the now famous content, that made the original great, to sell it to the older fans, as well as a new story to win over a younger generation which would not properly understand the social gripping message of the 60's version.  This film is clearly Tim Burton's best work.  The cast does a very good job, especially considering all of the makeup.  Charlton Heston steals the show as Gen. Thade's father, proving once again that no one does a ""Planet of the Apes"" film like Mr. Heston. Despite the overall excellent nature of this film, it is flawed in one major aspect.  This film has no star quality.  No offense to Mark Wahlberg, but he is not capable of carrying a summer blockbuster by himself.  Mr. Wahlberg is a fine up and coming actor, but he has not yet reached the point in his career (and maybe never will) where he can open a film by himself, let alone a major film such as ""Planet of the Apes"".  Wahlberg tries his best to play the reluctant hero, but the key word is ""tries"".  He lacks the major presence that Charlton Heston provided in the original.  Wahlberg is unable to sell himself as an ""action star"".  His lines are not believable, and are quite commonplace.  In order for such a film to have been properly done it would have required a big time action star.  That star could only have been Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose name was mentioned for the Wahlberg role. His presence in the film would have made a big summer hit into a mega summer blockbuster.

Bravo! Boy, are they ""mad, bad, and dangerous to know.""Planet of The Apes is one of several movies that I earmarked to see this summer season. It is the first that did not disappoint...in fact it actually exceeded my expectations.  Let's get something straight, right off the bat, I did not go to the theater expecting to be enlightened. I went to be entertained and Planet of the Apes is extremely entertaining. The costumes and makeup are first rate. Rick Baker should, deservedly so, garner another Oscar for his work. The apes are REAL...more real than the dinosaurs in the disappointing Jurassic Park 3. The actors were great. Tim Roth is menacingly elegant as General Thade. Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary Tagawa are excellent in the student/sensei roles. Helena Bonham Carter...ah well, is it me or does she actually look and perform better as an ape?  Paul Giamatti almost steals the movie as the human slave trader, Limbo. The human actors were...well...human.  The movie isn't called Planet of The Humans is it?I'm a fan of the first Planet Of The Apes. This film is as good in some parts and much, much better in others. Go see the movie, sit back and enjoy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

No, it is not perfect, neither was the original. This one was very exciting to watch. The film is always visually interesting. The CGI work is top notch. The battle action is suspenseful, and the apes running along side the horses is unworldly.  Most actors did very well, under what must have been very heavy makeup. A successful re imagining of the original. The hero came off a little like ""Gladiator"" meets the planet of the Apes. No problem here. The twist at the end was a good one.

Costumes, art direction, special effects are amazing! Great part of the success of this film is due to the wonderful make-up effects by the genial wizardy of Rick Baker and the complex score composed by the talent of the sublime Maestro Danny Elfman.

""Planet of the Apes"" is much like ""Batman"" or ""Sleepy Hollow"" in that respect.  You know what you're getting, but not sure of how it's going to be told, or what surprises lie along the way.This is ""B movie"" fun at its finest.  Of course, you're dealing with a film about talking monkeys, so if you're going into this film expecting something overtly serious, you're not going to find it.  It's a very surreal film, both in its ideas and in watching the human-like apes, swing, beat their chests, ride horses, and carry on conversations.  It's fascinating and a little scary at the same time.  Burton's quirky sense of humor is definitely apparent in the ape cities.  The make-up in this film is great, especially the gorilla soldiers.  The actor cameos are fun to spot (Watch for Heston - Burton does a good job in paying homage to the original series), and the twist in meaning of the original film's dialogue is definitely worth a laugh or two.The story was an interesting take on the original series.  At times it was silly (and seems aware of this), but not necessarily in an unpleasant way. The biggest problem that I had with the story was in the resolution (I thought a lot of the conflict issues were too neatly and conveniently tied up).    Burton also did a nice job providing a new spin on the classic film's infamous ""Statue of Liberty"" scene.  There definitely seems to be plans in the works for a sequel by the way it ended.I think this film will get some criticism for what it is, but you know, this isn't the type of film that is going to teach you something about yourself, nor will it provide the solution to all the world's problems by the time the end credits roll.  I had fun with this.  It was wild, it was campy, the acting performances were good for this type of film, and the special effects were entertaining.  I enjoyed this film for what it set out to do, and I'm glad it's not simply a rehash of the original film.Burton has still been unable to let me down, and still remains one of my favorite directors.  I'll definitely add this to my ""Burton DVD"" collection.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The actors, I feel gave great performances and were very convincing as apes, however, the story line was poorly developed. In the original POTA films, there were hundreds of apes that looked exactly alike, so although you knew their names it was hard to distinguish each ape. In 2001 POTA, Rick Baker did a wonderful job of creating a wide variety of apes with very different physical features, however, most were never called by their names. Even the human's name were not mentioned so although you could tell them apart, who were they? I feel that this film is worthy of a sequel, if for no other reason than the performance of Tim Roth as General Thade who needed a female in the worst way. I believe that if a sequel is made, Tim Burton will redeem himself or at least I hope so.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

He must have been asleep during the part where his character points out to Carter's female ape character, that ""...we are not alike, you care about everybody else but yourself.""  For me, this whole statement defines the movie. He only wants to go home.  He only cares about himself.  And all without the arrogant 'attitude' we're used to seeing in movies.  It's either Look at me I'm cool, or Look at me I'm a hero, Wahlberg's character and final decision in the movie pave the way for turning upside down everything you ever thought you knew about what's really going on.  A perfect sci-fi where the seemingly explainable goes unexplained.The plausibility of the opening year at 2029?  A stretch...only if you believe we're in the same reality, which you will find out becomes one for the X-files.   The original 1968 movie left you with a shock, so you could figure out the timeline and the ape evolution.  This movie doesn't try to shock, as many are thinking it's supposed to.  It's actually supposed to make you THINK who came first, human or ape?  You will realize that you would have never reached this point if Wahlberg walked the path of the true hero.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Casting Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth as the lead chimps allowed for Oscar-caliber performances, though I doubt the Academy will award a sci-fi remake (lol). Moreover, Tim Roth is sort of reminiscent of Roddy McDowell while Mark Wahlberg is the same of Charlton Heston (who appears as Thade's father, a cameo in the tradition of casting the original players of a franchise). Moreover, Paul Giamatti's orang utan character Limbo, a slave-trader, plays well to the crowd as an excellent source of comic relief.The origin of the apes and the movie's exposition gel well, despite the downpour of negativity from the so-called critics. Hints to the origin pop up in the exposition with such examples as the female scientist announcing a role that the pivotal chimp character, Pericles, is to undertake (I'll keep that role hush-hush).As for the setting, die-hard cult fans of the original films will not be disappointed. While the film is being marketed as happening on another planet rather than a post-apocalyptic Earth, there is a scene in the movie that plays to the original. In other words, Burton didn't mess much with his adaptation, only changing minor details as he had done with ""Batman"" in 1989.Finally, for those cynics who like to pass science-fiction off as superficial, this movie offers up a taste of abolition, reversing the roles of ""dominant"" and ""submissive,"" much like what was done in the film ""White Man's Burden,"" starring John Travolta as a white inferior to a rich Harry Bellafonti. It even shows how children are affected by slavery, in ways such as Limbo giving a human child to Thade's little daughter because she wanted a pet.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's a re-telling of the story.  And please look up the word ""re-make"", which in the context of ""filmmaking"", means ""to make a film using the same story as that of an old film"".  To expand on that definition, it's means that in that same story, all the same characters are used like that of the original story, and the script is, more or less, the same.  Examples of true re-makes include Sabrina and Psycho.  POTA (2001) is not a re-make, because Mark Wahlberg's character was Leo Davidson, not Col. George Taylor.  If 2001's version was supposed to be a re-make, you would see Tim Burton use the same characters, but he did not. So it not a re-make.  Please stop comparing.  Comparing 2001's POTA to 1968's POTA, is like comparing Tim Burton's Batman (1989) to 1966's Batman: The Movie!!!!!!  They are not the same!!!!!!!!  That's sound ridiculous!!!!!The title for both films are the same, but that's it...the plot is different, the characters are different....stop comparing....My review of Tim Burton's POTA is very positive.  I was very impressed with this film.  POTA (2001) was one of a few films I was willing to go see in a theatre this year, and I was not disappointed.  Kudos to Burton and the cast and crew of POTA (2001).  No need to make people understand the film, if they can't use their own heads.  GO SEE POTA (2001) TODAY WITH AN OPEN MIND if you haven't seen it yet...OR SEE IT AGAIN, SO YOU WILL SEE THINGS YOU MISSED THE FIRST TIME AROUND, and enjoy it even more, like I did!!!Can't wait for the DVD for this one!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

He's gasping for air in nearly every scene, even after he walks a short distance.  Take a look for yourself.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This isn't just ""let's shoot the same movie all over again with different actors"", it's actually a fairly different take on the same material.  The basic concept remains the same, but it's most definitely a different movie.One of the most noticeable differences is in the apes themselves.  They're a great deal more bestial, athletic and...well, ape-like than their 1968 counterparts.  Charlton Heston was threatened by the apes because they had guns.  Mark Wahlberg is threatened by the apes because they are, as one might rightly expect, much more than a physical match for a human.  I did miss the caste system that ruled the simian society in the original, but that probably has more to do with the script overall being much less allegorical than Rod Serling's 1968 screenplay.Mark Wahlberg is an appealing enough hero, though there's not really much of a character to play.  Tim Roth is, as always, a terrific villain and probably the most convincing of any of the apes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I don't know why people think the script is bad.  I thought the ending was better than the original because Leo, unlike Taylor is in immediate danger.  If it doesn't make sense to some of you, why don't you take time to interpret?  Remember, the ship Thade gets stuck in may still be of help to him.  I don't want to give away my interpretation of the ending, you people better start thinking for yourselves.  All I could say is you can't forget that time travel is very possible in this movie. Both this POTA and BTTF have their main characters find something changed when they get back their times.  I like the adrenaline-pumping plot.  The dabbling of humor in it also helps. It dips just enough into the animal-human relations(and relations within the same species) to prevent distorting the plot. OK, it's not possible for Thade and Ari to speak with British accents if their ancestors learned English from Americans but who cares about small mistakes like that?","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Unlike the original movie, this one leaves you with a lot more questions. At the end of the original, we realized that he was on earth after all. Simple as that. But this movie leaves me with so many questions that I am counting down the days till the next one is released. I compare the ending of this movie to that of the original Star Wars.....abrupt. But I did indeed enjoy the movie, for several reasons. One was the great special effects and terrific Make-up and Costume usage. (Give em the Oscars now). I had to keep reminding myself there were humans under all that make-up. I didnt care too much for the beginning, it just seemed a little far-fetched, like this might have been the best idea out of a bunch of bad ideas on how to begin the film. Man risks life for monkey? As it went on, we saw the viciousness of General Thade and wondered ""Whats up his butt""? Although thoroughly p***ed off the entire movie, Thade does display a side of him that is very human. His scene with Heston as his father bleeds with politics, because the one possesion he has of the humans is a gun, and considering its Heston, Pres of the NRA, I couldnt concentrate on what they said to each other, because I was chuckling at the Irony of this scene. Heston saying humans are dangerous for creating this kind of technology? Did I hear that right? Wow...... We have all heard of movies that are too slow. This one went too fast. I wanted more explanations, and more about the apes...the general daily life of these apes is hardly delved into, and we go into the sequels knowing very little about them, except they dont like humans and they screech a lot. The ending did leave a lot of doors open for sequels, but will this movie go down as being better than the original? Probably not. Will this movie be remembered for its stunning visual images? Yes. And thats why you should see it. Dont get too entangled in the plot...because you will be tangled for a while. Enjoy the movie, and wait for the sequels to explain what we dont know.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I got the general impression that this movie was a waste of time. Yes, Estella Warren spent the entire movie uselessly pouting with those inappropriately glossed lips.  Yes, Mark Wahlberg was not nearly as dynamic and emotional as would be expected for someone crash landing on to a strange planet to find himself suddenly faced with ape-rule.However, I still enjoyed the movie very much.  Tim Roth as Thade was a powerhouse, Bonham Carter was good and Michael Clarke Duncan as General Attar was perfectly cast.  He actually made a very funny quote which I read about in a newspaper.  He said ""when my agent called me about a part in this movie, I knew I wasn't gonna be no human!""Anyway back to my comment... this is an entertaining movie, yes it is. Purists, please stop this quest for perfection, it doesn't exist, not anymore anyway.  Entertainment is what matters.  Planet of the Apes with Charlton Heston is brilliant, and emotionally stirring, but it is history. Appreciate it, but move on.  Please.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I did not really have any preconceived notions other than the ""Burton"" touch.  His films are usually dark but beautiful spectacles in my opinion.Sometimes I wonder why people take movie plots so seriously.In the original, a lot of political statements were made (not unusual for Sci Fi films of that area).  It was safe in that genre to make political statements that would be blasted in other genres.The original Planet of the Apes series adequately addressed the issues of the time.  What would be the purpose of reiterating it in 2001?I actually liked the plot.  It was an interesting take or twist of the original.  There was some tongue and cheek dialogue as well.  The ending was the kind the either you liked or thought was really corny.  I liked the ending though, even if it did catch me off guard.I really liked the movie and would buy the video when it becomes available. I am really happy though, I saw it on the big screen.The choice of actors was excellent, I think Tim Roth stole the show, he was so convincing and seemed to enjoy every minute.  I was impressed with the good job that all the actors did.  It did not look easy.I wonder what Tim Burton will do next.  He is truly an artist.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

As many have said, the acting (at least of the apes) was astonishing. The villain chimp (Tim Roth) and Ari the sensitive chimp (Helena Bonham Carter) were amazing, both the acting and the technology to support the believability. Yes, the ending was strange and didn't follow logically whereas for the most part the rest of the movie was logically self-consistent. However, it was a good ending and I'm willing to reserve judgment to see how they develop it in the next film. My few quibbles with the movie were these: * I didn't see any gorillas on the space station and such large apes seem entirely inappropriate to the space mission, so where did the gorilla breeding stock come from? * I realize the apes are stronger than humans, especially the gorillas, but when they hit someone, the impact of the punch was ridiculous even considering their strength. If you could hit as hard as 5 Mike Tyson's on his best punch, you couldn't even come close to getting the target rocketing through the air like they did. And if you hit that hard, it would seem to be instant death but wasn't in the movie. I know, I know, Hollywood needs to really exaggerate. * The year was something like 2032 that it all began, right? Well, there is no way the world will even be close technologically and space achievement in 31 years. Transportation pods smaller than a compact car that can land on an earthlike planet and launch again? The apes genetically engineered to be very smart? The military has a massive space station?                This would be more believable in 2132. Enjoy, Jon","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I loved the original, but understood that this was a re-imagining rather than a remake, so the movie was bound to be at least a bit different.  Burton does an excellent job of visualizing what a city built by primates might look like, vaguely jungle-like, but with buildings.  The plot is at least as good as the first one-I found that whole humans are mute angle just a bit much in the original.  This deals with rights of a stronger group over a weaker, touches on the dangers of allowing military leaders to make political decisions, and in general creates a believable world, especially when it becomes clear just how the apes got there in the first place.  (Just a note of science here-genetically altered chimps can only mean mixing DNA with a compatible species and we share 99% of the same DNA as chimps)  Carter and Roth are outstanding, details such as the gait of the apes are considered and the special effects are kept to a minimum.  I admit I am still undecided about whether or not I like the ending, but let's be honest here-Burton would be less than human if he wasn't planning on a possible sequel.  So why the uproar?  It's not every day you get to see an interspecies love story either.  There are some minor complaints I had, such as why Wahlberg was hell-bent on trying to get all the way back to Earth in what was obviously nothing more than a landing craft, but that hardly detracts from what was an enjoyable and entertaining movie. I recommend it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Being a Bigfoot enthusiast a movie like Planet of the Apes is just a must see for me. This movie is more than just about a human who has to battle an ape for the rights to get along on the planet. Apes are shown and portrayed as being very smart and clever Burton must have done his homework as he well showed in this movie for example apes bury their dead and of course they can't swim, and Bigfoots are the same way!

There is no substantial socio-political commentary here, although there are plenty of gentle nods to racism, classism, sexism, religion, and the rest---along with several well placed winks at the original production [including a splendid cameo by Heston]. This is much more of a ""fish out of water"" and ""search for belonging"" movie that is Burton's specialty.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The entire series is brilliant and I frequently watch them.  I'm not a big Sci-Fi fan, but those movies are just about the best representation of a mix-and-match between social satire and pure ""what if"" filmmaking that makes viewers question themselves.But anyways, the new Apes movie is no different.  The only thing that I really have issues with is the fact that some of the characters didn't really serve much purpose.  I don't know if they had all their lines cut out or what, but they don't really do a whole lot for the film.  Even Mark Wahlberg doesn't have a hell of a lot of dialogue.  But the film starts off much different than the first, and continues along that idea.  Most of the same themes are revisited, but skewed a bit.  The cinematography and makeup are both amazing.  This movie lived up to my expectations.  Go see this movie and judge for yourself.  I heard people coming out of the movie and saying that it sucked.  But, they probably have no basis for comparison if they haven't seen the originals.  I would give this movie 9/10.

For such a good film, all the kudos go not only to Director Tim Burton but also to all the crew, particularly the makeup artists, set designers and the actors.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

So I suppose my learned skepticism somewhat saved Planet of the Apes for me.  I had absolutely no expectations for this film, after having enjoyed the first one so much.  And of course, the new version does not live up to the original.  The original was filled with layers of political, racial, and sociological themes; and it had an incredible ending.  And who can match the tortured, almost humorous essence of Heston.  Oh, and it was fun too. 
But the greatness of the original does not make the new version a bad movie. In fact, it was in my opinion quite an enjoyable movie.  It surpasses the original in terms of its visual effects. While the theme/story is more simplistic, it is very well told; it moves very fast and fluidly, yet is not so packed with chaotic action (see Armageddon) that it does not allow for slower moments that can be saviored.  For example, there is a great scene with Heston in a cameo.  I wonder if he knew what he was saying when he said it: humans are deceptive and dangerous and are even more so because they have guns; beware of them?  Not exactly the NRA's mantra.  Anyways, he had a great cameo.  There are many other humorous moments as well.  Basically, the movie did not take itself seriously.  It tipped its hat to the original without trying to mimick its feel.  It is obvious Burton wanted to have some fun with this movie, paying tribute to the original while at the same time trying to give this movie its own unique perspective.  I believe he succeeded and I believe that that is the movie's saving grace.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Batman, Beetlejuice, Nightmare Before Christmas, all excellent movies.  All of that aside though, this is one damned good movie.  The special effects and make-up look fantastic.  Each ape actually looks different from each other one, and they all move like you would expect an ape/human hybrid to move. The acting is great, especially Tim Roth.  His character Thade is one of my favorite parts of this entire movie.  I have to say I think that the only real weak link is Mark Wahlberg.  I usually like Marky Mark too, but this time his performance seems to fall a little flat.  I know alot of people probably aren't going to like this one.  Some people will mistake certain aspects as being corny, but that can be said about just about every piece of Science Fiction in existence.  The end is good, maybe not as good as the beginning of the original, but good nonetheless.  Overall I enjoyed this film a great deal and recommend it to all.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Visually Stunning, Impressive... and of course, Flawed Version of ""Apes""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512654/?ref_=tt_urv","Allan-14","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0166797/?ref_=tt_urv","19 November 2001","I first became a fan of the ""Planet of the Apes"" saga when I was 12 years old. HBO was showing the original film and I came in on the scene in which Charlton Heston's Taylor was being interrogated in the apes' court. I was hooked from that moment on. I bought all five original films and watched all of them countless times and re-bought them when Fox put out the THX-Widescreen tapeset for the 30th anniversary. What did Apes do for me? Well, to begin with, it made me examine my religion. The end result? I determined I wasn't Christian. It also made me want to be a film director even more. THIS WAS WHAT SCI-FI COULD DO. Even the weakest entry of all, ""Battle for the Planet of the Apes,"" was above standard sci-fi entertainment.So here I am, 22 years old, exploring religion, life, and directing my first ambitious independent film, which is even titled as a small homage to the fourth ""Apes"" film, ""Conquest of Area 52"" (there will be an IMDB entry on it next year sometime). ""Planet of the Apes"" is among my biggest reasons for wanting to make films and it's impacted the way I think as well.I've read the wonderful Pierre Boulle novel (and own the first printing, which I um, borrowed from my high school library) and I will be buying the ""Apes"" TV series on DVD. And of course, I saw Tim Burton's ""reimagining"" of ""Planet"" on opening day.From the beginning, I'm already biased. The original Apes saga was my Bible. To paraphrase, ""Everything I Needed to Know I Learned From Apes."" Heh-heh. Tim Burton... love the guy. He made ""Ed Wood,"" one of my top ten favorite films. His unique visions and styles have always intrigued me. Admittedly however, Burton normally did not have strong points in plot or character development. His ""Batman"" films were a mixed bag, not showing enough of the psychology of what it meant to be Batman, but they were so visually entrancing that I am still able to watch them on their own merits. In fact, both ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"" get an 8.5/10 from me. ""Mars Attacks"" is a joy to watch on the right day, and the same goes with ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Beetlejuice."" By the time he directed ""Sleepy Hollow,"" I felt that Burton had evolved so much as a visual storyteller that he really could not be judged for weak plot or character. That's the way he wants to be as an artist, so let it be.But...This time, he's done ""Planet of the Apes."" If it were anything else, like say a remake of ""2001"", I could still watch it and not crucify it. No, this new version is not anything worth crucifying. ""Apes 2001"", shall we call it, has the all the Burton standards- plot and character on the back burner, awesome visuals at the forefront. What sets Burton aside from say, the biggest hack of all time Michael ""Pearl Harbor"" Bay, is that while his character drama may not be the most engaging, it's not exactly boring or annoying. It's just SIMPLE. This version plays out like the 1968 version except cut down to the core: an astronaut crashlands on a strange planet, he gets caught, is imprisoned at Ape City, gets away with the help of a lovable chimp, goes into the Forbidden Area, finds out the origin of the apes, and leaves the apes to go home. That last part is the only thing really different in the overall structure, except this time, the film does not end there, and we get an ending which both pays its respects to Boulle's original novel and Franklin Schaffner's original film.There are several references this version makes to the original series. With the Apes army we get a nod to ""Beneath."" With the love story, er, triangle, there's a similar feel to Zira and Cornelius' plight in ""Escape."" The look of the astronaut costumes is very similar to those in the first two. And the origin of the apes rings in similar tone to the fourth film, ""Conquest.""Did I like it? I've only seen it twice, so its a bit hard to say that without going, ""except for this... and that... and this... and that..."" What I liked: the cinematography, the sets (which are never all that real-looking but invoke memories of illustrated children's books, which is a Burton constant), the movement and makeup of the apes (maybe the two most noteworthy things done here), the cameos by Chuck Heston and Linda Harrison (Nova from Apes I & II). I also liked the love triangle between Ari, Leo, and the blonde; this was very humorous. Wahlberg didn't add much depth to a written character already lacking depth, but he certainly had the right expressions for his character. I wouldn't be particularly overjoyed by my stay on the Planet of the Apes either. Helena Bonham-Carter is always good in whatever she does, and her character in this was endearing enough to accept her makeup, which differs greatly from the others. Paul Giamatti's Limbo may be the best character of all, providing the most comic relief. Tim Roth as Thade is brilliant, as are the rest of the key players. I didn't appreciate that the social commentaries were sometimes rather clumsily slapped on; indeed a lot of the time they seemed like desperate attempts by Burton to put SOMETHING in there saying ANYTHING when the script had little to give him (Burton arrived on the project fairly late and had little time to shape the film).Overall, this 2001 version of ""Planet"" is far better than it should have been, given the success it had to live up to. It doesn't hold a candle to the original, and I certainly never expected it to. I'm glad Fox put a commercial artist in charge of it, rather than a commercial hack such as the afore-mentioned Michael Bay or Tony Scott. It may have been more intriguing had Oliver Stone worked on it (Stone was attached several years back).Tim Burton did the near-impossible for me: I didn't want to kill him after watching this. And for an Apes fanatic such as myself, that is saying a heck of a lot. Let's all hope that when Fox greenlights the sequel, they don't hand it over to Joel Schumacher. I'd take Ed Wood's Planet of the Apes over his anyday.I do have one quibble I think is more than worthy of consideration to even a non-Apes fan not familiar with the original series:We know where the Apes come from in ""Apes 2001."" But why the heck would that space station have HORSES on it?! Sorry, I'm not gonna take the old lame scientific explanation about how life on other planets must be similar. I may be a Darwin enthusiast, but come on. That's stretching it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Instead it tries to be an incredibly entertaining summer movie, while still being intelligent and retaining Burton's gorgeous visual style. And with that in mind, it fully accomplishes its goals. First of all, the soundtrack, made by long-time Burton collaborator Danny Elfman is up to the composer's high standards. The brutal percussion-based sounds of his score fit the movie perfectly. The story is very satisfying and the ending is excellent. Touches of clever humor add to the script. But, of course, what steals the show is Burton's gift for creating memorable images and his army of apes, led by General Thade, a memorable character played to perfection by Tim Roth. For this movie, Burton often leaves his trademark dark and blue colors, but the movie still has his wonderful touch. As for the apes, they are very impressive. The cast is good, without having very hard jobs to do, but as I said earlier, Roth shines. So, this may not be Tim Burton's best movie, but it is the perfect summer entertainment, offered to you by one of history's greatest directors.85%","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The story, for the most part, was well presented and it made sense as well.

Sure, we'd put some men in space, but no one had landed on any foreign worlds. We imagined, through the voices of such authors as Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov, interstellar travel and advanced civilizations. But all of that seemed to be part of the distant future in 1968.Here were are 33 years later, and while we haven't traveled to other galaxies or met any other civilizations (advanced or otherwise, Whitley Strieber's experiences notwithstanding), we have put a man on the moon and are hard at work on the international space station. In short, in 33 years we've come a long way, baby.Anyone who has seen the original 1968 Planet of the Apes knows that the ending is a real kicker. I certainly won't give it away here, because there's an entire generation that hasn't seen the movie and most certainly should. Suffice to say that the original is unique, not simply another sci-fi flick.The new one is termed a ""rethinking"" of the original. Tim Burton, who gave us Edward Scissorhands, Batman, PeeWee's Big Adventure, and Sleepy Hollow,is the director here, and the film is full of his stylish touch.Mark Wahlberg is Captain Leo Davidson, an astronaut in 2029 on a small space station that is conduction experiments on chimps. An electrical storm strikes, and a chimp is sent out to survey the cause. When the animal does not return, Davidson launches himself - against his commander's orders - to find him. Next thing he knows, his space pod is crash landing on an unknown planet inhabited by talking, aggressive apes - with humans as slaves.Davidson is captured by the apes along with other humans, but escapes. His plan - get back to where his pod crashed, find his GPS-like device that will allow him to locate his mother ship, and get back home. But it's a long way back to the pod, and he suddenly has thousands of apes after him.Luckily, he has on his side Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), a kindhearted ape who feels empathy toward the humans. Ari, of course, symbolizes animal lovers on Earth; she cannot understand why her fellow apes treat their humans so badly. ""We can learn much from them,"" she claims, but her claims fall on deaf ears. Davidson, with the help of Ari, leads a small band of refugee humans (including the Daena, played by the delicious Estelle Warren) to his pod, where he makes some startling discoveries, none of which will be revealed here. (If you've seen the original and know the surprise ending, the discoveries Davidson makes are as intriguing as that ending.)Hot on the trail of the astronaut and his friends is the evil General Thade (Tim Roth) and his fiercest warrior Colonel Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan). The makeup jobs on all of the apes are astounding, and the actors are completely unrecognizable under their disguises. The general has been told by his ailing father (an uncredited Charlton Heston, who starred in the 1968 original) that humans, in the time before time, humans brought violence to their planet; now that apes dominate, humans must be destroyed.
As with the original, this is a fascinating treatise not only on how we treat  other animals but on how we treat ourselves. Is it truly accurate to say that humans are civilized and the apes are the savages? The film actually makes you think about such things, but it's no philosophical hodge-podge of mumbo-jumbo. It's a exciting, powerful movie, worth watching on just about every level.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I guess that when you expect a movie to be kinda dumb and pale in comparison to its original version, then the good qualities of the new version can catch you by surprise and provide a lot of fun when you least expect it.
I had been disappointed by Burton's ""Mars Attacks!"" (It could've been a classic considering that amazing cast), so I let some friends drag me to ""Planet"" with more than a little trepidation.In one of the earliest scenes, the lights of the space station all go dark, and I heard probably half a dozen people around me whispering various versions of ""what, no emergency lighting?!"", so I thought ""Here we go; more Hollywood dumbness unleashed upon the screen..."" but within the next few minutes things started picking up...and from then on I was completely along for the ride.My favorite part of this movie has got to be Danny Elfman's propulsive score; I can't wait to buy this soundtrack. It's great! My second favorite aspect of this film is Tim Roth's wild portrayal of Thade; he delivers quite an inventive homage to great SF villains, all the way back to Ming the Merciless! There are some scenes in which his character is so malevolent that it's spine-tingling.As for the ending (NO SPOILER) - I think it's all intended in fun, with a nod and a wink, not to mention unleashing a spectacular pun upon humanity! (Anyone who's already seen it should get it.)So come on folks, lighten up - this one is pure entertainment. Thanks for the good time, Mr. B!!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Tim Burton once again delivers a movie that oozes with style, class and sophistication, with a world so detailed and believable it's almost mind-blowing.  Not being familiar with the original movie/tv series myself, I didn't quite know what to expect.  I knew from the few articles I had read that Mark Wahlberg plays a pilot who crash lands on a planet ruled by apes, and in an interesting twist, finds himself as the ""alien"".  The story is a great concept and really brings up some interesting issues to think about.  This is one of the things I appreciated about it.  It is one big role-reversal but in two different ways.  Firstly we're no longer the master species in control, we're the animals without the souls to be used and abused. Secondly, instead of being discriminated against because we might be black, white or purple, we're now discriminated against because we're simply human. It says a lot about how we as humans treat others, whether it be animals or people...  I really liked this movie.  The actors were great, especially Tim Roth as Thade.  I've never encountered such a menacing, intimidating character as Roth's Thade on screen before.  Helena Bonham Carter's Ari was curious, naive and likeable and Mark Wahlberg didn't disappoint.  In general, all the ape actors did a fantastic job and combined with the stunningly detailed make-up, pulled it all off in a very convincing fashion.Danny Elfman is the man responsible for the film's score and I remember thinking during the credits, ""Hmm, that name is familiar...""  I will definitely remember his name from now on.  The score is excellent, and at times spine-chilling, particularly during the opening credits.I'm an every-movie person and I really couldn't find much to fault Planet of the Apes on.  My only gripe is that like so many movies these days, it leaves you feeling just a little unsatisfied somehow..  Maybe it's how film-making has changed these days, or the new techniques they use, I really can't put my finger on it.  But with this film it's only a minor thing.  See it.  You wont be disappointed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It has a unique look throughout, with some wonderful and vast sets and locations. The scenery is always slightly different, and that makes it interesting to look at.The conversations between the characters are involving, entertaining and in places even charming. There is some very amusing humour in there as well, nothing hilarious, but enough to get a laugh from the audience.... ""There's nothing you want around your house LESS than a human teenager"" for example, or the Ape with false teeth!The plot is also good. And to a certain extent keep you wondering what will happen next. Mark Whalberg is excellent as the main character. He's just the type you want in a film like this. Lets face it, you wouldn't want Sylvester Stallone or some other muscle bound 'Conan' type bloke down there. But Whalberg makes a very believable main character. General Thade's character is fantastic throughout also.Finally, you know throughout that SOMETHING will happen at the end. It was inevitable. And what IS at the end was very satisfying, hard to get your head around, but really cool none the less.And anyone who thinks that your a shallow individual for thinking that a 're-make' (or re-imaging) is good, is totally wrong. Planet of the Apes is a fine film that entertains throughout and doesn't disappoint anywhere......... and thats ALL anyone can ask for!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In the year 2029, astronaut Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) travels through a storm in space and is separated from his comrades. He lands on a remote planet, where humans are slaves and the apes are rulers. He is captured but attempts to escape and tries to revolt against the apes. You might think that a new version of ""Planet of the Apes"" from 1968 would be a bad idea. But since the story in the new one is rather different than in the original, it becomes a whole new film. Burton´s version comes up with many interesting ideas. He develops the racial issues more than the first one did, and questions the real differences between the humans and the apes.
The acting is first class all the way, Mark Wahlberg is perfect in the leading role, but the real stars here are those who play apes. Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan and Tim Roth are all excellent, especially the latter. Roth is terrific as the evil General Thade, a character whom in the wrong hands could have been a bit silly. But Roth makes him a great villain, and he actually steals the show. I would love to see this British actor in more big budget productions in the future. The acting through the very realistic ape costumes is definitely something worth seeing.Overall, I liked the new ""Planet of the Apes"" better than the first one, and I still liked that one a lot. But the new one has better actors, cooler effects and a clever and entertaining script. It´s not perfect, the movie becomes a bit sentimental and cheesy towards the end, when Wahlberg tries to motivate the humans to fight. And why does it always have to be a kid who wants to be a hero in these big summer movies? I first thought that it was only in the ""Jurassic Park""-trilogy that this was common, but ""Planet of the Apes"" was no exception.  This is still the most exciting adventure I´ve seen this year, and it´s nice to see a summer movie with both brains and muscles. And I liked the ending, even if I didn´t understand much of it at first. But it certainly blew me away, just like Michael Clarke Duncan said it would, in an interview I read.

Also You'll understand this movie a bit better.Visually this movie is wonderful, and the new ape suits are incredible. Unlike the original movie, the apes have a more realistic appearance, they act more, and sounds a bit more like apes. But the apes are still the dominat and intelligent species on the planet. This movie is more based on the original novel by the French author Pierre Boulle. And I'm sure he would be pleased with the story arc in this movie, even though all the french factors have been Americanized.Mark Walberg show us a strong performance, and the movies ""villain"" general Thade, portrayed by Tim Roth, is just terrifying. To be candid the two adversarial roles really saved this movie.It may not be as mind-boggling as the original movies, but it's still well worth watching.

I don't want to ridicule other reviewers, but to suggest that the apes would not enslave humans, or consider them savages because THEY CAN SPEAK ENGLISH and display intelligence is unbelievable baffling.  The very point of the whole D*** movie is to point out how unfair and bigoted people (or apes) can be.  Of course it's illogical, that is the point !!!  Has no one heard of the basically continuous human history of enslavement of our fellows ????  Funnily enough there was ample evidence of intelligence and language there, even English, and yet slavery went on!  All this real life enslavement with one hell of a lot less motivation (greed basically) than is provided the apes in this movie.  Please if you are going to go on and on about plot holes at least stick to safer ground. 
Do the other plot holes really detract from the movie, decided for yourself. I thought the whole look and feel of the movie made up for the its other shortcomings, and that it was a worthy remake of a much loved classic.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Rick Baker's makeup is a marvel, and more than makes up for his King Kong debacle of 25 years ago -- even though they still can't seem to create an ape mask that doesn't make the actors lisp. The action sequences are fast-paced and brutal, and the actors do such a marvelous job ... er ... apeing the moves of primates you're forgiven if you think Burton tossed a silverback or two into the melee just to liven things up.Mark Wahlberg is a disappointment as Leo, coming off as a one-dimensional jerk. The only times he shows any real humanity is when he interacts with a favorite (real) chimp, though he's certainly capable in the action sequences.Helena Botham Carter as the cute, human-loving Ari is the best thing in the movie, presenting a very well-rounded character when she isn't making lovey dovey eyes at Leo (best not to think about it too much). Estella Warren as a sexy slavegirl gets to show off the best lips in Hollywood, engage in an aborted catfight with Ari, wear very little, and go off in a huff of jealousy when Leo seems to want to spend more time with Ari. I get the strong feeling her best moments were left on the cutting room floor. It's always good to see David Warner and Kris Kristofferson, though their time on screen is brief.Tim Roth is fun and scary to watch as the villain, Gen. Thade, while Michael Clarke Duncan makes a menacing figure as Thade's right hand ape.Look fast for Linda Harrison -- the original slave girl in the original movie. Rick Baker himself also appears as an ape. And Burton's longtime love Lisa Marie makes her obligatory appearance, with a funny bit as a snotty, horny ape.The biggest laugh in the file comes from an otherwise dramatic cameo by original film star Charlton Heston. I won't spoil the reasons why it's funny -- only clue: it's not just in the dialogue.Nor will I spoil the ending. I was confused by it at first until I realized... it was CLASSIC Rod Serling. Once I realized Burton was paying homage to the Twilight Zone -- and let's not forget Serling co-wrote the original film -- everything fell into place.My only advice to Burton is to let sleeping apes lie and not attempt to reimagine the other films in the original Apes series. This is a good one-off, but best to move on to the next idea.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Leo escapes with the help of a compassionate ape named Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) and is now a fugitive on the run from the apes. This movie I liked but I don't think was 100% perfect. I thought the make-up was not as good as the originals. The acting was pretty good by my standards. Like all Apes movies, the endings have to twist which this one did.

Mark Wahlberg stars as an soldier who is based on a space station which is experimenting with using chimp controlled spaceships. When one chimp is lost in a spacepod during an exploration of a magnetic space field, Wahlberg takes off (unauthorized) to find it. When the pod enters the field, Wahlberg loses control as well, soon he crash lands in a jungle. And he is VERY quickly introduced to the dominant species on the planet ;) The story which follows is very tightly directed by Burton, and is very well acted by Wahlberg. Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth are (as usual) excellent and don't let the make up (which is designed by the always outstanding Rick Baker) get in the way of the performances. Finally, as usual, a GREAT score by Danny Elfman.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

When watching this film you tend to forget that there are only people under all that fur and makeup and not real Apes,thanks to Rick Baker.As if all that is not enough the casting for this film couldn't have been much better. Tim Roth Plays Thade the General of the Apes that despieses the humans.Tim Roth Delivers an unbelievably frightning performance that he should be recognized for. Helen Bonham Carter gives an absolutely steller performance as Ari. Ari is an ape that has pity for the humans because she see's how poorly they are treated by the Apes, after she meets Leo Davidson (Mark Whalberg)  she starts to realize that Leo is different from the other humans and she starts to believe in the humans more and more. Mark Whalberg Delivers a good performance but nothing that he will be remembered for. And last but not least Danny Elfman, Elfman composed perfect music for this film which I guess was not that big of a surprise because he always gives a 110 percent.

Tim Burton, as always, demonstrates incredible cinematography; the ape makeup is near perfect; and the acting is fine (Tim Roth as Thade is particularly good). People complain about it's ""plot holes"" and ""confusing ending"".  The movie doesn't conflict with itself, does it?  Since when are movie makers required to spell out every detail of the story they are telling? It's not as good as the original, but it's got a lot going for it.

As I was watching it, I thought to myself, ""You know, I'd really like to see this with my 9 year old brother"".  It's a slightly original action movie that supplies enough twists from the usual good guy v. bad guy flick to make it interesting.The movie makes some ham-fisted attempts at social commentary.  At one point in the movie an ape played by Paul Giamatti even exclaims ""Can we all get along?"" That line has been parodied so many times, it's almost painful.  In fact, as memory recalls Tim Burton had Jack Nicholson say the exact same line (to a much greater comic effect in ""Mars Attacks!""  The racism allegories seem so forced, it's distracting.  You almost expect Helena Bonham Carter's ape character to organize a big human-ape chain and start singing ""I'd like to teach the world to sing""But aside from the failed commentary, the movie succeeds.  All of the performances were above par. Tim Roth treaded the line of overacting, but never crosses it and makes a great, and perpetually angry, Thade.  Micheal Clark Duncan surprises as a loyal, and religious gorilla general.  Mark Walhburg makes a convincing action hero, although the tough guy role doesn't allow his trademark less-than-brilliant charm to come through as well.  And Estella Warren, well, she stands there with a look of constant surprise on her face. But, hey, she looks great doing it.The only thing I thought was missing was more of Tim Burton's trademark quirkiness.  If you had shown me this movie, and told me to guess the director, I would have had no clue.  Burton's eye for the odd is what excels good movies to great ones.  But, all in all, a fun couple hours. I'll give it:7.5/10 bananas","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The only apes in this remake that aren't mad all the time are Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) and Limbo (Paul Giammatti), and that's only because Ari is the ""hero ape woman"" and Limbo the comic relief.  Of course, the humans in ""Planet of the Apes"" aren't really any better.  They're either really nervous all of the time, or really angry.  Maybe if both races calmed down a little, they'd have some peace!Aside from the prozak prescription, this was a reasonable remake.  Not Burton's best, not by far, but his directing it makes it a lot better. The fight scenes are entertaining, and Tim Roth delivers as the evil General Thade.  Unfortunately, Roth is the only actor who delivers a great performance.  Sure, the others weren't bad, but they didn't match Roth's ability to basically ""become the ape"".  Even Oscar nominee Michael Clarke Duncan moves a little roboticly sometimes.Still, a good, dark sci-fi thriller, 7.5/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

While I will admit that far too many films are moronic today, so to are far too many of the audience. The original Planet of the Apes is undoubtedly a good film with some stunning moments ( it's wonderful how a film gets elevated to the level of masterpiece when people need a reason to moan about its sequel / remake ), but the potential was in the premise for a different type of film. For all the original's strengths I think you'd be hard-pushed to claim it was exciting, or visually interesting. Tim Burton has seized the opportunity to explore these possibilites, resulting in a highly entertaining if undemanding film. As a complete redraft of the original it is ultimately a very different entity, but it in no way embarrasses  the original nor takes anything away from it. Honestly, what do the 'how dare they do this to a classic film' brigade imagine is going to happen? Do they think the original is going to cease to exist? That from now on people will only ever discuss the remake? Unlikely. There is little in this film that will cause much discussion, but then I've never heard anyone discuss the original either. And yes, the ending is obvious and not as good as the first one ( as the most known 'twist' ending of all time they could scarcely have repeated it ), but there is nothing in the original that scarcely comes close to the amusing satire on human behaviour to be found in the first half of Burton's remake. Most important of all (and this goes out particularly to those who decry the tarnishing of the original 'classic'): This movie is FUN. You can't say that for the '68 version...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Obviously it is a good-looking film, with terrific costumes, photography and make-up.  It is also usually compelling storytelling - not Pierre Boulle's PLANET but not the original film either.  Points for originality for sure. I like that the humans could speak - their lack of speech in the first film was never effectively explained.  Even though the film is fleet, there is a noticable lull after Neil and company have successfully fled ape city. Burton wisely gets right on to the film's conclusion and (surprise) ending post haste.  But while the story flies by, the character development is non-existant and the love story is divided between the female of TWO species.  To be fair, our leading man is not the most compelling actor - but Heston was no Olivier either.  The story has multiple holes - where did the horses come from anyway? There's no sign of any non-ape or human life except these equines but no clue is given as to why there are no other creatures about.  The cameos by Heston and Harrison are badly handled though the refs to first film are fun for fans.  The surprise ending manages to combine the shock of the original with the option for a sequel.Burton's film lacks the scope and epic feel of it's inspiration and it will doubtless join the LOST IN SPACE film on the rental shelves.  Now if someone were to make Boulle's vision - that would be something.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Anyway, the atrocious acting in Planet of the Apes was embarrassing to watch. I liked Mark in the Perfect Storm but in this movie he was horrible, also miscast, I believe, remembering how Charlton Heston was so much a better choice in the first movie. I agree with so many other negative comments about this movie and so I won't repeat them. All the promotion that went into this movie made me believe it was a worthwhile movie but what a waste of time and money.

The only ""ape"" character who is able to look convincingly like a gorilla rather than a man in make-up is Michael Clarke Duncan. Now, of course, one could make the same complaint about the original, but one of the stated reasons for remaking an SF film is that the special effects have progressed to the point where the story can be better told. Not the case here.....Because the film relies so heavily on production design and quick editing, the viewer is never able to invest in the story or the characters. Mr. Whalberg, you are no George Taylor, though in some calculated way, I'm sure you appeal to a certain demographic.This is a film contrived by marketeers and sociologists. Apparently, Mr. Burton shot 6 endings in an attempt to find the one that would guarantee the most box office. The one that made it onto the print is non-sensical (unless it is explained in a sequel). If you want time travel, Star Trek has done it ad nauseum over the past few years. Mr. Burton isn't doing anything new here.The original film had facets and layers. No characters were truly evil, none truly good. George Taylor was a cynic and a loner. There were aspects of adventure in the story, aspects of suspense, social commentary, comedy, all done in a subtle enough manner, with enough change in theatrical pacing to make it a classic that still stands up to repeated viewing today.The new film is ""good guys vs. bad guys"", there's the requisite central antagonist, Mr. Whalberg's sole motivation appears to be saving his pet chimp, and his only expression is a blank stare.Lines from the original film (there are two of them that I could tell) have been thrown in, and delivered with little context, and therefore not fitting into film. They serve as a reminder of the superiority of the first series.The marketeers have called this a 'reimagining' of the first film. Mr. Burton likes to 'reimagine' other people's work: Batman, Sleepy Hollow, Mars Attacks. His one good film was an affectionate (therefore, non-moneymaking)tribute to the ""B"" movie film-maker Ed Wood.Mr. Wood would be proud of this remake. Both Burton and Wood share an 'understanding' of SF, and this is a film that stands proudly and comparably with ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"". Congratulations Tim and Fox. Well done!!!!!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I went to see this movie hoping to keep out of my mind all recollection of the original 1968 movie.  Then this remake goes and quotes the original version again and again, in the clunkiest, most ham-fisted way! ""Get your stinking paws off me, you damned dirty human!""  ""Damn them all to hell!""  Feh!Actually, this movie wasn't all that bad.  It didn't stink to high heaven, which is as much as I seem to hope for in a movie these days.  The story (of which I will reveal nothing - I don't want to spoil it for anyone) is very good, with lots of nifty twists.  The Pride of Dorchester MA, Mark Wahlberg (remembered in Boston as Mahky Mahk), is quite good as the protagonist human.  On the down side, Paul Giamatti's human slave trader of an orangutan provided an irritating dose of little needed comic relief, and Helena Bonham Carter is surprisingly shallow, not showing any presence from under all that ape makeup.  (The same cannot be said of Tim Roth, who exudes much menace as the scary monkey of every little kid's nightmares.)Overall, I'd have to say a very good story was given a formulaic action-movie treatment with some very irritating moments, but not enough to ruin the movie entirely.  It helped, of course, that I saw this at a matinee, so I only had to cough up $5.

However, I was not. I saw this with two friends. After the movie one said, ""Can anyone make a good movie anymore?"" The other said, ""I feel like I'm now dumber after watching this.""To make a movie about talking monkeys work for me, it needs to be very, very dark. This one wasn't, so the frightening and suspenseful scenes become rather humorous. The plot is very simplistic, but that doesn't keep it from having many holes. The dialogue is either non-existent, pointless, or trying to sound cool and technical when it's not. Poor Estella Warren had about five lines in the whole movie. There are some points in the movie where they try to play some sub-plot drama points, but they do not play them up enough for us to understand their conclusions. The entire film lacks drama altogether. And the ending, namely, from when the fighting showdown starts until the credits, ruined what little the rest of the movie had to offer.Bright points would be the costumes. Not even the action sequences were bright. But costumes were very good. And the human-trading monkey provided some much-needed laughter.My advise is to please not waste your money and time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) crash lands on a distant planet run by ape people. They're scary, aggresive, and they hate humans. They inprision humans and make them slaves. But, Leo is the macho, egotistical type (a must for these kinds of movies). He breaks out along with the beauty Daena (Estalla Warren) with the help of ape Ari (Helena Bonham Carter). General Thade (Tim Roth, one scary looking dude) quickly finds out about this and doesn't take to it lightly. He gathers his whole army so they go searching for the humans. Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan) is humble assitant who is second in command.
For about 45 minutes of the movie it wasn't looking so good, because of the character of Leo and his cliché. The characters were kind of a problem. They were old and tired. Ari posses the most heart, though. Also, a love triangle emerges between Ari, Leo, and Daena.. Th film seems scared, though, to take on the subject of ""inner-species"" dating. It doesn't, until about the last 30 minutes, give us anything we've already seen before. Except great make-up. But the thing about it is, it's a lot of fun. I picked up the problems I listed above, but really didn't care. Tim Burton, personally, is my favorite director. He has yet to make a bad film. He has a certain style that is dark and ominous, Here, it is muddled and doesn't show up until about the last 30 minutes. You can sense it's there but it doesn't show up  until then.
""Planet"" has one of the greatest endings of the year, which is the high point of the movie. It's also got some other neat twists in it along the way. So, despite it's many problem, ""Planet"" is an enjoyable, often funny, often scary, summer movie.Note: Pay attention to Danny Elfman's tremendous score. He had done most of Burton's films and each score is terrific. I don't feel he gets enough recognition, so I thought I'd mention it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Fortunately for me, I found out beforehand that it was NOT a remake, but a re-interpretation of the original. Knowing this, you shouldn't expect many similarities between the original movie (other than a few lines), and this version. About the only thing really similar to the original is ""Apes ruling humans."" The similarities essentially stop there. I thought the makeup was superb, and Tim Roth's Gen.

I could go on about the endless flaws in this movie but I just don't have the time.  I will touch base on a few to keep those interested in viewing it far from it.  In one instance, Captain Leo lands in a mud filled swamp on the Ape planet.  Sure enough when they show an underwater scene the water seems clearer than the Great Barrier Reef.  I paused the DVD to see if I could see Coral.  Another HUGE flaw is the fact that the Apes hate humans much like humans dislike wasps in cars. Funny thing is that the Apes live so much like us humans all the way down to their Versace clothes.   Like I said, I could go on and on but I will not.

It was predictable, and cliche ridden. In the original, Heston's character could speak when no one else could....the suspense built waiting for him to speakout & show that he was more advanced than the other humans. In the remake, ALL the humans can speak, and there's nothing that differeniates Wahlberg's character from the others. The story was terrible, to say the least. People say ""oh, but the special effects were great"". Well that may be true, but don't you need a story to go along with it? Is this what the movie going public has become? And, is it too much to ask for some acting to be thrown in there, too? Lastly, where did that blonde get the lipstick she wore throughout the movie?

That perception is that you'll see something very different than the usual lint that's produced after good movies are tumbled about in the Hollywood dryer; with all their wrinkles removed, sickly pseudo fresh (like a Downey fabric sheet that touts it smells of `Fresh Rain' yeah right), and softened as not to cause chaffing. But Burton is different. Burton has vision. Burton is a visionary. I have uttered those words before in reference to his litany of twisted, incredibly clever and dark films. Burton's early shorts, Vincent and Frankenweenie, are things born of a mind and an eye that's capable of seeing the world through gray colored lenses. Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Edward Scissor Hands, The Nightmare Before Christmas, Ed Wood, Batman, Mars Attacksevery one of these movies had that visionthat dig up the dirt up and put it under the light feel.Which is why then, with Planet of the Apes, I can claim as the only explanation for such appalling drivel is that Burton completely and utterly sold out for the lure of a `Big Budget Hollywood Summer Blockbuster'. Who better than Burton to `revisit' P of A (as Burton nearly screams in every interview that this is NOT a remake), one of the darkest and engaging sci-fi films made? But, here's the question: if this is not intended to be a remake, then why not cast that famous Burton vision on this piece and make it something more strange, moredare I sayhuman? Take Burton's other filmsthe hero is most often an odd, socially maladjusted, misunderstood, feared, decidedly melancholy, alone, scared and scarred, but somehow better than the lot of others around him. His characters, in their own eerie way, show the more benevolent side of human nature.So, then Mark Wahlberg's self-serving Leo in P of A is someone NOT from Burton's world. So, then the `plot' (and I use the word `plot' with hesitation) of P of A is also something not Burtonesque. Thus the whole experience is such a total let down that it makes one wonder if big budgets and high profile stars stifles anything creative as easily as a 40ft wet blanket thrown on a single lit match (enter into evidence America's Sweetheart). Burton usually strives on lancing the boil of our perceptions and getting to the raw under layer of culturesand P of A (the original was a hearty, if campy, examination and damnation of the snobbery of humans to dub ourselves as rulers of any planet) would seem to give Burton the chance to perform a wonderful social surgery.The gray colored glasses though were replace by the $green$ colored lenses, and so we are left with just another shell of a movie. The only vision Burton can see, for what are supposed to be genetically enhanced apes, is that they will emulate human social customsthey will form armies, they will have a senate, conduct dinner parties and sport Jackie O bobs; this is visionary? Hardly. In the end all we learn from Burton's P of A is the same thing we see in too many movies and the same thing we see in nearly every nook and cranny of the world; whoever can beat one's chest the loudest, whoever can physically beat the other side down, whoever has better weaponry will ultimately prevail. Burton had the chance to show a better wayinstead he merely aped his lesser peers and created another loud, ridiculously expensive and mindless testament to violence.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I find it hard to believe that this film, dreadful though it was overall, wasn't nominated for an Oscar in any of these categories, especially given some of the lacklustre work that WAS nominated, like ""Amélie""? and ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".  And it's not as if any of the other art direction nominees are particularly dazzling, either.  But ""Planet of the Apes"" IS dazzling.  The world has its own intriguing version of everything, from tents to buckles to embossed armour designs, and the ape suits are so invisibly convincing we forget that there are human actors underneath even when we have a live chimpanzee as a point of comparison.Tim Burton began life as an animator and the best film he's had anything to do with (""The Nightmare Before Christmas"") owes almost everything to his fantastic designs.  But, as is becoming increasingly clear, he rose to hislevel of incompetence when he became a director.  ""Planet of the Apes"" is superb visually, but in no other way.  And even to say that it's superb visually is misleading.  The climactic battle scene is wrong in almost every way it's possible for a climactic battle scene to be wrong: it's all confusing close-ups of characters whumping one another, with no overall design, or end, in sight - until the deus ex machina that we'd all seen coming an hour ago descends to bring the tedious violence to a merciful end.Burton clearly WANTS to be able to spin a gripping yarn.  Why else does he tell this particular story?  But he can't draw us close to any of the characters, he can't tell the difference between mushy cliché and invigorating simplicity (the ""inspiring"" dialogue manages to be banal without making any sense), and he can't take three paces without tripping over his own irony.  Irony?  More like flippancy.  Comments like ""You can't solve the human problem by throwing money at it - we tried that, and all we got was a welfare state that nearly crippled us"" are the work of screenwriters who live in terror of being caught out being sincere about something, who want to cover their tracks by suggesting that, not only don't they mean what they're saying, they don't mean anything.Anyone who doubts that Burton's film is flippant through and through will have their doubts dispelled by ending.  The original film is famous for the twist at the end - so famous, in fact, that that particular twist cannot be used again.  A pity, for it was a good one.  It made sense - more importantly, it made sense OF the earlier parts of the film - and it had a good deal of poetic force.  Burton decided to ditch poetic force and all that jazz in order to preserve the least essential aspect of the twist in the original - its shock value.  His ending is shocking, all right.  It makes no sense.  It's easy to shock if you're prepared to break off the narrative in mid-sentence and start talking nonsense.Mark Wahlberg is as unappealing as he ever has been, and it can't all be the script's fault.  He goes through the whole film without once dropping the belligerent expression of an ex-rapper who wants to maintain his ""cred"". And Estella Warren looks like one of those almost supernaturally unappealing models who grace the pages of the latest generation of men's magazines (Maxim, FHM, etc.), with computer-generated skin and computer-animated anatomy, dressed up as a cavegirl - not for the film, but for a photoshoot.P.S.:  What the hell did Burton mean when he said that this wasn't a remake, but a ""re-imagining""?  What's the distinction?  I thought remakes WERE re-imaginings.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Schaffner's 1968 version of Pierre Boulle's novel was the first film I saw when I started my moviegoing career at 13, so rather inevitably it would take a lot for this new one to surpass my wonderful experience from then.Except for Tim Burton's film to be pacier and noisier, one of the important differences is the fact that the apes here are apier (e. g. swinging in the trees and so on), and the ape masks and costumes have become more flexible which altogether should add up to some improvement.On the other hand the incessant onslaught of computer-generated special effects unfortunately dwarfs the actors much of the time (especially Mark Wahlberg), and further the philosophical aspects and debating are toned down compared to the old version.All in all this was somewhat of a disappointment. Certainly not because Tim Burton has made an un-professional or amateurish movie, but because I cherish Schaffner's film more for sentimental reasons and not least for having a more adventurous feel and a narrative flow (and drive) that is missing here.A circumstance I hardly understand myself as Tim Burton's film is choke-full of great images, noise, action and commotion in general.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film cleverly avoids imitating the original but at the same time makes amusing references to the original.

I guess the current leader of the National Rifle Association has a sense of self-mocking humor after all.Tim Roth is excellent as a bad-guy who is one of the most  threatening villains since Dracula. The film is worth seeing just for his performance.The story is an interesting allegory about the injustice of human-animal relations as well as human-human inhumanity. Tim Burton seems to be having a field-day playing around with perspective, human-ape evolution arguments, and even space and time.It doesn't have the surprises of the original film, but that's only because it isn't the original.

My biggest complaint would probably be the inclusions of homages to the original films, as they were distracting from the new one. There seem to be a lot of people upset that the movie wasn't as ""serious"" as the originals, but how serious can you take a film with talking gorillas?? It's a fun science fiction film, and the cheesy one-liners, far fetched science, and comic relief were very enjoyable. Sort of like Burton's Batman or Beetlejuice.

From the same man, we've had a Batman who acts more like a real millionaire whose parents were murdered in front of him as a boy would, and a Sleepy Hollow that reads more like a Shakespeare play, highlighting as Washington Irving's original story does how badly this overrated poet's dialogues fail to reflect real human speech. In this new version of Planet Of The Apes, we get to see an air force pilot who behaves like an air force pilot, an ape civilisation that behaves like an ape civilisation, and a metaphor for the civil rights struggle that reads more like the X-Men feature film than the restrained, ""don't want to upset the powers that be"" style of the television series.I've read on this site that the film is simply rehashed in order to suit those with short attention spans. Not true. All through the film, one thinks of how a simple collection of apes from a research station could have evolved into almost-bipedial, talking ones with more distinctive personalities. The next few sentences may spoil any surprises, so those of you who have not seen the film yet can scroll past them at your leisure. One aspect of the film I found a bit disappointing is the fact that the original talking ape who is referred to as CMOS by his descendants is never fully explained. His origins and the reason he is called that are never really talked about, and I originally thought he would be the monkey that Wahlberg's character shot off into space in order to rescue. I must admit, however, that ending the battle between the humans and the apes by having said monkey land right in the middle of them was a fine touch. The metaphor for religion by showing that CMOS, this figure the apes worship for being the original free ape, got to start his own civilisation by murdering the humans who were originally caring for him, was an ingenious stroke. My only real complaint relates to the ending. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet, unlike some internet sites, but were I in this pilot's position, I honestly would have stayed. It's not every day that one gets a chance to help build a new civilisation with two very different races are just learning to work with each other. Compared to the planet Earth as it is today, and it shows no signs of ever getting better, it is a real paradise.Given all the displays in the film of appalling behaviour towards humans and each other by the apes, and how they resolve themselves, I think Tim Burton's reinterpretation manages to drive home a point that I seriously doubt the original films and television series would have been allowed to. The fact that not all racism is white-on-black seems a taboo subject in 2001, but one that this film handles metaphorically in an intelligent way. Give it a try without the prejudice of original Apes series fans to blinker you, and it may just surprise you. Encourage yourself to think of a better ending, though. Encourage yourself to think of all the different ways the apes could have evolved, in fact. This is not Planet Of The Apes Lite... it is Planet Of The Apes non-Disney style, something we need applied to more old ""family-oriented"" piles of cobblers.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Now i see that people didn't get the idea behind the new film. The film IS a 're-imagining' or whatever you want to call it, and it is not a 're-make.'  If you go to the cinema expecting to see the original 'Planet of the Apes' only with different actors and better effects you will come away feeling disappointed, if you go expecting to see a Tim Burton film on a par with the likes of 'Sleepy Hollow' and 'Batman' and with different messages behind it you'll get what the film was trying to do.  This is a problem of any film trying to do something thats been done before, the film its self is lost in the comparisons, take 'The Phantom Menace' for example, if you hadn't of seen 'Star Wars' you'd probably thing it was a great film on its own.Long story short:  They've taken the original 'Planet of the Apes' and set it to a new target audience.  Take that into account when you see it and you'll see a truly great modern film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Usually, I pick one or two movies each year which go on my ""buy the video"" list.  Last year, it was ""The Matrix.""  This year so far, it's ""Shrek.""  What do these two have in common?  They were well written.  Good writing, when accompanied by good visuals and a good score, can make a movie great.  ""The Matrix"" and ""Shrek"" prove that people actually appreciate good writing.  Most of the reviews concerning ""Planet of the Apes"" complain about plot holes (bad writing), the ending (I liked the reviewer who revealed the clue Ape Lincoln---in fact, the ending may have been ""forced"" on the writer because of this pun, and now they have to make sense out of that pun by writing a sequel that explains it), uncreative face-offs / battle scenes, and character development.  I think this country is full of good writers, but they apparently only infrequently make it through the Hollywood meat grinder.I have to agree that ""Planet of the Apes"" suffers tremendously in the writing department.  I liked only three characters, Ari (a fine line between human compassion and simian behavior), General Thade (convincingly evil), and the human slave trader (a few good laughs).  These characters were minimally written, but at least they had character.  No other ape or human in the film was developed.  Estella Warren was totally devoid of any character, and did not exist in this plot for any reason.  She wasn't even good eye candy.At the very least, the movie should have ended after the chimpanzee in the pod removed his helmet before the ape masses, giving Burton more time to develop the characters from the beginning of the film up to this point.There are many points to make about how to write a good script.  One point is that a battle between two good characters is almost always more interesting than a battle between a good and evil one.  As a point of reference, think about the ending of ""The Vikings,"" where Kirk Douglas and Tony Curtis battle to the death on a seaside castle.  You really care about both characters.  You don't want either one to die.  It's so much easier to play the ""I want comeuppance"" card than the ""tragedy"" card in a battle scene. In ""The Vikings,"" it's not even brute force that determines the victor.I love science fiction, and my favorite is still ""Aliens,"" which defies most sci-fi cliches in the sense that it's an action picture with good writing and a child who actually enhances rather than detracts from the film. However, ""The Matrix"" is on my top five list.  Hopefully, the Matrix sequels will be well written.In short, Hollywood needs to go back to basics and only film well written stories.  I'm sure there are thousands of average people out there who could do a better job (the reviews here prove there are a lot of good heads) writing a movie like this.  But the average person will never get a chance.So, if you go see ""Planet of the Apes,"" do so for the visuals and a decent score.  Maybe that's enough for casual entertainment.  But it won't stir any activity in your brain (unless you write movie reviews afterward!).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I went to the theater with high expectations (because, let's face it, it's Tim Burton), and this movie struck a cord with me, because it is my favorite Sci-Fi film in the last decade and a half, the movie was 'Aliens'.Mark Wahlberg did a very good job as the lost Capt. Leo Davidson, but my hat goes off to General Thade himself, Tim Roth. He was *excellent* as the sadistic, human loathing primate villain. Michael Clark Duncan also was perfect support as Thade's brutish right hand man, Colonel Attar.Every one who was an ape did an excellent job at moving like actual primates. The score kept you with the flow of the movie, the choreography was marvelous, and the acting was good. The action sequences were very intense, and the chase between the humans and Thade's Army was very suspenseful. There was an outstanding surprise to the end of this movie, it was very unexpected. I recommend this movie to any one who wants an exciting, special effects adventure, but this movie also has a very surprise end, good acting, and a great plot.        Do not compare this to the original, because the only thing connects them is a title. Also, Charlton Heston made a pleasing cameo as Thade's father, and blurts out the most famous quote in sci-fi movie history! If you have a choice between this, and Jurassic Park 3, pick this, because this has excitement AND brains. 9/10","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Yet, the emotion that struck me the most was that of ingenuity. Director Tim Burton proves himself as an ingenious filmmaker and he proves it twofold in this exciting, inventive and thrilling film. The sets are spectacular, costumes are terrific and Danny Elfman's musical score captures the essence of the film as he does with all his musical compositions for Burton's films. The producers of the film have stressed that this is not a remake, but more so a revisiting' of the original. Anyone who compares this film to the original is gravely mistaken due to the mere fact that the 2001 version has been dichotomized by one of the soon to be' legendary alternative filmmakers - Tim Burton. This film widely separates itself from the original as seen from its' first frame and takes off on a whole new different direction. The film opens with a great credit intro. sequence displaying Danny Elfman's fierce musical score which sets the film's tone not as an unrealistic fantasy, but as a rousing sci-fi/adventure. The opening scene depicts Wahlberg's ill-fated space station attempt at conducting test runs with the ape species. After a mishap forces him off the ship, Wahlberg's character Leo Davidson finds himself crash landing on a distant planet ruled by apes.  This is where the fun begins Director Tim Burton puts a classic spin in this film invoking the notion of role reversal. In this planet, humans are the pets, the slaves, in essence humans on that planet are all the things we as humans on this planet earth shape and torture our inferiors to be. A great scene is one of the very first that immediately displays the intelligence of these iron fist creatures conversing around the dinner table about the threat of the human species. Enter this year's ultimate movie villain  General Thade. The incredibly underestimated and unrecognizable Tim Roth plays this overachieving ape villain who is hell-bent on the total annihilation of all humans with fierce audacity and destruction. Upon the dissection of this film as a cinematic lesson, one will discover many plot holes' - (Did Leo Davidson and Ari, his rebellious ape escort have a love affair?) Many more plot holes -  (Did Leo Davidson and Estella Warren's human rebel Daena also have an affair?). Mysterious deaths not explained - (Why exactly did one character so unexpectedly sacrifice himself for the sake of others and the rest of pack continue on as if nothing happened?) These mind-benders as well as others will occupy the intelligent filmgoer's mind for quite some time after the film.Yet, these questions can all be put to rest because Burton does not set out to win awards with this film (Except for Best Make-Up come Oscar time for Rick Baker). This film is merely a means of the best of the popcorn blockbusters' this summer. As well, we see Burton's maturity as a Director in relation to the grandeur of a film. Let's face it  the revisiting of the classic apes' films is a huge undertaking. And for Tim Burton to create and present a richly satisfying, fun film is quite the achievement. Anyone who expects a brash film course should not watch this film. This film wants the audience to have fun and to dwell into a world never seen before in this uniqueness. Therefore in this sense, the film scores some big points in terms of imagination and vision.  The film makes it a point of paying homage' to the originals yet distancing it enough so it is not afraid to make fun of itself. Furthermore, despite its surreal qualities, fantastic set pieces and incredibly true to life ape creatures brought to life by a wonderful cast, the film's major drawback is that it seems too dark and animalistic for its' own good. We are all aware that Burton's visionary uniqueness is brought forward with dark sets and spooky visions. Yet, it seems as if Burton intentionally wants us to know this is his creation even when we are entangled within the film, resulting in the darkness and primal aesthetic being overused. But in an odd way this is what adds to the genius and excellence of it all. Resulting in this film easily regarded as one of Burton's best films.Giancarlo's Rating: ***","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

People scream that the makeup effects weren't well done. Well, what do you expect from an attempt to synthesise human faces with ape bodies? I felt they were done just the right way... such that they looked like apes but the actors were still recognisable.Tim Burton's deft touch in the set design and photography lends his usual dark edge to the film, making it far more grown-up in appearance than the pastel-like sequels to the original Planet Of The Apes, especially the television series. Everything looks a lot more believeable, and the sets appear much more functional. The Omeron looks much more like a deep-space research station, and the flight pods look more like they were designed for their purpose.Mark Wahlberg is good as a caring human being, and I really believed in his compassion for the monkey, but he doesn't quite possess that leader quality. I think it would have been better if he'd been supported by one or two more humans from the space station. The ending, such as it is, had me a little perplexed too. Here is a man standing on the verge of a brave new world where men and other members of the animal kingdom can be educated to work together in harmony, he has a beautiful woman who wants him, and he decides to go home. Sorry, I just couldn't buy that, but then, it's pretty plain to me that the Earth of 2001 just sucks.Still, with all the barbs about inter-species arrogance, reverse racism, and the origins of cults, Planet Of The Apes is one film that should be given a fairer hearing. Maybe the critics of today just need to put down their Bibles, their filmmaking guides, and their prejudices towards old, outmoded special effects, and just lighten the hell up.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Mark Wahlberg was horrible (another big surprise...not!) the average door-to-door vaccum salesman would have been a better choice. Helena Bonham Carter (disguised by thick layers of polyurethane and ""you can see all their mistakes on every close-up shot"" make-up) was the only one who played their part well. She seemed oddly out of place, but made the movie a little more watchable. The ending was so absurdly stupid it gives me an aneurysm every time I try to think about it. The genius of it is: It's stupid on every conceivable level. It doesn't matter if you're Steven Speilberg or Steven Jones (the 80 year old crazy looking janitor at Homeland), you're simply un-able to like the ending at all. What's really sad is that this could have been a ""good"" movie. Wahlberg sub-par acting skills could have been overlooked if they just didn't add all the stupid scenes. If you choose to inflict this movie upon yourself then you'll know what I'm talking about. Certain things just didn't need to be there. Estella Warren, for instance. Her character did nothing of relevance at all. There was no romance between her and Wahlberg, she only had a few lines, but you could tell that they were trying to give the impression of romance, but it didn't work at all. And, despite the fact that she has lived her entire life in a desert wilderness being captured by Apes and forced to do slave-labor, and then escape, her lip-stick never fades! It's amazing! It seemed like a really ""americanized"" film though, all the way.

It was very unfortunate that I did not. This isn't to say that there aren't good qualities, because this film does have wonderful moments. The parts, though, are greater than the whole.
The main problem, as I see it, was trying to recreate the original Planet of the Apes in the first place. The original was released at the peak of the civil rights movement, and it's message of tolerance and understanding had much more meaning back then. Now, without any social relevance to justify it, the film comes off as nothing more than a loud, disposable summer flick. Of course, if anyone could even come close to making a good POTA remake, it'd be Tim Burton. His vision of the apes' world is incredible, and he comes very close to making the film work. The makeup effects by Rick Baker are also an impressive achievement, but, once again, it played better in the original because it was new. Another thing that made the first one so brilliant was the clear social distinction between ape and man. The film made the humans appear inferior through one very obvious, but effective, manner: it took away the humans' speech abilities. This made them more animal like, and it made Charlton Heston's character more relevant. But in this new version, the humans can speak, which makes their inferiority to the apes unclear. Physically,  the apes are much stronger than the humans, but the humans out number the apes 4 to 1. And the new hero, played by Mark Wahlberg, has no clear attribute to make him stand out to the benevolent ""human rights activist"" Ari. She notices him for a somewhat creepy sexual attraction. The most disappointing thing about this new version, though, was the ending. I won't give it away,because it was a surprise, but I was very let down. It unsuccessfully tried to recreate the startling final shot of the original, but without the aspect of suspense the whole epilogue seemed forced and sloppy, not to mention ludicrous. On the bright side, there is the aforementioned Burton and Baker, some welcome (but slightly misguided) comic relief, and a sexy human heroine in Estella Warren, who has an incredible body but a very sketchily defined character. Overall, I can't honestly recommend it to fans of the classic original, but non-discriminatory summer audiences may enjoy it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

For the most part, the film holds up since Burton gives it a lot more intensity than the original.  However, notwithstanding everything, including Mark Wahlberg's lightweight performance, the much debated ending is a cop-out; a cheap shot of Hollywood's creative bankruptcy.  It just doesn't make sense, and isn't worth debating about because it is shot thru w/ holes.

No, worse than stupid, so far beyond stupid I can't even use real words to describe how stupid it was.  It was Uberstupid.The story is no secret.  Even if you've never seen the ultra-cheesed-out original you know that an astronaut lands on a planet inhabited by a bunch of smart monkeys, and doesn't like being pushed around.  As a kid I remember reading the ""Apes"" comic books with the little 45's in the back, and those left an indelible mark on my brain: images of aggressive monkeys dressed in hip 60s-style war togas; atomic bomb-worshipping men; general world destruction.  And of course I remember the evil Dr. Zaius.The new ""re-imagined"" ""Planet of the Apes"" left mental scars as well -- not scary or thought-provoking scars -- just plain old scars, like when you fall off a jungle gym or something.  We begin our uberstupid-ness on a space station somewhere near Saturn, where some scientists/astronauts/people-in-white-clothing are training monkeys for solo space flights.  Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) likes the primates enough but he wants a shot at flying for himself.  When an electromagnetic (aka ""time-travel"") storm comes too close to the station, Leo decides to rescue a monkey that's already been lost in the static.  He (of course) encounters some bright lights and big booms, and ends up crashing on a nearby planet.As soon as he arrives, Leo realizes that things are a little off. He, along with hundreds of other humans, are kept in cages by walking and talking apes who want to trade them or kill them or brand them, or all three.  But Ari (Helena Bonham Carter), the daughter of the Apes' political leader (and who bears an eery resemblance to post-surgical Michael Jackson), doesn't think humans should be abused and caged. Leo convinces her to purchase him from slave-trader Limbo (the hilarious Paul Giamatti) as a house-servant.  Ari also buys Daena (Estelle Warren), the fiesty daughter of Kris Kristofferson who has a thing for Leo and dresses like Raquel Welch in ""One Million Years B.C.""
Leo and Daena end up working as caterers at Ari's father's dinner party.  Guests include a snooty orangutan, a vicious gorilla named Colonel Attar (Michael Clark Duncan), and General Thade (Tim Roth), a Danny Devito-like chimpanzee who compensates for his short stature by growling at everything and jumping around a lot.  When Thade's not wheezing like an asthmatic Jack Palance, he's trying to win over Ari, who's not really impressed with his Alpha-Male routine.  She'd rather mate with the heroic yet sensitive spaceman, who returns Ari's longing glances and finds beauty in her ability to write with her feet. But Leo also yearns for Daena for some reason.  An odd interspecies love triangle ensues.Anyway, impatient Leo is anxious to get back to his ship, so he easily escapes from the ape city, taking Daena, Ari, Ari's gorilla bodyguard, and a few other stragglers with him.  They travel over jungle and desert on their way to Calima, an ancient ruin that holds the secrets to the Apes' origins (gee, what could they be?).  When we discover why the place is called ""Calima"" I have to wonder how stupid these apes really are.Thade and his army march to Calima to have it out with that pesky astronaut once and for all, and then some other stuff happens that will either confuse you or disappoint you.  Or both.  Characters seen only briefly until now suddenly take presidence, only to disappear again.The ending is just as random.The monkey actors are generally decent, but are held back from being great by mumbling incoherently beneath rubber masks and waddling around like, well, like monkeys.  The humans ain't that great either. Everyone is this movie just needed to shut up.  Every time someone opened their mouth I rolled my eyes and prayed it wasn't yet another line taken from the original movie thrown into a new and supposedly funny context.I don't know why this ended up being so bad.  Tim Burton is a fabulous director who's brought marvelous vision to the screen before he wasted his time with this disjointed and sloppily-directed project. The ""Planet of the Apes"" story is a microcosm of racism and classism and how opposable thumbs are the coolest by far, that sort of thing. The new movie is a microcosm of stupidity.  It's like that really obnoxious friend we all have that's hyperactive, vain, loud, and a lot less funny than s/he thinks.  The comic book had all but one human lobotomized or mute, leaving that one desperate guy with no other choice but to escape and find his ship again.  The apes were also a lot more scientific and a lot less animalistic, which in itself is quite frightening. But aside from the screeching and howling and Thade's ultra-hip armor, the apes in the new version aren't even all that scary.  There's nothing left to Burton's story but broad strokes of one-dimensional characters who just happen to be in the same place at the same time.  Just when it seems there will be the slightest bit of depth to anything, it vanishes like Charlton Heston's cameo.Grades for ""Planet of the Apes"":action: C plot: D acting: C- special effects: B- overall: D+/C-","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Except of course voting Charlton Heston to his rightful species. The story is decent sci-fi integrating humans, simians and robotics while taking the original story beyond the basics to challenge your imagination. The dialog though was uninspired with all the tired stereotypes with an ape/human twist. Like we haven't seen the original and endured the ironies the first time 'round.

Planet of the Apes had many good possibilities.  I was expecting to see a movie with political statements about humans and apes co-habiting a planet and the struggle to gain equality as an analogy to animal rights and civil rights struggles in the modern world.  Why I ever expected anything more than what this movie really is, is because I had faith in Tim Burton to remake and give new birth to an older conception.  I feel that the audience was robbed.  Tim Burton has made nothing but a summer blockbuster. Just about everything about this movie was down right horrible.  Why a brilliant actress like Bonham Carter would have signed on to a film like this is inscrutable.  There were points in this movie where it had potential. Perhaps a longer look at the lifestyles of the evolved apes in the city, or even an examination of the scattered human villagers and their daily lives would have proved worthwhile.  This would have given Burton more leverage to work in some of his normally fascinating set designs.  However most of the scenery looks like a 30x30 set of plastic plants.  The make-up of the apes was impressive, but this does not make up for the lack of story-line, development, dialogue or plain ol logic.  Any promising political ideal introduced is later destroyed by unexplained actions of apes or humans. The characters are 2 dimensional. they are cliché characteristics of any action movie villain, hero, damsel, and comrade. Although it seems like the actors put in quite an effort with nothing to work with. This movie could have easily been made by the likes of John Mcteirnan or James Cameron. Maybe I have given Tim Burton too much credit, or anticipated way too much out of his capabilities.  Really when you consider it Burton has made very few satisfying films.  Much with the help of Johnny Depp, Ed Wood, Edward Scissorshands,  even Nightmare Before Christmas.  With all of these notable films audiences  have gotten many more disappointments, Mars Attacks, Batman Returns, and now Planet Of The Apes.  Maybe Burton's next effort will heal these open wounds.  I hate to see a genius such as Burton sell out his artistic vision.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Yes, there were several references throughout the movie on the morality of treating fellow humans, apes or any walking-and-talking being alike with respect and contempt.  But there is a difference between this year's version and the original classic starring Charlton Heston.In 1968, the original `Planet of the Apes' revolutionized the sci-fi genre through its shocking image of mankind's future on the Planet Earth.  Of how an inferior species such as the apes could grow in power and intelligence to rule over humans, largely because mankind itself had used weapons of mass destruction on each other, therefore contributing to a series of events leading to ape domination.  Because the 1960s were such a turbulent time both politically and socially for the American people, the youth could especially empathize with the film's antiwar message.  I'm sure no baby boomer will ever forget the gut-wrenching conclusion of Heston pounding his fists on the beach sands and damning all of humanity to hell after feasting his eyes upon a half-buried Statue of Liberty.  Such scenes reflected the frightening times of the Cold War and Vietnam War, both looming as a shadow over the U.S. and other countries during that decade, and the whole movie itself directly reflected the mood of the times.Burton's version is quite a departure since it focuses on simple adventure entertainment and stunning visuals rather than any symbolic metaphor on the dangers of a worldwide engagement in nuclear war, or for that matter, any epidemic.  Instead of Planet Earth being the venue, Burton seems to have taken us to another world in another galaxy, therefore giving us a fresh take on the apes story.  At least this time around, the human slaves have the ability to talk.  I will never forget such scenes as Mark Wahlberg's pet chimpanzee landing in his space capsule from the sky during the climax of the ape-human battle.  These and other highlights made `Planet of the Apes' the escapist formula it deserves to be.  There are many inside dialogue references to the original `Apes' film, but I suggest you go see that version first in order to catch them all here.The movie is also blessed with a bunch of gifted performers.  Mark Wahlberg is OK as the chief protagonist.  But Tim Roth practically steals every scene he is in as the villainous ape general Thade.  With his experience as a stage actor, Roth magnificently portrays an enemy who is thoroughly corrupt and demonic with no hint of remorse.  Helena Bonham Carter provides an example of simian benevolence through her open-minded chimpanzee character. And Michael Clarke Duncan, being the huge man that he is, is at times terrifying as a gorilla commander.  Oh, and yes, keep an eye out for cameo appearances by Heston and Linda Harrison, stars from the original `Apes' movie.One common element between the two versions of `Planet of the Apes' is that both have a shocking finale, but for those who have not seen either, I will go as far as that!  For sheer pleasure, I rate this 8/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In its defense, the movie has a charm that I can't resist.  The special effects, while nothing to write home about, are good.  The makeup effects are brilliant.  The story is interesting and involving.  But overall, the movie seems a little undercooked.That is a weird feeling to have in a Tim Burtin movie.  His movies are filled with gorgeous and unusual visuals, unusual characters, and flat-out different ideas.  But this ""re-imagining"" of Planet of the Apes does not seem like a Burtin movie.  It does not have crazy visuals, interesting characters, or anything unusual.  The movie is dry as it can be.  It's filled with crap dialog.  The actors look like apes, but when they speak it sounds like they have a cold (due to the large amount of makeup, but it could have been fixed with dubbing or something).I think that the movie had a large amount of potential, but it was not left in the oven for long enough.  Fox really rushed this movie and it shows. Not in the special effects, but in the story.Not all of the dialog is bad.  There are some nice punches here and there. But the over all script seems rushed.The characters flat out suck.  I'm sorry, but they do.  Especially the astronaut Leo played by Mark Wahlberg.  His character never seems shocked or amazed at this planet full of apes.  There is a moment of adjustment, but he gets used to it too quickly.  If some one dropped me on a planet full of apes, I would freak out and I think most other people would too.  Honostly, his character is rather boring and not interesting.  The only good characters are Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) the ape that has a soft side for humans, Limbo (Paul Giamatti) an ape slave trader, and possibly Attar (Michael Clark Duncan) an ape soldier.  But everyone else just seems, well, boring.One real gripe I have is with Tim Roth who plays the ape general Thade.  He does a good job, but he breaths real heavily and it gets annoying.  He tries to act like a total ""Evil monster"" but it would have been better had they just made him into a more emotional guy.  It's fine that they made him into a fearless psychopath, but it would have made the beginning moments (where Thade talks about his love for Ari) more believable.The best part of the movie is the fabulous, Twilight Zone ending that I would never dream of giving away.Over all, the movie seems lackluster and, well, boring.  It's not a bad movie, but I think had they had more time to work on it, it could have been truly great.  I liked the first movie a great deal, but I really wasn't looking forward to this too much.  I guess I sort of sensed it would be this way.  It is worth seeing, but it still lacks a narrative force that makes me want to see it again.  It's sad that they didn't take more time with this, because it had GREAT potential.  Oh well, it's still better than most of the crap that's out.  Except AI.  AI is still the best movie of the year, in my opinion.  Don't bring the kids.6/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Disappointing movie, could have benefitted from better editing.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511895/?ref_=tt_urv","lma-2","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0775052/?ref_=tt_urv","29 July 2001","I can't stand movies where the characters are stupid.  The new Planet of the Apes immediately got off on the wrong foot with me when in the first few minutes of the movie Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlberg) disobeys his commanding officer and takes a pod cruiser from the station.  It's stupid and it makes no sense.  The script writers could have come up with a dozen better ways to get him out into the storm in the pod.  It just makes the characters unbelievable from the start.Once we're down on the planet, things move along, but we don't seem to make any real progress in character development.  Why does Ari (Helena Bonham-Carter) care so much for the humans?  What's with Karubi (Kris Kristofferson)?  He shows up, but the character never develops.  Daena (Estella Warren) is easy on the eyes, but contributes little else. Ultimately I didn't really care all that much about these people.  There was no outpouring of sympathy from the audience when any of the characters died. That's because no one cared.I could possibly accept the complete lack of characterization if this were an action flick.  It failed there also.  The climactic fight sequence needs re-editing.  The climax was incredibly slow moving.  The pacing during the climax was all wrong.  For no apparent reason, this kid that we barely see and know nothing about (Birn, played by Luke Eberl) is all over this sequence.  Why?  Please, cut him, or at least make us care about him.  The climax needs to be tightened up a lot.Leo also manages to reinforce his stupidity with his plan (or lack thereof) for the climactic battle sequence.  Why blow your one big shot on the initial charge?  Why not come up with a plan that take advantage of your enemies obsession to make a bigger dent in the attacking army?  I like movies where the characters are smart or clever, again the characters just stumble along here with barely a semblance of a plan.  (Leo's escape sequence earlier in the movie suffers from the same problems.  He gets away, but it's mostly dumb luck.)The conversion of Attar (Michael Clarke Duncan) is also just not believable.All of this could have been fixed with a better script and better editing. Perhaps what disappointed me most was that you could see a good movie stuck behind this mess.  I can't help but feel that with just a little more work on the script and with better editing this could have been a good movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The make up is top noch, and thank god burton hates to make any overkill CGI efects, that plagues many of new Hollywood ""super productions"" And for all of the people crying about that humans ""did talk"" heres Burton´s view of it:second striking difference in the re-imagined APES is the fact that the planet's homo sapiens can actually talk. If you recall, the original portrayed humans more as animals (much like how apes are seen today), hunted and caged for sport by intelligent (almost human) apes. In Burton's film, the dichotomy between the two species presents a truer political allegory  a more spot-on metaphor for socialComing to this planet [at this point in] its evolution where the apes are still retaining some of their primal instincts, even if they're at odds with themselves  you have some apes that are kind of moving more humanesque, you've got apes that are wanting to maintain their apedom and you've got people who still talk. Eventually, the history of this planet will probably go the way [of the original], but the human's self-esteem is still being beaten out of them at this stage.'My complains? yes how the hell Estella Waren keeps a incredible make up all the movie, please!!! make it ugly and dirty, even few scars heeheSimply the best of this summer, and i really love the ala Twiligth Zone ending!!!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Some of the movie was really good. But most of it just didn't work. Let's get to it. 1. The Good; The Make-Up; There are only two words to describe Rick Baker's make-up: In-genious. The guy has always been the best and now he has surpassed even himself. His ape-make-up is flawless. Even apes with a short amount of screen time have amazing detail and individuality in their features. Baker easily has an Academy Award coming for his work here. The Acting; The Best Actors wore the most make-up. Everyone in an ape suit busted their butt and delivered first rate performances. Maybe they had to work harder to overcome wearing tons of make-up, maybe I just credit them with good acting because they were wearing all that make-up, all I know is that the made up actors were more expressive and convincing than the barefaced actors. 2. The Bad. They cut out it's brain, those bloody baboons! Sorry, I coudn't resist. That's a line from the original movie. It gets the point across. All the great satire that the original possessed is gone,cut out, eliminated. The book was mostly social satire and the original movie was pretty true to that. But not this one. It flirts with satire,it dabbles in it,it buys a ticket to the game but never gets into the same ballpark as the original movie as far as the satire and social commentary. It's watered down. I know they were excpecting lots of kids to flock to this flick, but I think the apes brutality was really underplayed. I'm not even talking about violence , much of which occurred off screen. Except for Thade and the profiteer Limbo, the apes weren't all that nasty to the humans. There is even an Animal Rights group that supports Human Rights. I never felt the overwhelming,oppressing menace that I felt with the original movie. Also, when the two big silverbacks locked up for their Big Fight, it was so anti-climactic. I expected fur and blood to fly when the arch-rivals met, instead I saw a slap fight between two mincing flight attendants. The Acting; Amazingly, all the actors without make-up were about as emotive as a wooden bedpost. There was no need for the humans to talk in this version, none of them said anything worth hearing. That's it. I hate, and I mean I really hate to say it but the ""Making of.."" video is a better time","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As a stand-alone I guess it is quite alright. When compared to the original, it is weak. If one doesnt make the mistake of comparing the two of them, then one can really enjoy it in a standard-action-movie kind of way. The original was very politically charged and had a philosophy behind. This remake was a pure action flick, no deep thoughts here. Tim Burton is as always an excellent director so the movie is visually pleasant to watch. The ending wasnt too good. I can see the idea behind it but it failed miserably and just left a bad aftertaste.

I found it much more entertaining than the hideous Mummy Returns, and the boring, uninteresting Final Fantasy.Like most 'block buster' movies these days this flick is tops in the C.G.I department but woefully lacking in the plot department. However...BEST STUFF:The apes. Their costumes and makeup were excellently rendered. Their mannerisms were convincingly ape-like (e.g. the tree climbing, the loping gait, fear of water), and they were well-performed by their actors. (Thade, Ari and that elderly Orangutan slave trader come to mind)The different species of apes living together in the ape city. Some of the best ape make up I've seen had to be that huge Orangutan with the enormous cheek pouches and jowls. I liked the idea of chimps, gorillas and Orangutans living together in one big community. The set designs were very pretty.  There's lots and lots of picturesque visuals to look at.NOT SO GREAT STUFF:The human hero. Marky Mark may do better in Funky Bunch music videos (!!) and underpants commercials but he was completely uninteresting here. Spends most of his time running around but hardly looks like he is in any danger. Boring. Thankfully the apes get more screen time than M.M.
The Humans. 99% of the humans in this movie were merely extras in cave man clothes given very little to do. There's supposed to be a romance between M.M and Blonde Cave Girl (B.C.G) but nothing happened (maybe I missed something). Her character seemed to have been added simply to make B.C.G look prettier than the ape woman!The story. Oh dear. I liked this movie for the apes, but the humans and been-done-before plot spoiled it! The numerous holes in the plot must be deliberately ignored in order to enjoy this movie. Why not just forget the humans and have the whole flick about the apes? THE ENDING. It's yet another (SIGH) Hollywood'ised End Act! It's meant to be a shock ending, but surprise, surprise: IT SUCKED!! But it does pave the way for POTA part II!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The story evolves around a space mission that goes wrong when a space pilot is transported into the future to a place where human beings are ruled by the apes.  The dilemma for the pilot is simple in that he wants to get back to his original era but to do so he must put his faith in those he knows little about, not least a female ape who has rebelled against the brutal treatment of humans. Wahlberg's performance is a little stilted for my money and the typical gung-ho swashbuckling American hero comes through in trumps but he cares little for the land he leaves behind.  The scenery is superb and the way the apes move and react and indeed look is amazing.  There are a number of sub plots, but the most interesting one evolves around the whole scenario of totalitarian ape rule.  Helena Bonham Carter's performance is excellent and I felt a sense of real urgency about her personal quest.  The film all boils down to the stand off near the end whereby some of the militaristic apes learn the truth about their existence in that they were once controlled by humans.  All in all a good movie that was enjoyable, but could have focused more on the inter-race relations and a little less on the selfish quest of Wahlberg's character to just get the hell out of there!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I left the movie feeling that I had been well entertained. The magicpecial effects, make-up, musical score all produce a feast of movie fantasy. The ape-ing is inspired. Tim Roth, as the fanatical Chimp General, is worth the price of admission alone. Paul Giamatti has some nice moments, but no-one else is given much to do except to imitate apes or fearful humans. The female chimps look too much like the original Kim Hunter, bereft of facial hair and facial creases.As usual with these kinds of movies the throw away line is ever present, and some make for a good snicker or two. I wonder how many people caught the irony of Charlton Heston defending gun control!It's really best to see this movie with your inner child on your lap, and leave the critical adult home.

Tim Burton brings his unique bag of tricks to a film that is perhaps uniquely suited to them. His dark Gothic visuals blend surprisingly well with the topic. The plot contains much of his trademark satire, which replace the heavy moralising of the first film and makes for lighter, more summereaque fare. The cast has its ups{Helana Bonham Carter and Tim Roth being the standouts} and downs {most of the human actors seem to be chosen for their physical archetypes}. The Danny Elfman music is superb as always, adding to the powerful action scenes which stress the sheer physical strength pf the apes . The only major criticism I have is the bizarre ending, which does come as a small shock to those who haven't had it given away for them by some useless trailer trash. But it doesn't mesh well with the rest of the film and actually to me makes a sequel harder to visuallize. All in all, I think this movie is the most entertaining film this summer {altho' that's not saying a lot}, worth your time and money and deserving of better reviewers {both for and against} than have been shown here so far.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Don't call it a remake. Director Tim Burton (Sleepy Hollow) prefers words such as ""reenergizing,"" ""reimagining,"" or ""reinventing."" He even went so far as to request of Fox Studios that the name of the movie be changed to The Visitor. That request was vetoed, as well as the hot monkey love scene between ape and human that was in the original ""reinventing"" of the 1968 sci-fi classic (which was written by Rod Serling, based upon a much-lauded novel by Pierre Boulle). In this version, Mark Wahlberg (A Perfect Storm) plays the Charlton Heston role, sans loincloth (nope, not what you're hoping for ladies -- Marky-Mark insisted on being fully clothed from head to toe here). He's Leo Davidson, an astronaut who crash-lands on the mysterious, dangerous planet inhabited and ruled with an iron paw by intelligent apes. Helena Bonham-Carter (Fight Club) plays Ari, the ""human rights activist"" type chimp who risks her life to help the astronaut, and buxom blonde Estella Warren (Driven) completes the strange, almost love triangle. Tim Roth (Lucky Numbers), who excels in playing the villain, goes bananas here with furry malice as the militant human-hater, Thade. I'm reluctant to use the word disappointment here (I'm sure Burton could help me come up with a more imaginative one), and I wouldn't were this not a Tim Burton Film. I hold him to a higher standard than I do most other directors, and I was expecting to see his quirky stamp all over this movie. Unfortunately, it wasn't there. The landscapes and overall look of the film are relatively Burtonesque (thanks to his Sleepy Hollow production designer, Rick Heinrichs and the excellent cinematographer Philippe Rousselot, who is a first-timer to the Burton camp). But the feel of the movie, the heart of it, was not what I have come to expect from Burton. Had this version of Planet of the Apes come out by any other director, I would have judged it less harshly. The ape makeup, aside from the too-glamorous females, is expertly done by Rick Baker, who is no stranger to the celluloid simian. He did the makeup effects for Gorillas in the Mist and Mighty Joe Young. I predict he'll be at least nominated for an Academy Award for his work on Planet of the Apes. The atmosphere of this film is darkly fantastic -- from the makeup, to Danny Elfman's score, to Heinrichs' sets -- it's just too bad the atmosphere does nothing more than shroud a pretty standard story and stock characters. There was some cheesy dialog and tired stunts (for example, a young boy who insists on fighting against the ape army is pinned beneath his horse -- for no apparent reason -- as the enemy closes in upon him. Don't even bother wondering how horses evolved on the planet from the original stock of apes and humans.). Don't get me wrong: Planet of the Apes is definitely a worthy popcorn flick, and will surely be one of this summer's biggest blockbusters. The money is all up there on the screen (Burton wriggles out of saying just how much by stating it cost ""More than X-Men, less than Titanic""). There's great action and super-exciting chases and battle scenes, and the actors are fine despite the fact their characters are pretty one-dimensional (the most fully-realized character is Bonham-Carter's, though her Cosmo-ape looks threw me off a bit). Perhaps the most engaging roles are the cameos: Lisa Marie is the sexy chimp trophy-wife of an orangutan senator, and Charlton Heston makes a memorable appearance saying the word ""damn"" as only he can, and holding a gun. Overall, I recommend Planet of the Apes for fun. Just don't expect anything more than a remake (sorry, Tim).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'm a fan of the original series and was looking forward to this version. Of course it has its bad points like some atrocious dialogue like ""..a human from the stars"" from Helena Bonham Carter but its a more ambitious film with more content and ideas than say Jurassic Park 3 which was just another tired franchise film. The ending was a fun homage to the original and was not supposed to top that original film but is a part of Tim Burton's reimaging. Mr Burton said in a recent interview that he would rather jump out of a window than make a sequel even though Fox want to turn it into a franchise so maybe there should not be a sequel but just let this film stand as a worth successer to the 1968 version. I can't wait for the DVD with the extras to savor from this excellent version. 10 out of 5","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The beginning is a nicely done introduction, letting you see what Mark Wahlburg's charachter is all about, he is the classic american hero He doesn't take orders well, which makes you wonder why he is in the Air force, but whatever, this Is an action movie, and the plot takes a side role to the suspense and fight scenes anyway.  The film wastes no time enslaving him, and wastes less letting him escape, it gets better after he leaves the hatefull city, and the interesting side plot about his divivded love between the gorgeous human, and the intelligent, compassionate ape.  The final battle does an excellent job of tying up all the loose ends, both by fulfilling the ancient prophecy, and taking care of the antagonist Thade. There my like for the film evaporates as Tim Burton ends it with something only one large fan of the original series has been able to explain to me as ""jumping to another dimension"". I don't know about you, but ""another dimension"" is code for, ""the writers ran out of GOOD ideas"". the biggest shock of all comes after you've seen the film, and then realize that Mr.Burton shot an additional 4 DIFFERENT endings, and THIS is the one he chose! overall: two hours of entertainment, followed by 10 minutes of mysterious crud.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The original Apes' films fell in the latter camp, using the generation gap of the late 60s, the optimism and expectancy of the moon shots and (increasingly) the racial tensions building up in the states as its themes. Tim Burton's film does neither, living with the glib message that ""we should, uh, just all get along and live with each other"".Though there's a fair amount of spectacle to enjoy and a cracking performance from Tim Roth, POTA is ultimately unsatisfying. Up to this point in his career Burton was part of that small (miniscule?) group of American directors who had managed to deliver witty, scary, ironic, enjoyable films AND managed to get them distributed to your local McMultiplex. POTA sadly whiffs of compromise and poor editing ending up being confused and confusing.Go and see it (at the end of the day it IS fun) but don't let the phrase ""hang on, why...?"" appear in your mind at any point and don't be be tempted to wonder that if, in 30 years during which we've been able to shrink computers to a tenth of their size and digital watches have come and gone, monkey make-up still looks as ropey as it did when Roddy McDowell first started piling it on to spook Charlton Heston.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was such an incredibly moving film and was so brilliantly well done.  Even the 1968 ape make-up was amazing.  So when the 2001 film came out, I was anticipating seeing it.My first sitting of the film was somewhat mixed.  The opening progresses quite quickly and jumps straight into the point rather than dilly-dallying with any character development.  There was an awful lot that happened in the film, and I didn't really get the chance to process it all until after the film had finished.  That's not to say that the plot was hard to follow; it just took me a while to process everything that had happened.  During that delayed reaction, I commented rather negatively on the film, but once I'd processed it all I appreciated the film a lot better, and thus the film was much better.During my second viewing of the film, I saw it for what it was: really good sci-fi action film.  That's not to say that the re-working of the film is a bad thing: the remake gives a fresh angle on the ape concept, which can be a great thing if it's executed correctly.  And the 2001 version of ""Planet of the Apes"" executes it brilliantly.In the modern film, genetically-enhanced monkeys pilot survey pods through unexplored space while the humans stay safely on their space station.  When one such monkey is lost in an electromagnetic storm, pod pilot Leo Davidson (Mark Wahlburg) decides to attempt a rescue.  With his navigation instruments down, Leo crash-lands on the planet of the apes....just as an ape hunting party is rounding up a fresh wagon-load of human slaves.Critics will say that the new film completely ignores Pierre Boulle's original novel, but it doesn't.  The modern story is very different certainly, but it is still closely tied with the novel.  Human-sympathising ape Ari (rendered absolutely superbly by Helena Bonham Carter) suggests a reason for why Earth's apes don't speak (""the way you treat them; maybe they don't want to""), which comes from Boulle's original novel.  And the movie's ending (one that'll make you gasp out loud) is lifted straight from the original novel.Everything about this film is excellent: the modern ape make-up is amazing, the peformances are of an incredible standard (especially Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth as the human-hating ape Thade), and the characterisation is just as superb as in the original film.  The film is brutal enough to make a statement about man's inhumanity to man (and ape), yet there is still a definite humour in the ape parodies of society.This truly is a great film.  Go out and enjoy it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Like many others, I have been a huge fan of the original Planet of the Apes since I first saw it in 1968 and had great misgivings about a remake. Once I learned that Tim Burton was to direct I knew that I would be seeing something wonderful. There isn't any other director around today that I would have picked to make this film. I was also delighted to learn that he was not just remaking but re-imagining the entire story which opened up huge possibilities. The result is an exciting, rousing adventure with thought-provoking ideals that set it apart most of the bang and blow-up action films put out today. It manages to keep many of the elements of the original that made it so enduring while adding new twists to the story. The make-up by Rick Baker is astounding. Certainly his best work to date. The cast is uniformly excellent with special kudos to Helena Bonham-Carter, Tim Roth and Paul Giamatti. This film must be seen on the big screen. I'll certainly be seeing it again at least once if not more.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Happy for her, but that was her only purpose in the whole movie! Why was she the only one to be running around half naked and with her cleavage showing(Maybe apes don't have cleavage)? Maybe I was supposed to be so blinded by her lips that I didn't notice that the little girl(that was taken as a pet and then rescued) seemed to disappear. Maybe I fell asleep and missed something, but what happened to her? I don't remember seeing her after that. I guess you can't have a movie without the token woman and cute kid, even if it is ridiculous. Another thing...since when do apes fly around like Peter Pan? I think a simple jump would have sufficed.

When talk first began about an update for ""Planet of the Apes"" I was taken back when it was first reported that Arnold ""The Terminator"" Schwartzenegger was tapped to play the lead in the James Cameron directed film.  Thank all that is wholly that Burton took over. Could anyone really see Arnold delivering such lines as ""get your stinking hands off me you damned dirty ape!"" Talk about your comedy films.Burton, who is probably best known for his dark and mysterious works such as ""Batman"" (the first one and only really worthy one) and ""Sleepy Hollow"", has scored once again with his retelling of ""Planet of the Apes""  By showing a certain reverence to the original ( the above referenced line by Heston is now spoken by one of the apes ) as well as certain character names (Nova for one) he has given it an original twist and (although I must admit a somewhat confusing) ending that will have people talking in the breakroom for days about it.The actors, story all of it is first class and well worth the admission price.  Remember, these aren't your 1968 apes.  Burton has them behaving less human and more ape-like, complete with hanging off the ceiling and grunts and squeals.  But then again, when a director like Tim Burton takes on a project as daunting as ""Planet of the Apes"" he must feel the pressure of having the monkey on his back.This is two hours of make believe that will do just that -- make you believe.  enjoy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was expecting another duplicate of Planet Of The Apes '68 with hyped-up special effects and celebrity actors (well it did, but they where apes).  Acting was ok, Wahlberg was not that great (loosen up man, it's just a movie), but found Tim Roth, Paul Giamatti, and Carter to be very entertaining.  We got a completely stand-alone movie that went in a different direction than the other five films with the same namesake (or maybe not, we may see...).  I can see where alot of people may not like this movie. For one, I think too many people went into the movie thinking it was going to be more closely related to previous films, from what I understand they where not even going to call it ""Planet Of The Apes"". Overall it is nothing spectacular, a few nice surprises on the way, but equal to most action/sci-fi movies out there nowadays.  As for the ending, come on people, not every single big-budget movie has to have a happy, close-minded, all mysteries solved ending.  It's refreshing to have a thought-provoking ending.  Although, I did find that the apes driving cars and all that a little awkward looking, not because they are apes, but something just did not look right, and somehow if this whole thing was supposed to be a two-way time travel deal and the apes took over years and years ago, I would think that cars, buildings, and so on would look slightly different, then again maybe they took over a few years before he got there in the end, who knows?  In most cases, sequels can kill a series of movies, but in this case I think it can only get better if written and directed correctly.  One thing is for sure, I am sure they could get the audience and sales for a second movie just based on people wanting a resolution to that ending!  I got stuck watching the crappy pan & scan version and to me the shots where framed way to contrived for a movie like this, then again maybe I just need to see the widescreen version.

Did they spend a ton of dough to make it? Yes. Is it a blockbuster like Armageddon, Independence day and the like? Almost. Did Shrek and even American Pie 2 make more money (which means more warm bodies and eyeballs)? You bet. Without giving away the weak plot, Tim Burton has screwed up, and had his first bad story, bad acting and his first sell-out. When analyzing a movie, I look at the director's choices: cast, editing style, photography, dialogue and subtext. Cast: Mark Wahlberg deserves a huge movie, he deserves the cash and the popularity. Michael Clark Duncan is typecast as a big tough guy. Tim Roth plays a good bad guy. Helena Bonham Carter could have been replaced by anybody. The savage humans were poorly used, and where did the female human store her MAC makeup kit? Editing: Typical use of quick cuts, swish pans, high speed shutter shots, typical of current batch of action films, usually disguising a bad action sequence. Photography: adequate, did not give away effects, slow motion overused in action sequences. Dialogue: Terrible. Granted, even the Star Wars films have crappy dialogue, but the actors pull it off. Much of the conversation is trite, and the exposition is blatant. The humans should not speak, making the astronaut all the more unusual to the humans and the apes. Subtext: Not enough of it. They hardly touch upon the whole issue of the sensitive apes wanting to free the humans. And the sappy speech by Helena about the human who came from the stars...gimme a break.That being said, the makeup was good for the men, bad for the women, overdone for the female human lead. The sets were overdone. If they had metal helmets and spears and shields, why are the cages made out of wood. The whole time for bed escape scene was too campy for this film. Finally, as a movie that keeps one's interest, this movie fails. About 30 minutes in, I wondered if it was over yet. Thank goodness it's over now. Rule the Planet? I'm afraid not, Tim. Stick to superheroes and Johnny Depp. And if you've got Kris Kristoferson on your payroll, I think the world is ready for Pee-Wee Herman and the Last Crusade.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The tacit love scenes among mark Wahlberg and her are touching. It's amazing how humans can feel threatened all the time . Estella Warren's worship of Mark Wahlberg is challenged by Carter's enthusiasm and worship of the humans. By having this love triangle in this kind of movie plot, Tim Roth did an excellent job potraying humans versus apes, their likes and dislikes. The last scene , to many a confusing ending with different interpretation, is the best scene.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

What I saw can be simply and honestly summarised. Special effects (the least consideration of any cinema-goer whose IQ achieves triple figures), very good. Make-up, very good (Thade especially). Mark Wahlberg's acting, monosyllabic and wooden. Helena Bonham-Carter's acting, a little better than her usual low average. In my native England this movie carries a 12 rating (i.e. suitable for viewers of age 12 and over), which slightly over-estimates the level of intellectual maturity required. A complete absence of plot and character, but a superabundance of noise and violence. Much jumping and gratuitous aggression from the apes, considerable banality from the humans (especially Wahlberg). Given the considerable resources available to Burton we are entitled to something considerably less moronic than this flimsy, catchpenny movie, which cynically exploits brand loyalty and the reputations of director and cast. The truth is that this film will not bear scrutiny six months from now, let alone in a decade or so's time. None of this will matter. Mugs like myself have ensured that it was a box-office smash. More fool us.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Time and again, Burton has disregarded the entire concept of suspension of disbelief, and that's fine, but when the end of your film is as ludicrous as that of the new Planet of the Apes, it makes one forget the positives the film may have presented. Not as good as the original (what remakes are?), I found everything in the film to be 'acceptable', even some of the cheesier heroic scenes from the Wahlberg character, but the ending just went too far. That drastically changed my impressions of the film, which I was thinking of as a 5 or a 6 until the finale reduced it to a 3.

The romance subplot does not overtake the movie and is not very obvious. The direction, with Tim Burton at the helm, would have to be said as really good. Like a music CD can have good songs badly produced (or vice versa), this is a pretty good movie with a great director. The dark sides of other films like Edward Scisorhands and Batman don't influence the style of ""Apes"", and the genre allows him to play with things.

First of all the film moves so quickly and is edited so smoothly that the force of the ruling apes pulses through each frame. Thade, the fierce leader played by Tim Roth, intimidates the viewer and flies through the air to viciously end any who oppose him. I found myself recoiling everytime he took flight to horrify and kill a human. His is a villain I was truly afraid of, which is a first in a long while. The visual style of this film is uncanny, the colors and the tones of each scene and setting a complete feast for the eye. I could spend my life looking at this film and never tire of it. The sets and costumes are absolutely stunning and gorgeous - alot of it looks like it was designed by costume designer Eiko Ishioka (Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) and The Cell). Lisa Marie as Nova was hysterical. Miss Helena Bonham Carter is very pleasing to watch as always, and surprisingly Estella Warren, the blonde beauty, has very, very few lines and a very small part. An unnamed child who tags along has more lines than her. The film's pace is so brisk I thought by the first twenty minutes they were almost halfway through the movie, but then more and more happened and began to unfold. Some of the best discussions about religion, politics and slavery can be found in this film, making such a bold and correct statement about how though species may differ, their ideas that allow them to live due to belief in a higher power are all the same, on this planet or elsewhere. Religion is an invention of higher intelligence, though that's not to say that religion itself is intelligent - in fact it's rather illogical and nonsensical for a ""higher"" species such as ourselves. We consider our species so much ""better"" and ""perfect"" that we assume that if there is, in fact, a God, it made us in its likeness. If you think about it, we have never even entertained the notion that the higher power may in fact be something of a different species, if any at all. No, THAT'S absurd. (Roll of eyes). The action sequences were powerful and well directed, but that goes without saying, seeing as this IS a Tim Burton movie. I rather enjoyed that it wasn't Sleepy Hollow 2. Although that film is genius and Tim Burton's trademark, I'm glad he stretched his creative muscles and ventured into a different territory of filmmaking, at least in its style. Although his films carry a very similar theme - someone lost in a world of absurdity with very few but existing traces of sympathizers and saviors. Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes stands as its own film, and not a remake. It's powerful, philisophical, moving and fierce. It will leave its mark. In me it already has.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is more action-packed than the original in many ways. That's it.I saw the original again a few weeks ago and I thought, just because, let me pull out my dusty 2001 version. They have two things in common, period. They both have apes, they both have humans at a lower level.The incredible drama and interplay of conflicting beliefs such as racism, nuclear holocaust, intolerance, animal vivisection never appear in the newer version, so...and now I ask the obvious...WHY remake a classic with something only created for green screen shots?I can only come up with one answer and it saddens me. Very few of today's younger generations don't have the same attention span as ""us"" older folk. I can't imagine them sitting through (let's face it) the rather boring action-wise first few minutes of the film:but, the problem is, those first few minutes help to set up the entire movie; something the remake doesn't. I can imagine it would be like making a 16 year old sit through ""2001."" No zooming spaceships, no lasers, no action or fighting.I am vehemently opposed to most remakes. Granted, there might be a handful at most that improved upon the original, ""Dracula"" pops to mind, but very, very few. I wish directors would get some imagination and try to think of something PARTIALLY new. I know the Bible, Ecclesiastes 1:9, said, ""there is nothing new under the sun,"" but come on. If you can't do any better than a remake it's time to hang up your directing hat and go fishing until retirement.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Sure you can quibble about the details, but I grabbed the kids and took them to see it when it first came out and no one was disappointed. We all got a kick out of it and afterward we rented the original so that we could compare. The kids thought the newer version was better, but I suppose a lot of that has to do with the updated technology and all. Now that they've gotten hip to DVDs and all the features they include, they want me to get it for all the inside stuff so I suppose I'll preorder it here. The make-up jobs in this film were certainly much better than in the original. I expect that will make its category at the Oscars. I had no problem with the acting, Tim Roth is always great, look forward to anything he's in. I didn't get Wahlberg's performance till I thought about it a bit more and realized that was his character, a bit selfish and tunnel-visioned. He kind of deserved the ending ; ). And I rather enjoyed seeing a different version and wouldn't mind seeing more directors do this. Seeing the second version of Psycho mimicked shot for shot left me cold. This version of Planet of the Apes still dealt with the important issues and I'm glad for that. We all had a lot of discussion about the nature of human behavior and how we all need to get along somehow. I know the cynics are scowling now, but its true. I see some folks don't get the ending and I'm not sure I do either. Perhaps that was intended, because it was left wide open for a sequel. Anyway, I'm not going to quibble, it was enjoyable and fun to watch, worth the money.

Having seen Batman, Beetlejuice and Mars Attacks! I am surprised to see this unwelcome addition to his list. To be fair though, this is probably his first mediocre film. Its not a disaster and it has its good moments, but there's not enough fresh material in it to make it very memorable. Mark Wahlberg is the film's `hero' but the role really doesn't suit him. While in films like Boogie Nights and The Yards he had good supporting players, in Planet of the Apes he just can't carry the role. On the other hand, Tim Roth is very moody in his role as Thade, the film's menace. Helena Bonham Carter is good as the female monkey with a heart, but the make-up is unconvincing. Most of the other performances are standard but nothing award-winning. The film's direction is surprisingly bland giving Burton's usual atmospheric style. There has been a lot of controversy about the ending. I for one liked it and although it was a big surprise, I thought it was very clever. Overall, Planet of the Apes isn't a bad movie, but it could have been much better. It's good fodder for the eyes but after watching it, you'll probably forget about it straight away. 5.3 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I give this film an 8 out of 10, go see it at any price, you won't be disappointed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I went in pumped up but left feeling disappointed because I probably expected too much.  They did a good job distancing themselves from the original film.  This film has a surprise ending that's not as good as the one in the original (which is my favourite ending in ANY film) but is still very nightmarish.  Unfortunately this movie's mid section drags mercilessly and I wanted to leave the theatre.  It starts off very well and ends well in the last 40 minutes or so but about 45 minutes in the middle of the film is just plain bland.  Mark Wahlberg wasn't well casted.  I didn't buy him as an astronaut and adventurer at all. Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan and especially Tim Roth all have their characters nailed down perfectly.  Roth's General Thade may be one of the top five villains in movie history.  The savage nature of his portrayal made him a great sadist and the make-up spoke a lot for him as well.  Rick Baker could earn another Oscar for his make-up work but Tim Burton was not the man to direct such heavy material.  Burton is good for decorative pop culture stuff found in comic books ('Batman') or heavy indoor and artsy production design stuff like 'Pee Wee's Big Adventure' or 'Beetlejuice' but somehow he just couldn't get me excited enough to embrace this remake of a legendary motion picture.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Here is the best film of 2001 so far bar none! Critics are just critics, and will never be able to enjoy a movie without picking it apart. This was a marvelous film in so many ways. The script is extremely well written and keeps you guessing. In the end you'll be dazzled and confused, but no less amazed! What made this film so enjoyable was the grand sense of humor and pacing. It was never boring and some of the apes were hilarious. The ending, which has been much talked about, is wonderfully twisted and different than usual. Wouldn't it have been boring if Wahlberg just came back to Earth with a happy ending? Knowing Tim Burton you know something weird had to happen. Wahlberg gave a great performance as the earnest astronaut. From the opening scenes I knew this film would be great. The credits sequence was extremely imaginative and beautifully done. Everything in the film was superbly done. Ape City was truly eye-popping. I couldn't tell if it was done by computer or models. I loved Charlton Heston's little cameo. He really explained the mechanics of the story in just one scene. And it's a fascinating story at that. I highly recommend this film. It's probably best if you haven't seen the original, since I haven't and I really enjoyed this one. So go see it and have an old-fashioned good time at the movies. Best summer action film of the year.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It isn't a cold war commentary which has deep and philosophical things to say about man's innate desire to destroy himself.  It doesn't have silly looking ape masks or NRA president Charlton Heston kneeling before the Statue of Liberty yelling ""they blew it up!!!""  It couldn't have these things because for what it's trying to be in this time, none of the aforementioned details would have meaning.Let's face it folks, 1968 and 2001 by their very nature demand that two entirely different films be made (even if they both happen to be called Planet of the Apes).  As an intelligent, all be it wacky filmmaker, Tim Burton knew when he made the new film for the masses of 2001 that it would be viewed as little more than a mindless summer blockbuster, backed by all the advertising that the Hollywood machine can muster for one of its potential goldmines.  He knew that it wouldn't be considered ""art"" as the first has become since 1968, and he knew that Americans, by and large, don't want to see art at multiplexes during the summer (witness the demise of A.I.)This all considered, it's incredible to me that there is a preponderance of negative reviews for this film on the IMDB.  ""It has no plot.""  ""It has no good characters.""  ""It isn't the original.""  Of course it has a plot! (And don't say the ending made no sense because if you think about it for more than a minute, g-d forbid, it just may)  Of course it has good characters! Who do you think acted below all that (incredible) ape makeup!  BUT, as I have said already, I admit that it isn't the original.Tim Burton should be given a great deal of credit for putting this film together.  He did as good a job as can be done today for a film like this, given our society's need to be perpetually entertained.  The new Planet of the Apes has echos of its predecessor... not too many nor too few.  It is a remake, but it is its own film.  It is neither a masterpiece nor a disaster. If you've seen the original, think of these things when you enter the theater and you'll probably be happy when you leave.  If you haven't seen the original, first of all see it... second of all, see the remake.  It's a worthy update bringing 1968 up to 2001's speed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

No. Does ""Apes"" live up to such a potential? Not quite. Is Burton's ""Apes"" a bad film? Absolutely not. And this coming from one of the original's biggest fans. Where the original Apes film (note that I only refer to the first of the original series...no business involving underground A-bomb zealots or Ricardo Montalban as a circus master in this review, thank you very much) was more character driven and used social and political issues as its driving force, Burton opts for a richly visualized, humor-laced action film that features more Saturday-matinee gusto than most films I've seen in a long while. It's a different flavor of ice cream from the first folks, and it's still tasty. And while I won't give away the much-talked-about twist ending--which I quite enjoyed--I managed to find a perfectly logical (though mightily implausible) explanation for how it could have happened...and before the final credits even began rolling (based on elements laid out earlier in the film.) Misters Burton and Broyles must have done something right if I reached such a conclusion that quickly...and if I'm right, and they've done what I think they've done for the reasons I think they did them in that finale, I personally would love to see a sequel.

Estella Warren is as good as advertised as Daena--in the same science fiction sexpot role that Raquel Welch started in ONE MILLION YEARS, B.C., and that Linda Harrison improved upon in the original PLANET OF THE APES.  Warren looks even better than her predecessors, can run better, and can actually act.
Unfortunately, this PLANET OF THE APES has no flow, no focus, and none of the sense of isolation that Charlton Heston--who has a terrific cameo in this version!--made you feel in the original--how could one man survive on the Planet of the Apes???Wahlberg carries the movie, but when you get to the disappointing ending, instead of the feeling of awe at the end of the original, you have a feeling of ""I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!!""

"","","Tim Burton's Epitaph: He Did What He Could","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511723/?ref_=tt_urv","nunculus","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0404091/?ref_=tt_urv","27 July 2001","Critics are a little harsher on this semi-return-to-form from Tim Burton than I would have thought from how consistently engaging the picture is. While not as bewilderingly impersonal as SLEEPY HOLLOW, APES still bears the earmarks of a Fox  $100-million-dollar movie--which is to say that the third act takes a turn into James Cameron and GLADIATOR territory that is most unwelcome (and seems designed to provide gung-ho trailer fodder).Audiences will probably be divided by the finale, an attempt to recoup the badum-bum finale of the 1968 APES; it's a little hamhanded, but I think it works. And the incredible deus ex machina that cuts short a not very well executed Maximus-style combat climax is so touching and out of left-field it feels almost Spielbergian. But until then, the movie works as a well-masticated mouthful of the original APES' hidden subtexts: Burton's APES proliferates metaphors of racism, animal rights, individual self-destruction, and militarism-versus-effete-government in virtually every scene. The themes buried in the Franklin Schaffner APES may not be as probingly essayed here as...oh, I dunno, they would be in a Todd Haynes movie. But they are rather surprising in the context of this very big movie--which, to Burton's everlasting credit, must be the lightest on action scenes of any blockbuster of its kind in years. The Burtonian wit is there--especially when Mrs. Burton, a k a Lisa Marie, does a simian dance of sex for her bloated orangutan husband, who trembles like Pontius Pilate ogling Salome. And it's there in Paul Giamatti's side-of-the-mouth quips as an amoral trader of human slaves. (This is the kind of humor George Lucas was attempting, and failing at grotesquely, in THE PHANTOM MENACE.) Much has been made of the ""flatness"" of Mark Wahlberg's performance as the human hero, but I think he gives the role just what's necessary--an unsentimental desire to get the job done and get out of Dodge. Much has also been made of the hambone-chewing, sucking and swallowing of Tim Roth, who plays the evillest of the apes; as with Ben Kingsley in SEXY BEAST, Americans seem to respond to British villainy when it's spelled out with a magic marker. Better performances come from Helena Bonham Carter, who weaves bits of chimpanzee physical behavior into her role as a tremulous human-rights activist--a sort of chimpish Patty Hearst--and even from the model Estelle Warren, who is perfectly credible opening her mouth and perfectly heart-stopping when closing it. The script is a sound one (even if there's a bit too much time spent following Wahlberg walk around a wilderness staring at a Palm Pilot-like compass) and Burton brings more flair to even the most expositional images than any of the other eligible hacks could possibly bring to bear. Since this movie is  guaranteed to make a sockful of loot, will somebody let Burton  make another ED WOOD or MARS ATTACKS?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Of course then the time to an observer moving at that speed would seem to slow down relative to an observer outside of that frame of reference (time dilation effect).  This was explained by Albert Einstein in the early part of the last century.  Worm holes are another consequence of Einstein's relativistic theories. Regardless of how a being views the ""device"" that propels the travelers in both movies, I must concede that the first movie was better written, and that even in fantasy with a willing suspence of belief, there are certain rules of internal logic that should be followed. That is why so many people are struggling to make sense of this movie.  In a good movie one does not need to work that hard.  Dr. Who was a much better time traveler, and the writing was much more consistent.  Besides, the hero in this movie can't even fly a space pod as good as his ape assistant! Saying that this movie is as good as the original is like trying to say the ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire?"" requires the same brain power as ""Jeopardy.""","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","ending makes sense if you've read Boulle's novel","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512186/?ref_=tt_urv","rcantabile","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0857383/?ref_=tt_urv","6 August 2001","All the confusion over the ending is understandable if you have not read the original Pierre Boulle novel on which Planet 2001 (and its predecessor, to a much lesser degree) is based.Boulle spends a lot of time on evolutionary theories and we learn as the story develops that Cornelius, a very bright chimp scientist, is on the verge of a discovery that will destroy the foundations of the apes' beliefs concerning their evolutionary superiority.In Boulle's Ape world, the apes believe they have always been the intelligent ones and the humans have always been incapable of rational thought.  Cornelius discovers the opposite to be true during his archeological dig in the forbidden zone -- he finds among the ruins a human doll with a voice mechanism, which hints at the previous existence of a hi-tech society. (a similar scene occurred in Planet 1968).The real shocker comes towards the end of the novel, when Cornelius, desperate to show that apes are not just skillful imitators (he is afraid that this truth may explain their progress up to this point -- they have simply copied what humans have already done throughout history), demonstrates via shock therapy on human subjects that he and his colleagues can actually tap into HISTORICAL human memory and shock subjects into babbling about events that took place hundreds of years ago.
Some of the snatches of vocalized historical memory reveal that humans rested on their technological laurels, became lazy, and, before they knew it, apes had taken over their world.  Snatches of these ancient memories reveal that apes were hungry for knowledge while humans were hungry for leisure (what, humans hungry for leisure?!  never!)  The takeover was violent and humans were enslaved.  Fast forward to Boulle's planet Soror and you have apes in control and mute humans with brains turned to mush.When Boulle's hero Ulysse Merou heads back to earth, he too is shocked to discover that apes now rule his home turf.  Yet, how hard is this to believe when we've already seen what has happened on Soror?  The formula is well-understood by now.  Superior species accomplishes much and then loses its edge.  Formerly inferior species, long discriminated against, tortured, etc., takes advantage of human sloth and eventually assumes control.In Planet 2001 we have seen the same thing.  Leo returns to earth naively expecting it to be similar to the way it was when he left.  Thade is worshipped here for the same reasons he was feared/worshipped on his planet -- he is the alpha-warrior and leader of the apes.  What happens on Earth is similar to what happened on Boulle's Soror.  Human minds melted after too much television, pornography, and sports/entertainment.   Though Leo eventually went back in time to return to earth, he still had to make the trip back to earth and that means hundreds of years have passed while he's been in space.  Thade's legend is well-known throughout the cosmos at this point and we should not be surprised to see him worshipped on earth as well, where he's obviously been the inspiration for the ape takeover.One last note: during the feast at the senator's home early in the movie, we hear one of the table guests exclaim (paraphrase):  ""We're getting lazy, we should be careful lest the humans take over.""  This is a nice homage to Boulle, who works the reverse angle in his novel when the human electroshock subjects reveal through historical memory that it was the human race that dropped the ball the first time around.The lesson is clear:  let your mind melt and you will perish.  I think the homage just mentioned actually telegraphs the plot of the sequel, in which the apes will be corrupted by the same mindless entertainments that corrupt us today.  Leo will lead a revolt and a new breed of humans -- men and women hungry for literature and learning -- will rise up and reclaim their planet.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Do serious approaches exist in modern American cinema? Would ""Soylent Green"" contain line-after-line of Arnie's witticism if they were to make it now?I'm not a huge Science-Fiction fan - for the most part, because most of these films never suspend my disbelief - but they can work, and they only work when they're played straight.I know that on rewatching the original, many have commented on Heston's bad acting or the film's just plain silliness in places, but give it the one credit it deserves - it played the concept straight-as-die.Most detrimental comments of the original derive from a certain misplace nostalgia:On rewatching, we feel like the film lets us down in some way - That's because our memory of the film is stronger than the film itself, and it tells us that we should expect so much more because the incredible premise of the story has haunted so many of us for so many years.All I asked of the remake was that it treated the story respectfully.I knew I shouldn't go in there expecting a comparable ending or a scene-by-scene remake, but does a re-imagination mean we have to deal with Paul Giammatti's ridiculous slave trader, or Wahlberg's cardboard stock hero one-liners, Heston's embarrassing cameo or the Senator's wife's home-in-the-Hamptons dialogue?Take the remake's phenomenal art-direction, make-up and effects, (and Tim Roth's amazing performance) mix it with the originals heart and you'd have one hell of a movie. Instead we have an off-the-shelf, early 21st century popcorn pusher.

In fact, in terms of plot, character development, social commentary and even flat-out action, this remake not only doesn't hold a candle to the original, it isn't even on the same planet.  Having seen the original ""Planet of the Apes"" recently for the first time in many moons, I was impressed from start-to-finish, but especially impressed by the first five minutes in the spaceship, where Charlton Heston sets up everything that follows with a wonderful speech (into a recorder) about the passage of time on the ship as opposed to Earth and how he hopes it has resulted in a better world and society.  We all know what happens after he crash lands and finally finds the answer to all that has happened to him.  Here, we have Mark Wahlberg, a fine young actor who frankly can't hold a candle to Heston, and a completely meaningless fifteen minute opening in a spaceship that sets up absolutely nothing but cheap shocks and silly explanations some ninety minutes later.Without rehashing the inane plot, I'll just say what I liked about this movie as opposed to what I didn't like:  Helena Bonham Carter's Ari character and absolutely nothing else.  It wasn't funny, it wasn't suspenseful, it wasn't shocking, it wasn't exciting, it wasn't thought-provoking.  It was absolute monkeyshines, in other words.  Even terrific actors like Bonham Carter, Michael Clarke Duncan and Tim Roth couldn't elevate it for me.  None of the new characters could even hold a candle to the original's Cornelius, Zira and Taylor, and even Estella Warren's human ""love interest"" (who is totally ignored by Wahlberg's character throughout the film) compares unfavorably to Linda Harrison's Nova, which is pathetic considering she was the weakest link in the 1968 cast.  And what was with that totally unfunny slave trader character?  I felt the same way about him as I did Jar Jar Binks.  Put him out of our misery and do it fast!  Also, the film is grungy, dark and depressingly shot, easily one of the ugliest summer films I have ever seen.In short, I think I've made the point that I didn't like this movie.  And I won't even get into the totally bogus, unnecessary and implausible (to say nothing of dopey, incoherant and impossible considering everything else that has happened before it in the story) surprise ending, which appears to have been tacked on and serves as a surprise for no other reason than to supply a cheap shock that only the absolutely gullible will swallow.  Everyone else will feel cheated.  As a matter of fact, that is who this film is for: gullible fools who will swallow anything Hollywood spits out of its computer and be grateful for it.  For everyone else, you have been warned.  (1 out of possible 10)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I made the mistake of expecting something from this, um, 'pseudo-remake' of Planet of the Apes. It looked fantastic (the make-up and costuming was amazing...) and the score was rather intriguing...but the 'acting' was, well, sub-par (to put it nicely). I don't know what was going through Tim Burton's head.At no point during the film did I think that any of the characters (simian or otherwise) were believable. The dialogue (what there was of it, anyway) was appalling. Characters acted rashly for no logical reason, and there didn't seem to be any cause for these actions. The super-intelligent apes treated the humans like dirt...but why? There was no explanation for anything.The worst example of this lack of explanation comes at the end. I won't say what happens (don't want to ruin the 'fun' for everyone), but its absolutely impossible and it really doesn't make sense. Sure, it was jaw-dropping...but only since it was utter nonsense...As opposed to the original, I don't know what Burton's purpose was (other than <chi-ching> $$$). Well, in any case, kudos to Carter, Roth, Duncan and the rest of the apes for going to school and learning to act like an ape.

There wasn't much good in this movie that I could see. It starts off with a space ship that has a strange resemblance to the Quake symbol.  The space ship also somehow has gravity even though it doesn't spin or have any explanation as to how gravity is achieved.  The other thing that was kinda weird was that Marky Mark puts on a space helmet right over his t-shirt so if he was actually exposed to space he would die, it didn't even seal.Okay, the movie is okay, the costumes, and masks are great.  But obviously all the budget went to those rather than making a good movie.  It had great potential but just never got to the good level.The time travel isn't explained well enough and the obvious screwy ending is setting the viewer with a to be continued feeling. Suggesting that maybe a sequel will be coming even though most sequels are terrible.  The movie had too much money making stuff in it and not enough Tim Burton.If you want to see this movie I would suggest waiting until the video comes out because I felt like I was always one step ahead of the movie, including the ending.  It was not worth $8!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

After one day of trying to figure it out, I realized that this new version of POTA is great!  A lot of the people who say it 'sucked', obviously weren't paying attention.  Complaints about the super-strength of the apes, and the exaggerated leaps are wrong.  The apes were GENETICALLY ENHANCED, that's why they EVOLVED and turned into the talking apes that they are.  How else would the apes have revolted against the Oberon crew, unless they had that strength? The ending, although extremely confusing, is good for two reasons: would you REALLY want a cliché ending where Wahlberg goes back to Earth and lives happily ever after, and it causes discussion and deep thought even long after the movie is over; something that is rare in movies today. Roth's performance steals the show, while Wahlberg does an OK job (not like you'd expect him to be spectacular anyways).","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Then I read the early reviews coming out of the States and almost didn't go to see it because of the criticism, but I decided to go to make up my own mind.I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised, it was nowhere near as bad as I was expecting. There are a few things that let the plot down and stretch credibility, but then you have to expect that with science fiction movies. Why would they be using monkeys to pilot probes, when even now they have automated ones? Why does the Chimp's pod turn up at that exact minute when it has been missing for thousands of years?? You just have to suspend your dis-belief and go along with the story. If you can do that then you will probably enjoy it. Let's face it, the original doesn't stand up to any degree of scientific analysis either, so why analyse this one?There has been a lot of talk about the endding, to me it made perfect sense, I don't see what all the whining is about. It is obvious that he has gone foward into the future of the same planet, he never went back to Earth. Thade has obviously made a comeback and has lead the apes in a reconquest of the planet, and they have now developed technology (perhaps with the help of the data banks on the ship, now that they know they are there). Simple as that. Why are people getting confused and thinking he went back to earth?? That really would make no sense at all!The only strange thing about the ending, is why oh why didn't he stay with Estella Warren! She wanted him, and he left!! Now that really does stretch credibility!Another interesting thing is that there appear to be several species of apes (Gorillas, Chimps and Orang-Utangs as far as I can tell), and yet they all get along fine and live under the banner 'Ape'. Surely to a Chimp a Gorilla would be as alien as a human! After all humans are a species of ape as well! It seems that this movie is displaying the old human arrogance that there are humans in one catagory, and the whole animal kingdom in the other and that we are the superior. I think it far more likely that each species would hate all the others, just as we see in nature. But that would make the movie far to complicated!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I'm not going to go on about the make-up or the behaviour of the apes in this film or the visual style - all these sorts of things, as with the aforementioned movies, are highly comendable.  What concerns me is the lack of narrative, character, or emotion these films have.  While it is worthwhile to exploit new technologies and groundbreaking visuals, film is (or at least should be) a visual way TO TELL A STORY.  Let me repeat that.  TO TELL A STORY. Imagine reading the ""Book of the movie"" after seeing this film, and see if the story, without all the wham-bang action and spectacular scenery, has any effect.James Cameron spent enourmous effort researching the visual style of the early last century, and both the rise and fall of the Titanic.  Although the story he included was cheesey, high-flying campy romantic fluff, somehow it worked and made (some) sense, and was intertwined with the visuals.  In Apes, all we see are the visuals.  It could have been a silent film for all the dialogue was worth.More specifically, could someone please tell me what the extra human characters were there for - I mean aside from sex appeal (Chanel-5 girl), political correctness (black guy) and who knows what (spoiled brat kid with no name)?And maybe someone who thinks that ending was brilliant could tell me why? Surprise endings only work if they make sense.  Marky could have landed in the Saraha desert and been arrested by camel-riding Santa Clauses and it would have about as much sense.As far as I'm concerned, the original movies (yes, all of them) had focus, good, well defined characters, and more plausabile, interesting, science-fiction content.  And really, the make-up of the new one is better, but is it really leaps and bounds (no pun intended) forward of the job they did in 1968?  I think not.  For those who will contend that the original series' sequals were nothing more than commercially driven,  money-makers capatalizing on the success of the original - well, here we go again, eh?Despite being an avid Tim Burton and Apes fan, I can easily say this is the worst Burton film, and the worst Apes film.As far as the screenwriters are concerned, I only have this to say: ""Damn you!  Damn you all to hell!""","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Some of mark's (leo davidson) lines were very poorly delivered. In my opinion, marky shouldn't have joined the Funky Bunch, and he should have gone to acting school (or a better one if he already has). Besides him, everyone one's acting was pretty good, but some of Duncan's deliveries were also poor.Yes, I liked this movie, but I did like the original better. It seemed that everything that was wrong with the original, was good in this one, what was bad in the new one, was good in the old one. Was Burton trying to make it better, and just missed the things that were good, concentrating only on the bad parts?Yes, the ending was bad. When Marky (leo) landed on earth (it wasn't the same planet, the solar system is our own, and it is earth when they show the large picture). He lands on the steps, and sees that the memorial now has Thade's head on it. The cops pull up, apes jump out, in full cop clothing, they pull guns on Leo. About this time I put my head in my hands, and just lost it. I laughed for a couple minutes, because of how rediculous it was. Hoping, that there was more, but no. Sure to be more if and when there is a sequal. Will it be a reimagining of the second original (lets hope not)?Yes, many people have tried to explain the ending.

The original idea of the movie was not to re-make the classic film, but to ""re-imagine"" it. At first, this seemed like a brilliant idea. Who better to direct a new version of Planet of the Apes than the odd yet brilliant Tim Burton?Well, great ideas often do not lead to great finished products.And that is what this film really is. It is not a great movie. It is an average, sometimes funny(especially Paul Giamatti), sometimes thrilling(battle sequences are amazing) film. But as a whole? Average.
The problems with the movie all come from the fact that Burton did not know exactly how he wanted to re-imagine the movie. Should it be a serious, sci-fi version? The last 20 minutes seem to point in this direction. Should it be a ""spoofesque"" movie that doesn't take itself too seriously? The entire middle section of this movie seems to point in this direction.In the end, this film is confused and awkward. Tim Burton wants you to like this movie, it's clear the entire time. Unfortunately, the acting is strained and the movie too muddled to ever develop into a classic.I am suggesting that this movie is worth renting or going to the theater, but it's not worth owning(unless you are a huge Burton fan). This movie is better than Mars Attacks and Sleepy Hollow, but it does not even approach Batman or Edward Scissorhands.I give this movie ** out of **** stars.

The attention to scenery and detailed makeup and costumes were wonderfully crafted and grabbed the viewer's attention from the beginning.  So now you've gotten used to the ape planet, what's next? The story and characters.  That's what this film seemed to lack.
The original Planet of the Apes had the advantage of a brand new idea (to anyone who hadn't read the book) to enthrall the audience.  The story was new and the characters had feelings and interactions that fit well with the effects.The 2001 version, unfortunately, had Mark Wahlberg playing an unfeeling robot of a character.  From the moment he lands on this mind-blowing planet, he never deviated from his primary motivation.  Granted, this is a necessary element for all scripts, but usually the motivation is complimented with other story elements and characters along the way.Wahlberg's character never takes notice of any other character or for that matter, any event that is taking place around him.  This becomes frustrating for the viewer as a story is desperately trying to reveal itself but is constantly stunted by the main character.As for the ending, well, it's a thinker.

If not for Ari's (Helen Bonham Carter) ""too human"" make-up, it wouldn't take you too long to forget that they were actors only made up to look like apes.  Tim Roth WAS Thade! Both Tim Roth as General Thade and Paul Giamatti as Limbo deserve a nod come Oscar time. Unfortunately the majority of the cast looked as though they were phoning it in.In a couple of scenes you could see that Estella Warren was wearing heavy lip gloss but this could be a cinematography problem as in another scene it appeared as Mark Wahlberg was also wearing lip gloss.As for the story, it is one that a non sci-fi fan would assume was ""good"" science fiction, however it wasn't.  The plot had holes the size of Texas and there was no sign that anyone had tried to fill them.  The original movie ended with a ""Gosh WOW!"" and this one ended with a ""what the f..., HUH?""  I can still remember coming out of the theatre after seeing the orginal for the first time with a sense of wonder.  Of course that was back in a time when the thought of the human race nuking itself to oblivion wasn't that big a stretch.  I was thinking about the ending of that film for weeks, I doubt I'll be thinking about the ending of this one tomorrow.  One good thing to say about the ending is that it more closely echos the ending the book ""Monkey Planet"" by Pierre Boulle than the original film did.Having said all these nasty things, there is still much to enjoy about this film.  The direction was very good and the score was delightful.

When Burton gives us a movie we can be sure not to get another Hollywood show of their big special effects. Instead we get a movie where the superb effects are just minor details that support the story´s substance.Burton´s ""remake"" of 'Planet of the Apes' is as surprising as the first because the story is different. Yet the themes are the same: racism and equality being the most important. Another theme in the movie is the complexity of time travel that Burton deals with in the same way as e.g. ex-Python Terry Gilliam did in '12 Monkeys'.The apes are outstanding e.g. because of their walk and their interactions in general. Another thing I truly love about this movie is that the music score has been kept in the same stile as the score in the original Planet of the Apes.All in all an exceptional movie that is a must.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

All part of an education in a time, the '70s, where men could be reflected in evolved apes, their penchant for cruelty and misunderstanding, horror and revolt, subjugation, was still poignant. In Tim Burton's film, there's no deeper meaning to the situation, not many today under the age of thirty and living in America have any true idea of the danger of being human, of being the superior creature on the planet, whose drive for self-destruction might just give birth to a new world order, run by man's genetic ancestor, the ape.Tim Burton doesn't concern himself with reflecting the human race. He just sets out, along with Tim Roth and Helena Carter, to show just how awesome an intelligent, weapons-using, armored gorilla is. Also, there's an entire Ape psychology to go along with the advancements, the 'human' qualities. Apes explode in frenzies of blurred animal movment when startled, they smell at one another to perceive lies or fear, they use touch as a constant reminder of their closeness, just as they did when they didn't use tongues or swords as weapons.So for your money, you get a bunch of stiff, annoying 'humans', all of whom speak perfect English (a plotless point, since in the original film humans were animals, speechless--here, despite being subjugated for thousands of years, humans talk but don't say anything at all, no different than they do today, when the fact is these humans living as squalid jungle rats  should have devolved over time to about idiot level, about the same as your average high schooler, say) and its obvious that Burton could give a hoot about any of the human characters outside the hero Davison, an astronaut who falls from the sky and becomes a messiah. All the rest of the humans squeak protest and get crushed by Apes. And good riddance, because it's the Apes that the movie is about. How cool is it to be able to jump twelve feet in the air, use your feet as hands, and be stronger than three or four big strong men, with the fighting ferocity of a primal beast? That's why Burton made this flick.Tim Roth also gives probably his best performance, as zealous military commander Thade trying to hide the truth of the Ape Planet's origin. Helena Carter's Ari simply is the sexiest woman with facial hair and chimp hands you will ever see. And there is the fantastic ending.For me, the ending 'shock' works like I wouldn't have thought it would. Fact is, the story behind the ending, the implications, the actual love and appreciation shown for Rod Serling's 1968 script, is what makes it work. And sequels can be made, just like in the 70s, because it is the APES' story, just like it always was. If I'd seen this movie when I was a kid, I'd be loping on all fours like a charging gorilla or jumping out of trees and off furniture for weeks, all while emulating Thade's savage up-from-under glare. What Burton does is make me remember how great I thought Cornelius and Dr. Zeus was when I was an ankle-biter. Apes ruled then, and they rule now.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Disappointed, insulted and fed up","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511991/?ref_=tt_urv","fha-2","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0916806/?ref_=tt_urv","31 July 2001","What more can be said about the new Planet of the Apes (POTA)?  Truly, this so-called summer blockbuster insults moviegoers with its trite storyline, excessive and inappropriate violence, monochromatic acting, inaccurate, contradictory and illogical sequences, implausibility, lackluster performances, and poor direction.  To call this a remake of the original 1968 version is tantamount to pouring ketchup on a gourmet meal.  The makers of the original POTA and the author of the original book must be gnashing their teeth in absolute outrage.  What is wrong with this puppy?  Let me present a few examples:· In the beginning sequences, what four-star general would ever tolerate such insubordinate language from a mere captain?  Or for that matter, what general would speak so contemptuously to his star crewmember?· What rational human being and ostensibly highly trained military officer would flagrantly disobey his general and subject himself to such an absurd physical risk to reclaim his monkey?· If the apes used the humans as a valuable resource such as servants, why would they treat them so abusively defies all reason.  To use humans to pull the cages of other humans is a waste of valuable resources, when they could have just as easily used horses that would have accomplished the task far more efficiently.· The original POTA had various elements of their society that were sensitive and intelligent.  Why make them all appear to be such a raving band of lunatics, particularly their leader?· Does this Mark Wahlberg have any emotion at all?  Clearly, he could have emailed his performance in rather than waste our time and money to watch him go through his ridiculous antics.· When in the initial scenes the humans are escaping from their cages, does it make sense for them to dash through bedroom after bedroom rather than simply flee the premises?  Clearly, the scenes are a poorly contrived vehicle to bring some humor into this dismal display of MTV chaos that no doubt stimulates the average junior high school student to gape in wonder and awe.· Why in the world would the leader of this unruly zoo seek to destroy all the humans?  There are no electronical or other mechanical assets to assist them in their daily living.  It seems they would simply be destroying their own major assets.· If the original ancestors of the apes were these chimpanzees contained in the spaceship's cages, where did the gorillas and the orangutans come from?· If as Mark Wahlberg states in the spaceship that the nuclear power of the ship lasts for thousands of years, why is it that it is only good for one thrust to knock out the ape's attack?  If that was indeed a blast from the ship's engines, it would surely have fried all the chimps to a crisp, not merely knock them out so they could regain consciousness all at once to resume the attack.· This story has been used so many times and in so many forms that it defies all descriptions of triteness and predictability.  I cannot imagine any writer worth his salt turning out such dribble unless severely brain-damaged, high on drugs or alcohol, or simply senile.  I further question the inaction of the director Tim Burton when presented with such nonsense.  Does he believe all audiences are retarded?  Perhaps so.
In any event, I've spent far too much of my valuable time with this poor excuse for entertainment.  If Hollywood continues to turn out such poor excuses for amusement, we are doomed as the world leader in the entertainment industry","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You know the one. Two DVD's worth which seems to incorporate every thing including the colour of the kitchen sink they used. Isn't it scary that this shows that they seemed to have taken everything into account except the script?I followed this reworking' up the point where the Space introduction ended and we ended up on The Planet of the Apes' and it was about here I realised how poor the film was.As a basic example; in the original, at least it had the sense to say that the reason society had evolved  the way it had was because the humans were at the Stone Age level where they hadn't even developed the capacity of speech. As a result the apes had evolved faster than them and were able to dominate them. This reworking didn't even bother to do that. I don't think I'm being too pedantic by saying, if the humans could speak why were they still wandering around like caveman? It seems such a fundamental flaw to the plot, I felt it rather insulting to my intelligence.Then again, so many things seem to suggest that the script was written by a bunch of precocious High School students. As someone else has pointed out in these reviews; it's full of quotes from the original  - including the famous `Damn them all to Hell!'  which have absolutely no relevance to the current movie. You can almost see the writers of this thing sniggering behind their hands saying `I know, wouldn't it be cool if we put this line in!'
The DVD shows they spent months on getting the make-up right, the movements of the apes right, etc. etcwe even had a very boring documentary about how much effort Danny Elfman put into writing this score, but who was looking at the story? Were the people behind this movie too frightened to say to Tim Burton because he's such a `visionary genius' that the film didn't make any sense?I dunno, what does it matter? This film was a commercial success so it must be good. The only small mercy I can think of is that that, once upon a time, Tim Burton seemed the obvious choice to visualise `Lord of the Rings'. After seeing this movie, thank goodness he didn't.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Anyone who was disappointed by this film did not use common sense.  Do you really think a movie this big, with this kind of budget, this kind of A-list director and this kind of cast was really going to satisfy you when it comes to plot and character development?  There has not been a hollywood movie out in years that has satisfied my intellectual yearnings, I have stopped seeking this kind of satisfaction in a hollywood film because it is Sisyphean.  This film did exactly what I expected it to do, it kept my attention for a full two hours.  Anybody who wanted to have the social commentary of the first movie, the melo-dramatic over-acting of the first movie, the garish orange costumes and the justified willful suspension of disbelief that the first film supplied you with you should have rented the first movie and stayed home.Anyone who enjoys Tim Burton's beautiful productions and just wants to sit in an air conditioned theatre for two hours without expectations should see this film, maybe even twice if your father missed it when you went with your girlfriend the first time.

OK, so the costumes were well-done.  And Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth do adequate jobs representing the oversilly, stereotyped liberal ape-fascist ape dualism. But this rushed, ridiculously overviolent mess looks like it was churned out in about one month a/la last year's sci-fi classics ""Mission to Mars"" and ""Red Planet.""  And, here's my question to the makers of this flick:  Why is every ""ape"" in Planet of the Apes 2001 stereotyped in the most offensive colonial worldview way?  Examples:  The violent, military apes are all like African ""savages.""  The sly, merchant ape is like a Jewish Shylock from Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice.  The wise, senator ape is like a royal European Anglo (above the dominant military savage apes).  The metaphysical/religious apes in the street are like turn-of-the-century W.D. Griffith stereotyped morphine-smoking Chinese-Americans with fu-manchu beards and long straight hair.  And, in an annoying modern twist, the adolescent apes are like miniature Fred Dursts, backwards hats and all anti-""adult"" attitude.  Oh, and let's not forget the human stereotypes: Mark ""I always play the same part"" Wahlberg as macho space ""captain,"" Estella Warren as the full-lipped Barbie Doll sex object, and faceless adolescent boy playing the ""I want to prove I am a man by fighting in a war"" part so steretypically.  Hey, if this is the way the book was written, fine.  But you know what?  I don't think anyone should consider this type of overly simplistic stereotyped character manipulation as ""entertainment"" anymore. Hollywood, William Broyles Jr., and Tim Burton:  Have you no clue that these stereotypes are an ugly waste of everyone's time?  But, I know, this is just ""entertainment.""  As long as it's ""entertainment"", that's OK.  What else? This movie has absolutely no plot or character development whatsoever.  It is like a series of quick scene ideas spliced together very haphazardly. There is little chance to get to know or empathize with anyone in the film. Most of the human characters are so character-less that their actions seem unbelievable.  And what of the setting?  Very, very strange.  Yes, it's got that dark, Burton touch, but it almost doesn't make sense in this film. There's something too small, almost stagelike about the setting of this film that goes against the expansiveness of its theme.  This is supposed to be about someone traveling millions of miles from earth and it feels like they've gone about twenty feet.  And there's no real sense of an ""ape world"" on this planet; it's like they all live in a little box (and there's only like one hundred of them there).  And what was with that scene when the humans were escaping and they kept running through all of the apes' houses? It was like something out of The Three Stooges or Abbot and Costello. Finally, in relationship to this last ""funny"" scene, there's the inconsistency in the approach to this film.  Is it supposed to be campy or is it supposed to be serious?  It just doesn't know.  You could have heard a pin drop in the theater (which was quite full) when I saw this and the apes muttered ""funny"" lines such as, ""Get your damn dirty hands off me you stinking human"" and ""Can't we all just get along?""  Uh, what?  I'm sorry, Tim Roth, but I simply don't get this film.  I think it stinks in every way possible.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Good Housekeeping Seal for brainless summer fare","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512035/?ref_=tt_urv","Swift-12","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0606825/?ref_=tt_urv","1 August 2001","Short on substance and long on flashy peripheralia (ie, costumes, art direction, FX) -- which is my typical lament of the past ten years of film history. Mind you, it's NOT A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME, but Marky Mark, er Mark Wahlberg, can't carry the film. Estella Warren needs a few more pounds of collagen in her lips, and Kris Kristofferson's role was a throwaway. On the plus side, the humorous Paul Giamatti got a lotta laughs, and Tim Roth was thoroughly despicable and frightening.Some of Marky's weakness is due to the script changes... the humans can talk. Ok, so then what makes Wahlberg so special to the apes? They don't even comment on his spacesuit. Talking humans is a serious stray from the crux of the Swiftian novel by Pierre Boulle, with its Gulliver's Travels -like reversal of species. Meanwhile the second half of the flick degenerates into a long chase and so-called-epic-sized battle, neither handled well. While the film surpasses the original in costumes and FX, it owes everything to its 1968 precedent. ie, the introduction and exposition of the apes moves much quicker because of our familiarity of the original.
The apes themselves are superior to the original in make-up and movement and cultural detail. The ape city is more impressive. But while the specifics of the FX are more impressive than the first, they are nevertheless over-the-top. Even the Foley artists-- every step, every wrinkle of fabric, every thump of the chest is horribly amplified (maybe it was just the damn multiplex whose volume levels were through the roof). In regards to the FX-ridden films of recent years, I was reminded of Laurence Olivier's remark about make-up (which doesn't apply to this film's make-up; it does apply to FX and film-making in general): exagerrate only one detail of a character (the long nose of Richard III, for ex.), otherwise the whole face becomes a meaningless mass of putty -- the performance becomes marred, not enhanced. The same rule applies to FX. Director Burton and most of our FX-crazy film-makers would do well to quit poring over every little technical doo-dad and spend more time on dialogue and plot.Oh, and I can't stand physics-defying FX ... apes that leap 20 feet in the air... apes that aren't vaporized by a horrendous rocket blast but are merely stunned for a few seconds... apes that punch a man so hard he flies 15 feet off the ground (when such a force would decapitate him)... men who survive being knocked 15 feet off the ground and arise to get knocked 15 feet off the ground a second, third, and fourth time (this isn't the mark of the character's heroism; it's the mark of a director's sadism. If he's not sadistic, then he's immaturely fixated on the visuals of slinging a body through space.) The opening segment provides a more plausible explanation, if you demand some kind of logical time-anomaly reason which the first version lacked. But then the time paradox in the closing really falls flat. It seems tacked on for the sake of an obligatory Time-Paradox twist.  And for the obligatory sequel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","I am wowed again and again by such a reverent remake.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511922/?ref_=tt_urv","beckerbuns","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0775770/?ref_=tt_urv","28 July 2001","Tim Burton never ceases to amaze me.He had me from ""Pee-Wee's Big Adventure"", kept me in awe through ""Beetlejuice"", ""Batman"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", and ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" and has not slown down since.Burton has a way of turning an ordinary story, perhaps even one you've seen before, into a work of art.  He turned the campy original series ""Batman"" into a dark, seething masterpiece of a film.  He transformed his own ""Nightmare"" into a moral tale that kids and adults could both appreciate.And now he has remade ""Planet of the Apes"" with reverence and technical prowess.From the get-go, this film has you hooked with its brooding atmosphere and careful storytelling.  The plot is carefully laid out from the beginning, and even though you might begin to think you know what's going to happen, you are constantly surprised.I found my jaw hanging open throughout the whole sequence where the hero (played by Mark Wahlberg) crash lands on the planet.  The effect was so well done it was hard to imagine it being anything but totally real.In classic fashion, the heroic characters are super-good, though not without their flaws, and the villainous characters are supremely evil.  The roles are reversed in this film, with the apes being the masters and the humans being the ones who are caged and kept as pets.  By the way, monkeys don't make very nice masters.  Which reminds me, the addition of a young monkey girl keeping a small blonde-haired waif as a pet was a classic Burton touch.I don't feel like I can talk too much about the plot without giving it all away.  From the first moment of the film to the surprise ending, it's a non-stop roller coaster ride of a movie, and might possibly now be one of my top five films of all time.  It's a masterful work of art.  Tim Burton surely has his place in history now as one of the greatest directors of all time.I have not read any reviews of ""Planet of the Apes"" before writing this review, as I did not want them to taint my feelings about the film.  Even if the critics pan this movie, though, there is no way my feelings will change. I am in awe.Finally, I cannot end this review without a nod to Danny Elfman, my favorite singer/songwriter/composer of all time and a frequent Tim Burton collaborator.  Elfman's music in this film is quite different than his usual style, but at the same time fits right in with the theme and darkness of it. The beginning of the film is like ""Batman"", with a close-up shot through the credits while the music builds up an-almost frightening momentum until the movie actually begins.See it.  You won't regret it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Great retelling of a classic story","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0511729/?ref_=tt_urv","mushrom","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0705193/?ref_=tt_urv","27 July 2001","When Pierre Boulle wrote the original book ""The Monkey Planet"", he was mostly known for the classic story ""Bridge Over The River Kwai"".When it was made into a movie in 1968, Charlton Heston ingrained this movie permanently in our minds.  He was also a driving force in the creation of the original, having read the original book and helping to bring it to the attention of the money men in Hollywood and carrying it from original concept to final completion.In fact, the original movie is such a classic, it spawned 4 sequals and 2 TV series (1 live action and one animated).  It's influence was so wide, that when ""Welcome Back Kotter"" premiered on TV, the character Arnold Horshack carried a POTA lunchbox wherever he went.This new version in many ways is both closer to the original book, and also deviates much more.The effects and makeup in this version are spectacular.  Much as the original revolutionized makeup for decades to come, this one will also show it's influence for a long time.  Rather then use computer graphics to create the apes, the use of makeup and appliances is spectacular.Tim Burton did a fantastic job on this movie.  And of course, what is a Tim Burton movie without Danny Elfman doing the musical score.  Combined, they have made a movie that is sure to be a classic for years to come.One of the biggest differences is that the classes of ape are not as seperated as they were in the original.In the original, Chimps all wore green and were scientists.  Gorillas wore black and were military, and Orangutangs wore orange and were clergy/politicians.  In this they are more diverse, and there even seems to be hints of cross-species breeding.  This makes for a much more diverse history, and more potential for both conflict and support.Also, the humans in this version are able to talk, but they strive to hide that fact from the apes.  And as the humans are more human then in the original, the apes are more ape like.  They frequently jump around and climb on things, write with their feet, touch and groom each other, and in general are more like evolved apes should be.The cast is excellent, with both Michael Clarke Duncan and Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa playing excellent roles.  Michael Clarke Duncan is one of the best new actors in the business today, and this role is as far as possible from The Green Mile.Tim Burton added several subtle and not so subtle pokes and images from both the original and contemporary society into the movie.  From Charlton uttering his classic ""Damn them all to hell"" again, to an Orangutang saying the Rodney King line ""Can't we all just get along"", to having another orangutang rub himself with flower petals while upside down, very reminiscant to ""American Beauty"".Of course, the most memorable part of the original movie is the ending. The image of Charlton Heston looking at the wreckage of the Statue Of Liberty is forever burned into our minds.  In much the same way, this ending will also be burned into our minds.  And in many ways, the ending this time is much closer to the original ending as written by Pierre Boulle.I am curious to how they will do a sequal to this movie.  In today's market, everything from American Pie to Wayne's World have sequals.  And this is really the first time that a movie spawned a series of sequals (the 007 movies do not count, since they do not sequal in any order, and were based on a series of books).  So it will be interesting to see if this movie spawns a similar series of sequals.If you loved the original movie, you have to see this one.In addition to Charlton Heston, look for a cameo by Linda Harrison, the actress that played Nova in the original movies.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

He could direct a remake of Ernest Saves Christmas starring Pauly Shore as Ernest, and I'd probably like it. Well, maybe not with Pauly Shore.Having said that, let me just say that I loved Planet of the Apes, but here's the catch...DO NOT go into it thinking about the original. Forget everything you know about Planet of the Apes starring Charlton Heston, and think of this as a brand new concept, and I'm pretty sure you will love this movie as much as I did.I mean, think about it. Burton directed ""Sleepy Hollow"" which really didn't follow the original story, but can you honestly tell me that ""Sleepy Hollow"" was a bad movie?The original ""Planet"" is a classic. I am so glad that Burton didn't do a shot for shot remake of it, like that horrible ""Psycho"" remake a few years ago.By the way, the Heston cameo will go down in history as one of the finest cameos ever. Ranking right up there with his cameo in ""Wayne's World 2"".Like I said in the summary, this ""Planet"" is not the original, and thank goodness for that. It's a brand new movie with brand new apes, and brand new humans. Burton you continue to amaze me!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Apes v's Humans-""Rule the Acting""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512522/?ref_=tt_urv","OzzyWan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1223723/?ref_=tt_urv","29 August 2001","The original Planet of the Apes was an epic of sorts, the remake, or re-imagining' as director Tim Burton prefers to refer to his film as, is slightly different, it strives for a more simple action film, which is not necessarily a bad thing as it proves to be a, linear, but nonetheless entertaining hour and half or so of film.The standard of acting varies considerably, on the whole the ape characters are acted superbly, most notably Tim Roth as the evil General Thade. Helena Bonham Carter is also good in her role as human rights activist Ari. The greatly underrated Paul Giamatti provides a little comic relief as Limbo and Michael Clarke Duncan, who played the giant John Coffey in `The Green Mile', is well suited in his role of Colonel Attar, a giant silver back gorilla. Sadly the human characters are far from as interesting, not to say that the acting on a whole is bad, just a little wooden at times. However Mark Wahlberg is a worthy successor to Charlton Heston (who has a little cameo as Thade's father). Sadly the weakest part of the film is Estella Warren, who plays Daena, it is quite clear that she is in this film for one reason only, and that's not her acting ability.The ape make-up, done by Rick Baker, of `Star Wars' fame is absolutely amazing. Several different species of ape are recreated with exceptional realism, and when compared to the original it is clear how far special effects make-up has come.The ending is a bit predictable, a little ill conceived and on the whole a rather confusing affair, you really need to see it to understand why, it is clear that Burton was aiming for a twist worthy of the original, this is where he falls short as his ending is a little messy, although it does leave it open for a possible sequel, so watch this space.On a closing note, it is quite sad to see that the twisted genius that is Tim Burton, the man who brought us Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and Sleepy Hollow, has apparently been manipulated by Hollywood into making a film for the mass market, hence the 12 certificate, to increase merchandise possibilities. It still has all the visual expertise of Burton but lacks the darkness associated with most of his films. However `Planet of the Apes' is still a highly enjoyable film, if not as memorable as the original. So I highly recommend it to anyone who likes their films with plenty of action, great special effects, and full of apes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Therefore I was prepared to accept the new movie on its own merits.Even so, I walked out of the theater scratching my head and wondering why they'd bothered doing it at all.Yes, I love Tim Burton.  Yes, the costumes, make-up, and sets are amazing. Yes, it was fun, had some good lines, and featured some marvelous acting on the part of Helena Bonham Carter, who was remarkably believable in her chimpanzee-inspired mannerisms and movements.Other than that...so what?Without spoiling too much of either movie, I have to say that the message of the original was far more intelligent.  It really made you stop and think: who's right, who's wrong, do we have any right to judge the apes or should we learn lessons about our own failings in theirs?  This one was merely simplistic summer-movie fare, with a predictable plotline I was correctly forecasting as little as five minutes into the movie.(Yes, and I easily guessed the ""surprise twist ending"" everyone is raving about.  Yawn.  You want a REAL surprise twist ending, go watch ""Sixth Sense"" or ""Unbreakable."")Last but not least, I find it interesting that Heston's character was likeable precisely because he WAS such a crusty cynical old b*****d. Wahlberg's ""brash hotshot pilot"" persona conforms to almost every ""hero"" stereotype in the book...and, thus, is entirely bland and uninteresting, though I do not knock him as an actor.  I DO give the writer(s) full credit for not going the obvious route with the annoyingly ""perfect leggy blonde"" potential love interest, but other than that...well, not much I can say.In short: rent the original and pretend you don't know the ending.  You'll get your money's worth.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The pointed social commentary of the original film, released at the height of the civil rights movement and the Vietnam War is not quite as effective here.Sure, there's also a couple of plot twists that rival the final revelation of the original.  A couple of classic lines from the original are cleverly worked in, and Charlton Heston, who carried the first picture and made us believe in the story, this time plays an ape.

However, a word of caution  they are two very different movies.  The original, with its world-weary Heston, moralising anti-nuke plot and the gee-shucks-can't-we-all-just-get-along narrative, plays out like one of the better episodes of Star Trek.  Tim Burton's take on the simian planet is a million miles away (literally) from the Franklin J. Schaffner version, and so we have the action and the hokey chimptalk, but none of the social relevance.  This, quite frankly, damns the film, damns it all to hell and makes it yet another summer blockbuster of running about and shooting at nasty things.However, considered out of the context of the whole Apes saga, this is a damn fine no-brainer popcorn-flick with plenty of action, plot twists, rugged heroes and monkey madness.  Helena Bonham Carter makes a decent chimp, Tim Roth makes a decent psycho-baddie and Mark Wahlberg makes a decent, well, underwear model.  There is enough to keep your average film junkie happy and the movie does not outstay its welcome.
Hollow, but entertaining nonetheless, Planet of the Apes (2001) is not a bad film and is only disappointing when compared with a) the original b) Tim Burton's back catalogue.  It's also a damn sight better than the four sequels and the TV spin-offs.  Come to think of it, The Simpson's Planet of the Apes Musical may not be such a bad idea after all...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Every frame is packed with so much detail and so much action you won't want to blink. What Burton paints with images, Danny Elfman matches with sound, with yet another excellent score. But it's clear from the get-go that the real stars here are the apes who look and move so wonderfully realistically, you'll forget that they're not. The makeup is so good in The Planet of The Apes, it's hard to see the actor behind the mask. But this seems more an asset than a liability for the ape actors who all put in very strong performances. Unfortunately the 'human' actors are another story: Mark Wahlberg is clearly out of his league and depth here and really struggles to carry the lead. There's a scene where Wahlberg tries to rally the troops and he was so bad, it's funny. Estella Warren looks great but does very little in a role that is really not much more than window dressing.As with many visually stunning films, more care and attention was paid to the look of The Planet of The Apes than the script, so we're asked to make some pretty big leaps of faith. The Planet of The Apes it's definitely NOT a movie to think a lot about when you leave the theater, as many plot points don't hold up well on re-examination. That said, I recommend The Planet of The Apes; it's a very enjoyable movie with a look you won't soon forget!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Thirty years ago, the plot of apes taking over the earth was shocking and very creative in its concept. Now, over the years, we've seen just about every kind of creature appear on the earth. The main character here didn't have the eloquence of Charlton Heston. The end of the film was confusing since he returns back in time to earth, but finds that it was being run by apes. Also, the script deviated from the original one. Aside from the rather slow, confusing plot, the make-up for the apes was outstanding. The scenery was bare, twisted, dark and sinister. The actors who played the apes walked bent or ran on all fours. I think it was good for the action scenes which were not overly violent or bloody. It would be a good family film for children over 10 years of age.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I don't think this is as good as Burton's other work. Edward Scissorhands has been his best so far- I think because it was his concept, it was so bizarre and yet he made a boy with Scissorhands the most emotionally engaging story I have ever seen. As the critics said ""beauty told in simplicity"".Planet of the Apes (POTA) is very distinctive from the opening credits as a Burton film. There are elements of 2001: A Space Odyssey and other little movie references to be found throughout the film. Wahlberg is ideal as the Taylor/Leo character. As an actor he can't go as far as some others but the role is suitable for him. The supporting cast are excellent as apes/chimps/gorillas- the whole bag of bananas. While some will see their antics and comments as corny or cliche, keep in mind this is Burton's own vision (reimagining- that itself is now a cliche!) of Boulle's original novel ""Monkey Planet"".The social comments are very clever and will have you chuckling at certain points. Look out for a classic moment where Burton's partner Lisa Marie performs an exotic ape dance for her man, err ape, err orangutang. The make up is amazing and the set design of Ape City is very stylish. The only quarm I have with it, is it comes across as more like ""Ape Housing Commission"" because it seems so small or claustrophobic.The story is strong, but missing certain power in some parts- however where one element weakens, Burton knows how to fill the screen with something else to take your attention away. I have no doubt in saying Rick's makeup will score him a 2002 Oscar at the Mann Chinese Theatre, not to mention a few others possibly for other areas....And the ending. Oh, the ending. Many will not like the ending, but many will be very intrigued. I thought the ending was unreal- totally Burton!I definately reccomend you go see this film. It is one of the better films of the year. It is not Burton's best, and in a way he has slipped. But we are talking about Burton here, so rest assured he will quickly pick himself back up and create something BRILLIANT again!

PLOT POINTS REVEALED! Hmm, Tim Burton tries his hand at a remake - sorry, ""re-imagining"" - of the 1968 ""classic"". Inevitably, comparisons to the original abound, however, not having seen the original thankfully precludes me from such comparisons (though, yes, we all know it was the Earth. damn them).Burton's film is helped firstly by his imagination. The ape abodes and milieu are beautifully and naturally presented. The considerable advances in makeup technology allow more depth of character to be achieved when it comes to the citizens of the ape community, and the sheer variety of simian forms and facial expressions is itself impressive. The only quibble I would highlight is the ""muffling"" of the actor's voices and the obvious difficulty which they had speaking through the stuff, however this was not too distracting. Wahlberg meanwhile is a sound action hero, but provides little sympathy or interest for the viewer. Bonham Carter is well drawn as the radical humanist ape, but the ""semi-romance"" between her and Wahlberg seems half-hearted and therefore uninteresting. A rivalry between her and the ridiculously-costumed human love interest is just a waste of time, and the girl really serves no other purpose but eye candy and therefore becomes annoyingly superfluous to proceedings. Roth, however, is superb as General Thade, chewing scenery like nobody's business and delightfully hamming his way through revenge dialogue and lots of shouting and leaping about. His body movements too are by far the most excellently observed.Clearly Burton does not wish us to take the film too seriously, given the comic touches which he has added, which include a slightly farcical (and very predictable) lampoon of the Lincoln memorial. The ending, however, does indeed seem tacked-on - useful for interchangeability (he apparently filmed 4 different ones) but not so good for continuity. Considering Burton had a choice of endings, it would appear that he chose the least original, however, it is refreshingly surprising to find that the ending is not as upbeat as may have been expected from the more sentimental proceedings of the rest of the film. All round this is still a good watch, but you can't help thinking that there was far more potential in the material. Burton avoids re-hashing the political stance of the original, however the result is visually stunning and well imagined but with little beneath the surface. Roth steals the show and provides most of the interest throughout the film, and it's a shame that Wahlberg and Bonham Carter never get much to work with.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I mean Apes...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512177/?ref_=tt_urv","ptwomey","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1137398/?ref_=tt_urv","8 August 2001","It seems to be a trend this particular year that there is alot of movies hitting the big screen that are either loved or hated and sometimes lack a satisfying ending. In this regards ""Planet of the Apes"" 2001 is no different, however once again Tim Burton reminds us how wide the imagination can spread.If your like me and are generally unsatisfied with the tripe peddled to the masses in modern day supermarket cinemas then you'll understand my pleasure when a Tim Burton movie comes out. He does things just that extra bit different to most film makers that sets his films apart and makes them a refreshing experience. The first feeling I had when leaving the cinema was ""I need to see that again"". Partly because of an unusual problem with the ending, and partly because Burton's ""Apes"" was an absolute riot.I want to get the plot issues out of the way first; the film is not different in plot to the original in 1968. He arrives, he is captured, he escapes, and there is conflict about the origins of Apes and then a twist ending. No surprises here. This version of the story holds together really well. That is up until the conflict sequences towards the end. Sometimes I wonder if they change writers in these films but the person who thought hard about the script suddenly stopped thinking about it and the movie seemed to suddenly lower a level or two. I am not saying it was poor, no not at all but not up to the same standard as the rest of the film up until that point. Although one must remember this is a film about Apes, and what Apes they are!These walking talking Apes are absolutely fantastic. Unlike the original they all look very different to each other and they actually act like Apes. If you have ever been to the Zoo and Watched the monkeys play you'll know what I mean. Tim Roth was absolutely outstanding and totally convincing as the evil Ape, I was completely in awe of how convincing his character and monkey suit was. Not only was the make-up outstanding but they also must of studied how Apes behave because they had the personalities and behaviour habits down to a fine art! Watching Them hang from the sealing, leap from tree to tree and go berserk was an absolute riot and I enjoyed every minute of it!The humans and the hero on the other hand are a slightly different story! They are obviously not the focus of the film so there are no strong performances, certainly they do not get much screen time. As for Mark Whalberg as Leo he is probably the first true to life hero. There is absolutely nothing special about his character and in the end he does nothing special either except give hope to the humans on this upside down world. He is not an over the top action hero, he is more of a ""nineties man"" with no special traits except his inability to accept Ape control. But we all would object I believe. This is what I liked about Leo, he was ordinary and even when he was trying to motivate the humans at the end no one fell into the trap of an over the top inspirational speech. he sounded like you or I would making it up on the spot. Tim Burton once again gives us a different spin on an old icon.Finally we come to the very end and probably the main point of confusion for everyone. No matter what your theory is I think we all need the script writers to come forth and ""please explain!"". I did like the ending but originally it did confuse me and there are so many conflicting facts in the story that prevent most logical conclusions that my mind was going to explode. All the same I implore you not to let this be a deterrent as the film in totality is a marvellous experience.I don't want to give this movie a rating because it is again definitely one of those films, which you will either love or hate. These kinds of films generally cause discussions of great length and analysis and no one will ever agree particularly on a theory for the end of this one. However I certainly loved the film and believe it was worth the price of the admission. The best thing to do is go and see it for yourself, making up your own mind is the most satisfying thing about it all.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","I have to say it. Tim Burton's retelling of Planet...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512569/?ref_=tt_urv","Indy-52","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0427990/?ref_=tt_urv","7 September 2001","I have to say it. Tim Burton's retelling of Planet of the Apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys.OK, that's off my chest. No more monkey puns, I promise.Seriously, though, Planet of the Apes is one rip-roarin' summer outing, filled with thrills, action, adventure, wit and bits of funny (dare I say, monkey) business. I know, I know, I promised.And for those film buffs who are fond of the original, Burton's version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie.Mark Wahlberg stars as Capt. Leo Davidson, a deep-space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future. He crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted, captured and sold into slavery.Despite being darker than the original, Burton's film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious.Some of the movie's flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically Burton: An organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed. Then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter. The seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty: ""One thing you don't want in your house is a human teen-ager,"" he says. You don't have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement. Touches such as these are what stamps this movie with Burton's brand.Lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout: The first words spoken by an ape to Davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian's foot to try righting himself are: ""Take your stinking hand off of me, you damned, dirty human."" Anyone familiar with the first version of the film will, of course, recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue.Another of Burton's in-jokes is to have Charlton Heston, star of the original, play the chimpanzee father of Tim Roth's Gen. Thade. The young chimp goes to visit his dying father. Both have one thing in common, a hatred of humans. With his dying breath, the elder spews out his vile: ""Damn them, damn them all to hell,"" he says before expiring. That is the famous line Heston's Taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet's terrible secret.The performances throughout are top-notch. Wahlberg plays Davidson not as some gung-ho hero, but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home. He is reluctant to lead the human rebellion; his only objective being to find a way off this upside-down planet. This hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable.Roth is ferocious, cunning, cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity. He leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet. It is a masterful turn.Helena Bonham Carter is Ari, the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals. Hers is a smart, compassionate characterization.Michael Clarke Duncan is big and brutal as Attar the gorilla aid to Thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken.
A fine comic outing is given by Paul Giamatti as Limbo, the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures. As the battle between apes and humans looms, the cowardly Limbo pleads, ""Can't we all just get along,"" echoing the words of Rodney King.Much of the success of Planet of the Apes goes to Burton's technical crew, especially production designer Rick Heinrichs and the legendary Rick Baker who created the ape makeup.Burton's musical collaborator, Danny Elfman, provides another fine score, though it is not as memorable as his work on Batman or Sleepy Hollow.The movie's only letdown comes at the very end where Burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original. He comes close, but falls short.Otherwise, Planet of the Apes is what a summer movie should be: An amusement park ride filled with lots of action, stunts and a few laughs. This is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre-release hype.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

He has""re-imagined"" the story by removing all of the heavy implicationsand morals of the original, and replacing them with special effectsand corny satire, interspersed with brief, undeveloped fragmentsof theme. Burton is more concerned with the look of the Ape planetand their inhabitants than what they do - and the result is rathershallow. Out the window goes the science-fiction intrigue of theoriginal, in comes a surprise ending... and by ""surprise,"" I, ofcourse, mean ""confusing."" Burton has essentially done nothingmore than dumb down the classic and make it look better. Whichhe certainly does - the settings, costumes, and make-up work is,as always, spectacular. Like ""Batman"" and ""Sleepy Hollow,"" Burtoncan flawlessly create a world more sinister and eerily realistic thanany original could imagine. While the first ""Planet of the Apes""featured humanoid people in cheesy ape-masks walking arounduninteresting terrain, this version has exponentially morebelievable apes that climb trees, build ape cities, walk with aape-like shuffle, leap high in the air, and fight amazinghand-to-hand combat battle. The misty swamps and torch-litforested ape-towns are brilliantly created. The acting is not aproblem, Helena Bonham Carter and Tim Roth are good in theirroles, while Mark Wahlburg is given nothing more to do than flexhis muscles and run around. But, unfortunately, ""Planet of theApes"" has always been about more than just men running awayfrom violent simians. Burton's plot just doesn't cut it - it's hard toignore the holes in the logic and the ending seems mindlesslyrandom. Other distractions - such as a painfully bad three-way lovetriangle between Wahlburg, his female ape savior, and a femalehuman slave - further take away from anything meaningful onemay try to take away from the film. Overall, like most Burton, it looksgood but doesn't quite satisfy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I was expecting the worst (especially since I  had originally heard that Arnie was to star) but I was pleasantly surprised. Remaking such an icon is a big ask at the best of times, and Burton does his best, bringing  his typical dark edge to the film, but he apparently had to battle the studio every inch of the way, and the interference shows in the lack of overall cohesion.That being said, the film has many great aspects. Danny Elfman, as always, excels with his score, and the opening title music is superb (turn it up LOUD!); this is no mean feat since the POTA1 score by the great Jerry Goldsmith is one of THE great film scores.If for no other reason, this film is worth seeing for Tim Roth's bravura performance. He steals the picture as the ape general, Thade, imbuing the character (and the excellent makeup) with a performance of such mailicious psycopathy that he'd have undoubtedly been nominated for an Oscar it he had been playing a character in a gangster film.Mark Wahlberg is a likeable screen presence and getting better, though hardly a 'great' actor, but with talent like Roth and Bonham Carter alongside him, even in the ape makeup they tend to dominate. He's a somewhat stolid performer and as noted elsewhere, he pretty much plays the angry-intense thing most of the time, but that's basically all he has to do here, and the real stars are the apes anyway.Design, makeup and SFX are great, much lusher and more detailed than the rather spartan California look of the original. Some people were obviously very disappointed by the ending, and there's no way even Burton could have topped the original in that respect. There's a lot of humour too, and some very funny references to the original (Chuck Heston's uncredited cameo is great).No, it's not the greatest sci-fi film ever made, and no, it's obviously not even the film Tim Burton wanted to make, but in spite of all the fiddling and the disappointing aspects, it's still a diverting and often entertaining watch. I've certainly seen MUCH worse.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But my chakras were unaligned and I stuck around anyway for the 8:25 show. The plot goes like this. The year is 2029. American astronauts are testing chimpanzees as pilots on a space station. After losing a prized chimp in an electric windstorm, Leo, played by Mark Wahlberg tries to rescue him. The electric windstorm also acts as a time warp and transports Leo into the future onto a planet where Apes are evolutionary superior to humans.What has it been about Tim Burton's recent movies that have just left a bad taste in my mouth? Sleepy Hollow was bearable but certainly not up to par with Burton's earlier work. Call me nostalgic, but I think back to the days of Batman and Beetlejuice and I see genius. I watch Planet of the Apes and I think sellout...I went to this movie with no real expectations. Admittedly, I was suspicious of all the hype this movie was getting but I was interested to see it, soley because Burton directed it. Where do I begin? I was disappointed with the acting. Mark Wahlberg played his lead role of astronaut turned hero with complete stoicism but no human depth. Estella Warren was there purely for eyecandy; if she is capable of acting, she wasn't given the chance. Even Tim Roth and Helena Bonham Carter, well established thespians, were held back with a dry, clicheed script. Of course the special effects and set were amazing...blah, blah, blah. But Burton doesn't usually forego story for effects. His effects from earlier years have been just as impressive even with a smaller budget. The set is supposed to add to the movie and storyline, not surpass it. Speaking of storyline, where was it? This movie didn't have one, or at least an original one. I know you're thinking it was just a remake...how could the story be original? If you're going to bother remaking a film, you should do it for a reason...to show a different viewpoint or take on it; go somewhere the first one could have but didn't. For example, the 1968 original was very philosophical and dealt with religious issues. It was kitsch for the time, but it also made you think. 2001's Apes seems to have bypassed all philisophical debate and just provided a limited plot, excellent makeup and set, set, set.  Thats basically all that this movie has to offer, which in my mind is not worth $9 and two hours of my time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Amazing!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512115/?ref_=tt_urv","Absinth","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0524917/?ref_=tt_urv","3 August 2001","When 'The Haunting' flopped at the box office while the ultra-low budget 'Blair Witch Project' became all the rage, it was a prime example of how the most sophisticated high-tech special effects don't guarantee a good remake of a classic movie (or, for that matter, any other movie). Consequently, I expected much the same when I heard of the 'Planet of the Apes' remake: today's advanced effects, prettier actors perhaps, and essentially expensive rehash. Tim Burton's version of the classic epic is a pleasant surprise. Sure enough, the movie does have dazzling special effects--the most impressive beyond a single doubt Rick Baker's ape makeup. And the actor's are, for the most part, new-millennium pretty (even some of the apes). But the story has also been completely and compellingly re-imagined and re-created. This is a new tale which has little in common with the original movie except that they are both based on Pierre Boulle's book--and that they are both excellent. The attention to (often hilarious) detail in Tim Burton's movie is delightful, and for those who remember the original 'Planet of the Apes' well enough, there are also a few pleasantly twisted nods to the classic to discover. The story moves along at a brisk pace and never fails to involve, making the movie seem shorter than it is, and the plot surprises in intelligent ways during the final part of the action. Another wonderful thing to observe is how well the makeup allows the actors behind it to bring their characters to life. While the masks in the original films were impressive, they allowed for little more than moving mouths and the occasional twitching nose. The masks in the new movie, on the other hand, accommodate a seemingly unlimited range of facial expressions. It takes more imagination to picture that there are human faces behind the makeup than it does to accept the simian characters as genuine. This new 'Planet of the Apes' is indeed not a remake, but an original movie based on the same novel that inspired the first one. A strong story, solid characters, AND amazing special effects, that's the stuff the 'suspense of disbelief' is made of. Let's just hope it won't suffer from the same sequel-itis as the original.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I understand that it is fiction, but since we are having to accept talking apes, they could attempt to make something plausible. One easy way would be to change the date.  The movie starts in the distant future of 2029??  In 28 yrs we will have star trek like shuttle that can go in and out of orbit with a single stage and then travel across the solar system.  We will have a magnificent research center somewhere around saturn that has batteries that last thousands of years. I just can't wait to see what we will have before I am 50. The next big gripe is the uninhabited planet that has only apes and humans...and horses.  Where'd those horses come from?  While I appreciate the attempt to explain the source of the apes, it could have been much better.  How'd the apes rebel against the armed humans in the first place? I'm sure an ape can kick my butt, but I can blow it's head off with a gun. There are countless other problems with the movie that I don't feel like bringing up.  The movie was also slow for an action flick, two hours pass and you can count major moments on one hand. The final gripe is the ending which I won't ""spoil"" for anyone.  Try as hard as you want to defend it, but it makes absolutely no sense.  It was meant as a shocker, but the surprise came from how ridiculous it was.  People laughed in the theater where I was.

The whole cast is very good, especially Helena Bonham Carter, whose performance as the ape-woman Ari is witty, sharp and sweet. Two things: Chuck Heston should retire from films after this, since I can't imagine a better exit than the one this movie gives him, and the film's final gag is funny, but doesn't really make sense (especially in light of the story we've just seen).

One high point however has to be the talents of the actors playing the apes, their not just actors in costume but really become the apes they are portraying and for an instant you do feel like they are really talking, civilized apes. Much less can be said about the actors portraying the human slaves, I liked it better in the original when they couldn't talk.

He had NO RIGHT however messing with PLANET OF THE APES, a great film that was majorly under-valued critically (NOT at the box-office) even on its release in 1968. ""Are things so bad that BEN-HUR has to start mixing it with Gorillas?"" proclaimed one dumb-ass reviewer! Wonder what he would have written about this?Well guys for whats its worth, here's my assessment! In a word, INSULTING to the original! (and to anyone in the audience of moderate intelligence.) Obviously  geared towards two distinctly identifiable social groups: those who have never seen the original series and today's (for the most part) attention-deficient audiences, who just want some one-dimensional entertainment to accompany their popcorn (or ecstasy tablet). Burton is selling himself short here - he is worth more than that.
PLANET OF THE APES (2001) is not categorically a turkey, the special effects are excellent, although the incessant use of digitizing becomes wearisome eventually. What IS wrong with it is loopy Wahlberg as an intergalactic Captain....I mean could you take this guy seriously? Would YOU rather fly to Alpha Centauri with Chuck Heston at the controls or under the direction of some guy who flashes his ""jewels"" while boogeying?  Aimed at a ""youthful,"" marketable audience, sure he's your man, but in the interests of credibility, Wahlberg is a 10-1 longshot! The film suffers from ludicrously unstable continuity with a script to match - it is sheerly a visual extravaganza. Obviously in an attempt to play down the social and paradoxical issues of the original (coz you might have to actually THINK!) Burton has gone for noise and movement.The marvellous ending of the 1968 film (probably only ever equalled in power by THE USUAL SUSPECTS) is replaced by an obviously tacked-on ""lets not worry how to explain this - anything to leave us a sequel"" finale.  In the upshot, not the embarrassment Gus Van Sant's PSYCHO was, but totally unnecessary and totally unsatisfying!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So I was naturally very pleased to have my expectations surpassed by this film. I will say this right off the bat, POTA 2001 is inferior to the original, but who really expected it to be better than that one? Anyway, the film gets off to a great start and continues that way for about the first hour. First we get the basic story setup and the introduction of our hero (a perpetually indifferent Mark Wahlberg) but it doesn't take long for the primates (the real stars of the show) to show up and the action to get going. I can't go any further without mentioning Rick Baker's ape makeup-it's absolutely stunning, as are the actors behind the prosthetics. Tim Roth sneers and growls as Thade, the general with a serious chip on his shoulder. I would actually tense up when this guy would walk onto the screen-I think he reminded me of my dad who, like Thade, was always on edge with his temper. To balance that out is the always lovely and charming Helena Bonham Carter as a ""human rights activist"" (snicker) ape who takes a fancy to Wahlberg's Leo. She is all at once elegant, charming, sympathetic and, inspite of her being a primate, totally sexy! I know the gorgeous Estella Warren makes her film debut here (notice i didn't say ""acting debut""-she only says about 5 lines!), but when the 2 were on screen together I would always follow Helena Bonham Carter. Yes I was attracted to an ape. For that Carter deserves an Academy Award. Period. Also on board among others are Michael Clark Duncan as a rather intimidating gorilla and the always reliable Paul Giamatti as a slave trader. Anyway, I am rambling-let me get down to the meat of the review. Other merits of the film include fantastic set design and cinematograpy as well as Danny Elfman's thrilling score. And does it deliver the goods with the action? You bet! So here's where the film falls short: TOO MANY HOLE in the script! Glaring holes in both the story and character development make it hard for the viewer to get involved, and I felt like I was in the dark a few times. It seems that certain backstories would be established but never followed up on. Most perplexing is the ending. Sure enough it was a hell of a good ringer (don't worry I am not giving it away), but WHAT HAPPENED!? I consider myself a literate and introspective person (I followed ""Memento"" just fine thank you very much) but this ending just left me confused. Every possible answer I come up with is contradictory to the rest of the film, so I don't know. If anybody thinks they have it figured out, please email meI am welcome to any ideas!! Anyway, I think I have said enough-it's fun to look at and listen to, just don't think to hard because you won;t find anything there. Grade: a weak B or a very solid B-","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Marky Mark, er, Mark Wahlberg (excuse me) all muddied up running around a Tim Burton set and B. that they were even remaking this accidental classic, which easily near the top of America's Cheesiest Films Of All Times list (right below Blackula, Killer Tomatoes and Jon Waters' purposely cheesy farces of course).For those too young to remember, Planet of the Apes first appeared in 1968. It was a sensation with audiences and panned by critics. The costumes were state-of-the-art for the times and the sets were as other worldly as they could portray in a sixties Star Trek quazi-realism way.Those who enjoyed the first version(s) even passed up the concession stand goodies for fear of losing that comfy close-up seat. The suspense of what the apes would look with all the modern gizmos the FX folks have at their disposal nowadays was almost unbearable. Like with The Grinch's recent successful transformation into 21st century-gadget- hoopla- infused- bing- bam box-office magic, TPOA does not disappoint on that level.As for the the rest of the film? Well, the plot is as deep as Green Eggs and Ham and the ""human"" cast is about as exciting as an instructional video on an anal polyp removal from the lower bowel of a brown field mouse, yet still, mad-director Tim Burton left just enough camp to keep it, surprisingly, enjoyable.The story goes...Astronaut; Leo Davidson (Mark ""softly spoken"" Wahlberg) is aboard a space station USS Oberon, training primates to play Astronaut. One starry night he is told to send one of these Chimps out to research a menacing energy field approaching fast on their starboard side.
The ""canary in the coal mine"" never returns...So, Leo, bored with is mundane duties anyhow, jumps into a delta pod to rescue the fellow, and, surprise, gets transported through time to a place ruled by...He crash lands safely in an eerie swamp. But, before he can shake his banana dry, he is over run by a group of fear-for-their-lives types ricocheting through the forest being pursued by dressed, orating, violent apes. Leo is trapped, along with these ratty anorexic -Mad Max looking- extras each with a perpetual glaze over their faces like deer locked on headlights (or Nick Cage in an emotional scene), and sent to market. The market is run by Limbo (brilliant Paul Giamatti) a sleazy Orang creep.Leo and a boopsie faced tribe gal, Deana (Estella "" be careful of bimbo typecasting  dear"" Warren), meet in one of Limbo's human slave holding cells. She's smitten, but he's focused on his personal inner dialog, his sequel, ""Exit El Quicko from the Planet Of The Apes.""They end up working together and gather a few others including, human rights activist girly ape Ari (Helena Bonham Carter). They all escape the city and head to ""rendezvous"" with Leo's space colleagues who have been sending out a signal to him via his space age transmitter he rescued from his sunken space pod. The humans hope Leo is their savior fallen from the sky to save them from the mini-Kongs that suppress them. Leo hopes his friends are waiting for him, just over the mountain rangeThe fleeing party faces some pretty mean mother-apers en route to Shangri-La! One ape in particular, General Thad, (Tim Roth) hates humans in a Hitler- southern plantation owner-circa 1800 way. He wants the filthy creatures (humans) completely annihilated and is schmoozing with the ape senate to get his wish. Leo is just what the nefarious Thad ordered when praying to their almighty Semos for a sign the humans must all go. With Leo's frightening display of intelligence and back bone, the senate will be scared bananaless into giving Thad the Marshal Law decree he so desires.
Will Leo and his new tribal friends make it to the space command center before Thad's wicked army finds and crushes them? Is Leo the god they have waited for all these years? Could the last fight scene be tackier?Don't worry, I'm not ruining anything here for you...It's so telegraphed G.W. Bush would know the ending half way through. Okay, maybe right before the credits at least.The story is a tad blasé. You may find yourself adrift about the screen, looking for something to busy your brain when Mark and crew aren't battling the Apes. Which brings up a kind of humorous point of observation, Wahlberg's ""Leo"" has like three sentences of dialog in a scene, then smacko, he's immediately in primal combat again; like an odd ballet of film you watch and keep a mental metronome swaying in your head1-2-3 fight, 1-2-3 fight.TPOA is really all about the visual treats; like watching intense thespian Tim Roth bounce about like an extra at Ringling Bros. & Barnum Bailey Circus of the Cruel in his cute little money, er, ape suit. Tim Roth's ""Thad"" was super creepy. Hate oozes from his furry little pores to the point were you feared he may really have gone rabid. Even with all the schtufamagal Roth had burying his features, the feeling and depth from the actor beneath came through. Or Helena Bonham Carter, all made up in ten pounds of latex, a far cry from the West End beauty she is, for sure. Still a lady, even as an ape.Then there's MM Wahlberg. His picture is in Compton's Encyclopedia under ""example of the Male Homo Sapiens "" -In my version anyway The man's body is, simply, dare I say, perfect. He's a double cream serving of Pistachio Ice cream with a hidden layer of marshmallow fluff. Scrumptious. Leo was a dull character so MM's signature ""whisper"" delivery worked. I think i need a Boogie Nights fix...TPOA has quite a few exciting moments. Enough to recommend it. Those nostalgic for the original take heart- there's still only one Cornelious (Roddy McDowall) and this is not a replacement, it's just another look at a pretty wild concept , modernized for the new generation to enjoy.
An aside: Danny Elfman, Timmie's favorite music man, is back incahoots producing the film's score. As always, Elfman delivers a catchy, flowing gently ominous orchestration of notes.Snack recommendation: Banana nut pound cake and Pistachio ice cream.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

People who argue about it straying from the original movie don't seem to realize the 'original' movie is also a remake--of the book. And the original movie does not stick very close to the book, which is OK because neither the book nor the film are anything terribly stellar. Well, I don't really feel the same level of craft went into this film as Burton put into Sleepy Hollow, which might sound strange since Planet of the Apes has some of the most incredible visual effects your gonna see in a movie this year. The problem is, those effects didn't necessarily create the same level of immersiveness that Burton achieved with sleepy hollow. Some people moved like apes, others tried to move like apes, some people didn't try. Some costumes were extremely elaborate, some people just look like they had ape-muzzles fastened on to them. Visually it was a bit inconsistent, but very pleasing, so no complaints there. Of course, most of the problems come from the execution of the plot. I really had no idea how much of a non-actor Mark Wahlberg was until I saw this. His performance here reminded more of Kurt Russell's in Big Trouble in Little China. Who knows, maybe that's the point, but you really wonder why everyone started following him around since he just seems like a big jerk (I'm starting to think that is the joke of the film.) Some of the little homage lines to the Heston film were done in such an obvious fashion I'm afraid they will seem terrible upon multiple viewings. Well, the film is a full two hours long, and for all of that, it feels rushed, and a bit uncompelling, but we're also talking about a talking ape movie, so what do you want? As to development of the human characters, did anyone really care? Nova is hardly developed in the original (even though she can't talk), and I found myself wishing they were mute in this one as well. If everyone must reference back to the Heston film, then lets at least recall how uninterested the writers were in the humans then. Nothing has changed now, and I didn't find that a problem. If anything, I'd have liked to see a somewhat deeper ape culture--which is it stands seems less developed than in the Heston film. Yeah, the weird love triangle worked for me, I liked the somewhat abortive rivalry between atar and the other gorilla hanging out with Ari (sorry, can't recall his name), and a lot of other things were done really well here despite the over-all rushed feel. What I was most surprised to find though was that they kept the end of the book intact, and depending on how you read into the film, they actually kept the themes of the book intact--which suggests that apes rise to power simply because humans are too apathetic to keep them from doing so (not because of nukes or anything like that.) I imagine the new ending may throw some people, but this is the -original- ending, and I'm glad to see it back. Plus, getting to see apes dressed up as cops was pretty rewarding. Overall I thought this film was a blast, not art by any means, but in retrospect, none of the monkey films are art. They all have deep logical flaws (can someone please explain to me how evolution can result in chimpanzees, gorillas and orangutans all evolving into bipedal talking versions of exactly the same creatures simultaneously!!??) and are filled with bad acting, or Heston's particular take on bad acting, so in this sense, Burton's version comes out on top not necessarily for being the better film but for being the most entertaining (anyone remember how dull the original one was?), the least pretentious and over-all having the most monkey-laughs of all the other ape films combined. I can only hope they consider a sequel--perhaps something in the order of 'escape from the planet of the apes.'","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As an aspiring film maker, I understand that in order to get paid, one must first appease the investors, (studio's). Burton however has managed to do this, without compromising his art, up until now. It seemed that Burton wanted to make a...for lack of a better word, darker movie, that addressed some perverse issues, but was forced to back up by a force off camera.  (Perhaps the whole bestiality issue would have been interesting?)  there were plenty of other issues that could've been explored but weren't. I loved the little details however, the ape with the music box and the human midget as his pet, it was great, you really got a sense of culture, I just wish I saw more of it.  Many of the issues in the film were greatbut there could've been more. I also felt that the political aspect of the film wasn't addressed.  Perhaps a scene that took place in the ape senate would have been interesting.  (Or maybe that's just the Sparticus inside me talking?) I really would have liked to see Glen Shadix a bit more. As usual, the film was visually stunning...but for the first time ever, I feel that Burton has sacrificed substance for style.  The film was eye-candy indeed, but lacked that human, (or ape...sorry), quality. Marky's character was also lacking.  He was the outsider, Burton's on-screen alter-ego...why would Burton not developed him more?  Burton's renowned for glorifying the ""outsider""...how could he let this one slip?  He got Carter's character right, why would he over-look the obvious freak? Last but not least is Elfman.  His score was lacking as well.  That beautiful sense of pensiveness or melancholy wasn't present in this score. Perhaps I'm getting too picky, but like so many others, I expected so much more. I'm not criticizing Burton for ""selling out""(after-all, isn't that the goal of every director)?  And I didn't think this was a bad movie, as a matter of fact, I liked it and thought it was a good movieI just hope that Burton doesn't compensate his art for the sake of a sequel again.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I never thought that the original needed remaking, nor that it could be bettered (the twist ending, along with the Usual Suspects, is one of the best I have EVER seen), but nevertheless, I thought that, if anyone, Burton could put his own fresh, dark spin on the idea. However, the whole thing gave an impression of a Burton being constricted by studio bosses hungry to chock up another Summer hit by throwing in everything including the kitchen sink- check out the extras-filled DVD if ya don't believe me.  Nice idea, wrong director. Burton is unparalleled for his alternative-style movies like the classic Edward Scissorhands. Here it felt like he was on a leash, his creativity tragically stunted.The make-up effects weren't much of an improvement on those of 1968, which only serves to highlight the superiority of the original. The acting, well, apart from those who were struggling under their ape-suits(Roth,Bonham-Carter,Clarke-Duncan), was poor- I agree with another reviewer who said that Wahlberg wasn't yet strong enough to carry off an action lead, and as for Estella Warren, well, I think we all know that she was only there to provide some Raquel Welch-style eye candy. The music,from the always dependable Elfman,was superb. The ending: lets face it, it was always going to be compared to the original's which, if not impossible, would be pretty damned hard to better. The ending to Burton's felt silly and tacked on,and smacked of  an overall air of ""please, be shocked!"" whereas it actually only left punters scratching their heads and looking for refunds.If you're curious, wait until the video rental price drops down. If not a Burton or sci-fi fan steer well clear.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Soon afterwards I rented the original movie and realised it's better, but not much. The new movie is more visually intriguing (Thank God for Tim Burton),the makeup and costumes are far better, but it misses the things that made the original so good and famous: originality (After all, it is a remake), Charlton Heston in the main role, and that ""Somewhere in space must be something better than a man"" concept. Supporting actors, however, are better (especially Tim Roth as General Thade) and it's very entertaining to watch. All in one, it is a good movie, but not something you would like to put on your top-list, especially next to the original.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Tim Burton's imagination makes the new Planet of the Apes a wonder to watch and look at.  As with every Tim Burton film, there are certain things that aren't necessary...I could have taken or left the ending.  But there is plenty to like about this film, more likeable than not.  The only major flaw with the film was casting Mark Wahlberg...and thank the almighty, that he doesn't have enough screen presence for us to even pay attention to what he's saying.  I found myself sort of skipping over Wahlberg's part and paying more attention to the real stars of the movie...those damned dirty apes.  Rick Baker will win an Oscar for his makeup...(you've done your job if the actors are unrecognizable).  General Thade is a villain we can all love to hate and Tim Roth should be proud of the job he did in bringing this character to life.  I was convinced of his genuine evil.  Helena Bonham Carter and Michael Clarke Duncan were almost equally as convincing and I hope to see all 3 of them back in the next movie.Tim Burton has gained my respect.  He surprised me with Sleepy Hollow and has me back on his good list with Planet of the Apes.  His storytelling abilities have improved and he's toned down the ""unbelievable silliness"" factor (IE Edward Scissorhands, Batman Returns, Any of the Pee Wee movies). Instead of going nuts with how bizarre the characters can be, he redirects his talents into making you FEAR the Apes...as in Sleepy Hollow, you FEAR the Headless Horseman.  So much that you're fascinated with how evil these villains are.There's no need to talk about the genius of Danny Elfman's musical talents. He's been doing it for years and if anyone knows how to make even an average movie come to life, it is Elfman.Kudos to Burton....a well done film, minus Marky Mark.  He'll get it right next time.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In greek theater, they used to make use of Deus Ex Machina, which literally means ""God from a Machine."" Just when the plot seemed like it couldn't be untangled, or the hero couldn't win, they would lower one actor (playing a God) on pulleys and ropes. He would suddenly right all that was wrong.Here it is in modern day cinema. Big fight seen with the hero in trouble. Big explosion in the sky and down comes a spaceship with a test-monkey in it, which turns out to be the God off all the apes. Of course it saves the hero, Mark Wahlberg.

If you are lucky you might be able to answer 1, possibly 2 or even three if you are very open minded (personally I've got one, John Carpenter's The Thing 1982).  Well Mr Burton knows that movie patrons and critics are very critical when it comes to the remaking of a classic film, especially if it is one of their personal favorites.  Thats why from the very conception planet of the apes 2001 was never intended to be a remake of the original classic film.  This seems to be the biggest handicap everyone seems to have getting in the way of actually giving this movie a fair shake.  I enjoyed this movie.  It wasn't a waste of 2 hours. I did like the original movie better.

The special effects in this movie were, as usual,Tim Burton amazing, however the story-line was a little weak and hard to follow.  Mark Wahlberg was of course his sexy self - his brooding good looks make the weak plot more enjoyable.  It seems with every movie he does his acting ability increases, I felt that he played the character very well.

But nothing prepared me for this disappointment.Dialogue: From the quotes from the original PotA to the Rodney King quote ""Can't we all just get along?!?"", the dialogue is the most contrived and asinine I have heard in a long time.  Even worse than Titanic.Plot: Any simpler could not have been possible.  Witholding the interest of the viewer becomes a practical impossibility. Character development:  zilch.  The only character I remotely cared about was Pericles.  ALL other characters were left blank - and oh so boring.Cinematography: Everything occurred in darkness or in confusing shots of mass battles between humans and simians.And was it necessary to hit us over the head continuously, with a VERY heavy hand, with the  fact that ""!!!Hey!!!  These are APES and they act like HUMANS!!!!"" Seems like Burton just couldn't get over it...As for the ending...  What the h?!?  It was nonsensical, non logical, and yet SO predictable.For the record: I fought sleepiness throughout the first half and I had to leave the theater and go for a little walk to wake myself up.  When I returned, about 10 minutes later, I asked my wife ""Did I miss anything?"" Her answer: ""Nope.""It really saddens me to write such a bad review - I was looking forward to this movie so much!  As it turns out, Burton sank all his budget into costumes and makeup, leaving us with a tasteless-as-cardboard summer slam-fest/FX flick with no redeeming value.Stay away from this one and rent the first three of the original series instead!PS: Zira would have howled with laughter at the sight of the female apes in this one.

History has not been very kind to the 1968 classic which featured the likes of Roddy McDowall (Lassie, Flicka), the beautiful Kim Hunter (A Streetcar Named Desire) and Charlton Heston, who must have had a lot of explaining to do to his fundamentalist friends for appearing in the original evolution epic and this remake. (Then again, aside from a couple of sandal sagas, his whole career cries out for an explanation), but for a generation it remains one of the most shockingly effective films of its time.This time we get Helena Bonham Carter in the culmination of her costume drama career, looking for all the world like Michael Jackson in drag (as if that wouldn't be redundant), Paul Giamatti, delightful and yet somehow wasted as an aging orang-utan, Kris Kristofferson, as the good guy we can't wait to see snuffed, and, of course, Marky Mark, surprisingly effective in his biggest film to date sans the monumentally untalented George Clooney. (No, Boogie Nights wasn't THAT big.)First of all, the monkey suits were killer!  It was unsettling at first, and then just plain eerie, to see talking apes that looked real, instead of the laughable effect of the original.  Who else but Rick Baker could have worked such magic?  Along with Tim Burton and Danny Elfman, this talented trio simply could not fail.  Still, there are problems.Visually, the film is flawless, thanks to Burton.  But there are holes big enough to drive a truck through if you care to take pot shots.  On the other hand, you could just sit back and be amused for a couple of hours, in which case you could do much worse.  So here's the skinny.  Marky Mark chases a chimp into a space storm in an attempt to rescue him.  He goes through a worm hole and ends up on a planet ruled by apes.  The humans rally... oh heck, why bother.  It's the same film as in 1968.  Got it?  There are a couple of twists that I can't reveal without spoiling the film, but let's just say the screenwriter had to earn his fee somehow.  And the ending?  Well, remember what I said about the truck.This film has been on the drawing board for what seemed like an eternity, and I'm still wondering what happened to Schwarzenegger.  Instead we get Marky Mark?  Well I guess those monkey suits were expensive.  I suppose there could have been a little more humor, and it would have been nice to see the tension between Carter, Wahlberg and Estella Warren played up a bit, but then Warren proves why models don't always make good actors; actors have to act.The high points of this movie, I suppose, were Michael Clarke Duncan as Attar the gorilla and Tim Roth as the evil chimpanzee General Thade.  It can't be easy to act inside that get up, but they pull it off magnificently.What can I say?  This is one you just can't miss, if only for the historical comparison.  It's a guilty pleasure, so indulge.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Truly loved that fact that Tim took the old story and gave it a totally new look and meaning.Make-up aside, the actors must have worked quite hard with someone who knew primates of varying ""classes,"" and while I have to admit that I was hard-pressed to believe ""interspecies relationships,"" considering the various mixed marriages of humans, why not primates?Someone stated they didn't like the movie because the primates couldn't swim across the water.  Ever do any research?  It's true, they don't swim; they sink and drown.  And anyone who has ever been to the zoo should ask the keepers about the accuracy of some of the primates with various ""missiles"" such as food or feces.

What a blow to the NRA! :)I loved Tim's use of action, movement, reality, fear, emotion and just plain FUN throughout the whole show.Perhaps some of the people who really didn't like the movie should go once more, with a very open mind, and see the movie for what it is: an excellent story of what COULD be, WILL be, or WAS...Grade from our family: A+","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I quickly replied ""No kidding.""  For the next two hours we analyzed and reanalyzed Burton's ""re-imagining,"" which turned out to be two hours of completely and utterly nonsensical filmmaking.  However, Burton was TRYING to explain the course in which he thought that the human evolutionary pattern is following. For those who have seen the movie, you would remember that Leo's pod crash landed around 2400, when he had left from the 22nd century. The apes on the planet had said that the ruins of the origin of the apes was thousands of years old. This explains that the Oberon when passing through the electrical storm went back in time thousands of years. IF we say that the planet of the apes is really earth we can deduce that in the end when apes ruled present day it was because the oberon had crashed before Leo's departure from it. Because the ship's apes took over thousands of years ago they built up their technology the same as we had in our present day. Burton therefore is suggesting that the apes civilization fell and they were reverted to their ancient primitive ways. Then Leo crashed. Therefore although Leo was trying to make it back to his time, it no longer existed!PS.  I went to this movie thinking that even if it was bad, Burton's visuals would be nice as they usually are but all I received was two hours of run-of-the-mill scenes, with nothing special whatsoever.In conclusion, the only thing good about this movie was the music.

Not a 10 but maybe 6 or 7 like the newer Lost in space.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

He used to be one of my favorite directors. His unique style and flavor were evident in all of his films. He brought a type of originality to film making that was very enjoyable. But in recent years, he's been slipping. And in Planet of the Apes, he seems to have slipped even more. More than ever, his style and creativity are gone. Even in his poorer films, anyone watching could see clearly that it was a Burton film. But after seeing Planet of the Apes, I was tempted to check the credits to make absolutely sure that he had anything to do with the making of this movie. It was terrible. And anyone who has enjoyed this movie has done so for the worst of reasons, namely the visuals, i.e. the ape make-up. These same people defend this new movie by saying that it was not supposed to be a true remake of the original, but I say, so what? If you're going to do a movie that's already been done, at least make an attempt to do something better than the original. Maybe the first movie didn't have supreme special effects, but it is a classic because it was a well written and well directed movie, which this new movie is not. Visuals aren't enough to make a great movie. If all I cared about was realistic looking apes, I'd go to a zoo. ~Christopher","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is a watchable movie and as far as the big movies of the summer, it is the best of the bunch. However, it is still very much a movie that misses its mark. The main problem is the fact that this movie does not have a lot of action in it. It is a movie that is primed for action, a movie that from the beginning of it promises action, and never ever delivers. All of the make-up, all of the ape like movements are all layed to waste as the movie tries, I believe, to be too much of a social satire as opposed to a good old action flick. The acting is good, and all of the ""ape"" actors are superb as they look, act, and even move like apes. Roth is wonderful as the evil villian of the movie, Duncan is perfect as the ever imposing general who carries out all of Roths biddings, and Carter is brilliant as the human rights activist who helps the Humans as much as she can. Walhberg is good, but not great, yet he is never really able to explode in the role. Yes, I understand that an ape, no matter what size, is stronger than a human but hey, this is a movie. Lets have at least one scene where Mark kicks the sh*t out of one of the apes. You never get the sense that Walhberg is truly anything more than the others besides the will to challenge the apes, but it seems everyone joins in that effort all too easily. He isn't stronger, or seemingly smarter than the rest, who seem surprisingly intelligent for a beaten and battered species who are constantly denegraded. Despite that Walhberg does do a good job of putting his part over. As I said, the main problem is the lack of action. Burton missed the boat on this one, and while it is serviceable and with what is out there now I would recommend it to most people, it could have been so much better. I love Burtons movies and he has rarely dissapointed me, but I do believe he should have gone another way with this film, or at least picked a way to go. See this movie, it is worth it for the make-up and the acting, but if you want to see a truly wonderful movie rent the original.That movie knew what it wanted to be and never strayed. This one is just a little too confused about its direction. Oh, by the way, the twist ending is pretty cool, and will I believe spark a debate amoung those you go with.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

the ape world that burton creates is similar to the original, humans are slaves to apes, the exception in this case is that the humans can speak...
after a number of in-jokes for die hard fans and guest cameo's etc, the movie settles in to tell it's story... with the original movie giving it's shock ending, i wasn't sure where the answers would come from, but the script was wonderfully inventive with the matter it had to work with. a number of different aspects are explored in this movie that were covered across the entire apes series.and so is it any good? i think, if you liked the original movie and the series then you'd find it interesting to watch just to see what they did with the story. if you don't what all the fuss is about, perhaps don't bother... i don't think this would work as a movie on it's own...interestingly, a lot of people seem confused about the ending, stating it doesn't make sense. i agree... there are no ""clues"" given about as to why the movie ends that way, so just run with it... enjoy the irony, laugh at the audacity and unfullfilled expectations and sit back and wait for inevitable sequel ;)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film stressed more, OZ style sets and costumes and great backdrops over gunplay. The script and story had a few continuity problems (probably  due to editing) yet the film is a great update of the first two movies. I think the original series warts and all is the best. I liked this film and primarily the "" camp by the water sequence"" for the lighting and art direction. The film features an all star costumed cast. In the opening on the space station the name on whalbergs suit reads briefly ""wahlberg"". PLANET OF THE APES main problem was it's ""too quick"" resolution of the conflict and not enough exploration of the FORBIDDEN ZONE. A good film and well told also imaginative on the visuals and TOLKIEN novel visual flair. This is perhaps TIM BURTONS best film. Of note is the genre classic line ""okay guys we only got one shot at this"". The apes were too realistic I am a fan of the original chambers designs...yet these were utterly life like. Of note is the surprise ending in keeping with the 1973-74 animated series and an origianl draft by serling. One more note...the forbidden zone sequences look like some of the story boards for the DEHN scripted sequel.

No, it's not as good as the original of 1968, but it really is an entertaining movie.  The make-up they used to create the illusion of apes being the dominant species is breathtaking and quite realistic looking.  I'd say that's one of the strongest points of the film.As for the storyline, it is changed up from the original.  In fact, it is a very different story all together.  However, this does not change the fact that this is a good movie and I'm willing to bet just about anyone who goes to see it will like it too.You've probably all heard about the surprise ending (which isn't that much of a surprise... me and my friend managed to guess it right!) DOES make sense.  Really, trust me it does.  I don't know, certain people might look at it from certain and different angles... but I managed to come to the conclusion that no matter what time or planet your on, the apes still manage to evolve and overtake the humans.  That may not make much sense to you if you haven't seen the movie, but it will.All in all, I do recommend seeing this movie.  I went to see it with my friends and we all agree it was a good movie.

As a result, the audience never stops to think, or worry, or wonder.Because the story is racing, the characters are never developed.What we want is: a roller coaster ride, where riders are hurled and twisted and turned and jerked around, with lofty highs and gut-sinking lows.What we get is: a rocket ride, shooting at a target 2 miles away, straight ahead, with the end always in sight and closing quickly.It's okay, but not great.

I love Tim Burton's work; and I was greatly intrigued by the new APES movie idea.  For two full hours, I was thoroughly convinced that this was the best movie I've seen all year. Better than Proof of Life, better than X-Men, better than Moulin Rouge, better than The Pledge, Traffic, or Shrek.  I was minutes away from leaving this movie in awe.Then, the walls came a-crumblin' down.I thought that this ""reimagining"" had many great additions to the plot that were excluded from the Heston classic:  an explanation of the origin of the ape population and intelligence, the early fate of the humans, the origination of the holy scripts of the ape culture, a reasonable and more realistic adaptation of evolved apes (keeping some ape attributes in the process), and a less predictable twist-of-fate discovery on the foreign planet by the hero.  This time, it's not Earth he discovers, just like the pre-movie trailers say it isn't, but he discovers his role in the history of the planet.  It works well, as does the whole plot, in a wonderfully designed planet with great costumes and backgrounds.  It was an A+ movie until the ending.I had heard that Burton filmed many endings for this film and then chose one.  If this is true, then I have a great idea for him:  send out the alternate endings in the next coming weeks and tell the public you've done so.  Let us see the different endings on the big screen, never knowing which one is with the movie! It would be a real first, and would give us a chance to make peace with the end of this movie.The end of this movie, of course, being the only part of the movie that was not spectacular.It's not that we movie fans don't love a surprise ending, or a happy ending, or an unhappy ending, or a predictable ending;  it's just that we do like it to make sense.  The ending of this movie makes absolutely no sense, none. It is in logical, chronological, and collossal error.  It does not correspond with anything else in the movie, and it simply makes no sense whatsoever.  This is perhaps the worst ending of a movie since Waterworld, and ruins what was over two hours of the best movie I've seen all summer. It was a great movie, it should have ended greatly.  I give it an A++ for two hours or so, and an F-- for the last few minutes.

Also I'm an admirer of director Tim Burton's innovative work in such movies as `Batman', so I looked forward to Burton's effort at `re-imagining' Pierre Boulle's imaginative novel. Sadly the result is nothing to go ape about.As one would expect with Burton, the work has a distinctive and impressive look, even if it is frequently as much Gothic as gorilla. The location shooting in Hawaii and Arizona and the prosthetics of five-times-Oscar-winner Rick Baker give the film strength. The problem  as so often in today's Hollywood  is the script which seems to have been produced by sitting a bunch of chimps in front of some keyboards. Much of the dialogue is risible and the thoughtfulness and sharpness of Schaffner's work is missing.
Mark Wahlberg, in the role of the lost spaceman Leo Davidson, is adequate, but he does not have the presence or the anger that made Heston's performance so powerful. In fact, Heston makes a cameo appearance in this re-make and manages to reprise his 1960s closing line. Many of the other stars, who include Tim Roth (`Reservoir Dogs') and Michael Clarke Duncan (`The Green Mile'), can only be recognised by their voices.In the original, Taylor was fleeing Earth because war and famine had caused him to become totally disillusioned with mankind. In the reprise, Davidson is desperate to return to the Earth he knows, even though he is on a planet where he finishes up with a God-like status among both men and apes and he can choose between the bee-sting lips of Estella Warren and the simian charms of Helena Bonham-Carter. Anyone that silly deserves what he finds in a brave, but essentially futile, attempt to provide a variation on the 1968 ending.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I will be outlining the plot, or lack thereof, in my critique.Several years ago, legendary scriptwriter William Goldman lamented that it was no longer fun to ridicule current films.  The present author agrees, citing Hollywood's limited imagination and obsession with proper packaging. One example can be found in Tim Burton's `reimagined' Hollywood's classic, Planet of the Apes.  Mr. Burton is known for the Batman series, The Nightmare before Christmas, and Beetle juice.  His Planet of the Apes is another dark foreboding film aimed at summer moviegoers.
Burton correctly did not compete with the original movie's screenplay written by Rod Serling.  The creator of The Twilight Zone was inspired by Pierre Boulle's satirical novel Monkey Planet.  Now one can buy the novelization of the Tim Burton film.  As one local paper observed, Burton created another contemporary action film.   A US Air Force pilot marooned on a strange planet, pleas for us to love our neighbors, as we would love ourselves.  In other words, Batman passed through the Stargate to discover EnemyMine.  The author is grateful that he did not have to pay to see this forgettable remake.  However, one should keep perspective and view this film as part of Hollywood's highly successful strategy as an electronic baby sitter. Its core audience is probably unaware that Planet of the Apes launched the first commercially viable nerdocracy nine years before Star Wars.What was Planet's secret?  Great costumes, breath taking special effects, eye-catching explosions, token comic relief and of course sex appeal. The film team cut and pasted this formula onto the script but added his trademark: darkness protects evildoers.  Instead of swaggering through Gotham's streets, these nefarious characters literally swing from tree to tree.  Then our hero with the subtle last name of Davidson leads his people into the Wilderness.   Meanwhile eye candy masquerading as characters diverts the male lead's attention: Helen Bonham Carter and Estella Warren. His young male audience secure, Burton enlisted living legends Charleton Heston and Kris Kristofferson ostensibly to develop the plot.  However, the author suspects they were bait to lure the Baby Boomer generation.
Thus, one can discern a movie's full power without distractions like plot or dialogue. One applies this Zen-like state when watching Burton's film. You should suspend disbelief when learning that the US Air Force in 2068 cannot prevent a rogue space launch. Then Mark Walberg, our Rambo-like hero, travels thousands of years into the future not because of technology. He is a cosmic Dorothy sucked into a space tornado that accelerates his vehicle past 88 miles per hour.  Once in Oz, the newly arrived prophet reveals several millennia of tradition as a lie.
How does he do it one might ask?  Because Marky Mark is charismatic and bright.  His character only needs a couple of days to gather a band of followers and discover the ruins of his old space station.  Somehow falling out of orbit, the facility's nuclear power plant and computers still work. Our intrepid Spaceman discovers the truth:  On Space Station Oberon, human and apes astronauts lived in happiness.  Then the chimp Semos, like the Serpent in the Garden of Evil, spread hate.Apparently, Burton's filmmaking team believes that current moviegoers are unable to grasp ambiguity.  Whereas the original film showed a world of mute humans, Burton's world is one where man had nothing to say.  Heston's conflict at the ruins in the Forbidden Zone revolved around the clash of ideas.  Kung-fu trained gorillas fought  ideological issues the original film never resolved.In conclusion, the author believes he is too harsh.  After all, the movie had hot leads, good production values and the plot was enough to keep me awake.  My favorite part was ending, partially because the torture was over. However, another reason was Burton's ending was reminiscent of Boulle's finale.  In the novel, our hero lands his spacecraft at a Paris airfield is met by a police car.  Which was driven by a gorilla.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Of course, nothing can beat the original classic, but this is jsut as exciting and fun. the speciall effects were amazing. unlike most movies these days (jurassic park 3, pearl harbor) that use the F/X as the main star, POTA does not. the F/X are not overdone, and when used, they are fantastic. Tim Roth, Mark Wahlberg, and even Estella Warren give good performances that are top notch. overall, the new story that is followed closely to the first movie, is fantastic, and i reconmend this flick as long as you don't compare it to the original.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","Planet of the Apes starts out like a dream and gladly I fall into its surreal and beautifully produced reality, only to be jolted awake by my constant disappointment with the dialogue and character developme","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0512258/?ref_=tt_urv","misshiss","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1303877/?ref_=tt_urv","10 August 2001","I have not seen any of the previous ""Planet Of The Apes"" movies, so my review is purely based on this film's success as an entertaining Hollywood flick. That said, ""Planet Of The Apes"" succeeds in many ways as just that. The fast-paced plot moves along nicely, and the colorful special effects awed me into partial submission. Indeed, if I wasn't such an intelligent human, I might be able to close the part of my brain that yearns for better character development as well as some dialogue that stimulates a human above kindergarden age. Perhaps, what I suspect is true; that Tim Burton is partial to the apes, and truly believes that us humans aren't really that intelligent.Most of the characters in ""Planet Of The Apes"" do things for no good reason. Mark Wahlberg's character risks his life for a monkey for no reason. Helena Bonham Carter's character risks her life for a human for no reason. Neither one of these characters has a history that warrants such actions- yet they forge ahead with such heroic impulse! Estella Warren's character just shouldn't even be in the movie. In fact, I didn't really notice her until the end when Mark Wahlberg kisses her for no apparent reason- did he steal glances at her that I didn't notice? Did he really have time to notice her ""t and a"" while escaping from the apes and planning a battle? The only character which was developed was Thade. There is a scene with his father that explains why he hates humans so much.In a movie where dialogue is sparse, sentences are loaded. When a character opens his mouth, the audience has expectations.Hollywood action movies always have some one line jokes. In this movie that's all there is. Action sequences are interrupted by marvels such as ""don't touch me you stinking human"", or ""in my planets monkeys live in cages and beg for treats"". These utterances only serve to emphasize what we already know from the intense visuals. It feels like they were placed there to help the PG audience understand what is going on. It's as if Tim Burton is telling the audience ""Look guys, the humans and the apes don't get along on this planet. I mean they really don't get along. Get it?They don't get along. Get it?""Okay, I've already spent too much time on this review.  I wish the producers of this movie had spent as much  time on their script! Oh wait I didn't explain the surprise ending! That's okay, the movie didn't either.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was beautifully crafted, from the very realistic ape make-ups by Rick Baker to the actions acted by the actors. Though critics may be divided by this one, it is a summer movie. Something you will watch to have fun and be surprised. This remake is very reimaged. This means that people should expect something extra with this film but what the film gave was 10 times that people expected which is good. The sound is good. The cinematography is very clear. But the story may be quite simple than what people expect. The actors were very in to it. All in all, the film has good sides and bad but see for fun and for summer.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
