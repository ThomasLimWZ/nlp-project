One is a Ms. Marvel fan and the other is now. For me I was hoping for something that children and adults could enjoy. But, no only kids will enjoy this silly mess.I enjoyed the Captain Marvel movie and thought the criticism was not warranted. I also loved Wanda Vision and the introduction of Monica Rambeau and I was hoping for at least a good continuation of her story. I didn't watch Ms. Marvel because I'm not a teen and I knew it wasn't for me; and after watching her parts in this movie I'm glad I stuck to that.All three actresses are good and of course Samuel L in always a pleasure to see, but none of the other characters including the so-called villain were the least bit interesting. Most of the scenes were just downright silly. I hope they continue Monica's story with better writing and I wish Marvel would stop being silly and go back to making movies for adults and kids.","385 out of 511 found this helpful.

It feels as if this film was edited and chopped into pieces during post and it shows.Couple things I enjoyed, I did like seeing Carol Danvers and Monica Rambeau resolve and acknowledge their relationship, but due to the nature of their characters being straight arrows, it allows Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan to be the audience just as Tom Holland's Peter Parker was in CIVIL WAR. I did not particularly enjoy the MS. MARVEL series, but I can see her being the shoutout for many.I think the script just touched on the surface of Brie Larson's Captain Marvel herself, so diving into her more is a plus, however the story did her no favors once again and I did feel like she was given like four or five pieces of direction to portray her character compared to the more one-note performance in the first film. Teyonah Parris is commendable. She was the more science-y of the trio.Samuel L. Jackson just feels inconsistent especially after SECRET INVASION. Feels like this Nick Fury is a variant. He's simply passing through in this film.Another thing I liked was the incursions (also briefly touched on in DOCTOR STRANGE IN THE MULTIVERSE OF MADNESS). We all complained about the lack of planting seeds for the future leading into KANG DYNASTY and SECRET WARS. Finally, this film it at least preps and teases what's to come down the line.The MCU's villain problem is a long known fact, but here it only cements their problem even further. Now I'm a fan of Lee Pace's over the top performance as Ronan, but Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton is literally a copy and paste of Ronan, but female. Nothing new about it. Definitely up there as one of the worst villains in the MCU.The power swaps were kinda cool so I can give it that. Nia DaCosta does a good job executing the fight scenes, but again as one should expect, VFX is meh. Now if you cringed during the musical note duel between the two Doctor Strange, then wait till you see one segment of the film where it feels like a misplaced musical. Lots of quirky and annoying humor like one should expect in an MCU film.The Skrulls are in the film and as a fan we always think we can write the better film after watching it, but I just DO NOT understand why this sequel couldn't have been SECRET INVASION(one of the worst MCU Disney+ shows). SECRET INVASION honestly should have been an Avengers film or at the very least a Captain Marvel sequel co-starring some Avengers, kinda like CIVIL WAR. I personally feel like that dilemma could have furthered Captain Marvel's development due to her involvement with them and how she's equally to blame for not helping them out when she and Fury promised to find them a home. But instead she's stuck with this material.The mid-credit scene is arguably the best part. Once again teasing things to come. It's stuff that like that, that will maybe still garner interest in the MCU despite its current fall from grace. The end-credit scene is alright. Not particularly jazzed about that promise down the line.On that note, the recent Variety article published about Marvel Studios talked about their behind the scenes trouble. It was said that Kevin Feige and his creative committee partook in their yearly Palm Springs retreat to regroup and refocus, so here's hoping to next year being more consistent with quality. Seemed like he was spread too thin with the mandate to have more quantity than quality.THE MARVELS is a season 1.5 for MS. MARVEL and a CAPTAIN MARVEL sequel that we never saw due to the flashbacks and exposition to explain things. And let's be clear, at this point everything feels like homework. That was going to be inevitable moving forward after INFINITY WAR and ENDGAMGE, but especially when Disney+ was announced making Kevin Feige spread out too thin. But it only feels like homework because everything that has been released is below the standard of what Marvel set up for us.So to sum it up, while I did find it slightly more appealing than the first CAPTAIN MARVEL and QUANTUMANIA, that isn't saying much. Low expectations definitely helped. Is THE MARVELS one of the worst? No, but it definitely belongs way down below the list.5/10.","439 out of 762 found this helpful.

Iman Vellani and her on-screen family were highlights of the often underwhelming Ms Marvel, so it's great to see them all again here. Brie Larson puts in another charismatic performance as Captain Marvel, nicely balancing her cockiness and rashness - clearly attributes she had even before she became ultra-powerful and unlikely to to be softened by it - with humour and endearing awkwardness. Teyonah Parris as Monica is the brains of the trio, and the chemistry and camaraderie between these three lead actors is what makes it so engaging. Plus Samuel L Jackson as Nick Fury is, of course, always ridiculously cool.It's probably the case that a lot of what happens here won't make a lot of sense if you've not seen a lot of the previous MCU adventures, particularly Captain Marvel, Ms Marvel and WandaVision. And despite the world-ending threat, it seems somehow insubstantial. But it doesn't take itself too seriously and has a wacky comic-book vibe, and I found it an enjoyable watch. There's been way too much MCU content churned out in recent years, and it seems likely that some of these characters won't get another outing as a result of a probably overdue cull, but I think that would be a pity. I do hope we'll get to see their continuing adventures.","4 out of 4 found this helpful.

Confusing.I had hoped that following Guardians 3 it could've get much worse for the Marvel universe, at least Guardians has Rocket😂It's hard to find any plot to this movie. Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) does throw a lot of people through the roof but the plot is a quantum entanglement mess. The movie is blissfully short but feels longer as it's so bad and some people walked out of the theatre. I was so pleasantly when it ended.I think it's about to retire the whole Marvel superhero franchise as this phase is going badly.","194 out of 325 found this helpful.

Anyhow, this was an absolute mess.The writing was clearly problematic, it doesn't gel, it is genuinely all over the place. I do very much wonder if huge sections of this film cut? It can be the only answer, it just doesn't flow at all, and that short run time...Special effects, some were pretty good, some were poor, I just wish there was a greater focus on plot, it just seemed like 100 minutes of CGI, noise and random events.Brie Larson, I'm not sure about you, but to me she looked totally disinterested and bored by the whole thing, what I didn't see, was someone committed to the role. I thought Samuel Jackson was rather good, but again poorly served by the script.It didn't look great from the trailers, and in reality, it's another clunker from Marvel Studios.4/10.","1,029 out of 1,417 found this helpful.

It's not ""a work of art"" but I enjoyed it much more than a lot of the recent Marvel movies - and it is a lot more even than some of the recent ones. It's very character driven.The three main characters are delightful - and I had seen WandaVision and Ms Marvel to understand who Monica Rambeau and Kamala Khan were - but my wife hadn't and seemed to enjoy it too (no explanations of powers required - you could see them).The opening is bit confusing - but it was confusing for the characters too so that makes more sense - and the 3 characters soon settled in as a team. The story was basic but made sense and the ""antagonist"" was so-so. Nick Fury was a bit low-key so it was really the Marvels' film - which was nice.Seeing Kamala's family again was great too.I definitely enjoyed it - and it will be one of the Marvel films I probably will watch on repeat a lot.Yes, there is a brief part with a species who speak in song - but we have one of the best Star Trek TNG episodes with a species who speak in allegories so? I'm glad I ignored the low ratings because I'd heard the ""if you liked Captain Marvel you'll like this"" comment from multiple sources that I value and totally agree.","60 out of 106 found this helpful.

Fortunately, the movie fulfills the trailer's promiseIn the movie, three superheroes with related powers find themselves suddenly swapping places with one another. The proves to be a good gimmick for both action and comedy, as the three keep finding themselves in one another's battles. Eventually, they master the situation in order to take down a very angry villain with an unusually sympathetic backstory.The movie leans heavily - and for the most part successfully - into the comedy. A big chunk of this is fueled by the teenage Captain Marvel fangirl Ms. Marvel, who is from a TV series I found too pre-teen-oriented to enjoy. Ms. Marvel's an annoying character but for the most part I found her amusing in this.There's also a funny gag with alien cats.While I enjoyed this movie, I have to admit its a bit of an unfocussed mess. There are a lot of elements just tossed in, like a whole thing with Marvel #3, Monica, dealing with her abandonment issues. These occasional ""emotional"" moments don't much interest me.Anyway, a lot of people hate this, but if you like the trailer, I'd say chance the movie (I did not take a chance on the last Aquaman movie because unlike The Marvels, the trailer looked just as bad as people said the movie was.Going against the current, I say if you want a bunch of comedy and some fun action then you should watch this one.","55 out of 99 found this helpful.

Post Avengers Endgame, these projects have been feeling more and more like content than cinema (except the rare surprises like GOTG 3). Superhero fatigue, they call it and this movie does practically nothing but to amp it up to 11.You watch the trailer, you know what happens. You bet on originality, you end up homeless. There's nothing new for me to say that I haven't already said about any of the other MCU content as of late. It's so generic that I'm confident a year from now, no one would remember this movie even existed. With every new MCU project, the jokes-per-minute ratio keeps getting worse, the villains are a writer's version of a stock photograph (I can't even remember the villain's name in this movie and it hasn't even been a day since I watched it), the CGI is so out there you can almost see the CGI artists' tears on screen, and it's getting more and more difficult to tell each MCU project apart cos they're all just the same.The only few positives I can identify here are actresses Iman Vellani and Brie Larson (Larson, who seems much more relaxed and settled into her superhero boots), and maybe the flashy action sequences. Otherwise, there's nothing here to watch, nothing here to experience and nothing here to enjoy. What a shame.","1,006 out of 1,424 found this helpful.

I just watched it on Disney+ now that it's available and it wasn't terrible at all.Sure, it was more childish at times (following the theme of the show that includes the same child main character), but over all it was just a more goofy, fun movie. And it still had some great fight scenes. I think edge lords have gotten so used to the dark grittiness of some of the movies and forgot how to just enjoy movies. I gave up on taking these movies seriously a long time ago. Yes, it's not up to the standard of the early MCU, but it's never going to get back to that - if you're going to compare sequels to the same standard as originals (in any genre) you're just asking for disappointment. If you've got Disney+, there's nothing to lose.","22 out of 37 found this helpful.

Were there flaws? Sure, but every film has them. It wasn't supposed to be Endgame or Infinty War. It served the purpose of being a tidy little piece of conjunctive tissue phases 4/5 have long needed. Was it fun and funny and little over the top? Sure but thank goodness it wasn't as dark and bleak as other film companies make when building out their superhero universes. Thank goodness for that I say. My largest challenge were equally two of my favorite things in the film. For those who don't watch Disney+ two (more actually) of the primary characters were unknown to theatre audiences. While a bit of help was given explaining the backstory of one, even less was given to the other (and her lovable family). I also found (again an issue derived from the streaming shows) Nick Fury's solitary leadership and different character (from his series) might have had the reverse effect for those who had watched Disney+. I have no way of knowing if this was a film where a committee overruled the film's Director or what happened in those areas. For what did work, I enjoyed a good deal. Somewhere in here was a much stronger film than we, the audience, were able to see. I realize much of the hate the film received came far before its theatrical debut as the usual crybabies who hate anything led with women or people of color were ready and waiting to review bomb the film no matter what loose ends might have been satisfactorily tied up. And for whatever reason the primary lead continues to draw their ire is ever a mystery to me. I enjoyed the performances of all of the cast. And even when the script was a wee bit wonky, it was still somewhat on track and eventually got where it needed to logically go.","24 out of 41 found this helpful.

It achieves that. If I had have seen this when I was twelve, it probably would have been my favourite MCU movie ever.I can see why a lot of people were unhappy with this one because it doesn't really do much beyond that, and there have been much better ones in the last few years. However, I think people are being a bit silly if they saw this movie and expected it to be anything other than a CGI heavy movie for 12-year-olds.For the most part, I do think this movie works, though. Pretty much all the jokes land, which hasn't always been a given in the MCU movies of the last five years or so. The action sequences are middle of the road, but you can follow what's happening and there's at least some kind of point to them.I don't think the CGI in this movie is quite as good as the CGI in Guardians of the Galaxy 3. However, it never looks cheap, either. I also feel like they probably should have just picked an aspect ratio and stuck with it because changing the aspect ratio in certain scenes didn't really add anything.

We honestly thought Eternals was bad, but that was only the beginning. It was only going to go downhill from there.Watching this movie felt like watching a beloved friend in a coma fighting for her life. It was sad, frustrating and ultimately hopeless. So much potential squandered right before our very eyes.Much has been said about the Girl Power aspect of this story, but it doesn't mean jack when the characters are so thinly written. After the big character tension build up between Carol and Monica, with the latter resenting her for not coming back, their fractures mend themselves very quickly. There is no chemistry between the the two at all.The villain is Bland with a capitol B, and highly forgettable.Nick Fury is actually pathetic in this movie. He doesn't at all act like the Fury we know and love. He was more in character in Far From Home when Talos was impersonating him!I don't think I've ever had this much of a bad experience with a film since Cats. And it is telling that there actually features a ludicrous scene involving baby flerkens and the song Memory.What the actual hell, Marvel?The only good thing is that it is mercifully short, and Iman Vellani does seem to be enjoying herself in the role.Once a great studio, brought crumbling down on itself. If I could give it zero stars, I would.","270 out of 397 found this helpful.

Nothing about this movie works. Although Brie Larson's acting has improved over the years it feels like she doesn't want to be there for this at all. Further, when you break it down, there is really no story at all happening. In fact, the solution to the entire problem is so extremely simple and solvable that you really wonder why there was a conflict in the first place. So much of everything is unexplained and eventually you stop trying to figure it out because you eventually lose all interest . Samuel L Jackson's character , Nick Fury, is hardly even a shell of his former self and is essentially now demoted to comedic relief.The scenes don't really mesh together at all. None of them are really necessary to advancing a plot and all feature the same repeated choreographic battle. The villain lacks any real charisma and is only provided a very brief backstory. Overall she never feels like too much of a threat.There's one part in particular that I think is absolutely a candidate for worst sequence of 2023. Without spoiling it , it is essentially a planet that looks like a cheap rip off of the Wizard of Oz. It just captures all of the problems with this movie into one scene. There's been a lot of less than stellar work from Marvel since endgame, but this is reaching new depths.I'm not even going to get started on the cats scene with the theme song....Please Loki, reset the entire timeline.","753 out of 1,143 found this helpful.

It never lost me.It has some good action scenes, although nothing that really stands out. The sci-fi candy is delicious. And it made me laugh out loud numerous times, with clever jokes that feel organic rather than forced.The other thing I really enjoyed is a few unique aspects that make it stand out amongst other formulaic superhero movies.

Today, I stumbled upon The Marvels, I thought ""Hey, I haven't been going to the theater this month that often, maybe I should try this out?"" And well, it seems that I'd made the wrong decision. The Marvels follows the titular Marvels trying to stop an evil Kree with one disadvantage however, every time they use their powers, it's Freaky Friday.Maybe its because of the very troubled production but everything just feels like an amalgamation of three separate movies, its like a ADHD experience. The movie does NOT take itself seriously at all, and as a result, it makes me hard to care for literally everything! Its like a circus act masquerading as a movie, it doesn't work! There were moments where characters were in danger and they start joking about it every opportunity they get. To add insult to injury was the treatment of the character of Nick Fury, who feels like a completely different character altogether, cracking lame after lame jokes every single time! Special effects were decent, but considering the massive 271M+ budget I wished they could've at least cared about the plot and flesh out some if the characters and their motivations instead of relying on action scene after action scene, it gets tiring after a while you know?Brie Larson herself looks tired and forced in this movie, her character also being this girl-boss who can sweep through enemies in this movie, no weaknesses and no vulnerabilities. It all feels so one-dimensional, it tries to be like a 80s action star with the likes of Arnold and co. But fails because they lack charisma and charm. Because of this I found it impossible to relate to her in any sense of way. Monica Rambeau wasn't trying her best here, and there is no opposing dynamic between the two to the point where I found her virtually indistinguishable from Mrs. Danvers herself. However I do commend Iman Vellani's Kamala Khan, whose child-like personality I was comfortable with and is the standout between the three leads but suffers from being very underwritten and the villain is a copy-and-paste from dozens we've seen before.Overall, a messy and disjointed movie with not much to offer rather than annoying, dreadful humor and some few flashy action scenes. It certainly feels like homework for the MCU as it struggles to keep a hook in something after the Infinity Saga. Skip this one and play with your action figures instead, Im sure it'll be better than this.","296 out of 462 found this helpful.

It's like they couldn't figure out what direction to go, so they made 4 versions, and blended them together. Which would explain the high budget, the 5 delays, and the reshoots. Kamala's character was probably the best part of the movie. I promise you, the script did her no favors, but she stood out. Her acting was in line with her character. This was probably an exciting opportunity for her, and she wasn't going to let a bad script, and production problems stop her from giving a great effort. However, the story, the dialogue, the musical gimmick, the weak villain. It just didn't work. I don't think the blame lies solely with the actors, or even the director, who did lack the experience for helming a movie with a budget this size. I think Disney interfered heavily with the production, which almost always yields bad results. I think it was doomed to fail. They put so much pressure on this being successful, they forgot to make it coherent, unique, or interesting.","375 out of 602 found this helpful.

I personally have enjoyed Brie Larson's portrayal of the character and enjoyed the first film for the most part. Hearing that her story was shifting to include two other Marvel heroes as co-leads had me raising an eyebrow, but I'm always open to things changing. My biggest concern about The Marvels before seeing it was the fact that two series' on Disney+ seemed to be a prerequisite first. I've been following the entire franchise from start to finish (including the shows), and I really liked the character of Ms. Marvel, so I found myself excited. I can see how viewers who haven't followed the shows would be turned off though, which is a real problem this franchise is facing at the moment. Let's dive deeper, but also review this film on its own, which I did have a good time with.The Marvels picks up after the events of Captain Marvel, Wandavision, and Ms. Marvel. At a mere hour and 45 minutes, the film jumps right into it. The three of them begin to switch places after being exposed to energy. They quickly have to learn to work as a team to stop a looming threat. The Kree are back, led by Dar Benn (Zawe Ashton), and her motivations are all because of a storyline that feels forced to include Captain Marvel and something she did in the past. This was easily the worst part of the film, as I was completely uninterested in it. Her power stems from a Bengal, which Ms. Marvel has the other half of and that was far more interesting. Sadly, the villain as a whole just felt like a device instead of a fleshed-out character. The villain almost hurt the film a little too much for me, but the trio of actresses here was a joy to watch.Brie Larson, Iman Vellani, and Teyonah Parris are absolutely stellar as a trio working together. Their chemistry was so much fun to watch. It's easily the reason I'm giving the villain storyline a pass and saying I enjoyed the movie. The majority of the movie is about them learning to use their powers together and I couldn't get enough of it honestly. On top of that, the integration of Kamala Khan's family was hilarious and used perfectly. I also enjoyed the subtle, quiet moments where they share heart-to-hearts with one another. Certain conversations between Carol and Monica actually had me tearing up. The subtle touches here and there were very nice. The action is surprisingly fun to watch and the CGI didn't stand out as much as it did to me in the first Captain Marvel film, but yes, the elephant in the room here is that this film isn't accessible to everyone, which is a real shame.This is the part that bothers me to even have to mention, but here we go. From Iron Man to Avengers: Endgame, there was always a plan and it was only a couple of movies a year to follow. I'm someone who chooses to follow everything, even if it's good or bad because I would like to see where everything eventually builds to. I can sense another finale in the coming years, but they are simply making far too many projects for the average viewer to follow. I fear that Avengers movies won't even draw the crowds they used to once they finally come out. This frustrates me because the majority of the projects are still good for the most part. It's just that there's too much and far too many characters. This is coming from someone who likes or loves a lot of the newest characters, so I can only imagine how fans who have fallen off the franchise are feeling. Anyways, we're here to discuss The Marvels.In the end, The Marvels is a solid popcorn flick that I sat back and had a good time with. If the cast didn't work so well together and the humour didn't work for me, I would be calling this a lacklustre movie all around. Nia DaCosta definitely pulled the best performances she could out of these actresses and I commend her for that. I also just have to say that the standout of this film is Iman Vellani. I loved her in Ms. Marvel and she shines again here. She's just so happy to be a part of this franchise and it really shows. There are certain scenes that will annoy viewers, but honestly, I recommend this one to fans of the MCU, unless you're someone who already dislikes any of these characters/actresses. Otherwise, it's not great by any means, but I had a good time and I think others will too.","203 out of 459 found this helpful.

Both of the other two feel mishandled and don't deliver performances as strong as we know they are able to. The action scenes feel largely inserted rather than organic, though some do get creative and fun, such as the use of body swapping. The comedy is not as funny as that of the two Disney+ shows it follows up on - not by a long shot. The cinematography and editing have some inspired moments, especially in a few montages, one of which made me laugh harder than I have in a very long time, and is otherwise mired in the restrictive house style.This is a great feminist piece, though it is not up to the standard of the Birds of Prey film, or ones like The Babadook and 2003's Monster. It is very clear that this movie's three writers, all of them women, made sure to work in as many stereotypically female things as they could, and a lot of the best moments are when this really leans into that. I want to live on the planet where everyone sings instead of talks. There's kittens, double dutch, girls teasing each other about the boyfriend of one of them. I know some men won't like this, though to be clear not everyone who's going to hate this is a misogynist, but, seriously, fellow fellas, we can support the girls getting some representation, especially when it's this good. Where the first Captain Marvel solo pic was very much a typical western(the part of the world *and* the fiction genre) power fantasy of an individual handling things entirely on their own, this features several diverse young women supporting each other, reflecting younger generations' move away from individualism, towards found family and looking out for one another.I recommend this to every fan of the MCU - note that this could be the first one you watch. 7/10.","216 out of 494 found this helpful.

But they utterly failed. Feige pulled off ""wait until the post credit scene to get excited cuz the film itself is boring"" trick again. And it wasn't a ""wow"" for me at least. The theatre was silent throughout and after the film. No one even made a giggling sound. Dead silence. Jokes were landing facedown to the ground every time a character made one. That's right.

It usually has to be really good - or really, REALLY bad. Then there are the times when the rating is so far off the mark that it really gets my gall. The current rating for this MCU outing is one of those times...Before embarking on this super hero adventure, I watched Ms Marvel to help better understand one of The Marvels' main characters. So glad I did! Not only did it clarify who's who, the 6 part mini series was some of the best entertainment I've enjoyed of late. Ironically, I was 'driven' to rate it for the same reason I'm rating this as well.Rather than bore you with a deep dive into the cinematic MCU's inability to correctly capture the spirit of the original comics (I never read them), or try to show off with an analysis of racial stereotyping and Hollywood's failure to address it (give me a break), I will tell you this about The Marvels: IT'S A LOT OF FUN!!!The story is good.The acting is good.The special effects are FANTASTIC.It really is top-notch entertainment for the whole family.I never spoil, so I have to be careful with my formulation when discussing a scene about three quarters of the way into the film... Let's just say that it stems from a familiar 'cat' on the space station - and that it managed to provoke a genuine belly laugh from me.Don't listen to the haters! This is a top MCU instalment that shouldn't be missed.","41 out of 69 found this helpful.

It is a film so bad that it makes previous Marvel films like Eternals and Thor: Love and Thunder look like masterpieces. The film is a complete and utter failure on every level, from its story to its characters to its action.The story of The Marvels is a nonsensical mess. It is a convoluted and confusing plot that is full of holes. The film tries to do too much, and it ends up doing nothing well. The characters are all underdeveloped and unlikable. Carol Danvers is a bland and boring protagonist. Monica Rambeau is a whiny and annoying sidekick. And Kamala Khan is a cringe-inducing caricature of a teenage fangirl.The action in The Marvels is uninspired and generic. There are no memorable fight scenes, and the CGI is often laughable. The film's climax is a particularly embarrassing sequence that is both visually unimpressive and emotionally empty.Overall, The Marvels is a terrible film. It is a soulless and lifeless corporate product that is devoid of any creativity or passion. It is a film that is so bad that it is actually offensive.","55 out of 114 found this helpful.

The plot revolves around Captain Marvel's mistake in choosing sides during a battle, disrupting the cosmic balance. Two young ladies gain powers in the process, and Captain Marvel must collaborate with them to rectify her error and restore equilibrium to the universe.Directed by Nia DaCosta (Candyman) and featuring Brie Larson (Lessons in Chemistry), Teyonah Parris (Dear White People), Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel), Samuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction), and Zawe Ashton (Blitz).This film boasts clean and classic Marvel-style characters, cinematography, action scenes, and special effects. However, the plot seems somewhat lackluster, with Captain Marvel possibly appearing more as a villain than a hero. The backstories of the heroes lack sufficient development, making it challenging to form a connection with them. The cat steals the show initially but feels overdone by the end, and even Samuel L. Jackson's wit falls short of expectations.In summary, this superhero movie prioritizes its message over a compelling storyline. While the characters and visuals are in line with Marvel's trademark style, the plot may leave audiences indifferent. The lack of character depth and an engaging storyline earns this film a 3/10, making it a skip-worthy experience.","305 out of 516 found this helpful.

I could have saw an entire movie with her. I felt I could have used more of Monica Rambeau seeing that out of the three this is the first real showcasing of her power (but I'm bias on that), and ofcourse Sam L. Jackson as Fury was fantastic.One problem that I had with this movie that I also had with Captain Marvel is that it did not feel big enough to be a Marvel Movie, it felt closer to one of the Disney Plus shows.But overall i had a blast and thankfully it was not a long ride.

It is funny, the viewers who have some sort of spiritual connection with the Marvel Universe and expected this movie to be totally serious were universally disappointed. Some give the movie silly ratings of ""1"" or ""2"" which of course is totally absurd and an insult to the hundreds of craftsmen and technicians who formed this movie is post-production and created the fantastic sound and visuals.At the other end of the spectrum are folks like my wife and me, plain old 70-something retirees, who just look for an entertaining 90 minutes or so. The viewers who align with this outlook write positive reviews and give the movie a decent rating. No, probably not ""10"", but maybe 6, 7, or 8 when you compare it to other action movies with a humorous approach.I won't mention specifics of the storyline here except it has Brie Larson as Captain Marvel and three other powerful young women who fight physically and psychologically for the fate of the universe. When the movie ended my wife said, ""I liked the scenes with the cats."" Yes, they are very special cats (and kittens).Part of what makes this such an entertaining movie are the quiet scenes when the characters get to converse with each other, and the families. Plus, for those of us with a well-equipped home theater sound system, which includes a good powered subwoofer, this movie has a great sound track with body-shaking bass during battle scenes.Entertaining movie!

What I got was a charming if unexceptional narrative; nothing about the storyline is so jarringly out of place as to snap my immersion, none of the comedy so corny that made me cringe in embarrassment. All three women are at peak performance, and have great chemistry with one another, making for endearing characters. So what's the problem?Though I'm finding the complaints of ""frantic pacing"" to be overblown, the story beats do play out one after the other, giving these characters only the minimal amount of breathing room to really gel with one another. The consequences of an apparent disastrous event for a set of characters is barely acknowledged, and the solution to their plight -a plight that is the catalyst to the entire movie- is solved in about 45 seconds. We neither see nor hear of these characters or them for the rest of the film. This will become a problem for the rest of the movie; minor conflicts are introduced and ""solved"" so quickly they feel barely worth bringing up at all. What I felt should have been the emotional core of the entire story effectively solves itself in one of the least engaging ways imaginable, and as before, never brought up again. The warmth the actresses bring to these characters and their rapport with one another make it all the more frustrating when the film barely allows them to expand on these situations in any real significant way before it's time to get back to ""comic book movie"".That's the biggest problem, in my assessment. The actors are good, and their characters charming. The comedy is for the most part witty and brisk (there's no screaming goat running gag). It's good enough.But after a decade and 33 movies, is ""good enough"" good enough?","42 out of 98 found this helpful.

Nothing makes sense, NOTHING. And that's the first 45 minutes before I had enough and left the theater and demanded a refund. I can't believe this script got a greenlight, let alone a $300 million budget. Speaking of which, where on this earth did all that money go? It certainly is not up on the screen as this is some of the worst CGI I have ever seen. Movies made in the 90s look a thousand times better than this catastrophe. I keep reading articles about why this movie is going to fail and they all got it wrong; three incomprehensibly unlikable leads, a nonsensical script, and a woefully incompetent director are why this movie is such a failure.

It pulled their arcs together like a crossover comic and continued all three of them beautifully. From characters facing concequences for pervious actions to follow up on emotional points. And the three leads play off each other so well. I had a fantastic time with this movie. To me it was fun, comic book whacky, with a lot heart and certainly made me emotional.

The shorter run time helps a lot more than it hinders and it's just a really funny, wacky cosmic adventure that manages to be a contained story whilst still setting up exciting things for the future.Brie Larson is great, given so much more to work with this time so Carol has more personality and greater depth. She's still as funny as before but more remorseful, dealing with both the legacy and fallout of her actions as a soldier as well as feeling guilt over not spending as much time on Earth as she should've.Teyonah Parris gets the majority of the exposition yet still makes Monica a fully fledged character again. There's an initial unease at being reunited with Carol in these circumstances whilst still dealing with everything post blip that she's so good at conveying.Iman Vellani is the best though, improving everything with her presence. The enthusiasm she has for simply being in this world remains so genuine and as she's finally meeting her idol there's so much fun to be had when she's constantly freaking out. There's plenty of emotional heft too as she sees first-hand the sacrifice required to be a hero.Samuel L. Jackson is back to his fun loving version of Fury which feels like a huge apology for Secret Invasion. Zawe Ashton is another one-note MCU villain who has fun chewing scenery with some solid motivation until the third act betrays it all for a big CGI fight that doesn't make sense for the character.Nia DaCosta's direction isn't entirely free of studio intervention or feeling occasionally voiceless but this is still some of the strongest direction recently, helped by the body swapping antics of the plot which means the action sequences have a unique selling point for this one.The MCU has serious ongoing issues with its use of CGI and there's no doubt there's some weak points here (with a likely chance the team was massively overworked). However, the film generally looks pretty good in that department and the added time thanks to a later release date clearly helped a lot.","75 out of 188 found this helpful.

MARVEL (Iman Vellani, who's origin story is told in the DisnePlus TV Series MS. MARVEL but who's story is summed pretty quickly - and pretty well - here). They join forces to fight a villain, Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton) intent on inflicting revenge/punishment on Captain Marvel. Also along for the ride is good ol' Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury (in his 15th appearance in an MCU vehicle). They all bounce around the scenarios with a winking knowledge - and earnestness - about what kind of movie they are making...and with which what tone they need to hit.In the hands of Director Nia DaCosta (the 2020 remake of CANDYMAN), THE MARVELS moves along at a brisk pace, injecting some humor and decent (enough) action sequences and CGI mixed in with a clever segment or 2 (one scene set to a classic Musical Theater song is worth the price of admission in and of itself). There is enough light, breezy sequences and banter that the main word that comes out of this film is ""fun"". DaCosta succeeds, very well, with fun in this film. Where she doesn't succeed as well is in emotional heft. Captain Marvel is given a few ""self reflective"" moments and while Larson is a terrific actor and tries to succeed with these moments, they didn't feel earned, so they fell flat. Unfortunately, the other characters are there to battle and throw off one-liners...and not much more.Wisely, DaCosta limits this film to 1 hours and 45 minutes - the shortest MCU film to date - and this is a positive for she just ""gets to it"" and doesn't linger on any of the moments that don't work or would fall apart if anyone had anytime to think about them.And, of course, the ""extra scenes"" (an MCU staple) set up 2 new franchises, so you want to stick around for them (but you don't need to stick around to the end of the credits).All-in-all - Ms. Marvel is a fun, lightweight romp that will entertain for the time you are in the cineplex. But not much more. But...isn't that what going to the movies is all about?Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","57 out of 142 found this helpful.

Originally, I was just going to wait for its home release on Disney Plus, but after recently rewatching WandaVision, I genuinely wanted to see how they would handle Monica Rambeau and see what they would do with her.So I'll mention the positives for this film first...The movie is actually pretty, I really enjoyed the film aesthetically it looked good. This is very surprising to say as recent Marvel projects are tremendous eye sores.The films central characters, Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), were surprisingly good. I had fully anticipated to dislike Captain Marvel and Ms Marvel in this film but I surprisingly enjoyed them both which is a big compliment coming from me, and Monica Rambeau is my favorite of the three she was good as I expected and anticipated. All three actresses gave enjoyable performances, and they all worked well together on screen.Then, of course, Samuel Jackson is always great! And the return of everyone's favorite Flerken kitty Goose. She had a great sequence that I refuse to spoil, but it had me dying. Goose saved this film!And well that's it...This film is just bad. Bad writing, bad pacing, bad storytelling. Nothing in this film is properly set up as it rushes through its 1 hour and 45 minute run time. Which is quite frankly fine for me as I genuinely did not want more of this.This movie as a whole is just overwhelmingly safe. It has no stakes, takes no risks, and does nothing. But there is actual enjoyment in its failings. It was so bad that it was good. The amount of eye rolling, face palms, and sighs I gave through this film was astonishing. I gave up on this film within the first 30 minutes, and afterward, that's when the enjoyment began because of how bad it went on to be.Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the film became a musical? Like what is happening? This film is so chaotic and unstructured. It just never stopped.The film had a good mid-credit scene so you know stay for that. Unfortunately, it was spoiled for me, so it didn't hit as hard as it could have. Especially if you're a fan of the actor who originally played the character the scene introduces.But The Marvels was exactly what I anticipated it to be, a below average dump. Which is a shame because they play with some interesting concepts in this film, but they do nothing with them, or they are just poorly handled. I can at least say I didn't hate this movie. Unfortunately, I just enjoyed it for all the wrong reasons.IMDb: 3/10

Special effects and extremely funny scenes (hopefully on purpose) saves what could be considered a somewhat mundane storyline.

And Monica Rambeau is fantastic here as well. I liked what they did with her story with Carol here as well as how they've showed off her new power set.Finally, the action sequences were a lot of fun and well crafted. The one glaring issue with this movie is the villain. She's the weakest part of the film and is your typical run of the mill superhero movie villain.

"7","/10","A Marvel Of Action, Comedy, and Fast Pace. Editing Makes This Movie Feel Incomplete","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9426248/?ref_=tt_urv","rgkarim","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25226117/?ref_=tt_urv","10 November 2023","LIKES:Fast Pace
-This is not some convoluted tale, this is a very big focus on essentially entertainment, action, and fun.-The Marvels puts the petal down to the floor and keeps that pace going to keep your mind entertained with very little downtime.-It amplifies the action, supports the comedy, and keeps the theme of fun without getting too lost in Eternals like drama, which may be a plus for many given some of the dryer pieces on the TV.-Thus, those wanting just that escapism, get this for the most part.Funny, to a Degree:
-The movie tries to be one point back to the 90s feel of the first Captain Marvel, while also trying out some new things that bring Ms. Marvel.-It worked for me. There were some really funny moments that had me in stitches. Primarily Nick Fury and Kamala's parents were the ones making me laugh, but I appreciated the effort and some mix-ups the movie did.-Plus, the writing accomplishes some well-time lines to be entertaining and representative of the characters they built from the previous series.-Plus, for those that love the current trend of stuffing a lot of jokes into a short time, this is a plus and a like for you as well.The Acting:
-Certainly not award winning, ground breaking, or even top caliber for the Marvel Universe, this cast still has some shine to it.-Jackson's role might be sillier and less of the grit and grime I like, but the man's turn of phrase and looks still make me laugh and what he accomplished with this role.-Vellani does her job well as the ever enthusiastic Khan, a fan girl at heart with a lot of that pep and obsession that we see in the comics. She's light, airy, total fangirling, and yet surprisingly deep when she needs to be. Certainly the sore thumb to the rest of the cast's dynamic, she achieves much in bridging a lot of things to come.-Parris' role is much like her Wandavision, feeling one part drama, one part comedy, and one part invigorating. She's got a decent grasp on the character's trauma, and delivers her lines well with fortitude, edge, but yet never going too far. I really liked her chemistry with so many characters.-Larson is intense as ever, really diving into the extremes and keeping that chilling face of stone cold passive force. Yet, the woman did dive into some comedy and I was pleased with some of the things she accomplished in her action hero role. Most notably about the second half of the movie when she hit her stride, this was better for me than her previous roles.The Story Elements, a Little
-The movie has some pockets of character drawing and actual ethical components that strike hard and paint the superhero world again in shades of grey.-Danvers and Rambeau's stories hold a bit more punch, some relevance to me making it surprisingly complex, and giving us that relief from the silly storms of stuttering and speaking that this movie is loaded with.-Khan's story holds touching moments as well, which as a bridge really help add some moral lessons that might go well with an extreme fan to learn.-Surprisingly, even the villain's motifs have some surprises and perhaps the most impressive thing about them, so that's a plus as well.The Mid-Credit Scene
-It's the only scene so you can leave afterwards if you want.-However, it really helps with the excitement factor for many and showing the next steps coming to help straighten out the rumors of the mess that is Marvel.-I won't say more, but this was one of the better end credit scenes that sort of felt like the original three phases.The Action:
-The Marvels' fighting moments finally start feeling like we have someone who understands a superhero movie fighting elements.-There are about three noteworthy fights I will call them, and these held the energy, pizazz, and character that movies like the Avengers, Winter Soldier, Guardians 1 and 3, and Shang Chi held.-A tad trending into stiff choreography at times, the movie fortunately uses the fast pace to really unload that comic book feel.-Diversity settles in that though there is a common fight element, the scenery and the amount of things happening freshens it up a bit and make it really fun.-And that first battle, was probably the one that showed the most promise and was the peak, though the others aren't bad, but for a few things I'll mention soon.-Overall, this action element was very pleasing to me.DISLIKES:The Villain Is Forgettable:
-I agree with other reviewers I have read, the main antagonist is quite honestly one of the lesser villains I have cared about in a very long time.-Dar-Benn's plot is stronger than her character, lacking any real development, unique aspects, or even those memorable moments outside of some cool fashion, one notable speech, and her piercing eyes.-Her origin story is simplistically boring and lasts less than thirty seconds, and any attempt to connect with her crew or rivalry, shockingly limited and lacking compared to others.-I held no connection or suspenseful purpose to her and felt she was an accessory given everything in this movie. The actress did a fine job, but not even her skills could save her character from the chief flaw of this movie.Too Much Comedy?-It depends on your tolerance and like and style for this to be a dislike.-I love a good comedy that balances and delivers those lines perfectly and has a variety, which this does several times for me.-Yet, the movie is a bit too dependent on the jokes, a lot of banter, nicknames, lines, and an aggressively comedic style that is too much for viewers like me.-Khan's character can be super annoying, and her chatter grates my nerves before they had her try a new approach. While even her parents excessive judgement got a bit looser and haphazard that didn't work for me.-Too many puns, an odd joke with singing feeling out of place, and even some dark comedy that feels out of sorts, the direction for this movie may have needed some fine tuning to match some of my other favorite movies.The Visual Effects:
-At times, they are amazing with what they have come up with to make this comic book come to life with the effects they do.-Plasma bolts pop, punches and walls break, and there is color all around that is super exciting and that dazzle I love for the theater.-And then there are times where the effects look weak, forced, and editing has led to bad blends, stiff movements, and very cheesy looks that mirror a cel-shaded video game.-It's minor dislike at most times, but something I do agree that it's not their cleanest work.The Editing/Adaptations:
-The rumors state there was a lot of editing and I felt I could really see it in this film that hindered more than helped it.-The Marvels has a lot of awkward and unimpressive elements that really tore into the experience they were hinting at in the first set of trailers.-while the edits give you that fast paced, escaping into a lot of fun and comedic moments, it really tore up the story, character involvement, and action in the grand scheme of things.-The origin stories and connecting points are forgettable, blink and you'll miss it moments, lacking that Marvel polish.-Obstacles that start as a set-up of being tough to crack are surprisingly easy to get over, and even the darker morale questions feel tagged on and bland.-One whole segment of the movie on a planet with water felt incredibly rushed, so much depth gone with very obvious transition struggles and an action scene that felt even more rushed than most.-And as for the other action moments, I feel these two lost some edge and suspense, perhaps even style from how much was left out, all too cram so much into this movie that feels like a launch point/wrap up/media launcher.-This dislike I feel is the worst part of this movie, for while it works to keep entertainment, the movie does take some serious hits in a complete story on its own and one that feels every element is needed.-Throw in that I feel Khan's story got chopped up enough, that the Marvels now feels like more Captain Marvel 2 is the better title.The VERDICT
The hate for this movie is a bit stronger than I think needed after seeing the film. While certainly not my favorite to come out of the gate, The Marvels holds a lot more to in terms of fun, fandom, and that entertainment complex than several other MCU adventures have been. I enjoyed the fast pace for the feel and drive, helping keep the comedy good, the plot moving, and the action having that superhero slam that the original phases mostly held for me. It's just a good time, and one that does not rely too much on the proceeding movies to enjoy, so you don't have to wait too much given they fill in the gaps. It's purely going to be mind-numbing entertainment and mostly escapes some of the other themes Marvel got caught up on. Yet, the movie's cuts, while entertaining, really did a number on the movie feeling entirely about the Marvels. Origin stories are highly reduced, impasses are surprisingly easy to get through, lots of shifting around to try to keep all pieces in the movie, an entire section feeling very rushed, and action that feels too short are all things that really feel incomplete to me. A director's cut is certainly needed for fans like me who want all these things extended upon, especially the forgettable villain that has promise, but just gets lost to the comedy and time constraints of this movie. Still, it's not the horrible piece others call it to be for me, but yet feels like there is still some organizational needs to helping get them back on track.My scores are:
Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 7.5-8.0
Movie overall: 6.5-7.0.","30 out of 72 found this helpful.

Well this gets a bit complicated. Marvel movies were all connected since the beginning which is the reason so many loved Marvel, yet they have pushed this concept too far. But what do I really think about this movie?Many movies including this one, Fast X or the upcoming Aquaman 2, have the same antagonist motivation: Revenge. It's BORING Marvel, it's BORING Universal, it's BORING DC/WB. However, they somehow still don't get it.On the other hand, The Marvels is a true masterpiece in terms of fun and cuteness. To see Gosse eating people or Kamala Kahn being a fan girl just warms up my heart. Additionally, it seems like Marvel gave the VFX artists some space to breath because the VFX aren't that bad.

And, frankly, that would have probably made for a better movie. Writer-director Nia DaCosta's third feature outing and the latest in the Marvel Universe paradigm is a wildly inconsistent superhero movie that tries too hard to do too much and doesn't have a script to support it. Too many of its plot elements aren't adequately explained until well into the story, while others aren't explained at all, leaving viewers who aren't comic book laureates wondering what's going on (particularly at film's end). Meanwhile, other narrative aspects frequently appear gimmicky and grow old quickly, such as the introduction of the primary superpower that its three protagonists share, one that almost becomes slapstickish after an all-too-brief while. On top of that, the CGI effects vacillate from one end of the quality spectrum to the other, creating a mix of images that are either startling to look at or stunningly cheesy at best. Add to that a villain that isn't particularly menacing, along with attempts at humor that either succeed brilliantly (cat lovers take note) or fall flat and look incredibly lame (as aficionados of musical theater will undoubtedly attest), all of which further add to the picture's pervasive inconsistency. The inclusion of ample clues for advancing the overarching Marvel Universe storyline continues here, too, furthering a trend that's growing tiresome in the studio's releases, a development akin to the ""Paul is dead"" legacy come to life with every passing picture. Then there's the trio of heroes themselves, who often appear more like they've been plucked from a giddy slumber party flick or a Cyndi Lauper video than taking center stage as seriously empowered champions in an action-adventure offering. All of these failings combine to make this production more of a forgettable placeholder in the Marvel mythology than a standalone feature (not to mention a pale substitute for a sequel to the far-superior film that launched the Captain Marvel franchise in 2019). In short, ""The Marvels"" is as much of a mess as it is a movie, and that's troubling for several reasons. It lends credence to the growing criticism that films like this aren't to be taken seriously. It reinforces the notion that they're cookie-cutter in nature, easily interchangeable with one another. And it raises questions about the career choices of lead actress Brie Larson, who, though quite capable of playing roles like these, is running the risk of becoming type-cast, a troubling prospect for an Academy Award-winning actress who possesses a depth of talent and is handily adept at taking on better and more serious material than this. In the wake of this release, Marvel Studios should take a step back and seriously assess where its future is headed, especially if movies like this are any indication. As pictures like ""Wakanda Forever"" (2022) show, the studio is capable of better work - and it's time to show viewers that.","174 out of 323 found this helpful.

Trailers usually are put together by marketing to make a film look as good as possible but I think in the case of this film they could not hide how utterly awful this film would be. I don't believe in criticizing a film if I do r see it so I went expecting the worst with the desire to at least be entertained. This was the worst 105 minutes I have spent in a movie theater in a long time. The MCU has gone from being a franchise that had so e great films but mostly solid, reliable and memorable films. Since Avengers: Endgame, only with a couple of exceptions, the MCU has gone completely downhill. With every film, they feel so generic, so done without the care that used to be made them so popular. Now, the difference is like night and day. They have become aggressively lazy and average films. Forgettable. But none of them had been complete failures on every level until The Marvels.There really is no story to talk about here. It is a sequel to Captain Marvel that i admit is one of the pre-Endgame films I liked the least. I didn't think Brie Larson was particularly bad as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel but there was nothing special about her in the role. Here it's obvious she wasn't right for the role. She has no charisma as the character, it felt like she was phoning in the performance. In fact that is the case for everyone in this film. It's a phoned in film. There is not a single character or situation to care about. A villain that is probably the worst ever in the MCU. It's just a series of mediocre action scenes put together with so e exposition dialogue thrown in to pad the runtime. At 105 mi it's it's short by MCU standards but it felt like 3 hours!!!Hands down, the worst MCU film ever!!!Grade: F.","157 out of 293 found this helpful.

But too be honest I never got bored, and had to smile once and a while. So in current wave of the MCU, which has been disappointing so far, this one was a relief.

It's getting a bad rap seemingly because superhero fatigue is settling in, as it's really no worse than (or all that different to) any of the other lesser - yet still enjoyable - entries in its wider series. Its poor box-office performance isn't really anything to do with the movie itself, as the weak marketing campaign has meant that a lot of people just don't seem know it's actually out and those who do would rather catch it on Disney+ when it inevitably drops there in a couple of months. Speaking of the soon-to-be-more-expensive streaming service, the picture does kind of feel like something that ought to have premiered straight on the small screen. It's not that it's bad, but rather that something seems ever-so-slightly off about the whole endeavour. The narrative never quite gels together into something truly cohesive or, indeed, essential. The parts are all there and the A-to-B-to-C of it all lines up perfectly fine, but a lot of it feels like it's retreading old ground and the newer elements don't really get all that much time to shine (for example, some scenes play out like the culminations to character arcs that just aren't in the film). However, despite its legitimate rough patches and a general haziness that gets all the more prevalent in retrospect, the picture is quite a bit of throwaway fun once it gets going. This is mainly thanks to the compelling central concept that sees the three heroes switch places whenever two or more of them try to use their powers at the same time. This leads to a couple of really entertaining action sequences that are impressively choreographed and consistently kinetic, with the first major switching fight being the highlight of the entire affair. The other major reason the piece works as well as it does is Iman Vellani, whose Kamala Kahn is an absolute delight whenever she's on screen. The enthusiasm of the character seems to stem from the genuine enthusiasm of the actor; this energy seeps out of the screen and straight into your heart, putting a smile on your face whenever Ms. Marvel gets a moment in the spotlight. The other two leads, Brie Larson's Captain Marvel and Teyonah Parris' Professor Marvel (?), are both solid as well, don't get me wrong, and the supportive dynamic between the three main characters holds the story aloft even in its weaker moments. The youngest of the trio is clearly the most endearing, though, and I kind of wish the piece had focused more on her as a proper sequel to her series. The villain is very weak and some elements of her plan don't quite line up, but she does what she needs to and acts as a formidable foe for the good guys without threatening to steal a single scene from them. The other side characters, including Kamala's family and Nick Fury, are as enjoyable as they've ever been and raise the quality of what could have been a fairly weak B-plot (as does a certain cat-like creature). Ultimately, this really isn't a bad effort. It's perfectly serviceable popcorn entertainment that's competently constructed from familiar materials (even if it lacks the style of some of director Nia DaCosta's other work). It's as fun as it is forgettable, an enjoyable - if undeniably minor - entry in an ever-expanding cinematic universe. It's pretty good, and it's certainly better than you may expect given its generally poor reception.","18 out of 42 found this helpful.

Sure, she's overpowered and a bit cocky, but I like her. I was excited but was also equally prepared for ""Ant-Man: Quantumania"" crapfest. The movie has its flaws, but it's undeniably entertaining-I left with a smile on my face. If you watch in a happy mood you'll enjoy it, but if you go in with prejudice or wanting to hate it or be disappointed then you might. Despite its flaws, I won't argue that there aren't any, but I'll disagree with anyone who says it's not fun.So, I can list all the positives about this movie in a single paragraph, and I do have quite a few criticisms that I'll get into later. But, no matter what I end up saying, the movie is just plain fun-it's an enjoyable experience. I wasn't bored or disinterested at any point; I didn't feel the urge to check my phone for messages or anything. I was thoroughly entertained and had a good time. The criticisms only came to mind after a good night's sleep when I had the chance to reflect, but even with all that, I genuinely enjoyed it.Captain Marvel's got cocky attitude, but she's undeniably strong so she backs it up, i mean she went toe to toe with Thanos🤷‍♂️. I also don't think she was as cocky as usual here. Nick Fury's reaction to seeing Ms. Marvel for the first time was just perfect, chefs kiss. It's great to see him back to being the cool and badass character after the disappointing Secret Wars series. The action was cool, with really enjoyable fight sequences, I was hooked throughout. And let's talk about the havoc they wreaked on Kamala's house; it brings home the idea that if superheroes were real, we'd probably hate them, and so would insurance companies lol.I was curious about the vibes it would bring since Ms. Marvel, Captain Marvel, and Monica all bring different auras to the screen. It got me wondering how they would interact, Ms. Marvel and Captain Marvel appeared destined to cross paths, and Captain Marvel's connection with her niece, Monica, made sense. It looks like Carol was meant to bridge the gap between Kamala and my Monica, I guess. Iman Vellani's liveliness stole the show.Watching it on IMAX felt pretty epic, felt immersive but I had some issues with the green screen, particularly in the space scenes where the background felt a bit too empty at times. I get that space is vast emptiness, a little more detail could be nice. The graphics were generally good, although there were moments when they fell a bit short.Not a fan of the time jumps. I don't think the recap was necessary, but not everyone watches all the movies and series, so maybe need a little memory jog.I was okay with gender-swapping villain as I'm not a comic book fan. However, Dar-Benn didn't get enough time for proper development; the bare minimum with ""the annihilator"" backstory. It made sense, but we needed more time with her before the events of the movie unfolded. One of my favorite MCU movies is ""Age of Ultron"" because they introduced and defeated Ultron in the same film, and it felt complete story arc. In Dar-Benn's case, it felt rushed, leaving us without the chance to care, fear, or learn about her and her powers-just a brief explanation of her motives.I'm know Captain Marvel is incredibly strong and quick, which is why I like her. I'm a fan of ""overpowered"" superheroes, hence DC characters; but the way she just pops up out of nowhere was insane. Like did you fly here that quick?? And when did she and Tessa Thompson's character become such close friends?? I thought I'd hate the singing planet part, but it wasn't bad; didn't enjoy it, didn't hate it either.I was confused about how they got 'untangled'. Maybe I missed something, but I don't think it was properly explained. It also felt quite unrealistic that, out of everyone in the MCU, only these three characters had light powers. I would have expected more characters to be entangled, but I guess that might have complicated things.It felt longer than it actually was, but in a good way, like the runtime was filled and the movie didn't drag. But it also felt like some parts of the plot were simply missing.There was excessive hugging, i didn't care them by the last two or so. Also they just moved into Monica's house? I really love the credit scene and what it sets up for the future, However people complain movies these days are just set ups for others. I don't think this movie did that too unnaturally. Only the ending.First movie in a while that's made me feel like superhero fatigue may not be a thing, other than GOTG 3. Like Loki s2 is currently making me feel like there's superhero burnout.I believe the chemistry between the characters could have been portrayed better, but I don't necessarily see it as a flaw from this particular movie, more like an issue with the movies/shows that preceded it. As mentioned earlier, the fan-girling between Ms. Marvel and Captain Marvel makes sense. But, the connection between Aunt Carol and Monica, despite knowing the backstory, didn't quite hit the emotional chords. That emotional aspect, is what the movie was missing in general.I think with so many movies and shows, plus significant gaps between a movie and its sequel, there's a risk of losing the emotional connection between the two. The time span from ""Captain Marvel"" to ""The Marvels"" is quite extensive. Nowadays, Marvel movies seem more focused on connecting superheroes' stories rather than emphasizing the emotional connections. It's all about how the multiverse links up and how many characters can be packed into a movie to showcase a unified world. It's fun at times but feels unnecessary at others. I don't see it as a flaw specific to ""The Marvels"" movie; it seems more like an overarching issue within the MCU. Reminds me of diseconomies of scale lol. I wonder if Star Wars franchise has the same problems of being too large.Monica feels like a character that should've stayed as a side character, at least for now because it felt like she was promoted too quickly to shared lead roles.I feel like Ms. Marvel was the only character with real depth from having her own series and being more recent. Captain Marvel had a movie, but the issue is that people seem to dislike her because she only appears when needed, kicks ass, and then disappears without much exploration. I'd genuinely love to see more of her and her intergalactic adventures. The movie's villain comes from a 30-year stretch of Captain Marvel's adventures that we never got to see, and it feels like they just threw her in to compensate. Similarly, Captain Marvel's character seems under-explored, and it's disappointing because I wish they delved deeper. I love her, but her depictions have always felt a bit lackluster. It's frustrating that both Captain Marvel and Brie Larson have so much potential but aren't given enough to work with. So I get why people hate her, but I wish marvel did something to change that. This movie helps, but she wasn't the highlight of the film.Ms. Marvel truly carries movie; it felt more like her film than a Captain Marvel sequel. If you liked the Ms. Marvel TV series, this movie brings that same kind of fun to the table. And I'll say it again-I won't believe anyone who claims it's not fun because, despite its flaws, it's undeniably fun. Just being a hater if you don't accept that it's fun at the very least. At the very least.Edit after seeing some reviews: I find that those giving sub 3/10 ratings are a bit excessive- close the extremes of rating either 10/10 or 1/10. I typically reserve such low ratings for movies like ""Cosmic Sin (2021),"" Morgan Freeman's ""Vanquish,"" ""Beast,"" or ""It's a Wonderful Knife""-movies that are genuinely dull and uninspiring lol.","29 out of 74 found this helpful.

Take your family to watch it, it's a very family-friendly movie and unfortunately, it's not marketed as that. This was the introduction to the MCU for my 8yo niece (who had not seen Ms Marvel or anything else before). She actually followed it completely, and is now BIG on the Iman Vellani/Kamala Khan a.k.a. Ms. Marvel train. Vellani is such a star! Brie Larson and Teyonah Parris vibed so well with her and with each other. I think it's actually better than Captain Marvel on the whole, with a surprisingly moving ending.I think if you just go watch it, you'll be surprised on how big it is in fleshing out Captain Marvel & Monica Rambeau. Overall: Great team-up (with stakes) & an opportunity to take the whole fam!As someone tracking the whole MCU trajectory, I think it contains exactly the right amount of connectivity (no you don't have to watch anything before it, but I would not be surprised if it makes people go to Ms. Marvel or WandaVision if only because they're intrigued-that's how organic the set-up is, and Monica especially gets a flashback from the original film so that's not a problem at all). Meanwhile, Kamala's family was charming as hell and exactly the right supporting characters (with the kitties) to have in the film.Dar-Benn is an interesting antagonist in that the motivation is pretty darn clear and about right. This is not a movie about the Kree-Skrulls as such, it's really about the 3 main women, but when the antagonist's motivation is clear (which it was) then...it just works just enough.Don't listen to the others on this one, people have made whole careers out of being overly nitpicky about a film that's genuinely fun and they're all over your feed so...ignore them & go watch it.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

Brie's supposed infamy wasn't deserved, she had so much vitriol spewed her way and it took the focus away from her actual work. Her take on the character was less animated and more stoic but that choice is a product of many people, not just her. With all that said however, her performance in The Marvels is fine but falls short of spectacular. They make a concerted effort to humanize Carol but it only works somewhat and I actually missed some of the dry humour Brie brought to the original film. Iman Vellani shines the brightest of the central three. The humour surrounding Kamala's fangirling over Captain Marvel works the most consistently. She's certainly the most relatable and Iman's awkwardness comes across as genuine. Her earnestness could have been grating had it continued at the initial pace but she smartly tones it down slowly over the course of the run time to further Kamala's growth. I thought Teyonah Parris got the least meaty material as Monica Rambeau. Teyonah has been a scene-stealer in other projects for me and to be fair, she's still fine in The Marvels. But I think with her talent level, she should have been given more time and more room to really show what she could do in this role. Samuel L. Jackson is always welcome to pop in as Marvel regular Nick Fury. I got a couple of chuckles from him but I surprisingly even found his work a little underwhelming here. He lacked the same zip in The Marvels and he seemed less than engaged. Zawe Ashton tries as the group's foil Dar-Benn but she's destined to get lumped in with of Marvel's more forgettable antagonists.Carol's vast and varied power set creates all sorts of possibilities and when you combine that with the character swapping, there's so many different directions you could go with the action set-pieces. The Marvels looks good (and it's obviously well financed) and has a few standout moments in the action. Most notably the initial set-piece where the characters are flipping locations almost constantly has some satisfying punch. I also wanted to point out that just like Multiverse of Madness, the weirder moments in The Marvels are some of the best. The logic and practice surrounding the payoff of the Goose subplot seems a little flawed but I laughed hard and couldn't help but ponder the implications about where the movie decides to go with it.In my previous paragraph about the performances, I can't lay the blame for the scattershot success of The Marvels at the feet of the cast. The worst part of The Marvels is the wasted opportunities and choppy nature of the final product. There's all these rumours about extensive reshoots and drama behind-the-scenes and while I'm not read into the specifics, you can see it in this cut of this movie. So much of the drama or the set up for the respective character's emotional payoff is skipped over and it undercuts some of the more poignant scenes. Monica's regret and anger directed at Carol not being around comes off as petulant but only because it's not covered properly through the movie's flashbacks. Ditto for Carol's shame over how she handled the climactic battle with the Kree, it could have been affecting if given enough screen time but it's an afterthought in The Marvels. To punctuate this, what really astonished me was how rushed the ending felt. A shorter Marvel film is a blessing but the climactic battle between our heroes and Dar-Benn is so anti-climactic and the solution to her villainous plan has so little oomph and is so slapdash that The Marvels ends on a whimper. I was wondering if the movie had a mandate to be less than 2 hours and it was trying to beat the buzzer. I would also give The Marvels more credit if this decision tried to buck the formula but the movie is all the more formulaic for it.I'm usually in the theatre for opening weekend for most of Marvel's movies, some are amazing, most are good and you have the occasional misfire (I'm looking at you Ant-Man and the Wasp). I wanted to see what another Captain Marvel adventure would look like but I was also looking forward to this because it was Nia Da Costa directing. A tentpole franchise is a different animal but I'd truly enjoyed some of her other directorial efforts (Little Woods was great and Candyman was pretty good). I was disappointed that there wasn't any of her Candyman style flair in this. The Marvels is a passable effort with some intriguing moments packed in. It's certainly not the ""cinematic travesty"" some would have you believe. But it's also rushed, lacking distinctive qualities and overall just okay. With most of Marvel's recent output (Guardians 3 being the exception), we can't deny that superhero fatigue is officially here and if this genre is going to continue to thrive, we need a few daring films to steal back people's attention. I'd grade The Marvels somewhere between a 6-7 and as much as I wanted it to be worth a trip to the theatre, you'd get just as much checking it out on streaming. The original Captain Marvel was flawed but it was markedly better than The Marvels. I can't help but feel sorry for those involved with this project. There was obviously conflicting visions about what The Marvels should be and The Marvels clearly suffered for it. It's also most likely an unceremonious end for what could have been a key Marvel character moving forward and that's just plain disappointing.","20 out of 49 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Not Great but Still an Over-Hated Movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9643694/?ref_=tt_urv","nickpaulclash","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur64346732/?ref_=tt_urv","25 February 2024","I just watched this film on Disney+, having only seen negative comments. The only spoiler I saw was the *crazy* post-credits scene, so went in with basically no info outside the first trailer. However, I honestly didn't think it was as bad as people say.We'll start with the bad stuff. Plot is very questionable, filled with with weird decisions (singing planet), pretty forgettable villain and plot-holes. The movie feels incredibly rushed and the editing is very bizarre at times. Some of the CGI is a bit off, but that's only really on the cat(s).You can look at the above and notice some of the issues there are BIG BIG issues, but as I said, I went in with very bleak expectations and an attitude of just trying to have fun. And I can't lie, I did!The good stuff. Iman Vellani is full of such infectious joy and brings this movie up so much in watchability - Ms Marvel is a clear fan favourite for this reason. Sam Jackson is hilarious in this film, but not to the point of making the character goofy (Zemo in FATWS). Parris and Larson are both good in their roles, although it is worth noting that the chemistry between the two could've done with a few more scenes to really hit the mark. There's lots of fun scenes with Goose and the Khan family. There is one scene which had me in tears centered around cats - I will say nothing more. The action scenes are actually really damn good, certainly with the place-swapping aspects. It's easy to follow, smart and just cool af. CGI is also great! Sound design also great, music is decent but nothing really popped out on first watch.A lot of the hate to this film purely comes from the negative reception to Brie Larson, which I see as unwarranted, especially here. As touched upon, she isn't given a lot to work with, but I disagree with the comments suggesting she isn't trying here.It is worth noting that the post credits scene (there is only one) and the ending scene both set-up big things the MCU has coming. The latter has a suprise character appearance, but there is another big character appearance I had no prior knowledge about which did a good job of keeping the MCU well threaded - something potentially lost in some recent MCU projects (Eternals lul).Overall, I wouldn't say this movie is great, but I wouldn't say it is bad - it also isn't bland. There's enough for me to lean to the positive side of things, and if you just want something to watch to pass a bit of time then this movie will do no harm! Especially when considering it has a short runtime.6/10.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

So excited for the new era.My only complain is that the cause for this movie could have been easily avoided and they should have made a Captain Marvel 2 which explains what she did for 30 years in space alone. Also what happened to the skrulls and why do they still not have a home after such a long time? The movie left a lot of questions open.

I had quite some problems with the first Captain Marvel movie, specifically Brie Larson that came off as a quite unpleasant character and way too perfect in the context of the story. I liked her better here - the story made her not so perfect anymore and she tried to tone down her apparently innate smugness.Although I wasn't very convinced by the Ms. Marvel tv series, I thought that Iman Vellani gave an engaging and somehow charming performance. Her portrayal as the fangirl worked.I guess Teyonah Parris did alright, although I kept thinking that her character didn't really bring much to the table apart from being ""the explainer"".What did not work was the relationship between Parris and Larsons characters in the story....that just did not resonate.Let's get to the villain. Well, she had an interesting look. That's all I can say about her. Her motivation is quite dumbed down and her character just felt flat all around. Sad, could have been handled way better in the context of the story.Visually I'd say it was better than some previous isntallments in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I didn't mind some CGI imperfections, it was colorful and varied.Regarding the action scenes I'm torn. They are cut in manner that makes it hard to follow sometimes and nothing special, but they entertained, even though there was no emotional heft in any of them.The story is as simple as it gets, but at the same time there are so many inconsistent rules and logical flaws that at some point you just give up. The mechanic of the switching places is pretty much just a gimmick that makes barely any sense in the story. It's essentially an amusement park ride, you rush from A to B to C and you never really care why.What is good and bad at the same time is the pace. It has no lengths so it flies by fast. But it also seems to have been made for the TikTok generation, requiring virtually no attention span. This comes at the cost of character depth. But maybe it's better that way, confer above comments on the story.Having sad all that, I nevertheless give this a 7. I was entertained by it. It is mindless, it is sometimes cringy but is also ok fun.","91 out of 283 found this helpful.

It didn't rock my world, and it's no fault of casting or the decision to make a woman lead film.The writing is just a bit of a hot mess. I think Marvel writers across the franchise have written themself into a corner by not adapting to the needs of comic lore in a technomoderized world. The science in the film didn't sustain belief, and the motivations of the antagonist was unnecessarily convoluted, the furry subplot; an afterthought.Without good science, narratives like the multiverse, cosmic settings and space ecosystems do not hold together in the minds of viewers.The interpersonal politics lately has been unimaginative and way too human, and American, centric producing derivative content with space dressing.In other films, the humour in Marvel films was there to support the main plot, and allow the audience respite through its more serious content. Since the serious content is falling flat, the humour is trying to do all the heavy lifting and it's coming across canned and awkward. You see this in Thor Love and Thunder, you see it in some of the series work on Disney.Back to The Marvels. The cast carried themselves really well and were entirely believable in the characters they played. Honestly, I felt kind of like Disney was tossing diamonds on a dung heap with their fantastic casting having to work with a clumsy script with first draft energy, that leaves the audience distracted by its shortcomings. What a waste.Imo, the person that truly carried this film, EVERY TIME she was on screen was Toronto's Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan. She lit every scene, and that says a lot with heavy hitters like Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson sharing the screen.All in all, I do not regret my ticket purchase, and I WILL rewatch on streaming AND add the blu ray to my Marvel collection. I was entertained, but also a more than a little peeved.I hope Disney and its Marvel Studios franchise can pull it together and remember how to create art.6/10 stars.","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

She tries on her acting and drama and humour pants and found they didn't fit, so she just fumbles around and does a poor job.Rambo was introduced as an apologist for slavery and torture, got some kind of turning intangible thing going on which she got by walking for some reason, in a D+ show so she's probably new to most people.The bad guy was pathetic, the plan she sort of vaguely has, something to do with stealing an atmosphere for some reason to do something for some reason that wasn't made clear, to finish the plan of somebody but she doesn't say who that was, or what their plan was, and she is not in any way threatening. Her acting sucked also.The whole premise was idiotic. It could have been interesting if they had some kind of plan or plot before filming started instead of trying to fix it in post production, so what we got was sometimes three characters (one who fires light stuff, one who makes glowing purple stuff, and one who can apparently see light so she claimed in the script that her power is to not be blind) who sometimes switch places when they use their powers, but sometimes they don't.It's extremely inconsistent and only happens when convenient for the 'plot' or when some script writer with no sense of humour thinks it would be funny.Then lasers and flying around and fight scenes and some very sketchy CGI.And that's it. I tuned out for most of it, got bored after a while and so I can't remember most of what happened so I'll find out from a future Pitch Meeting who will do a much better job explaining the film than my semi-coherent rambling.","325 out of 664 found this helpful.

She finds one and the other is with Kamala Khan. Dar-Benn with the quantum band and her universal weapon starts the surge by creating jump points. It is upto Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel and say Professor Marvel to team up to find out what exactly Dar-Benn wants and stop her from making a bigger mess. With their powers interlinked, forcing them to keep switching into each other, how the trio manage to stop Dar-Benn forms rest of the story.The existing problem of MCU continues with The Marvels as well where we once again get a pointless addition to the franchise, whose sole purpose is to reveal that post credit scene. With a weak villain and an extremely powerful lead i.e. Captain Marvel who gets to team up with two others, no matter how much the stakes are raised, it never feels like a challenge to the mighty superhero. Instead the focus is on the teen humor.The best thing about The Marvels is it's short runtime. The humor not always work as intended though some of the jokes did work to an extent. The emotions too were on the surface level only. The reunion honestly should've been dealt better. Resorting to solving the high stakes problem in a simpler way or even randomly figuring out the solution, failed to register. On paper, it wasn't a terrible idea but when you have Captain Marvel, it is mandatory to give her a strong villain and a better story she deserves. Otherwise, there is only so much Kamala Khan can do with her jokes.","187 out of 373 found this helpful.

More importantly, it does my heart so much good to see a functional, loving, supportive family in a superhero movie. I'm SO over all the dark, gritty superhero stuff lately that I could honestly watch Kamala and her family being cute all day long at this point.Monica is well written and funny (and nice to look at). Carol is better written than last time and Brie Larson seems to have gotten over whatever stiffness she had with the character which actually makes her seem like a human this time around; which is nice. Even Nick Fury is better written and funnier than he's been in a long time.The movie itself is tight and lean, pushing through the plot succinctly without feeling rushed; and it has some pretty cool fight scenes. (Kamala's slidey/spinney fighting style was particularly neat to watch. When did she learn that?)
It works better than trying to make every movie a two hour plus epic when it's not necessarily warranted. It's not like adding a rich backstory or deep pathos for Dar-Benn is going to convince any of the people leaving three star reviews. She did what she needed to do and left room for the more interesting characters to shine, I don't think there's anything wrong with that.It's no secret Marvel's been stumbling lately and this isn't the movie that's going to turn things around for them, but it's definitely a step in the right direction.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

If you are a die-hard Marvel fan this isn't the greatest one they've made, but it's better than other recent releases. In this movie, fans are able to get a better feel for the newer characters like Monica and the Khan family. The special effects were amazing a majority of the time with only few looking below average. There are a lot of laughs for younger kids (12 and under). If you want to see a movie, regardless of if you're a Marvel fan or not, this is a decent watch. I would definitely rewatch for the cats. I would recommend for the average viewer. Note: there is a small amount of cursing so be aware of that if you are taking children, but it is kept to a minimum.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Do not believe at all in their emotions. The whole kid like manner - ugh just so hard to watch.Fights - looks like someone was told to just do what you want. Films of 2000x had much better fight and action scenes.For who this film. Honestly - I don't know. Maybe for 8-10 years old children who are only interested with bright scenes without any plot, without actors doing their job to express their characters. Definitely not for phase 1-3 marvels fans.","45 out of 82 found this helpful.

If you expect too much you will not like this movie.However if you wanna be entertained by three charismatic leads than this is the movie for you. Its just lighthearted fun. The shorter runtime also means that for once you do not feel overwhelmed while watching. It also means you probably won't be talking about this movie for months. But it was worth it watching it at the theater and i will definitly rewatch it again if i wanna have a good 105 minutes of entertainment. Expectation is really everything with this movie.

While it holds the potential to shape the overarching narrative, it falls short in delivering a fully satisfying storyline.Despite being an underrated addition to the MCU timeline, ""The Marvels"" feels somewhat half-baked, struggling to delve deeply into the character arcs of key figures. The backgrounds of pivotal characters, such as the villain Dar-Benn and Captain Marvel's husband Prince Yan, are presented as mere fillers rather than substantial contributors to the plot. Brie Larson, reprising her role as Carol Danvers, brings a commendable performance, but her character seems to lack the same charismatic spark seen in her solo movie and ""Avengers: Endgame.""Teyonah Parris stands out as a bright spot, delivering a strong performance that hints at the potential for a stand-alone sequel. However, the film's weakest link appears to be Iman Vellani as Miss Marvel. As a character poised to lead the Young Avengers in the future, Vellani's portrayal falls short, indicating a need for more intensive acting workshops to bring depth to her performance.The film's storyline adaptation, creative choices, and certain scenes leave room for improvement. The narrative fails to provide the necessary depth and exploration required for a truly satisfying superhero experience. The gaps in character development and the incomplete backstories of key figures hinder the movie from reaching its full potential.""The Marvels"" sits on the precipice of greatness, showcasing glimpses of brilliance amid its shortcomings. As the MCU continues to expand, one can only hope that subsequent entries will refine the storytelling and character exploration, allowing these Marvels to truly shine in the superhero pantheon.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Including all the way back to Blade. I enjoy a fantasy, sci-fi or action romp. Also I think it is important to go into every movie with a blank mind because else you will just see the same people, stories and setting over and over again.The Marvels is clearly aimed at a different audience than 40 year olds (like me) who are still into comic stuff (not like me). So I am not surprised that those old dudes give it so much shade but come on...take a chill pill; Captain Marvel is not really the (comic) franchise to get upset about. Also like some comics, some movies are just aimed at a different audience. Would you get upset if they didn't portray Squirrel Girl correctly?But then who is it aimed at? Well, clearly it is a Disney movie (even with singing...which was very cringy) and they are aiming it at a young, teen female audience.Which could work, in a ""mom takes her 12 year old comic-fan daughter to a cute popcorn, superhero flick"" kind of way. Which is fine, of course...However, how many 12 year old comic-fan girls are there out there, really? Apparently, not enough according the number of movie go-ers and the few people in the theater I was in.I did appreciate it though for it was; It was all very, very light-hearted but it definitely had its moments of well done fighting scenes and some odd-ball humor. Nothing tense with no real highs or challenging.Just set your bar to Scoobydoo or Spy Kids the movie and take the kids.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The impression I had was that there were much more to be explained and they could have used more time to connect all the dots.Talking about ""connect the dots"" this is exactly what Disney/Marvel are trying with their ""expanded universe"", but this is exactly where they are also failing. A movie should be complete on its own. I shouldn't be required to watch other movies or pay for a streaming (which I don't pay for a long time now) and watch a number of other TV Shows to understand the entire universe or all the references.Don't get me wrong, what Marvel did on MCU phase 1 (and slightly on Phase 2) worked.

It could have done away with some forced cameos and some repeated scenes that does basically the same thing over and over, and instead focused a bit more on character growth and dialogue, but over all it worked well. The three leads of Monica Rambeuo, Captain Marvel and Ms. Marvel worked well together, it didn't feel like they were rubbing it in the audience face that it was a female lead cast, it was just a super hero movie that happened to have female leads. At 105 minutes it's on the shorter end for a Marvel movie, but it means it is more dense and rarely gets stale and it doesn't overstay it's welcome, though the comic reliefs in the form of Kamala's family and Goose the cat/flerken could have been given slightly less screen time in my opinion. One of the biggest problems is that to fully be on track going in you have to have watched not only Captain Marvel and Endgame, but also WandaVision and Ms. Marvel. It's getting very hard to keep up and make sure you are caught up and remember enough before going in to each new marvel movie, but if you aren't you could be left clueless as to what is going on. Over all not on par with Marvels best, but a step in the right direction compared to the latest bunch on movies, a sentiment I heard echoed from several of the 50 or so people that had made it to the cinema for opening night.","84 out of 280 found this helpful.

I lamented unwarranted negative previews and attributed Marvel's recent setbacks to the lackluster reception of ""Quantumania"" and ""Secret Invasion"" and the SAG strike hindering promotional efforts.Despite initial skepticism, I found the film more enjoyable than expected. I appreciated the portrayal of Carol Danvers as a more expressive and even awkward character, likening her to a Disney Princess. I also found the Kree's perspective on Captain Marvel as a unintentional villain intriguing, though I wished the film explored this aspect further, drawing a parallel to ""Civil War.""The primary weakness, according to I, was the underdeveloped villain Dar-Benn, serving mainly as a catalyst for broader plot elements like the introduction of a parallel universe (X-Men films) and the formation of the Young Avengers.

Kamala and Monica are awesome characters, and though Carol is a bit boring character by herself, she adds a needed contrast as part of the marvels team.The humour was great. Especially the cat stuff was pure gold, and the dynamics between the main characters were really succesful. Also Fury and the Khan family were fun to watch.The plot was all in all okay.The special effects look a lot better than on some of the other recent mcu pieces (Ant-man etc).Cons:
The main events were cut too short due the length of the movie, leaving the plot a little shallow. So this one could've actually been a little longer.Even though I love cats, I think there were simply too many of them, considering the amount of screen time they actually got.The main villain was awkward. I couldn't tell if she was badly directed or if the acting was bad, but she just seemed to be really out of place. Most certainly she was badly written.All in all, it was an okay movie with entertaining action bits and comedy. That's certainly more than we got to see from mcu in 2023 as a whole.","9 out of 14 found this helpful.

It's not End Game, but it certainly is not the worst Marvel movie either. The movie is okay, I thoroughly enjoyed while I was in the theatre. I was not bored a single time. Maybe the end battle was not epic as we expect from this universe, but it was fun. I needed multiple sittings to finish the Love and Thunder, this was way more entertaining.I have watched all the previous series and the movies, and Kamala Khan blooms in this movie from the lost Jersey City girl we know her as. DarBen is way prettier in the movie than in the preview as well. Previews did not do her justice; she sounds great and fits the role fine.All these hate to drown the movie seems somewhat coordinated. If you dissect every single line spoken, and every single logic they try to explain, then maybe you should go watch something else. If you like superhero movies, and you are okay with eliminating half the universe with a snap and bringing them back again after 5 years, then you don't really have an argument.I am glad I went to see the movie in the theatre despite of all negative reviews. I laughed out many times, some parts were sweet, and some a little sad. I certainly recommend this movie; a solid 7 for its entertainment value.","10 out of 24 found this helpful.

I think that's about right and that's what I give it personally. It's bright and lively and brings back lots of characters from recent MCU outings, including the first Captain Marvel movie but also WandaVision and Ms Marvel, which are pretty much essential to understanding the backstory for all of them -- otherwise what's going on will seem a bit confusing. And it's always nice to see Nick Fury again, and Kamala Khan's family too.The lead roles played by Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani, are all fine and much of their on-screen time is spent getting to know each other (in rather different ways than three guys would do, which I appreciated). If action is what you go to see though, there's plenty of it too. If anything it's just a bit too short overall, the scene-to-scene transitions can be a bit abrupt and I would have liked some smoother continuity with more time to dig beyond surface interactions. A couple of sections (the one on the water planet whose name I forget, and the later one with all the Flerken kitties) veer off into crazyland territory, but they're still fun. Add in Zawe Ashton's role as Dar-Benn, and all four of the lead roles are women. About time.Based on their reactions, it looks like a lot of 'fans' just want Avengers Endgame types of films all the time. But that stage of the MCU movies is gone, and it's not coming back. Not all superhero offerings have to be Major Events. We're more into the era of ""ordinary superhero"" movies now that aren't all tentpoles, and I don't mind that we're getting a variety of approaches and styles from different directors and studios. The Marvels fits into that category. Just go and have fun! Enjoy it for what it is.","11 out of 28 found this helpful.

It's ruining the legacy that was built the hard work that was done by the actors, writers, directors.. This movie with goofy dialouges.Editing Woes:
One of the glaring issues with ""The Marvels"" is its lackluster editing. Scenes feel disjointed, and transitions are often jarring, leaving the audience struggling to follow the narrative. The pacing is inconsistent, robbing the film of the seamless flow that is crucial for an engaging superhero movie.Goofy Dialogues:
The dialogue in ""The Marvels"" is another major letdown. Instead of the sharp, witty exchanges we've come to expect from Marvel films, the lines often come across as forced and cringe-worthy. The humor feels forced, and the attempts at banter fall flat. It's as if the writers were trying too hard to replicate the success of previous Marvel movies, resulting in a script that lacks the authenticity and charm we've grown accustomed to.Character Development:
Beyond the technical aspects, ""The Marvels"" also disappoints in terms of character development. The lack of depth in character arcs leaves the audience emotionally disconnected from the protagonists. While Marvel films have excelled in crafting compelling characters with relatable struggles, this installment seems to prioritize spectacle over substance.","41 out of 79 found this helpful.

The one bright spark is Iman Vellani, who looks like she's genuinely having fun and it shows in her performance. I haven't seen the Ms Marvel show but I might actually give it a watch now. Probably not though.It's sad to see what the MCU has become; a muddled, directionless mess with bad CGI taking the place of good screenplays, tight and clever writing, and likeable characters that you actually care about.Where do they go from here? Who's knows, but I would give this a swerve if I were you.","70 out of 146 found this helpful.

Brie Larson, Iman Vellani, and Teyonah Parris create a wonderfully charming team, as you can truly feel the friendship growing throughout the film. While Brie Larson is always captivating, Iman Vellani steals the show every moment she is on screen. Her performance as Kamala Khan is consistently charismatic, comedically well timed, and delightfully quotable. Unfortunately, the villainous Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton) was underutilized and the short runtime felt like it should've stretched to give her more character building. The supporting cast all compliment the story well, with Nick Fury (Sam L. Jackson) and the Khan family having fun with their side plot. While the film is full of exciting moments, I wish they had fully committed to the wacky elements, as this feels similar to Ragnarok, but it stayed too tame to really blow you away. For the most part, the visual effects look appealing and it isn't until the mid-credits scene that things start to look rushed and rubbery. Though I would have loved to see them play more with the interesting additions brought into the MCU, The Marvels is a very charming and captivating ride, akin to films like Ragnarok or Guardians,","12 out of 32 found this helpful.

Clocking in at an excessive runtime, the film's fundamental flaw lies in its inability to rise above the tired tropes that have become synonymous with the superhero genre.From the opening scenes, it's apparent that the Marvels movie subscribes to a predictable formula. The plot, a mishmash of recycled elements from previous Marvel films, lacks the ingenuity needed to captivate a seasoned audience. It's as if the writers assembled a checklist of superhero clichés and ticked them off one by one, resulting in a narrative that feels more like a derivative compilation than a fresh, engaging story.Character development, a cornerstone of compelling cinema, is woefully neglected. The protagonists are reduced to mere caricatures, each conforming to their respective archetypes without any meaningful exploration of their motivations or inner conflicts. As a result, the emotional resonance one might expect from a character-driven narrative is conspicuously absent, leaving viewers with a sense of detachment from the on-screen personas.The attempts at injecting humor into the script fall embarrassingly flat. The dialogue, ostensibly crafted for wit and banter, comes off as forced and contrived. Instead of eliciting genuine laughs, the film relies on tired punchlines and predictable comedic timing, perpetuating the unfortunate trend of Marvel movies sacrificing substance for cheap laughs. The incessant quipping undermines the gravity of the situations the characters find themselves in, diluting any sense of tension or urgency.Visually, the Marvels movie relies excessively on CGI spectacle at the expense of substance. The overabundance of computer-generated effects creates a glossy, artificial veneer that distances the audience from the narrative. The action sequences, while visually impressive, lack the visceral impact and coherence necessary to make them truly memorable. The reliance on CGI spectacle over practical effects further contributes to the film's overall lack of authenticity, robbing it of the tangible, tactile quality that distinguishes exceptional cinema.The film's pacing is another significant issue. At times sluggish and meandering, at others rushed and chaotic, the Marvels movie struggles to find a rhythm that sustains audience engagement. The narrative feels disjointed, with subplots introduced and abandoned haphazardly, leaving viewers with a sense of narrative whiplash. The erratic pacing exacerbates the film's already evident lack of focus, preventing any semblance of a cohesive and compelling story from emerging.Moreover, the Marvels movie falls prey to the pitfalls of franchise fatigue. As the umpteenth installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, it fails to offer anything substantially different or innovative. Instead of pushing the boundaries of the genre or challenging audience expectations, the film adheres rigidly to the established Marvel formula, resulting in a cinematic experience that feels more like a checklist of familiar elements than a groundbreaking work of art.In conclusion, the Marvels movie represents a missed opportunity for the superhero genre to evolve and transcend its well-worn conventions. From a lackluster plot and underdeveloped characters to uninspired humor and excessive reliance on CGI, the film embodies the worst tendencies of contemporary blockbuster cinema. While undoubtedly a financial success, its critical reception should serve as a wake-up call for filmmakers to prioritize substance over spectacle and strive for originality in a genre saturated with mediocrity.","27 out of 51 found this helpful.

It appears that her new powers connect her to ""Danvers"" (Brie Larson) and her slightly estranged cohort ""Rambeau"" (Teyonah Parris). When they use their powers they find themselves transported into each other's shoes - causing mayhem all over the place, especially at the family home of the rookie superhero who is as yet unaware of just quite how powerful her shiny amulet is. ""Dar-Benn"" is out for revenge. After ""Danvers"" destroyed the AI that controlled their planet, it has gone into terminal decay and so she decides to reinstate her world by stealing the atmosphere from one world, then the water from another - where they only speak in song, so perhaps no great loss - before deciding to borrow the sun from Earth to reinvigorate their own failing star. With a little help from ""Nick Fury"" (Samuel L. Jackson) the three have to galvanise their powers and focus on thwarting this dastardly design before it's too late. Now there is nothing even remotely original in this. It's all join the dots Marvel adventure with the usual pyrotechnics, spectacular visual effects and thinnest of stories. The denouement is never in doubt and actually feels rather rushed after a first half hour of repetitive combat scenes that don't draw breath but don't really entertain either. Larson is a natural actor (she reminds me a lot of Grace Kelly) but nobody here really has much by way of dialogue to work with as we see this film manoeuvred into the path of another franchise that it would appear destined to join with next time. Barbra Streisand makes a surprise (vocal) appearance during quite an innovative scene herding cats and simultaneously saving people, but I found the rest of this to be same old, same old and though shorter than we are used to, it's still all a bit old hat. Looks good, but I doubt that you'll never remember it.","20 out of 60 found this helpful.

Ms. Marvel definitely stole the show. It is definitely a bright spot in Phase 5. Quantumania was just ""OK"" but The Marvels was fun with so much more witty banter and chemistry between the heroes. Ironically, for all the fun the previous Ant Man movies were, it surprised me how The Marvels beat Quantumania in that department (anybody seen Luis?).After enduring Marvel's Phase 4 with the surprising train wreck that was ""Thor: Love & Thunder"" (especially after ""Thor: Ragnarok"" was so brilliant) and the horrible ""Eternals"", it was nice seeing a Marvel movie that was fun and exciting and where the heroes were engaging and had chemistry together. Especially enjoyed seeing Nick Fury again in a good story since ""Secret Invasion"" disappointed so badly.I will agree with most people that Marvel Phase 5 has been awful, but I feel like The Marvels just got hate because it was surrounded by so many other bad projects (similar to how ""Solo: A Star Wars Story"" suffered from following ""The Last Jedi""). This MCU installment made me smile and kept the action flowing and had solid character growth for the heroes. The vibe I got from Ms. Marvel was very similar to watching Tom Holland's Spider-Man -- just enjoyable.Obviously, The Marvels was no ""Iron Man"", ""Avengers"", ""Civil War"", ""Infinity War"" or ""End Game"", but it is definitely in the top half of MCU movies for me. I would definitely enjoy re-watching The Marvels more than watching ""Thor: The Dark World"" or ""Iron Man 3"" or even ""Doctor Strange"" -- and ""The Mavels"" definitely surpasses its predecessor ""Captain Marvel"".I am hoping ""Captain America: Brave New World"" is good but I have low exceptions for ""Thunderbolts"".

However, after finally watching it, I must say that the film left me hugely disappointed. Here's why:1. Muddled Storyline: ""The Marvels"" suffered from a convoluted and messy plot. The filmmakers seemed to cram too many characters and subplots into a single movie, resulting in a lack of focus and coherence. It felt like they were trying to replicate the success of Avengers, but failed miserably in creating a cohesive narrative.2. Weak Character Development: Despite bringing together three incredibly powerful heroines, ""The Marvels"" failed to give any of them proper development. The characters lacked depth, making it hard to form any emotional connection with them. This was a wasted opportunity to explore their individual journeys and strengths, leaving viewers disconnected and uninterested in their struggles.3. Poor Chemistry: A major disappointment was the complete lack of chemistry among the main characters. The dynamic between Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, and Monica Rambeau was forced and lacked any natural charm. The interactions between them often felt contrived and unconvincing, leaving me wishing for more impactful and engaging performances.4. Underwhelming Action Sequences: For a Marvel film, the action sequences were shockingly dull. The choreography was uninspired, with repetitive fight scenes that failed to excite or engage the audience. With the vast array of superpowers and abilities in the Marvel Universe, it was baffling to see such lackluster action on display.5. Anticlimactic Villain: The villain of ""The Marvels"" was completely forgettable. Their motivations were unclear, and their screen time was limited to few inconsequential scenes. There was no real threat or sense of danger, which undermined the stakes and made the climax feel underwhelming.Overall, ""The Marvels"" was a disappointment in almost every aspect. From a messy plot to weak character development and lackluster action sequences, this film failed to capture the essence of what makes Marvel movies so special. It pales in comparison to previous entries in the franchise, leaving viewers feeling unsatisfied and let down.","15 out of 26 found this helpful.

"","","Bland, lazy, and uninspired...The Marvels is anything but marvelous, not even as a marvelous disaster.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9613364/?ref_=tt_urv","Darwinskid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur12357883/?ref_=tt_urv","10 February 2024","The Marvels is exactly the sort of movie that critics and trolls would dismiss the output of Marvel Studios back when the Marvel Cinematic Universe was in its second and third phases - shallow, childish nonsense with empty spectacle. The actors and director try but ultimately the story is too undercooked with not enough heart and soul put into it, and it rushes everything that there is just not enough time to properly invest into the characters.Since the terrible box office run, I have come across many attempts to defend this motion picture, and I have also seen some people try to justify their argument that the reason why its performance was terrible was a result of an atypical situation. Each and every one I must say has not been either compelling or sound in logic, so to save a reader the trouble, I am going to list the most common ones you may run into, and my reactions towards them.""It's not a perfect movie."" Well, no movie is. Even the top 10 movies of the Internet Movie Database's Top 250 list have technical and continuity errors listed for them, so while one can argue they are perfect in various ways, evidently they are not in all ways. Statements of this sort are just empty ones if we're being honest, because it admits that there are issues within the picture that cannot be completely defended and spun around to appear of great quality.""I didn't hate it."" Well, aren't you being kind. Here's a newsflash for you though, you are not supposed to hate it. 99% of films are designed with the intention that the audience will come away liking the picture, even if the filmmakers did not set out to entertain or excite the viewer with spectacle and pretty colors. The people who constructed this very movie were hoping to draw enough favorability from the general population to bring in amazing profit. These statements are neither a compliment or a very good endorsement if you ask most people.""It's just a fun movie, do not overthink it!"" This argument would probably work if the film was not built on the foundation of a cinematic universe that has been up and running since 2008, which has a history of producing content regarded as some of the best in superhero cinema in particular and blockbuster filmmaking in general. A silly, no-brainer yarn is a step-back for Marvel Studios after all they have accomplished in the past, and they shouldn't settle for it, either. Furthermore, the movie asks a lot from the viewer, if you did not see either WandaVision or Ms. Marvel on Disney+ you will be very lost, but to make matters worse there is a lot of plot mumbo jumbo that is introduced in the film that is too shy in detail that you feel another movie or series is missing for better context. The plot is just not as simple as it wishes to present itself as, and rather than coming across as complex, it is coming across as complicated nonsense.""People who didn't like it are allergic to having fun at the movies!"" This is such a strawman argument. Sometimes the problem lies with the filmmaking itself than of the individual, who may (for all you know) have come in wanting to very much enjoy it.""It bombed at the box office because society rejects female led movies."" Yet the very same year, Barbie was a major box office success. The original Captain Marvel picture also performed good in theaters in 2019. Other female led films and television series also have performed well, why this movie underperformed is the same reason why many male led films underperformed - lack of interest and lack of faith in the product.""It bombed at the box office because of the strikes."" Yet Barbie and other movies released in the year did fine despite of the strikes.""Just you wait, in a few years it will be regarded as the Blade Runner for a new generation."" I genuinely question if the people making this argument have even seen at least one version of Blade Runner or really understand why it went from a box office failure to an acclaimed work of science fiction filmmaking.Such a disappointment, I was hoping Marvel Studios would aim higher for a follow-up to Captain Marvel, I liked the Ms. Marvel series quite a bit, and while I had issues with WandaVision I did think Teyonah Parris was quite good as Monica Rambeau and thought the conflict between her and Carol Danvers could have played out very interestingly on screen, but it is dealt with fairly quickly.The worst Marvel Studios has made to date? No, but it is not far from holding the title.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

It seems, they overdid it and at the moment, there is nothing new to find.

As one of them, who skipped Barbie (as opposed to women who skipped this), I gotta say this was complete waste of time (and money). It's just a bad movie. But let's start from the beginning.Brie Larson wasn't a very good choice for any Marvel superheroine, certainly not for an obscure character like Captain Marvel. But the movie came and the rest is history. And now its half-sequel is here. And boy, as I stated already, it was royally bad. The director, who skipped the post-production on The Marvels middle-way thru, attempted to sell her film as wacky, goofy fun. I can only say this. The Marvels is not wacky, but it is goofy. And goofy not in a good way. Superheroes are goofy by default, but this took the game a step further.The plot is the biggest flaw. It lost its marbles after the first ten minutes and I didn't care about it for the rest of its 105mins running time. Which seems too short for these kinds of films, although 105mins was too much for me. The biggest selling gimmick, our trio exchanging powers, even after all obscure explanations, never really made any sense and their switching powers seem to work only when filmmakers tell you they work. Not one of the three heroines has a meaningful character arc, the movie should be about Carol Danvers, and while there was room for all three, I never had the feeling they were experiencing an emotional journey. Kamala just wants to be there, Monica acts like a job drone and Carol in the search of something that is even unknown to her. Even the villain is just a flat-out cardboard villain. People singing sequence is gross. Kittens swallowing people as a means of transportation massive gross. Music apart from generic bombastic tunes is meh, CGI atrocious, the editing a work of hack...a fail on very single level. The eponymous trio lacks chemistry. Kamala's quotes are sophomoric, but given she is an overexcited teenage girl, that can be forgiven, Monica seems the most level-headed of the trio, and Brie surprisingly acted less robotic and more nuanced than in the original Captain Marvel (those trailers didn't do her justice), but not in a game-changing manner.I guess we are reaching now the twilight of superheroes. All pointing that similar fate awaits Aquaman 2.","55 out of 115 found this helpful.

If you don't, it's just a harmless, fun, slightly scatty Marvel chick flick. On the plus side it's not a Jaws 2 re-run, but a good sequel and story continuation due to the additional cast and backstory each character brings. There's also a much more relatable Carol Danvers (rather than the completely invincible character seen to date) and a revenge story so simple a child could follow it - although I wasn't clear how a civil war on Hala caused problems with their sun. Whilst slightly gross, using the flerkens as a means of emergency transport makes perfect, practical sense to the mind of an engineer and the accompanying music from Cats was a nice comedic touch. On the downside it could have done without the singing planet sequence, the CGI is dodgy in places and the pacing is sometimes uneven. This could be related to the reported production problems and reshoots, but the fight scene with the Skrulls in Kamala's house went on too long and the ending seemed rushed (imo). Compared to others in the recent run of underperforming female-fronted films The Marvels is probably the best out of the lot.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The plot whirlwinds through cosmic conundrums with Carol Danvers leading the charge against the Supreme Intelligence, sparking a Kree civil war that leaves their planet Hala gasping for... well, everything. Enter Dar-Benn with her fancy Quantum Band, ripping open jump points like they're discount coupons for interstellar travel. The ripple effects mess with Earth's S. A. B. E. R. Station, sending our heroes on a light-powered pinball adventure across the universe. It's as chaotic as it sounds, teetering on the edge of being a galaxy-brained masterpiece and a celestial soap opera.The heart of the movie beats within its quantum entangled trio: Danvers, Rambeau, and Kamala Khan, who find themselves in a cosmic game of musical chairs, swapping places across the cosmos faster than you can say ""quantum leap."" It's an inventive twist, leveraging their light-based powers in a manner that's both visually stunning and narratively dizzying. Watching Kamala's family home turn into a battleground for Kree enemies is like observing someone throw a house party while their parents are out, only for the Avengers to crash it - amusing yet anxiety-inducing. The film's middle act, set against the backdrop of Skrull refugee crises and peace treaties, almost hits the mark with its political undertones, if only it didn't feel like we were sprinting through a ""Cosmic Conflicts for Dummies"" guidebook.In the grand scheme of the universe, ""The Marvels"" orbits successfully around the entertainment galaxy but struggles with its gravitational pull towards coherence. The climax, featuring Dar-Benn's apocalyptic aqua-heist and solar snatch-and-grab, spirals into a spectacle that's both eye-popping and mildly exasperating. The resolution, a mix of heroism and quantum physics homework, leaves us pondering the elasticity of comic book science. Kamala's journey to forming a new team sparkles with potential, teasing future adventures that hopefully balance heart, humor, and heroics more evenly. As for the mid-credits scene, it's a Marvel staple, serving as both a tantalizing teaser and a reminder that in this cinematic universe, the end is never truly the end.So, is ""The Marvels"" worth the intergalactic ride? Absolutely - if your idea of a good time involves deciphering quantum physics while watching superheroes redecorate the universe. It's a three-star spectacle that shines brightly but occasionally gets lost in its own astronomical ambitions.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The future for Marvel does not look good.They need to change course and reconnect with the audience. I am not sure who the targeted audience is but it sure isn't the fanbase that earned them billions. It seems that money is no issue for them since they can afford to produce this kind of ""entertainment"" The direction they are heading is going to drive the fans away..Sad, sad ...","11 out of 18 found this helpful.

This movie was fun great action sequences especially the bonding scene. We got to see some new places we haven't seen before and a twist on communication we have seen. Kamala warms this movie and steals pretty much every scene she's in. Kamala's family, Nick Fury and Monica are all great roles to keep the movie lite. We get a deeper look into Captain Marvel's character and some backstory we weren't aware of previously (at least from a film perspective). Take yourself, a kid or significant other if you just want a good time out of the house. Leave the seriousness for documentaries or the real world because it's heavy enough out here for all of us.","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

Just goes to prove that some people will just hate to hate.My main letdowns were: The villain although her motives understandable was underwhelming and forgetable (and I loved Zawe Ashton in Fresh Meat and Wanderlust, so its not on the actrice). I also found Monica to not really add to much value. CGI was not great at some pointsOn the other hand I enjoyed the pacing, duration of the movie and the power switching concept. Also liked the humour in the form of Kamalah, her family and the flerkens, without it being to much (*cough cough Thor L&T*). Carol got some much needed softness.All in all it was an entertaining yet unimaginative superhero movie with some cool fightsequences, fun main characters and yes some flaws. Everyone who scored below a 4 or above an 8 just doesnt know nuance or objectivity.","15 out of 48 found this helpful.

I almost walked out to go sit in the lobby it's so boring. I don't care what kind of agenda is being pushed in this movie, just don't be boring. I could not stop nodding off during this movie. Even though this movie is only an hour and a half, it was too long and hard to care about anything going on. I've seen both Oppenheimer and Flowers of the Killer Moon and never once felt tired during those and both are over 3 hours.I actually didn't mind the first Captain Marvel movie. It was alright, I don't think it deserved all the hate that it got. But this one is terrible and maybe the worst Marvel movie yet. Which is sad because Eternals, Thor 4, Ant-Man 3, and Shang Chi exists.Two of the biggest problems with this movie for me were Nick Fury and Ms. Marvel. It's sad what Nick Fury has been reduced to now. His character is now a joke and it's about time for Sam Jackson to hang it up with this character. There is a scene towards the end with his character and cats evacuating a ship that is so stupid, if I would have come alone, I would have walked out.I don't know anything about Ms. Marvel because I didn't waste my time watching the Disney+ show. And after seeing this and seeing how annoying she is, I will never watch that show. Her voice and her yelling were so damn annoying.I think this is it folks, Marvel is truly dead but truthfully, it's been dead way before Phase 4 or whatever phase this is. There's just no Iron Man or Captain America to hide how bad these movies are anymore. And no amount of cameos from 2000's Marvel films, fan service or backing a Brinks truck up to Robert Downey Jr.'s house is going to save these movies either.","153 out of 351 found this helpful.

Emotionally heavy scenes are cut short, that results in the point being made but not hammered home. It has an exciting post credit scene, so do stay for that.","17 out of 56 found this helpful.

But, I do personally enjoy Ms Marvel and Monica. I also enjoyed Captain Marvel in this movie, sometimes her character has annoyed me due to coming across as a bit arrogant but I think this movie humbles her a lot more by reintroducing Monica to her life.I wanted to praise Zawe Ashton for her role as Dar-Benn; I thought she played a really good villain, I'm almost a little sad we won't get to see that character again! And I refuse to believe that her asking Prince Yan to kneal was not a Loki reference ;)It's overall just a fun movie. It IS silly at times and I can understand why some people might not like silly themes as we have been getting that a lot of that with Marvel, especially with movies like Love and Thunder.BUT we do get a nice introduction to some old favourites at the end!!!I expected people to not really enjoy this movie before I even went to watch it. People don't like Brie Larson, people find Ms Marvel's character annoying, it didn't really have a fair chance from the go.

The grounding premise is preposterous and plenty of the scenes are equally ludicrous. Some of the time it seems to be done with a humorous glint but at other times it doesn't work.Captain Marvel (Brie Larson) is a lot better here than she has been before and I think that is mostly due to the writing. In previous incarnations she has been too powerful and has come off as obnoxious but now we get to see a person with vulnerabilities and it turns out that Larson wasn't the problem with the character after all.Iman Vellani as Ms. Marvel is very much the same as she was in the series. I find her a tad annoying at times but overall her charm makes it work.Monica Rambeau is played well by Teyonah Parris but her character is a bit confusing to me. The main function of the role is to give Captain Marvel some sorely needed character depth.The action is so fast that some may find it confusing and the humor is almost slapstick a lot of the time. It is definitely more juvenile than anything in earlier phases of the MCU. Still, compared to the last Ant Man movie this is a big leap forward. I was entertained and that is a good start but the fact that I thought the end credit scene was the most entertaining scene in the movie indicates how much room there is for improvement.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Amen to the South Asian representation!I'll admit, my movie opinions always seem to be different than others'....for instance I much preferred Wonder Woman 1984, which others seemed to dislike, compared to the first WW. I do tend to prefer the wacky over the ordinary, and this movie was a little wacky.Anyway, yes, this movie is a little chaotic and crazy, but that's what made it engaging for me.To answer another reviewer's question about who this movie appeals to - nope, not just teen girls. Grown adults liked this movie as well.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

From start to finish, this film was an utter mess, failing to deliver on almost every front.First and foremost, the plot was convoluted and nonsensical. It felt like the writers threw in every idea they could think of without any regard for coherence or character development. The story jumped from one battle scene to another, with no meaningful connection or emotional depth. It was a chaotic mishmash of flashy special effects and mindless action, leaving no room for genuine storytelling.The performances were equally lackluster. Despite the star-studded cast, the actors seemed uninterested and phoned in their performances. The once charismatic and captivating characters were reduced to one-dimensional caricatures, devoid of any real personality or growth. It was disheartening to witness such wasted talent on the screen.Furthermore, the dialogue was cringe-worthy at best. The attempts at humor fell flat, and the attempts at heartfelt moments were contrived and forced. It was as if the scriptwriters had run out of original ideas and resorted to recycling tired clichés and predictable tropes.Even the visual effects, which are usually a saving grace for superhero films, were subpar. The CGI was inconsistent, with moments of stunning visuals mixed with jarring and poorly executed sequences. It was a constant reminder of the film's lack of attention to detail and overall quality.In conclusion, ""Avengers"" is a disappointing and forgettable addition to the superhero genre. It fails to capture the magic and excitement of its predecessors, instead succumbing to lazy storytelling, uninspired performances, and underwhelming visual effects. Save your time and skip this cinematic disaster.","15 out of 27 found this helpful.

This film does a great job reminding the audience of the main three protagonists' backstories without missing a beat. The chemistry between the three women is strong, with Captain Marvel finally feeling human.Though the stakes are high, the film is surprisingly grounded. Each character has their moment to shine, even with the fate of the world hanging in the balance. The film does not take itself too seriously, and there are many carefree moments reminiscent of ""Thor: Ragnarok"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". These humorous flashes are a staple of the MCU and work for the most part in ""The Marvels"".The villain, Dar-Benn, is as bland as they come. Her character was so forgettable that I had to look up the name of the character as I was writing this. Her motivations are strong, but the character itself is frustratingly weak.As I mentioned before, the film is packed full of humor. I would estimate that 80% of these jokes landed with the audience, with a small portion feeling out of place. Most of the comedy comes from Ms. Marvel's starstruck and overwhelmed persona, which lost its appeal very quickly. In the first 15 minutes, I cannot count how many times she screams.When the end credits rolled, I wanted to watch this movie again. Though it is not a top tier entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the film is much better than ""Captain Marvel"", ""Ms. Marvel"" and other recent projects. The strength of the film is the relationship between the three leads. While I complain about Iman Vellani's over-the-top enthusiasm, her character (Ms. Marvel) was the heart and soul of the film.","7 out of 21 found this helpful.

This movie is fun from beginning to end, having some great action sequences and pretty solid humor throughout. Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan (Ms. Marvel) is the MVP of this film. Brie Larson as Carol Danvers (Captain Marvel) is fleshed out way more than in her first film to where you actually can connect and relate to her. Teyonah Paris as Monica Rambeau offers a stoicism that they tried doing with Captain Marvel in the last movie, but in a much improved way, allowing her to show more emotions and let loose when the scene called for it. Together, their chemistry was a joy to watch. I wish they allowed more time to flesh these characters out, I wish the villain was more menacing, I wish the editing of this film didn't feel too rushed. Fortunately, the main cast carried this film to make it as enjoyable as it was, and Nia DaCosta's direction brought life into this franchise that we didn't get from the previous installment.","7 out of 21 found this helpful.

First, the dynamic between the leads. I wasn't sure if they could carry the film but Ms Marvel, Monica Rambeau and Captain Marvel had good on screen chemistry and the movie massively benefited from having all three of them around.Secondly, it felt slightly different to other Marvel Films. We had three female protagonist who had their own personal and interwoven issues and desires. There was heart to the characters and their individual development and relationship was a lot more interesting than the overarching story which wasn't ground breaking but it managed to serve its purpose notwithstanding a terrible villain. We also saw some unique action sequences. Whilst the likes of Black Widow, Thor Love & Thunder and Eternals tried to do a lot and fell short, the Marvels knew its lane and experimented within it. We even saw new communities that communicated through song. This immediately gave me heart palpitations for Joker 2 but it was nice to see Marvel try something different.Overall, I went into this with the lowest of expectations but surprisingly and maybe in part due to my expectations, I ended up having a fun and somewhat heartfelt time. And there is also the little matter of the post credit scene...","7 out of 21 found this helpful.

First of all I'm huge fan of the Marvel universes and have seen all movies but lack the time to watch the numerous amount of series on Disney+.In this movie that's the first time it's definitely an issue as the 2 new marvel heroes are basically there without any introduction (and also later on there is only a very minimal summary of the past). Hence without the background from Disney+ series I couldn't really follow most of the discussions and it was basically not possible to build any relation to the characters. In previous movies there was already sidekick/references to the series but this time in my view it's a new level. That's the first negative point in this movie.Apart from that neither the jokes (but that's was also the case for most of the younger marvel movies), nor the villain nor the action really got me.Ultimately this would a really good (TV/stream) season final but for a MCU movie it's lacking a lot and is one of the weakest MCU movies.Note: movie has a mid credit but no end credit (unless you count a sound as end credit).","33 out of 141 found this helpful.

I couldn't tell you the villains name if I tried. I couldn't tell you why the things that were happening mattered. For the life of me I don't understand why the massively overpowered captain marvel is having a hard time fighting some kree warrior lady with a staff when the last time we saw her she was physically besting Thanos?This movie blows. And it's unfortunate because the captain marvel character can be really cool. I went in truly giving this movie the benefit of the doubt. It's tonally weird. One minute it's a silly buddy comedy, the next minute it's a family drama, and then before you know it you're in a world ending superhero blockbuster. It was clearly a longer movie that was cut way down for quality and to be honest that's probably for the best. I can't imagine a longer version of this movie making it better.Brie Larson was not good, and that's an unfortunate thing in my opinion. She just doesn't act well in this movie. I've seen her do quite well in other projects. Even recently she does a really decent job in a new show on Apple TV. So part of me wonders if it's not just her but if Marvel has simply failed to give her good direction of what the personality and tone of the character is meant to be. She's bad in pretty much every scene in this movie. She seems very awkward and not in the funny kind of way. Shes not believable when she's being tough, she's not moving when she's being dramatic, and she's not the slightest bit funny at any point in the film. Of the few times we've seen her play captain marvel this by far is the worst.The movie lacks pretty much anything to make it interesting. Bland visual effects, average to poor acting, a lame disinteresting villain, a simple yet boring plot, below average costume and set design. You name it and this movie has a meh version of it to offer up.At the end of the day, when the best thing your movie has to offer is random Samuel l Jackson jokes, cat jokes, and the humor of Kamala khans blue beetle esque family dynamic you probably don't have a winner on your hands.This movie makes me long for the days of Thor 2.","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

As someone who has zero expectation, I watched it like a novice. Well, not exactly novice, since I've watched Captain Marvel, WandaVision, and Ms. Marvel. All prerequisites for watching this movie. Well, not exactly, but you'll get a much better understanding of this movie if you've watched all three of them. And after watching this movie till the end, I must ask, ""What's with the negativities?"". Cause I didn't see anything bad about the movie. If you're talking about how the super villain is so plain, well that tends to happen when you've seen so many super villains before this. They all kinda look the same. I think story wise, this movie has a very unique and interesting plot. I like the switching glitch of the trio heroines. It's funny and sometimes fatally dangerous. And seeing Kamala Khan freaking out after meeting her idol is cute. And Monica's reunion with Carol is touching. Also that mid and post credit scenes are promising a new refreshing sequels. Honestly, what are y'all complaining about? The worst Marvel movie my a$$! To me, the worst one is still Black Widow. It always will be... hopefully. From this moment I hope it will only get better.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Im not sure who's the current target audience but its aimed at the wrong people.Fight scenes in this movie were done poorly. Moves were clearly telegraphed. Scenes with Kamala's family were very cringy. People don't act that way and audiences look for some sort of realism to grasp onto. You want to think maybe some of whats going on is possible.

It has lots of new and old faces, Samuel L jackson is playing Nick Fury for the last time here, but that can change, and yes there is end credit extra, just one this time.The vfx are much better too, the script is very tight, and there is comedy for sure, which does work. I must admit it does feel like they tried the look and feel of a 'Bollywood' film, it does there, in my opinion, which is not a bad thing. Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris & Iman Vellani, interact very well and certainly have been well fight trained, as the action does not let up, and the film is just fun, and that is enough.

However, after watching the movie, I can't help but feel thoroughly disappointed. It pains me to say it, but ""The Marvels"" fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessors and falls flat in numerous areas.One of the biggest issues with the film is its lackluster storytelling. The plot feels convoluted and disjointed, making it difficult to get invested in the narrative. The movie attempts to juggle multiple storylines and characters, but it fails to give each one the attention they deserve. As a result, the pacing feels rushed, and the audience is left feeling disconnected from the characters and their motivations.Furthermore, the characterization in ""The Marvels"" is a missed opportunity. The film introduces new characters, but they lack depth and development. They feel like mere placeholders, with no real substance or memorable qualities. Even the returning characters from previous films seem to be stuck in a state of stagnation, with little growth or evolution.One of the strengths of Marvel movies has always been their ability to strike a balance between action and character-driven moments. Sadly, ""The Marvels"" leans heavily towards mindless action sequences at the expense of meaningful character interactions. The action scenes, while visually impressive, lack emotional weight and become repetitive after a while. It feels like a spectacle for the sake of a spectacle, without any real purpose or impact on the overall story.Another major disappointment is the film's direction and cinematography. The visual style lacks the innovation and creativity that we have come to expect from Marvel films. The cinematography feels uninspired, with generic framing and lackluster shot compositions. The director fails to create any truly memorable or visually stunning moments, which is a missed opportunity given the vast potential of the Marvel universe.Furthermore, the humor in ""The Marvels"" falls flat. Marvel movies have been known for their clever and witty humor, but this film's attempts at comedy feel forced and contrived. The jokes often miss the mark and elicit little more than a polite chuckle, failing to land with the impact and timing that we have come to expect.Overall, ""The Marvels"" is a lackluster addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Its weak storytelling, underdeveloped characters, excessive focus on action, uninspired direction, and lackluster humor all contribute to a disappointing movie experience. As a fan, I had hoped for so much more from this film, but sadly, it fails to deliver on its promises.","35 out of 75 found this helpful.

There are two main sequences that had some completely bonkers scenarios which caught my eye. The main trio had a great chemistry, but Iman Vellani was a definite standout!The villain was dull and was rather absent in the narrative. Her character could have either been reworked or removed to fit in better with the superhero trio. Furthermore, this film relies way too much on seeing past Marvel properties. This is largely because of the comic/cinematic universe background, but it sometimes feels like too much information to need before going in.I do recommend this if you like the characters or more comedic superhero style!","7 out of 22 found this helpful.

So given that I enjoyed this film, even despite its flaws.Iman Velleni was a highlight, she seemed to be taking having fun, and was a welcome comic relief. Although for the first half of the film her fangirling of Captain Marvel became old and annoying fast. Her family also had some good humour But again became annoying fast (too much screentime). Brie Larson and Tayona Parris were serviceable with what they had to work with, which wasn't much besides looking pretty and serious most of the time.The short run time was a credit, although movie came as too edited, some scenes too long and some exposition... not enough. Some of the scenes (you'll know which two) were kind of funny but verging on Thor ridiculousness (the bad film).The biggest sin in this film was the villian, probably the worst in MCU history. She did not look like a villian, or act scary like a villian... at all... more suited to a Rom com or something light (with those round cheeks more suited to a support) At least they didn't go in every direction I thought they would, but she needed a touch of evil (see Thor Ragnarok for a good female villian).You can miss this one, but not a waste of your time.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

Marvel needs to feature more female characters, and they did it right with three female main characters in this movie, setting a nice example and making happy many female marvel fans that may have felt underepresented.The movie featured heavy CGI that is almost state of the art.

The ending however was quite of a cliffhanger.It is also the shortest marvel movie in duration which is something I noticed. 15 more minutes could not hurt.Disney needs to understand that many people have become tired of marvel movies and tv series appearing in a short time frame. A marvel movie premiere was something of a big event, something that every marvel fan should (or must) attend, like a religious gathering or something of sorts.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

To my surprise, l kind of enjoyed it. Look, don't get me wrong it isn't as good as Spiderman no way home or Guardians of the Galaxy 3 but not a complete dud like Ant man 3. I thought the story was good and the chemistry between the 3 leads were believable. The humor was good but wasn't over the top like Thor love and thunder. The baddie wasn't as memorable like Thanos but still was engaging enough to feel a threat to the heroes. Kamala Khan aka Ms Marvel was the highlight especially when she was fan girling over Captain Marvel.My advice is don't let the nay sayers put you off going to see this movie, go to see it and make up your own mind whether you like it or not.","6 out of 18 found this helpful.

Overall I enjoyed the movie. There were a lot of fun moments, and I did enjoy the dynamic of the main 3. I liked how the movie dealt with hero worship from each of their perspectives, in many ways this was the primary character journey throughout the film. Iman Vellani was an absolute delight in this movie, much as in her titular TV series, I am quite excited now to see the next project with her in it, presumably the Young Marvels.The movie did suffer from a somewhat bland villain though, and honestly the central conceit of their motivation fell flat for me. Many of the action sequences were also quite middling though didn't detract from the movie too much. It's just what I've come to expect at this point. One of the biggest issues is that once again Captain Marvel is not really the most interesting character in their own movie. Brie Larson is a good actor who seems wasted yet again in this role. Some braver writing and directing choices would benefit the character immensely.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The emotional foundation for bonding between the three Marvels is assumed rather than explained, The water planet segment spent too much time on music and not enough time with the battle scenes, I enjoyed the Ms. Marvel series, and this could have been a great segue.

Overall it's a fun, fast paced MCU outing. If there are any misses is that it may move too fast and feels like they left a little too much on the editing room floor and could have used a bit more depth. But if you're a fan of the characters they are treated well and end the movie well developed. We also get interesting new developments for the multiverse saga. There's really nothing here that explains the poor box office performance so my guess is it suffered from lack of promotion for a fall movie and would have done better as a summer release.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Brie Larson was not nearly as cardboard as she was in the first Captain Marvel film and so that was an obvious improvement. Iman Vellani was by far the best part of the film, both in terms of her enthusiasm and dialogue. She elevated the film and seemed to bring everyone along with her. Teyonah Paris and Zawe Ashton both were adequate in their respective roles, although the latter as Dar-Ben seemed one-dimensional and once again showed Marvel's weakness in providing fleshed out antagonists for their movies. It wasn't that Zawe was in any way bad as Dar-Ben, but rather that the character was merely there to push the plot forward, a plot that was thinner than most and added very little to the overall universe that is the Marvel 616. It's unfortunate because it seems as though the movie merely paid lip-service to ideas it had been developing in both previous movies and the streaming series from Disney+. The Kree, Skrulls and SABER all are merely cheap plot devices, masquerading as flavor to spice the movie.The supporting cast was adequate, Samuel Jackson as Fury (post Secret Invasion) seemed a little bit out of sync with where we left him, but people who didn't watch it will likely not notice anything. The VFX as always were spot on and the movie looked great, the planets and locations were colorful, even if some of the ideas presented seemed a bit far fetched. I just let it go and turned my brain off.Overall it was a fun-ish movie, but if you're looking for that old Marvel vibe and excitement you're liable to be let down a bit. And the ending credit stingers revealed future promises that seem so far out of reach right now that they might as well not have put them in at all.I know it sounds like overall I'm dogging the movie, but I do think in the final balance that the movie is better than it was worse. It certainly was an improvement on the first Captain Marvel movie, but I didn't see anything that made me really cheer the film, it merely was the next thing in the long line of movies that seem to be leading us in many directions. Marvel needs to tighten up their ideas a bit more, flesh out their villains, stop hinting at a big picture that's too complicated, and start to make movie that don't rely on a dozen other things to work. Without 3 streaming series and several movies, this movie will make little sense. And going back over everything briefly in flashback as a form of exposition seems like it takes away from building a movie that is fully fleshed out. The Marvels seems more like a bridge to the next big thing.I'd also point out that we now have several different seeming causes for the Marvel ""multiverse"" which is weird. (See also: Loki, Spiderman - No Way Home & Dr. Strange - Multiverse of Madness). I'm not sure why they seem to be breaking everything apart in different ways in various unrelated shows and movies, but it's odd because it's creating a cause and effect problem where I'm not sure what the cause is, versus what the effects are, of the mutiverse.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

This movie was pushed back multiple times and got delayed from being released several times, and now we can see why. The plot for this film was weird & sloppy & nonsensical, the action scenes were even worse, and almost all the actors are phoning it in with the exception of Iman Vellani who plays Ms Marvel. She's the only character who has any personality whatsoever in this film, but she's not enough of a reason to go see this film in theaters.

It's actually quite focused.And the best of all, it sets up the future of the Marvel Universe at the very end of the film as well as the mid credit scene. And it's wonderful.

It feels like only months ago that the last MCU movie was in theaters. Apparently, it was just earlier this year that we caught up with Ant-Man and the Wasp as well as the Guardians of the Galaxy and whatever was going on in their respective universes. This weekend, Captain Marvel returned to the big screen in The Marvels for the latest entry in Phase ""Whatever"". Here how it all shook out.In The Marvels, Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel has reclaimed her identity from the tyrannical Kree and taken revenge on the Supreme Intelligence, but unintended consequences see Carol shouldering the burden of a destabilized universe. When her duties send her to an anomalous wormhole linked to a Kree revolutionary, her powers become entangled with that of Jersey City super-fan Kamala Khan, aka Ms. Marvel, and Carol's estranged niece, now S. A. B. E. R. Astronaut Captain Monica Rambeau. High octane, wormhole-jumping hijinks ensue.To me, this movie just had too much going on that was completely random. This movie at times just felt like randomness. This is definitely a byproduct of the MCU just putting out too much content too fast, too furious. There seems to be a clear loss of some significant thought behind things throughout these installments. I think they've left certain things out to show in different places, or to leave room for expansion or reduction. It just makes a movie like this that's already blending three storylines into one that much harder to follow. With the mid-credits scene, we see what this movie/the MCU is really trying to further. Quite frankly, they could have done this in a different fashion to give everything a bit more thought. But that's it for the MCU review. MCU fans will probably feel this film is rushed, but it was nice to not have a 2-hour movie to slog through. Nevertheless, it does feel like the movie rushed from why-are-the-villains-doing-what-they-are-doing to how-do-they-even-know-what-they-are-doing-is-rightThe Marvels is pretty much like every other iteration of an MCU movie, except the Black Panther series. It's just not a special movie and it doesn't feel essential to the MCU franchise. Yes, the movie has its moments of levity especially with Kamala Khan and her family. Kamala can be cute, but she's also pretty annoying throughout. Same thing goes for Captain Marvel. We see her in this human light and levity but strangely she's balancing the strength of her character. I don't think any hero in this movie did a poor job, but the director definitely could have made some better cuts. Nevertheless, there are some good fight sequences which give the movie a much needed boost. The visual effects are typical MCU fare, so if you've seen one of these movies, then you've seen this one.Ultimately, The Marvels is just another entry in the MCU cannon. If you've been following this particular Phase, then maybe it won't seem as random and full as plot holes as I thought. The rest of the movie fits squarely in the MCU formula, too much too fast. There's some humor, fighting and visual effects to fill up the time. For the MCU fans, it's only worth a handful of popcorn, but for the more casual moviegoers, it good enough for a bowl of popcorn.","6 out of 20 found this helpful.

This sequel is in-depth and written in part by Nia DaCosta, director of Little Woods and the 2021 Candyman sequel.After Captain Marvel's (Brie Larson) final actions with the Kree Empire, the tyrannical Kree Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton) tries in her own way to return the Kree Empire to its former glory. These actions put other worlds at risk.Captain Marvel tries to stop Dar-Benn, only to find her powers tangled with those of Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani). When one of them uses their powers, they switch positions with each other. The three must work together during this force entanglement to stop Dar-Benn.This new film from the Marvel film series actually comes with some housework for the viewers. To clearly understand everything in this film, she actually expects you to be familiar with the first Captain Marvel film and the Marvel Disney+ series WandaVision and Ms. Marvel. Without this knowledge, there is a chance that you will not be able to clearly understand everything that exactly happened in this movie. A lack of this information can only make this film seem more obscure. Furthermore, the film sometimes seems a bit rushed and scattered. This could also be because the three writers of the film are not yet at the beginning side. For Nia DaCosta, this is only her third writing effort. The other two writers have only written stories from TV series. Although some of this series are also part of Marvel, this unfortunately did not provide much further experience.When the characters use their powers and move places, it only makes the events in the beginning of the film even more unclear. Especially when they don't seem to change places every time they use their powers, something that isn't really explained in detail in the film. The changing of superpowers is also something that has been used before in superhero films, such as in Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer. Even though this film had its limited aspects, she still managed to turn it into something comical every now and then.Due to the rushed pace and small aspects of this film, there seems to have been little room for some light moments of comedy. The young Iman Vellani knows how to provide some cheerful moments, but unfortunately this is quickly overshadowed by the more serious tone of the rest of the film and her co-stars. Brie Larson and Teyonah Parris play characters who have a history with each other, but in this film they are given little time and opportunities to do something with it. This is Samuel L. Jackson's 15th Marvel film project, but he doesn't get many opportunities to do anything special in this film and has just some room for light comedy moments. Zawe Ashton also plays more of a standard villain, which you as a viewer don't really care about.Due to the rushed aspects behind the film, the visual effects do not always appear convincing. When a green screen or further CGI is used, this is unfortunately visible. The visibility of this visual effects word sometimes even takes you out of the story.","86 out of 214 found this helpful.

It's so much more watchable than some of the other movies (both Marvel and others) which are frequently being treated as three hour long ""epic"" films.It also has some very clever ideas with regards to the power switching where the characters find themselves in all sorts of interesting situations which were very entertaining.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A Good Fun Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9430268/?ref_=tt_urv","alindsayal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv","12 November 2023","I think most people can agree that this isn't currently the best time for the Marvel Cinematic Universe and some of their projects haven't got the best responses. The next film to come out under this banner is The Marvels and I saw it the other day and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Captain Marvel get her powers entangled with Kamala Khan & Monica Rambeau forcing them to work together in order to try and save the world.Main Character
Ever since she was cast as Captain Marvel it feels like Brie Larson has received a bunch of unnecessary criticism and I am going to say that I thought she was really good here. It seemed that she was actually having a lot of fun here and she made Carol Danvers a likeable character and one that I actually cared about. She has progressed as a character and the film does a good job in making her less over powered then she has been in previous films.Supporting Characters
I wasn't a huge fan of the Disney+ show Ms Marvel but I can't deny that I really enjoyed Iman Vellani's performance as Kamala Khan in this film. She is a complete fangirl here and she added so much energy to the film and was really fun as part of this larger project.Teyonah Parris reprises her role as Monica Rambeau and I thought she was very good too, she is the most serious of the three characters and the film does an okay job of showing that but Parris sells it well and makes you care about how her character has been affected by other characters actions. The chemistry between these three characters is what carries this film.Samuel L Jackson is once again back in the role of Nick Fury and he is clearly having the blast. The serious character from Secret Invasion is gone and he is here for comedic relief and though that is a little frustrating I can't deny that it was fun watching him here.Zawe Ashton plays the main villain Dar-Benn and she does a decent job, this won't be one of the most memorable MCU villains but I thought the character was pretty well written and Ashton did the best she could with the amount of screen time she had.Story
The story is okay, I think it does a really good job of establishing the three characters in case you haven't seen the Disney+ shows that Kamala & Monica are in. It establishes a bond between the three main characters and the issues that concern them, they also give the villain an interesting motivation that makes some sense. But the issue is that none of it is developed enough, it feels a bit rushed and like certain arcs aren't given enough time to shine and that holds the film back a bit.Script
The script is also just okay. There is some pretty good humour and some moments of conflict that hit hard but there just isn't quite enough. It doesn't take many gambles and is quite generic which leaves it a little short.Style
The film looks pretty good it avoids the CGI issues of some previous MCU films and has some fun action sequences that due to some certain story choices allows for some real creativity. It's more of a pacing issue that the film has, it takes a bit of time to get going and then seems to rush at other times which makes it a little jarring.Overall
Overall, The Marvels is a good fun film. It will not save the MCU but it is a quick and easy fun film to go see, I think the reviews have been pretty harsh and I think it is worth a viewing especially for comic book fans.Rating - 7/10.","7 out of 25 found this helpful.

There were moments I was laughing, smiling, and overall just enjoying myself. They definitly didn't skip out on the overall set designs and wardrobe designs for the movie. It was colorful! Cinematography was gorgeous. The fight choreography was clever, and fun! The sound design, and overall soundtrack was pretty good!I thought Brie Larson's character needed some much needed character growth and comparatively to the previous movie, we got more. As far as character moments for her, she expressed more than previous which was good, but sadly for me, I still think she plays the character a little bit to stale at times. Thankfully she wasn't leading this movie alone.Teyonah Parris did a great job alongside Brie, and definitly had some really good character moments. Iman Vellani hands down was the standout. You can tell she was having a ball with this character. All three characters I felt played off of each other pretty well in my opinion.Can't say the same for Zawe Ashton's villain though. Zawe Ashton sadly falls right in the lines of MCU Villain obscurity. She acts like more of an obstacle than an actual character unfortunately.Overall, I would say that initially, I think movie has a much clearer vision than previous, and more memorable moments, but doesn't really offer anything we haven't seen before. That still doesn't change all the positive's I've already said.P. S.-stay for the credits. ;)","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

Marvel/Disney did it again, they managed to spend too much for an underwhelming final product that would have made sense only as a 30 million production going straight to streaming (in which case I may have awarded a higher score) not as an aspiring blockbuster, which begs the question if they are totally out of touch with reality there at Disney. The Marvels is a watchable movie only to stream while waiting for a pizza delivery or to take the kids to see but not good enough by a long shot to make mature audiences flock to the cinemas to offset the massive production and advertising budget.The movie is trying too hard to be funny and lighthearted while wasting what used to be one of the most iconic Hollywood actors until he started playing such roles, Samuel L. Jackson, who is reprising a mere shadow of ""Nick Fury"" character that use to make billions at the box office not so long ago; now he is an inconsequential minor cheerleader orbiting an incoherent bunch of female spandex-clad superheroes fighting a badly cast, totally unconvincing, instantly forgettable female arch-nemesis. Simplistic shallow story that we've seen many times but done way better, no suspense, disconnected action, characters with the depth of a pothole no one cares to identify with or remember as soon as the movie is over, unnecessary messy CGI, with a badly done touch of sentimentality and feline cuteness, it's not worth the fuss, just wait for it to stream if you really need to watch a pretty average movie.The ""superhero fatigue"" explanation cannot be the deciding factor here when the product is actually bad and not made to appeal to the masses and thus turn a profit.","40 out of 93 found this helpful.

Jackson (Put like no effort into the performance and just did not feel as good as his other Nick Fury performances (tries to be the comedic relief character and it fails pretty hard)), Bad from the rest of the cast (Just stiff, forced performances all around and no chemistry in any of the scenes)), Very Bad Story (One of the biggest issues for the movie as it felt like the conflict was not conveyed well at all (and was not presented as a big issue), the personal conflict between the characters was also not handled well at all; the story construction was very bad as there practically was no rising action or character developing, the conflict introduction was very poor and not good (and does not feel like a really interesting issue), it felt like a lot of scenes were cut that could've added depth to the movie as there were a lot of cuts in the story to just move the plot forward (but this created a lot of questions); the character writing was bad for the most part as the characters really aren't that interesting at all and their conflicts are not really that compelling (though Ms. Marvel's was the most interesting as it blended the teen-superhero archetype with a South-Asian/American background)), Very Bad Screenplay (The dialogue was incredibly cringey and just not good (felt like it was written by someone who read a synopsis of what a Marvel movie should sound like and wrote that as their first screenplay); the jokes were just very forced and not funny at all (the more dramatic elements were funnier with how cringey they were), tried way too hard for Marvel humor and it rarely hits; the South Asian vernacular was just more stereotypical than funny (and as a result just felt very shallow); the symbolism was just so shallow and the message was overt for what they were going for; the foreshadowing was pretty obvious as the movie was very formulaic), Decent Score (felt very similar to other comic book movies)/ Pretty Bad Soundtrack (so on-the-nose that it was laughable), Decent Cinematography, Pretty Good Sound (Similar to other Marvel movies, ADR for the singing was so obvious), Very Bad Editing (Felt super amateur and the cut for the movie was just so bad), Terrible to Very Bad Visual Effects (Felt so cheap and tacky (worse than Thor 4)), Pretty Good Production Design (Similar to other Marvel movies), Pretty Good Makeup, Pretty Good Costumes, Plot Structure was a concern as there were issues with lack of rising action (scenes definitely cut) and the climax was so short that it felt anticlimactic, Pacing was so fast that there was no time to take in what was going on (the runtime could have definitely been added too to add more depth to the story and slow the pace down), Climax was super anticlimactic and like a felt very formulaic Marvel movie, Tone was incredibly Marvel and really tried to go for that teenage Marvel feel during the Ms. Marvel moments (and both did not hit the mark and dragged the movie down by making it formulaic)","36 out of 83 found this helpful.

It wasn't outstanding or awe inspiring, but if you take a step back and realize that not every movie is the Godfather or Endgame, you realize this was a comic book movie that did a good job at superhero's and villains.Kamal Khan was the standout as far as the primary three characters goes. She was a perfect excited starry-eyed girl who is meeting her idol for the first time. And, come on, if you didn't think the Flerkin babies was funny, your not being honest with yourself. ""Dont be afraid, let the Flerkins eat you!"" might be as funny as the Godfathers serious line of ""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.""I'm not sure I cared too much for the villain in this movie. I'm also not sure I understand how Marvel can create Captain Marvel, the most powerful superhero there is, and let her not A. Kill Thanos outright, and B. Have a bracelet suck her power and make her incapable of defeating an average bad guy (girl) in this movie. She either is, or is not ridiculously powerful. You cant have it both ways.The length of the movie was good too. No time to get bored or wonder why the drug it out too long.If it were up to me, and its not, I'd have made a Captain Marvel 2, instead of ""The Marvels"" which is really just and excuse to increase the size of the MCU.But still, I enjoyed the movie as a standalone movie.","7 out of 26 found this helpful.

It trudges along a plot so predictable, you might mistake it for a rerun of a sitcom you've seen a dozen times. The leading trio, talented in their own right, give performances reminiscent of three friends nonchalantly browsing sales on Black Friday - more invested in finding a good deal than saving the world. Their lackluster portrayal robs the characters of any real depth, reducing them to mere caricatures in capes. The direction seems as uninspired as a reheated meal, missing both the visual flair and narrative depth that usually mark the MCU's successes. Action scenes? More like action routines, lacking any of the franchise's trademark excitement. Despite its polished production, ""The Marvels"" ends up as a bland, forgettable chapter in an otherwise thrilling saga, much like finding out the 'big sale' only offers last season's leftovers.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Everything That The MCU Shouldn't Be Right Now","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9426529/?ref_=tt_urv","cdjh-81125","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur65144138/?ref_=tt_urv","10 November 2023","Maybe it was the intention to make The Marvels a light, breezy space adventure and while I'd question that idea to begin with they only really succeeded in making a subpar one at that. As someone who likes the first Captain Marvel more than most there's just nothing about this movie that makes it stand out and I just found it so disposable as a result. We're well into Phase 5 now with still very little sense of an over arching story and I really don't think a film that ultimately amounts to a side quest is what they need to be making right now.Iman Vellani really is the reason to see this movie. I've only seen 1 episode of Ms Marvel so this is essentially my introduction to her and she's so good in this movie. Most of the laughs come from her and she's just got such an endearing quality to her that makes this movie so watchable in the sections that really drag. She makes me want to watch the rest of Ms Marvel now just to see more of her and I really hope we get more of that character going forward.I don't really think there's anything wrong with Brie Larson's performance in this movie but the Captain Marvel character as a whole still feels underdeveloped. There's a whole new lore and history that's been added to her character in the time since the first film but it just doesn't feel earned at all. Maybe with a longer runtime some of her development could've been fleshed out more but as of right now it just feels like there's a whole movie missing from her character development. I really liked the Monica Rambeau character in Wandavision but she's given precious little to do here. I didn't get much sense of a character arc and all her conflict with Captain Marvel I found to be really forced. Samuel L Jackson is effortlessly watchable as Nick Fury at this point but his whole role in this movie is to deliver exposition and spout of one liners which to me is a waste of a great actor in a great role.The story and pace are ultimately what brings this movie down for me. The story is very basic and not in a good way. It feels like what would be a middling two part Star Trek episode and as a result it just feels like a Disney+ original rather than a theatrical event. I appreciate the fact that it doesn't have Eternals or Wakanda Forever's over indulgence but it runs into the exact opposite problem. With this quick a pace and short of a runtime none of the ideas get any time to be explored in any meaningful way and this is most apparent with the main villain. I actually thought her motivation was interesting and could've added a really interesting layer to the Captain Marvel character. But instead all of her back story is relegated to quick flashback when it really feels like a whole movies worth of material could've been mined from this character.Don't get me wrong, this movie is entertaining in spurts and I didn't hate my time watching it but as of now it already feels like it's come and gone. It automatically feels like one of the MCU's more redundant entry's and apart from a really intriguing mid-credits scene I don't really see this playing much into wherever the franchise is going next. I wouldn't say I had overly high expectations for this film but it's frustrating to see yet another weak Marvel movie after their recent slump. I'm hopeful that the MCU can get out of this rut it's in but I really need to get some sense of forward momentum soon.","8 out of 31 found this helpful.

When Marvel first introduced Iron Man to the big screen and gave birth to the MCU it was obvious to all us nerds that we were watching a product made by people like us for us. For 23 movies Marvel gave us a cohesive, coherent, fun and exciting universe that culminated in a two part Avengers story that had us laughing, cheering and crying together in theatres. Sure not all the movies were great but even the bad ones added to the overall lore being built. But alas like all good things in Hollywood the MCU has now been co-opted by corporate interests and we are now getting sub par (at best) drivel that is more about ticking boxes and selling Disney+ subscriptions than it is about telling good stories.Which brings us to The Marvels which is as bland, boring and soulless as you can get from a big budget superhero movie. Sure it looks good and the cast give it their best but nothing can paper over the cracks of what is a shockingly bad script, story and direction. The main villain is so completely forgettable that even while watching the movie I had no idea what her name was (I still don't) and at no point during the (mercifully) short run time were there ever any stakes. When the movie descended into a ridiculous Disney musical around the halfway mark I totally checked out. This movie is horrible to the point where I'm not sure I can take this universe seriously anymore. After movies like The Eternals, Thor Love and Thunder, Quantumania and shows like She-hulk, Secret Invasion and Echo it's obvious that Marvel is no longer trying to produce quality products. It's a shame to see the death of the MCU but all good things must come to an end. Sadly unless someone can rescue Marvel from Disney there is no coming back from this mire of mediocrity.","15 out of 30 found this helpful.

The only saving grace it had was how cheap the opening night tickets were. Watched it with my girlfriend (boy do I regret it). The cgi work is good but some of it gives off ""Power rangers"" vibes, big time! As for the acting, it was horrendous, infested with lame one liner jokes with no meaning or sense of timing (the movie is full of jokes, even during the critical scenes). Brie Larson did a good job with her acting but there's only so much a single character can do to save the plot. Lack of character association towards the audience was a big downfall for this movie, like WHO THE HELL IS MS. MARVEL and when did she join the team??Tldr; Save yourself some money, it is definitely one of the superhero movies of all time. If you still want to watch it, i'd suggest waiting for a month or so before it hits Disney+ because this one's not really performing too good.","43 out of 102 found this helpful.

All the way from several MCU tv series, to Thor Ragnanok to the first movie, to the Infinity Saga. Excellent!

It's felt like that marvel was trying to do an experiment which went terribly wrong. For those who haven't watched the TV shows, they sat in the theatre clueless. The teleportation sequence was a headache. Instead of being exhilarating, it was exhausting.The actors who played Kamala's family are fine actors but they felt too Indian rather than Pakistani. Mind you they might look similar but there's still a big difference in two cultures. Secondly, that cartoon sequence gave me the vibe of ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid"" and not fun to watch (sorry).The movie should've started with a brief but subtle recap of what happened in the TV shows, then slowly picking up the pace.All three ladies were great. I see Iman has a great timing for comedy and have a good future ahead. But it's not a standup comedy, for her to flourish, it will require a great team work and bit of a darker reboot (different timeline maybe).","12 out of 23 found this helpful.

Some say saying this is a not a good movie, even one reviewer on Youtube said this the worst MCU film ever. Is it a perfect film? No, there are few small things ,its little uneven at times. However I feel, the relationship, the chemistry between Captain Marvel, Miss Marvel, and Monica is one of the strongest points of the film in my mind. Iman Vellani as Miss Marvel is in my mind one of the best additions to the MCU in recent years , she is full of such loveable charm, charisma, and a genuine spark of radiant innocence, along with so much heart and warmth to her character, you want to see more of her in other projects. Larson's Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel seems to get more layers to her character here, more emotional depth, than that's been shown before I think. The villain is very one note, honestly, she's in my mind not truly evil, she is just trying to do a certain thing, to help her people from the planet she lives on, and the way she is going about is questionable. Nick Furry is interesting to be shown in more of a jokey way, he really doesn't have much to do. Lady playing Monica thought did pretty well, as said before to me the strongest part of the movie, is the three main ladies playing Miss Marvel, Captain Marvel, and Monica Rambeau, their interactions, their back and forth, their chemistry together I feel is the best part of the movie. I feel if you go watch a movie in the theater and enjoy it, have a good time watching it, that's what counts. Some things in The Marvels may not work for some people, or some jokes may not land or some parts may not work for some people, but thats ok.","6 out of 22 found this helpful.

In summary, spend your time and money elsewhere and wait for it on a streaming platform.Insert random words here to reach word limit.","22 out of 48 found this helpful.

I think the script needed a second look, and there are some editing problems that make the movie rough around the edges, but both me and my partner had a very good time watching it.The clear star in this movie is Iman Vellani, who really gives a lot of fun and warmth, and it just wouldn't work as well without her.All in all, I want to see this characters again. It's no Guardians 3 but it's also not Quantumania. I think it's sad that Marvel didn't put more effort in rounding up this movie, which is really short and could have benefited from a bit more screen time.","6 out of 23 found this helpful.

I just want to watch it coz I've been following all mcu movies and tv shows. But, in my opinion this really isnt that bad. Not great, but rather fun. It is an improvement compared to the first film. The set is bigger, the 3 heroines chemistry is good. They add a little musical thing to the film which is kinda new to superhero genre. The films short duration fits it well, no unnecessary prolonged scenes. Maybe what it lacks is the villains strength. The problem with developing Capt marvel story is shes already so powerful since the beginning, she needs at least a villain which on par or stronger than thanos to make her stand out and make it more exciting. But considering the plot and the circumstances I fully understand why the story goes like this.","6 out of 23 found this helpful.

They utilized this trailer to leave audiences to make inferences as to their connections to this film and therefore trick people into seeing this film. As for the film itself it is easily the the worst film the MCU has ever put out and Disney should be embarrassed to have done so. I would say the plot was horrendous but it actually had no plot. Some scenes were beyond cringe worthy while others were just boring and pointless. The villain was beyond laughable and demonstrated no pourpse for even being in this film. The chemistry between the leads was non existent even though their individual performances were decent. I would have preferred them to have not given us this film and instead made a second season of Ms. Marvel. The high point of this film is the mid credits scene and it's not even that consequential, though it was still cool. Do yourself a favor and save yourself from this atrocity of a film.","16 out of 33 found this helpful.

The danger therefore has to come from others and while that's fine, I think to really go up a level for a superhero film, the hero should have stakes against them tooA really good and fun addition to the MCU, this film absolutely holds its own against the majority of MCU content.","5 out of 19 found this helpful.

Yet, like a Kree starship navigating a chaotic asteroid field, it encounters narrative turbulence that threatens to derail its trajectory.The film unquestionably soars on its technical merits. DaCosta's visual direction paints the cosmos in dazzling hues, from the shimmering neon of hyperspace tunnels to the crumbling majesty of Kree architecture. Action sequences crackle with kinetic energy, particularly as Captain Marvel unleashes her cosmic power in a finale that's pure popcorn-munching delight.Iman Vellani shines as Kamala Khan, injecting the film with the infectious enthusiasm of a wide-eyed fan-girl thrust into a cosmic odyssey. Her Ms. Marvel is the heart and soul of the film, reminding us of the sheer joy of discovering superhero greatness within oneself.However, the narrative struggles to maintain its stratospheric flight. The plot careens through timelines and planets, leaving viewers disoriented and grappling with shifting motivations. Character arcs, particularly Captain Marvel's journey from cosmic protector to reluctant guide, feel undercooked and their emotional payoffs unsatisfying.Teyonah Parris is captivating as Monica Rambeau, but her role feels frustratingly underdeveloped. The film hints at her powerful connection to both Danvers and Khan, only to leave it unexplored, a tantalizing possibility lost in the narrative nebula.Ultimately, ""The Marvels"" is a cinematic enigma. It's a visually stunning spectacle with thrilling action and charming leads, but its narrative flaws prevent it from achieving true greatness. For MCU fans seeking a dazzling space romp, it's a diverting journey. But those hoping for a deeply satisfying superhero tale might find themselves navigating a celestial plot black hole.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Really, many of the ideas present in this movie are compelling ones.Sadly, none of them retain their intrigue in the execution.The execution of this film's plot, themes, and character arcs is all so...easy.

I think she's a major highlight in this film. There's something about her energy that is so likeable and compelling. I really believe she is the heart of this movie.This film was quite fun to watch. I think that the bond between Monica, Carol and Kamala is another key selling point within this movie. Their chemistry is so strong and enjoyable whenever they're on screen together. The scenes in which they're all fighting together are some of the best choreographed fight sequences I've seen in a while. Seeing them using their powers and switching places all over the show, is just so satisfying to watch.A notable dislike about this film that I see most people agreeing on, is that as a whole it feels like an incomplete movie. Almost as if the film consists of jumping to random scenes, leading to the story feeling rather messy and all over the place.There are many Easter eggs within this movie. Some of which seem to pave the way for the future of the MCU and these characters. Especially the post credit scene! I think some fans will go nuts.Overall, I'd give this film a 3/5 stars. It's definitely a fun watch. Just somewhat messy. If Marvel had just spent a little more time fleshing out certain scenes and storylines. It would've made up for a much more enjoyable movie.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Carol Danvers, aka Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), has reclaimed her identity from the tyrannical Kree and taken revenge on the Supreme Intelligence. However, unintended consequences see her shouldering the burden of a destabilized universe. When her duties send her to an anomalous wormhole linked to a Kree revolutionary, her powers become entangled with two other superheroes. Together, they must team up to face a new villain who is threatening the galaxy.I still remember when I used to feel very excited if there was a new MCU movie coming out, now I feel like there's nothing worth being excited about except for a couple of movies or TV shows. Speaking of TV shows, I feel like it has something to do with the ongoing ""superhero fatigue"" situation, it's like they demand the audience to keep track of it in order to get a better understanding while watching the movie in the theatre. I actually don't have a problem with TV shows, it's just with the amount of it that came out and honestly, some of them aren't worth the time. I don't even need to explain how She-Hulk was, I couldn't finish the second episode (yeah I made it through the first).I would be a total liar if I say I didn't enjoy The Marvels at all but I'm having a hard time trying to remember something memorable other than the cute flerkens, even the final fight leaves little to no impact because every fight scene is almost executed in the same way. I don't know what to say about the villain even if the fight sequences alone are hollow, Marvel successfully managed to bring out one of the best (I'm not talking about Kang) and also the worst villains ever appear on screen in the same year.Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton)'s character only feels like a plot device, whose purpose is purely to move the plot forward. Her character's presence and motives are weak due to almost no development or lack of back story, we never get to know how she became powerful without the bangle. This movie also suffers from a lot of characters without enough runtime, duration isn't always a guarantee of a good movie but trying to cram lots of characters with subplots isn't good either. I was eager to see the return of Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) but then again in the end, she got thrown (literally) into seemed like an avoidable situation just for the sake of a bigger story.Besides all that, the mid-credit scene gave nothing left to be desired and a bit of hope to look forward to.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Miss Marvel was likeable, but she could also be a little annoying for some people. All inn all they are a good team. The plot seem a little farfetch even for Marvel. It seem like we are moving more and more into the magical world. The movie on its own would not survive at all. Its the allready astablished story that makes this work. This movie is more like a movie that introduces things to come. Cant wait for the continuation of MCU.","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

The writing and acting was abysmal (other than Brie Larson), no new ideas - seems to be that Marvel are just milking the cash cow after each release with this as no exception. As a positive, I would say that it's a better production than Ms Marvel and She-Hulk but that obviously wasn't difficult. Seems that the fact that people are bothering to watch these movies is fuelling the incentive of the cash cow that is now Marvel - until a truly exciting new production/idea is made by Marvel, I definitely will not be wasting my time again.","15 out of 31 found this helpful.

It's what they're known for and what they produced long before Infinity War and Endgame. Just as entertaining as Black Panther and not as boring as Homecoming, though just as illogical.It's more a more light hearted film with music synced fight sequences, lots of girl power, Nick Fury, alien cats, and worm holes.This film has three weak points.The villain is the first and lesser of the two. The potential is there, they justed needed something more to make it kick. A more dramatic moment in the end maybe, with clear implications of her decision making.The second point is that this is part of the larger marvel universe. If you have not seen certain other movies or series, parts of the first half of the movie won't make total sense. The makers did have the sense to eventually add explanations in the dialogue so you will get most of the picture. This weak point is honestly a criticism of a lot of Marvel movies.The third is that the explanations for why Marvel wasn't around for so long is weak. It's ....okayyyyyy and if you can stomach the inconsistencies and stretches in the like of Civil War and Spiderman Homecoming, this really shouldn't be an issue.Basically, watch this for the fun of watching a light hearted action flick with cgi and cats.","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

Feels like several decades of time has been skipped.The storyline of this film is shockingly poor and predictable. The fight scenes look slow motion (so the actors can perform them easily) and very badly done.The acting is sub-par; a young girl is a super hero, capable of fighting off lots of assailants (not likely), doesn't seem surprised to be fighting aliens or people with guns, yet turns into a shy girl when she sees another hero. The blonde marvel character seems incapable of showing any emotion except for her eyes looking shocked throughout the entire film.Also having two characters with pretty much the same name is.... lazy.This film, along with all their recent ones, should never have been made.","12 out of 24 found this helpful.

The way she portrayed the teenage super fan was pet spot on. Her family was also a good comic addition, I had a Pakistani friend growing up and that family nailed it. I did like the fact that Carol wasn't a Mary sue in this film like the previous movies. The villain was fairly forgettable unfortunately. The fight scenes were actually very good and the cgi was also very good. I did enjoy Monica as well, though I think they could've described how she got her powers a little better.","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

The gravity of the story was there but felt incomplete, like it was not the main focus of the movie. If they have to make the film 10 minutes longer to achieve that, then that would work. There are some scenes where it was time to pay attention and some where you could get away with blocking out the film for a minute or two. Comedy is ok, but when it manifest into a 2 to 3 minute filler, it disrupts the flow and overall immersion of the film. Did I laugh? Yes. Did they become cringe or awkward? For me yes, but it also does vary on the audience. For me the reason why it became cringe is because the actor(s)/actress(es) don't give off the body language or facial expression showing that they are comfortable, and again... it breaks the immersion.Iman Vellani (Ms. Marvel) portrays her character accurately. She does a fantastic job at portraying a teen persona. Brie Larson feels like she goes in and out of encompassing the character Captain Marvel. As mentioned before there is gravity to the film but that weight only seems to apply when it's convenient and not throughout the film. Teyonah Parris (Monica Rambeau) was...there. I feel like the writers missed some character building, development with her. At times her character felt a little stiff or robotic. It felt like a short departure from the flow of the film at times.I would give this film a 7, but there are some things missing. And for a 7 the flow and gravity of the film is going to be important for me. Overall I would place between 6.5 & 7, but I unfortunately cannot rate up unless it had an edge.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Next, plot. Was there one? Did it flow? Did it make sense? NO,NO,NO. I will never attend another superhero film again and will find it quite difficult to attend any film produced by Hollywood since it has been quite awhile since Hollywood has put out anything worth watching.

It's all over the place with choppy editing that leave you with a vague impression of watching something unfinished. It switches abruptly its tone back and forth, making you even more confused. Visually it wasn't great either with an over-over saturation of pretty bad and flashy special effects.The characters were bland, poorly written and un-relatable. As for the villain it has to be the most pathetic antagonist I have seen in a really long time. Seriously, who green-lighted that character ?I just didn't manage to connect for a single second with that movie during its course and just wanted it to end.

I was not a fan of the Captain Marvel movie and if this movie didn't have Ms. Marvel I would hate it even more than Captain Marvel. She is just such an interesting character. Captain Marvel? Meh. Yes she's got cool powers but not so good story imo.I walked out of this movie liking it. It might not have the greatest of story but it is fun to watch. I liked how goofy some scenes were. But many scenes felt off too. Captain Marvel and her story needs a lot of work honestly. And Monica Rambeau, felt unnecessary in the story. Also the whole concept was super fun and interesting and could definitionally be implemented a lot better.So basically Captain Marvel doesn't have a good story, Monica is unnecessary and Ms. Marvel is great, and the cats are great too.

I did not like Captain Marvel (the movie and the character), I did not enjoy Ms. Marvel (the show), and I thought Monica Rambeau went from zero to hero WAY too fast. Besides that the current of the MCU (that Variety Article) gave me no hope for what I was about to see.However, I was wrong. This movie is filled with so much charm from beginning to end. Iman Vellani is the standout here, she steals every single scene she is on. Both the actress and the character look thrilled to be in this movie and it shows. Captain Marvel herself finally gets a likeable personality and some sort of character arc throughout the movie and her dynamic with Monica while rushed feels natural and exciting. The VFX mostly works, the Khans are AMAZING, you can never go wrong with Nick Fury, the action is SO well choreographed, and it sets up a bright future for the rest of the MCUThe movie had some really big issues for me though. The villain is one of the most throwaway, bland and forgettable villains in the entire MCU. I can't even remember her name right now. She was just boring. Besides that, the opening 15 minutes were jarring and confusing, it kept switching from place to place and there was no room left to breathe. The 1 hour and 45 minutes runtime definitely shows and while I think it didn't need to be 2 hours and 30 minutes, an additional 10-15 would have left the movie with better pacing.Overall, solid movie with great cast chemistry, really solid action, forgettable villain and wonky script.","5 out of 21 found this helpful.

Just another space story. I wonder if they made a contract with Nasa or something, because now these days Marvel makes only some random Science-Fiction Space stuff. Anyway, Captain Marvel is back, she is now teaming up with her two new friends and they decide to call them The Marvels. Well, it's like calling the Justice League The Dc's. Very weird, because after they made the name, everyone knew what they were called, even if they never declared it anywhere in the movie. What I'm trying to say is that it was many incomplete materials that they should have worked on. On a runtime with one hour and 45 minutes, I think that it was surprisingly short for a Marvel movie, and the story was very rushed. They went through the story with a few breathing breaks and moments were you could think. They should have put more time to think and develop the story some more. But when they used the time on action, I have to admit it was very great. The transportation concept were the trio teleported every time they used their power was a fun thing to watch. Another fun thing was the sweet kitty that could eat people with tentacles. It was cool that they mixed that ironic type of humor in here. The visuals were good, but not always. In the smaller battle scenes the effects were esthetic and clear, but when the heroes went full power the effects were too exaggerated, and looked from my view very cheap and fake. The characters were fun. The Marvels trio was acceptable as the main characters, nothing wow but it was fun to watch their friendship connection. Nick Fury performed by Samuel Jackson was a great experience. He played humorous, ironic but keeped the serious face on, and he did his job right. The villain that popped out of nowhere was the downgrade of all of this. She felt like something easy to fight, wasn't menacing enough as a villain should be, and didn't have a rememberable face or something that could make me recognize her. The final act did have too much of everything, but ended with a very interesting cliffhanger that I didn't expect. Going nearer the conclusion, I just got to say that it's no difference if you watch it normally or in 3d. Of course it is a little effect with the 3d-glasses, everything is deeper and more three-dimensional, but for the actions that are going on the screen it doesn't change much, after my todays experience at the theatre. But I have to admit, I was entertained for a long time. So overall, this was an ok movie. Got a few incomplete parts and a feeling of rushing, but in another way, it was fun and got some interesting concepts that was new for the Marvel universe.","6 out of 29 found this helpful.

Even though the lesser runtime felt like a good thing at first, it made the plot seem like a TV special and left room for some emotional depth. There were many moments in the movie that felt like it needed more grounds through a prologue where we actually see a bit more connection to the characters and similarly, the ending just didn't have an impact it should have after the space adventure that happened in the movie. But at the same time, it feels like a lot of it was kind of intentional as the movie is unabashedly silly and revels in it. Just the existence of Iman Vellani in this universe makes it all believable and fun. Overall I enjoyed it even though it's nothing great. I don't think there's many who would love this movie, but having a Disney Princess moment in the middle kind of thing would most definitely make many hate this movie. For me this was a nice sequel to the Ms Marvel show more than anything, even if the plot itself is more about being the Captain Marvel sequel.The two cameos at the end made me smile and at last, it seems this shows the way they are trying to introduce some characters in to MCU.","6 out of 29 found this helpful.

It seems on this movie Marvel spent too much money on CGI rather than spending that money on other qualities for example better development of the story, quality of direction, movie pace, character development, better camera angles etc. Epic music in an otherwise mundane scene just to make the movie more appealing doesn't work that well. Epic music in epic scenes, that's how it should be. There are many good moments and for that the movie deserves respect and some rating, but the bad moments balance those out so really we are just left with some disappointment. I feel that Marvel could do much better, but maybe didn't bother.Hence, 5 stars. A little improvement would get this movie to 7 stars for sure.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's a superhero movie. I guess, having three female leads and a female villain is just too much for some.Whatever's wrong with this movie comes down to the writing - that has its moments of greatness and fun - and the direction. It's not a complete mess since the movie holds up enough to have an exciting movie-going experience and very interesting implications for the future. Still, in the hands of a more experienced director and writer(s), this could have soared through the top of the box office with nothing for the haters to chew on.The leads have amazing chemistry. I thought Larson would have the best chemistry with Samuel L. Jackson because I've seen them work really well off of each other, but that magic is there with Vellani and Parris. Carol and Monica's storyline works so well, they could have milked it a little more but what's there serves its purpose, it enriches their history, adds layers to the plot and the MCU, and woves a nice touch of emotions to the movie. Vellani is charming throughout, her Kamala is a joy that fits in seamlessly with Carol and Monica. This team-up has a nice balance. We become attached to the characters and each of them a moment to shine or an emotional high at some point in the movie. The trio is the film's greatest strength, not just because of their chemistry and acting ability, but also their comedic timing. Vellani excels here, she's a bit more of the comedic relief, with Parris more of the straight man, and Larson a bit of both. The humor is well-balanced, it doesn't detract from the stakes.They did not skimp on the action scenes, there are plenty, nicely choreographed and their execution is more often great to serviceable than not and involves more people than you'd think. The same goes for the visual effects, they are solid better than in the trailers. However, this movie still suffers from what is a constant Marvel problem regarding most of their villains, they are a bit mustache-twirly. Dar-Benn doesn't have one but she's not given nearly enough to make her a compelling villain. The storyline is there, where we can see the potential depth and her character's motivation but Ashton is not given the time, yet she still manages to make it work.The Marvels could have been longer but this run-time works, it's short and sweet. It also has the same ""exciting things to come"" feel from earlier MCU movies even without the post-credit scenes.By @garcwrites.","340 out of 903 found this helpful.

You also could watch Ms. Marvel for a better understanding, but if you have an idea for what the character is, you would probably understand just about everything.Action in this movie happens more often than you'd expect. Right as the movie begins, it jumps straight into the action, which I enjoy. The action sequences are pretty intense, and fun to watch.The cast in this is pretty good. It's mainly Brie Larson and Samuel L. Jackson who put the show on.Humor in this movie is surprisingly balanced extremely well. Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani) is the one who pulls off most of the humor in this.There's a solid amount of emotion in this movie. It doesn't really happen until the third act, and it depends whether or not if it hits you or not. It's not touchy feely but more of a disappointing type of emotion.Overall, The Marvels conveys a solid, fun movie to enjoy. If you enjoyed it as much as me, you may rewatch it in a year or two, but it's not one to keep you on your toes when it gets released on Disney Plus.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Then, somewhere while watching the movie, it becomes, at least to say, a dull experience.So, movies are enjoyable. But, it's a restrictive statement, so, to say.For example, the MCU will not be considered, to come back to life, as a matter of speaking, until the production teams will do something to break this pattern, in creating movies and shows that follow a repetitive model of events, to the denouement of it, all, that is starting to feel like the previous movie.For that, to happen, in my opinion, they need not to align to the rules and/ or general political connundrum, but break the rules and give the spectator, a perspective that is found, out of the box they own.These being said, it's a 6/10, for me - I found, that acting in this movie, was a few steps ahead of my expectations and, all in all, it was enjoyable - with the mentions, above!Summary: The Marvels - where you find a soulmate, there can always be one more!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's unfortunate that this an MCU movie because if you can look under it, The Marvels is a fun and light-hearted popcorn movie that can be watched as a family. At the 1 hour 10 minute mark, be prepared for a hilarious out-of-the-box idea that practically made the movie for me. And if you know nothing about the post-credit scene, you may find it exciting and sets up some big projects in the future. The scenes and exchanges between Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, and Monica Rambeau were the highlight of the film instead of Marvel's usual action climax. Critics may tear this movie apart, but for people who watch just for the entertainment, you may find The Marvels to be worth your time.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The acting, screenplay and even the special effects make this feel more like a Disney+ original than a theatrical release, and it's hard to understand what the point of this film was. Best guess is it's merely a vehicle to link the MCU of old with the new Disney-fied era, which is not a step in the right direction.There's not much more to say about this film.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I didn't want to go to this movie because it didn't interest me much. The first film was bad, Ms Marvel series wasn't good (except maybe the characters, which we also see in this movie) and what they did with Nick Fury in the last couple of years it's disrespectful to the version of Nick that we all grew up with. But because my expectations were near 0, for me this movie was kind of cool. Do not get me wrong, I don't say that it was a good movie, there were a lot of things that could've been better, not to mention that the villain was the most useless and boring character i've ever seen and a plot that doesn't really exist, BUT it was enjoyable (mostly beacuse of Kamala&family, she carried most of the movie + Goose obviously). I can assure you that there were some projects far worse than this (she hulk, quantumania, captain marvel, secret invasion and more).Conclusion: Should you watch this movie? If you watched ms marvel and wandavision and you are a marvel fan you should go for it, but the most important part is to go with 0 expectations.","4 out of 17 found this helpful.

It does try to bring in the three heroes together and try to tie it into the multiverse. With it having Captain Marvel, Ms. Marvel, and Monica's powers entwined, they really had to adjust to each other to save the day. I felt like that did rise the stakes a bit. That's as well an interesting way to get them together. It is a sequel to Captain Marvel, as well a sequel to WandaVision and Ms. Marvel as Monica and Ms. Marvel's stories are continued from there. It is also kinda a sequel to Secret Invasion, though it seems to be the show that might not be needed the most to be seen before this movie. I haven't watched Secret Invasion entirely before I watched this movie and I found I still understood it just fine. On how this movie ended, there should be a continuation to it of some kind, though how it will look like is uncertain as it did poorly in the box office and how it's doing here on IMDb is not too good. Sometimes I feel like stuff happened just for the sake of it. That's what I thought about the Goose storyline. Besides that, I feel like this movie is solid overall and better than what other people say. For me, I'll still watch something even if it has bad reviews, so I can have my own opinion on it. Sometimes what I think is different than what everyone else thinks.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

Which is something I can't say for recent MCU films. Certainly better than Captain Marvel, they are trying to make her more relatable and real, while it does work, it feels a little forced, she's very different to the last Carol we knew.The first act is messy, rushed and catches you up on everything before it, expecting half the audience to not of seen the TV shows. It settle down after and finds its feet, landing some good jokes through natural humour, not forced ones.The third act is good, and they are certainly throwing some future setups in, knowing this might not performed as well as expected, or achieve what they wanted.7/10 not because it's amazing (it's not) but for a sequel, to a reletivily contained film, that isn't trying to be something it's not, it's better than I expected. Think of it in terms of, iron man 2, thor 2, and Antman 2. Trying to build on the last film, some things land, some things don't, but you know I left there with a smile on my face, which I haven't done for MCUs last few films bar one.","5 out of 26 found this helpful.

Intriguingly, the film features a cat in a seemingly pivotal role. This feline character is not merely a background element; it prominently meows throughout, almost as if to constantly remind viewers of its presence - perhaps even enticing them to purchase related merchandise. However, this recurring meowing inadvertently distressed my own cat, leading to a rather frustrating viewing experience for me. Expecting a cinematic escape, I instead found myself managing my pet's anxiety and confusion, caused by the illusion of another cat's presence. Regrettably, I discontinued watching after 20 minutes. I hope that someday, a cat owner within the Marvel Studios team will recognize that such repetitive animal sounds are unnecessary and can be disruptive for household pets. Until then, viewers like myself might face unexpected challenges in enjoying their films.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

It's not really a bad movie, but it does get a little crazy in some situations as Nia DaCosta promised. The action scenes and special effects are always present to offer exciting moments, despite there being some absurd moments. The movie is fun in those aspects, but it still feels like just another superhero movie. Samuel L. Jackson does not disappoint in his role as Nick Fury, although he returns to his role of being just the boss in command who gives the orders and assigns the missions. The three heroines manage to have good chemistry that makes them a good team. Carol Danvers has more personality in this movie, since the first time she appeared in the MCU, she felt somewhat generic. Here she was able to improve with the bonds she forms with her companions, the awareness she gains about her role as Captain Marvel, and the recognition of a mistake she made leading to the events of this film and that Now she must make amends. Kamala Khan is definitely the best of the trio, being very charismatic and cheerful like in Ms. Marvel and it is clear that Iman Vellani proves to be a young actress with a bright future ahead of her. The rest of the characters who could have participated more contribute little and even the villain has an interesting past that could have been explored further. Really, The Marvels is just another Marvel movie that offers a bit of entertainment and does not deserve the rejection it has been receiving even though it is not a masterpiece. It is not even strange that this film is unconvincing for a certain sector and even more so considering that this is the first time that Nia directed a superhero film, which was too big a challenge for someone who is still in his beginnings. In conclusion, The Marvels is just another episode in the world of Marvel like the rest of its installments, but that doesn't mean it's really a bad movie. My final and only valid rating for this film is an 8/10.","18 out of 38 found this helpful.

It was not redeemed by its one brilliant touch, the use of the song ""Memory"" during the main hypercat scenes.I know that superhero stories are nominally science fiction, because they're supposed to portray things that could really happen in the real world, without use of magic or divinity, if we're willing to grant them a couple of wild cards, such as the assumption that we've been able to figure out faster-than-light travel. And I'm OK with a COUPLE. Anything more than that, and we're dealing with fantasy. This one was way too fantastic.

The story is both a follow on from Captain Marvel and Secret Invasion (kinda).Iman Vellani is a joy as Kamala Khan/Ms Marvel, geeking out about being close to her hero, Carol Danvers.

Most of the people involved in this project should NEVER be involved in another film if the world is lucky (I'll check to make sure I don't see another one if they're involved).","12 out of 27 found this helpful.

It feels you must watch these 2 shows to understand the full context of the main plot. Although, the Marvels quickly catches the casual viewer upto speed, of the unfamiliar context on the film the villain is your generic Marvel villain. Nothing more to say than this. It's a fun film with more enjoyment than negative criticism. Ms Marvel is a standout character, Iman Vellani does a superb job. The presence of Ms marvels family in the film makes the film that more fun and relatable. Monica Rambou is an awsome character who I wish received more character development in this film. Captain Marvel stays the same although more likeable in this film. Costume design is great! Director does an excellent job! Writing is simple and straightforward with only few scenes standing out to be significant. Better than I expected, better than the first for sure.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It feels disappointingly lazy due to the gibberish writing and generic plotting, and the character development is weak throughout. Not to mention the fact that the villain is one of the blandest and most uninspired in the MCU. It feels like there are zero stakes to everything that is happening which makes it hard to get drawn into the story. When there are stakes, they come out of nowhere and feel very unearned and artificial.It also suffers from this curse that the MCU now has where everything must be connected in some way. Dragging three characters together, two of whom were introduced properly through TV shows, means that they all suffer from a development perspective. Also, despite watching every single Marvel project, many of them multiple times, I'm starting to get lost as to what is going on in this sprawling universe. If you don't do your homework before coming into one of these films it's easy to disengage slightly.I also think that the action is incredibly bland given the opportunities they had with the powers of the characters. There was so much more potential to be inventive and fun with this side of things but it wasn't capitalised on.Despite all of this, I'm still giving this film 6 stars (although only just). This is because I did enjoy the interactions between the three leads, and the performances are fun from each of them, even if the characters feel underdeveloped. There is also some good comedy throughout, and the pacing is blissfully zippy.","2 out of 14 found this helpful.

The cinematography was uninspired, and the special effects looked outdated.

I always go into a movie hoping for the best especially when it comes to all things superheroes but unfortunately The Marvels is bad movie. Is it the worst MCU entry? I actually don't think it is despite the buzz and lack of interest in this film. Let me explain why.The 3 main leads were actually fun to watch on-screen. I know a lot of people don't like Brie Larson but I think she's a great actress and a good Captain Marvel but the writing and lack of direction fails her yet again. She delivers emotion during times that require it but you don't feel the weight of it due to poor setup and lack of time to develop anything. This is the shortest MCU movie to date the lack of runtime is extremely noticeable.Iman Vellani was a standout as well pouring her love for the character on-screen with an infectiously positive performance. Teyonah Parris was also great as Monica Rambeau once again but like Brie Larson she was given little to do in the movie.There were even a decent amount of well choreographed action sequences but all that does not make up for zero character development, low stakes, directionless plot, terrible villain, bad VFX, cringe side objectives and so much more. I can't go into too much detail without spoiling anything but despite my complaints there is still SOME enjoyment to be had (even if some of it is unintentional laughter from how bad it is at times).","16 out of 39 found this helpful.

I was also a bit lost because haven't seen the Ms. Marvel Disney show.That said, the movie has a couple of memorable scenes (cat lovers will enjoy the movie) and the three leads are great. Plus, it's always fun to see Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury.But the most exciting thing to happen in the movie takes place in the mid-credit scene.

For example, in the Ms. Marvel Disney+ -show, they included a Bollywood-style dance-sequence that - frankly in the context of that series, fit nicely and didn't feel out of place. However, when they've tried including similar one in The Marvels -movie ... it just ... falls flat. It comes out of nowhere, serves no purpose and - just feels weird and forced.Of course, I had the huge misfortune of watching this movie in 3D (I didn't realise that 3D versions of movies are still made) which means that there were constant exaggerated scenes with ""too much"" depth and a ton of CGI to add to that. Watching the movie this way felt nauseating.So as to not only bash the movie, there are a few things I genuinely liked. Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan is possibly the best addition to MCU post-Endgame; her portrayal of the character feels very fresh and natural. It is like she was made for the role. Also, the montage where Carol Danvers, Monica Rambeau and Kamala Khan are learning to use their joint powers together. That part was actually well executed and quite fun to watch. But unfortunately it was only a few minutes out of a very short movie.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

The film tries to capitalize on the success of characters like Carol Danvers, Kamala Khan, and Monica Rambeau, but ends up drowning in a chaotic and incoherent plot.The very premise of the film, with characters swapping places every time they use their powers, seems like it was taken from an episode of a children's TV show. While attempts to explain this strange dynamic through quantum concepts are commendable, the end result is more confusing than engaging.Furthermore, the characterization of the characters seems to have been simplified to the extreme, turning potentially interesting heroes into flat and stereotypical caricatures. Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris, and Iman Vellani do their best with what they have, but they can't work miracles with such a superficial screenplay.Even the action sequences, usually a strong point of Marvel films, fall into the territory of repetition and lack of inventiveness. Battles against the Kree villains seem more like an excuse to showcase special effects than a central element of the plot.In conclusion, ""The Marvels"" is a disappointing film that fails to fully exploit the potential of its characters and premise. With a confusing plot, flat characterization, and uninspired action sequences, this film remains among the less memorable chapters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

This was the first film in the series I actively chose not to go to the cinema and watch, and I'm glad I made that choice. It feels like the writers/director weren't aware they were part of a bigger universe. There's barely any connection to secret invasion, which should have been very closely connected given the subject matter. Ms marvel annoyed me throughout the whole film. The dizzy fangirl theme got boring halfway through the TV show, and carrying it on to the film just added to the annoyance. The effects were good in places, then terrible in others. In my opinion marvel needs to refocus on quality instead of quantity.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

It's high in colors, with an intense energy that doesn't weaken from beginning to end (the last 15-20 minutes focusing more on emotion), and the last few scenes introduce some great stuffs in a very cool way.The power of unity and pure friendship always succeeds !A Marvel movie that has heart, that's for sure.","203 out of 572 found this helpful.

So, naturally, I was really looking forward to the Marvels. Unfortunately it was a major letdown.For starters, this movie was cut to $&*#. Seriously, the editing job on this film was the worst I've ever seen. There are abrupt transitions where you ask yourself 'how did they get there' or 'when did these guys connect' or 'wait, she was just really sad/mad but now everything is fine', including a scene where the main characters face the big bad. It was jarring, and completely inexplicable. You can also tell that a lot of the backstory scenes were cut, because I feel like we were never really shown much about the motivations or history of the generic bad guy. This is the first time I can recall ever noticing the editing being an issue, outside of an indie horror film.Second, the acting was soooooooo wooden. I especially like how Ms. Marvel has been portrayed, but even her scenes fell flat. The characteristic Marvel humor felt out of place, or maybe mis-timed. Honestly it just seemed like everyone was phoning it in.Lastly, I won't spoil the credit's scene, which was cool, but it had the worst CGI that I've come across in an MCU project.Feel free to skip this one.","24 out of 67 found this helpful.

The group has been created for maximum bankability, familiarity and relatability, and to that instrumental end, it delivers exactly what you expect of it and not a single thing, idea or beat more. Its members are nice, even at their most ostensibly fierce, and so unrelievedly bland that it feels like an affront, especially to all the women here doing so much hard work.This is the 33rd movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which continues to expand even as its cultural interest and resonance diminish. ""The Marvels"" will dominate the box office, of course, at least during its opening weekend, just because it will flood theaters. It's pointless complaining, I know (believe me), but it's frustrating what weak tea this movie is because the director, Nia DaCosta (""Little Woods,"" ""Candyman""), has talent, the cast is appealing, and there's a lightly gonzo scene that shows you what the other 100 minutes could have been. It's almost as if the suits at Marvel Studios know it doesn't matter if their movies are any good. Once again, Brie Larson plays Captain Marvel a.k.a. Carol Danvers, a former Air Force pilot who inadvertently picked up her superpowers once upon a time. She kept on flying throughout the decades, though sometimes without a craft, hurtling through space and fighting alongside the Avengers all while maintaining her dewily youthful looks. When she first appears here, she is hanging out with her scene-stealing orange tabby, Goose (played by Tango and Nemo), on her spaceship and doing something important-looking. Soon, with Goose perched on one shoulder - no spacesuits here - this very special cat lady is zipping off to a planet and into another over-plotted, overextended escapade. This time she's joined by two super-empowered beings from the small screen: Kamala Khan a.k.a. Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani), a Captain Marvel superfan from Jersey City (and Disney+); and Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris), an astronaut (introduced as an adult in the series ""WandaVision"") who's part of S. A. B. E. R. In the interest of moving this review along - and because I had no idea what Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) was doing in space with a bunch of uniformed lackeys (other than barking orders with his usual gruffness) - here is how the movie's production notes describe S. A. B. E. R: ""a space station covertly acting as Earth's first point of contact and defense from a rapidly expanding universe."" Written by DaCosta, Megan McDonnell and Elissa Karasik, ""The Marvels"" reunites old friends and foes while introducing new characters and developments, all of which will presumably be folded into future installments, as is the Marvel way. The big fights and minor tension are principally generated by the villainous Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), the ruler (or, in Marvel-speak, Supremor) of the Kree people; she wields a mighty hammer and bears a grudge against Captain Marvel. In one of the larger set pieces, Dar-Benn takes brutal aim against other enemies. As terrified men, women and children flee and buildings fall, the scene briefly summons up visions of our world, which the movie otherwise phenomenally shows the true nature of Marvel. As is always the case with Marvel directors, DaCosta's principal job seems to be to keep the greased gears moving as she folds in innumerable close-ups of happy, sad and mad faces, all of which are meant to remind viewers that their heroes are just like us, only super. To underscore this point, Kamala's fangirl shtick goes on too long; the character is doodling images of her idol when the movie opens and sometime later wears a T-shirt emblazoned with Captain Marvel's image. Once the character calms down, so does Vellani, an appealing performer with comic timing who nicely bounces off both Larson and Parris. They, in turn, have been given an unfortunate surrogate mother-daughter dynamic that is fortunately underdeveloped because all you really want to do is watch Goose, who's indeed golden.","66 out of 173 found this helpful.

The colours and the fight scenes were fantastic. I loved the family involved and I love how we saw a lighter funnier nick fury.

I think Marvel has not taken the time to build strong characters any more, like they did previously over a long, long period of time, like Spider-Man or Iron Man, and they expect us to love characters. We barely know I'm not a hardcore comic fan, so I don't know for sure, but I'm pretty sure they have already used up some of the big characters.The new phase has some good movies, like Love and Thunder, Guardians of the Galaxy, etc., but I just think they are just rushing everything and squeezing every last drop from the almost-gone OG cast.This production feels like it was done in three weeks, but I'm sure it wasn't. The story is just forced down on the poor audience, assuming everyone has watched all the previous releases, so it's enjoyable for them, and they don't walk out of the theater thinking, What the hell did I just watch? I can't convince my mom that Marvel is cool because she just doesn't know who is who or what's what in this particular film, just because she is not a nerd like me, who has watched 30 movies and 6 TV series. Saddly, I still love it, and I love Kamala Harris and Carol Danvers in the MCU, but just because I've watched hours worth of Marvel TV series (Wanda Vision, Secret Invasion, Hawkeye, and Ms. Marvel), I believe Marvel thinks they're more popular than they actually are in pop culture and expects the hardcore MCU fans to fill the movie theaters, which will not happen. Popular Marvel Super Heroes fill movie theaters because we've known them for years, but even we Superhero fans can't buy enough tickets to pay for this movie; they need to be smarter if they want to continue making super hero movies.I didn't really like it as a stand-alone, but since I've watched the series, I found it entertaining. But I know it's a bad movie in pretty much every aspect and could well be a TV episode you can skip. 4/10.","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

Because of how uninterested I was, let alone how Quantumania and Love and Thunder hindered my love for superhero movies, I have become indifferent with the MCU. Fortunately, because of how cool the trailers look and the return of one of my favorite Marvel heroes alongside two other characters I am unfamiliar, I am curious to see how The Marvels would turn out, which is a sequel to Captain Marvel and Ms. Marvel. I would say that, for the most part, it is an enjoyable film but with major creative decisions that did not quite work with me.Starting off with the positives, in my point of view, is Brie Larson's Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel finally having more personality. Unlike the first one where she felt too stoic and showing little to no emotions, here she was able to show off her soft side whenever she is interacting with the other two superheroes and as she tries to become a leader since she hasn't been able to manage a team yet.Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan or Ms. Marvel was an absolute delight to see on the big screen. Even though I am aware that not a lot of people have seen her television show or may not have liked it in general, we cannot deny how much energy she brings whenever she was given the screen time. Even though some of her jokes did not land, you can see how she reacts to serious situations, striving not just to get appreciation from Captain Marvel but becoming a real superhero.As for Monica Rambeau played by Teyonah Parris, there were moments from her that I thought she was cool whenever she was showing off her powers, especially when she is fighting together with Kamala and Danvers. But there are things that I felt were just unresolved or was like an emotional baggage towards Carol that just didn't work for me.The rest of the cast was fine. The Khan family were all adorable and supportive to look at whenever they interact with Kamala, Samuel Jackson as Nick Fury is as good as always but Park Seo-joon felt like he was there but for no reason at all. But of course, like with almost every Marvel movie, the villain always tends to be underutilized. Even though Zawe Ashton did her best in her role as Dar-Benn, I wish she could have been better.Speaking of ""could have been better"", the film's runtime, which is actually the shortest for an MCU film, truly affected the story. There are a lot of sequences that could have been expounded a lot more and the way the movie progressed felt too fast, like it wasn't giving enough time for fans to take in the information and just being spoon-fed a lot by Rambeau. This includes how the superheroes are switching in the first place and how they are able to track down following planets.Not to mention that certain scenes in the second act felt so off and just trying to be funny for the sake of it - which is one of the major reasons why the MCU is already in a decline in terms of quality. I would not give out any spoilers but let me just say that it transitioned to genres that I did not expect and it actually turned me off for a while, just waiting for it to be over and go back to saving the universe again.In conclusion, The Marvels is most likely going to make people even more turned off due to the creative decisions that were made, probably from the studio as shown in several videos on YouTube. But on my end, just ignoring how the franchise is being ridiculed as of this moment, I would say that the cast saved most parts of the film and in a way, was better than Captain Marvel and not as bad as people might expect - but could have been so much more.","61 out of 205 found this helpful.

Bunch of kids in costume running around, no big action scenes, just small frames and a lot of pointless talking.

Let's hope all these rumors about them resetting some things about how they produce content are true.A few more minutes developing each of the main characters would have made a world of difference, but instead they used that time for cat jokes and a musical number.

"2","/10","A Missed Catch in the Marvel Cinematic Universe!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9459665/?ref_=tt_urv","Godfather0219","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26717320/?ref_=tt_urv","27 November 2023","To me, ""The Marvels"" (Captain Marvel 2) can be considered the worst performance by Marvel in terms of basic skills to date. Whether it's the script, action sequences, or the pacing of comedy elements, all have glaring issues, especially in editing, which is simply astounding. The arrangement of some scene transitions is almost as problematic as in ""Scarjo"", which is truly shocking.What's subtle is that there are many places in this film that could have been developed, and the director also understands this, so those parts are highlighted. For example, the relationship between Captain Marvel and Monica, or the plot where Ms. Marvel should have been disappointed in Captain Marvel, which would have allowed her to grow further in her understanding of heroes, are all obvious areas for development.However, after these parts are pointed out, they are casually passed over with ""Pitch Perfect""-style sisterly bonding, ultimately making the whole of ""The Marvels"" like a game of catch. The ball is potential; you can always clearly see the ball, but both sides keep dropping it, with only a few successful catches. In the end, because the ball is too conspicuous, it actually highlights the chaos of the whole game.Furthermore, the acting in ""The Marvels"" is a bit confusing. Among the main characters of the film, almost only Iman Vellani, who played Ms. Marvel, turned in a sufficiently complete and consistent performance. As for Brie Larson, who played Captain Marvel, and Teyonah Parris, who played Monica, both give a sense of being at a loss, appearing indecisive between seriousness and comedy.As for the main villain played by Zawe Ashton, she was originally a boring character with no play, so it's natural that she didn't perform much. Conversely, Samuel Jackson's Nick Fury, just after the events of the series ""Secret Invasion"", suddenly became the kind of character who keeps making jokes and sarcastic remarks, making people feel that this is not the same character at all. So like Captain Marvel and Monica, it has less to do with their acting skills and more to do with the script of this entire movie, which is overly fragmented in style.Interestingly, although the problems are so obvious, the overall level of ""The Marvels"" is probably about the same as ""Thor: The Dark World"", and there is still some entertainment value. At least for me, it's easier to bear than recent films like ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"", ""Thor: Love and Thunder"", ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"", and ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"", and it's more entertaining.In summary, looking at the hidden segments, ""The Marvels"" indeed holds an important position in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's just a pity that those basic skills, especially in terms of editing, are handled too poorly. At least from my personal estimation, next year's Golden Raspberry Awards will likely not miss this film...PS: By the way, I think that Park Seo-joon's planet can be considered the biggest highlight of the whole film. But because of this, the complete lack of explanation about the fate of that planet in the later plot is also a surprisingly casual arrangement that can even affect the depiction of the main characters.

Also, since Kamala Kahn is practically the only character with charisma, the movie relies on her a little too much.

My theater membership allows me to see one free movie per month, and for November this was the movie. I saw the mediocre reviews and thought that there were probably worse ways to kill two hours. I suppose I was right, but this has to go pretty low on that list. I don't know how this got released in the state it did. The last marvel movie I watched was Thor 4 and that was also an incompetent mess, although The Marvels wasn't as bad. I genuinely can't think of any positives for this movie. The only reason I gave it a 2/10 is because I don't think it ever becomes comically awful aside from one scene. The two most widely praised elements of the movie were the action and the actress who played Ms Marvel. The action was your standard CGI marvel goyslop, and Ms Marvel was very annoying. I guess she was fine compared to how flat the other two leads were but not by much. Don't go see this movie. It is a good thing that this movie is bombing as hard as it is. Maybe marvel will learn some kind of lesson from this, but it's more likely that they'll just keep paying to bring back legacy characters.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

Most of why it's less boring is cause it's really really stupid. It also makes Captain Marvel not as much of a unlikable character and tries to make her not a completely awful person to root forThe problem starts with this actually, like Carol Danvers in all other instances of this character is a totally rude and awful. Even in this movie, it acknowledges this character being like literally a monster. It just takes a completely different personality of a character and puts it on captain Marvel. It just pretends like she somehow developed a conscience/empathy and disregards her being a Dookie butt. Whatever who needs consistencySpeaking of consistency this movie couldn't even be consistent with its own tones? It's trying to be serious, it's trying to be funny, and it tries to make you think what youre watching is super awesome. It fails at all of those things intentionally every single time. Every instance of humor was either extremely cringe or very dumb low hanging fruit. The movie will attempt to make jokes during the very serious scenes which are never funny and are often entirely clashing with how we're supposed to be feeling. One time it even did this thing where it went into an animation that was kinda neat but it literally never did it ever again. Just a lot of questionable tones and stylistic choices that clash constantly.Sidenote, the acting sucked across the board. Brie Larson kept doing this thing where her eyes were just BULGING 👁 💋 👁 out of her head and she was just super surprised by everything. It actually ended up being very wooden. The other two ""main"" characters were also bad but I thought the character who played the niece was particularly awful. Not a single word the entire movie felt natural and she was probably my least favorite person to watch.The main villain was hilarious. Her costume(and personality) makes her look like daenyrs targaren season 8 style and she is just so over the top the entire movie. She reminds me of Eddie redmayne from Jupiter ascending or maybe even Troll 2 witch. It's hilarious to watch her lick her lips and give goofy expressions when looking at her weapons after they get powered up.I haven't even gone into the story yet man ugh. It's so bad man. Basically it just doddles around till the main villain is introduced. Characters hop around everywhere and it takes them FOREVER to figure literally anything out even though it's insanely obvious what's happening. They just keep having eureka moments like 20 minutes after the audience figures out what's happening. Then often they disregard what they've learned and conveniently things just start working differently from how they were explained in the movie just for conflict. Also Captain Marvel is insanely overpowered and she just keeps being stupid to make things harder. She's just broken OP man...There was a main conflict in the movie that was just a complete red harring(again which is obvious) but it actually just has nothing to do with the movie. Seriously there is a whole massive ps3 graphics scene that just could be taken out of the movie and it wouldn't have changed anything.Cgi throughout the movie looked really bad but those CGI cats were really some ps3 graphics man. The sets often looked fake as heck and looked like plastic or very heavily cgi gummy plastic garbage.The music was not very notable but I liked the choice to use that skillex song. I don't really remember anything musical besides that song being used, even in the scene was often filmed so horribly that I couldn't tell what was happening.And yeah lastly the cinematography was kinda awful. It was shaky and looked extremely unprofessional for a Marvel movie. It was often incoherent during action scenes and was edited together poorly.Overall this movie sucked. It was often enough so bad it's funny. This makes it at least a little more entertaining than the extremely unlikable boring snoozefest that is captain marvel. I think technically speaking, that movie is better... with this movies incompetence, I'm at least not entirely bored. Incomprehensible, badly acted, poorly shot, poorly plotted, boring music, terrible stupid movie hahaHigh 2/10.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

The film tries to cram in three different superheroes: Carol Danvers (Brie Larson), Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris), and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), but fails to give any of them enough development or personality. The plot is a convoluted mess that involves a Kree villain, a mysterious wormhole, and a magic bangle that somehow links the powers of the three heroes. The film also suffers from tonal inconsistency, shifting from comedy to drama to action without any coherence or logic. The humor is forced and unfunny, the drama is melodramatic and clichéd, and the action is bland and confusing. The visual effects are also terrible, looking cheap and fake throughout the film. The Marvels (2023) is a waste of time and talent, and a clear sign that the Marvel Cinematic Universe is running out of steam and ideas. MCU needs better writers and producers to get back on course, or they will continue to lose money big time.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

This constant 'humour' removes the audience from the plot or action, as all gravity of situation is lost and relatability non-existent.Seriousness is taken from Larson, subjecting her to a quirky female lead, ill-fitting to the power of the character. Vellani's uniqueness is lost, transitioning into a Peter Parker-type with added squeals rather than remaining the great character of Kamala Khan introduced in her series. Parris' Rambeu, unfortunately, makes very little impact. Painfully, Jackson's Nick Fury becomes a lesser character with each appearance in the MCU as he is continually pulled into the weakest releases. At least Shroff is greatly refreshing again.Villains, particularly Ashton's lead of Dar-Benn, are uninspired and the Kree as a collective are wasted, at least matching what was done with the Kree in Secret Invasion. Everything off-world is losing it's impact, and whilst there is a clear positioning in the timeline, the films placement within the wider universe is tough to establish as nothing is memorable.Visually, it's a little disappointing with special effects looking far from sharp, a criticism increasingly being aimed at Disney.The Marvels is meant to be fun, as evident by the musical planet, which will be insufferable to most, surely, but I'm not sure who this film is pitched at. Its not funny enough (or at all) to be a comedy, yet has enough 'humour' to distract from the action, and is packed with sci-fi logic which isn't particularly engaging. Through no fault of the three leads, who just work with the context they are put in, this is a bad film.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

But this is great! If anything it could have leaned into the more fun elements harder. The three stars are three excellent actors getting to enjoy their characters. The main weakness is Zawe Ashton feels like she's acting in a different film to everyone else.It's not done the box office business which is weird and such a shame. I won't watch any of those other recent Marvel efforts again (why would anyone do that to themselves?!?) but I can't wait to see The Marvels again. That the multiverse came so soon to the MCU was always a very desperate sign. This shows there is a way of simply ignoring all that self-indulgence, embracing the fun and telling a story.","10 out of 20 found this helpful.

The storyline was unimaginative, dull, and outright stupid.The standout in the movie was Iman Vellani; she infused the film with a sense of fun and provided some level of entertainment.As for Teyonah Parris, her character abruptly entered the story out of nowhere, gaining superpowers without any meaningful explanation or training. The introduction of her character seemed utterly pointless.Throughout the movie, Brie Larson appeared visibly uncomfortable with her surroundings and the overall situation.To cut to the chase, the story was lacking, with a few enjoyable moments. However, it ultimately presented a weak representation of the Marvel universe.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

One of them is of course an annoying child sidekick upgraded to a main character, and you'll be confused at times if you haven't seen every other Marvel movie (and tv show so far).But its not a total disaster. There is some decent action and the characters switching their powers around at least adds a little something different. Even if there are a couple even more out there ideas in the movie that force it more and more down to a below average score.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

From the mind-numbingly predictable plot to the cringe-worthy dialogue, this film is a masterclass in how not to make a superhero epic.The characters, who are supposed to be larger-than-life superheroes, come across as cardboard cutouts reciting lines from a poorly written high school play. The lackluster performances from the cast only serve to underscore the shallowness of the script. It's as if the actors themselves couldn't muster any genuine interest in the drivel they were being forced to deliver.The special effects, which should be the saving grace of any superhero flick, are astonishingly subpar. The CGI looks like it was pulled from the archives of a forgotten '90s video game, leaving audiences more likely to cringe than gasp in awe. The action sequences are so poorly choreographed that they resemble a chaotic mess of pixels rather than the epic battles promised in the trailers.The film's attempts at humor fall painfully flat, with jokes that seem to have been recycled from a worn-out joke book. The audience, instead of laughing, was left in an awkward silence that spoke volumes about the movie's failure to connect on any emotional level.The Marvels shamelessly borrows elements from successful superhero franchises without adding anything innovative or compelling of its own. It's a shameless cash grab that preys on the popularity of the genre without bringing anything new to the table. In the end, this film is a forgettable, 1h45m slog that leaves you questioning why you ever thought watching superheroes on the big screen could be an enjoyable experience. Save your money and avoid this cinematic disaster at all costs.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

I thought I was watching an episode of lost because I was completely lost in this disorganized hot mess of a movie. I've been through what, over 20 movies faithfully since the beginning, and this is how I'm rewarded? I will never see another Captain Marvel, I'm sorry the character is flat, emotionless, and I just can't relate. I mean Wonder Woman got it right.....reboot this character or phase it out she serves no purpose.Now this could have been a great movie with the current cast; but someone decided not to develop the characters and I'm sorry I'm not going to watch a TV show to learn about characters in a movie, not gonna happen. So you come in expecting to just know who some of these people are? Confusing as heck, who green lite the crossover from TV and theater platforms?Lastly, let's take the most complex story line for an up and coming ensemble of unknown C list heros and hope they have the talent and backing of the writers and director to pull it off.......

Whilst saving the day her powers are entangled with two other superheroes causing them team up as The Marvels.The problem is straight out the script. For a sequel, there is really no character development and the story itself is rather thin, to the point where you sit wondering where the whole MCU is heading.

The movie starts out with some action and a foreshadowing statement by Nick Fury ""I jsut need you for one more mission"" to Capt Marvel. Does that mean the end of Brie in this role? We can only hope. There is a black superhero that we met in ""Wanda Vision"" but have no idea what her powers are yet. There is a little girl who just got her powers but fills the ""asian"" block and she is a teenager so there is that cute ""first kiss is awesome"" crowd. They bring in a Korean prince for no reason at all. The second act drags and the final act is a let down. But the hidden scene will be the reason most come to see the movie. It does not disappoint.

Very few movies get 5 or below from me and this is one of them. Normally a film gets 7 if i consider it ok, 8 if I'd watch it again and 6 if I think it sub-par. Very few get anything but 6,7 or 8. This year Police State, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour and Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One got a 9 and The Great Escaper got 10. The last time anything got a 5 was Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, 2022.What can I say about this movie? First of all a rather unconvincing villain with a plan that unfolds in a rather undramatic way. Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel teams up with Carol's estranged niece Captain Rambeau and super-fan Kamala Khan, aka Ms. Marvel. Ms Marvel has newly acquired powers. They get proficient as a team surprisingly fast. There's plenty of fights and space vistas. Who's doing what is not always obvious. The only amusing bit was with the kitties. You'll see. I can't see repairing a rift in space and time like it's crocheted together as really convincing. So it's quite a spectacle but with a rather weak plot.","16 out of 53 found this helpful.

I know there are plenty of people complaining about this movie (there always seem to be more complaints about action movies with women in the leading roles...funny how that works), but if you like these characters (like Goose), you should enjoy this movie! If you haven't seen other Marvel movies, I might suggest watching Captain Marvel first, and the Ms. Marvel TV show, to get to know the characters, but you don't need to watch any other Marvel movies/shows to be able to follow it.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Sure, the Marvel movies makes for fair enough entertainment, given their effects and such, but there are just too many of them, and they sort of seem like a dime a dozen.The storyline in ""The Marvels"" was a bit cluttered and somewhat of a struggle to really grasp and understand what writers Nia DaCosta, Megan McDonnell and Elissa Karasik really were trying to convey here with the script and storyline. Sure, it was watchable, but it was mostly because of the constant non-stop action and the special effects. And there was a bit too much comedy throughout the course of the movie, which made the movie feel unnecessary goofy.The villain in the movie, Dar-Benn (played by Zawe Ashton), felt like a rather irrelevant and pointless antagonist, as she seemed to have very little motivation or cause for her villainous acts. Was there something to her storyline prior to what transpired in ""The Marvels"" that would have done the character more justice?The acting performances in ""The Marvels"" was good, and leading actresses Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris and Iman Vellani certainly carried the movie quite nicely.I have to mention the song and dance scene in ""The Marvels"", because it was especially rough and horrible to sit through. It felt so out of place and out of tune with the entire overall feel of the movie. It is so cringeworthy that it has to be seen in order to be believed how toe-curling bad it was.There was a lot of action in ""The Marvels"", and I mean a lot! It was almost a non-stop action fest from start to end, and while it definitely was an upscaled speed that the movie went forward in, it was somewhat on the cost of a profound and compelling storyline. The action were overshadowing the narrative in the movie, truth be told.Visually then ""The Marvels"" is good. Of course it is, as it is a Marvel Studios movie. And that is something that holds true for all of the Marvel movies, the CGI effects are quite amazing. And let's just be honest, it is the effects that serve as the deal-sweetener when you sit down to watch these copy/paste movies.My rating of ""The Marvels"", from director Nia DaCosta, lands on a five out of ten stars.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I had mixed feelings about Captain Marvel but this movie was completely silly. Disney seems to be mixing up it's children's programming with it's Marvel universe which is not good. The actors are not convincing. Brie is attractive but Carol Danvers isn't an endearing character. I didn't connect with any character in the movie. A couple of scenes were obviously supposed to be funny but this is a Marvel movie, not Mel Brooks. It didn't feel that way the whole time but the song and dance scene and the cat scene remove you from any seriousness the film may have had. It felt like a film written for twelves year olds by twelves year olds. In my opinion the acting was bad. Even Fury seemed little forced or rushed or off, something just was a miss. The story was probably better than Captain Marvel but everything else made it a worse movie. I know you can't replace Brie at this point but surely for 300 million you can find better people to surround her.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

It has great characters such as Monica Rambeau, Ms Marvel, and Fury returning, but it just seems to go through the typical Marvel motions with literally nothing surprising or compelling about it.I couldn't even finish it.

There are characters that they could have included that they did not. Some of the characters were very weak, especially the woman that plays the ""bad guy"". Some of the costumes and make up are actually poorly done, especially the Kree characters. There are some parts of the character development that are very weak as well.

The writing is just really bad. I suspect too many writers were involved, with too many corporate demands on them to meet various aims, so that the result is that no character has any real moment where you care about them, because they don't show any depth or consistency in who they are. They are just a series of ill-timed jokes and tedious comments, interspersed by not great special effects of people punching each other. I think the worst is that there are no stakes. No one seems to really care about anything. Therefore as the audience you don't care either. I have no idea what the point was.

What I would say is this movie was scripted and directed more properly for ""direct to DVD"" instead of theatre.I promise that I will not provide any spoilers, because you know what? I didn't really get the whole story. The three main characters were a complete mess. Nothing really meshed with them together.Now, there were some funny parts. Kamala Khan's parents provided some comedy relief, but not for every scene they were in. Some of their lines were just overblown and eye rolling. Brie Larson had some funny lines too.This movie kind of reminded me of Deadpool, except Deadpool was outrageously ridiculous in the fighting, so you just are there to watch without thinking. The problem with THIS movie is that I tried not to think about this movie and I was completely confused. The fighting action, the lines that Ms Marvel spewed out without context, the actions... again... nothing made a bunch of sense to me.I am surprised that some people at the theatre laughed pretty hard at many of the scenes. To each their own I guess.This is where I will say that this movie was not a complete waste of time. I think it had potential, but it lacked a lot of substance. Lot of girl power, but probably waaaaay too much as I got lost in some of the power management scenes. You could argue that this is a movie might have been better watched muted. I'm just exaggerating, but the story was really terrible. It's as if the writers just threw ""whaterver"" together and said, ""Ok, let's go with that because I have to get home for dinner"".I really disliked the story for Kamala Khan, she made no sense and confused me from the beginning of the movie. I had a feeling this movie was going to be bad, but glad it was a discounted ticket price and we like Marvel movies.Oh, just one post-credit scene too. Lame.","8 out of 24 found this helpful.

The first half hour was full of action but without really explaining where the story was going.

It dumbed down the movie and it felt more like a super hero chick flick. And the cats. And the singing. It was just a step too far. It felt like a sequel that had to be made to keep the characters ticking over and relevant (and employed) but I wouldn't even bother watching it again when it comes on Disney+","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

But by the time the protagonists got together I learned to enjoy surfing the chaos. Adding a half hour of exposition would just slow down the story, and more importantly, not project the confusion of the characters with a rapid unfolding of complex events. Vital points of backstory are provided as needed by the characters. It's important to the story that Captain Marvel did NOT see the MS. MARVEL and WANDAVISION series. Events DEPEND on a lack of understanding and learning to trust. THE MARVELS is all about learning to trust in a harsh and insane world, and that's the perfect view for these times.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

She's mega powerful with no real growth. There's no vulnerability and she's just not fun. That said, I thought the original movie ""Captain Marvel"" had a few good moments and I enjoyed it OK. Here's the big but, I really didn't enjoy ""The Marvels"" and didn't feel it was a movie that needed to be made. In general, I feel the Marvel movies have been coasting on past greatness for a while. Thor Love and Thunder was horrible and left me hoping they never make another Thor movie. It's sad to see beloved marvel characters reduced to sad unwatchable versions of their former selves. Even in the case of Captain Marvel, she was reduced to comic relief a good part of the time and I don't think Brie Larson has that comic ability to make it enjoyable. Don't get me wrong, I think Brie Larson is stunning and is a good actor; I just don't see a superhero movie as her platform for success.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Movie Review -The Marvels Review: Nia DaCosta brings the first ever female superheroes assembled version with The Marvels, featuring three MCU superheroes. Brie Larson as Carol Danvers, Teyonah Parris as Monica Rambeau, and Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan join forces against Dar-benn, played by Zawe Ashton. This is the first time that we have three leading ladies and a female antagonist together in a Marvel Studios' film. That adds one more reason why this film should attract more females to cinemas. However, I, as a male viewer, didn't have any issues watching and enjoying it. The Marvels has to be one of the most comically funny superhero movies in recent times. GOTG 3 and Thor's cosmic adventure did attempt that organic comedy but couldn't bring it out the way they wanted. Here, The Marvels does it. And it's so visually attractive. Some films look grand on IMAX and are made for such experiences. The Marvels is certainly that one. What this film lacks is emotional entanglement and USP factors that define the overall motive. If you aren't looking for that, then be assured, you'll have a blast watching The Marvels this Diwali.Carol, aka Captain Marvel (Brie Larson), has destroyed Supreme Intelligence at Kree Land, which makes things worse for the locals. Amongst them is Dar-benn (Zawe Ashton), and she is off to settle the score with Carol, aka The Annihilator (a pet name they gave to Captain America). She harnesses the power of the Band (a similar bangle Kamala Khan has) and pairs it with her staff, named the Universal Weapon, to tear apart a jump point in space. More jump points mean more problems in the timeline and more destruction. The trio of The Marvels-Captain Marvel, Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Paris), and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani)-must assemble to stop Dar-benn from destroying earth and other planets, but there is a problem. All three female superheroes possess similar powers that are connected to the power/light and the jump point has made their powers entangled. Whenever they use power, they switch places, as in, they transport through time spaces. Will the trio overcome the problem and find a way to stop Dar-benn?It's no secret that The Marvels is the MCU's shortest movie ever, and let's hail the screenplay writer, editor, and director for that. 105 minutes is the full runtime, and you have 10 minutes of ending credits in that, so the ride is actually only about 95 minutes long. You find your seat, finish your popcorn, and half the film is over. You then put your hands on cold drinks and Samosas, and the film is over. Hell yes, it's that super-fast! MCU needed a break from some of those boring flicks that always felt 15-20 extra long, and here The Marvels did it. They were reading a lot of reviews, I guess. Even Nia was of the same opinion. When it starts, when you are in midway, and when it ends, you don't even get time to calculate that. It's FUN at all-time high for the MCU, but the only problem is that it's TOO predictable.Kamala has a bangle, so that makes her equally powerful as Dar-benn, and eventually, they win. It's too mainstream, man. Kamala's fangirling looks cute in the beginning, and since she is a teenager, it all looks so humorous. But after a while, the same fangirl moments start getting on your nerves, and you feel like, ""Is Captain Marvel a god?""We didn't know it"". The musical parts are hilarious. You don't get a moment to analyse what just happened and why you laughed. But a moment later, it all feels soapy. Are we into an opera show? I asked my friend on the right seat, and he was already scratching his head. Kamala can't use her powers to clear the mess at home. Why? Carol can't tell about her story from Aldana, but she can take Kamala and Monica there. What's the logic? Dar-benn's end and Monica's sacrifice are so overly dramatic, as if we didn't know about the end credit scene. Oh wait, there is a HUGE surprise in the end credit scene, and I should advise you not to leave your seats before that.Brie Larson's performance as Captain Marvel is maybe a typecast, but that's the best thing about her. CM has to be how fans imagine her, and she has that certain appeal beyond her glamour. Iman Vellani is set to win the hearts of all teenagers who watch the movie. Her accent and innocence just can't be hated or disliked. She is the fan girl you want to be; she's lost in a fantasy, but that's okay for that age. When she was dancing at Aladna, the entire theatre was hooting. It wasn't that high of a moment, but you know, sometimes your character and your portrayal make it bigger. Teyonah Parris, as Captain Rambeau, has done well in that emotional scene, while the rest of the time she was just passing the time with a decent act. Zawe Ashton has been impressive, be it in terms of looks or that ferocious attitude despite such a glamorous face. Zenobia Shroff's possessive mother and Mohan Kapur's Urdu dialogues are going to impress Indians, while Samuel L. Jackson's Fury remains unshakeable. Saagar Shaikh, Gary Lewis, Park Seo-joon, and other supporting cast members are okay.Talking about visuals, The Marvels is a cinematic treat. I have been lucky to get a chance to see it at IMAX, and that has certainly escalated my viewing experiences. The visual effects are simply beautiful. The fight sequences are breathtaking and so well choreographed. The first action sequence when the leading ladies keep switching places, and then in the ending when they again switch places under some boundary against the antagonist, are enough to recommend this film for big-screen viewing. I also love the sound effects of IMAX. When your seats vibrate during noisy scenes, you feel like living the moment in real life, and The Marvels has some scenes of that standard. Nia DaCosta has made a super entertaining film, no doubt. It's just cliched, that's all. From the basic surroundings to every major conflict, everything is predictable. That's the biggest issue with The Marvels. Some scenes go overboard while trying to make a funny impression, but they work against the film, especially that mediocre climax. So much hype around the band and Dan-berr and you don't even give it a proper, large-scale conclusion? The Marvels lacks a few textbook things like this, while the rest of the film is super entertaining and full of joy. Take your families and enjoy the female superheroes' assembled version from Marvel Studios this Diwali. Don't worry, the cat won't eat you.RATING - 5/10*","18 out of 71 found this helpful.

This could be due to underdeveloped plot points, rushed pacing, or unclear character motivations.Poor Writing and Storytelling: Weak dialogue, plot holes, and a lack of emotional depth can make a superhero movie feel hollow. The focus might have been on spectacle over character development and a cohesive story.Singing? Seriously?: Humor can be subjective, but some jokes in The Marvels might have landed flat or felt out of place.Here's how these issues could have been fixed:Tighter Script: A more focused script with a clear direction and well-defined character arcs could have elevated the movie.Character-Driven Plot: Instead of relying solely on action sequences, the story could have prioritized the characters' emotional journeys and their relationships with each other.Humor that Fits: Leaning into the strengths of the cast and the film's tone could have resulted in more organic and enjoyable humor.Despite the criticism, some viewers enjoyed the team-up dynamic and the potential of the new heroes like Ms. Marvel. Here are some things the movie did well:Introducing New Heroes: Showcasing Kamala Khan and her powers alongside established characters like Captain Marvel could be a highlight for fans.Cosmic Spectacle: The movie might have delivered visually stunning space battles and interdimensional travel sequences.Overall, The Marvels seems to be a case of missed potential. With a stronger script and focus, it could have been a more satisfying entry in the MCU.Worst movie of marvel, period.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The story is weak and predictable, the effects are mediocre and the acting is decent at best. The actors seem to do their best with what they are given, but they are hampered by the poor direction and vision of the filmmakers. The movie does not have a clear identity or purpose, and it feels like a mishmash of different genres and tones. The movie does not explore the potential of its characters or their relationships, and it wastes the opportunity to create a meaningful and engaging story. The movie is not a disaster, but it is not a marvel either. It is a bland and forgettable film that does not live up to the expectations of the fans or the critics.

They know us hardened fans are done and whatever they make can't save us from hating on it all so I feel that this latest movie was a clear signal that the baton has been passed to the younger generation and that they are beginning to build from the beginning again with younger actors and younger themes to accommodate and prepare the next young generation to be fully hooked in for the next ten-fifteen year ride. And you know what? I personally think that's ok - and when you watch this new movie with this in mind it is quite easy to enjoy it and have fun. I hope they manage to build a universe of characters up that my kids enjoy honestly because we were the lucky ones, we lived when Stan lived and enjoyed the source material and the real comics and (some of) the mcu before it changed. I'm interested to see what they do next but now I'm watching these movies with my kids because I used to love marvel and I hope they can enjoy the stories as much as I did.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

My husband wanted to watch it otherwise I would've turned it off shortly after starting. I had to put ear plugs in and just close my eyes it was so utterly annoying. I ended up falling asleep while he finished it. He was interested since he's read the comic books, but to me, it was just irritating. Thank God we didn't have to pay to see it.

I didn't love the first movie Captain Marvel and this one just left a haze in my brain. While I enjoyed the Ms. Marvel TV series, this movie just left me flat. Dull and slow, with far too many silly scenes-what the hell is a Flerkin? And having them invade to a song from cats? Is that the screenplay writers idea of humor? In WW2, when the Japanese swept through the pacific, they suffered from something later called 'Victory Disease'. Marvel, under Disney is suffering the same thing. Where they once made entertaining films, now they push out drek like this and wonder why these movies bomb? Go back and examine phase 1 and 2. Want to see good movies? These are.

It never felt too much or over the top.Iman Vellani that plays Kamala Khan is a great actress! She really was born to play this part! Great casting!And why all the hate on Brie Larson? She is amazing in the Marvel movies. And The Marvels was no different. She did an amazing job. You can see that she takes the role seriously and plays it from the heart!Teyonah Parris that plays Monica Rambeau also did a fantastic job with her part.All the ladies did very well!And we don't even have to mention Mr Samuel L.

Maybe they even did it on purpose so at least some audience were able to realize that this was not the story they were initially payed to tell. That would explain the constant impression of an unfinished draft. Who knows. Also, it requires from you to have seen the related series previously in order to not be utterly lost in the many characters stories.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie feels flat and unexiting some music cues just didn't fit.I just couldn't see the synargy between the main character there was no chemistry like with the avengers or Guardians, Brie as always does a gr8 job but feels as if her character and presence was diluted to share the spotlight.It seems the director tried to make it funny but missed the mark, they should perhaps take a page from James gunn's Guardian recipy.I was really disappointed and won't add this movie to my MCU Blu-ray collection.The movie feels lacking and more cg was added to fill the voids, sory but this movie really felt more like a fan based non cannon production than something that you would expect from marvel studious, a crossroads Easter egg advert than something MCU cannon.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

In any case, I went into the film with no expectations. Even though there are bad movies and TV series, I like Marvel's works, and I want to watch them even if I don't like them. Captain Marvel is not as bad as it has been portrayed; it is simply poorly written. It was not what I expected from this movie. I had a feeling I was going to watch a bad film. The plot of the film is simple and could have been told as a series; for example, Ms. Marvel's season 2. It could be described as the second season of Marvel. The acting wasn't very good. Ms. Marvel character seems likable to most people, but although I sometimes find it likable, sometimes I don't find it likable, and I see it as a contrived character trying to be sympathetic. Overall, I had fun with the movie, but it was a bad movie and didn't add anything new to the MCU. I liked both scenes after the movie; of course, the second and last scenes were very important for the future of the MCU and were expected. Anyway, the movie is bad. By the way, one of the best scenes in the movie was the one with cats.","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

The protagonists' arcs feel rushed and superficial, leaving viewers disconnected from their struggles and triumphs. Character development takes a backseat, resulting in a lack of emotional investment in their fates.The film's villain is a glaring weak point, characterized by a generic and uninspired design. The lack of a compelling antagonist diminishes the stakes, as the conflict lacks the intensity needed to engage the audience. The narrative falters further due to an overreliance on tired tropes, making the antagonist's motives and actions predictable and uninspiring.The storytelling itself is a chaotic mess, with disjointed plotlines that struggle to coalesce into a cohesive whole. Subplots are introduced haphazardly, creating a jumbled narrative that feels more like a checklist of superhero clichés than a thoughtfully crafted story. Pacing issues exacerbate these problems, leaving viewers bewildered by the abrupt shifts in tone and pacing.Despite the film's potential to explore complex themes, it opts for superficial storytelling that fails to resonate on a deeper level. The lack of nuance in character interactions and the oversimplification of moral dilemmas result in a narrative that feels juvenile and lacking in substance.In conclusion, The Marvels falls short of expectations, plagued by poorly written characters, an uninspiring villain, and a narrative that struggles to find coherence. It's a disheartening installment that fails to capture the essence of what makes superhero stories compelling and memorable.","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

I think the other actors believe they are making a decent movie so I pity them when they watched the final cut. I imagine they were working out how to distance themselves as quickly as possible.The plot is a shambolic mess and is no clearer on a second watching although, to be fair, I failed to finish the second viewing as I just couldn't stomach it.The action is purely special affects and there is nothing special about them.Overall I am disappointed for Brie as I thought she maybe could turn the Captain Marvel character into a watchable series but this movie pretty much ends that.I assume the director will get a lot of the blame for the end result but maybe the blame needs to spread further as this continues the trend of destroying the Marvel franchise.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

Is it on a par with Endgame, far from it.Is it is bad as Thor love and thunder, well hell no it's not.I think it could have done being another 20 minutes longer, which could have been used to flesh out some of the characters, the main villain in the movie could have benefitted from that, you are sort of just expected to dislike her from the get go, but no explanation why you are supposed to dislike her. This did come later in the movie, but it sort of give her some form of justication for being a bit of a git.It was a good, funny movie probably on par with the first AntMan or Doctor Strange, in case anyone was wondering, I have added an extra point for the post credit scene, the only thing I will say about it is that it's not to be missed and will possibly and hopefully change the MCU forever.It's the thing marvel fans have been waiting for since the Fox purchase, if you know then you know, and if you don't know then strap yourself in for the ride, it's going to be a good one.","27 out of 76 found this helpful.

The only comic book movie worse was Harley Quinn. What do The Marvels and Harley Quinn have in common? They are made for tween girls not for adults ( especially not for adult males). What did I like? Kamala. She was a fun character, but that is about it. The worst? Those loud explosions and flashing lights. I have never seen a movie that showed as many lights as this one did. I also could not stand Monica who brought nothing to the table ( especially her ""Easter Egg""). It was nothing but a promo for the next film she is in ( something to avoid like the plague). Then there is Carol ( Brie Larson). There is nothing original about her. She is a rip off of Superman, she even has his look when she flies. I would like to be generous and give The Marvels one star because of Kamala , but because there is too much bad stuff ( including that cat), I cannot. It deserves NO stars ( although I have to list it as one star according to IMDB rules). Simply put the worst Marvel movie. ZERO stars from me.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

In my opinion, it's the worst one they've ever made. It may sound harsh, especially to die-hard Marvel fans, but hear me out. I have been a fan of Marvel movies for a long time and have watched every movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) multiple times. However, the latest movie left me disappointed and unsatisfied.One of the significant issues with the movie is its pacing. The movie is slow and dull, with little action or excitement to keep the audience engaged. The movie spends too much time setting up the backstory of the characters, which results in a lack of character development. The audience is expected to care about the characters without getting to know them properly, which makes it hard to connect with them.Another issue with the movie is its plot. The plot is convoluted and confusing, with too many subplots and unnecessary twists and turns. The movie tries to tackle too many themes, including love, sacrifice, and redemption, but fails to do justice to them. The story is predictable, and the climax feels rushed and unsatisfying.The movie's villains are also weak and forgettable. The movie introduces a new villain but fails to establish him as a credible threat. The villain's motivations are unclear, making his actions arbitrary and unnecessary. The movie also fails to give the heroes a worthy opponent to fight, which undermines the entire premise of the movie.The movie's visual effects and cinematography are impressive, but they are not enough to save the movie. The movie relies too heavily on its visuals to distract the audience from its flaws. The movie's action sequences are few and far between, and when they happen, they feel underwhelming and lackluster.Overall, 'The Marvels' is a disappointing addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie fails to live up to the high standards set by its predecessors. The movie's pacing, plot, and villains are all weak, which makes it hard to connect with the characters or care about their struggles. The movie's visuals are impressive, but they are not enough to save the movie from its flaws. For casual viewers, it's not worth the time or money.","5 out of 18 found this helpful.

"4","/10","""The Marvels"" is the worst Marvel movie. Full of green screen, generic action, humor that does not work and a non developed villain, the movie is more like a horrible ""filler""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9612593/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","9 February 2024","When we look directly at ""The Marvels"", one feeling dominates perceptions: rush. We have a work with three protagonists and a villain, as well as several special appearances, and they all need to fit together to fit throughout its duration. If, on the one hand, the main trio did not need lengthy introductions (these were carried out in ""Captain Marvel"", ""WandaVision"" and ""Ms. Marvel""), on the other hand, the film seems not to know how to distinguish a superfluous excess from an important sequence for character development. , motivations and the like. Everything is presented very quickly, discussed very quickly and resolved very quickly. Director Nia DaCosta simply throws the characters into the action right away, giving quick introductions to them. A highlight is the way Kamala is presented, taking elements from her series, with a small animation that shows how she got her powers and her fascination with Captain Marvel, while at the same time showing what her youthful personality is like. It's fair to say that this also only works because of Iman Vellani's charisma in the role. Yes, the young woman who recently started her career as an actress still has areas to improve, but the charisma and energy she brings to the film is undeniable, as happened in her own series, which despite being bad, works partially thanks to the young actress.In the moments in which it focuses on the protagonists, ""The Marvels"" brings back a great positive point of the MCU so far: the ability to create charismatic figures for the public to identify with and admire. After all, anyone who cried at the end of Iron Man or even fights online about Black Widow is because they found something captivating in the journey of these characters. However, the film also rescues the worst of Marvel Studios, which is the superficial creation of villains and developments, culminating in a forgettable feature. And we already know the reason for this contrast: the eternal struggle between the creation of a production with an authorial feel and the need to be ""another chapter"" in the next phase of the MCU. In this context, director Nia DaCosta has less blame for the registry than it might seem. Although ""The Marvels"", overall, is not a good film, the parts where the director managed to put her vision of the story are obvious, resulting in rare captivating moments. On the other hand, there are very clear sections in which the production had to be cut or reshot, to add or remove something that will be used in the future. So many changes also impact the technical part of the film. Although some of the fight choreography of the three protagonists is interesting, there are bizarre moments in which the villain Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton) literally stands still waiting to be attacked before having any reaction. The visual effects also have problems and are annoying in scenes that could easily be cut or thought of differently. What we see here, basically, are poorly choreographed scenes that consist of characters releasing lightning and powers from their hands at each other, with almost never any more physical and visceral fight. It is the total pasteurization of the action filmed on a green screen, without any emotion or sense of urgency or threat in its entirety.Architecture, clothing and customs are specific and original to each place, and cheesiness is embraced without much embarrassment. In this context, CGI becomes a welcome device, especially because it allows the viewer to truly immerse themselves in this universe, allowing them to see in the light, and not decipher in the darkness, the heroines' cultural clashes. From there it is easy to forgive the inconsistencies that ""The Marvels"" creates in the MCU - the grief, the wife and the crisis created by Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) in the series ""Secret Invasion"", for example, are completely ignored in this production which, in theory, would be a continuation of the series. In fact, as much as it is connected to three other titles - ""Captain Marvel"", ""WandaVision"" and ""Ms. Marvel"" -, the film manages to stand on its own legs, giving the basic context to understand the origin of the dilemmas of its trio of heroines. It's an adventure with a beginning, middle and end, without any major rough edges, and that delivers what it promised in just over an hour and a half. Do you understand how out of line this is for Marvel in recent years? It is also surprising to note how the film's script is not that interested in themes about representation. Unlike works like ""Black Panther"" (and its sequel), ""She-Hulk"" and even Danvers' own solo film, ""The Marvels"" is an extremely unpretentious and light adventure from the studio, without so much interest in cultural discussions, of gender and social commentary. The most notorious and ridiculous thing we see here is the infamous ""Use your power as a black woman"" uttered by Nick Fury at a certain point in the production, totally out of place and making us wonder which of the ""genius"" minds of the women responsible for the script came up with the idea. For this surreal moment in production.Trying to combine action with comedy and drama, DaCosta tries to innovate at Marvel Studios by adding a musical touch as a kind of narrative comic relief. But without any really effective connection with the central plot, the theatricality expressed in two original songs (one of which is still sung by Brie Larson herself) remains adrift, like a loose and lost cut within the film. And this is clear evidence of the film's lack of narrative synergy. Trying to navigate different genres, the filmmaker debuts in the MCU with good intentions, but doesn't quite know how to execute them. And that's one of the biggest problems with ""The Marvels."" Made up of cuts that are sometimes pure children's comedy and sometimes migrate abruptly to drama, the long-awaited sequel to Captain Marvel lacks harmony and balance. His fun and funny takes work in isolation, but are lost within the work as a whole. Having difficulty focusing on her plot, the director tries to embrace different approaches, but never delivers anything completely. The lack of focus on the text and narrative format makes the second act a silly mishmash, which does not compromise the audience's entire experience due to the dynamic between Brie Larson, Teyonah Parris and Iman Vellani.And if Velani enchants immediately and sustains this charm throughout the entire 105 minutes, the uniform she gets on the planet Aladna is unbelievably dark, even though the colors reflect her constant state of mind (which contrasts with the uniform of muted colors that Danvers receives). The CGI is perfectly acceptable, but nothing particularly special, which also has the advantage of the heroines having ""light powers"", which makes everyone's job easier. But what really doesn't work at all is the villain. Remember the already fairly dull Ronan the Accuser (Lee Pace) from the first Guardians of the Galaxy? Well, the Supremor Dar-Benn, who also uses a hammer (or Universal Weapon as Danvers explains to Kahn), is the no-budget version of it. And the problem isn't even in the basic motivation for her to create chaos in the film, but rather how generic she is in every aspect, in a uniform that looks more like it came from a cosplay event or an episode of the ""Power Rangers"" series. "", the makeup, passing through the dialogues and their null depth. Furthermore, Zawe Ashton is frighteningly bad in the role, making faces, mouths and gestures as if she were acting in a play, but without even managing to establish a sense of threat. She even embarrasses others every time she appears on the scene.""The Marvels"" is the worst Marvel movie. During its almost 2-hour duration, the film even tries to explain why the ""new threat"" of the week is so important, with the already well-known Marvel dialogues, full of difficult and barely understandable words. But this does not translate into real dangers. There is an attempt to give emotional weight to the characters and their relationships, but this falls apart when things that seem so important disappear in the blink of an eye. Thus, it is easy to reach the end of ""The Marvels"" without understanding very well how we got there. For the viewer, there is that bitter feeling of having seen a film that, in addition to having no emotional weight and filmed almost entirely in chroma-key with effects well below those expected for a million-dollar Marvel production, disappoints in every other way. The film tries to insert drama, but fails, it tries to insert comedy and only a few scenes actually work (like the cats swallowing people and floating in the air), it tries to insert adventure, which never works with fights that border on the ridiculous because they are so poorly handled. It even tries to be a musical, but this passage is embarrassing on several levels.It's another generic film stuck in a formula that has already become saturated. To disguise it, it tries to insert something of greater relevance to the future of Marvel in cinemas at the end, such as the ""Young Avengers"" and even the ""X-Men"", but this nod does not save ""The Marvels"" from being a disaster, bringing three bland female characters that no one cares about (the catastrophic result at the box office is proof of this). For those who wanted ""female representation"" on the big screen, they only received a film that is pure embarrassment and that even ignores events from the series and other films without the slightest shame or weight on their conscience. It's a film that even when entertaining, suffers most of the time. The feeling that remains is that Marvel needs to stop wanting to insert representation at any cost down its audience's throats (remembering that more than 90% of those who go to see the films and buy comics are men) and urgently reinvent itself by bringing in top-tier characters back, or it may be heading in a direction of no return.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

I don't want to give ammo to the haters. But this movie was not very good at all.All the production woes that were reported behind the scenes are readily apparent in the first act. This movie not only switches the characters but it switches tone on a dime. From action to drama to comedy to being a friggin musical at one part. It's jarring and obnoxious.The villain (played by a game Zawe Ashton) does actually have a fascinating motivation on paper, but she is saddled with cliched villainous dialogue.The special effects are not as terrible as the trailers suggest but the movie is visually not that memorable for a movie that reportedly cost more than $200M. A key plot point is that the three main lead actresses switch places with each other (for reasons). It comes and goes when the plot demands it.Iman Vellani is probably the one cast member who looks happy to be in this movie. She is delightful in her cheerful delivery and just being casually upbeat. Teyonah Parris is left with a sourpuss characterization that doesn't give her room to be her more naturally funny and snarky persona.Brie Larson, probably the most hated actress in the MCU, is actually more personable as Carol Danvers compared to her first appearance. SLJ returns as Nick Fury but he's just kind of there to react to things. The less said about Kamala Khan's annoying family, the better.This movie is indicative of all the problems facing the Marvel Cinematic Universe right now. It has a thin plot, poorly directed action, and uninteresting characters. It just takes a cool concept and makes it less cool.

Despite the antagonist lacking the gravitas to justify the team-up, observing 'The Marvels' navigating through the tumultuous circumstances imparts a delightful and lighthearted charm. Notably, the film boasts the distinction of being the MCU's briefest cinematic venture, a runtime that proves advantageous by mitigating the risk of redundancy.While the ensemble cast delivers performances that are predominantly perfunctory, Iman Vellani's portrayal of Ms. Marvel stands out as a luminous highlight.In essence, ""The Marvels"" presents a tapestry of disorder, marked by moments of inconsistency and both positive and negative doses of chaos, contributing to an overall experience that, while mostly forgettable, retains a certain appeal.5/10.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The intro action sequence could have had minor improvements, but it did a great job of making me excited for the rest of the movie. Unlike most of the top IMDb reviews, I thought Nick Fury's climax was incredible, but only because they fully committed to the absurdity, and this scene is the only reason I rated this movie as high as I did.The biggest problem is that everything is completely forgettable. I watched it last night, and I already can't tell you the villan's name. Ms Marvel is a likable character, but there isn't one single person in the movie that is given any sort of character development or backstory that isn't already shown in their other shows or movies. The only non-Earth planet that I can remember anything about, I only remember it because it had the potential to be just as memorable and enjoyable as Nick Fury's arc, but as soon as they introduced it, they chickened out and went back to boring normalcy instead of fully committing.The second biggest problem is that anyone with an intro course understanding of physics would continuously cringe at the dozens of times that the most basic laws of physics are completely broken and ignored.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

And what never ceases to amaze me is that even though a movie is clearly bad, like say when it bombs in theaters, there are still tons of people giving this movie high ratings. Hollywood has gotten to the point where it churns out so many bad movies that I'm actually shocked when something is good!The previous film, Captain Marvel, wasnt too bad so it doesnt make a whole lot of sense why The Marvels is so far off the mark. I find Iman Vellani's character so annoying. And that's another point I want to make. Why would you make a movie with characters from a tv show that so many people did not like?

I'm loving the new Ms Marvel character. Her show on Disney+ is really good, and it was nice to see how they integrated her storyline with her idol Captain Marvel. Very much a Spider-Man / Iron Man vibe. It gave Captain Marvel a lot more warmth, IMO, she can come across too dry, but her relationship with the other two main characters gave her some depth and humor. I took a group of teens and tweens to see it with me, boys and girls, and they all had a good time. Some in our family are big Marvel fans, some are not, but everyone liked it. The audience - who looked to cover a range of ages, all seemed to enjoy it and laughed and gasped at appropriate parts.

First of all, I'd like to point out that I did actually walk into this film with an open mind, I've seen how much hate this film got before it even released and I find it so unfair that people have already formed their opinions on a film they never gave the chance to view. Nonetheless I watched it without any bias and still didn't care for it.Before I get into what didn't work for me in this film, let me get the good stuff out of the way. The action was cool I guess. And I absolutely love Iman Villani as Kamala Khan, she adapts the Ms. Marvel I'be always enjoyed in the original comic book series. I still haven't accepted her power changes, I think it's a little disrespectful to the source material. Regardless, Iman Villani definitely has potential for this character in the future, and I'm excited to see what they do with her.With that out of the way, what did I dislike about this film? Well for starters, there wasn't actually any character development in any way, and the established team in this film suffers from undeveloped chrome amongst our protagonists. Captain Marvel rarely struggles in fights, which is what makes most of the action sequences so underwhelming. There was one moment in this film where the villain took a character and actually had that person's life at stake, but apart from that and another character's sacrifice towards the end of this film, there are little stakes. But at least there were actual consequences.Marvel still suffers with weak special effects, and that mainly lies with the CGI portions. Marvel, please let your special effects team finish their work before releasing a film, I know you love quantity over quality, but some people would appreciate a film with proper visuals.I can see people enjoying this movie and having a good time watching it, but this was definitely a miss for me personally. This film seems to set up some cool ideas for the future of Marvel, but apart from that this is just another skippable Marvel film. If you're just looking for a good time, then I think you might enjoy this, but as a stand-alone movie with a compelling story to tell, then I think this is something you might wanna skip.Marvel seems to have postponed a lot of their films to 2025 (with the exception of Deadpool 3 releasing next year), and that may be due to the strike that just ended, but I still hope that gives special effects team in Marvel Studios enough time to do there job and make some of their superhero movies visually appealing to the human eyes. Of course, I'd hope the screenwriters have a good story to tell along with those hopefully good visuals.","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

The singing people .. that's interesting?

When Carol, Monica & Kamala switch places whenever they use their powers, they have to join forces to save the universe, from the villainous Dar-Benn(Zawe Ashton).The Marvels is a marvelous film. Director Nia DaCosta has given us a movie that is downright hilarious most of the time & yet has its poignant moments. It's definitely not one of the Marvel Cinematic Universe's best. However, it's in the top twenty & doesn't deserve some of the harsh reviews coming its way. The action set pieces are mind-blowing & look even better in IMAX 3D. The visual effects are brilliant. Brie Larson is outstanding as Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. Teyonah Parris is phenomenal as Monica Rambeau. Iman Vellani is spectacular as Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel. The effortless camaraderie among Larson, Parris & Vellani's characters, is the highlight of the film. Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic as Nick Fury. Zawe Ashton is good as Dar-Benn. Zenobia Shroff, Mohan Kapur & Saagar Shaikh are amazing as Muneeba Khan, Yusuf Khan & Aamir Khan, respectively. The supporting cast is unforgettable. The Marvels is a must watch for Marvel Cinematic Universe fans. It expands the universe in jaw-dropping ways. Can't wait for what comes next!","63 out of 206 found this helpful.

Felt no chemistry between any of the characters let alone the actors. The villain was basic. Ms. Marvel is a bit too childish. Captain Marvel's acting is flat and emotionless. Monica Rambeau feels like she doesn't want to be in ANY scene. Ultimately, a very poor excuse for a movie in the once great MCU. Plot holes liter the entire movie, with no consistency on their power switching as well as odd tone shifts. The editing was all over the map and at times confusing during fight scenes. The CGI was on par or even below the quality of the CW and low budget 90s films. Lastly, the last scene of the movie is a massive pass for me on building any type of excitement or emotion for future films. I hope someday the MCU and Hollywood in general can return to good story telling with good characters, not just agendas and inclusive casting. Just tell a good dang story again with good actors and characters. If you're gonna make a bad movie, at least make it fun. This movie was awful and not even remotely interesting. -10/10, would not recommend, even on my most bored Sunday.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The idea that the Marvels get ""entangled"" leads to some funny moment, but gets stale pretty quickly.The biggest problem for the movie is that the villain lacks by writing and by casting. Like Thanos, the villain has reasonable motive, but frankly, you don't need an ulterior motive for the villain, when a selfish one does just fine. There is no outsmarting the heroes and for some odd reason the heroes always know which target is next.Another problem is that no hero in herself is given time and script to be presented in a way that the audience could be interested in them. Ms. Marvel has the additional problem that she has to be the fangirl all through the movie, making Jar Jar Binks look like a chill character in comparison.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The CG special effects look fake for most of their appearance. The cinematography is conventional and a few visuals manage to stand out. The music composed for the film goes unnoticed. Nia DaCosta's direction is weak (she had achieved a great first feature film and now with her second film she fails to direct it). The acting is average, this is due to how poorly the characters are written. The only really fun thing in this movie is Goose the cat and something to highlight is the animation during the end credits, the rest is just a production that doesn't achieve anything special.

I didn't much care for it. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. It sits somewhere in between mediocrity and fun. I loved the Ms. Marvel bits, but only because I saw the show and was aware of her. I think she's a precious cinnamon roll that must be protected at all cost, but I digress. In a franchise that at thier worst was a little bland but visually stunning, this ine phoned in the special effects (I'm sure the animators must have been over worked and under paid likewise for the writing team) The dialog felt forced and unnatural most times. Unpopular opinion, but I am a fan of Brie Larson, she has the chops to be amazing, but she feels stilted, especially when the suit comes on. But worst if all was Tayonna Parris' Monica Rambo. She was great in WandaVision I felt her pain and wanted her story to have some weight, all we got here was some awkward drama and she felt one note. It wasn't until the post credits that she felt like an actual character. And don't get me started on the supporting cast. (I don't think Marvel knows what to do with Fury anymore) overall, I don't want to hate this movie but it's there at the bottom alongside Black Widow and The Eternals as bland and uninspired. And thay hurts to say. Maybe a rewrite here and there and fleshing out some of the charactersmight have worked. The villain of the piece, though. I get they all don't have to be relatable or scary, but they have to have a presence. Weather hamming it up or being intimidating they have to be a foil. This forgetable villain had nothibg going for them despite actually having a good reason to be. The movie as a whole felt like there was potential, but just fell short in so many ways.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Not sure why people disliked this movie so strongly and personally there's no way this is the worst Marvel movie ever. Not a hope! It's pretty damn good, it's nicely paced, acting is incredible, has some ACTUAL funny moments, Fantastic, believable villain and such LOVABLE characters. Not to mention it looks great and just has a VIBE..
I almost didn't watch this when I saw the reviews and it's IMDB score as I didn't want to put myself through another Marvel disappointment. (Most of us can agree there's been quiet a few of those recently) However what I cannot agree on is that this is one of those disappointments.This is my take of what I watched and I cannot reiterate enough, I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish.I've never been a huge or even 'little 'Captain Marvel fan but after watching this I have a new appreciation and love for Carol Danvers. This was definitely my favourite Brie Larson interpretation of the Character so far, and I think we get to see the real Carol Danvers for the first time rather than just the Hero Captain Marvel.Previously to watching 'The Marvels' I did love the characters of Monica Rambeau and Kamala Khan and feel that Teyonah Parris and Iman Vellani do a great job playing these characters in their shows, WandaVision and Ms Marvel. I thought both actors did a fantastic job in this movie too and created a great onscreen chemistry with one another and Brie Larson as Carol Danvers. The 3 ladies' onscreen relationship was wholesome as f** and comedic at times too. 10/10 on that note.This brings me to my next point, if you haven't already watched WandaVision, Ms Marvel, or the Captain Marvel movie - watch those before watching this movie, you WILL enjoy it 100 times more. This is one of my guesses for why there are such low reviews for this movie as maybe some of those viewers hadn't seen these other instalments beforehand.I do feel like Marvel is again rewarding us for having watched their previous shows/movies as it felt like there was a lot of nods and winks to previous shows and movies in this one. I mean, for one, I know anyone seeing the Flerken for the 1st time is not going to appreciate what unfolds as much as I did.Ms Marvel, is such a great show and the character is awesome so is the entire cast in the show. Do not underestimate the hilarity of somewhat conservative and extremely worrisome parents when their daughter becomes a super hero. It's ace and the appearance of Kamalas family in The Marvels made sense given her age and the story however equally they were a welcome addition to it and rocked.The Villain.. led by a desire for revenge and an unwavering sense of righteousness ? Pretty old school, not much to say other than it worked for me and that Zawe Ashton did an incredible job as Dar-Benn.Overall it's definitely worth the watch, especially if you're a Marvel fanatic. If you're not but dip in and out, go watch the shows first and you'll enjoy this all the more.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

Why someone didn't just say to the Director, this is crazy, please don't! I don't understand, but that was it for me.

Assemble for The Marvels, a celestial adventure promising to unite Captain Marvel, Monica Rambeau, and Ms. Marvel. Does it soar to the heights of previous MCU epics, or leave you grounded with disappointment? Buckle up, True Believers, and let's chart a course through this intergalactic odyssey.While the narrative juggles three powerful heroines, their journeys feel less like a harmonious ensemble and more like individuals struggling to align. The plot, ambitious yet overused, throws timelines, villains, and character development into a cosmic blender, resulting in a somewhat muddled concoction.While not visually catastrophic, the film's special effects occasionally suffer from budgetary nebulae, leaving some action sequences feeling more like B-movie meteors than dazzling supernovae. Additionally, the narrative pacing can be uneven, with stretches of exposition dragging down the momentum like rogue asteroids. Still, moments of humor and genuine heroics manage to break through the cosmic dust, reminding us why we love these characters and the MCU in the first place.So, should you embark on this interstellar voyage? If you're a die-hard MCU fan desperate for your next superhero fix, The Marvels might offer a moderately entertaining diversion. Think of it as a fun space romp with some familiar faces, but manage your expectations accordingly. Don't anticipate a groundbreaking narrative or groundbreaking visuals. But if you're yearning for an emotional gut punch or a cinematic masterpiece, you might be left wishing you were rewatching Infinity Saga instead.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Stealing every scene she's in is Ms Marvel (gotta go back and watch that series now to catch up). Captain Marvel and the not yet named third member of the group are wonderfully cast alongside Nick Fury in what is now the shortest film in the series (a movie should only be as long or a short as the story demands, and this was on target).It's not my favorite Marvel movie, but it's a lot better than half of them.

"4","/10","Not a good film, but certainly a good time","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9449064/?ref_=tt_urv","DeanAmythe","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur170935686/?ref_=tt_urv","22 November 2023","The most dedicated a Marvel movie has been to its central mechanic since Ant-Man and the Wasp - so it shouldn't come as much of a surprise that this is probably one of the most entertaining and funniest ones of these we've gotten lately. Highlights are when it completely commits to its own absurdity or the leads play off of each other, in words and in action, though I have my gripes with both. Most of this is still the usual expository slog you've come to expect from this franchise, in this instance made even worse by the incessant use of in-universe jargon that, even as someone who has trudged through nearly all of it leading up to this, makes the dialogue, and the plot it means to build, almost incomprehensible. Just try reading the film's description on the page here and you'll have a good idea of what I mean.The action scenes themselves are pretty fun when they use the 'switch' gimmick, which lends itself to dynamically choreographed fights - though, as usual, it's rarely used to its full potential- but most of it suffers from the increasingly prevalent problem these films have been facing, where most of these powers are fantasy fluff that fall beyond the realm of my grasp. The Avengers days, where every hero felt appropriately 'super' yet still abided by grounded logic, are far behind us. Here, I'm at a loss as to what strength a beam of light has or what our main players could be hurt and damaged by.I truly want to give this a higher score, but the occasional laugh and directorial flourishes like intermittent use of splitscreen (being very generous here calling attention to something so barebones) aren't enough to distract from the truly terrible script that seems as lacking in logic and consistency as its heroes' powers and the overall feeling like this was just a box to tick so the MCU can move to other things, a mere link to be made between. I think unabashedly hating this is a little harsh - it's pretty much non-stop action apart from an exposition dump in the midpoint and clocks in at a tidy 105 minutes (making it the shortest mainline MCU feature). Not a good film, but certainly a good time.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

Picture this: a movie that feels like it's battling an identity crisis, trying to merge four different films into one. That's the vibe I got from this sequel that, honestly, should've just stayed as an idea in the production room. It's as if they gambled on what direction to take and ended up lost in space. With multiple delays and a bloated budget, you'd expect a smoother flight, right?Kamala, bless her, shines through the tangled mess-rising above a script that did her no favors, she's the MVP in a game where the rules are all over the place. The action sequences flip-flop between ""Oh, cool!"" and ""Wait, what am I watching?""-a testament to a production that's seen better days.The movie's like that one joke that falls flat in a quiet room-every character's trying to be the funny one, and it's crickets all around. Even with the post-credits scene, it's more of a ""meh"" than a ""wow"". And don't get me started on the CGI-it's so glaring, it's practically another character.We've got Brie Larson, who seems more at ease in her superhero gear, but even she can't salvage this ship. Nick Fury's turned into a punchline, and the villain? So forgettable, I'm already asking, ""Who was it again?""But the real Razzie-worthy moment? A scene that's a low-budget homage to the Wizard of Oz. It's like the movie's problems got their own featurette. And that cat scene? Let's just say it's a whole song and dance that nobody asked for.In short, this one's a tough sell-even for the die-hards. It's a bit of a heartache to see the MCU hit this note, especially when we know the symphony they're capable of. Here's to hoping the next one finds its way back to the magic we know and love.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

The film tries to juggle too many characters and subplots, resulting in a messy and incoherent story that lacks focus and direction. The film follows Carol Danvers (Brie Larson), Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris), and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani) as they team up to stop a Kree threat that involves a mysterious wormhole and a rogue Skrull faction. The film is directed by Nia DaCosta, who fails to inject any flair or originality into the superhero genre.The film's biggest problem is its lack of character development and emotional depth. The three protagonists have little chemistry and personality, and their motivations and arcs are poorly established and resolved. Carol Danvers is reduced to a bland and boring hero who has no personal stake in the conflict. Monica Rambeau is a generic and forgettable sidekick who has a strained relationship with her aunt Carol. Kamala Khan is an annoying and naive fan-girl who has a crush on Carol and idolises her as a role model. The film does not explore the potential of their powers or their identities as women of colour in a male-dominated world.The film's action scenes are also uninspired and repetitive, relying on CGI and explosions to create spectacle. The film does not offer any memorable or creative set pieces, and the final battle is a clichéd and anticlimactic showdown with a generic villain. The film's humour is also forced and unfunny, relying on cheap jokes and references to pop culture. The film's attempts to be relevant and progressive are also superficial and pandering, as it tries to appeal to a diverse and young audience without any substance or nuance.The Marvels is a wasted opportunity to expand on the cosmic and fantastical aspects of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is a bland and boring film that fails to deliver on its promise of being a fun and empowering adventure. It is a film that does not deserve the title of ""The Marvels"". I give it two stars out of ten.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Captain Marvel was mediocre at best. Ms Marvel was just plain terrible. The bad dude in this is a Woman called Dar Benn. She is possibly the worst actress I have ever witnessed. I found it quite amusing here and there. And it's not as bad as Thor Love and Thunder. Which is the worst Marvel movie of all time. But it was light on plot. Disjointed and just a bit too silly for my liking. A whole family of Khans in space? Give me a break. And Kamala's incessant fan girling was just plain annoying. If she screamed hysterically once. She did it a hundred times. I just find everything about Ms Marvel to be irritating. This movie even pushes fury's character into the realms of parody which is unacceptable. I feel sorry for Brie Larsson. It must be so difficult to bring anything authentic and believable to such a flacid character. The bit with the cats sums The Marvels up for me. Stupid and pointless rubbish. Terrible plot. Terrible acting. Terrible attempts at comedy. Just not as bad as Love and Thunder or it would have had a 2 as well.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I also don't mind more middle eastern representation, but Kamala (""Ms Marvel"") is a strange character that just kinda mimics/imitates that of Spiderman without the flair, background or any real powers, or at least my understanding was that she gets her powers from her bracelet(s), which doesn't really make her a superhero. I guess there are comparative examples in Dr. Strange and Ironman, but they were super smart, and others like Hawkeye and Black Widow earned their superhero status. So yeah, not my favorite character.Overall extremely disappointing.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

It was nice to have a not too serious comic book movie that didn't have the awful humour of Love & Thunder.Carol Danvers is an odd character whom I struggle to like at times but I think she worked really well in the trio. The fight scenes were good even though Carol felt like she'd been nerfed - probably because having an all powerful hero (like Superman) is boring.Kamala and Monica are great additions to the MCU and were very well played imo. Kamala balances out Carol's energy perfectly and I am so intrigued to see where Monica's storyline goes next.If you're expecting something emotional and dark like Infinity War/Endgame/No Way Home then you'll be disappointed. The plot is simple but it works, and it doesn't take itself too seriously which is a blessing amongst the angst of the other Marvel movies/series being released at the moment. There is some comic book nonsense which is extremely entertaining to watch and quite refreshing amongst all the other bad movies we've had recently.Overall I think comic book movies should be allowed to have fun once in a while, and this was a really good way to do it.Note: The group I watched The Marvels with ranged in genders & age (26-33), the lowest rating of us all being 7/10.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

They don't even bother now to give any sort of explanation to anyone's power, it's a free for all, there are more people with some sort of super ability than regular people, and they get these powers in such random and nonsensical fashion it's laughable.And what on Earth was that musical scene, it was so cringe I almost had to fast forward... I know it's hard to produce good content after the success of the last avengers movies but are the people working at Marvel just keep pushing bad movies with bad CGI and the same old story to earn some bucks in the hopes another multi super hero saga catches on again...?

The villain is your typical bad guy without much depth or originality, making it hard to get invested in the conflict. The plot follows a familiar formula, with predictable twists and turns that don't offer much excitement or surprise.However, there is one aspect of the film that stands out: the teleportation powers. These abilities add some much-needed excitement and intrigue to the story, making for some cool action sequences and clever plot points. It's a neat gimmick that adds a layer of fun to an otherwise uninspired movie.Overall, while ""The Marvels"" has its moments, it doesn't quite live up to its potential. With a generic villain and a predictable plot, it struggles to leave a lasting impression.

For the positives, Brie Larson's Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel makes her long awaited return after traveling the galaxy alone since Avengers: Endgame and I have to say, her character definitely feels more fleshed out here than in the original Captain Marvel film and I was glad to see her return overall. The standout star of the entire film though had to be Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel. She steals the show in every scene she is in and shines the brightest out of the main stars. Teyonah Parrish also returns as Monica Rambeau and makes her long awaited superhero debut as Photon, while also having some of the best moments of the film as well. The chemistry between the main three actresses work overall and I was glad to see them finally come together on the big screen. The visuals for the most part were breathtaking while also stunning as well. For the negatives, Samuel L Jackson returns as Nick Fury after being last seen in Secret Invasion which I was not a fan of and after seeing him in this, as much as I like him as a actor, Nick Fury was definitely not needed for this film and he gives probably the worst performance of his entire career in this film. It felt like the Nick Fury we got here compared to Secret Invasion are two entirely separate characters. Also the villian Dar-Benn played by Zawe Ashton was probably one of the most poorly written and worst villains to ever come to the MCU. When it comes to the plot choices and dialogue, some of the choices made were obviously not the right ones and the dialogue was also some of the worst I've ever heard in a film period. Overall, The Marvels succeeded with bringing our three main hero's to the big screen in style while also setting up what's to come in the future, but with poorly written plot choices, bad dialogue, unnecessary characters, and a weak villain, makes this film below average for a MCU film.

I really enjoyed it. It had action and comedy and I think that all the girls did a great job. People need to get over themselves and go to the movies as a fun night out. My Son reads the comics and he says that they did a good job following the story. Sometimes when a movie is really bad I feel like I will never get those 2 hours back but I didn't feel that way when this movie ended. I was disappointed to read all the negativity. It seems that now a days all you get is criticism about everything. It's a movie people, just enjoy it and don't analyze it so much.","24 out of 75 found this helpful.

Mostly the first ones with Iron Man and Thor. I heard this movie was fun so me and my wife watched it together.I felt like I would have needed to see the previous movies because I struggled to follow along. The characters aren't introduced, you are assumed to know who everyone is. There are references to things that has happened - I assume - in previous movies. It felt like coming into a TV Series mid season. Without anyone to explain it all, I felt excluded and like this movie was made primarily for people who already love marvel movies and have watched all of them.It was a fun comedy but I didn't really get the story or motivations for anything going on. The cat was cute. I wish more superheros had pets. That's why I really liked Guardians of the Galaxy. I love the racoon. Even though he's technically not a pet. Still cute.I heard this was a really expensive movie but the alien people look like they're from an episode of old star trek with silly ears and green or blue skin. Which would be fine if the movie had the budget and charm of old star trek. But an expensive movie should look more realistic in my opinion.And again, who are all these alien people? No clue. We don't get any context unless you are already a die hard fan or studied Wikipedia before trying to enjoy this movie. You shouldn't have to study to enjoy a movie. I could enjoy Lord of the Rings without reading the books first.The lack of context made it hard to feel engaged.This is why I don't see these superhero movies. And maybe you'll love it if you are already a religiously dedicated fan but otherwise I would say you should watch something else.I also found the portrayal of the Indian family a bit offensive. Just because it's a comedy everyone doesn't have to be silly and stupid.Let's also talk about the tonality. Because it is a comedy it feels like the serious scenes are a bit too abrupt to let your emotions adapt. It's probably really hard to walk that line well, but good comedies have to have some sort of serious aspect to them. Even the lego movies have this.And the musical part feels really out of place. Like a silly episode from Buffy or some other TV series. Maybe because Marvel is Disney now they had to add it? Or is this a kids movie and I missed that? The old marvel movies were for adults so I thought this one was too.I'm glad we saw it on Disney+ or I would have felt cheated on my money.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Well I rated 2 stars because my wife and I love cats, or else it would be 1 star.First start eith story writing. It's as a young kid has been asked a story for first time. Dialogue are simplistic and jokes failes to put a smile on your face. But most importantly the whole point to the story could easily be prevented. One more thing about the story, usually we get to know the villain with some background story and how they became to be and the Marvels had this to minimum. I mean for 250 million dollar movie you expect them to have a great story.When they introduced some new planets and cultures in other movies, Xandar, Hala, it was well thought got us excited unlike this movie (a musical planet, wow, creativity is dead at Marvel).I found acting weirdly bad even from Samuel L. Jackson. It also felt like Brie Larson was forced to play this role and she just did it because she has a contract.Special effects are no way near what Marvel movies normally have, if was either rushed or done cheaply.We used to go and watch marvel movies in theatres on first weekend after release. Because of the tthe circumstances we haven't been able to so now we watch on Disny plus or Amazon, whichever comes out first. After last few movies I've seen with the exception of the Guardians of the Galaxy I think I will not be going to theatres to watch marvel movies until I'm convinced they are back on track with their movies.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"4","/10","A Mixed Bag of Heroic Moments and Missed Opportunities","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9575801/?ref_=tt_urv","arsalanweb","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44739822/?ref_=tt_urv","20 January 2024","""The Marvels"" is a cinematic experience that left me torn between moments of awe and frustration. Directed by the talented Nia DaCosta, the film brings together an ensemble cast of characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) in an ambitious attempt to weave multiple storylines into one cohesive narrative. While the film certainly has its shining moments, it ultimately falls short of delivering a truly satisfying superhero spectacle.One of the film's strengths lies in its visual appeal. The special effects and action sequences are nothing short of spectacular, showcasing the technological prowess of the film industry. The intricate details of the superhero suits, along with the breathtaking CGI landscapes, contribute to the immersive nature of the movie. The cinematography and direction elevate certain scenes to a level of visual poetry, providing viewers with a feast for the eyes.However, where ""The Marvels"" stumbles is in its narrative execution. The attempt to juggle multiple storylines simultaneously becomes overwhelming, leading to a disjointed and confusing plot. The film struggles to find a balance between character development and advancing the overarching narrative, leaving some characters feeling underutilized and underdeveloped.Additionally, the pacing of the film is inconsistent, making it challenging to stay engaged throughout its runtime. Moments of intense action are abruptly interrupted by lengthy exposition, disrupting the flow of the story and causing the viewer to lose connection with the characters.The performances of the cast are a mixed bag. While some actors deliver powerful and emotionally resonant portrayals, others seem to struggle with the uneven script. The chemistry between certain characters is palpable, providing moments of genuine connection, but these instances are overshadowed by the overall lack of cohesion in the storytelling.""The Marvels"" attempts to introduce new elements to the MCU, but the execution leaves much to be desired. Some plot twists feel forced, and the inclusion of certain characters appears more like a marketing strategy than a natural progression of the narrative.In conclusion, ""The Marvels"" is a visually stunning yet narratively flawed addition to the MCU. While it has its moments of brilliance, the film falls short of meeting the high expectations set by its predecessors. It's a rollercoaster of emotions that, unfortunately, spends too much time navigating loops and turns, leaving the audience with a sense of disorientation and dissatisfaction. A 4/10 rating reflects the film's missed potential and its struggle to find a harmonious balance between spectacle and substance.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Excitable, super-enthusiastic, awkward Kamala reminded me of Peter Parker in the Marvel iterations, and her relationship to Danvers is not unlike that of Peter with Iron Man, without feeling as derivative as the rest of the film, somehow. Getting a fresh character with an outsider's perspective on our heroes is always a welcome idea, and it works well here. The singing planet and the cats are very fun too, and they reminded me (a thought that flashed through my bored mind while watching ""Dr. Strange in the Multiverse of Madness"" and ""Quantumania"" mostly) of how much I wish Marvel would let go and get farther off the beaten path towards more fanciful and whimsical territory (à la WandaVision).The drama on the other hand feels forced and incoherent, both on the small scale (the half-hearted tension between Danvers and Rambeau) and big. Danvers never seems that concerned with the consequences of her actions and tidily resolves at the end a situation that should not be so easily solvable (otherwise there is no real dramatic weight and never really was). This in essence is formulaic plotting and weak dramaturgy at their very worst. Perhaps the most problematic however is how, like many other installments, the villain is only a mediocre adversary with rotten character motivation. That in turn prevents our superheroes from shining or proving their moral worth as they should.Oh well, at least there's the cats.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I found Brie Larson wooden in her acting, uncommitted to the overall ensemble that is the MCU, and overall a misstep in casting. I was happily proven wrong with The Marvels, and I believe it is all due to the casting of Iman as Ms. Marvel. Iman is the most inspired casting choice since RDJ and Chris Evans. She absolutely steals every scene she is in, and it is apparent that her infectious enthusiasm about being in the MCU inspired Brie and even the legend Sam Jackson to have more fun in their roles. Far from perfect, but far from being as bad as the box office and the incel reviews here would suggest, The Marvels replicated the joy of reading comics as a kid that only the first Avengers movie gave me. It finally sold me on Brie as Captain Marvel, and it made me love the character of Ms. Marvel, whom I previously didn't care much for.","9 out of 23 found this helpful.

The lack of a coherent narrative and underdeveloped characters make it clear that this film missed the mark by a wide margin. It's disheartening to witness a once-beloved franchise veer so far off course.If this is the trajectory Marvel Studios intends to continue, count me out.

I was into this movie at first, but when they all started singing, I had to tap out.It's one of those films that assumes you've memorized the entire superhero universe, including all the characters from every movie and spin-off series. Honestly, there are so many of them that it's hard to keep track, and I don't have time for that. And then they throw in a power swap, which just gets on my nerves after a while.And can we talk about the comedy? I get it, humor is essential, but now it's like they're trying too hard. It used to work when it was subtle and dry, delivered by the right actors. But now, it's just too much, almost forced. I miss the darker vibes of classics like Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight and Zack Snyder's take on Superman and Batman.I'm also craving a simpler, classic story structure. Something that doesn't require me to rewatch a bunch of previous movies or look up explanations on YouTube. Why the obsession with multiverses and complex plots?Sadly, this movie falls into the same category as recent superhero letdowns-like the last Antman, Thor, and Flash. The earlier versions were fantastic, but it's like they lost the heart of the story in the latest ones. It feels like they're trying to please everyone by throwing in too much, and in the end, it's just a messy jumble. My armchair advice? Keep it simple.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

No, seriously. Hundreds of hours of MCU viewing are required before starting this movie.The very best thing I could say about The Marvels was...I didn't hate Carol Danvers this go-around. In fact, she was probably my favorite character of the movie and that's saying a lot as she was absolutely insufferable in her debut movie. So much so, Captain Marvel remains as my least favorite MCU movie of the 33 made so far.I can't say much more positive about this mess. It wasn't the worst (okay, there's a backhanded compliment,) but a ton of this was just dumb. It felt like an entire season of some obscure MCU show on Disney+ that virtually no one would watch all packed into 105 minutes. OH! That's another actual compliment: it was mercifully under 2-hours.The Marvels does an incredibly lousy job of introducing/reintroducing audiences to the world of Captain Marvel and her two sidekicks. The synopsis is all over the place, but suffice to say, one lame villain is seeking revenge and trying to wreak havoc on the universe and only these three heroes can stop her. Never mind we live in a universe of countless Avengers, but I digress.Sorry, I refuse to do research/homework before watching a movie. If the writers can't explain plots/subplots to a potentially new audience, then it is poorly written. Virtually nothing is explained here and unless you've watched multiples of hours of backstories, you'll just have to accept these people over here are the innocents, these are the heroes, these are the villains, etc. No attachments needed, just accept what you're shown.A lot of people praised the Ms. Marvel character and she was fine. She was literally a female Peter Parker, but I didn't mind her. Boring but also fine was the character of Monica Rambeu. Nick Fury fizzled out and literally no other character was worthy of mentioning.I commented that a lot of this was dumb and one of those ideas was a singing race of people. WOW, that was a rough scene. Also, dumb: false threats like having to evacuate a ship for...reasons? Captain Marvel being Superman x 11 in her first movie being reduced to barely a superhero this time around - until the story needed her to be Superman x 11 again. And while it's not the story, the editing was dumb and made the movie even more confusing.Again, I absolutely hated 2019's Captain Marvel, but honestly, I might rewatch that one over ever seeing this chaos again. At least there was a straightforward storyline that was more interesting, familiar and contained a far more compelling Nick Fury.For all the times the DCEU was trying to catchup/mimic the MCU, at least DC is doing the right thing with rebooting after a string of failures. I truly wish the MCU would take 5 years off and come back with something new. Ever since Endgame, there's been 11 MCU movies. While some were okay, most have been awful. Only Spider-Man: No Way Home and Black Panther: Wakanda Forever have been great.This is truly a skip. You're missing absolutely nothing by leapfrogging this one and heading right into Deadpool 3.***Final Thoughts: That all said, I originally vowed to never see this after hating the first Captain Marvel movie so much, but I'm not 100% upset that I did finally see it. As previously revealed, I actually didn't hate her character this time. She wasn't the completely unlikable or unapproachable arrogant B she was in the original this time around. She was, in fact, the complete opposite.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

We waited 5 years for this? It was so bad, the whole movie feels like a filler movie with literally ZERO significance to the whole Marvel universe apart from the final scene which was also super random. The acting was so bland from the two adults, while Kamala is actually the bright point of the movie, the rest, including Nick Fury and the antagonist are so incredibly bland and lack lusted. Nick was only there for comedic purposes, and I feel like he has lost his poignant from the previous movies. The antagonist was so random and so incredibly boring. I don't even know how she becomes the antagonist and how she could hold up a fight against someone who literally flew through battleships like they were paper-thin. Then the final battle was so anticlimatic, like she took on 3 superheroes, 2 of which are possibly some of the most powerful in the entire MCU, like where is the logic?The movie feels disconnected, incredibly cheap, with storylines all over the place, and you just don't feel connected with the characters what so ever. It's funny at place, but 99% of the movie is just random and wasteful of the talents of the cast.I'm glad I hold off going to the cinema and wait for it to come out on Disney because I would never pay to go see this. 2/10.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

But I have to admit the liver is pretty bad......that is...if you are the historical norm fan base. Males (both older and younger). But that in and of itself doesn't make this movie bad. After all, I watched and enjoyed plenty 1970's and 1980's superhero movies. Many made for tv release. And even then they were corny and nothing any adult would watch. But that's the point. They were aimed at kids.The marvels is just as corny...just better props and CGI. But like mentioned before...it's audience based. My wife groans when marvel anything comes on. Yet when this played, she said nothing but good things (like laugh, repeat lines and be excited at girls kicking butt)I take this as the marvel genre and action in general is so depleted of content women like. Or having the cast be predominantly women and women very thing else being subservient to their mission/plot/script. Something that up until the last decade was always the reverse.As a guy, I find no character I really like because for one, I am an adult and this was clearly made for kids. Even by marvel standards. It plays more like a tv show if made for tv movie. And because it caters more to women...it felt soapy.While it was a solid 1 for me
I rate it a 4 because it's a step in the right direction. Where more lanes if entertainment are being opened. So everyone can identify with the lead(s) actor. But, for the money they spent in this movie....at better quality is needed for the ladies if my house. And if made better. I think all audiences might have enjoyed it.There is really strong female characters and stories that have been made. Use those as blueprints.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Iman Vellani's portrayal is a revelation, infusing the character with depth and charm. Brie Larson's return as Captain Marvel is a triumphant display of her acting prowess, satisfying the anticipation of fans like myself who admire her talent. Zawe Ashton's casting as Loki's wife is a stroke of genius, as her performance adds a layer of complexity to the narrative. Teyonah Parris, as Maria Rambabu, steals scenes with her compelling presence. The film's narrative contribution to the Marvel Cinematic Universe is monumental, offering a rich tapestry of storytelling that expands the franchise's horizons.

The trope is not overplayed and unlike overly excitable characters in the past they don't overdo it to the point of annoyance.We get to see more of the universe form unique planets and aliens to families craters. They looks great and each has a unique personality. They actually manage to showcase worlds and cultures that are not cookie cutter version of ones we have seen over and over again. The movie also doesn't take itself too seriously. At times it feels more connected to GOTG then the MCU as a whole.Where this move dose fall short is the villain. We again see the Kree as the villain. She's not menacing and her motives are less about doing back things but helping her people in the wrong way.

There are some good moments, the action sequences when they swap places are energetic and fast paced, and the short amount of time the 3 characters are on the ship together is fun.

At the start it feels kinda force but eventually they do turn into a well running team. Also the ending scene was pretty cold.Marvel movies usually do have pretty lazy writing but this really takes the cake. The dialogue wasn't the wort ever but it wasn't great either. The whole explain through some random mind bracelet really annoyed me. Really don't need so much pointless exposition. Also who was the villian in this movie. I finished the movie an hour ago and I couldn't tell you a single thing about them. What was their name? What was their goal? Why were they evil? I've literally no idea.

I streamed this movie through Disney+ and I still wish I could have my money and time back. The only thing that was nice is that Brie Larson felt human in this. That's it. That's the only redeeming aspect. Even then they didn't give us nearly enough of why she's better. Or proper character development and conflict resolution.Bad Storytelling
Bad Worldbuilding
Bad Explanations (if any)
Bad Antagonist Development
Mediocre Costuming
Decent Sfx / cgi for the Heroes only.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I loved the high-quality visual and sound effects, and the performance of our three heroines, they have Great chemistry. The Marvels represents a triumph. The depth it offers can be seen not only in its characters, but also in its story, which explores the complex repercussions of war and the funny and interwoven virtues of family. The strength of The Marvels is certainly its cast of characters, but the comedy comes in a close second. Teaming up to stop an intergalactic revenge plot doesn't sound like a ""funny"" story, but this story is full of funny situations from beginning to end.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

Oh yeah and Nick Fury (Samuel L Jackson) is here too. I still find it hard to believe we are where we are today with this cinematic universe.Let's start off with what I thought was alright. Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan is just a great casting choice. Like she carried her show, the heart of this movie is definitely her. She has wonderful comedic timing and a childish charm. I guess Carol and Monica's reunion were fine too, although not given enough focus and attention for it to stick. For a change, the post credit scene was fantastic in my opinion. It reignited my hype for what's to come. Other than that, I am afraid this film really didn't stand a chance.There is a scene here that absolutely baffled me where the movie just shifts into a musical. Yup, you read it right. The dialouge was just so over the top cringe and just didn't suit the characters at all. Nick Fury here is just in for comic relief, which is alright to do so but with the correct character. I see zero comparison with the Nick we saw in 'Secret Invasion' versus the Nick in this film. The villain here is forgettable, she has no compassion to her cause and is just plain boring.CGI here was standard. Not the worst I have seen and not really impressive. I find recent MCU films have these bland visuals that don't carry the name and spectacle that is the MCU.Not my favorite, not even close. Going forward, I hope we will see films or TV shows that do justice by these beloved characters.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

#overpowered

There's minimal chemistry among the three leads. The allegedly serious/sentimental moments are mawkish and cringe-worthy. The acting is generally subpar, including that from Brie Larson, an excellent actress except when she puts on her superhero cape. (The lone exception to this is Iman Vellani, who brings a puppy-dog sincerity to her performance.) The fight scenes and special effects-laden sequences are so badly choreographed and edited that it can be difficult to figure out what's going on. And if you want excitement, look elsewhere.In the past couple of years, the MCU has been spinning its wheels with each new entry (excepting Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3) as creative failure after creative failure has intensified the tailspin. Sadly, The Marvels is the worst of these offenders, elevating the third Ant-Man movie to masterpiece level by comparison. Instead of offering engaging storytelling, it give us flashes, bangs, bad dialogue, and a mountain of fakery (a reminder that things that work in comic books don't always translate to the silver screen). It's sound and fury signifying nothing except to expose another chink in the once-impervious armor of the MCU.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

They're never anything special, but they're rarely terrible.The Marvels, unfortunately, is truly awful. I don't think we can lay much blame at the feet of the director or stars as the problems are so fundamental to the project itself as to probably make a good version of this impossible.As an example, in a previous MCU film, Captain Marvel (played by Brie Larson) flies through and destroys a giant enemy spaceship. Here, for ""plot reasons"", she just stands back and watches enemy spaceships (that seem smaller by comparison) do their thing.That gets at the truly fundamental problem with this movie: nothing makes sense except as an excuse to have the plot be a paint-by-numbers MCU film.There's tension between Captain Marvel and Monica Rambeau because someone at the studio thought it would make things more interesting-but good lord, why? It's about Marvel leaving when Rambeau was a child something like thirty years ago. Who cares? What kind of person holds a grudge from when they were twelve?There's about a thousand opportunities and ways they could've defeated the villain well before the ending. Why didn't they? Or why didn't the creators at least come up with something to better explain their impotence?A poorly-conceived animated sequence that goes on way too long. Marvel-style humor that got old about thirty movies ago. People constantly making stupid decisions. Costumes and sets that look straight out of an '80s B-movie. A subplot about the alien cat species that... well, honestly, that part's better than everything else, so maybe I should cut it some slack.This film isn't the failure of the first MCU black director or an all-female lead cast. This film is the failure of Marvel to do anything other than build itself toward more future projects and ignore any kind of storytelling prowess that the people it hires might have. Marvel has backed itself into a corner of milquetoast nothingness, and now it can't even manage to do that right.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Well movie finally came out on digital and I gave it a shot. Wow, what a waste of time.1. The chemistry between the three main starts (Monica, Cap Marvel and Ms Marvel) isn't very good. It feels really forced and cheesy. Even with Monica and Cap Marvels connection in the MCU, you didn't really feel the chemistry with Monica as an adult.2. So many scenes were pain to watch as they felt very cheesy or just so dumb that it crossed a line. I nearly stopped when they come across a species of people who don't talk, but sing to communicate. It was like watching a never ending musical. So corny that I nearly turned off the movie.3. The villian was just so boring that you honestly didn't care. They weren't scary, their acting was awful and you found yourself falling asleep when they were on the screen.This movie honestly felt like a made for tv movie, but for maybe preteens or kids. It was cringe and cheesy so often that I lost interest and began looking away from the screen out of bordem. They didn't really fill in much for the characters predicament aside from ""OH, you all have the same sort of powers so thus this is why said stuff is happening"" Like seriously? Thats it?It's ashame because I enjoyed Captain Marvel (the movie) and I loved Monicas growth from that movie and Wanda Vision. As for Ms Marvel, obviously she is meant to target teen girls more then anyone else. But she is kind of a uninteresting character with kind of lame powers. And her acting wasn't exactly great.Perhaps the only good thing that came out of this movie was the Flurken (alien cat) scene near the end that I won't ruin. It was kinda cute. And of course the mid credit scene was amazing.So would I say to watch this movie? Not really. If you are like me and watch every MCU project to keep up with the story overall, I'd say go look at a synopsis of this movie and save yourself the time. Even at 1 hour and 40+ minutes long, it felt like it wouldn't end. I was already dead inside about 20 minutes in.With the exception of Loki Season 2, MCU just continues to spiral down hill. I felt he only hope at even saving it is the X-Men and Fantastic Four being introduced at some point. VERY painful to sit through, who made this?","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I gave it an 8/10 because it was different and 90s-based. The Marvels was more of the lackluster streak MCU has been on, sadly. I did not care for the two sidekicks, Monica and Kamala, because they acted like children and Captain Marvel was babysitting them. The Kree and Hala people were just there. Nick Fury is a shell of the his original character years ago. Captain Marvel lost her guts and is now bleh and somehow with little motivation to kick butt.The story was non-existent, much like the recent Marvel movies. I did not understand what the heck was the plot.

The Marvels speeds by with action after action and has a pretty straight forward plot. The chemistry between the 3 Leads here are great.

I'm not sure if it was the direction, script or acting, but the character didn't quite work for me. That said, James Spader's Ultron had the same effect on first viewing, but improved on subsequent views.Better than recent Marvel efforts (Quantumania and Love and Thunder) and I'm not saying they were terrible; I quite enjoyed them but, on a scale, The Marvels is better.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

The movie doesn't take itself too seriously which is a relief and the ms marvel character did not annoy me like I thought she would and was instead actually a pretty great addition. I liked a few of the stylistic choices throughout the film and also liked that they kept the tone fairly light, but when they did try to get deeper into stuff, the scenes just don't work and was unintentionally funny. A lot of the editing felt really clunky but there was a pretty fun montage sequence in the middle. The action throughout was also fairly decent.Nowhere near marvels worst.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

The three characters' genuine friendship makes for a lively and engaging encounter.The Marvels expands on Captain Marvel's predecessor by delving deeper into themes of sisterhood and interplanetary reliance. Written by DaCosta, Karasik, and McDonnell, the movie delves into the intricate geopolitical and familial underpinnings of Captain Marvel, striving to transcend existentialism.The plot of The Marvels has some sudden endings and dropped connections, making it rather perplexing. The narrative starts in Jersey City with a missing bangle discovered by a Kree named Dar-Benn. Wearing it, Kamala, the young protagonist of Ms. Marvel, works on her fan writing about Captain Marvel.DaCosta's choreography and visual aesthetic are highlighted in The Marvels through a storyline centered on the acquisition of Dar-Benn, Kamala's connection with Carol and Monica, and their use of their powers. A vérité technique reminiscent of Candyman and angular shifts are used to create the intimate mood of the picture.Joined by destiny, Carol, Monica, and Kamala have to stop Dar-Benn's scheme from happening to the cosmos. When it comes to their task, the stakes are not as high as they may be. The length of time it takes to learn Dar-Benn's motivations and the way that plot point is dropped in favor of a neat resolution are two issues with The Marvels.The bond between Captain Marvel, Carol, and Kamala is depicted in The Marvels. With Goose and Fury, Captain Marvel leads a solitary existence, as Carol works to piece together her past. Carol falls toward weakness and loses her steeliness as their interconnecting talents require regular engagement.Khan shows herself to be the key to this dynamic trio's success as the three ladies battle to save their galaxy. She encourages Carol to loosen up and assists Monica in brainstorming. She is unquestionably fierce, and if Disney and Marvel are astute, she will lead the franchise into the future.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Well paced and a lot of surprises. They better do more Captain Marvel and soon. The growth of all the characters worked well here. I enjoyed that the audio was actually at a good level and you could hear what was being said. The movie was the right length to tell the story they wanted to tell. I would have liked to see more interaction between those three but they had to tell a lot without lecturing or using a lot of flashbacks. I did catch something that no on else has or is talking about. There was one other thing that needed answering that wasn't covered that isn't a plot hole just something that needed to be covered.","9 out of 24 found this helpful.

In saying that, I feel the last few Marvel movies haven't been up to par so was a little hesitant to watch The Marvels to avoid disappointment. But I was pleasantly surprised though how good this movie was!I Highly recommend watching The Marvels. It's funny, cleaver and the action scenes are incredible. It's definitely better than the first movie.Brie Larson is amazing as usual, Teyonah Parris is a bad ass and Iman Vellani is so damn funny.Please put your biased opinions aside and watch this movie!

The film is a sequel to Captain Marvel and a continuation of the TV shows WandaVision and Ms. Marvel, but it also stands on its own as a captivating and original story.The film follows Carol Danvers, Monica Rambeau, and Kamala Khan as they discover that their powers are mysteriously linked and they start swapping places with each other every time they use them. This leads them to uncover a plot by the Kree, who are waging a civil war on their home planet and seeking to exploit the Quantum Bands, a powerful artifact that Kamala possesses.....The film is directed by Nia DaCosta, who creates stunning visuals and dynamic action sequences that keep the audience on the edge of their seats. She also balances the humor and drama of the film, giving each character a distinct personality and voice. The film also features a diverse and talented cast, led by Brie Larson as Carol Danvers, Teyonah Parris as Monica Rambeau, and Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan (from that great Disney plus series!). They have great chemistry, and they portray their characters with depth and nuance.The Marvels is a must-see film for Marvel fans and anyone who loves a good adventure. It is a celebration of female empowerment and a testament to the power of teamwork. It is one of the best films of 2023 and a worthy addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I give it a 09 out of 10 and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have an actual FUN time at the movies (remember fun?!)","11 out of 32 found this helpful.

Then I remembered the terrible reviews given to Captain Marvel and Ms. Marvel, and figured it was worth giving it a shot -- especially since it appeared to mean more Goose.I'm very glad I did.It felt like a movie about superheroes-as-people, dealing with the consequences of their actions, rather than crossover gimmicks like Avengers: Infinity War, which I literally walked out of three times, due to the sheer amount of stupid on display, from characters and from writers.This movie finds the humor when it fits, the pathos when it fits, and the fight scenes -- which could easily have been a complete nightmare, given the character-switching -- actually made sense, even when at their most complicated.Was it brilliantly acted? Not really, though Iman Vellani did very well -- but there have only been a few brilliant acting performances in the MCU as a whole, and they overwhelmingly involved two actors, now both out of the MCU, so...I would recommend it, unless your demands of a superhero movie involve being mostly fights and a hero who's male.","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

Kamala definitely represents the marvel fans, and her not only meeting her hero but joining her is likely a wish of a lot of marvel super fans. We also find out a little more backstory on Monica and Carol's relationship and why Monica seemed not too supportive of her in Wandavision. Captain Marvel is given more opportunity to show her more human self as opposed to the constant super hero which is great. Also the Flerken is definitely a favorite, who can't refuse a cute little fur all that could devour you whole!","13 out of 40 found this helpful.

Otherwise she was fantastic and they were great working together. I'll be interested to see what Kamala gets up to in the future and whether we will be seeing much of Captain Marvel after this.

I rewatched Ms Marvel in preparation and loved it and really enjoyed seeing Kamala Khan interact with the others (Iman Vellani is brilliant, so are the others). I think you can still see this and enjoy it without having seen Ms Marvel, or WandaVision.This was its own story but had a couple of brief but fun cameos linking it to the wider MCU.I enjoyed the humour and the action, it was great to see Kamala's family, but my favourite part was the interaction between the 3 leads and their dynamic. It also touched on the fact that even though some people idolise Captain Marvel, she's not perfect.Another thing I want to highlight is one of the planets they go to - it really feels like the culture is unique and well thought-out (along with their unique language style). Often films where they go to different planets, the planet feels just like earth but the people have purple skin or something, whereas this really felt like a different culture.My main criticism is that a couple of bits near the end weren't explained fully leaving me slightly confused, and also that I would have liked the film to be longer and to see more of the characters. But apart from that I really enjoyed it!Oh, and the mid-credits scene made me feel very excited for what's to come next!","11 out of 33 found this helpful.

Lighthearted and enjoyable like my favorite MCU movies, I felt that it had excellent pacing, action, and even the acting was above par for a comic book movie. Seeing it in the theater, I felt the same as when I saw Guardians of the Galaxy and Ant-Man, back when the MCU was new(-ish): the feeling that this was exactly what comic book movies should be, and that someone finally found all the fun that lesser movies had chosen not to include.I've been burnt out on the MCU but went to see this anyway, and I'm glad I did. It has a consistently fun atmosphere and many jokes that are impeccably written and delivered. The premise is silly, the science fiction is hand-waved away, and the characters are dropped into unusual situations to act like themselves for better or worse - all exactly as a comic book movie should be, in my opinion.Punctuating the movie's jovial tone, there are a few scenes that highlight the emotional connections between the characters and themes involving knowing who we are, balancing our personal and familial responsibilities, and letting others see our true selves even when we're not at our best... and none of them were long enough to derail the fun I was having.Like Guardians, Thor: Ragnarok, and the Spider-Verse, this is exactly what I want a comic book movie to be.","32 out of 119 found this helpful.

Development and deep Character exploration is light to non-existent. This is not your ""Thinking Man's"" movie. (and clearly not a ""Man's"" movie at all, but still great for guys!) So if you want to think, and explore deep character motivations, the other reviews are right.. wait for streaming. If you want a fun, engaging movie, I rate this one better than the ending 90 minutes of Barbie (the first few minutes of Barbie were so good.. ..then.. plop)The only thing on the downside for me is the kind of emotionless style of Brie Larson, but she does play the super-est hero in a similar way other actors have portrayed Superman... stoic, a little wooden, but super powerful. I wish we could see her having as much fun as Iman Vellani! Her few moments of warmth and emotion were great to see.Speaking of Iman Vellani, I think compared to the Infinity War Spiderman, she has a way to go, but her performance is still fun to watch, and always seems sincere and real.We saw the movie with the teen girls, and they all thought it was awesome. If you want to be engaged and entertained for 90 minutes, this is probably the best option available over the last few months!","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

The action starts this movie out strong then you start to understand the characters very quickly, given you haven't seen any material leading up to this film. There is just enough comedic relief to break up the fight sequences and the comedy is lighthearted and not over the top. Sure the CGI could have used a little more effort when it comes to Flurken stuff but the fighting is fantastic and well practiced. The villain of the film is wonderful, a character that is misunderstood-classic villain material. All 3 leads of the movie had great energy and on screen chemistry. It felt like they were real people. Brie Larson has gotten slack in the past for her portrayal of Captain Marvel and she is here in this movie to prove everybody wrong and to tell the world that she was made for this role. This movie has a short run time but it gets to the point and doesn't draw out scenes, it doesn't feel rushed at all. Overall a great movie for all ages and is very inclusive.","11 out of 34 found this helpful.

Strikes, unknown director, superhero fatigue, and perhaps most notably is the MCUs track record lately which has been abysmal.But oh my lord this is so much fun watch.There are 3 negatives: I can think of is that it is too short. This movie flies by with stunning entertainment from first second to last, and the ""short"" run-time makes it fly by even faster. The second negative is that this feels a bit too goofy and too Marvel at times. The first Movie was much better, and felt more original, and more true to the character of Captain Marvel. The third negative is a few misses in the dialogue, but I also think that goes together with the short run time.The good with this movie is basically everything else. The directing (which I was very hesitant about) was good, the acting one of the best in any Marvel production, the music and sound design is masterful, and the entertainment goes through the roof into the stratosphere. Perhaps the most entertaining Marvel movie of all time. Not the best, the movie is more average Marvel-wise, but this is a very fun movie.From the movie theatre I was in, everyone came out with a big smile on their face. The only other time I have seen so many smiling faces leaving the movie theatre was after the first Deadpool.A very strong 8/10, I am almost inclined to give this a 9 but this is not as good as the first movie (which I really love) and there are a few misses that reduces the score. Still great fun and very entertaining. A most watch.","182 out of 837 found this helpful.

Is it the best Marvel film, no. Is it the worst marvel film, no. This is a great fun film and it has its own audience. As a marvel fan and a dad of a teenage daughter, this is the audience.As an MCU fan who can just enjoy the characters in their own contained story, i liked it. For my daughter who thought Marvel was for boys, to see an all girl group, she's been converted. She liked the banter, the action, and the Flirkins. I loved that she loved it. So for me this is an 8/10.It's not moving the MCU forward in some long story arc, the villain is good but not a level boss, and the threat never felt too real. But it was FUN. Remember that; when MCU was just fun and not bogged down with excessive expectation or to be part of some multiversal annhilation build up. This is popcorn.I've read some really hateful reviews and it feels unjustified. The movie had pace, good action, some great set peices, great designs, wardrobes, music. Each character has a bit of an arc, leaving the movie further forward than at the start. The movie dared to have a Cinderella musical moment and an invasion of cats. Love it for what it is, a fun light hearted chapter of the MCU.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Expectations were quickly exceeded. Captain Marvel, WandaVision, and Ms. Marvel were average that had their good moments. This movie was better than those shows. Plot was decent. Nothing revealing about the future movies, in particular Kang the Conquer. Had some good action sequences and unexpected humor with the 'cats'. I think Brie Larsen redeemed herself as an actress slightly with this movie. Slight spoiler here: Stay for the mid credit scene. It will be interesting to see how X-Men and Marvel collaborate together. It seems this is the direction we're heading with Deadpool 3 involving Hugh Jackman.

Don't let the runtime fool you, this movie is packed in a very good way. The cinematography in the opening sequences particularly stands out as a technical highlight as well as the new Marvels score. Iman Vellani shines in her stand-out role and it is apparent she is having the time of her life, particularly in the final scene of the film. The film's pacing is inconsistent at times but only pulls you out of the moment for a few moments. The villain is sadly underdeveloped and I wish there was more motivation fleshed out but that is made up by the leads' wonderful chemistry and dynamic together. No doubt about it, this movie had me leaving the theater wanting more from these three characters together. I believe it makes a fine entry as the 33rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and gives you some phase 1 level, all-time Marvel scenes hinting at the future of the MCU. While keeping these scenes from overshadowing the movie as a whole. It's a story that is part of a larger universe, and nothing felt like the scene was at the expense of the story of this movie. This film is an absolute Marvel, see it in theaters.","27 out of 102 found this helpful.

Black Widow
Doctor Strange and the multiverse of madness
Eternals!!!!!?????The movie wasn't great just a stepping stone for the introduction of Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau.The story was generic and not very interesting but it was entertaining and funny.I love Iman Vellani she is very funny and silly a breath of fresh air for the Marvel universe with stuck up actors who aren't funny at all (Ruffalo I'm talking to you)I think a fair evaluation would be 6.5 to 7 at least. Also what are you expecting in a Marvel movie if it's not silly jokes and a ok plot just to hang out at the cinema.Get real people is a Marvel movie, lighten up or start to change your scores for all of the marvel movies.

I enjoyed it. And IMO it developed Carol Danvers' character significantly. The writing for both Monica Rambeau and Kamala Khan felt... compressed, and their origins seemed a bit ""glossed over"".While I am glad this wasn't a three hour movie - there is only so much you can pack into a 1 hour, 45 minute movie. It could have been a little longer if just to give these two characters a little more time to talk with each other about their early experiences. And maybe a little less time spent in the ""training montage"" sequence with the flashy CGI effects.I loved how Iman Vellani (playing Kamala Khan) pulled off the ""I talk way too much while fangirling"" character. It seemed quite believably acted and not forced.IMO it's at least as good as Black Widow was, and will likely be more entertaining for many.I give it a solid 8 out of 10 for the MCU movies.","8 out of 23 found this helpful.

Each of the three protagonists looked like they had fun playing their roles. Brie Larson gave a great performance now that she's settled in playing Carol and for those of who weren't too keen on the character from the first film may find her a lot better in this sequel (quick side note, I've been a Brie Larson Stan since the trolls tried to destroy the film and make up fake news about her).It was great seeing Teyonah Parris back as a superpowered Monica Rambeau and she had great comedic timing. However the standout performance was Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan a.k.a Ms Marvel. When she finally meets her hero and idolises her, it reminds me the way Tom Holland's Peter Parker admirers and looks up to Tony Stark.The fight choreography was cleverly done such as one scene where it took a place in the Khan household and how the character's must learn to switch places in order to work together to defeat the villain Dar-Benn.My only few criticisms I have for the film is that it was one of the Marvel movies that had a short runtime and because I was having fun watching it, I didn't want it to end and it went by so quickly. Another critique is the villain was a bit bland. Zawe Ashton gave it her all, but she's one of the weakest baddies in the franchise. Her motivations were explained but felt rushed. Also seeing baby kitten flerkens were so cute!!Overall, the movie is fun, action packed and in my opinion, just the film we need in all the superhero fatigue that is being talked about. I would rank it up in my top 20. Plus stay for the post credit scene! I was screaming in the theatre, lol😂 Can't wait to see the film again.Higher Further Faster!!!","11 out of 35 found this helpful.

The villain was great. Maybe people didn't like how cute she was?All the story, characters, and fight scenes seemed polished to a T. If anything it was a tad too short. They pretty much had to make everything to a T because there isn't much down time or time to take things in. Its packed with action to the point the characterization had to happen fast when they really could have taken a little more time in areas so people who hadn't watched all the other material didn't feel lost. This is especially noticeable with the prince whoes world has never been seen in the Marvel movies before.","25 out of 95 found this helpful.

Is it perfect? No.There are some weak points, like Aladna. I feel they could've opted for a better execution of the ""language"" so it didn't seem so bad cringe instead of the intended funny awkward cringe. (But it by no means is significant enough that it ruins the movie, just more of a ""They could've done it better."") I'm not gonna elaborate because it would spoil the language surprise aspect for viewers, but if you watch it I think you'll understand why I said it could've been done better.I will say I did not enjoy the villain's acting. The villain didn't emote in a way that felt authentic so it didn't evoke the empathy that they could have received given the validity of their reason. The best villains are the ones with valid reasons, and this villain definitely had a valid reason to do bad things, so they by all means should have been a good villain. But the performance didn't make me feel empathy for the villain and if you knew me, you'd know I empathize easily and cry easy during movies. There definitely were other situations/characters in the movie that invoked emotion. But the villain was not one of them. I don't fully know if it was just bad acting, intentional, or the make-up/contacts made them feel unauthentic/uncanny but it did impact my enjoyment of the movie.So now that we covered the weak points, let's talk about the strong points: The leads were great, Captain Marvel, Captain Monica Rambeau, and Ms. Marvel. Their interactions were great, the acting, fighting, action, teamwork and everything was really well done. The soundtrack was good, the action sequences were good, the plot was also good and there were some really fun/silly scenes that left a lasting impression in the movie. I really enjoyed those aspects enough to make up for the lackluster villain performance. Most of the other actors also did an amazing job too. All in all I would say it's a good time.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

We finally get the three females as a group together - of course Captain Marvel had her standalone movie already. But the other two are new to the cinema screen. We got to see them (evolve) on the small screen. And I reckon Kamala Harris is the one that is able to shine brightest in this.I understand that some people are still feeling the highs of the Avengers movies (Infinity War and Endgame) and it is true that the new movies since then feel a bit disconnected ... or at least not as connected as the old ones. You have to suspend your disbelief and just enjoy what they try to do here.I could point out that everyone seems to be speaking English, no matter where or when they are from (I reckon no matter the planet, universe or reality) ... or that they use days and hours as a system we as viewers can relate to. But in space that would not make sense. The movie is pointing out the up and down in space - or rather it is made fun of. But even that is only touched slightly ... then you have make up and hair in space ... not sure what the vastness of space would do to ones hair ... even to an individual that is as powerful as ... Thanos (or close to).Though with so much power ... would she even need the help of anyone else? Again, you can nitpick a lot ... you can question a lot ... or you can just sit back, put your feet up high (if possible) and just enjoy the show. Apparently this was way darker in its first iteration ... but got extensive reshoots ... I have not read a lot about the original version ... but there may have been a connection to Loki that does not really exist now.That said, I thought the effects were fine, the jokes were at least good (some were even great, again looking at you Miss Marvel and family) ... and Nick Fury adding some needed foundation and grounding ... and solutions when needed.There is darkness, there is a lot of loss of life or at least destruction ... but there is also light ... and there is another added bonus scene mid credit. After credits scene? None, just some audio that I reckon is a funny touch ... but maybe not worth the wait in the cinemas if you watch it there ... if you are fast forwarding at home ... you probably will miss it - due to you looking out for a visual scene - and there is none.The story continues ... and there is a lot to be discovered - this is light entertainment - nothing more, nothing less. Story moves straight forward ... and I liked it ...quirky humor and even the ""Bollywood"" inspired set piece and scene did work ... mostly.","13 out of 44 found this helpful.

They carried the same great family energy from the Ms Marvel show over to the comically entagled joyride that is The Marvels. Getting to see the reunion of ""Loitenant Trouble"" and her Aunt Carol was emotional and well earned. The dynamic between the main trio was serious at times, but fun and whimsical when it needed to be. This is a very quick paced movie which was nice, it didn't bore you or drag out sequences.

Iman Vellani steals the show and had us laughing and smiling through most of the movie. Teyonnah Paris brings the Monica you know from WandaVision completely back finally giving us some answers as to what happened between her and Carol. And let's talk about Brie Larson. It's no secret Brie can act but she's never really gotten much to do within the MCU. This movie finally lets Brie show her full range of emotions as we see her filled with sorrow to absolute joy.Despite how powerful these women are they came up with a way to make the challenge actually feel like something they had to overcome. This isn't an easy victory for them. There's a great training montage during the film that sees them work on their skills but even after that they aren't yet ready to win. And if they actually win in this movie at all is debatable.The villain is fairly forgettable like many Marvel villains. It felt like this was written to feature Ronan originally but then they remembered he was dead. Or possibly they planned to use another Kree we knew from the first movie. However, despite their forgetableness they truly were a force to be reckoned with clear motivations. They were prepared to accept their fate in the end because they believed in their cause so much.There were some very great moments throughout and some side characters like Kamala's family and a flerken (or more) really made some of the scenes all the more fun.If you like your movies to give you a smile this one is for you.","23 out of 89 found this helpful.

There are many things to criticize the MCU for, and this film is certainly not exempt from them, however, it has a sense of humor about it that is perfectly balanced with its plot. It's not a boring waste of time like the last Ant-Man movie, nor is it two separate movies placed together like the last Thor movie. It's quite enjoyable. It does have a few problems, as I previously mentioned. The first problem is the MCU is a victim of its own success. Kamala Khan is an interesting character, and seeing her family try to deal with a ridiculous situation is quite entertaining, but there are a lot of Marvel fans who just watch the movies. And if you just watch the movie, Kamala just seems like an extra character added ridiculously to this Captain Marvel sequel. But it makes a lot of sense, Kamala is obsessed with Captain Marvel, takes her name after Captain Marvel, so she's Miss Marvel which means she is someone who looks up to Carol Danvers as did her niece when she was little. The other problem, is the Superman problem. Captain Marvel is MCU's equivalent of superman. And like Superman, it is incredibly hard to create a compelling narrative about someone whose powers are so overwhelming. So in this film, the question that's asked is what happens if you have the powers of a god, and you make mistakes? That plot is interesting, but it's a little overshadowed by the wackiness of the rest of the film, which like I said is quite enjoyable. So if you're on the fence about watching this film, give it a chance.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

I really don't know what these people who are giving this movie a low rating want. It is a Marvel movie not a contender for the Oscar movie of the year category. This movie delivered what it was supposed to. Action and laughs. The dynamics of there enter connected relationships was fun to watch a bit shallow but AGAIN it a Marval movie people. I feel like most of these people went to hate watch. You know what they say you only find what your looking for.

People were leaving due to the cold but my wife, three children, girls aged 13, 9 and 7 and I braved the cold to watch the film.I've seen the vitriol thrown at the film but I have to say, I was never less than entertained and at points laughed out loud. My children and wife loved every minute. What a change from the usual role models they're exposed to.We've kept up with all the Marvel series and films on Disney + but I can see that it would be confusing for those who haven't. I'd also quite like to watch it again as there were some glaring continuity errors that may have just been that I'd missed a bit.It's not serious and very lighthearted. But it was everything we needed for a brief (less than 2 hour) film. And my children didn't ask to leave to go to the bathroom once.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

I don't think I've ever seen some with such compelling choreography. That is in great part due to the pitch of the movie, the switching places, and they exploited it to the maximum for these scenes and it was a delight to watch. They had a real rhythm and I was very much into them.The movie also had for itself simple, unbridled fun. It did not take itself deathly seriously, and accepted to be an experience that brought the audience in for what felt like sharing a nice time with it. Still, I felt great fondness for the characters and the bond they showed from the start then developped, was charmed again by the Khans' family dynamic, and of course, felt fear and sadness at some points as well. Not heart-breaking, earth-shattering fear and sadness, but nevertheless compelling and enjoyable.This was a thoroughly enjoyable experience and I'm looking forward to seeing more of the characters. One of the most unabashedly fun MCu movies in a while, reminding us that sometimes it's not about the stakes but about going back to the basics of what superheroes are. People like us, who try their very best, and who make us live adventures with them.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

That's quite a bit of pre-reading, is it not?!I'd seen all the stuff leading up to Endgame and then the Wandavision series ... I think. Quantumania I also saw, along with Black Widow. This big screen effort was just as entertaining as those two, thought I.At worst there are far too many ""in-joke"" moments that fall flat for the uninitiated. At best, it is different having three lasses as your protagonists in a superhero movie. Each performer is committed to their respective roles, and the Big Bad does their absolute utmost with what material they had.Danvers' main plot point is given an afterthought's treatment, although Larson makes even this go a long way. It's a sacrifice made for having 3 main characters - each only gets 1/3 of the run-time's worth of attention.Look, it's a fun movie. I had no problem with it.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

There could have easily been an extra scene or 2 to allow the characters to breathe and avoid too much exposition, but it's fine without them.It's fun and silly, like a comic, but not to the excess of Love & Thunder.If you're on the fence about seeing this ignore the hate. Yes the 3 main characters are women. Yes the main villain is a woman. But really, that should not matter one bit.

The zippy 1h45 runtime was perfect, no boring long moments where nothing happens, it's literally action from the get go! The effect were great, I didn't have any problems with them at all! The three leads were also great and bounced off each other perfectly, the body swapping action scenes were well choreographed also. And above all it was just a fun time, which I think has been sorely missed in films recently!!

What did everyone expect exactly? And since when did everyone become such an expert?This movie is absolutely a perfectly fine MCU instalment. It is not as good as any of the Avengers team movies but much better than say Iron Man 1-2 or Captain America the First Avenger etc. The story was for me compelling, especially since I am not a huge fan of all the time travel stuff. It was a story of friendship, redemption and recognizing your mistakes. The action scenes were great, the CGI was great and the acting was great. Brie Larson is doing absolutely a fantastic job as Captain Marvel again, and the trio just works fine. I actually really liked the villain story. Not one of those heavy but also often senseless ones in the comics but a villain out of need. So all in all, I really enjoyed this movie, I will gladly see it again.

The initial reviews were not promising. In my head, it felt like the MCU was falling into DC territory. For context, I'll say this - I'm a 50 something father who's followed the MCU with my 20 something son from the outset. Am I hard-core? No, but my son is. We watched every Disney+ Marvel series and I try to see the movies in the theatres if I can.With all that, I found The Marvels to be extremely satisfying. Period. The issues between Carol and Monica were explained and resolved without a long drawn out affair. Kamala added a lot to the cast being a Fangirl of Captain Marvel and her character was beautifully portrayed by Iman Vellani. I will say this - having watched Ms Marvel on Disney+ did help a great deal because the family was added to the cast for the movie. For me, this add was a bonus.Now, are there things to criticize with this movie? For me, no. But again, I have all of the knowledge that is needed to get the full extent of what the story is laying out. If you don't have this, there's things you can nitpick about, most definitely. When I look at it from that vantage point, it does concern me, though. As Phase 1 rolled out, with every film I would be cautious and tell my son to not get his hopes up too high, but by the time Avengers came out, I was amazed. They had executed something I had never seen before. And with the closing credits for End Game, I knew I had been witness to something that was never done before and it would be extremely difficult to follow up. Is it impossible? Only time will tell.So... here we are. The Marvels is the 3rd movie in Phase 5 - PHASE 5 PEOPLE!!! There's so much I could say here but the reality is this. If you're going to go to one of these movies now with no background knowledge of what the MCU is, it's gonna be challenging. This is unfortunate for us - the movie goers, because if the performance at the box office stumbles, this will affect how Disney will go forward with things. I know it's easy to look at most of these films now and be hyper critical. But considering there's been 30+ movies now, with a continuity that I suspect most in the industry envy, it would be nice to see a more measured tone in these reviews. I can honestly say I thoroughly enjoyed The Marvels. I will probably go back to see it again in the theatres if I can.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

As Marvel fans we've had a rough phase. Love and Thunder was a mess, and Quantum-whatsit completely forgot what works about Ant-Man. (Seriously, as soon as Luis isn't in the movie there's a problem in AntLand.)But, listen. Think back to early MCU. Remember how fun it was? Remember how you didn't have to watch 30 films to know what was going on? Wasn't it nice?The Marvels is a return to that joyful, less entangled time. Honestly, you could get away with only seeing Captain Marvel before watching this...though why you'd deny yourself the joy of Ms. Marvel I do not know. I cannot express how nice it is to just be able to enjoy a Marvel film.In this trim film, Carol Danvers is back, but this time she's not alone. The additions of Monica Rambeau and Kamala Khan help prevent Captain Marvel from falling into being a one-dimensional character. We are reminded that, super-powered though she may be, Carol is still human. She makes mistakes, she gets scared, and she has to remember that she doesn't have to go it alone.And honestly, Teyonah Parris and Iman Vellani are wonderful additions to the MCU. Teyonah is soulful, thoughtful, and nuanced in her performance. Iman is all heart, bringing that same joy and exuberance that I think we all felt as Marvel fans when the MCU began. Park Seojoon was also a delight, but we barely scratched the surface on what he can do. Dear Kevin, please give us more Prince Yan and his stunning kingdom.If you are expecting a serious epic, you will be disappointed. This movie is not Endgame or Wakanda Forever. Instead, this is a joyful, comedic romp. It embraces the absurdity of space cats and super-powered teenagers with verve. And I couldn't stop laughing; it was just fun.Also, I loved the way Nia directed the film. The women are strong and beautiful, but they're not there to be objects. The fight scenes were dynamic and engaging. And some of the comedic choices were absolutely hilarious.If there was one thing the film needed it was more development of Zawe Ashton's Dar-Benn. There were threads of an incredibly interesting backstory, and Zawe is a very talented actress. But it almost feels like the movie needed another fifteen minutes to the runtime to help flesh out Dar-Benn more. And normally I'm the first person to say a film could be shorter.Overall, though, this movie is a great time.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

It has a fun and creative mechanic used throughout the film, the humour was great, albeit more subtle and natural which may not be for everyone, but I think it was done really well. Also, can't forget the leads of the movie who do a great job.The main 3 leads did a great job, had great chemistry with each other and were fun with lots of fun moments of the characters and the peculiar scenarios where the characters can play off each others different personalities.(I will also say, over the years the Internet has chastised Captain Marvel for ""not having personality"". Regardless of your thoughts on her in the first movie, you can tell that the director heard the backlash and she is now has a lot of personality and heart. Though, I still defend that Captain Marvel needed to be portrayed as Stoic for their first movie.)The villain of the movie, while sometimes treated like more of a plot point, still has a solid motivation. Though, I don't think the focus needed to be more on her, she has a presence in the film but she's not the main focus of it. She also much like the premise of this movie uses a fun and creative approach to something we have already seen to reuse it in a new and exciting way.All round just a fun watch, while also starting to tie in other parts of the MCU together which I feel like the Internet has been dying for.","12 out of 43 found this helpful.

A breath of fresh air after Guardians of the Galaxy 3 which was a very good film but the subject matter and length of the film did make it feel heavy at times. By contrast this film was very much on the short end.The humour was on point, the interaction between the main protagonists was excellent and Brie Larson certainly redeemed her more average performance from her Origin film.Plot moved along at a steady pace with a villain that you could understand their motivations even if you didn't agree with their methods to achieve their goals.As for the incredibly negative reviews, one can't help but suspect as is customary in this day and age for anything involving Marvel or Star Wars or basically any franchise at this stage, if the lead protagonists are all female/ethnicall diverse/LGBTQ that this has been targeted for negative reviews. For evidence look at essentially all films in the MCU where these characteristics are the lead and watch people try and justify their poor ratings with little to back it up.Overall, don't believe the people who can't wait to hate on any films that the MCU throw out that aren't headlined by white men and watch it with an open mind and you'll likely find you enjoy it. If you don't, there's always Samuel L Jackson to fall back on who is a treasure.","9 out of 30 found this helpful.

It was nice to see a more wittier side of Nick Fury. I think this movie have a little more character to captain Marvel which was well needed. Monica Rambeau really shined in here second MCU appearance as a superhero. The only flaw to me was the short ending & it seems the mcu is still not connecting the stories of late. But, My daughters love superhero movies
And it's nice to give the a chance to see women hero's take the lead!","10 out of 36 found this helpful.

If u like feel good movies and comedy, you'll like it. Gorgeous visuals and excellent chemistry from the cast. Iman Villani was amazing and a stand out. Nia decosta did an excellent job at directing. I wish it was longer, it was very fast paced. Once again, cast chemistry made up for it. Go see it this weekend! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. As I was leaving the theater, there was a kid that said they wanted to watch it all over again. That made me smile. I wish this movie got more press and marketing, but there was a strike going on. Anyways, definitely go see this movie! Have fun!","25 out of 112 found this helpful.

Sure, there are some issues with the film, primarily the very quick pacing. This film was aggressively edited, but I prefer a breezy film over a slog like The Eternals.What is great here are the strong, human, and fun characters: everybody in the cast feels vibrant, much more than in their previous appearance. ESPECIALLY Carol Danvers. I see other reviews saying she's just a plot device in this movie. This is true of her other MCU appearances, but here she has emotion, an arc, and actually utilizes Brie Larson's skills as an actorGive this film a chance and go have fun at an MCU movie again!","8 out of 28 found this helpful.

Captain Marvel, WandaVision and Ms. Marvel are wonderful movies/tv shows and should be watched regardless of this movie. But it's a heck of a lot easier to understand the plot if you've seen them first.The Marvels captivated me the way Marvel movies tend to do, but this one was different. The themes of family, coming of age, revenge, guilt and teamwork are fully brought to life. Marvel has always been more than just Hulk Smash. The stories resonate with me as I enjoy the human (or non human) interactions that continue across multiple movies and shows. The characters develop through interpersonal relationships as they grow and learn, which for us fanboys, means more of it as Marvel has this uncanny ability to inspire feelings of family and friendship for the fictional characters. The attention to detail is A+ and as you know, there will be moments that gasp in the theatre with surprise and happiness. I know I did.Stay for the mid credit scene. They always have one, of course. But this? Wow. I have been waiting over 30 years and it's finally happening.","28 out of 131 found this helpful.

It feels like we're connecting the dots in these time rips and though it may feel chaotic now, these small doses will feel more profound when the story comes full circle. That's what I hope! Good job!I also must say that the mom in this movie is so funny. Ms. Marvels family had us all laughing.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

I wasn't intending to watch this movie but on recommendation of my daughter realized that I should give it a shot. I admit that it had some interesting parts and it was quite comical - some of the lines from Samuel L Jackson 'Nick Fury' were the best parts of the movie.The action sequences and the lessons and morale that are evident through the story are engrossing and the characters each have both relatable good qualities and a few natural flaws that make them seem believable. The MCU ideals of incursions and universes overlapping starts to play out to tie in other attributes of the Marvel worlds and it was fun to see how they did that.No need for spoilers, obviously, but I will say as with all Marvel films make sure you stay until the end of the credits to see a bonus scene that gives interesting insight into what may or may not occur within the MCU next.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

I thought Morbius was Marvels last good movie and Marvels peak but this movie made me Morb around the theater one more time and it was great! When the movie was over the whole theater got up and started spinning because it was very spectacular. This movie may be my favorite movie but Morbius might still be better due to the choreography in its fights. When the Marvels ended milk shot out of my nose and stuff.This Movie is truly represents Marvels mission which is to make not great movies but fantastic movies for their fans. The story was immaculate but I do not want to really spoil anything because the story is incredible. I cannot understand why people are rating this movie bad because it was incredible and I just think people are jealous that they can't make a better movie than this. I booked a ticket for everyday of the week so I can watch this movie again. Kamala Harris (Ms. Marvel) was a really good character and had good chemistry with captain marvel. My only criticism is that the movie is not one minute longer because I feel like they rushed it by not giving us that extra minute of movie. The story was creative and only intelligent minds would be able to follow and understand which might be another reason why people are rating this movie bad.The villain was basically the next Morbius and is my second favorite villain of all time Morbius is just a little bit better.They need to higher Nia Dacosta as the official Marvel director because she did an incredible job and i'd like to see a sequel to this movie but with Morbius in it because that would give us even morb.Truly what a marvelous movie they have made. I am impressed.IT'S MORBIN TIME!!!","17 out of 73 found this helpful.

None of the multiverse stuff that we've been overwhelmed with lately. The straight forward story was refreshing, at least for me anyway. All three Marvels are incorporated into the movie nicely and we get the explanation for what happened at the end of the Ms. Marvel TV show. And the two end credit scenes are, well just wow. And one a nod to a wonderful scene from the first Iron Man. The people in my showing all clapped at the end.","7 out of 24 found this helpful.

Surprisingly, upcoming star Iman Vellani was the shining star of the film for me with her wit and comical delivery.

I was thrilled that her family from Ms Marvel were featured more prominently than just a cameo appearence: they're so hilarious and loveable. All the main characters bring their A-game and their funny and heartfelt interactions are worth the price of the movie ticket alone.The movie is not only fun but insanely creative as well.

Carol Danvers had a lot more charisma then she's shown so far, and Kamala was as lovable as she was in the show (even if overall the show was meh).Was it the best Marvel movie to date? Of course not. But it was a solid story that showed off it's main characters in a very good light and made me excited for Kamala's future in the MCU.And how can you hate the Moose (and company) sequence!? Maybe the water works sequence was cringe for some but I thought it was hilarious. The humor was well placed and didn't wear out it's welcome like in Love and Thunder.","6 out of 20 found this helpful.

I've seen criticism on that there's too much focus on funny stuff, on that there is a misconception on who's the target audience. It's not dark enough. Well, the target audience is family. It's family fun time. And it works. Nothing better than to sit in the cinema and sharing laughs and action with your kids. Marvel knows it and does everything right with The Marvels. Me and my 12 year old had an absolute blast. He has seen a lot and this is one of his top 3 favorites instantly. Sure, it's no 'Guardians' but does it have to be? Any negative reviewer would have probably loved it in their teens. They just grew up and became too old for it. Find your inner kid and enjoy this movie for what it is.","6 out of 20 found this helpful.

I would say it you are a fan of marvel and of creative plots then this is the movie for you. I also love the ending and how it's not over till it's over.

Sensed a touch of Disney-ness and, sorry, laughed my head off, especially at Carol's deadpan handling of those princess-ey moments. The franchise needed a new direction, something different (yet the same) and new doors open! That's what I've been crying for! And that's what I got! Why should I complain? No. I have no reason to complain. After the mega epic Endgame, like many, I too still wondered, where next... I see it now, this time, as I left the cinema.

Well. It's all Carol Danvers' fault, after she destroyed rhe Supreme Intelligence, the Kree have a civil war which ecologically wrecks their home planet Hala and damages their sun (we learn this at the start). Dar-Benn, the new leader of the Kree, retrieves one of the Quantum Bands, of which Kamala Khan (Ms Marvel) has the other half. Dar-Benn harnesses the power of the Band to tear open a jump point in space. This causes damage The resulting anomaly is investigated by from separate sides by Monica Rambeau and Carol Danvers. When Rambeau touches the anomaly, she, Danvers, and Kamala switch places through teleportation. The switching causes the three to fight each others' Kree enemies. This results in some slapstick comedy scenes which also advance the narrative. How will they sort this out? Nick Fury is involved as well, so is the lovable cat who sprouts tentacles from his mouth and swallows the Kree leader's henchmen and many kittens appear.. The Skrull once again have to be rescued by the trio and Danvers learns lessons about her Great White Saviour Complex. We even get a planet where the inhabitants communicate through song, colourfully dressed like aliens from STOS or early episodes of STNG. Some great battle scenes and one to combat, all delivers with a soupcon of humour. Not the greatest of the Marvel films (this is the 33rd film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)). But well worth watching. Directed by Nia DaCosta, who co-wrote the screenplay with Megan McDonnell and Elissa Karasik. 7.5/10.","8 out of 30 found this helpful.

I think the Captain Marvel series gets unfair criticism because it's telling the story from a woman's perspective and geared towards the MCU's female fan base. This movie is no exception. IMO, Marvel has historically done an awful job with the multiverse concept. In past films, it failed to build on the logic from the ""What if...?"" series by focusing less on a coherent storyline and more on trying to top itself. This movie however did well by going with a simpler and more entertaining storyline. It humorously uses some of the self-effacng sarcasm that was in Iron Man. It also did a good job showing the way the super heros resolve conflict while utilizing their unique powers without stepping on each other's toes. Unlike other MCU multiverse-oriented movies, I'm looking forward to the next one in this series.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Samuel L. Jackson is back with a fury as Nick Fury and bringing the much-needed energy and comic relief as usual.I highly encourage watching the following Marvel movies and TV series in order to thoroughly prepare for The Marvels:The Marvels' storyline picks up right after each of the main stars' respective storylines and manages to combine their story arc into a unique and marvelous manner, keeping it consistent with some of the current events within the broad Marvel Cinematic Universe and developing our heroes from individual stars into a team of superstars. The costumes are aesthetically pleasing.Zawe Ashton plays the part of Dar-Benn, the antagonist in The Marvels. I would have loved to see more of her character's backstory and hope that we get to see more backgrounds being unpacked either through Marvel TV Series or even an television special.The movie's runtime is 105 minutes, making it the shortest Marvel movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story felt a little bit rushed, considering a dangerous mission is underway to prevent world-level ramifications but no-time is wasted to deliver yet another masterpiece in the cinematic universe.The story delivers a few unique twists, lots of humor and a few surprises. The movie definitely contains something for everyone, young and old, and I encourage you to take the whole family to experience The Marvels.The Marvels is a story that keeps the golden thread, which is the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and still manages to peak higher, further and faster into the multiversal trajectory.The trailer doesn't spoil much, but as always, a secret awaits for those who eagerly pay attention to the Marvel's trailers. My only worry is that usually key spoilers tend to emerge in the week following the release of the movie in the forms of updated sneak peaks and mini-trailers.There is a mid-credits scene that you don't want to miss, but no post-credits scene.I rate this movie 8 out of 10.

We loved the laughs, the action, the ladies coming together and fighting together, the connection between Ms Marvel, WandaVision, and Captain Marvel, and everything in between. It wasn't Guardians of the Galaxy 3 or even as complex as Loki, but it certainly wasn't the worst, and I'd say that's a bit dramatic to say so. It definitely gave a light, fun, and humorous take on MCU content that maybe the latest movies were too serious to do so. I think this movie was like an introduction to The Marvels and did an amazing job doing just that. Great job ladies on this movie, and I'd definitely watch it again.","9 out of 37 found this helpful.

It has unexpected twists and turns around every corner that help make it an entertaining movie.The Marvels centers around members of the Avengers. Carol Danvers (Brie Larson), better known as Captain Marvel, has found herself and her superpowers linked with Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris) and new teenage superhero Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani), aka Miss Marvel. These three powerful women must team up to stop Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton), the ruler of a struggling civilization who has set her eyes on taking resources from thriving planets. However many secrets about Carol's past resurface as they do so.Iman Vellani's performance as Kamala Khan overpowers the movie with a new side of joy to the MCU. Her explosive personality bursts through the screen as a huge highlight throughout the entire film. I love her character as she brings it to life with a passion. There are so many insane plot twists throughout the film and, while most are a great addition to the plot, a few get a little too crazy for my liking; though they aren't wild enough to drag the movie down. I enjoyed the plot being based around three strong women who are in charge. It's something not seen as often in superhero movies, especially in the past, but the MCU has been doing it a lot recently and it's very empowering. My favorite part of the movie is towards the beginning when Monica, Kamala and Carol first discover their powers have been entangled and they find themselves fighting soldiers in three different places and switching back and forth between locations throughout the battle. It's super fun to watch and my eyes were glued to the screen.The message of The Marvels is that true friends and family will love you and always be there for you no matter what. Carol learns this throughout the movie as she sometimes worries about what the people who care for her will think about her past; eventually, she accepts that they will love her for who she is now and not what she's done before.I give The Marvels 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. It releases in theaters November 10, 2023.By Kendall B., KIDS FIRST!","8 out of 32 found this helpful.

But who watches these for the plot?It was a much better production than some of the recent output. The CGI was mostly good, the music was well chosen, the editing and costuming was good. It's was just good.The reason to watch this was the cast. The three leads are all great actors, the chemistry is good and none overpowers the others to steal scenes. It felt like a real ensamble piece in a way marvel hasn't put out in a while.In terms of wider marcel universe I don't think this will end up being important, but it was a low stakes fun movie. It's not trying to win a best picture oscar, it's just trying to be a popcorn movie. And it nails that.As a caveat, I will say the only truly bad looking effect in the whole movie is the character you'll see in a post credit sequence.","8 out of 32 found this helpful.

Was it world changing? Not really, but you know what? I enjoyed that. It was funny, it had characters go through growth that a twelve year old needs to hear as a lesson and in the end that's the main target group; 12 year old needs and if I was a 12 year old nerd I would be in love with this movie.The design was once again very marvellous, very colorful and fun to watch, the characters were really enjoyable because they were realistic, the acting was whatever you'd assume from a Superhero movie, the lines were sometimes a little bit cringe, there were no huge hard scenes to act so I can't comment on that. What I can comment on is the action and they really nailed that, I greatly enjoyed the different approach to fighting scenes for once.One thing that I think people leave out of mind when they comment on the movie, is that this was the beginning. You can't compare this to endgame (which has been a build up movie, 20 movies have lead up to that one) and it's impossible to do the same thing with this new movie, for a build up movie it was really good though and I'm looking forward to see more movies like this.","7 out of 27 found this helpful.

Captain Marvel; Kamala Khan, a Pakistani-American teenager with shape-shifting abilities; and Monica Rambeau, a former Air Force pilot with photon-manipulating powers. As they navigate their own challenges, their paths converge in an epic battle against a formidable enemy, testing their strength, resilience, and the power of unity.The film's openness to representation and diversity reflects the changing nature of superhero stories. It celebrates the strength and complexity of its female protagonists, offering a refreshing departure from traditional male-dominated superhero stories. The inclusion of Kamala Khan, Marvel's first Muslim character to headline a comic book series, adds a significant cultural dimension to the narrative and will resonate with audiences seeking authentic and inclusive representation.The plot weaves together personal journeys, cosmic conflicts, and the enduring spirit of heroism. It explores questions of self, agency, and the consequences of one's actions. The tone strikes a balance between exhilarating action sequences and heartfelt moments, capturing the essence of Marvel's trademark blend of spectacle and emotional depth.Brie Larson, Iman Vellani, and Teyonah Parris deliver compelling performances, infusing their characters with depth and charisma. Larson's portrayal of Captain Marvel exudes confidence and vulnerability, while Vellani's Kamala Khan brings infectious energy and relatability to the screen. Parris shines as Monica Rambeau, embodying resilience and determination. The film's leading actors have great chemistry, which makes for an interesting and lively group performance.Director Nia DaCosta brings a distinct visual style to the film, blending dynamic camerawork with stunning special effects. The cosmic landscapes and high-octane action sequences are brought to life with breathtaking cinematography, immersing us in the grandeur of the Marvel universe. Stunning visuals are produced through the expert blending of practical and digital effects.The film's soundtrack complements the narrative, enhancing pivotal moments with evocative musical cues. The editing maintains a brisk pace, propelling the story forward while allowing poignant beats to resonate. The balance between kinetic action and introspective character moments is skilfully maintained, ensuring a highly enjoyable viewing experience.The film's exploration of female empowerment and solidarity is powerful, offering a timely and inspiring message. The dynamic interplay between the central characters, coupled with the film's visual splendour, creates an immersive and emotionally resonant journey.While The Marvels excels in its portrayal of multifaceted female protagonists and its visual spectacle, certain plot elements may feel familiar to seasoned superhero enthusiasts, and the pacing occasionally rushes through character development. But The Marvels is a must-see for fans of superhero cinema, offering a potent blend of action, heart, and representation. The film's positive message and excellent acting make it a welcome addition to the MCU canon. With its exhilarating visuals and compelling characters, The Marvels is a superpowered spectacle that soars.","7 out of 27 found this helpful.

Yes, it helps to have seen the Ms. Marvel series to get the full context on Kamala Khan and her family.What I saw was a fast-paced, funny, and somewhat emotional movie. Each character gets a chance to shine, and the various worlds and setups had me laughing out loud.Personally, I've disliked the incessant push towards the next big bad (Kang/multiverse). The early MCU thrived on character-development, building a story for each hero, so that when the Avengers finally Assembled, it meant something.With The Marvels, MCU has a fast-paced, funny, action-packed, character-driven gem. Kamala and her family are hysterical, Monica Rambeau is trying to find her place, and Carol Danvers works through some hidden emotional baggage to tie them all together.No, this is not a manly, testosterone-laden big boom movie. Nor is it high, artful cinema. Too much of the recent MCU takes itself too seriously. Instead, The Marvels is a fun romp, with meaningful characters and some fantastic absurdity.","8 out of 33 found this helpful.

Their individual and intertwined stories are where it's at, thanks much more to the tremendous charisma and chemistry of the stars (including especially the typical underserved villain) than the script. The script is adequate.And the action and humor and sheer SPECTACLE were all TOP NOTCH which is where this film distinguishes itself from most of that we've seen the past several years.

There is no big continuity requirement, no MASSIVE run time, no gut-wrenching sorrow. It's just fun. Nia DaCosta delivered an entertaining film with a witty story by herself, Elissa Karasik, and. Megan McDonnell. Brie Larson and Teyonah Parris do the heavy dramatic lifting but Iman Vellani brings the heart and is a worthy spring-green-bright-eyed-hero successor to Peter Parker. But the real delight here is Zawe Ashton. Her villain, Dar-Benn is is just a blast. Ashton could be excused for clocking in, collecting her check, and moving on. Instead she is having fun and so are we.I've heard there are some negative reviews. Some harsh comments, even. I grew up reading the comics. This movie is a slice of delight and DaCosta takes us to worlds beyond even the fancy of deadline-pressed panel artists.No, the Marvels is not perfect. But with more heart than the Multiverse of Madness and better balance than Love and Thunder, The Marvels does rank with Guardians 3 as the best Marvel film since Avengers Infinity War.In short, it's a lot of fun and that's what we need just now. Check it out.","5 out of 18 found this helpful.

It was great. It's a fun, fast paced, action packed, classic comic book type movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. It's also grounded with a ton of heart. In many ways, each Marvel is coming to terms with who they are. I was throughly engaged with the characters. The three Marvels are very charming and endearing, and I cannot wait to see more of them individually and together. The movie actually made me laugh and smile, as opposed to the overly heavy, dark, depressing, and broody movies that have dominated the MCU for over a decade. And the Khan family is great. Watch The Marvels on a Friday or Saturday night with popcorn, relax and be entertained! Tip: It helps to have watched the movies and TV shows that lead into it - Captain Marvel, Wandavision, and Ms. Marvel before watching this (which I had). It's time for Marvel movies to be fun again, which this undoubtedly is! Watch for yourself and enjoy!","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

Super fun and captivating. The marvels brought me immense joy by seeing Kamala Khan and Monica Rambeau on the big screen. Iman's portrayal adds a delightful touch to the movie, capturing the essence of the character perfectly. The filmmakers wisely avoided overusing her character, allowing her to shine without overshadowing the storyline.I appreciate how they depicted her realistically as a kid in the midst of war or battling a major villain. The movie introduces intriguing elements to the MCU, creating anticipation for future developments and contributing to an exciting overarching narrative.I look forward to what Marvel has in store. Despite biases, it's essential to recognize that everyone has their own story, and Marvel consistently excels at bringing comics to life.To those wondering whether to watch it, I strongly recommend it! Disregard negative reviews; conveying hate is often easier than expressing praise. Critics of this movie likely weren't Marvel fans to begin with and are merely joining a bandwagon they claim to reject, yet here they are, commenting at the end of the day.I typically don't write reviews, but the unwarranted hate this movie receives compelled me to speak out. I encourage other quiet fans like me to share their positive experiences and not let the naysayers ruin the Marvel experience for us.","11 out of 56 found this helpful.

Not even the type of issues that plagued wakanda forever. It did have some less heinous issues, but I'm surprised at the reactions. I'm thinking it could be that ms marvel and Wanda vision are required prerequisites. Also, the background of the antagonist is left til halfway through whereas I believe it really should be a prologue. Also some cuts are tonally clashing and really undercuts the emotions. There are plenty of lines that should be cut and some things which are foreshadowed that don't come to fruition. It's not perfect by any means, but I did enjoy it for the most part and it doesn't seem to suffer from 'the formula'. I really do wonder what are the major issues some other people are having, because I just didn't see the issues I've heard repeated by many different people.","8 out of 38 found this helpful.

After an endless stream of MCU projects since Infinity Stones, that just seemed like the director was trying to hit the same emotions that Marvel fans had during the OG avengers. This movie is not trying to win an Oscar, it is trying to entertain and it definitely did that. It kept my 4 and 6 year old, as well as my husband and I, fully engaged.It was fun, it was at times silly, but it also had great action sequences. Ms Marvel/Kamala Khan was wonderfully portrayed and was the perfect counterpoint to the seriousness of Captain Marvel and Monica Rambeau.This is a movie that I would gladly watch again and I will definitely be purchasing when it is released.","5 out of 22 found this helpful.

Larson as Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel brings a lot of emotion in a very smart subtle way. Parris does a lot with her time in the role of Monica and I hope to see more of her in the future. Vellani's Kamala Khan has a bright eyed, and most importantly, enthusiastic energy that starts off as a mild irritation to both Carol and Monica but becomes an endearing emotional catharsis by the end of the film for them both.The action is very well framed and there are some great moments that legitimately made me say ""whoa"" with how clever they are. On top of this there are several laugh out loud moments. The villain doesn't get too much character development, but frankly this is The Marvels showcase and it works well enough to understand the stakes.Overall it's just so much fun. There's a lot I didn't expect or predict which is a great thing to have this late in the MCU.

She absolutely owns her role and carries the whole film on her shoulders. Her performance is so spot-on that it makes the whole thing work.Now, the writing? It's kind of goofy, and the whole movie doesn't take itself too seriously. It's clear nobody was trying to make some deep, meaningful statement - they were just out to make a fun movie.

First off, the best CBM (comic book movie) in 2023 remains Across The Spiderverse (my favourite live action CBM remains GotG3).But The Marvels is a really fun, action packed film that had us laughing throughout. Really enjoyed the fight sequence choreography in particular. This film also looks good (except 1 ""Superman"" flying scene at the start).For the first time since Shang Chi & No Way Home in 2020, there were great cameos that actually helped make it feel like part of the greater connected universe something that's been sorely lacking in the MCU since 2020. Yes Dr Strange had cameos, but most of those were nothing more.However, there's a scene about 60% into this rather short, quick paced film that feels superfluous & wholly unnecessary: a singing, colourful ""Disney"" esque planet, which pulled me out of the film completely.And I can understand the desire to tap into the K Drama, K Pop world's recent surge in popularity, but Park Seo Joon (What's Wrong with Secretary Kim, Itaewon Class) can't speak English, and it shows.Ok Taecyeon (Vincenzo, Bring it on Ghost), Ahn Hyo-seop (Abyss, Business Proposal, A Time Called You) are both fluent in English. Heck, Song Joong Ki's English would have sufficed.Finally, it's absolutely baffling that a problem Captain Marvel solves at the end, the short solution somehow escaped her realization for 30 years??Despite these complaints, this is a really fun, face paced but flawed film. Brie Larsen isn't given enough to do, Teyonah Paris *is* Monica, but Iman Vellani steals the show.8.3/10, B+","4 out of 17 found this helpful.

I don't think there was enough backstory about the villain. Usually in marvel, they make us care about the villain, but in this scenario, I found myself not caring at all just because it just feels like a big bad villain that needed to be stopped as opposed to someone with a goal and values on the agenda.Moreover, Carol Danvers was good as usual but in some things she felt like she didn't really want to be there at least that's how it felt like it.All in all, it was a really funny, lighthearted movie carried by Eman Valini, and her family, with some noticeable shortcomings mainly related to the villain and Carol Danvers performance.","6 out of 32 found this helpful.

But this one finally has all good ingredients which were successfully used many times in the first saga: unexpected humor, often coming from comparing the fantastic with the ordinary life, personal moments, moments of joy and moments of sadness, great sci-fi visuals, a villain whom we can sympathize, semi-complex but logical plot. The connections with previous movies and series come just in time to link some open ends in the saga. I would say that it is harder and harder to keep MCU movies self-contained and they are becoming more of episodes of a bigger story. To me this is a plus and if one has the background, they could see in a small scene or in a single line a lot more than what can be expressed with hundreds of words. It is actually becoming marvellous!I do not understand this wave of negative reviews. Is it a campaign against Marvel? Or are people's expectations very high after Infinity War and Endgame? A movie based on comics has to be comic in the first place! And if we add some sci-fi, attempted to be somehow ""scientifically"" explained, and add a few personal stories, we receive a good Marvel product. As a conclusion, The Marvels is as fresh as the GOTG 1 plus it develops the Multiverse saga. Nuff said!","6 out of 40 found this helpful.

"10","/10","The Marvels is a spectacular superhero movie!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9569514/?ref_=tt_urv","Gojira1963","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur36205980/?ref_=tt_urv","17 January 2024","The Marvels is a comic book movie through and through and I mean that in a good way. My favorite superhero movies are those that tell a good and interesting story using drama, fantasy along with some humor and the Marvels hits all of those marks in a fantastic way.The movie stars Brie Larson as Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel, Teyonah Parris as Monica Rambeau, and Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan / Ms. Marvel, and the great Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury.There is great chemistry between the three lead actresses and Iman Vellani truly shines as Ms. Marvel. Brie Larson is an amazing actress and she makes the penultimate and quintessential Captain Marvel, a role she was born to play. Teyonah Parris as Monica Rambeau is amazing and the relationship she has with Captain Marvel and the issues the two bring to the movieq are well examined and form the core of this movie's heart and souls.Samuel L. Jackson reprises his role as Nick Fury. Every single movie that Samuel L. Jackson is in, is made 10x better just because he is in it. The Marvels is no exception. This version of Nick Fury is a bit more fun and light-hearted and is a refreshing addition to the movie.Zawe Ashton is excellent as Dar-Benn and a worthy opponent to the Marvels. Dar-Benn is the Kree leader who is trying to restore her homeland after a civil war, a civil war sparked by Captain Marvel after she unleashed retribution for how she had been treated in the first film, and how the Kree unjustly treated the Skrull for many years. As for all good villains, Dar-Benn sparks some empathy toward her motives even though in the end those motives are destructive.My only negative toward this movie is how underutilized is Zenobia Shroff as Muneeba Khan: Kamala's mother. In Ms. Marvel, Zenobia Shroff stole the show as Kamala's controlling but very loving mother. We do get that here in the Marvels I just wanted more. They say the best acting is done when you cannot tell the person is acting. Zenobia Shroff is that type of actor. She so owns this character you cannot tell she is just acting a part. She is a delight as Kamala's mother and I wanted to see more of her and hope we do see more of her in the future.","5 out of 32 found this helpful.

"","","One more bad review!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9610444/?ref_=tt_urv","haroot_azarian","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur70438655/?ref_=tt_urv","8 February 2024","One hour and forty-five minutes too long! Absolutely stupid movie with a stupid plot. Captain Marvel was far better than this diatribe. The only characters who were still consistently good were Brie, Samuel and Tessa, all the rest were rubbish. Kamala and Spiderman are in a strong tie for the worst and most annoying Marvel characters!The music selection was absolutely terrible and at points really really annoying especially 17:55 to 21:00 range in the fighting scenes.For a minute I thought it was a Bollywood movie, with all the singing and dancing which was nonsensical. The other two MCU movies which were made at the same time, the new Thor and Guardians of the Galaxy movies were far better than this rubbish! I don't know what DaCosta was thinking to be honest!And yes it is ridiculous how Monica the daughter is two months older than Mary the mother in real life! Was there really a shortage of actresses to play Monica? Really? One more bad review!","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"","","nothing to Mar-Vell at","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9573541/?ref_=tt_urv","Special-K88","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1596208/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2024","The MCU's 33rd film serves as further proof that the once thriving comic book juggernaut is now running on fumes. For reasons not explained very well, the world-weary Carol Danvers, scientific Monica Rambeau, and youthful Kamala Khan form a trifecta when their electromagnetically altered powers put them in a switchy entanglement situation. With all that going on, they then tangle with the villainous Dar-Benn (looking like the illegitimate daughter of Ronan--cough, cough) who's using her hammer thingy in the name of Hala to siphon atmospheres as vengeance against the ""annihilator."" The production costs of this Marvel Comics misstep may have been a king's ransom but the results certainly aren't worthy of royal adulation; tonally it's all over the place with familial sentiment, goofy humor that belongs in a sitcom, random song and dance, and other poorly developed subplots. Vellani has the most pep in her step, Larson looks a bit aloof, Parris does what she can do, meanwhile big bad Ashton clenches her teeth a lot but doesn't get to do anything interesting. The lowest grossing MCU picture to date generated some controversy as perturbed cast and crew members insinuated that external factors contributed to its downfall, but given the quality of the finished results it's pretty easy to balk at that. Memo to Marvel: you may want to revamp your product, otherwise you'll continue to disintegrate and put out subpar showings like this one. **","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
