"7","/10","More films need to be directed by stuntmen","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6353244/?ref_=tt_urv","Vartiainen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30163554/?ref_=tt_urv","10 December 2020","Extraction stars Chris Hemsworth and was produced by the Russo brothers. It was directed by Sam Hargrave in his directorial debut. He has previously made a career as a stuntman, most notably as a stunt coordinator in several Marvel movies. And that definitely shows in the film. This film contains some of the nicest action set pieces seen in years.Unfortunately, this comes at a price. Namely that of an interesting story. While the story of Extraction - a gun for hire (Hemsworth) shooting his way through Bangladesh in order to rescue the kidnapped son of a drug lord - is perfectly serviceable, it's also nothing to write home about. The characters are shallowly written and while they're acted well enough, the main attraction of the film are those action scenes.That being said, those are definitely good enough on their own to justify the price of admission. Hemsworth gives an electrifying performance as a man spread too thin by all the violence he has caused, while Randeep Hooda gives an equally memorable performance as his foil and counterpart.And it's just plain fun to watch. If you have a soft spot for those 80s action films such as Commando or Rambo, then this is definitely worth checking out.","145 out of 156 found this helpful.

Long, gorgeous takes with brutally grounded fight scenes, showcase the vicious nature of warfare. Hemsworth carries this entire film on his shoulders and has the daunting task of elevating the paper thin narrative to an acceptable level. Thankfully, he succeeds. Thor can act darn it, and in this film he proves it yet again.Like Jon Wick before him, seeing Hemsworth kicking ass in amazingly choreographed fight scenes, is exhilarating. The film is unapologetically honest in its depiction of violence and its consequences. Riding on fantastic sound design, every impact, bullet wound and car crash pulls you in deeper and deeper in the film.","251 out of 281 found this helpful.

Close combat with extremely long shots in tight spaces. Sometimes it has a shooter video game feel to it. Hemsworth and the stunt team really showed of their skills. This movie is really more about close combat scenes, than crazy Hollywood stunts a la mission Impossible. Other than that, all the story is already in the title, which is fine for this type of movie. The actor, who played the boy was a wonderful casting choice. He was carrying the whole emotion of story. We'll be seeing more of him. Other characters were not drawn out. This movie is not for everyone, it is not well rounded, it's all action and no story. I personally enjoyed it though. I recommend this for viewers that like close combat action and martial arts movies.","865 out of 1,120 found this helpful.

And I'm glad to report that 'Extraction' was worth the wait. It isn't a flawless movie, but it certainly has some good things going for it. The action sequences were probably the highlight of the film for me. I'm not usually someone who appreciates or even notices good action sequences, but I did with this film which says something. There is one sequence that really blew me away. It is a one-shot sequence that goes on for quite some time and has some amazing ingenuity behind it. Definitely the highlight of the film.Chris Hemsworth was right at home in this role. He doesn't have to do a lot of speaking, and can just let his actions speak for themselves. Some of the stunt work in this film would not have been easy. When he is required to slow things down and have some dialogue in the odd scene he does so adequately.The film surprised me with just how violent it was willing to be at times, especially in scenes involving children. There were a couple of time where I thought - they're not going to do that are they? - and then sure enough they did. This is a very serious film as well. Very little (if any that I can think of) humour whatsoever makes an appearance.The film does get a little tedious towards the end. You can only watch so many people getting shot without becoming numb and a little bored by it. Also the film opens with a shot from near the end of the film. It doesn't work though because there is no intrigue behind it. This was one of the few poor choices an otherwise very good film made however. I would recommend giving this one a watch.","350 out of 502 found this helpful.

Really? Most action movies out there... how many have a plausible plot? At least for this movie, the plot is plausible, the action, obviously a stretch. But those critics railing on the movie forget what a movie is supposed to be all about. Entertainment. It's not a real life documentary, not an ensemble boring drama piece. When it comes to wham-bang entertainment, this movie delivers on all cylinders. The movie is probably more analogous to a version of masterful The Raid than an Oscar drama piece. Live with it. Watch it. Enjoy. It is a movie. It will keep you glued. Though the squeamish may need to take a break.","196 out of 249 found this helpful.

A skilled mercenary named Tyler (Chris Hemsworth) has been contracted to extract a drug dealer's kidnapped son. It's pretty much a suicide mission, but Tyler didn't need even the slightest coaxing to take the job. He didn't even ask the price. Some odd hours later he's in Bangladesh, kid in tow, shooting his way out of a sticky situation.This ballsy grimy film took you through the muck in style. The camera angles and continuous action shots were fresh as it followed Tyler from one point to the next while he shot and fought John Wick style to his extraction point. ""Extraction"" was raw at times, shocking at other times, and even moving at times. It's a no frills visceral form of action that keeps you at the edge of your seat and constantly engaged.

Extraction sees Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), a black market mercenary, embark on the most deadly extraction of his career when he's enlisted to rescue the kidnapped son (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) of an imprisoned international crime lord.As much as their originals are hit and miss and the sheer amount of content they release being ridiculous, there is no question that Netflix allow pure filmmaker freedom without the restrictions and interference of Hollywood influence as here the film is allowed to make full use of its 18 rating and not have the burden of setting up or continuing a franchise. Though generic and cliche in its story telling, the action and stunt work are an absolute blast to witness and make this a step up from what I was expecting.The film's 2 hour runtime may have some filler sequences around the middle section, but the 1st and 3rd acts are fast paced and frantic, throwing you right into the situation, the film knows exactly what it wants and sets out to deliver it. The race against time and constant improvisation of the extraction itself makes for a consistently engaging watch, though the film does brush over motivations (the villain here is especially lacklustre) and character back story, with Tyler solely relying on a few flashbacks and essentially an exposition interview with the kid he is protecting, so that we get more of his story.However what this basic premise does allow for is to be filled with brutal, well choreographed and creative action. This film delivers one of the best set pieces of this year, with a phenomenal one-take style 15 minute sequence, which goes from a car chase, to a building assault to a lorry chase, it's absolute controlled chaos. As a fan of John Wick, The Raid etc. it was excellent to see their influence on the choreography, the camerawork never is too shaky or quick cutting meaning it is easy to follow and witness every stab, punch, kick in their bone crunching and visceral glory. The shootouts sound great and are intense, always ending in bloody results, especially the finale sequence.It's good seeing Hemsworth in a grittier, darker non-Thor/MIB role and he delivers here in a more somber and focused role, though also channels some of the action hero vibe of the 80/90's that this film is going for. Jaiswal is also good here as the kid thrown into this life or death situation, he is never irritating or acts unrealistically at all (which is the case with kids in these types of films at times). Randeep Hooda has an intimidating screen presence as someone working for the kid's father and David Harbour gives an enthusiastic performance, though his character's section does stall the plot pacing.Extraction is a fun watch to turn your brain off for 2 hours and was actually better than I expected. The action is bloody, visceral and frantic with some brilliant practical effects and choreography and the cast give good performances. The film does suffer from several cliches and genre traits and lack of character depth, but honestly from a purely entertainment perspective this does the job.","160 out of 260 found this helpful.

The story is pretty basic, nothing you have to think about, just some machos shooting around. That said the action scenes are good, above the mediocre stuff we're sometimes bombarded with, but you can't be too picky as there will be some guys being run over by cars, shot at plenty of times and still moving around like they can't be hurt. If you can manage those kind of scenes you're in for some well shot action scenes. It's mostly about Chris Hemsworth that fits perfectly as the untouchable hero macho warrior. Extraction is just easy popcorn entertainment with a cast that did a pretty good job, with some great action scenes that are well choreographed, and some quality cinematography. They didn't spare any expenses shooting those action scenes, it's all quality. That said don't expect a deep story, it's not there, so if it's that you're looking then for just skip this one. I enjoyed it as will do others that aren't too picky.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

I'm reading the reviews about no plot... seriously? Just because there's no surprising unpredictable plot twist doesn't mean there's no plot. It was a simple story, adapted into a screenplay from the graphic novel by Ande Parks, and presented on a bullet ridden testosterone plate.

"7","/10","Extraction is Netflix's best action original of its history!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5670049/?ref_=tt_urv","msbreviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur79118814/?ref_=tt_urv","24 April 2020","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)A lot of times, people can't figure out who was really in control of a particular movie. Was the director truly the person in charge of every creative and technical choice? Were the producers the ones responsible for most of the film? Or was the cast that carried the whole thing? Extraction might be Sam Hargrave's directorial debut, but he's been a stunt coordinator in Marvel films, working with the Russo brothers in Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Endgame. The complexity of each choreography screams their names all the way through.Now, I don't want to take any credit from Hargrave! He has a clear vision of how the film should be like, and he delivers the best Netflix original action movie ever. While it's true that this last sentence doesn't really mean that much, it's genuinely great and far better than every other original action flick distributed by the streaming network. Two key components make Extraction a success: its unbelievable, jaw-dropping action, and Chris Hemsworth's extraordinary physical (and emotional) performance.I'll start with the actor. Chris Hemsworth is one of the most underrated actors working today. Everyone looks at his portrayal of Thor in the MCU, and think that he can't do anything else. First of all, Thor is one of the characters that changed the most within that universe. Chris has demonstrated both his dramatic and comedic range interpreting this superhero. However, in Extraction, not only his physical display and stunts are out of this world (he actually does quite a lot of them), but he's able to slow down and really delve into an emotionally compelling state. Brilliant performance!Nevertheless, the action steals the show. Joe and Anthony Russo help Sam Hargrave in bringing their Marvel's experience of having to balance dozens of characters at the same time, and the impressive choreography elevates the film so damn much. During the promotion campaign, people kept talking about a stunning oner (one-take sequence), which Chris Hemsworth himself described as ""the most complicated action sequence"" he's ever done... They were not joking nor overselling their movie. It's genuinely a work of art.I was so surprised by those (approximately) twelve minutes that I stopped the film, went back, and watched them again. I believe it's one of the pros that home viewing has against theaters. Just to be clear, it's not actually just one take. It's a collection of long takes ""stitched"" together to make it seem (and feel) like a oner. However, it doesn't diminish this incredibly technical achievement in any way, much on the contrary! The long takes are packed with all kinds of action: car chases, shootouts, knife fighting, hand combat, running, jumping, crawling, you name it.I'm going to put myself at risk and state that it's one of the best oners of an action flick in the last few years, especially if we don't count the two best action sagas of today (Mission: Impossible, John Wick). Throughout the whole runtime, the action is exceptionally filmed. The editing is impeccable, the excitement is always there, and the sense of urgency is never lost. It rarely gets over-the-top, every time our protagonist gets hit, cut, or even shot, it never feels like he should be down and dead. It's that base of realism inside an action movie that can make it become an outstanding success or a massive fail, and Extraction built a very solid one.This film has all the ingredients of popcorn-entertainment, and I'm confident it will get huge praise from, at least, the general public. However, it's evident that the Russo brothers and Hargrave didn't offer the screenplay the same care that they had with the action. Even though it's a pretty simple premise, the attempts at making secondary characters important or emotionally resonant fail its target completely. Even Tyler Rake gets a pretty cliche backstory that everyone has seen hundreds of times. I struggled to care for a single person or a relationship.The reason behind the whole extraction procedure being due to some drug warlords is so formulaic that it's honestly becoming annoyingly unimaginative. There isn't even a logical reason for them to be fighting each other over one's son. The movie also wraps up by leaving tons of questions unanswered regarding its plot, and with a ridiculous try at either being philosophical or actually ruining the entire thing. Finally, I was never a fan of films starting with a flashforward of the protagonist, especially in this genre. It takes away tension and suspense during the actual movie since the viewer knows the flashforward scene hasn't happened yet.In the end, Extraction is going to be remembered by its insane action and a fantastic lead performance by Chris Hemsworth. The latter is one of the most underrated actors working today, and he delivers not only a phenomenal physical performance but also an emotionally powerful display. The action is jaw-dropping at every level. The outstanding choreography plus the seamless editing are able to elevate the action into some of the best I've seen in the last few years, including a technically mind-blowing oner. The excitement levels are super high throughout the entire runtime, credit not only to the Russo brothers but also to the debutant director Sam Hargrave (who definitely leaves his mark action-wise), who all make a great film. However, the focus went all to the action, making the actual story and characters suffer from formulaic storytelling, cliche backstories, and an overall lack of emotional attachment. Still, Extraction is the best Netflix original action movie of its history, so don't miss it!Rating: B+","77 out of 184 found this helpful.

NOPE! That's because they are hypocrites! They call this movie a 'white savior' movie, simply because they want you to click on their website, that's all it is!Anyway, this movie has lots of plot holes: There were 2 opportunities where the main character could have killed his pursuer yet he didn't... this is sloppy writing and adds 2 plot holes. Considering how much trouble this pursuer gives the main character later on in the story, this writing choice was a conscious choice by the writers and they simply chose to ignore the massive plot hole that they created (twice).Also, the main character on more than one occasion chooses to not pick up a superior gun, and instead just runs around with his standard handgun... this is another plot hole and sloppy writing. I also counted at least 4 scenes where combatants engaged each other in hand-to-hand combat, despite there being a large abundance of weapons in the immediate vicinity... this is obviously done to create a false sense of drama and suspenseAnother plot hole is that in one scene the main character gets hit by a car that's going about 40kph... this is impossible seeing as the entire street was full of cars and people at that time... and then not even 1minute later, the main character hits another guy with a truck, yet as I stated previously, THE ENTIRE STREET was blocked with cars and people... so it's literally impossible for the truck to have been driven down the street, as it was blocked. That's another 2 plot holes right there.Overall, if you look past the glaring plot holes and sloppy writing, then the movie is watchable... I'd give it a 6/10... it's not NEARLY as good as Equalizer or John Wick or Taken, but if you've already watched all those movies, then I guess this movie would be OK to watch... I don't think the director (Sam Hargrave) did a particularly amazing job or a particularly poor job in his directorial debut either... we will just have to see if his next film will be any better","12 out of 23 found this helpful.

Directed by the experienced stunt coordinator and fight choreographer Sam Hargrave, ""Extraction"" is an action-packed and eye-pleasing romp of violent action, anchored by excellent stunt work and often impressive camera trickery.""Extraction"" is yet another addition to the Netflix blockbuster collection, perhaps a notch better than most before, but flawed in all the same ways. The story is based on the graphic novel ""Ciudad"" co-written by Russo brothers, who adapted it into this film script as well. It's a highly derivative plot, mirrors tens if not hundreds of other thrillers, possesses a high predictability factor, and, as a sum, is just narrow and shallow. It tends to be unrealistic, which is no biggie for a blockbuster like this one, but in the second half, specifically the finale sequence on the bridge, it got a little too far fetched. The character of Tyler Rake (cheesy, isn't it) is your usual cardboard American hero in his usual swipe-and-pick-your-action-man story arch. Where ""Extraction"" truly shines is in the action department, which, obviously, takes up most of the screen time. The first half offers many amazing and satisfyingly violent action scenes showcasing impressive choreography and a little insane camera/editing work. Around the middle of the movie we have the talky-talky interlude, after which we get back to action, this time a little weary, as it gets a tad repetitive, and the climax is plagued by some perhaps small unrealistic touches, but a little frustrating nevertheless. The performances are fine and dandy, but almost the entirety of the roles weren't much broader than one dimension. Naturally, such an action-heavy an expensive movie is coated up in good overall aesthetical design, great cinematography and an okay if a little too contemporary original score.""Extraction"" offers no revolution, not even any tweaks, but it will entertain You with great action sequences, and if You come expecting it to be for what it is, You should not be met with disappointment. My rating: 6/10.","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

Here Chris Hemsworth reduces the population of Dhaka in Bangladesh instead of Mexico.Chris Hemsworth plays Tyler Rake. An Australian mercenary with a tragic backstory who accepts a mission to rescue Ovi Mahajan. He is the son of a Mumbai drug kingpin who is in jail.The kidnapping was arranged by a Bengali drug kingpin Amir Asif. He has the police and army in Dhaka in his pocket.Saju is an ex forces operator who was hired to protect Ovi by his father. He brought in Rake and his team for the extraction but then does not pay them. Instead double crossing them and Saju plans to bring the boy back to India.Tyler finds himself alone with Ovi and fighting off Saju and Amir's men.Extraction is an high octane action movie from Sam Hargrave, a stuntman and stunt action coordinator turned director. He was the second unit director for Avengers: Endgame.Hargrave places heavy reliance on action sequences which in some ways reminiscent of the John Wick films. It also has the kind of video game violence that director David Ayer is known for in films such as Fury and End of Watch.It is not the most original of stories but it is a fine enough action film. The setting of India and Bangladesh does give it a different spin.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Hemsworth proves his acting chops more so in this, in my opinion, than in Rush (2013), and his ability to carry such a heavy and strenuous role especially in means of training. The fight choreography is stellar, and the long shots during the extensive chase scene were particularly impressive, further immersing the viewer in the tension. Other characters such as the boy were all depicted so realistically and humanly, even the ""bad guy."" There was really nobody that didn't deliver and that's what made the movie even more engaging. How it was ended, like the last thirty seconds, I also have to applaud.","11 out of 16 found this helpful.

It's during this sequence that the sheer impressiveness of the filmmaking - the complex camerawork, the tight choreography, the painful stunts - begins to outweigh the piece's narrative shortcomings. Unfortunately, those shortcomings really are quite significant and they start to seep back into the fray once the film inevitably cuts away from its magnum opus. Really, the story is about as bare-bones as you can get, with its generic characters and often-seen situations serving only to get it from set-piece to set-piece. To start with, the flick is actually rather dull. Even the first action sequence doesn't feel impactful because you don't care about anyone involved with it. After a certain point, though, the thing becomes a lot more engaging. It starts to seep some actual character from the gaps in its violence and, even if this is still basic stuff, it helps carry you through to the end of the slightly-too-long plot. The movie takes itself pretty seriously but it's still firmly in the realm of 'turn your brain off' fun. It's rather exciting when it gets going and, ultimately, it is enjoyable. It's lucky that the action is as genuinely good as it is, because it's the only thing that will keep you watching. 6/10","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Hemsworth is a great choice for this movie, he did perfectly with so fluent movements and acted just like a lethal human weapon, but in the end only proved that he is still a human with flesh and blood. The constant chases and fight scenes are great, almost no null at all, but the storyline is kind of one dimensional predictable, still fall into a format that already been used thousand times, it won't feel interesting enough if Hemsworth didn't put his heart and soul into that character, a Greek tragic hero who is doomed from the very beginning. His persistence trying and never wants to give up his promise is highly recommendable; once agreed to carry out a mission, he would die trying to deliver it; money or no money, that's a real hero's Achilles fate.The whole movie was shot in such a filthy and pathetic backgrounds, the cities, the underground sewerage that you could even smell the stench and the odor, yet it seems these countries didn't suffer the worst pandemic situation so far as America.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Mercenary Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is recruited to rescue the boy.Sam Hargrave is the stunt coordinator for the Russo brothers and they seem to have given him his first chance at directing a full length feature. He does a perfectly adequate job with the highlight being the action sequences as one would expect from an experienced stunt coordinator. That's not to say that this is one stunt after another. There are some good stuff in between. The exterior locations are exotic. There are some good Indian actors in the villain roles. The roof top scene with the kids is fun. I would suggest a different way to go with Ovi. I would go younger and make it a girl to heighten the danger. It should be Man on Fire. One thing that does occur to me. Hemsworth is doing his Rambo in this movie and he could do the remake.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

There's a ten minute-plus seemingly one-shot action sequence that is absolutely outstanding. The fights are so brutal and each more creative than the last. John Wick showed that having stunt coordinators direct action movies could be a winning formula. Extraction is another example of this as the Russo Brothers hired their Avengers stunt coordinator for this project. It's lacking the sleekness of John Wick, but goes in a different direction with a raw, gritty approach to action and a real Call of Duty vibe. Chris Hemsworth is great and this is easily one of his best performances outside of Thor. The story is pretty by-the-numbers, but Extraction's incredible action makes this a worthwhile watch.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

In this movie their is no similarity with Dhaka, Bangladesh. They didn't take any shot either ( In Bangladesh).
when they were talking in Bangla (Language) it was like a little kid trying to learn his own language. I have a question, how an actor like Chris Hemsworth shot this kind of movie without knowing about that country? They represented Bangladesh ( with misinformation) but no Bangladeshies was in this movie which is really ridiculous.
Overall this movie is very far from the reality of Dhaka.","122 out of 265 found this helpful.

What was promised in the trailer, was more or less delivered in the film. And the purists be damned.There is relentless action. I didn't count but I believe Hemsworth would have slayed 200+ soldiers in the 100 minute run time. The action set pieces are designed to blow you away. There is one in particular, a 10 minute long, one - shot sequence that should make watching this worth your while.The story is as long as it's IMDb summary. There is nothing more to it. It is meant to appeal to the lowest common denominator and that it does in almost every frame.Hemsworth doesn't have much to do, in the acting department. He has to sling a machine gun or draw a knife and kill/maim every living being, be it a boy or a man, that he comes across.
Randeep Hooda gets a surprisingly long bit and does as good as he can.There would be detractors who would cry about the lack of aesthetics and a deep storyline, about big wasteful budget. But, that is what was promised in the trailer and that is what it delivers in dollops.If you are in the mood for mindless action, look no further.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

An action packed film taking place in India that looks and feels like a shooter video game. The legions of heavily armed yet easily killed enemies, the switch from shooting to stabbing to sniping to reckless driving that seems to happen to everybody at the same time, the evil mastermind, the henchmen and you, the killer of dozens, saving the life of a kid. It's a nice action film, but completely pointless otherwise.Bottom line: I am glad that after 20 years from Way of the Gun they rediscovered how to do shooting scenes.

It's simple, raw, and packed with great action. We need more action movies like this.The plot is quite simple. A mercenary soldiers were tasked to save kidnapped son of a drug lord. At first the mission looks like it will run smoothly until they found out they were betrayed. Now surrounded in a city full of enemies, our protagonist and the kid have to survive and find their way out.I like the camera work here. The way they shoot close to the main character make us feel like we are included in the action. Feels like this happened just besides us. We are not movie goers, we are witnesses.And the action is top notch. The fighting sequence is brutal. From hand to hand combat, gun fighting, and sniper fight they all well executed. No wonder the body count is so high.The acting is also good. Even with the full action. The writers put nice background stories to the characters that make us sympathize to them. The actors delivered their best performance here.I don't really have big complain here. As an action movie, The Extraction is one of the best.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Another great action movie produced by Netflix that people should watch this summer and have fun. This movie draws a lot of inspiration from other movies like: The Bodyguard, Mile 22, 3:10 to yuma and etc. All these movies have the same features: the relationship between two very different characters and delivering a ""package"". Extraction has the same features as well, only it is done in a perfect way and without flaws. The relationship between Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) and the target Ovi is intense and draws the attention, most of their scenes together are good and create the sort of drama this film has. One of the most memorable sequences of the film is the 11 minute action sequence throughout the movie that looks like it's a one - shot. No cuts but just a full one shot sequence that is perfection with a lot of camera movements and scenery. I think I might watch the movie again just for that sequence. Chris Hemsworth is good as always, not only as a professional assassin but also in giving a real acting performance. I highly recommend for those who love action and there is plenty so enjoy.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Charakter is good and is well known (that makes you more linked with him). In Bangladesh you don't really think about the situation in your country so it's not what I thought would be in a film about fighting and war. The action scenes are nice and exciting. The film ends pretty obviously so you know there will be another film. It kinda takes the feeling and tension away you normally get on an open end film.

Probably worth the time if you enjoy modern action films. The action is solid and there's a lot of it to go around. Everything else is acceptable enough around the action. Don't go into it expecting much.Plot- Eh. It's coherent but doesn't really do or say anything. The bad guy is a comically evil dude who probably murders puppies in his off time and the hero is a ""I'm not the good guy"" but constantly takes the moral high ground. The movie spoils the last like idk 8 minutes in the first scene only to cut back to 2 days earlier. It doesn't belong in the movie and kills any tension.Acting- Fine. Nothing offensive and nothing to write home about. Chris Hemsworth sells his character well enough.Setting- Fine. It's focused and contained compared to some other action movies that just jump between like Paris, New York, and Tokyo or whatever.Action- Good but doesn't reinvent the wheel. It feels kind of like John Wick with gunfoo, long panning shots, and lots of hand to hand combat. But unlike John Wick it doesn't get particularly creative with weapons, style, or environment.Watch it. Or don't. Your life won't change much either way.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Tyler is former Australian SAS but is haunted by the loss of his own son. Once in Dhaka he manages to retrieve the boy from his captors but getting him safely out of the city won't be easy. His erstwhile kidnapper is determined to get him back and he controls a corrupt police colonel who shuts down the city to hunt for them... if that weren't enough Saju, a former member of Indian special forces working for the boy's father, is determined to take to boy to avoid paying for the rescue.It must be stated the plot is both unlikely and rather simple... that doesn't matter though; it is there to provide a reason for the action and that action is great. From start to finish the action barely lets up... much of what happens from the moment of Rake rescues Ovi feels as if it is set in real time with camera work that puts the viewer right in the middle. Instead of the frequent cuts favoured by some directors we gets scenes that look like a single take. The action includes numerous shootings, chases on foot and in vehicles and a near-obligatory exploding helicopter. Chris Hemsworth really impresses as Tyler Rake as does Randeep Hooda as Saju; the rest of the cast are solid enough too. With its near non-stop violence this certainly won't be for everybody but if you want an action movie and enjoyed films like 'John Wick' and 'The Raid' this is sure to appeal to you.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

2) I'm glad the film is full of graphic violence and swearing rather than trying to be family friendly
3) There are two good character moments, which is two better than zero I guess
4) David Harbour shows up for 5 minutes and looks like he's having fun while presumably picking up a very large amount of money for a very small roleNEGATIVES:1) It's half an hour longer than it should be, that extra half an hour is complete dross
2) Hemsworth survives so many impossible injuries; at one point we spend about 5 minutes with him putting a cast on and then as soon as the action restarts he just rips the cast off and suffers no consequences??
3) I just didn't care about any of the characters, at best the film is just emotionless action
4) I hate films that start with a scene from the end for absolutely no reason whatsoever
5) There are so many times where foreign characters are speaking their native language and then just randomly switch to English halfway through their conversation just so the audience don't have to read too many subtitles","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It happens that the teenager that was abducted happens to be the only son of a known drug cartel in India, his name also happens to be Ovi Mahajan except that he is a""senior"" while his son is a ""junior"" in which the father is serving time in prison. And that when the son was kidnapped, that he was kidnapped by a rival gangster who lives in Dhaka, Bangladesh by the name of Amir Astif (Priyanshu Painyuli). Because Saju Rav (Randeep Hooda), Ovi's right hand man has a limited time limit into bringing him safely back as he has insufficient funds, that he needed to resort to him employing mercs, head by Nik Khan (Golshifteh Farahani) to do the job. And that is when Chris Hemsworth comes in, he plays Tyler Rake relaxing in Australia as he is informed by Nik Kahn that 14 year old Ovi Mahagan JR is the ""extraction""- hence the title. And of course, not everything is going accordingly, as it was soon revealed that the guy who employed them Saju Rav also happens to be ex-special forces himself, as Amir of Dhaka has a stranglehold over the entire city including the police force and much of the army with odds totally stacked against the star Tyler, making the saving situation much more difficult which is nothing more but to serve as a backdrop to the many staged action sequences shown throughout.As I had said above, although ""Extraction"" would have been much enjoyed in the big screen it's still owned by Netflix. I mean, there's still a fair amount of people who do not have a Netflix account, like the homeless and the middle class who prefer to save a buck, some do not even have internet service. Therefore, Netflix will never know how much more money they would have made had ""Extraction"" gotten a proper theatrical screening, as opposed to Netflix using wasted time cracking down users who share their Netflix accounts. That the reason was so that they are able to finance more series and more movies, than I just have to say that their is another route, and that is to give them a proper theatrical release since they're other ways to see Netflix produced movies or TV shows than to have an account.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

While there were elements of the story that were slightly derivative, overall I connected a lot with the characters throughout and found the movie not only immersive with the fight sequences but also the storytelling. It's weird because I hated John Wick but loved this movie. It just treated violence differently where it wasn't meant to be feel good, but instead felt more disturbing (as it should). I thought certain dramatic moments could have benefited from less cutting and more of the same immersive feel of the action sequences. Wouldn't have minded it being a little slower to contrast with the absolutely bonkers fight scenes.

In addition to the fight choreography and action sequences being riveting and gripping, the stunt-work and physical performance by Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda is the highlight of this film - who manage to convince the audiences of them being skilled and trained military men.The films opens on its strength of great action and close combat sequence, hooking me within the first act itself without spending too much time in the exposition. However, the midpoint slows down in pace, in an attempt to build on the relationship between Tyler Rake and the kid he has rescued. The relationship doesn't come across as genuine - but rather a sentimentality that seems falsified, contrived for narrative purpose, which makes this portion all the more boring.The weakest aspect of this film are its subplots. Particularly, the plot-line with David Harbor's character ends up being inconsequential, without revealing anything important about the character or his past with Tyler. Another plot-line - about the kid's father being a drug lord - establishes an arc of their relationship that ends up abandoned and unresolved. Overall, the story of Extraction feels incomplete, with its resolution rushed for the sake of finishing the plot - which makes the screenplay of this film weak and forgettable.""Extraction"" makes for a good casual watch, with exciting action but an unremarkable story that you probably won't remember in the coming weeks.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The action sequences are top notch with the whole ""one take"" fluid style that was captured nicely. Hemsworth's character (Tyler Rake) was a little different than I'm used to as in he feels more human and so does the villain which makes for some great back and forth between the two. The movie was not overly complicated like a Bourne film nor was it nearly as good but some of the chemistry between characters and the cat and mouse aspects and a couple of twists really engage the audience. It also does set up for a potential sequel if the writers felt compelled to do so.

Sure, we have seen this before.The amount of violence is very high, and the kill ratios are reminiscent more of a first person shooter than a real combat situation (the opponents always wait to fire, and patiently take head shots), but that is not in itself different from any other Western action flick. Those who remember Arnie mow down dozens in Commando without changing his clip will hardly find cause to complain.Bangladeshi viewers who find this movie's depiction of Bangla armed forces as corruptible have a cause to feel aggrieved. But seriously, after decades of Western cops shown as bent in cinema, it is fine if the reality of other countries makes its way into fiction? And principal photography was done in Western India, a vastly different visual space. It is not meant to be a realistic depiction of Dhaka. The traffic snarls and nearly impossible road situations are spot-on for Dhaka, as well as the people who stand and gawp at the action (speaking as a South Asian)..Chris Hemsworth keeps the emoting light and is effective in the role he essays here. Not much more was asked of him. He is believable as a man with a deathwish who wants to go out doing one last right thing. Strong international debut for Indian action star Randeep Hooda. I think he can expect more in the future. Not sure what the people asking for a plot really think they deserve, but the amount that there was - was sufficient for me.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

You know him as Thor, but in Extraction, he brings a whole new level of badassery as Tyler Rake. The dude is a beast! He nails the physicality of the role and adds some serious depth to his character. Hemsworth's charm and charisma shine through, making it impossible not to root for him every step of the way.Now, the setting is something else. They take us to the streets of Dhaka, and man, it's chaotic and vibrant! The cinematography captures the essence of the city perfectly, and you get a real feel for the place. It's gritty, it's real, and it adds an extra punch to the story.Speaking of the story, it might not win any awards for originality, but it gets the job done. Tyler Rake is on a mission to save a kidnapped kid, and along the way, we get to explore themes of redemption and sacrifice. It's not groundbreaking stuff, but it keeps you invested in the characters and their fates.Gotta give a shout-out to Randeep Hooda as well. He plays Saju, this conflicted dude caught up in the chaos. Hooda brings his A-game and adds an interesting dynamic to the film. The chemistry between him and Hemsworth is electric, and it amps up the tension even more.On the technical side, Extraction is on point. The cinematography is stunning, the editing is sharp, and the music keeps your heart racing. All these elements work together to create an intense, adrenaline-fueled experience you won't forget anytime soon.So, to sum it up, Extraction is a crazy, action-packed thrill ride that'll leave you breathless. The action is jaw-dropping, Chris Hemsworth is a total badass, and the setting adds an extra layer of authenticity. If you're in the mood for a wild cinematic experience, grab some popcorn, turn off your brain, and buckle up for Extraction. Trust me, you won't regret it!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's just fantastic. I've seen comparisons to John Wick because both movies were directed by former stunt coordinators and have a distinct style. John Wick is a little bit smoother, polished and stylized. This one is more brutal and visceral. Both are shot excellently and choreographed wonderfully. This one has more brutal intensity with the way it plays out. There's also a lot of variety in the action. There are close corridor shootouts, big open city setting shootouts, car chases, hand-to-hand fights, knife fights, sniping type action, RPG's, one take shot action... Because of the way that it's filmed with the long takes, there's an about 30 minutes long section that basiclly plays in real time. You just feel you are right there in the movie.The other thing the movie does really well is handeling it's story.The basic plot is very straight-forward. A mercenary is trying to get a boy out of the town alive. His objective is very clear from beginning to end. However, it adds complexity, nuance and intrigue with the different characters involved and their relationships with each other.The movie does have sraight-forward and uninteresting villians that are just evil, but it also has characters that are allies to the main the mercenary, but antagonistic to the boy and allies to the boy, but antagonistic to the mercenary. There are a lot of interesting character dynamics that add tension to the action sequences. The plot is straight-forward, but it's executed with intrigue because of the characters and their dynamics.The movie has more emotion than you would expect from a fim like this. There are not any big character arcs, but you learn enough about each of the characters to care about them and their relationships. We also dive a little bit more into the side characters than you'd expect. Even some of the henchmen and assassins are given more depht. There are scenarios of why they are doing what they are doing so you care when you see them in action. Some of them you don't want to die and some of them you do.Chris Hemsworth was great in this movie. We know that he can handle action and be a leading man. This movie ups the stakes of being the here because he's doing real stuntwork. There's no green screen. You see him actually doing fight coreography. When it pauses for the character moments, he gets to really act as this broken man on a mission that's starting to see the humanity in the events. He doesn't rely on his humour or his bag of tricks to make him likeabe. It's al just about the performance and I really think he was the right man for this film.This is not a movie for everyone. This is a hard R action movie. There is violence against children that can be pretty gut-wrenching if that's not your thing. If you're looking for a deep character study or a plot driven movie this isn't that. It's an action movie for people that love that visceral expirience of watching an R-rated action movie. I love that this film got brutal and heart-wrenching. It feels like a gut-punch. Some people won't like it.The thing that holds the movie back the most is the bond that forms between Chris Hemsworth and the boy. It feels sudden. It feels ike from one converstaion to the next there's a big gap that isn't fully earned to hep us understand that transition. It needed a bit more dialogue to build that bridge from one place to the next.This is exactly the kind of movie I want Netflix to make more of. There is talent in front of and behind the camera and they took a risk on a new first time featured director. Since we're in lockdown, I think people a re going to very much enjoy this movie.9/10","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Now First about the cons of this movie, it defies logic and not sure about the body count though. The major negative is wafer thin story and script. The lead antagonist is completely miscast.
The major USP of this movie is the '11 Minute' fight sequence. It's one of the best action choreography I've seen in recent past. It was wild, raw, realistic and quite intense. Thanks to Netflix release, the censor less leverage is rightfully used. Not to mention about the cinematography especially in the stunt sequence, kudos to the legend Newton Thomas for his live cinematography.
Finally our very own Thor, we see him here as Tyler Rake. Chris's portrayal of Tyler rake was great. And it was indeed fresh to see him as such.
This movie would sure cater for adrenaline pumping movie lovers!! Grab a bucket of popcorn for a Saturday night movie!!!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Starring Chris Hemsworth in the lead role and directed by stunt coordinator Sam Hargrave, it is a generic kidnap and rescue story kept involving by its well shot action scenes and consistent performance by its main star.In Mumbai, India, Ovi Mahajan Jr (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the son of a notorious Indian drug lord, is kidnapped and held to ransom by a group of gangsters working for Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli), Bangladesh's most ruthless drug kingpin, and brought to the capital city of Dhaka. As Ovi's father is currently in prison, he is unable to properly pay the ransom and time is running out over whether or not Ovi will be brought home in one piece. To ensure Ovi's safe return, former soldier and black market mercenary Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is recruited to travel to Dhaka to extract Ovi from his kidnappers and navigate through the dangerous city with Amir's gang and corrupt police officers hot on their tails.While this genre isn't anything new, Extraction still proves that with the right amount of creative action and star power, there is still some entertainment value to be had. The story follows the typical plot line of an important individual being kidnapped and a tough macho protagonist attempting to rescue said individual. Cliched and silly? Yes, but if that's what you enjoy, then this is for you. The strong violence and gore will certainly be off-putting to casual audiences, but for the most part I think it looked stylised in the vein of the graphic novel from which it was based. With that said, some of it did feel excessive at times and served little purpose other than for sensationalistic action scenes involving the two main characters. In terms of the screenplay, some it felt confusing near the beginning as it didn't do that good of a job establishing the differences between the Indian and Bangladeshi characters to the viewer. We are shown that there is something of a rivalry amidst the two countries involving their drug empires but it isn't really communicated that clearly how severe it is over the course of the film. Also, we see how some of the police forces in each country are in cahoots with the drug lords as they have been bribed to work in their favour but they only really show up in one or two scenes and aren't ever mentioned again. This felt like a missed opportunity to offer a commentary on police corruption but instead it was brushed aside for some more action.Stunt coordinator Sam Hargrave, making his directorial debut, showcases his talents for cleverly choreographed fight scenes and single take shots that keep the viewer on edge. There were parts where I was reminded of some the action-packed moments depicted in the John Wick films, in that the lead character made good use of the surrounding environment to take out his adversaries, even using simple everyday objects as weapons. He also shows how claustrophobic the densely populated cities of India and Bangladesh can be when trying to maneuver through the large number of people to get to where one is going, especially if you're being pursued by dangerous gang members. I still think he has a long way to go before he can be taken seriously as a storyteller, but he has certainly nailed the action and cinematography side of things.Chris Hemsworth plays his usual badass action hero self, shooting, stabbing and punching his way through a seemingly endless number of foes. At this point, it's pretty much confirmed that this is the only type of role he is capable of playing but still, if it ain't broke. I particularly liked his scenes with the young Ovi Jr and how he becomes something of a father figure to him throughout the course of film. There is a nice back and forth dynamic between the two, clearly reflecting on Hemsworth's personal love of India and its people. Unfortunately his interactions with the rest of the cast felt lacking, save for a scene or two with David Harbour, who plays an old army acquaintance of his. These were the only parts of the film that offer some kind of emotional connection with the audience, as the rest is merely bullets flying and things being blown up.As I mentioned earlier, this film offers nothing new from the kidnap and rescue genre but a great deal of its appeal comes from the action rather than the story. Reportedly, there is a sequel in development and although I don't really see this whole thing becoming a franchise, I think it does provide an opportunity for further world building and the ironing out of some this film's issues. If you have nothing better to watch on Netflix, then there's not much else to say but sit back and enjoy this for what it is.I rate it 6.5/10","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Throughout the whole movie, I always felt that he was going to change. How about the thunderhammer? Why hasn't it come? Hahaha, this may be a common problem for actors to fix their roles. It's like I'm used to watching wolf uncle's singing and dancing plays. I think wolf uncle's paw can't be drawn to an actress. Mr. tonestak is even more deeply rooted. Apart from Sherlock Holmes, any movie he sees is full of the feeling that he is pretending that he will come back with a click of his watch. In fact, this feeling has a great impact on the experience of watching movies. What do you think about Harry Potter when you watch the escape from Billy toria the other day? Where's the magic wand? Say the mantra. It's too far away from the topic. Continue to talk about this amazing rescue. First of all, the actors are very good. Other actors don't pay much attention to it, because brother hammer is enough. He is handsome enough. The action scene is also very exciting. The same halo of the protagonist is also very obvious. Although he died in the end, in fact, several rockets sealed the bridge and finished. Why bother? But since it's the fans who are basically fluent in the plot, it's fair to say that they can justify themselves. The editing is reasonable and not controversial. The only problem is the setting of the young man. It's a bit like Taiwan's master of success, the chicken soup is too full to swallow.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Action sequences were already his forte; but he absolutely nails the rare emotional bits as well.The second half gets a little boring because of the lack of a proper storyline; there's only so much shooting and killing you can take before it becomes an element of gore.

I saw the advertisement for this movie and said it might be vulgar. You have seen many great action scenes with many explosions, guns and pursuits. Yes, it is a strong movie in terms of performance.The world surrounding the movie is a poor, cruel, and frightening world that was shown. You see most of the scenes of the film were filmed in the slums of Bangladesh, and some in certain areas in India. It was depicted as a gloomy world with a lot of crime and corruption. The director manages to bring out this world shockingly.Director Sam Hargrave has a background in action and law, and I have seen similar films directed in this way. The director understands action scenes and knows how to build a powerful moment and hold the viewer's breath in it.There are some scenes that contributed to the decrease in the evaluation of people. I wanted to explain or explain more about some situations, so that the people's actions would be more logical to the viewer. There were many scenes that were not deep, and some scenes that contained poor and superficial effects and devoid of depth of meanings, such as the movement of smoke.Chris Hemsworth is an action star, an actual action hero, a powerful action hero, and he carried the film on his shoulders, but he did as the director told him. The director didn't want to expand the deep action scenes. I do not deny that if the shots or the frame were wider and deeper than this, if the cameras used in filming the scenes were farther away, or their movement or vibration while filming the scenes were less than this, these scenes would have become clearer and more impressive.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The whole as a whole is well made, they did a great job managing to explain the struggle between two sides as the hostage is thrown in the middle.Personally I enjoy how Extraction tackled the concept of family being caught up in intense drug sought warfare. Children are always in an exposed area adidst all of the violence and they always deserve the ability to choose. Chris Hemsworth even as a hardened Mercenary managed to share his personal sympathy and feelings with the distraught children.Great movie.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Action scenes are well choreographed though violent. But the story is nothing new, scenes are predictable and lacks logic. For example, a dreaded don is very easily killed in a bathroom. Randeep hooda's double crossing is also not convincing. But if these things don't bother you, then you can enjoy extraction as a timepass film.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A Good Action Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7657026/?ref_=tt_urv","alindsayal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv","18 December 2021","With new movies few and far between at the moment we have to take them when we get them and there is a new film from Netflix starring Chris Hemsworth called Extraction and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a special agent sent into Bangledesh to rescue a gangsters son from his rival.Main Character
As mentioned above Chris Hemsworth is the main character in this film and he does a really good job. He is great in the action scenes, he is believable and is probably only second to John Wick in terms of his action skills, it is just really entertaining to see him go through multiple enemies and kill them in pretty gruesome ways. His character takes some time to be developed but he has enough depth to him to make you care and you do understand his motivations towards the end of the film.Supporting Characters
David Harbour is probably the most recognisable supporting actor and he does a good job with the limited screen time he has, I bought into his character and Hemsworth's having a relationship and it worked. There is also a character called Saju who is hunting Hemsworth and he is like a Terminator in the action scenes taking down everybody in his path and he has a bit of character depth aswell. Unfortunatley though I didn't care about the boy as much as you are clearly meant to and I thought the villain of the film was incredibly basic and really had nothing interesting about him.Story
The best parts of the story are some of the arcs that the characters have, they develop nicely and you understand their motivations, I also thought the ending of the film was well done and left you guessing as to what could come next. Though as you can probably tell from the premise this film has a very basic plot and one that you have seen plenty of times and it does very little to make you think you have seen anything new.Script
The script has some heartful moments to it and some well done dramatic moments but it doesn't have anything that reall stands out to it. Plus a film like this doesn't really have any humour which may have been better at times to help humanise Hemsworth and other characters.Style
The style of the film is awesome, the action scenes are pretty incredible. They are really well filmed and well choreographed, every hit feels brutal and seeing the inventive ways that people are killed is a joy to see. As mentioned it can be a bit gruesome but I thought it worked for the film an allowed them to be more creative, also it was nice to see Bangledesh used as the backdrop as it provided some unique action sequences.Overall
Overall, this is a good action film, if you want to see Hemsworth take out tonnes of guys then this is a film for you, it doesn't do anything to stand out too much but is an enjoyable film for sure.Rating - 7/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Growing up in 1980s & the 1990s we were fed with a high dose of action movie offerings from Hollywood on a weekly basis and by the end of the first decade of this century almost all action movies had become very boring as it all revolves around the same plot, boring bad guys, trigger happy shooters, stale car chases, stuff blowing up everywhere and illogical storytelling.
But Extraction though it involves a very tried and tested plot and the the same characters played again for the zillionth time, the making is absolutely next generation stuff. Photography and stunt scenes were outstanding along with the story moves on a breathtaking speed. Some characters though a little exaggerated, were enjoyable. Chris Hemsworth did an excellent job in the high octane action scenes. Forget Logical loopholes in the story line and just watch it for its action sequences which is really outstanding. The makers I believe have taken a great amount of pain to not repeat stuff we have been seeing all these years and the result is refreshing. This one is a gem for the action fans out there.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Another highlight is the extended tracking shot during the movie's strongest and most violent sequence. I'm not sure if it's the best tracking shot ever in an action movie, but it very well may be the longest.If you enjoy action movies, you'll probably enjoy this one. It's perfectly adequate.","14 out of 25 found this helpful.

A few minutes into a 13 minute one-shot action scene, my reaction was ""Man, this scene is fantastic"" -- and then -- ""Damn, this must have been crazy-hard to do.""While it literally ""sweats"" from the effort by the film crew and stars, it is in no way perfect. Plot is nearly non-existent and things get repetitive as the movie progresses.But if you like your action intense, you'll enjoy this a lot.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

So let me get a few points out of the way...1. If you like John Wick or have played Doom before and really like the game, you will love this movie.If you are that kinda person who likes non stop executions, gore, violence and do not really care about the logic and practical scenarios... oh boy you are in for another treat. It's just like any other fast and furious movie out there, does not make sense but does a really great job in giving you the non stop crisp untouchable hero action. Just as I said, if you love Doom, you'll love this.
Because Chris Hemsworth has done it again ladies and gentleman. A banger yet again. I wouldn't say a masterclass, but good.2. If you're that kinda guy who doesn't like being left hanging for dead in the end, JUST WALK AWAYNow, if you're that kinda person who wants to understand the complete plot, who doesn't really like thinking about the movie for weeks, analyzing every aspect of the movie to understand the ending? Like I said. JUST WALK AWAY.But hey, every movie is unique in it's own perspective. You gotta appreciate the efforts put in.3. If you're that person who likes to appreciate the bonding between the people, like to just flow through emotions, viewing the scenario through one's shoes, THIS IS JUST WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.If you're the person who really binds with the characters on the screen, really like empathizing, go ahead. Extraction does a good job in portraying the different walks of life.Now coming to my review:Why 7/10? Here it goes ..1. As you guessed it, Chris carried the whole movie. The others characters were really bland. It felt artificial and I felt the scripted dialogues even before my brain could decipher it.2. Most of the plot is predictable. And again, it's the same amateur mistakes again.The trailer revealed the entire movie's plot. Very poor decisions made by the team. There is nothing special to the plot, it's just raw. And RAW as in Gordon Ramsey's verses.3. The sound effects was very average. The sounds of the guns firing, the police sirens, the nades, the smokes, the frags, everything seemed out of place. Visuals were fine, the soundtracks were fine, yeah, Just about does it guess.So all in all, it's just a one timer, nothing too special to watch it over and over again unless you're a die hard fan. I would say this movie is alright.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Movie have everything in it just like a Hollywood Power-packed action. Pankaj Sir don't have much screen space but his acting is enough to fill the requirements.
Chris is good but somewhere it looks like P.U.B.G for real (just kidding) but I felt that for a second.
I like it. I'm Missing Movie Theaters very badly but it's ok to be safe then sick. So enjoy your lockdown with (Out of the Fire) oops i mean Extraction. Blink.

That pretty much tells you all you need to know about Australian mercenary Tyler Rake - yes, that's his name - other than that he's clearly struggling with private grief and numbs his physical and emotional pain with copious amounts of OxyContin.

The reasoning of which really isn't all that important, in fact, it is a designed adversity that he is trying to save a kid's life. Without even watching the movie, I could have told you it wasn't worth killing so many people to rescue one kid.The action is excellent and worth watching the rest of the movie: hell, you could even fast forward through the parts where they're not fighting.

He still manages to ratchet up a triple digit bodycount to save a drug lord's son. How ungodly of him.The plot is as simple as it gets- India's biggest drug lord's son gets kidnapped for ransom by Bangladesh's biggest drug lord, and the former enlists Hemsworth's group of mercenaries for the rescue. Of course, the obstacles start piling up, and Thor summons up all the thunder he can to save the innocent.Neflix may have thought a movie set in Bangladesh offers novelty, but their treatment is so formulaic, that you replace Bangladesh with any other 3rd world country setting, the movie would virtually remain the same. The 10 year old child soldiers, machete waving teenagers, corrupt police forces and simply high gangsters could fit in anything set in Mexico, Africa or Burma. There is absolutely no attempt to develop the precious few characters in the movie, including the leads.Seems Chris Hemsworth is saving his laughs for Marvel only. Here he plays Tyler Rake- a mercenary with a heart of gold and lot of bullets- you know the kind of characters Arnold used to play back in the 80s. Regular Netflix stalwarts Pankaj Tripathi, Neha Mahajan and David Harbour play side characters, but the one man that really makes every scene count is a buffed up Randeep Hooda. He stands toe to toe against Hemsworth in the action sequences, and gets a poignant send-off too. Rest of the cast are caricatures of the highest order.Irrespective of the genericity of the plot, Extraction is probably one of Netflix's most well-choreographed action movie. and why not- given that director Sam Hargreaves has been the stunts director in a host of Marvel movies. Mind you, this is no Chad Stahelski, or Gareth Edwards stuff. Hargreaves trades off Chad's style, and Gareth's art for effective brute. It is a cocktail of everything you see in action movies- manic car chases, exploding helicopters, sniper fire, close quarter gunfights, and car crashes, and from a first time film-maker, really impressive at that.Am sure he will only get better- and learn to nuance his characters a bit more, and make his movies a bit less predictable.But the two things that make up my price of my time cost of viewing are the epic Thor vs Hellboy fight (can you do that, Marvel?) and making Hemsworth speak Bengali 😊Indian don vs Bangladeshi don really? Whom did you think will win?
Extraction- playing on your phone.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Thank God Netflix broke away from their 'Woke' nightmares long enough to produce this.
This is truly the best Action film Chris Hemsworth has done to date, bar none, and he excelled at making it work, and work hard making it.
Chris, you HAVE TO Do More of these !
The entire cast is put thru their paces to get that 'cut-above' result.
Sam Hargrave Crafts this thing together incredibly.
It'll make you dizzy at some parts. You have to see ot to believe it.
And for those of you who criticize the lack of character development, remember who made this thing,
the Russo's,
whom are the masters of leaving you with 2 things,
-More questions than answers,
and,
-Wanting for More.
Hoping there is a sequel.

I find it unbelievable and morally unacceptable that the life of an innocent child is in any case more important than the life of the hundreds of policemen and military who died in this movie. They are not gang members.
Anyone in these countries know that the average police officer or soldier is (also) a father who just wants to provide for his family. An innocent person who has absolutely nothing to do with the corruption of higher ranks.
Therefore, I couldn't be fully emotionally committed to this movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Chris Hemsworth was superb as always. I also liked the part of Randeep Hooda.But, attention to details were way off the track. The whole set looks nothing like Dhaka except for few drone shots. I wouldn't mind if the plot wasn't revolved around Dhaka. The whole story was about rescuing a boy from a gangster based in Dhaka. So the movie should've felt like it's happening in Dhaka. The Bengali accent was inaccurate, the accent used in this movie is from West Bengal, India not from Bangladesh. Child terrorism was never a thing in Bangladesh but the movie clearly emphasized on it. The roads, police, vehicles, locations, buildings, and even the commonly used Bengali fonts on banners and posters are from West Bengal. So this is not nearly an accurate depiction of Dhaka. A slight mismatch would be considerable but this is completely messed up!However, only the people from Bangladesh will feel this way. Everyone else will love this movie. I complained about those things because we have better expectation from big movie industries when it comes to attention to details. And Extraction missed the big picture, details come way later.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's brutal, well coordinated, tense, and exciting. There is an entire action scene where it's basically one take with hidden cuts and it is incredible. More stuntmen need to direct movies because lots of movies fail at interesting action. However, the sacrifice really takes this movie down. The story and characters are so generic that any scene that isn't action is downright annoying. For some reason they spoil part of the end of the movie in the beginning even though it didn't add anything to show it in the beginning. And speaking of the end, the action started to become stale by the 3rd act and it felt a lot more like just walk shoot, walk shoot, walk shoot, and it was hard to fear for any of the characters because they are so basic. Overall, there is probably a solid 30-40 minutes of excellent action, a mediocre 30 minute finale, and 40 minutes of a generic story and characters. I feel this theme is very common in the Netflix original action movies such as Den of Thieves and I hope the sequel to Extraction is better.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

In one-liner ""it's good for action lover and worth watching but can be spared"". It remains a one-man show from beginning to end. What I noticed a tactical plan of rescue is missed, insignificant sequences which are not must.Plot Overview:The movie revolves around the kidnapping of boy(Ovi), an Indian drug lord's son and how he is extracted from Bangladesh by Tyler (Chris Hemsworth). Most of the scenes are filmed into crowded streets of Dhaka and comes out natural throughout the movie.Action:The action sequence is good and shot beautifully, don't know the technology but it feels you are in a game. Chase scenes are eye-catching, especially the tussle between Chris and Randip Hooda is a treat to watch. Both Chris and Randip did justice to their roles and executed actions perfectly and it seems real. However, some scenes from the army look incompetent, how come a country which is kept under complete lockdown not able to hunt a single person. Personally, I can't believe.Performance:Main screen time is taken by Chris and Randip, both did justice and acted in the character. Rudraksh portrayed the son's role elegantly. The Indian drug lord played by Pankaj Tripati but he hardly got 2 minutes on screen and Priyanshu Painyuli, Bangladesh's drug lord make a significant impact but he also doesn't have anything to do.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The plot is good enough and the picture is excellent. Chris Hemsworth does a good job portraying the vulnerable but brutal action hero. The only thing that at times broke the immersion a tiny bit for me is when the movie didn't know if it wanted to be realistic or not. The (by the way stunning) female lead looked far too glamourous in combat and Chris was too superhuman at times when you consider the (relatively) realistic setting. So maybe the sequel needs to be more realistic or more over the top.

They almost replicated the entire Old Town perfectly in Ahmedabad, India. However, I personally didn't like the Bangla dialogues used in the movie, seemed very weak. And the Bengali accent used in the movie was West Bengal's one, would have been much more better if they replicated Old Dhaka or atleast Bangladesh's Bangla accent properly. The Indian cast was a bit weak in the acting part, but they tried. The story lacked details of the timeline and many other things too. Loved the action scenes. Enjoyed the movie, I would recommend you to watch it, but Dhaka looks much more gorgeous in real life. Chris Hemsworth was a treat to watch.

Story-wise , extraction is hollow, shallow movie but hey , same as for example predator or john wick , but those movies have some soul and created cult. Extraction is dumb, sweaty , gipsy but very good in execution.. I dont like Hemsworth , because he is not actor, he is movie model for audience, precious Russo brothers asset generating money.
Extraction is very good if you want lazy movie and if you want to compare this flick to John wick or john wick 3 (i admit john wick 2 is inferior).
You dont get bored, but you will be annoyed how cliche-esque the main character is. At least , again, if youre normal , adult human, not avengers empty fan.
Actions scenes are good, well, not good, fantastic, and comparison with John Wick is in place but somehow extraction offers another angle, technically and with sorroundings.
Plot is really hundred times recycled material with one big logical whole and with very annoying - liberal-esque ending where director and Russo brothers AGAIN are scared to make THEIR OWN decision but instead they again wanted to satisfy 100% of the audience, not 25 or 50.
I recommend only if you want to see technically great movie with perfect action scenes.. nothing more.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But due to less runtime, superb direction and screenplay it is worth a watch. During some action sequences it looks really intense and made us felt our presence as third person view following the actor which get on the nerves.
I would say don't judge the movie coz it misrepresent Dhaka. Yes we South Asian understands how Dhaka/ Bangladesh or India looks but we need to grow up. The movies are an art of fiction. We dont judge other hollywood movies misrepresenting countries we don't live, so why this. Let us see beyond that and enjoy this action sequence. No need to spread hate and force bad ratings.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I think if the director would have approached an actor from Bangla Film Industry like Jishu Sengupta it would have been a splendid thing to watch. Priyanshu as an actor is good but imagine a Bangladeshi gangster speaking Bangla in a Hindi accent. That was too terrible for me to digest. Anyways the other parts were outstanding.

Look-like this will be cake walk for Sam as all big credentials are involved in this Netflix project. However he failed to keep the momentum in this action thriller.Performance: Chris Hemsworth(Thor) gave solid performance as action hero and emotional father. Randeep Hooda was surprisingly brilliant in his first full fledged Hollywood outing. Rudhraksh Jaiwal was also good in touch. Golshifteh Farahani was looking stunting. Good supporting role played by Priyanshu Painyuli.Script and Screenplay: This is the weakest point of this major project. There was nothing new offered by Russo brothers who directed magnum opus Avengers: End Game. They have placed one suspense which was quite obvious and it exposed quite early. When movie based on Indian backdrop, naming convention of father- son should not be western e.g. Ovi Mahajan.Action Sequences: Definitely this department will gave you some goose bumps. All action sequences were world class especially Chris and Randeep's 11 min long action sequence.Last words: If you can understand Bengali, you will enjoy it more.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Furthermore, Chris Hemsworth may be a no-brainer choice to play an action hero, but in here we can see he is a human who gets busted and injured. There is not much of a plot: hero extracts boy but things get messed up so he has to do the utmost to achieve his mission. That is the premise. But this mission also provides a character arc for Hemsworth's character, and in the middle of the story, he makes a choice. The real highlight of the movie is the action, of course. This movie pulls no punches with the action, there is a slight humor to it involving child soldiers too. I am surprised with the acting from the supporting cast. Randeep Hooda plays one of Hemsworths' nemesis in the beginning, and he is totally badass. I also rooted for his character. The style of shooting involves long shots, and immerses you in the story. The choreography is almost like John Wick, but in a more gritty setting. Thus, there are a lot of good things to enjoy from the movie. The weak point is the drama, and sometimes even the action drags down. The first part was great, but the action in the end was less exciting. But keep watching till the end anyway and you won't regret it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Randeep Hooda however was best performer through out the movie, his ruthlessness clearly shown on the screen, whenever he's on screen he take over the sequence.

As the title suggests, it's about a mercenary by the name of Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) carrying out the extraction of a little boy (apparently, the son of a drug lord in India) from the clutches of a Bangladeshi drug lord. Aiding him covertly in his mission is a team led by Nik (Golshifteh Farahani, who's best known for About Elly). A subplot brings Saju (Randeep Hooda), the Indian drug lord's enforcer, into the scenario. What ensues is a series of ultra-violent, well-crafted (and tastefully shot by Newton Thomas Sigel) action-movie clichés.Hargrave chooses to cover up the fallacies in the script, some inane casting choices (Priyanshu Painyuli, for example, is a particularly bad one), the lack of locational authenticity (most of the film is shot in India, not Bangladesh except for plateshots), and disjointed Bengali lines mouthed by the gangsters, with neatly choreographed action. One such set-piece (shot like it's a single take) that gets going shortly into the 35-minute mark, is probably the best I've seen in recent memory (which is why it gets a 3 and not a 2.5). The action is punctuated by bullets whizzing past narrow alleyways, hand-to-hand combat that we've seen done better in Asian films, and a sufficient amount of blood-spilling.Heck, in what seemed like a minor nod to The Raid films, Tyler uses a rake (which is also his surname, mentioned later in a scene) to dispose of a thug. The single-shot-set-piece is straight out of the books of ""Call of Duty"", with the camera splendidly juggling between first-person and third-person action. Even for a hardcore action flick, Joe Russo writes in a few scenes that attempt to humanize the characters of Tyler and Saju. They aren't exactly acting showcases, but they get the job done. Plus, the presence of Randeep Hooda subverts the 'white savior' cliché to a certain extent.While the scenes involving the Bangladeshi drug lord (dressed in awkward costumes) were the weakest (in terms of writing and performances), I did like how Hargrave portrayed the plight of underprivileged kids in the Indian subcontinent and how they were being used as gun-wielding henchmen. It's a template action movie alright, but there's enough machismo, explosions, and gore to please fans of the genre. It, however, needed better writing, a (much better) baddie, and more heart, to rise above its surface-level coolth.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie has some well-choreographed action sequences, good background score, and brilliant camera work. Though I think they could've avoided playing Bollywood songs in every other corner of the apartment building action sequence, that too in Bangladesh. It felt like a bad attempt to attract Indian audiences.The movie seemed to lack character development and plot development. It just focused on the action sequences which were brilliant and made you feel like you're watching a good shooting game. The film gets somewhat repetitive towards the end. You can only watch so many people getting shot without turning out to be numb and somewhat exhausted by it. Also, the film opens with a shot from close to the end of the film and It doesn't work however because there is no intrigue behind it. This was one of the few poor choices for an otherwise good action film. I would recommend giving this one a watch especially if you like action movies and games.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This uncut scene also takes the action scenes of extraction to a new height, and you want to see it again and again.The story goes like this that Mahajan's son Ovi, the mafia leader of India, takes his rival Ovi to Bangladesh.Tyler Rake reaches Dhaka to remove this child from the clutches of criminals and lays a pile of corpses.This is what starts with guns, helicopters, trains, and human explosions that last.The film lacks emotion. The film could have been even better if the emotional track had been better in the movie, but those who could not evoke emotions while writing the Russo script. However, there is a lot of action.The story of the film is not that fun, but its action makes it worth watching.In terms of acting, the film is a film by Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda. Both of them have given each other a competition; they have also done a collision.But both the characters are weak, just because of the script of the film. Rudraksha's acting is excellent.Priyanshu Painyuli has become the mafia leader of Bangladesh. His acting is the best, but his character is written so poorly that he does not do anything.Pankaj Tripathi's screen space is also limited to just one scene in jail. Golshifat Farhani, David Harbor, and Chris Jai Alex come for a little bit of fear.From this film, you have high hopes for action, as it is directed by Sam Hargrave, who has been the stunt director of films like 'Captain America: Civil War,' 'Avengers: Endgame.'Hargrave's direction style favors close-range clash and bust-up. He weaves in and around the action with Wild Fluid hand-held cameras, increasing speed and creating a feeling of being caught amid hyper-violent going-on to the viewer.If you leave the story and if you focus only on the action, then this film should not be missed because such action films will not come again and again.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Actually I hadn't even heard about ""Extraction"" before my friend spoke to me about it. But then again, I am not an avid fan of Chris Hemsworth, so I suppose that is why.But as my friend praised the movie highly, I must admit that I was having a certain amount of expectations for this movie from director Sam Hargrave. And I will say that writer Joe Russo actually managed to churn out a rather entertaining action plot.Sure, the storyline was rather simplistic actually, bordering on being near non-existing. But the sheer amount of action sequences and the dynamic way that the movie was shot more than made up for the lack of a deeper and profound storyline. I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed the way the movie was shot, making it feel like I was right there in the action. Some accomplishment from the cinematography people here.""Extraction"" is not a movie that relies heavily on a sound storyline, as it is all the action that does the talking. So having an excessive character gallery and good dialogue wasn't in the drivers seat here. But again, the action made up for those shortcomings.If you enjoy action movies, then you should definitely sit down to watch ""Extraction"", as it was an adrenaline-filled movie from start to end. However, this is hardly a movie that warrants more than just a single viewing, as the contents of the story just doesn't have the contents for that.I am rating ""Extraction"" a solid six out of ten stars.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Really? That's how drug dealers work? Using legitimate assets and banks? What about the warehouse full of cash lying around as always shown in the movies?
And why would a drug dealer kidnap the BROKEN opponent's kid? Where is the ground for the kidnapping? Or just for fun? How the kid is transported from Mumbai to Dhaka? Using a chartered plane or ship or by road or how?Pankaj Tripathi played an Indian Drug Dealer. Using him for less than 5 mins seems an insult for the actor's caliber as he's an astonishing actor and known for playing a cool headed bad guy in Indian film & television industry. He could have been of much use as either opponent or a strong character in the movie.
(the_rajasthani_Wanderer)
Which role did Randeep Hooda play? Is he a partner with the kid's father or security or something else. In case he played a security officer's character then the writer must have been drunk while writing his character. The only introduction to the character's abilities are from a photograph dressed as army personnel, no other description.But, Randeep gets full attention in his weak role also, even if he attacks Rake after rescuing the kid from goons.
If his character ""Saju"" is so brave, intelligent, can travel to Dhaka and fight a bunch of mercenaries then why didn't he thought of rescuing the kid instead of hiring Rake as mercenary when he knew there is no money to pay him. His involvement with the rescue would have been known to the opponent anyway.What about the opponent Bangladeshi drug dealer? What's his contribution to the film other than wearing nice suits, sitting around, speaking nonsense and sipping drinks? And he illegally ties up with a Colonel from Bangladesh Army? Man, it gets worst and worst towards the end.Golshifteh Farahani's character, Nik Khan, handles the team but no tactical experience or decision making in critical situations. The only memorable is her expressionless face.Chris Hemsworth justified his character elegantly and played it very well but details about the character are so vague that I failed to grasp character's motives till the end. The stunts are nicely coordinated and stimulates goosebumps while watching. But, his friend who owes Rake his life, betrays and tries to kill him. Pity on the character for having such a friend.I've seen many Hollywood movies but the lowest grade director from Hollywood may have a better shot of getting nice reviews than Extraction's director.Seems, the film is a waste of talented actors like Chris Hemsworth, Pankaj Tripathi, Randeep Hooda and many others.It could have been a great movie by Chris Hemsworth as a producer.
But, the screenplay writers and the director killed the film with lack of knowledge about South Asian cultures, Geography and people's behaviour.

Second, set design was not up to the mark.
Third, Bangladesh is not that yellowish which was shown. Should've researched a bit more.Other than that, action was not that good and not that bad too (maybe my expectations level was too high). Enjoyed hand to hand combat though. In the end all i want to say is that i hoped for a bit more....","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Be prepared for about 85 minutes of fast-paced action sequences with brutal bloody shootouts, melee fights and a huge amount of dead people.PRO:
I loved how they handled the camera angles, it feels like you can feel the action in front of you, not just watching a movie.Hemsworth did a great job here. I could accept him as a merciless mercenary, because he has nothing to loose in this plot and you can feel it, in every fight.You love to see a unstoppable guy fighting a complete army like ""Taken, Rambo, John Wick, The Equalizer, Crank and all that stuff? Give this movie a chance ;) You will like it!
CONTRA:
Way too much CGIThere are almost no highlights. Most of the time its like a Ego-Shooter campaign with no real storyline beside ""save the hostage"". Yes it's entertaining but i would not watch it a for a second time.Boring plot
Have a great day!Cheers,
Fletcher","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

There is no sense. Like I had just wasted my 2 pretty valuable hours of life by watching this movie. Yes, a life of a kid is important but the life of other people is also important I guess. But the director or the writer does not aware of this fact I guess. In the movie, tons of life has been blown like crackers. They must have been dreaming while making this movie cause who kills a couple of thousands of people to just save the life of a kid. You can think that I kinda rude but think about it properly. if the kid is captured by a terrorist group and there is no state's authority to do anything then somehow it is understandable. But no what we see the movie that a bunch of druglords pets capture that kid. ok so extract him from there. But no our mighty hero has gone too far. He just started a war with the state. Like he kills police and RAB and army personals just like a piece of cake.
I have never seen this kind of stuff before like a war against the state by a hitman who works by a darknet hitman agency.And this is not Bangladesh. There is no such drug lord in Bangladesh at all. And Yes many of our policemen are corrupted, sometimes they don't do their duty properly and sometimes they exercise the power beyond their jurisdiction. But when it comes to the safety of the people of Bangladesh, they act solid. They don't have all the types of equipment that they need. but when a situation arises, they are the most efficient force in this world. Believe it or not, they are.

This was by far one of the best action movies I've seen in a very long time.
Of course, what could go wrong when Chris Hemsworth is on the scene. Chris simply nailed it, and not to forget the young Indian actor Rudhraksh Jaiswal and the more experienced actor Randeep Hooda who both did not fail to deliver.
The end was really emotional and brought me down in tears.
Overall amazing performance by all and every single moment of the movie was intense and I did not feel board or fall asleep even once.
I would have given it a 10/10 if only all the action scenes were realistic, but of course it's only a movie so you would have to expect at least a few out of the ordinary scenes. LoL","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Lots of mindless action, and strong performances by Hemsworth and the Indian dude who's name I won't pretend to know by Googling it just for this review. Nothing to complain about too much. Not a masterpiece, but vastly better than the majority of Netflix Originals I've seen so far (6 Underground, Spenser Confidential and Red Notice come to mind as sub-mediocre). Some of the Netflix Original Series are pretty strong, like Stranger Things, Daredevil and Punisher, but their films just seem to fall short more often than not, so this was a welcome change. Extraction 2 supposedly on the way, I wouldn't expect it to be much different. A film like this is absolutely nothing compared to films like First Blood or Sicario. I would really like to see Netflix finally rise above routine mediocrity with their original big-name films.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

With cinemas locked down due to the global pandemic, I had stopped waiting to watch any new movies. What caught my attention was the trailer of Extraction, that finally gave me hope to wait for a big action blockbuster. And having watched it on Netflix just minutes ago, I can assure you that it's the best action movie of the year till now. The film lived up to the hype and left me satisfied as the credits rolled.Extraction's USP is the action it offers: beautifully shot, neatly choreographed and well-edited too. Those fed up of quick cuts in recent action movies would be pleasantly surprised to find long takes in this film (in this case, a prolonged single-shot action sequence!) instead of fast cutting. The color tone is rich and suits the film's own tone. There are a couple of dramatic breaks between the action that make the viewers root for the characters.Chris Hemsworth delivers an impressive performance that gels with his character, while Rudraksh Jaiswal also presents us with a neat act. It's finally very satisfying to see Randeep Hooda doing a character like this. Make no mistake, he's done a couple of action films before but never did he play a tough character like this: one that allows him to both throw a punch and emote whenever needed.Extraction is also surprisingly realistic in terms of how it doesn't want to turn heroes into indestructible characters. When they get hit, they bleed. When they are injured, they feel pain. And given how all of this is done masterfully during its video-game style action, Extraction fulfills the action genre to its fullest. Again, since there's no way one's gonna step out and pay to buy tickets and popcorn to a movie at this moment, it's better to stay home, grab some snacks and prepare yourself for a thrill-a-minute, no-nonsense action ride called Extraction. Action aficionados are definitely in for a massive treat.","18 out of 46 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Well done third person shooter videogame adaptation (with lots of borrowed stuff)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5672140/?ref_=tt_urv","kuarinofu","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23858655/?ref_=tt_urv","24 April 2020","Extraction is a lot to talk about.One should watch this film with an understanding that this is yet another film directed by a stunt coordinator, much like John Wick. So, there is not much to be expected in terms of story or characters.With this in mind, we encounter our first problem - Chris Hemsworth is very much miscast for the role. He looks ripped and all cool, he can do stunts, but he is too typecast as a good guy superhero to represent a generic washed up mercenary with no will to live. Also, and this is my personal humble opinion, he is not a good dramatic actor.This is where we find our third problem - the story is incredibly generic and unimaginative. You can easily spell out the dialogue before the characters do, just because you've heard it a million times.The film is a remarkably interesting combination of stunt ideas and cool scenes, mixed with inspirations and copypastas from other films, even the ones the director and the writer worked on together.What sucks is that all of these feel watered down, not even one of these borrows really works out in the end. The emotional connection base of a hired assassin and a kid who has no real family (for the assassin to become one for him) could not be done better than in Leon (1994) (or the Professional). The crime mogul intent on training a heir to replace him in time was also done before (but I can't recall now when and where), but in this film this plot goes absolutely nowhere, it just stops (while it could've been something interesting). The ending was also very reminiscent of the ending of Leon btw. The old friend subplot was super obvious, but it still felt like it was borrowed from 16 Blocks (2006). Some of the visuals of the film were inspired by John Wick (2014), Children of Men (2006) (the car chase), the shooting style of the action was reminiscent of 1917 (2019), the ""drowning in the water"" scenes were ripped straight out of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) (interestingly enough, the director of Extraction was a stunt double for Chris Evans, even the music from these scenes was very similar because it was composed by the same composer.I can go on and on, but I think by now you get the point.Anyway, even well shot action scenes still need a script. They don't work without a good story, they just get tiresome and kinda boring, this was very well demonstrated by Michael Bay's 6 Underground (2019).There are lots of reviews of Bangladesh nationals who were offended by the portrayal of the country and the capital, but I'm not one of them (this is why filmmakers tend to use fictional locations).Besides the action scenes, I also loved that this film had that amateur quality to it, like lots of slow scenes that don't really go anywhere, but they just look smart.You also don't see Hellboy brawl with Thor very often, not even talking about Thor kicking and punching kids around.Interesting film in terms of how much they've put into it, still feels like a third person shooter video game with bosses and enemy respawns. Clearly not the worst of the stunt-directed kind.Easy watch if you're bored, but don't forget to disable your brain first.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

He should do more action movies!!The boy's acting was pretty good to. He gives an emotional tone for the whole movie.There is some plot holes in the movie but the action overcomes it.

However, the relentless action sequences might give you a migraine. They are well done, but the acting in the film is left to the professionals; that would be the Indian actors. The lead actor, unfortunately, has less range than John Wayne, and I think we all know what that means. The direction and production values make up for this deficiency, and the Indian character actors actually steal the film quite easily.
Think of the action sequences as eye candy and the main course of steak and potatoes is being done by the Indian actors. The street urchins of this Indian city were quite reminiscent of City of God, where orphans run rampant in Rio, Brail.
This aint your flying down to Rio film of the 30s. And Extraction isnt your usual overcoming bad odds battle; it is a bit unrealistic to think one man (even with the help of a highly trained team) can overcome an entire city of police and soldiers. That being said, the film is still very entertaining; thanks to the Indian actors.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The plot is simple; the action relentless. A Mumbai drug-lord's son is kidnapped and it's up to mercenary Chris Hemsworth to get him back. Neither he nor the film hang around. As I've said, it's both violent and relentless; a non-stop catalogue of killings and mutilations, choreographed to bloody perfection by first-time director Sam Hargrave. Of course, there isn't a frame that's actually believable. This is a live-action video game, based on a graphic novel, brilliantly photographed by Newton Thomas Sigel in and around Dhaka and with enough good guys and bad guys killing each other relentlessly to keep it on the boil for two hours. Brains may be largely in short supply but there's certainly no shortage of brawn.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However Netflix always seems to fall short on the most important part of any film, the plot. Not that the concept isn't interesting but on execution, as with all Netflix films, there is more that could've been done.The films main failure for me was the CGI, it really took me out of the film at points, the main example when the truck flips and is engulfed in flame. The phyiscs simulation is off and the fire effects are lacking quality, also at other points in the film with smoke being used to signal where things are taking place, there is a blatant lack of blending with environment so it just sticks out against a very yellow colour palette.Not to say this film isn't enjoyable, there are some amusing moments where the film takes a step back from the seriousness it tries to convey and allows a chuckle here and there.I will conclude by saying there were also some cool camera transitions but something more couldve been done in the edit trying to hide some cuts as they were fairly blatant even on a first watch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Is it about representing Dhaka? How many of you ever left your Dhanmondi Banani and went to Puran Dhaka and shadar ghaat? The movie clearly says it's based on the gangs of puran Dhaka and I see them much nicely portraying that. Guess what? Puran Dhaka's slums are worst than the scenes of movie and gangs are scarier than what was shown. They showed our rivers brown where it's black lmao. Go have a look tomorrow. Atleast they showed cop cars and strong police defence which doesn't exist in Dhaka haha.Coming down to the sepia (yellow) effect, try going out to USA or NZ and then back to Dhaka and the yellow effect will make some sense to you. Dhaka is covered in haze throughout summer where the sun rays get blended to haze. We don't notice it as we live in Dhaka. The movie has exaggerated it, I agree. But that's what Hollywood does with Kenya, South Africa and any warm country.Coming to the movie, y'all mad as it was not loaded with multiple complex segments to drive your head crazy. It was simply, and much straight to the point like a Bollywood movie. I liked this little movie. The action was amazing, visuals were realistic and it was way emotional near the end.All up, a nice movie. Lets not ask them to portray our city as something it isn't lmao.

Expanding leading man Chris Hemsworth's range and announcing director Sam Hargrave as one of the best action directors currently working.As mentioned previously, Chris Hemsworth is an extremely capable and commanding action star bringing a towering physicality to the role and shining just as much in the quieter moments where his past comes back to haunt him. Rudhraksh Jaiswal is really good and the bond he forms with Hemsworth is surprisingly strong.Sam Hargrave's direction is masterful, the standout moment is the obviously the 12 minute one take which is so immersive and doesn't make it easy for itself, moving from speeding cars to rooftops and from them to bustling streets. The rest action is just as satisfying, every cut is in the right place and every punch/kick/gunshot has so much weight behind it.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

If its about Indian Drug Mafia's Lord you'll see an actual India with an Indian guy as Drug Lord communicating in Hindi, similarly when film goes to Bangladesh, you'll see real Bangladesh with Bangladeshi guy being Drug Lord there talking In Bengali. The film is the directorial debut of Sam Hargrave a Stuntman and Stunt coordinator known for choregraphing stunts in several Marvel Movies including Captain America: Civil War, Endgame, Thor: Ragnarok etc. which explains the fact that film is very mediocre in its storytelling and plot unfolding. In addition to that the film also never connects you emotionally during its emotional parts. Despite of that the film is a visual gem and gives you some visual experience as cinematography and Long action sequences are the strongest part of the movie which somehow despite of the flaws pulls this movie off to engage its audience. Talking about performances, Chris shines in all the action scenes as he should've and his presence is delightful to watch especially in cat and mouse sequences.However on the other hand Randeep Hooda looked little off colored may be due to the longer tiring action scenes for which he is not use to of, despite of the fact that he has fair amount of screen presence and is one of the leads which I definitely not expected. Tripathi as an Indian Drug Lord having just cameo appearance but he nailed it as he always does.
So if you're looking for some action then this movie is for you as you cannot skip this visual gem when it comes to action","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Extraction is centered on rescuing Ovi, the son of an Indian Druglord who has been kidnapped by a Bangladeshi Drug lord Amir Asif.
This movie predominantly shows the rivalry between the 2 drug lords.
Pankaj Tripathi has about a 30-second role in the film, where he is seen in a jail instructing Saju, his accomplice to rescue his son Ovi from Dhaka or risk his own son's life.
Now Saju has accepted this precarious task unwillingly to save his family but he knows it won't be easy to get Ovi back from Dhaka, it would be like one Man v/s a Country.
He knows someone who can help accomplish this task on his behalf, Tyler, a black market mercenary. Tyler easily accepts this task and sets out to accomplish this mission backed by his team member, Niz.
The film starts with the climax scene where Tyler is shot, making us wonder whether the movie would live up to the hype and expectation.
The moment Tyler reaches Dhaka, Bang Bang, the action starts, the hand to hand combats, Knife fights, guns, bazookas, bombs, helicopters, sniper. Tyler has all the firepower one man would ever need to fight a country.
There are some emotional moments in the movie. amid Ovi's rescue mission when he tries to look back at his life, he realizes his father treated him like a possession more than his son and in this process ends up knowing Tyler's story where he learns about his 6yr old son who is no more. There is a certain bond that develops between Ovi and Tyler.
The USP of this film is action, action and nothing but action and is so well directed that it is difficult to comprehend this is Sam Hargrave's directorial debut. Sam Hargrave is a stunt coordinator at Marvel Universe and it comes as no surprise that he strapped himself around the car with a camera and said action. The scenes between Tyler and Saju are a treat to watch. A scene where Tyler and Saju fall from the balcony straight on to the road and the way the camera follows them will keep the audience gasping for breath.All in all, this movie is a treat for action junkies, it will surprise you with stunts u would have never seen before, the fights look very real and is very fast paced.
Extraction is based on a book called Cuidad.
The film's working title was initially Dhaka but was changed to Out of the Fire and finally, the makers settled for Extraction.
The shooting took place in Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Thailand.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The neighborhoods of Bangladesh resembles with many areas of India and looking at some of the breathtaking action scenes I think this movie should provide a lesson to our bollywood film makers as to how to make a proper action movie in India. I am an Indian and seriously feel that in the name of 'action' thriller most of our film makers just fool us with monotonous action scenes which repeatedly involves humans and cars flying unprecedentedly high in the sky after an explosion or a punch of the actor who isn't even playing the role of any superhero. This movie had a top hollywood and bollywood celebrity (Helmsworth and Randeep Hooda) and both did their jobs perfectly well, this just proves that Indian actors aren't anyway less than the best of the world when given a good director.There were some shortcomings too, it had too much of violence and it didn't have a strong story and a plot to compliment such well shot action sequences and amazing cinematography, the story telling wasn't at it's best yet this movie seems to be the best action movie shot in South Asia.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Except perhaps with slightly less 'badass empowered female' action, which was refreshing. There is a lot of violence, but it still felt watered down. It could have been way darker and edgier, which would have been more realistic too, but the main character was held back by the script. Being too nice and always honorable to even the most vile creatures and getting nothing in return.

However, the plot of the film is very basic and remains one - dimentional throughout its duration but the film still manages to hold your attention quite well.
The story of the film revolves around the son of India's biggest drug dealer who has been abducted by the gang of the drug lord of Bangladesh as they are not on good terms. A mercenary named Tyler(@Chris Hemsworth) has been hired to safely bring him back home. Beside the basic plot, there is hardly anything which gives the depth or twist to the story. Also @JoeRusso's writing has some flaws as the film gives less space for character development. Film has some loose ends and a very outdated portrayal of Bangladesh by showing weak Military, inexpert Special Forces and child terrorism to justify action sequences.
The screenplay is full of hardcore & mindblowing action sequences and you can see lots of violence happening throughout the movie. The combat scenes are brilliantly choreographed and the climax sequence is a major takeaway.
@ChrisHemsworth is in his top form and delivers with such an ease. @RandeepHooda as Saju is equally good and it's a delight to watch him in a never seen before avatar performing such high octane action sequences and all other starcasts have also delivered decent performances.
Background music works well. The cinematography is amazing. The camera work, one-take-shots are seriously fantastic.
You can definitely give it a watch. Thankyou","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

India could have just been fine. I would have given it 10/10. But as a Bangladeshi native, I cannot but express my dissatisfaction about the way film makers gave less attention to the use of Bengali language in the film. Even the setting which was supposed to be Dhaka was not at all in Dhaka. There is no forest around Buriganga river that runs through Dhaka. The mistake was sticking like a sore thumb. The women, the people, the sign boards, the accents of Bangla slang were all wrong. It could have been an excellent work if they could do it properly. They were using Calcutta tongue not Dhakaia language.This is was so disappointing.All the 7 star is for my favorite actor Chris Hemsworth. I could have been proud for this movie as it was staged in Bangladesh. Only if it were a reality - they could have done it Gazipur district with lots of forest to play firepower.

Chris Hemsworth carried the entire movie on his shoulders and being the executive producer of the movie he had very little scope to go wrong and to that point, he hardly disappoints you throughout the movie. Between both his falls (his first scene and the last scene), he has given a power packed performance.
The kidnapped kid (Rudraksh Jaiswal) shared many scenes with Chris and he successfully managed to stand tall throughout the movie. But the movie does leave you wishing Randeep Huda's character was a bit better defined. Half of the time you will not be able to decide whether to root for him or not. Moreover, it was a sheer waste to give Pankaj Tripathi such less screen time. It would have been much better to cast him as the Bangladeshi drug lord. He would have made the extraction far more difficult than it seemed at the end.The kidnapped kid (Rudraksh Jaiswal) shared many scenes with Chris and he successfully managed to stand tall throughout the movie.

In fact, you should be grateful that in these difficult times it gives you a chance at a good time while you are locked inside your houses.A good effort at extraction, isn't it?","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's actually quite horrific at times. There are a long car chase scene that has some clever and interesting camerawork. There are bad guys everywhere. What seemed like an easy extraction suddenly becomes one man's fight for survival. See what happens when you explain the movie? It's absolutely swimming in cheap cliches and actionmovie tropes. But you just can't not like it. It's very competently made! The action scenen are mostly very good. Maybe even extremely good. Better than some of the current blockbusters. Movies like this show time and time again that more money does not make a better movie. The new Indiana Jones movie looked like a cartoon alot of the times.

The Netflix tag still doesn't quite instill confidence despite their recent successful hits, and the action genre is one rife with hit and miss entries. I've already read quite a bit of feedback on this movie, and I feel like there's one key point they're all missing; this is a mindless action movie. Judging it on the merits of being a deep, thought-provoking character study is unfair. However judging it on the merits of being a balls-to-the-wall action flick, there's actually a lot here to redeem itself and set it apart from other attempts.Okay, there isn't much plot to Extraction. The entire story is summarised in the movie's title. Hemsworth plays a mercenary; Tyler, who's sent to Bangladesh in order to extract a drug-lord's son from the possession of a rival drug-lord. The entire city goes on lockdown and Tyler has to fight his way through henchmen and a corrupt police force in order to get out. There's some nice twists here and there from changing allegiances, and a few points of foreshadowing and plot payoffs, but there's nothing that requires you to really wrap your brain around it, and honestly that's okay. This isn't Inception. Truth be told Extraction has a lot more plot (from the aforementioned allegiance switches and payoffs) than I expected, so I feel like calling it mindless is a little baseless.Another thing about Extraction that plays against the dull and plot-less complaints is the character work. Again this isn't a full-on character study, and the background development we do get is a little cliché, but it's way more than your average run-of-the-mill action flick usually gets to enjoy. Tyler is a broken man after the death of his son and the breakdown of his marriage. He spends his days getting drunk and doing death-defying feats for fun. He has no more love of life. He doesn't get into the job because he cares about the kid or anyone involved. He just wants his money. But being haunted by the death of his son ends up making him more sympathetic to the fate of this kid, and as the movie goes on, the money means less to him. He just wants to get this kid out safe and alive.But Tyler isn't the only one that enjoys a hefty amount of personality. The movie also makes a bit to explore other more fringe characters, the most notable of which is Saju, the kids keeper after his father was incarcerated. With assets frozen, he can't afford to pay the mercenaries what he owes, so he tries to finish the job himself, against them. We get a look into his family life and his motivations behind his actions, and sit with him in the downtimes between action sequences. He becomes as much the lead character as Tyler does, earning respect and sympathy from the audience. You end up really rooting for this guy even as him and Tyler sparr off. We also get a small glimpse into the world of the antagonist drug-lord, showing us how despicable he really is by casually killing kids without a care, and brainwashing those left over to work for him. Extraction is brutal to its kids, but it plays to Tyler's predisposition and creates a much tighter and meaningful narrative than many give it credit for.But Extraction isn't about its plot or its characters, even though I feel those aspects are being unfairly criticised. Extraction is an action movie, directed by an ex-stuntman, starring muscled action stars from across the globe. In fact on that last point I particularly liked the movie's dedication to casting people roughly from the same area their character is meant to be from (or I guess vice versa; rewriting characters to fit the actor's background). Tyler is Australian, David Harbour plays a grizzled American on foreign soil, Nik is played by Iranian actress Golshifteh Farahani, and while most the Bangladeshi characters are actually played by Indian actors, it's at least closer than most Hollywood casting. I particularly hope this opens up more Western opportunities for Randeep Hooda who played Saju, oozing charisma and cool without speaking a word, and effortlessly earning audience sympathies.But anyway, horrific tangent aside, Extraction is about its action sequences, and on that it certainly doesn't fail. This is another movie in the likes of John Wick and Atomic Blonde that prefers its action gritty and efficient. There's style here for sure, but it rarely breaks suspension of disbelief, and we see real consequences for all the hits these characters take. Tyler takes time bandaging his arm and putting it in a sling, Saju has to put his broken nose back into place, and David Harbour offers probably the most realistic reaction to being shot in the chest I've seen in a long time. There's no flying acrobatics, and no artistic flailing of limbs to make the choreography look pretty. It's brutal and efficient fighting, showing how exhausting it can all be. Ammo counts and reloading matters, getting punched in the face is different to being kicked in the gut, being run-over by a car hurts. And this is before mentioning the soon to be most-talked-about 12-minute long shot action scene that spans car chases, knife fights, gun fights, and apartment brawls, following multiple characters and different perspectives with seamless match-cuts to give the illusion of a neverending single shot.But the action isn't a complete winner, and there are reasons I'm apprehensive to label it as 'realistic'. Certain objects come out of nowhere for no reason just for excitement purposes, like high-speed cars heading down a dead-end. While there's no flying around, there are some cable stunts that are a little hard to swallow, like Tyler grabbing a kid by the leg and effortlessly throwing him into a car door. There's also a number of sniper moments that feel like they take too many liberties with how sniping works. Normally this would be pernickety even for me, but for a movie that wallows in it's accurate portrayal of gun fights, from injuries to the differentiation of sounds (pistols make more of a 'pah' sound, for instance), giving sniper superhuman abilities like seeing round corners and 100% accuracy just felt little lazy. In any other action movie I probably wouldn't have minded these slip-ups so much, but when the rest of it is all so tightly choreographed and mapped out, slipping up and breaking believability becomes so much more noticeable.In some regards, Extraction is just an average, run-of-the-mill action flick, and in others it's up there with some of the genre's modern greats. There are stakes, characters have emotional backbones even if they are a little cliché, there aren't any deeper themes, but the narrative is still tight and focussed, the action is more phenomenal than it is irksome, the cinematography is a little bland, the soundtrack can feel like a rip-off of better scores, but these kinds of motifs are iconic because they work so well. I find Extraction a hard one to judge because it feels greater than it has any right to be, while also hitting just shy of the mark. But generally I fall positive, so I give Extraction a respectable 7/10, and honestly I could see myself bumping it up with subsequent rewatches.

I wasn't and hence not disappointed. Most action films are based on the extraction of kidnapped family member or a precious item or heists of different types. Lovers of action films are going to love this film. The 10 year old son of an Indian drug lord ( Pankaj Tripathi) is kidnapped by a drug lord of Bangladesh, and taken there. Pankaj tells the boy's caretaker Randeep Huda to get the boy back or else.... On the other hand, a mercenary Chris Hemsworth is launched for a rescue mission keeping in mind the ransom money. The mission is launched and like all projects things don't go as per plan.
The film is full of car chases, car crashes, shootings, explosions, fistfights, sniping with dozens of policemen/ goons getting injured or falling dead. Our heroes/ villains have barely the time to reload. All credit to the director and his cinematographer for creating continuous, pulsating, edge of the seat action majorly with a hand held contantly fluid camera. The viewer has no option, and he/she is sucked into the action through the vibrant cinematography supplemented with rocking music. A word for the crisp editing which makes the film racy.There are some splendid aerial shots to heighten the impact. Never a dull moment.
Chris is at home doing all the action. He gets a chance to emote too as his character has a soft side. Randeep Huda does well. The actor playing the boy's role impresses.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I wasn't expecting much in regards to story, but since the dawn of time, when has action meant character development? A lot of amazing one-shot takes, choreography and stunts. Seeing as the director is a stuntman himself, he managed to pioneer some amazing action scenes, POVs and perspectives.

It helps also that the kid isn't a complete idiot nor an annoying smart-ass, something that's all too common in a lot of Hollywood movies these days.All in all, fairly predictable but entertaining.

A Indian drug lords son is kidnapped and whisked away to Bangladesh. What follows is a double cross and some macho action that will leave fans is the genre satiated.

Some of us will love this just because it's full of action and of course the inclusion of Chris as the lead. And some of us will absolutely loathe it because it has zero plot importance and weak characterizations!To be honest I find myself in the middle. Frankly saying; Most of us already knew what's going to happen with the movie. You can't really expect much in terms of depth from an out to out action piece! And it surely stands out on what it promised.This has some scintillating action set pieces, with breathtaking adrenaline rush. Although the same scenes could look familiar for Regular Action fans but they look pretty good on screen nonetheless. The camera work here is phenomenal in those particular moments. The screenplay might not be that great but certainly it shines the most whenever any action starts. The technical efficiency can be easily noticed. I truly admire the efforts that have been put in by the Debutant Director here. As far the production value goes this ought to be on the top tier as Russo brothers are behind it. Hence the Execution looks matured in thrilling moments. I must mention that 11 Minute long one take scene; that looks magnificent. The Hand to Hand Combats, the Gun Fights all looked great as well. It's apparent that The technicalities are the major highlights over here.The performances are decent enough. Considering it's the Action Genre. But character build ups failed to impress. The writing falls short on many aspects. The Kid Character, he acted pretty well but I wanted to see more from him and his past or daily struggles. Being a Kid of a Druglord must be a Burdening thing on a day to day basis. Pankaj Tripathi as Indian Druglord; Well he was literally in one scene. It's Unfortunate to see such a talented individual getting such a low recognition here. Randeep Hooda as Saju was brilliant. Chris Hemsworth as Tyler performed great. His dedication and hardwork pays off.
The Bangladeshi druglord, well I see him as more of a Cliched overpowered villain like we used to get in 80's rather than a more structured modern day one.In the end It's a fast paced entertainer that hasn't got much depth in it. But it's full of Gruesome, Violent stuffs that Action Junkies might prefer a lot. For an ordinary group of audience this would be a Fun, Popcorn flick. Nothing more.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's cool that it does the location aspect well. My issues are when you have a seasoned mercenary I feel like he commits a lot of mistakes and gets into some situations that could have been avoided. There were a lot of tactical errors. First he goes in Rambo style, which is cool but if you're planning a mission up against 20 hostile, you need a squad. There is an ambiguous support character who seems battle hardened but his methods don't really add up. When you are senior military, you make sure you can win and you have the upper hand. But we see a lot of panic and escape here, not a cool controlled authority. It's a good movie but I think they should have ran it by a military consultant to make it more authentic.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Forty minutes into Extraction, Tyler (Chris Hemsworth) and Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) are dodging gunmen in a Dhaka building. They break into an apartment, and the famous intro to Didi Tera Dewar Deewana plays. They alight a floor, 10 seconds pass. Then, from another apartment, we hear snatches of Mehndi Laga Ke Rakhna. What are the chances that two instantly recognisable songs from two of the most famous Hindi films of the '90s are playing at the same time in present-day Dhaka? If this were set in the US, an equivalent scene would be Tyler rushing past one apartment as Rick says ""Here's looking at you, kid"" and another as Kane says ""Rosebud"". Not impossible, but unlikely.
Tyler does get Ovi out, but his escape from Dhaka is ruined by Saju's double-cross and the local police closing all exits at the behest of Amir. The film's big setpiece is a very long one-take sequence in which Tyler kills his way from the streets into a building and out again, a terrified Ovi boy tagging behind. Zero-cut extended action is no longer a novelty for moviegoers, but it's still an impressive trick if handled with some wit and variation. Tyler's bloody progress, though impressively choreographed, becomes somewhat monotonous - he moves and executes his kills like a soldier, all precision and no personality.
Its action may not spark much joy but when Extraction settles down for a quiet moment, that's when you're in real trouble. Not content with giving Tyler a formulaic tough guy backstory - his life falls apart after his six-year-old dies of cancer - the film also makes rich, unhappy Ovi, unloved by his own dad, the perfect candidate for a father figure. ""He thinks of me...more like a thing than a person,"" he says, unburdening to a complete stranger who just killed several dozen people and hit the one person he knows with a truck. Later, Ovi tells Tyler, ""You drown not by falling into the river but by staying submerged in it"", because that's how Hollywood thinks 14-year-olds in India talk.
Extraction is written by Joe Russo, and is produced and based on a story by him and his brother, Anthony, co-directors of four Marvel films. The source material, a graphic novel, is set in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay - the film simply swaps one third world country for another, as American movies tend to do. It's disappointing that the Russos, coming off the success of the last two Avengers films, would choose to put their weight behind yet another attempt to turn white protagonists going on a killing spree in foreign lands into some form of soul-searching. Tyler is treated like a gentle soul in torment, despite his frequent reminders that he is a killer for hire.
The film doesn't have any interest in Dhaka - it could be any dirty, corrupt city where Bangla (and some Hindi) is spoken. The one local character of note - Amir - is translated for Western audiences as the Pablo Escobar of his city. Extraction is by no means a realistic film, but it is set in the real world, which means the Russos can't fall back on comic mythos or easy utopias like Wakanda to explain its blinkered politics. Its white characters, also gathered in a poor country with the express purpose of killing its citizens, probably think of themselves as heroes too.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But perhaps, this is the type of film that is perfect for Netflix. Great action, serviceable story (but no true substance) with a movie star at the center. A movie you watch on a saturday afternoon while trying to relax. Hemsworth hasn't chosen the best projects outside of the MCU and this film is more of the same. I really do wonder if his career will veer more into comedy as the years go by, since that is clearly a major strength of his. Extraction is solid, but it certainly isn't fulfilling my desire for the summer blockbuster (which we've been lacking because of COVID). Oh well.6.8/10","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

It isn't. Unfortunately it's largely run of the mill, but it does have a few great action sequences that elevate it above similar straight-to-video nonsense.Ovi Mahajan (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), son of an imprisoned Indian drug lord, is kidnapped by Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli) his father's Bangladeshi rival. Knowing that he'll be held to account for this, Saju (Randeep Hooda) a lieutenant in the Indian family and Ovi's guardian engages a crack mercenary team to extract the boy. The team, with Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) on point, successfully rescue Ovi, but soon discover that Asif's massive influence of the Police, Army and his own street gangs make getting out almost impossible.As I said in the opening paragraph, there are a few action scenes in this film that are much better than the overall film deserves. The rescue scene is visceral exciting close combat stuff, but it was the later driving scene where I really started to take notice - particularly of the excellent camera work. The camera tracks the vehicle, circulates to the front when the car needs to reverse and then, in a bravura move, enters the car and sits on the back seat. There are a number of ""John Wick"" type gun fights for the remainder of the film which, whilst never quite hitting the heights of that franchise, are OK.That said, the rest of the film is a pretty predictable and generic thriller and you'll see the twists and plot points coming a mile off. I can understand why it had Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis attached at various points. Chris Hemsworth is OK, better than either of those would have been, even if it does feel like him playing ""sad action man"" is a bit of a waste, given his comedic talent. Randeep Hooda is given more of an arc, and provides a better performance because of it.Perfectly acceptable way to spend a couple of hours, but I'll never watch it again.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Honestly, this is what it means to make a truly International Film.The things that work for the film -1) The diverse cast and crew - only a dull person would not appreciate such diversity!2) The Action - The fact that Sam Hargrave was on the Director's Chair I expected nothing short of brilliant action sequences. After all he is the Brain behind the action stunts Of many Action/ Superhero Films.3) The background score - It's edgy, it keeps you active and engrossed in the film.4) The story - it's engaging, I like the character development. Of course there are things that could be improved on but I'm in no mood to complain today. So I'm just going to appreciate.I really enjoyed the chemistry of Chris Hemsworth and the young Rudraksh Jaiswal. A job well done there!5) Location - This film proves that you don't need the Swiss Alps and Dubai skyscrapers to make a good film. The premise is focused and it's good to see that the makers didn't compromise on it by trying to make things look pretty.Also, I am so happy for Randeep Hooda, I read in an old interview of his (think it was in 2013) that he went to university in Australia to pursue a career in Acting in Hollywood but things fell apart. And here comes Extraction - with an Actor from Australia and a Hollywood based project! How perfect to see someone being able to accomplish their dreams.

Lots and LOTS of action but the story itself was weak. Not really much of a story at all, to be honest. Honestly, there isn't much to write home about with this movie outside the fact that it's basically 'Call of Duty' meets 'John Wick.' It's a fun way to spend a night and probably has some re-watch value if you're bored enough.***Side Note Rant***Yeah, I get how some Bengali would feel some type of way of how Dhaka is portrayed in the film. One thing I don't appreciate is how those same people will quickly associate the violence and action portrayed in the film to African countries (which have also been one-sided and poorly represented in the world media for decades). You kind of lose the point of your argument when you use other counties' hyper stigmatized issues as a shield to defend your own representation. I'm with you on the misrepresentation, but please, STFU on using African countries as your go-to scapegoate.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The seemingly straightforward rescue goes south when those who hired our protagonist (Chris Hemsworth) refuse to pay the fee they have agreed on, instead trying to bypass Hemsworth and rescue the kid themselves. Add to the mix the rival crime lord in Dhaka, whose people originally kidnapped the boy but have lost him to Hemsworth and now will use all of their resources, including most of the bought and paid for police and military personnel on the payroll, to recover or kill the boy.This movie has great action sequences and cinematography going for it, but it needed a better sound editor, as many of the regional Indian dialects sound like mumbling to the western ear. Also many of the vehicles and scenes looked more like India than Bangladesh. Even Thailand was listed on the ending credits as one filming location, but it is difficult to pick out any scenes that looked like Thailand.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Some the camera work is unique and better than I have ever seen in a realistic fight sequence. You will feel like you a right there in the action. Some of the shots are one take, and clearly took incredible coordination to pull off.. Hemsworth has shown himself be a superb, top tier action star, and I foresee him in many more to come. He has the emotional and physical acting chops to make every scene believable, and his character is both complex and relatable.This film is also much more realistic in its gun use, characters actually reload repeatedly, check weapons for bullets, and constantly use cover accurately. Enemies actually take multiple hits and shots to go down, they don't just take one kick to the chest and die like in the majority of other action films.The plot overall could have some improvements, but it does not take away much from the film. The primary villain needed some more motivating factors, but the film will make you hate him enough to root for anyone who stands against him.I've seen the vast majority of negative reviews are solely based on the fact that the negative aspects of life in Dhaka might be slightly over emphasized, but doing research on my own, it is not significantly different than reality. So I would recommend disregarding the majority of negative reviews and give this film a watch if you enjoy action films. I guarantee you will be amazed by the action sequences and come away impressed with the film.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The women seen as passive and weak was basic, boring, unnecessary, ruined the movie a little bit (maybe if you did not include the romance in it , the flirting or the women seen as passive & weak and the man being so crazy in love with the women while still being married the movie would have received a 10/10 bc that stuff made the movie look like it was trying to hit the box office with gross revenue but does not feel like it would. It just spoiled the movie which made the movie loose 4 stars). The emotional drama was also not needed and it was super dramatic and it also ruined the movie as well. Going back to the women being all dramatic and desperate after the man also not necessary ; like make a choice do you want to spoil the movie or keep the movie entertaining. If you do then just keep the shooting, killing and fighting that is it , no need to put the romance drama in it to make a movie (that is already entertaining) entertaining (which it really did not but instead spoiled it). Sometimes too much extra can ruin a perfect masterpiece.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Definitely one of those films you set aside any character development or story. Just enjoy the action flick for what it is. Chris Hemsworth leads the role and he can take on a heroic character. Like how Keanu Reeves leads John Wick. Hemsworth takes a beating. He uses guns, objects, or knives in any fight he can get into. Chris Hemsworth plays a mercenary, who is assigned to rescue a drug lords son in Dhaka. While the kidnappers who puts a huge bounty on the sons life which has the corrupt police, military, and other henchmen all after the son and Chris Hemsworth. The film is action packed. The director can manage the action sequences. It is brutal. And there is one long take with the action scene that was impressive. The character Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) who is the drug lord son. I will say the weakest thing about the movie is Rudhraksh Jaiswal performance. It was hard to understand his dialogue with all the mumbling every time he spoke.Otherwise, Extraction is a good action film. Chris Hemsworth is great. The film is non stop with the exciting brutal action. If your into shoot em up films like John Wick. Than this movie would be for you.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Direction is just flawless. The American Stuntman turned Director Sam Hargrave just nailed it. He knows how to do action scenes without disrespecting Newton. He made the Pace fast where needed and slowed up where it called for one simple conversation between characters. Just incredible.
2. Performances of most of the characters. Chris Hemsworth AKA Thor didn't let us down and delivered An impeccable performance. His sense of every emotion is just amazing. He makes you feel every time he goes through some emotion. And when he pronounces ""Proman dao"" so flawless you'll just feel that One is dubbed but no. He Said it. But he said ""teka"" instead of ""taka"" but it seemed that he learned bengali from a Bangladeshi instead. Overall a ""Worth it"" performance.
3. Shataf Figar as Bangladeshi Army Colonel was just on point. He didn't mispronounced a single bangla word wrong. And his presence and personality was just extraordinary. He did look like a real colonel.
4. An extraordinary performance came from Suraj Rikame as Farhad. Though his role was very short but very very important. He was the finding of this film. His ""on point"" expressions and greatly pronounced bangla makes his performance a great one. He has a Bright future.Bad things about the film:1. I didn't like particularly just disliked the performance of One character is of Rudraksh Jaiswal as Ovi Mahajan in this film. His expressions were Same at every scene. He just disgraced Chris's performance. May be he was baffled a little bit in front of ""Thor"". But in comparison Suraj Rikame just stole the show as an teenage antagonist. Only one dialogue that strikes was ""You drown not by falling into the river, but staying submerged in it."" but it was only the dialogue, Not the way he delivered it.
2. Particularly didn't like the pronunciation of bangla words by Priyanshu Painyuli as Amir Asif. He was just a typical north Indian speaking bengali after few classes. I mean seriously? In that level you can't do that he should have been replaced by an bengali actor from Bengal or Bangladesh either. Very disappointed with that as a bengali.
3. Story line was predictable after the first half.
4. Pankaj Tripathi was used only in one scene. They couldn't capitalize on his master class.
5. The Director seriously needed More homework about the music taste of Bangladeshi people obviously. Because, you can hear only Bollywood songs (Most of them are SRK songs from 90's and 2000's and From Gully Boy too) playing in households while a chasing scene. I mean seriously? You could have added a ""Khairon lo tor lomba mathar kesh, Chirol daanter hasi diya pagol korli desh"" instead. They did add a bangla rap in a car scene though (Not ""Ripon Miyar Bangladesh"" though).(Quick facts: All the Dhaka scenes were shoot in India only. Australia scenes were shoot in Thailand. AND THERE IS NO MANOJ TIWARY IN THE CAST. GOOGLE SHOWS IT WRONG WHEN YOU SEARCH FOR ""EXTRACTION CAST"".)Should You Watch It Or Not?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I love going to the movies so much and I miss seeing stuff on the big screen, so when I see good stuff like Extraction, it makes me a little depress that I only have a 32 itch screen to watch this on.I herd that Chris Hemsworth was actually tapped to star in an American adaption of the Indonesian film The Raid. I don't know if that movie will ever happen but Extraction is a good alternative. Watching Thor brawl through an army on the streets of Mumbai is too exciting, and they do these single cut action sequences that make me feel like they are crossing 1917 with a John Wick film.Produced by the Russo brothers who directed Hemsworth in Avengers: infinity War and Avengers End game, it feels like the Brothers are into solid action movies as they did one last year called 21 Bridges which also stared an Avenger, the Black Panther, Chadwick Bosman.The plot does not cut deep enough, but this movie is all about the visual energy coming from it. That's why it saddens me that I did not get to experience this in a dark theatre looking up at a huge screen, trying to stuff my face with popcorn and soda without take my eyes off the action.The movie theatres were made for these kinds of flicks and I can't wait to get back in those reclining seats.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

His services are required by an agency run by a brother and sister. The assignment? Rescue a boy and escort him out of Dhaka, Bangladesh. Oppositional forces and unexpected obstacles threaten to derail the mission in order to fulfill their own angle. This performance from Chris Hemsworth was a nice departure from the goofy antics of the latest Thor films. He plays a more stern and objective driven character that is given just enough tenderness to make him more of a human character than a walking robot who causes destruction. Speaking of which, this is marketed as an action film and it is most certainly that. It's executed with the right energy and pace to get your adrenaline up and the filmmakers take it in interesting directions. While the action is great, the story is pretty thin. It's the case where the narrative is more in service to the action scenes, rather than the characters, ideas, or world. Nonetheless, I recommend this one if you want an unpretentious, competently shot, thrill ride for two hours.

Tyler Rake(Hemsworth),a mercenary,is hired to rescue the boy of an Indian Gang leader who got kidnapped by another deadly crime lord. Thats was the entire plot though. The story becomes secondary while making the action primary and,they did achieve what they intended. For starters, Chris Hemsworth was good in this, he did have a really good charisma in this and he was the only one to get a bit of additional character detailing. Ovi Mahajan(Jaiswal), the plot device, had less characterisation but, was likable and had more emotional attachment towards the end. Nik Khan(Farahani) and Saju(Hooda) were also good although they were one dimensional. David Harbour had a small cameo which was actually good. The villain was bland.
Speaking about the other aspects,the movie did have pretty good action sequences. The long fight sequence in the first half of the movie is my favorite. They utilized the 'R' rating properly. The violence was extreme at certain times, unlike in Deadpool which seemed comical,this was more realistic and brutal. The movie was made by a stuntman and he did ensure really good action sequences. There were really good camera movements in this and choreography was good. The music was apt for this. The biggest con of this movie which I felt was that this whole movie felt like a video game. First we had a bit of character interactions,then fights, slowing down to interactions and continuing. This was still a watchable movie, guilty pleasure to be precise.
I recommend this movie to every action lovers, Hemsworth fans and to everyone who needs some adrenaline during quarantine.Rating: 7/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The cast list is good enough to make it an excellent block buster but seems the story failed to bind the cast with it.
This movie has some of the best camera work.
It also has AMAZING fighting choreography!
Overall a really, REALLY tight action movie.

Extraction has a very short story which can be expressed in a line: a young boy is kidnapped; a mercenary is sent out to rescue him.
That boy is Ovi Mahajan (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the son of a jailed Indian drug lord (Pankaj Tripathi). The one-man rescue operation is Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth).Ovi was kidnapped by Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli), Bangladesh's biggest drug lord, who also controls the country's police and military,in Dhaka. Ovi, who lives in Mumbai with his father's underling, Saju (Randeep Hooda) who was in Indian Special Forces before,who knows a team that can bring the boy back to India.Tyler reaches the kidnapper's den: we get a longish violent showdown. Ovi and Tyler manage to escape: we get an even longer action set piece. The climax is expectedly more violent, where all the characters converge with an assortment of weapons.In the worst sceniario when things get complicated,all the world want Tyler to leave Ovi in Dhaka to save himself,he ensures Ovi that he will leave Dhaka only with Ovi though he will not get the money as he does not want to loss another child's life after losing his own child who was died by cancer.From then it was purely action sequence like car chasing in congested areas of Dhaka,fighting with cops,escaping from the guards etc with very limited story line.Based upon rural areas of Dhaka,it shows the effective power of Drug lord on the country's Security forces,Child labour including training them with varieties of heavy weapons from very young age to be extremist.From here on,someone attacks, someone counterattacks, someone monitors and plans.Screenplay by Joe Russo was good though the shots were too yellowish to show the impact of the rurality of Dhaka.When it comes to individual performances,Chris Hemsworth was outstanding at action sequences,dialogue delivering(specially those Bengali word ""Proman Dao"").The boy(Rudhrash) was equally good in screen but Randep Hooda as Saju was exceptional,his dedication towards the whole screenplay was fabulous,he hardly has left any fault to criticize.However for a pure entertainment and Action sequence adventure,You can surely give it a watch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was refreshing to hear Hemsworth not only keep his Australian accent, but embrace the fact his character was Australian. It gave the one-liners an Aussie edge which I loved (as a fellow Aussie) and definitely enhanced my overall enjoyment of the film.Hemsworth was well-suited to this role and it perhaps signaled an entire career direction taking place. The action scenes are the highlight. The storyline was really just a backdrop to what were some of the best action cinematography and fight scenes I've seen in a while. There was a grittiness and realism which perhaps set it apart from the likes of John Wick - which it will no doubt be compared to.The setting of the film itself was a somewhat refreshing change from the usual. It simply added to the intensity of what was happening on screen. I was craving some explosions and shootout entertainment - and this certainly satisfied that itch!An ambiguous ending is sure to divide some viewers. But ultimately, Extraction was fairly satisfying and did exactly what it said on the packet.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There was not enough space between action scenes to make you care about the characters. Don't get me wrong. It was good in its own way. Acting was great!

I was very bias for what seemed to be another modern day action feature; however director Sam Hargrave provided an Australian John Wick instead! The action was incredible, choreography was jaw droppingly flawless. The connections after being shot, punched and thrown against a hard object felt authentic and added to the somewhat realistic fighting style; camera movements were gorgeous, not too shaky to bring disorientation yet not too smooth to take you out of the extremity. The cinematography was adequate, and at times would tell a story in itself which was surprising. The one shot takes were perfect for the moments presented and although cuts weren't well hidden to an experienced viewer, could easily fool a naked eye. Hemsworth's character, although a stereotypical Australian cliche, was enjoyable to watch. In all, the Australian stereotype was smart as it contributed a mateship sentiment to the story. Hemsworth brought an absorbing performance, being unpretentious yet grandiose in action sequences yet considerate and gentle in tender moments. And I appreciated the inner turmoil his character carried, making this more than a shoot, kill, shoot movie. The dialogue was stale but got it's point across. However, the sporadicity in language variations was questionable as to why characters would switch between two languages. The story was as long as it needed to be, little to nothing felt overstayed or unwelcomed other than the subplot of the Bangladesh boy. The ending is touching yet extremely lazy in terms of tying loose ends. And the 'resurrection' of Hemsworth's character was not needed as it destroyed the meaning of his sacrifice. Overall, an exceptional action picture that I'd suggest watching if you're in need of one.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is a black market mercenary hired to bring the drug lord's son home in what proves to be one of his toughest assignments to date...It's probably fair to say that if you choose to sit down and watch Extraction that you're unlikely to be blown away by its story; however if you are a fan of action films with plenty of shoot em up sequences then you should find this film to be relatively enjoyable.Arguably the biggest flaw with this film lies with the story itself; 2 drug lords are at war with each other but we're never really given any explanation as to what their beef is with each other? Still as I've said this doesn't really matter in the moment as there is always something happening in this film (shoot outs and fisticuffs come thick and fast in this picture) which, in fairness, is what you'd come to expect with films of this nature.Hemsworth does a solid job (he's a good physical presence, but unlike some of his counterparts that we see in action films he also does well from an 'acting' perspective as well). The villains are a little clichéd, but nobody disgraces themselves here.Although it feels a little generic and underwritten the fast pace and neat actions sequences make it worthwhile.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's an all out action film with some absolutely brilliant action scenes, the long takes worked so well and was really good to watch. The reason why I enjoyed it is because it's an almost mindless action plot where there's car chases, guns, fighting, explosions and more guns. Sometimes people just need a release and watch some simple good action and this is it.Linking to what I just said, the plot. So, it doesn't go into any kind of depth into the villain whatsoever, it was just this is who he is, deal with it. Why did he have all this power? He just needed depth. He was also barely in it. Like I said before it didn't bother me at all, but I can see why that would fuss a lot of others. Same concept for a lot of the characters that wasn't the kid or Tyler (Hemsworth).Overall if you like action films then give this a watch. It has all the elements you want and shot superbly. Oh, the acting is half decent as well. Rate this a lot.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I am slightly disappointed as I'd heard great things about an action sequence oner and it was Netflix's number one film at time of watching. It didn't really live up to this hype, but was still an enjoyable action film nonetheless.The action was fun although a tad repetitive by the end. I did feel like we were getting the same sequences just in different locations for some parts of the film. Saying that though there was some great camera work during the close quarters combat, particularly a scene in an apartment building following a car chase. The choreography was always tight, maintaining a gritty and dangerous feel. Pretty unforgiving at times in its violence and pace, Extraction does provide solid entertainment.With regards to the plot... it was so so. Nothing stand out, nothing bad. There are some action films driven by plot, far more driven by action, and this was definitely one of the latter. In this sense then the plot was good as it facilitated the action sequences and they all made sense and flowed within the world that was created. Nothing felt too out of place or fantastical, with the action remaining (for the most part) in the realms of plausibility.Overall Extraction is a fun watch but nothing more. Its not revolutionary or ground breaking in the genre, but is a good two hours of entertainment and well worth watching if action films are your thing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Chris Hemsworth has been hired on a mission to Extract a boy, the kidnapped son of an Indian Drug lord, held in captive by a gangster from Bangladesh. Subsequently, as things fly off the handle, and with an armed professional behind his back, the remainder of the movie explores how Chris Hemsworth manages to protect this boy's life while hanging on a suicide mission that manages to get deadlier every single second.
Screenplay by Joe Russo is Strictly okey as the Depth & Exciting twists in the story is missing but Director Sam Hargrave has executed Brilliantly and Delivered the full dose of Entertainment
BG Music by Henry Jackman and Alex Belcher is impactful.
Newton Thomson Nigel's camera work amazes you by capturing the streets of Bangladesh stunningly, and the stunt scenes, especially the continuous shots during the fight sequences are highly enjoyable.
Director Sam Hargrave has really gone out of the way to capture some shots we haven't seen on this scale in a long time.

1. That Sultana Kamal Bridge is more beautiful than what you showed in the movie.2. There are some slums in Dhaka but that will not be more than 7 or 8 small slums right now. But you have shown that all city is a slum.3. Dhaka's road is more cleaner and buildings are more beautiful than what you have shown in this movie.4. Police dress, Army dresses are not accurate at all. You have shown a police man wearing both Police badge and Army Force named badges.5. Huge spelling mistakes in Bengali police man's name plates, banners.6. That kind of dirty shops and houses don't belong to Bangladesh.7. There are so much traffic jam in Bangladesh which is true but you will see all famous car brands in the road. But you have shown some junk cars everywhere.8. There is no jungle exist near Buriganga river.9. All Bengali pronunciations are so bad and inaccurate.10. There is not teenager goons available in Bangladesh with arms.11. Bangladesh Police uses better APC like Kobra Otokar12. You can't enter into Bangladesh swerage line in that way and height is far little than that you have shown in the movie.13. In near Buriganga river there so much beautiful historical places available. Dhaka is a continuous city for more than 400 years.14. Bangladesh people don't wear that kind of Panjabi and costumes. Most of the people here wear western dresses, and different Panjabis.15. Police, and obviously no army person will take order from a drug dealer in Bangladesh.16. No drug dealer can live in that way in bangladesh. Either he will be jailed for sure or will be died from gun fight with the police.17. Bengali speaking actors should be more professional with Bengali pronunciations and acting as well.18. Bengladeshi very low class hotel has better architectural units than what garbage you have shown in the movie.If you make something please do better study and research on that. Before making such thing on Bangladesh name first visit Bangladesh. In case you need free air ticket you can knock me. At least I can clear your wrong perceptions.

"1","/10","Honest review of Extraction: Russo Brothers do everything right except the Bangla","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5671688/?ref_=tt_urv","rarony","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur69131561/?ref_=tt_urv","24 April 2020","The Bangla language and Bangladeshi people, more accurately Dhaka's residents, were not accurately portrayed in Extraction. Yet it marks the beginning of an era where the stories of the capital of this small nation are being told by the Hollywood infrastructure to the whole world for the very first time on this scale. Events like these are important for Bangladesh and its filmmakers to create the urge in them to craft such stories on a massive scale for the global audience; stories which will be the accurate representations of the rich history, heritage and diversity of Dhaka.Except for the smartly handled production design choices, action packed fight sequences, and Hemsworth's Asgardian god like charms nothing else really works in the movie. The screenplay is poorly written and lacks emotion. Though this is a spoiler free review yet there is really nothing more to the story line. The film feels like a two hour long fight sequence with some bandage breaks like a PUBG match on your phone.We see a Bangladeshi drug lord kidnap an Indian crime lord's son and Tyler is unleashed to extract him from Dhaka. But why the big names of the subcontinental criminal underworld came to this rivalry, why these desperate measures are unclear.Another problematic thing is the portrayal of Bangladesh's law enforcement agencies. Every agency including the police, a fictional force named ""Elite"" which looked like Bangladesh's Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), and even the Bangladeshi military were portrayed to the worldwide audience that they were controlled and bribed by Dhaka based international drug cartels which is fictional but still problematic.It paints a picture to the world that Dhaka is like Medellin in Colombia during the Pablo Escobar era which is far from true.The screenplay could have supported some residents or law enforcement officers who were not criminals or involved in drug rings to balance this but every scene of Dhaka felt very wrongly portrayed.Then comes the main issue of the whole film, the Indian actors who played Bangladeshi roles. Not a single one of them was talking Bangla in a ""Dhakaite"" accent or even a Bangladeshi one. Some Indian actors were completely butchering the language and most Dhaka based characters in the film sounded like they had a West Bengal based accent and pronunciation. Bangladeshi netizens were quick to respond to this error and complained that the producers of the film did not give attention to the language at all and how no one in Dhaka speaks like the way these characters in this film do.The creators of the project should have kept in mind that Bangla language is the quintessential element of Bengali identity and they are the only nation who had given their lives for their mother tongue. So a faulty dialect of this language will become a sensitive issue for the Netflix users of this country.Another huge issue was the acting of the kidnapped kid Ovi, played by Indian actor Rudraksh Jaiswal. As one of the lead characters of the film and having a huge screen time his acting weakness bores the viewers. Most of his dialogue deliveries are typical Bollywood melodrama and in some scenes beside Hemsworth he seems redundant and ridiculous.","12 out of 24 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Fun, by-the-numbers, action flick","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5714023/?ref_=tt_urv","bankofmarquis","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10919398/?ref_=tt_urv","6 May 2020","I'm pretty sure that no matter what, I was going to enjoy the Chris Hemsworth action flick EXTRACTION whether it was good or not. It is, after all, a NEW movie, albeit one that was made ""Direct to Netflix"", so those can be of lesser quality.I'm happy to report that in the case of EXTRACTION, that is not the case. This is a good (if by the books) popcorn action flick with a charismatic lead keeping you company throughout.In EXTRACTION, Chris Hemsworth stars as an Australian Mercenary (who knew there was such a thing), hired to extract the kidnapped son of a drug lord from the hands of his fiercest rival.This is a pretty ""by-the-numbers"" action film:1). The mercenary has ""baggage"" - will the events (and the subject he is to extract) help him come to terms with his pent-up emotions in order to move past his traumatic ""baggage""?2). Will there be some sort of ""double-cross"" that screws up the extraction causing our hero to go ""on the run"" with his ""Extraction""?3). Will there be a buddy that our hero trusts who will, ultimately, double-cross him?What do you think?The fun of this film was not the plot machinations (they are pretty basic), but the execution of these machinations - and this execution is pretty fun/enjoyable.Start with Chris Hemsworth as our mercenary - with the great action flick name of Tyler Rake. Hemsworth knows exactly what kind of film he is in - and he brings the goods. If he chose to, I think Hemsworth could be an action hero staple like Jason Statham or Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson - but I think Hemsworth is not really interested in that. But here, he is steely eyed and calm taking hits and doling out punishment to hoards of ""red shirt"" bad guys in his way. He has the action hero chops. He also has the acting chops to make the overwrought ""emotional"" scenes palatable. He makes weak writing enjoyable.Joining him is Rudhraksh Jaiswal as ""the extraction"" - and his interactions with Hemsworth are fun. Randeep Hodha and Golshifteh Farahani do a nice job in the roles that they play in the action and the always watchable David Harbour eats a ton of scenery in his limited time on the screen. All are fun to watch.But it is the telling of the story by first time Director Sam Hargrave that was a (pleasant) surprise for me. After doubling Chris Evans in the first CAPTAIN AMERICA film, Hargrave became the ""go to"" guy for Marvel action choreography, so (I'm sure) he got to know Hemsworth there. He brings a fast-paced style to this film that works. He doesn't stop to examine much at all (which helps the plot holes in the script) and his action work with his stunt actors is top-notch. If you watch nothing else in this film, check out the chase scene at about the 1/3 mark of the film. Hemsworth and ""the extraction"" are being chased - and it is filmed in the ""shaky cam/cinema veritae/ make it look like one long tracking shot"" style that I often criticize in my reviews - but here it worked and worked well. I'll be keeping my eye on what Hargrave does next (word is it that there will be an Extraction 2).All of this is brought together by Producers Joe and Anthony Russo - the Directors of many Marvel films (including INFINITY WAR and ENDGAME). Not only did they Produce this film, but they wrote the story from where this film came from. It's obvious that they turned the majority of the screenplay writing to others (most notably Ande Parks) and this film is based on a graphic novel...so it plays like an over-the-top comic book action flick (think John Wick-lite) where the dialogue is sparse and cliche-ridden. This part of the film was far less interesting than the action parts.But, the action is fast, fun and furious and Hemsworth is worth watching for the 1 hour 56 minute running time.All-in-all, a good time was had while watching the first ""new"" film in over 6 weeks.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's so hard to believe the director has only done 6 films (most of them being short films) I think he has a huge career in front of him as a director.
The acting was great and the filming locations made it film incredibly raw and real.

I've been lucky enough to dedicate this time to catching up on some of the latest releases on Netflix.If you're looking for a good action film to enjoy on late night then you'll be satisfied with Chris Hemsworth's latest project - Extraction. The film is based around the character Tyler Rake, an ex pay for hire mercenary, who takes up one last job; to rescue an Indian mob leader's kidnapped son from a rival mobster and the largest drug dealer in Bangladesh. Expect spectacular fighting sequences, explosions and exhilarating car chases as director Sam Hargrave takes us on the whirlwind mission in his debut film.Given Hargrave's stunt background (famously known as Captain America's stunt double), there was a lot of potential for the action sequences to bring this film to life. We see glimpses of Hargraves talents shine, in particular, during a fight scene that takes place once Rake attempts to recover mob leader's son Ovi. The close combat flights are captured well, we feel the intensity of the fight through the shoes of Rake. The director wants us to feel every punch and kick which engages us as the audience. Hargraves stunt background definitely adds an edge to this film, he is able to satisfy us the audience through the intense fighting and excessive violence, similar to that used in the Asian action films such as the Raid.With the majority of the film being shot in Dhaka Bangladesh, one of the most densely populated cities in the world; Rakes task seems even more unrealistic as he is one man in foreign country against an entire mob. Hargraves does well at using this location to create chaos. In particular, during the car chase we feel overwhelmed and on the edge of our seats as there's people everywhere and often a lot of near misses. However, what stood out to me during this scene and the fight scene was the camera. Hargraves repeatedly uses a one shot, similar to that used in 1917. This shot is effective as Hargraves is able to make us feel like we're following Rake through the chaos.Although, this film doesn't stand out from its competition in the action genre. It feels like Hemsworth is attempting to solidify himself as a solo lead by creating a lane for himself. perhaps for when he decides to hang his boots as the role of Thor within the marvel cinematic.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Great action movie.... But a weak plot weighs it down...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5820722/?ref_=tt_urv","swaroopsrijit","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur116206545/?ref_=tt_urv","13 June 2020","Now already my expectations from this movie in terms of action was very high, and this movie hasn't disappointed me in that factor..
Firstly, let me tell you what I DID NOT like about this film
1. The Location...
The location of this movie is primarily based in Bangladesh, and because they wanted to portray the action sequences brutally, they went for a tightly spaced location which was quite rural and not actually like how Bangladesh looks like, and many Bangladeshis had an issue with this... Now they could have changed the plot in another manner to not let this happen, but it is something to be pointed out as a negative factor..
2. Lack of Character depth...
This movie primarily focuses on Tyler, the 14 year old Ovi and Saju of course, but there were so many more characters who could have got a better role, and they lacked character depth, even Chris Hemsworth's past wasn't that satisfactory... If the characters had bit more of a content, it would have helped the plot to be better as well...
Now what I LIKED about the film
1. The Hand to hand combat, chase sequences and Gunfights
I am not gonna type much about this cuz you got to watch the movie for that
2. The performances (The Cast)
Every character in this movie was excellent with great acting. Chris Hemsworth's character is well written and his emotional moments are also good... Randeep Hooda was awesome and finally got recognition for his talent through this film... all other characters were good too...
3. The emotional moments
This film is also gonna surprise you wth some emotional moments as well like between the child and Tyler, and even the emotional bonding between them...
It would be impactful for even those who do not like action films
As a whole I would just say that though the movie is not that good in terms of its storyline, it would not fail to impress in the action... Watch it if you r a die hard action film fan
Skip it if you r looking for an engaging plot with twists and turns and less violence","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

His on-screen resilience and charisma fit so effectively with the protagonist. It was also refreshing to see him star in darker-themed movie with a very timely and relevant subject matter. The stunt were good, although I've seen better stunts in these kind of movies. The production design were superb and so believable and accurate, depicting the slums of India (or Bangladesh as shown in the film). The director really invested in focusing the spotlight on the protagonist and that was what made the movie so watchable.

With the odds stacked against him, Tyler finds his physical and mental resolve put to the test as the stakes become increasingly personal.A throwback to 80's style one-man-killing-machine action flicks that gave Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger their respective careers, Extraction's title also doubles as a pretty accurate synopsis of the film.Fronted by Hemsworth in another solid action leading man role, Extraction is a straight-shooting, no-nonsense ride that goes for the jugular when it comes to action. As Tyler travels through Dhaka, Bangladesh with the kidnapped kid in tow, he finds himself chased by crime lords, corrupt police officers and even child soldiers. The action is relentless and the film transitions from car chases to rooftop scuffles and street standoffs all within minutes of each other, making Extraction feel like it could have worked well as a single-take film had the filmmakers decided to take it up a notch.Naturally, comparisons to John Wick are inevitable, not least for being another feature debut for a stunt coordinator turned director. However, Extraction's endless onslaught of bloodshed ends up having the opposite effect of John Wick. Long before the film's protracted finale, the relentless shooting and killing becomes numbing rather than exhilarating, largely due to the exploitative nature of the story.Unlike the hyper-realism of John Wick, Extraction grounds itself in the gritty geo-political climate of a third world country (Thailand doubling for Bangladesh) and the grimy subtext of police corruption and organised crime is exploited for mind-numbing action carnage. It works on a basic thrill-level but leaves the film mired in questionable politics and a general air of callousness.That's why the Michael Bay school of switch off your brain to enjoy applies whole heartedly here. Extraction does not short-change viewers looking for a solid action flick to sink their teeth into, just don't expect to find much meat on its bones.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's a beautifully crafted movie with commendable cinematography, good action sequences and beautifully visualized South Asian countries.

It's an engaging action movie with some fine long shots and enjoyable action sequences
What did not work:
Even if the movie ended with showing the lead actor( not wanting to spoil the movie) visually, it would have worked as well. One thing that is not bad for the eyes but less convincing is the idea of one man army destroying the army effortlessly. It's one of those movies

Keanu Reeves' character bobbed and wove through seamless action scenes littered with bodies and close quarter pistol techniques that were both brutal and poetic. Extraction brings the efficiency and intensity of battling for survival to the underworld of India in the hands of Chris Hemsworth's haunted mercenary- Tyler Rake.The character introductions are well handled, with Tyler's depression clearly signalling a painful past. Flashbacks are used to hint at the nature of this past, without fully becoming clear until the final act. Tyler is recruited to a mission that he says no other mercenary would touch, and this again signifies Tyler's broken state accepting a mission that is bound to go wrong. There is more characterization done on Tyler's counterpart, the man hired to protect the victim from the start, with a clearly defined motivation and predicament around the boy - Ovi, who is excellently played by Rudhraksh Jaiswal.
What follows is an intense series of action scenes with few breaks for exposition before wrapping up in the final act.Where the story succeeds most is in the dynamic visuals and the scant dialogue is effective in furthering the plot while racking up a massive body count. Scenes move smoothly from running through the jungle, to a furious car chase, before the camera travels out a window into a building chase sprawling multiple rooms and floors before crashing from a balcony into the streets again. This gives little time for characters to emote beyond grunts of exertion and desperation. This leads to some of the films shortfalls, moral ambiguity and lack of vested interest.
Far too little time is spent getting to know characters that their loss is hardly felt, while others undergo significant screen time that ends in tragic survival. This undermines the primary antagonist when subordinates demonstrate agency over their actions without consequences and often in ways that don't affect the narrative arc. A show down takes place, for example, between a background character that has had only a few short lines, while significant time is spent flushing out the unexplained thirst for violence in a young person who ultimately fails to contribute much to the plot at all. This leads to a moral ambiguity that is emphasized by a conversation between Tyler and an old friend - There are no good guys.Tyler demonstrates many admirable traits in the film, willing to stick with things to the bitter end, driven by something deep within him. He fights for what he thinks is right and does it well. He is however working for a drug lord to rescue his son from another drug lord. No matter where you point, there is no moral high ground, and there is legitimate concerns raised over the permanence of their actions, causing many questions to be left with simplistic or incomplete answers.The end result is a genuinely impressive action film, which benefits from a simple viewing. There are some deeper themes hinted at, not very well flushed out, but for sheer adrenaline and stylistic violence, it is a well done film. Chris Hemsworth and the other leads deliver on pretty well all fronts, and the production is very well done.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I it is an one hour fifty seven minutes action movie. Main Strength in this movie is its action, the performance of lead actor Chris Hemsworth and supporting actor Randeep Hooda in action department were very good, specially a hand to hand combat scene between Chris and Randeep was worth watching. But the main drawback in this film is its average storyline and weak screenplay it fails to engage the audience for the whole two hours. Technical aspects like VFX is also good but I feel adequate reasearch was not done on Dhaka city because at some scenes of the film we hear old hindi songs in background but Dhaka is a bengali speaking city. Acting performance of Chris Hemsworth, Randeep Hooda and Rudraksh Jaiswal were very good but the performance of Priyanshu Puniyali who plays the main antagonist in this film was not upto the mark.

postpone due to COVID-19 impact across the globe. At this time, the only saviour is digital platforms like Netflix which aired its one
of the most anticipated film, Extraction, at least during this lock down period. I just completed watching Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda
starrer and felt a real action flick has arrived that will pump up your adrenaline especially on Friday evening.Extraction tells the story of Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) who is a dreaded mercenary and supposed to rescue the son of warlord in Mumbai
from clutches of his competitor in Bangladesh. The rescue operation goes haywire when he is interrupted by unknown intruders.From the Avengers directors Russo brothers - Anthony and Joe Russo (who also wrote the Graphic novel ""Ciudad"", on which film is based),
Extraction is directed by Sam Hargrave who has done the stunts in some 80 films, including the Marvel super heroes flicks like Avengers : Endgame
and Avengers : Infinity WarThe movie starts with a bang as Tyler Rake goes all the possible way the moment rescue operations initiates. Tyler he faces the goons where he fights with knives and guns which is brilliantly choreographed followed by an eye-popping car chase scene as Tyler drives through the busy streets of Dhaka.
I would like to highlight that this probably one of the best car chase scenes which an outstanding camera work. The street-fight between Randeep Hooda is another spectacular treat to watch out as both actors does well in the hand combat.If you think this is enough, hold on as there is a high-octane climax scene with jaw-dropping stunts. The movie traverses through a wafer-thin plot and yet
manages to keep you on the edge of seat with some of best stunts. Screenplay does falter in few places but I will not complain as Extraction kept me glued to the screen for 1 hour 56 mins.This is a movie for those people who love action films and should be respected as each and every choreography is worth clapping. The movie goes very
well with electrifying background score. Art direction is superb while Cinematography is wonderful, especially during the action scenes.
Writing by Joe Russo is engaging and does not let blink your eye for a minute.Tyler Rake could only be played by one and the only Chris Hemsworth. The actor not only emotes well with his expression but is
fantabulous with his hand combat and action stunts. I loved Randeep Hooda as he brings in spark once he enters the scenes. Rudhraksh Jaiswal
and Golshifteh Farahani were good in their part while Pankaj Tripathi has one just scene in the film.Overall, if you are in need for some kick-ass action film, Extraction is the right dose for you. Electrifying 3.5/5","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It came to my mind, so I watched it. And it was pretty entertaining. I was surprised by how quickly things went into gear in this film; it went straight into it.This film had notable aspects, and they also helped the film, as a whole, stand on its feet. But there were also other things; they weren't ""bad,"" but I can see why other people would look at them negatively. And while I say ""things,"" that's me being thorough, accounting for ""everything"" because there probably are other things that some people didn't like about this film. I only noticed one.There wasn't much of a plot. Plain and simple. It's pretty straightforward, easy to follow, and that, something with barely any substance, was turned into an entire film. Of course, most people probably expected that, and others weren't surprised. This film: action film, through and through. I didn't care, but I can understand why that would be a ""bad thing"" to some people.The biggest highlight of this film was by far the action sequences. They were well done: and if they weren't, this film would've flopped. It had nothing else going for it, although who knows how different it would've been if it wasn't an action film. But, as what it was, an action film, the action, being well done, saved it. They made up for any lackluster areas throughout the film. Those involved in the creation of this film understood the assignment. And they delivered. The core of this film was the action: nothing more, nothing less.Its second-biggest highlight, I'd say, was the camera work. It was creative. Usually, something like that never sticks out to me. There were instances where you'd realize it even if you couldn't care less about something like that, aka me. But it was well done and added a lot to the experience. Now, combine that with the choreography and direction of the action sequences: you're in the film.The score was also good. I'm pretty sure I read someone bringing up Inception. I was thinking of scores you'd hear in the Modern Warfare video games, and I suppose that kind of sound is pretty similar to scores by Hans Zimmer. So, that tracks. Yet it wasn't that identical-sounding, just reminiscent. Henry Jackman and Alex Belcher give it a distinctive twist.The acting was decent on all fronts. The actors who had elevated moments regarding that were Chris Hemsworth, Rudhraksh Jaiswal, and Randeep Hooda. The latter of which was the highlight for me. Not only that, his character was on par with Chris's character and brought most of the excitement to the film alongside each other.The cinematography was good in some areas with good shots. At the same time, I feel like it was lacking. More specifically, lacking ""something."" I feel like it looked too bleak and grainy sometimes, and it's 100% not because of India being the primary filming location. With good cinematography comes making something somewhat subpar looking into something good looking; making something already good looking into something even better looking. It seems like Newton Thomas Sigel had his work cut out for him. But he also came up short.Regarding positives and negatives, I guess this film is half-and-half. But the most important thing to note is that the positives are radiant. So having said that, I don't think the negatives were that impactful on the film and certainly not on its enjoyment. At least for me.This film is by no means one of the best films ever. But it gets the job done/it got the job done. It was thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable to watch, and I look forward to the second film. I hope it's even better, especially the action sequences.Here are my other thoughts:","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Set out in the dense dim dusty dhaka city, the films has achieved in complementing the terrific actions scenes. But these scenes run along without a strong storyline. There are so many plot holes you'll be able to notice right from the beginning of the movie. Major scenes fail to explain the proper reason behind them. Introduction of unnecessary characters in between hinting the producer's need of making a two hour movie.
The action sequences are outstanding, it actually felt that you are a part of the scenes. ( credits director)
The action director has gained all stars and the scriptwriters have lost it all.
Pankaj tripaathi role is too short for his calibre. The abilities of randeep hooda shown in the movie questions the whole existence of Chris Hemsworth in the movie.

This is all about action. There are some truly jaw-dropping scenes in this movie, including the much talked about near-12-minute single-take scene.
My biggest issue with the movie was the dialogue audio. The mixing on this movie wasn't great. You crank up the volume to try and hear what the actors are saying and then the audio from the action blows you from your seat. It distracts and makes it difficult to follow some of the scenes. Even the quiet ones. They also could have trimmed the 2 hour run time a bit to keep it moving.

The movie is based on saving a hostage from Bangladesh. A boy called Ove, who was kidnaped by the most significant drug Diller Amir Asif in Bangladesh and India. The main character was Chris Harmsworth. The base of operation was held in Australia. The movie has extreme violence and lots of action which I liked most. The sound and combat seem realistic. I notice that the filer looks like gloomy according to Bangladeshi culture. They should have added a better filter for a better look; in the movie mercenary Tyler Rake (Chris Harmsworth) as known as an Agent who visits Puran-Dhaka, Bangladesh. The Landmarks, Environment, culture, people everything was realistic. A stranger came with a van and they said to him, 'welcome to Dhaka'. Those people kidnap him and he knew that he has lots of money. But they didn't know that he was a secret agent. He got an escape from the mafia. That action of the agent was so aggressive and enjoyable. But I that time I saw that children with Asselt Rifle and they acting like a terrorist. That was so annoying to see this too me. In the middle of escape with Ove, that was massive action. From the operation base, they were asking Tyler Rake for the drive location. The Police were chasing their car and keep shooting their vehicle. The car crashes were fantastic. Then he entire a building elite team was searching that place. The stealth kill was so perfect in that place. The 12 minutes of this action was so interested in me. The entire sequence consists of a car chase, then a pursuit up some stairs, a fight in a building, a jump from one rooftop to another rooftop, a tumble off an awning, a flight in the street, a fight in the road, and one final of car chase which amounts to about 36 different segments attached together, creating an I, pressure 12 minutes seemingly continuously scene. One thing I notice that Police with badge written Army soldiers again wearing RAB's dress. This is really weird to me. The forces showed that they were bots (Unskilled). But the developer should have research more before making this movie.
The accent was not a regional language. Those accents seem like from the west bangle. As a Bangladeshi fan, the Bengali wasn't mush infested. Children speak about toxic behavior. A maximum vehicle like trucks, old model cars are from India. The lighting was low than editing. But overall, the movie has massive actions and also like the camera angle. Hope, If Netflix announces Extraction 2 in Bangladesh, then again welcome to our country. Overall, Impressive action scenes, a talented cast, fabulous direction from Sam Hargrave, and a brilliant screenplay from Joe Russo all these add up to the awesomeness of Extraction. Even though the plot was a bit confusing and the ending was predictable, Extraction is indeed good enough to put a smile on your face.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Same notion is valid even in the field of entertainment. If a movie is released by a well-known studio or an actor, there is a standard that it is expected to meet. Thus, when Chris Hemsworth partnered with Netflix to release Extraction on April 24th, there was a certain expectation from this film & I think it's fair to say that it fell short.Extraction is an action-drama set in Bangladesh in which Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), who plays the role of a courageous mercenary, is hired for a perilous extraction in which he has to rescue the kidnapped son of Ovi Mahajan Sr (Pankaj Tripathi), an international criminal. Things start to take a wrong turn for Rake when there is a glitch in the plan and he is left stranded with Ovi Mahajan (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) after rescuing him from the kidnappers. What follows is a 60-minute non-stop action drama following Rake's journey to rescue Mahajan with the help of Saju (Randeep Hooda).Be it Billy Lee in 'Bad Times at the El Royale' or Captain Mitch Nelson in '12 Strong', Chris Hemsworth is one of the few actors who has been able to continuously deliver notable performances outside of Marvel Studios. His performance in Extraction is one of such notable instances. Hemsworth is also supported well by Jaiswal who, despite being only 3 films old, looks completely in his element while sharing the screen with the mighty Thor. Hooda also delivers a convincing performance as an alibi of Tripathi and risks his life for the safety of Mahajan. For all Stranger Things fans, you also see a nice little cameo by David Harbour as Gaspar.Extraction is the testimony of Hemsworth's effort to keep growing as a filmmaker as this feature marks his debut as a producer in films. Speaking of debut, Extraction is also the directorial debut of Sam Hargrave, who is known for his stunts in Avengers: Endgame, Avengers: Infinity War, Deadpool 2, and many other action movies. One could see Hargave's signature all over this movie with dangerously yet immaculately performed stunts - especially in one action sequence that goes on for 11 minutes in which Rake is trying to save Mahajan from the cops and Saju. Hargrave mentioned in his interview that it took him 5 months to create that scene and 10 days to shoot it. Hargrave also clarified that although it looks like a one-long scene from a naked eye, it is actually a compilation of many scenes digitally plastered together.Although the acting, cinematography, production design and stunts are good in this movie, the script doesn't do justice. There are several sub-plots in the movie that are left undiscovered and even the ending demands a little more clarification. Because of its starcast and the current 'stay-at-home' order, this movie will garner more eyeballs than it would have otherwise. But if you are busy pursuing a hobby or have limited disposable time for watching content, you can give this movie a pass.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie is focused on tight, almost claustrophobic combat, long cuts and good to follow action. It feels cliche to say similar to John Wick but it is in some ways. The movie is not interested in massive explosions and set pieces like Mission Impossible or the Fast and Furious franchises. One action scene in particular was amazing. All action scenes were enjoyable.The ending let it down for me a little, but it is still worth a watch if you're looking for a good fun action movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

For the love of action, genre watch it!!!. This movie has taken so much in account from John Wick which in my opinion which is the god of all the action movies. All those beautifully choreographed action sequences and long takes are just a treat for an eye. What this movie lacks is a story as it has the same clichéd story. But even after having this flaw, it is still a joy to watch with fantastic direction by Sam Hargrave. Even the acting by the cast is quite good with everyone playing their roles with proper conviction.

But since Chris Hemsworth is in the movie, it's a win-win. the film has a cliched plot that we've seen a ton of times. Interestingly, it takes it and does something different with it. The cinematography is average and the hand to hand combat is absolutely the best I've seen. One really outstanding scene from this film is the long 11-minute long take in one of the action sequences. Of course, it's actually simulated but they probably put it there for a reason. Another worthy aspect of Extraction is the acting performance by Chris Hemsworth. He is really great in the film and works. The complaints I have are the plot and feel of the film. It has that filter of a Mexican movie. Now there are some complaints about the violence being over the top. I didn't mind it since I have seen films that are more violent than this one. Overall, Extraction is an enjoyable action film that you can watch during the quarantine. It will just be another of those films that we forget throughout the week.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

As he slumps behind a vehicle with shots being fired around him, his mind goes back, we see a blurred vision, of what looks like a little child on a beach. The story then cuts from that scene and goes back to explain, how and why Tyler is in this condition.
We see a teenage Indian boy, Ovi Mahajan (played by Rudhraksh Jaiswal) with his friends. He looks like your average teenager, hanging out with his friends. You can see that he is of a wealthy family. He sneaks out of his home to meet his friends at a club,While out one boy he is with gets shot and a hood is placed over Ovi's head.
We then find out that this is a kidnapping. Ovi's father a Mumbai crime lord, serving time in prison, but he main rival Amir Asif (played by Priyanshu Painyuli) has orchestrated it all and will use Ovi as a pawn to get what he wants. Amir runs the underworld of weapons, drugs and trafficking in Bangladesh. So where does Tyler Rake feature? The next scenes show Tyler being commandeered and offered the mission of the ""extraction"" of Ovi. You see Tyler is a black market mercenary. The mission is offered to him by Nik Khan (played by Golshifteh Farahani), who is also a mercenary. She describes the mission to Tyler as, the most deadly ""extraction"" of his career. Does he get to Ovi?
This movie was OK, to be honest i expected a little more. Its A Chris Hemsworth Action Thriller! Don't get me wrong, the movie is full of action and is a thriller, but seemed to be missing something. Car chases, gun fights, knife fights, you got it, the story-line was feasible too. I don't know? Do i now expect amazing films from Chris Hemsworth? Am i expecting too much? I don't think i am! He has come to be known as a very good actor and in Netflix high budget movie, i wasn't as blown away as i think I should have been, especially as its screen-writer was veteran Marvel Comic guru, Joe Russo.
Still worth a watch for you car chasing, gun wielding action fans.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Maybe its not the first time but certainly its one of the more notable times, where Bollywood and Hollywood collaborate, on what is, a functional action flick.""Extraction"" has lots of points of comparison but probably the most obvious is military action series ""Strike Back"". A Sky series that's been a roaring success. Why? Because this film, like the series, adhere's to its military action formula.This is a simple film, that's essentially a well rehearsed and choreographed, mercenary ""run and gun"" affair. Its exposition driven, frenetic and pyrotechnically elaborate.Its back story is basic too yet still has enough heart felt moments to actually be touching. Better still, it makes no effort to over moralise. Really there are no perfect outcomes, as is typically the way, in the world we all live in.Decent acting and solid cast choices from the East and West, round things out.A simple but entertaining winner.8/10 from me.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"7","/10","""We just got attacked by the goonies from hell.""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9144459/?ref_=tt_urv","gettodamoofies","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur150414589/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2023","FILM: 6.5/10.Extraction is a straightforward, unapologetic action flick that, despite its paper-thin characters and occasionally tedious runtime, manages to entertain with its well-choreographed action sequences. As I settled into my seat, I braced myself for a predictable storyline, and unfortunately, the film doesn't deviate far from that expectation. Joe Russo, known for his work on Avengers: Endgame, provides a generic screenplay that lacks depth and originality. However, I couldn't deny that I had fun watching the gruesome violence unfold.The saving grace of Extraction lies in its impressive action setpieces. Gunfights and chases abound, and the standout moment comes in the form of a more than 10-minute, one-take style car chase. The seamless camera work and inventive stunts kept me entertained on more than one occasion.Although the characters are as thin as tissue paper, Chris Hemsworth delivers a solid performance as the stoic Tyler Rake. He brings a certain intensity to the role, and there are moments where you can't help but root for him. However, it's hard to overlook the lack of depth in the supporting cast, leaving them feeling like mere plot devices rather than fully fleshed-out individuals.One aspect that surprised me was the film's seriousness. It takes itself far too seriously most of the time, which can be a bit exhausting. However, amidst the generally somber tone, there is a moment of potentially unintended dark humour. A character named Rake actually kills two guys with a rake, so there is that.In the end, Extraction is a flawed but enjoyable action film. It won't win any awards for its screenplay or character development, but if you're seeking adrenaline-pumping thrills, you'll find them here. The well-executed action sequences and Chris Hemsworth's performance make it worth a watch, even if you have to overlook its shortcomings.FORMAT: StreamingVIDEO: 9/10.Native 4K streaming presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Good, Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 10/10.Dolby Atmos streaming audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Excellent, LFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 7/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

With cinemas locked down due to the global pandemic, I had stopped waiting to watch any new movies. What caught my attention was the trailer of Extraction, that finally gave me hope to wait for a big action blockbuster. And having watched it on Netflix just minutes ago, I can assure you that it's the best action movie of the year till now. The film lived up to the hype and left me satisfied as the credits rolled.Extraction's USP is the action it offers: beautifully shot, neatly choreographed and well-edited too. Those fed up of quick cuts in recent action movies would be pleasantly surprised to find long takes in this film (in this case, a prolonged single-shot action sequence!) instead of fast cutting. The color tone is rich and suits the film's own tone. There are a couple of dramatic breaks between the action that make the viewers root for the characters.Chris Hemsworth delivers an impressive performance that gels with his character, while Rudraksh Jaiswal also presents us with a neat act. It's finally very satisfying to see Randeep Hooda doing a character like this. Make no mistake, he's done a couple of action films before but never did he play a tough character like this: one that allows him to both throw a punch and emote whenever needed.Extraction is also surprisingly realistic in terms of how it doesn't want to turn heroes into indestructible characters. When they get hit, they bleed. When they are injured, they feel pain. And given how all of this is done masterfully during its video-game style action, Extraction fulfills the action genre to its fullest. Again, since there's no way one's gonna step out and pay to buy tickets and popcorn to a movie at this moment, it's better to stay home, grab some snacks and prepare yourself for a thrill-a-minute, no-nonsense action ride called Extraction. Action aficionados are definitely in for a massive treat","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's difficult to tell who watched the entire movie as Netflix registers anyone who watched two minutes or more of a movie as a viewer. Unsurprisingly, Netflix is working on follow-ups to both ""Extraction"" and ""Birdbox.""a dystopian thriller starring Sandra Bullock which rated 89 million viewers .
I watched it because I was interested to see Chris Hemsworth in a role other than Thor and I was impressed by his performance as Tyler Rake, a fearless black market mercenary, who embarks on the most deadly extraction of his career when he's enlisted to rescue the of kidnapped son in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
Chris Hemsworth obviously believed in this film as he's one of the Producers along with Joe Russo. Extraction cost $65 million to make, and producer/screenwriter Joe Russo argues that's around double the budget they'd have landed if it had released in theaters, and been funded elsewhere.
The entire ensemble cast are all very convincing in their respective roles but standout performance for me was 15 year old (at time of filming)
Rudhraksh Jaiswal as Ovi Mahajan, the son of Indian crime lord Ovi Mahajan Sr. who is the kidnap victim. He is excellent in his role and the quality of his performance reminded me of Dev Pate's debut movie appearance in Slumdog millionaire.
Reviews have been mixed Rohan Naahar of the Hindustan Times praised the performances of Hemsworth and Hooda, and wrote: ""Featuring one of the most stunning action scenes in recent memory...
Violent thriller action films are not my favourite movie genre and believe me there is a lot of violence and blood shed in Extraction but I found it entertaining and the Action and stunt work is certainly well done and would have been even more spectacular on a proper Cinema Screen.
No wonder the film looks good it's Director Sam Hargrave an American stuntman, actor and director who is best known for his collaborations with the Russo brothers, including being the stunt coordinator for several films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe including all the Avengers films .
Script writers include Joe Russo and Anthony Russo and they keep the action moving along at a frenetic pace.
I can't say much more except after seeing Extraction I'm sure Chris Hemsworth will succeed in branching out for roles to replace Thor when he decides to put his hammer away. I've mentioned the violence ,is it excessive ? probably yes ,so if that bothers you Extraction may not be for you but perhaps like many I've become desensitised to it and I just look at it like a video game or 21st Century Cowboy film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Just good, old-fashioned, wall-to-wall action. Making the most of it's budget, cast and locations, ""Extraction"" is a relentlessly paced, crazily filmed and directed movie that is a lot of fun to watch. Which is what movies such as this are meant to be, entertaining. No fuss, no muss just pure enjoyment.Chris Hemsworth's, Tyler Rake...if there ever was a name for an action franchise character this is it. After all those annoying, anemic and frankly insulting ""Thor"" movies, Hemsworth finally gets the chance to use his physicality to the max. It is clear that he had a helluva time doing it. While he is the focal point of this movie, the rest of the cast are no slouches either. All actors are clearly committed to their roles and the movie itself.The action scenes are the heart and soul of ""Extraction"". Deservedly so. They are really breathtaking in their set-up, their sheer audacity, inventiveness and execution.It has been quite a while since I had this much fun, just sitting back, switching my brain off and watching a thoroughly entertaining movie!Though there have been over the past couple of years movies and series of this kind, like ""Extraction"", they are still rather the exception and not the norm. While this movie is not perfect, I'd rather take something like ""Extraction"" over almost anything being churned out by modern day Hollywood..","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film stars Chris Hemsworth as Tyler Rake, a former Australian soldier turned mercenary who is hired to rescue Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the son of an Indian drug lord, from a rival Bangladeshi crime boss. The film also features Randeep Hooda, Golshifteh Farahani, Pankaj Tripathi and David Harbour in supporting roles.The film is a fast-paced and violent ride that showcases Hemsworth's physical prowess and charisma as an action hero. The film boasts some impressive cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel, especially in a 12-minute long take that follows Rake and Ovi through a car chase, a shootout and a rooftop escape. The film also has a gritty and realistic tone that contrasts with the comic book origins of the story.However, the film suffers from a lack of originality and depth in its plot and characters. The film borrows heavily from other action films such as John Wick, Man on Fire and The Raid, without adding much new or innovative to the genre. The film also fails to explore the complex political and social issues that surround the setting of Dhaka, Bangladesh, and instead relies on stereotypes and clichés. The film's villains are one-dimensional and lack motivation, while the film's heroes are mostly defined by their tragic backstories and their skills with guns and knives.Overall, Extraction is a decent action film that delivers on its promise of thrilling and brutal sequences, but does not offer much else in terms of substance or originality. The film is best enjoyed by fans of Hemsworth and hardcore action enthusiasts who are not looking for anything more than a popcorn flick.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Those three, and a few others, give more than solid performances but I don't feel like they are anything extraordinary - mainly due to other factors.That also matches how I feel about the action. I enjoyed a lot of it in truth, a number of the deaths are pretty nicely done, though the editing/cinematography comes out odd in parts... yet it does still weirdly work.The set designs are something I, flat out, don't rate in 'Extraction'.

With Mahajan's assets frozen by the Indian government, Saju hatches a plan to hire mercenaries to bring back Ovi. Australian mercenary Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is brought the job by his partner Nik (Golshifteh Farahani) and they assemble a crew to head into Dhaka and extract Ovi from Amir Asif's forces. While Tyler successful rescues Ovi, the extraction is complicated as Saju betrays the team intending to kill Tyler's team and take Ovi himself. Despite the job being compromised, Tyler tries to get Ovi back to safety eluding both Amir's forces as well as Saju.Extraction is a 2020 action film produced by the prolific Russo brothers with Joe Russo having written the screenplay based on the graphic novel Ciudad he co-created with his brother Anthony and Ande Parks. The film marks the debut of veteran stunt coordinator Sam Hargrave who worked with the Russos on Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame. The movie marked the first major collaboration between the Russos and Netflix and with its massive success on the platform at one point being Netflix's most viewed movie, the two would go on to collaborate on further projects. While the movie itself is a solid technical exercise with a solid showcase or action setpieces, it's also a movie that isn't all that substantial and won't linger with you past the end credits.I will say that Chris Hemsworth is good playing a more grounded character in comparison to his previous work and in terms of dramatic work he does give a solid performance of a lost soul looking for redemption. Sam Hargrave does a good job at showcasing the intensity of the action and some sequences such as a ""oner"" chase scene done as if it were in one take. I also thought Randeep Hooda was quite good as opposite Hemsworth playing a morally ambiguous deuteragonist. The story itself is where I feel much of issues come about because whenever the action isn't happening a lot of the more dramatic moments tend to fall kind of flat. While Rudhraksh Jaiswal does what he can with the material, the line where be basically says he's a package rings a bit too true as he's not particularly rich in characterization and a major scene between him and Hemsworth just falls flat.Extraction is perfectly serviceable in terms of action entertainment, but it's also a movie that you'll be hard pressed to remember much of once the end credits roll. It's a suitable time killer, but it wasn't a movie that I was particularly engrossed in and I did find it wared on me as it went on.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I think story could have been better even if it is a action movie.
Initially, after seeing the trailer, I thought casting Indian actors like Pankaj Tripathi and Randeep Hooda was just for attracting Indian audience and they would not be given enough on screen time. But I was amazed seeing they have been acting parallel to Chris Hemsworth. Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda were amazing in the movie. I wish they would have
given a little more on screen time to Pankaj Tripathi.If you love action movies and enjoy hand to hand combat and gun-fights, you should definitely watch it, if not, still you should watch it, you will love it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Rake and Khan's team prepare to extract Ovi, with his father's men set to pay them once Ovi is recovered. Is Tyler successful? What all enemies he has to fight to bring back Ovi and do both make it back successfully is what the story covers.
There are some impressive stunt work and fantastically steroidal action sequences by both Chris Hemsworth ,Randeep Hooda(Saju) and even Golshifteh Farahani towards the end. Golshifteh as Nik looks beautiful. Randeep and Chris have some great moments of guns blazing and combat knives stabbing.with each other and against Asif's man. As action takes the centrestage the story goes for a toss as case is with most of the action series. Many would call is mindless. The movie does get tedious after an hour but quickly finds its feet once Ovi(14 yr old) kills the Gasper(David Harbour ). Yes, 14 yr old has moments as well. And, bond between the Ovi and his saviour Tyler do carry emotion so Tyler going all out for Ovi does make sense.
Though I would have loved to see backstory of Ovi Mahajan Sr(Pankaj Tripathi) and Amir Asif(Priyanshu Painyuli) for me to be fully invested into the series. Such detailing was absent and many a times you could wonder if all the bloodbath is all worth it.

I will say that the fight scene that I paused to type my thoughts so far is probably the best knife fight I can remember ever seeing in a movie so kudos for that. To bad they ended the way they did totally ruined that fight scene. Next oddity, why does this kid keep trusting Hemsworth? So we have in this story a typical troubled hero with something in his past that haunts him and drives him to make the choice that ultimately kills him but also makes him a hero. We have the innocent caught in a world he does not belong in and completely out of his element. We have the woman who loves the hero from afar and has never had the courage to act on her love. We have the trusted henchman that double crosses his boss only to be destroyed in the end. Finally we have the evil tyrants on both sides spreading hate and death for selfish reasons and greed in this case as often is the case two warring drug lords. 60 minutes, I am getting a bit bored of the same old same old. Oh my, the old friend, I just paused again, I am gonna guess that the old friend betrays him and tries to make an excuse about how he has to survive or they came to him and threatened his family or something like that. Watch it to see if I am right. 1:21 unforeseen twist, not completely unpredictable but I did not see it. Final thoughts; Randeep Hooda aka Saju is a fantastic action actor and I really enjoyed watching him in this movie and hope to find some others he is in that I can watch. Hemsworth does an admirable job of playing an operator or special forces or whatever you choose to call his past roll. We knew how the movie would end, however, that does not mean I or we should be happy about this, it was a bullstuff ending and frankly lost a star from me over the ending itself. (Yes I know this was based on someone else's work, a graphic novel, so what it is still bullstuff.)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It does have a plot, regardless of what some reviewers have written but it is definitely the action scenes that make this a 8/10 movie.
Chris Helmsworth is the lead but the directing, stunt & camera work are the stars.
Not as good as The Raid films but high octane entertainment indeed. Only wish I could've seen it on cinema sized screen.

The alleged kidnapping had no relation with what happens next; Chris Hemsworth's character could have been a deranged psychopath who kills law-enforcement officers for fun, and the movie would have remained the same. An apparently righteous hero cannot justify killing law enforcement officers who were probably just following orders. And those orders were justified too - especially after Chris Hemsworth's character killed dozens of uniforms.The trailer said it was a fight between two drug lords. We never see any of the alleged drug lords to be involved in any drug business. None of the drug lords command a big army of their own.The drug lord of Bangladesh was not believable in his role, not sure if he was a bad actor, or he simply could not pull off a foreign language.Next, there is the issue of the Dhaka city. Except for some aerial footage, none of the scenes were from Dhaka. They portrayed a city in some dirt poor country, war-ridden African country - and Dhaka did not fit the bill.Also, the movie does not show anything quintessential Dhaka - if they claimed to be taking place in Colombo, Kathmandu, or any other city - they would have to change only a few props. Moreover, no actors spoke in any Bangladeshi accent. In fact, it was obvious they were all from the Indian state of Bengal. This is why directors should not use a cultural reference without understanding it. The saddest part was, they could have hired one or two actors and screenwriters from Bangladesh, and do this better.However, no amount of cultural course correction could have made the movie better. This was the very definition of a cliche movie - which was probably fine as long as the movie did not claim to be something bigger than that. In the end, I did not even remember the name of Chris Hemsworth's character, nor the name of David Harbour's character, and I never cared for any of them.Netflix should make better investments in the future!PS: if finding Bangladeshi actors were that difficult, then they should have flipped the story. The Indian drug lord could have kidnapped Bangladeshi drug lord's son.","11 out of 23 found this helpful.

Nor is Extraction a spin-off from the highly-successful John Wick franchise, although if it is was, you wouldn't have thought twice. If anything, thinking twice is not why one would watch the Netflix original movie.Resplendent with turn-yer-brain-off action and in-yer-face fisticuffs, Extraction is the perfect prescription for fun escapism this quarantined world needs.Based on the graphic novel Ciudad by comicbook veteran Ande Parks (Capote in Kansas, Green Arrow) and Joe Russo (a screenwriter/director... somewhat of a newcomer in the field. Has a few little-seen, indie flicks on his resume...), Extraction is the straight-forward tale of a hardened-yet-weary merc hired to rescue a kidnapped boy. That boy, refreshingly played by Rudhraksh Jaiswal, whose wide, innocent eyes are more-than-reminiscent of Finn Wolfhard's Stranger Things teen exuberance, is the son of a ruthless Mumbai mobster. An equally-ruthless mobster, this one from Dhaka, Bangladesh, has the son kidnapped in order to finalize their gang war. Enter Chris Hemsworth and team whose muscles, grunts, and squinting eyes would make any paramilitary army quake in fear from their oncoming storm. In a fun little twist, once Hemsworth's team gains the child, they are brutally betrayed by the son's guardian, Saju, a former black ops solider, portrayed by action-star-in-the-making Randeep Hooda.Directed by Sam Hargrave, who worked as a stunt coordinator and second unit director on a number of Marvel movies, he follows in the footsteps of Chad Stahelski (John Wick) and David Leitch (Atomic Blonde). Showing more than hyper-stylized fight scenes, of which there are plenty, Hargrave beautifully choreographs an 11-minute, single-shot scene that even Sam Mendes (1917, Spectre) would find impressive.Hemsworth brings brunt physicality to the role as well as the requisite levels conflict. The twinkling Thunder God's eye has been replaced with a study of seriousness, which was a welcome turn following the depressing aloofness shown in his Endgame character. Most of all, Hemsworth is convincingly believable in a rather unbelievable role in a most ridiculous movie.Extraction has all the tropes of an 80s action movie. Of course, if Ovi was a blond woman there would have been the obligatory romance scene. Instead, there is the all-too short bromance between Hemsworth and David Harbour, whose affable charisma deserved longer screen time. Extraction is R-rated theater in single-minded pursuit of a single-minded goal: thoughtless entertainment. With that, Netflix has extracted a win.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Powerful performances and tight scripting take tired clichés and make them feel like tried-and-true storytelling techniques. (Most of the time.) This could have been just a fun, disposable genre pasttime, but it's significantly better than that.Chris Hemsworth reveals himself to be a gifted craftsman through an understated, gripping performance. It's refreshingly un-self-conscious, and delivered humbly, without flash or fanfare. It's the mark of a smart director that he was given the space to do that. In those quiet moments, with his fierce, but anguished, weary eyes, he really made me believe his spiritual desolation. On reflection, it reminds me of Denzel Washington, who also elevates more than one action movie with hard-wrung pathos. I hope Hemsworth is allowed to continue on this track and do meatier work than he's been saddled with up to now.His isn't the only impressive performance. David Harbour is delightful in a thankless, but crucial bit part. What a presence that guy has. Rudhraksh Jaiswal shows up big time in that last act. Most kid actors aren't nearly that good. If there's any justice, he has a good career ahead of him, as does the startlingly adept first-time feature director Sam Hargrave. He doesn't quite sidestep all of the pitfalls of a movie like this (lots of side characters we don't have time to care about, some on-the-nose flashback material, etc.), but the way he choreographs motion, viscera, and heart is impressive.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Now, that's not to state that Extraction is a bad film. It's pretty enjoyable, the actors are quite good, and it has well-executed action. Unfortunately, the film's flaws drag it down, resulting in its forgetfulness and averageness.
Now, the film nails the emotional bits. These characters are likable just from the start of the film, thanks to the writers establishing our connection with them using a few effective scenes, and doubled with great performances from the actors, an array of great protagonists are created.
Unfortunately, the script fails in terms of originality, as the story follows familiar beats as other films, therefore diminishing the element of surprise. The film's side characters are often underdeveloped and underused, for example, Jake Tyler's boss. She gets more crucial to the story as it goes on, but it feels like the writers aren't interested in fleshing her out, as we get glimpses of her past, her relationship with the main protagonist, and more so, but these traits are ignored, leaving a caricature of a character.
Also, the action gets stale quite soon as it doesn't change throughout the whole film.
Finally, this film could be so much better, if it could focus more on either the characters or the action, instead of attempting to do both.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Who doesn't love Chris Hemsworth? He's one of those guys men want to be and women want to be with. He has great screen presence and he just seems like a likeable guy,The movie has a ton of action and the fight scenes are at a John Wick-ish level for production, choreography and execution. The opening sequence where Hemsworth's character rescues the young boy and kills like a dozen men is filmed at close quarters, is very fast paced and is hilariously violent. The camera jumps around the scene so you get different angles.Hemsworth plays Tyler Rake, a depressed, burnt out former special forces soldier turned mercenary. He is hired to ""extract"" the 14-year old son (a very good Rudhraksh Jaiswal) of a imprisoned drug dealer from a rival drug dealer's clutches. The movie is set in India and the scenery is bleak, dirty and does not do India's reputation any favors. Once he rescues the boy, his team is ambushed and Tyler is left alone with the boy trying to navigate his way through the city to an extraction point. The father's right hand man, Saju, (an also very good Randeep Hooda) is likewise a former special forces soldier and he is tracking Tyler and the boy as well, holding his own personal motivations.David Harbor as an old friend with a safe house and Golshifteh Farahani as Tyler's handler Nik Khan are good in small roles. And that is the problem. The movie had some real potential to develop characters we care about, but it sacrifices 3D characters for action and violence. Tyler and Saju are two sides of the same coin, but that isn't explored very well other than a few quick scenes of their families. Nik is a bad ass supporting character, but her role is just yelling Tyler's name into a radio most of the time, until the end climax and epilogue. There is no sense of history between them...or between any of the characters. This movie had some pretty decent talent involved and it just felt wasted to make room for more action. When characters died, I didn't care because I had no emotional investment in these people.As I said the action scenes are superb. The scene of Tyler and Ovi racing through a rundown apartment complex chased by a slew of soldiers, police and gangsters is filmed in several very long takes and the camera is so close to the action you almost feel the punches. The fight that culminates this scene between Tyler and Saju is as good as anything in John Wick. Its a highlight of the film.A good movie that could have been great had it spent some more time on its characters. Still, I enjoyed it and look forward to Hemsworth's next project.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"1","/10","Totally wrong representation of Dhaka City.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5670960/?ref_=tt_urv","faridazad-72498","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117257917/?ref_=tt_urv","24 April 2020","I am extremely disappointed with the HORRIBLE misrepresentation of Dhaka. Dhaka and its law enforcers deserve a MUCH better portrayal in front of the world. Reasons below:
1. Children don't carry rifles on the streets of Dhaka in broad daylight. It's a horrible misrepresentation shown in the movie. If I didn't live in Dhaka myself, I would be mistaken into thinking child terrorism is normal in Dhaka.2. Law enforcers in Dhaka - whether it be DMP, RAB or any of the defense organizations - are NOT incompetent and incapable of stopping two random guys flying in from outside the country. They do their job well, which is why we can go out, visit places, hang out with friends and more without worrying about random shootings (like they show in the movie).3. Dhaka's streets are NOT violent and it's NOT normal for people to fight in public with guns and swords. The movie made it seem like the people are used to things like these happening and somehow it's the norm here.4. An entire movie set to be in Dhaka and not a SINGLE major Bangladeshi character played by someone who SPEAKS the language and dialect that we do in Bangladesh? Are you for real, Netflix? All the major characters spoke Bengali like they do in West Bengal / Kolkata - NOT how we speak in Bangladesh - although they were representing characters in Bangladesh. Why? My mother was an actress, a lot of my friends are too. I'm sure many Bangladeshi actors could do those roles better than any of the ones who did, WHILE speaking our language/dialect.Overall, it's a horrible misrepresentation of the country in front of the world by a cast which isn't even 1% Bangladeshi. People abroad don't know a whole lot about Dhaka, but after they watch this movie, they might get the wrong impression that Dhaka lacks law enforcement and is filled with violence.This is not my Dhaka, this is not any Dhaka.PS: This is my opinion on the movie, as someone who was actually born and brought up in Dhaka. I was offended by how they represented my city, and I want an apology from Netflix.","14 out of 31 found this helpful.

Dhaka looks like any third world country and with Hindi songs blaring out, and the Hindi style spoken bangla, it feels an Indian city and not a Bangladeshi city.
Anyhow, the drug and mafia interplay and the country's top military and police brass in cohorts, tries to give a police state with a nexus much similar to African countries. The story backdrop of kidnapping and rescuing is okay, but there is no build up.
The dhaka ganglord is totally unbelievable. He is not menacing at all.
The child actors are better and natural. Specially the slum dwelling would be one and the kidnapped kid.
Liked the Randeep huda versus Chris fighting, but the final crossing over in the bridge with huge lots of random killing and blasts are just mindless, because of lack of empathy and focus.
I hope better movies will come out with more audience involvement and focussed screeplay instead of random blasts like video games.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Both the character of Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda were great in their fights.The accuracy is what is I believe at 60%. The location is picked as Dhaka, especially around the Buriganga river. We have the involvement of Dhaka Police, the military, and another government force known as ""Elite"", which closely resembles the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB) of Bangladeshi Armed Forces. Most of their clothes were accurate to a good degree, but when I look at the faces of the actors, including the Commander of the ""Elite"" force, they feel alien to me. Their faces did not feel familiar with the minute characteristics of Bangladeshi people, including facial structure, body structure among others, which made it feel unnatural. I'd say if possible, they should've taken some Bangladeshi actors or background crew to make it look more realistic.The way the characters were talking was also borderline grey as some dialogues felt natural to the way some of the goons speak, especially the kids. But at the same time, the style of talking of the older characters felt more close to something from West Bengal Bengali rather than the Bengali from Dhaka, which we colloquially call, ""Dhakaiya Bangla"".In conclusion, movie felt good with the action, but there were so many plot holes, as to how Ovi was kidnapped and transported, how Tyler's crew entered the country with such weapons and the logistics. All it felt was something out of a script about getting a ""package"" out, without any character development.They have done a great job setting up the environment to be as real as possible.
After all being a bengali you will love the Bangali accents in a Hollywood flim.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Sure the plot has been done many times before but its supposed to be a fun movie point blank. The action was incredible with the hand to hand combat. Chris Hemsworth and the rest of the cast did a hell of a job with this one. Movie had me on the edge of my seat. There was only very FEW MINOR things that bothered me but wasn't a big deal.Anyone who's complaining about location of the movie that it is not accurate...WHO CARES!...Its a film that takes place in a fictional setting. Its like other movies that take place in New York but is filmed in Chicago or other major cities. It doesnt always have to be on point with location. If the movie has ""No Logic"" then go watch another movie. This movie isn't supposed to bring logic its a fun fast pace action packed film. Enjoy it for what it is.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Action sequences are really impressive, transitions are amazing and seamless. During action scenes jump cuts are few and very well placed, this creates a nice flow. There are a lot of moments packed of tension and this is exactly how this kind of films should be made. The one take like scene at the beginning, required a lot of planning and care, but the result definitely pays off. Stunts artists made a wonderful job and VFX department realized amazing and very realistic effects.The story is basically non-existent, and the plot is extremely predictable. So, if you are looking for a profound screenplay, search elsewhere. I really wish that this production was a little bit more balanced. Characters are mono dimensional, not deepen at all. They are basically tropes, that I have watched many times. It is possible to create interesting and capturing narratives, while having great action. ""Atomic Blonde"" and ""John Wick 2 and 3"" are just a couple of examples. When I ""review"" a movie, I need to consider all the elements and having just technically solid and impressive scenes, does not suffice to create a captivating production. Beyond this, there is nothing more that I can really say. I gave six stars out of ten for the effort and I can understand what it took, in order to pull out certain things, but this honestly wouldn't be more than five stars.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is the screenplay that lets the film down however, with the audience at no point drawn to emotionally connect with Chris Hemsworth's lead character, mercenary Tyler Rake or the kid being rescued, Ovi Mahajan (played by a medicore Rudraksh Jaiswal)David Harbour and Pankaj Tripathi are completely wasted in their roles while Randeep Hooda shines as ex-Special Forces soldier Saju, squeezing in enough acting chops into his minimal screen time to outshine even Hemsworth. In summary-Extraction is a very ordinary, cliche plotline made watchable by some extra-ordinary action sequences!I would highly recommend the YouTube video (Link in comments) where the lead actor and the director explain their more intricate action sequences.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But there was also some mistake also which was not excepted. I think you guys are not see the actual Dhaka and the gang Cultur. When i was seting for the saw i fill like i saw a South african cultur. This is not right...
Another big noticable mistake was accent. They are speaking in an accent that's commouly used in west bengal,india. But Dhaka's people have their own accen. Which name is dhakia cotti.I think you guys fail in presenting the culture.
Thank you.

But I was amazed seeing they have been acting parallel to Chris Hemsworth. Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda were amazing in the movie.

Not only bacause it portrayed Dhaka in a wrong way, there was no story in depth, nothing thrilling, all we get to see some marvelous action stunt scenes in all over the slums in Dhaka which doesn't make any sense. No humors, nothing special and estreme yellow effects killed the least of emotions. And wherever they tried to show in Dhaka couldn't connect its audience bacause Dhaka is not like that at all. Dhaka is a megacity, its not a beautiful city but It's not a slum at all. They didn't shoot the movie in Dhaka so nothing match its actual environment. Their accents didn't match and Indian music in every home and child with shotguns also very unfamiliar in Dhaka. So what is the point of using a name of a different city from a different country when you are not able to connect even not the language. The only thing I love in the full movie is Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Huda's acting. They did their parts very well.","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

If ""Extraction"" is billed as a high-octane actioner, a lot of the stunts would remind you of old-school Bollywood. For a change, this is not so much about contemporary Hollywood CGI razzle as it is about vintage Mumbai action masala, you realise as Hemsworth bashes up packs of armed goons or engages apna Randeep Hooda in some good old knife-and-bare hands sparring.Perhaps Hemsworth, Russo and Hargrave visualised it that way. An action film that will primarily play out on mobile phones cannot hope to impress with intricate SFX wizardry. Rather loud-impact stunts, kept flowing non-stop, are good enough for what actually is -- an OTT film.""Extraction"" won't disappoint action buffs, in that sense. The film is unabashedly uni-dimensional in situations, plot and characters despite a backdrop that could have been tapped to create a smart socio-political thriller. Instead, the effort never deviates from its intention of being a loud stunt fest and little else.Joe Russo's screenplay draws from a graphic novel that he once co-authored, titled ""Ciudad"". While the drama in the book is based in the Paraguayan city of Ciudad del Este, the film transfers the story to the Bangladesh Capital city of Dhaka (incidentally, the film was originally titled ""Dhaka"", too).Driven by the clear intention of cashing in on violence, Russo hasn't bothered to check much on the subcontinent's socio-cultural nuances (so typically Hollywood, isn't it). The thing is Ahmedabad simply does not look like Dhaka, never mind the deliberately done Bengali hoardings and occasional Bengali lines - in Bangaal dialect -- thrown in.Clearly, stunt director-turned-film director Hargrave gave more attention to a highlight 12-minute action sequence filmed on Hemsworth than storytelling details. The irony is the particular sequence brings back instant recall of Daniel Craig's by-now classic parkour chase in ""Casino Royale"". Even though that one came 14 years ago, it would still seem the hands-down winner in this stream of action sequences even today.
The plot is basic. Ovi (Rudraksh Jaiswal), the teenage son of a jailed drug lord (Pankaj Tripathi in a blink-and-miss role) is kidnapped by the gangster Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli). Hemsworth as the mercenary Tyler Rake is hired for a whopping sum to bring the boy back.""Extraction"" is sketchy in its intent and execution. The drama operates on a nebulous kidnapping that is never explained. It's almost as if Joe Russo, before writing this screenplay, saw too many of those old Hindi action dramas of the eighties and nineties where you normally threw logic behind while setting up the hero as a portrait of machismo.Indeed, Tyler the hero goes to places where even Thor the superhero wouldn't imagine -- in the domain of the hardcore commercial Bollywood. He acquires infallible swag as he bashes up a dozen baddies singlehandedly, and spectacularly goes about with his mission. Oh, and he is lonely, too -- as brooding men of action normally are. Just for the heck of it, they might have given Hemsworth a love story too, and some naach-gaana!Pankaj Tripathi is wasted, Randeep Hooda gets a few scenes of note as an action star, and those who dig world cinema will be disappointed with the raw deal Golshifteh Farahani gets. Hemsworth fans won't be disappointed, though. It is a package tailormade for the hunky superstar -- it is his co-production, after all.Since it is time of lockdown viewers gonna enjoy this cause it contains action and a bit of drama.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Most accurate depiction of India","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9159509/?ref_=tt_urv","dembow","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur7230778/?ref_=tt_urv","1 July 2023","Intense action with exceptional combat scenes is the main focus of this film. However, what also stands out is the detailed backdrop that stays true to life to locations and atmosphere of being in India. Whether intentional or not, the director shines at capturing realistic moments of sweaty and dirty population, to the point where you can almost feel the scent of their stench. Absolute chaos that dominates the culture of their entire nation, with no traffic rules apparently, is clearly shown here in different outdoor scenes. This ultimately results in many pleasant moments watching Chris Hemsworth butchering men (and slapping kids) in entertaining close combat scenes and utilizing the already filthy environment to put them out of their misery. Director was bold to caption the actual location and not opt out for some fictional place, but it's not like the audience wouldn't recognize the country. It's refreshing to see an accurate depiction of India, which is usually a far cry from reality in Bollywood films. You will squirm at the stinky atmosphere that almost oozes out from your TV screen and will later feel like you need a shower once it's all over. Great camera work plays a major role in high octane action scenes that takes you on a rollercoaster as Chris powers through disposable cast. I know I will definitely watch this film again.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The action is, for the most part, pretty impressive.
There's one sequence that is one long take and it's by far the best moment in the movie (if you can overlook the painfully obvious hidden cuts).Chris Hemsworth's performance is alright, but his character is not memorable or likeable.
David Harbour shows up towards the middle and he's really good, but he's gone far too quickly.
The kid that plays Hemsworth's rescue target is really not good. He's suposed to be scared for most of the movie, but he just looks confused.It's a bore and it sucks, which is a shame, because there could be a good movie buried in here, somewhere.It also kinda, sorta, maybe sets up a sequel?
Which is wierd.","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

A very enjoyable, action packed rescue film that will blow you away. In addition to solid performances and great action, much of the movie is filmed on a single mobile camera which manages to really make the viewer a part of the adventure. Hemsworth is about as tough and exciting an action star as ever existed, but he can play to the heart strings as well. The cast is so solid and fun to watch.

The action film takes place over a two-day period, so how much plot can be developed? So yeah, the movie is action packed, and the plot does revolve around the action as much as 48 hours typically allow.Some of the action scenes are pretty amazing and original. New actors not typically seen on US screens also adds originality for the American viewers. And Chris Hemsworth has strong performance during the action scenes and while taking a pause now and then. Do miss his comic side, though.I think if you expect seeing an action flick, you will not be disappointed.

I was surprised at how much screen time and dialogue was given to even non significant characters, giving the world more flesh and mind. It was so well written and shot that even a few lines gave insight to the mind of the characters. Even better, I loved how the story focused on non-Western characters whose actors all brought freshness to their respective roles, making an old penny shine new. No one takes anything sitting down and makes no apologies. Overall, stellar movie with great commentary on organized crime life-style in Desi countries.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Set in Bangladesh this movie rocks, a gangsters kid gets kidnapped and Hemsworth the mercenary has to save the day. Great shootouts, lovely locations, average script, but it's hardcore action near on par with great international movies like the Raid.
I congratulate the director and scriptwriters for leaving the politics out. I never was a fan of Hemsworth because he was married to that nasty piece of work Miley Cyrus. But now he's got rid of that feminist wrench his career is reborn, he really delivered as the tough guy, real solid performance, he's back in the big time.
Lastly, the libtards will be pulling their hair out about this movie, so you gotta support it then just to drive them nuts. :)","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is not to say action is the only thing it provides, the story isn't non existent, it's just hidden. They don't go off on dialoge giving backstory, they convey it through the actions of characters and emotion. The context of the storyline is admittedly abit lacking but i think and hope they will cover this in a later release. A second movie is already in production. The story is a tool to create a satisfactory experience paired with the action. With this insight i believe the existing story is more than sufficient while also makeing one long for more.This movie is not ment to be a representation of the modern world, it's a fictional world that exists to convey the film. So judging the quality of the movie upon what music they listen to in one building in Bangladesh is irrelevant. Misrepresenting details about Bangladesh is not important when you have the entire Bengali police force helping the biggest druglord in their country kill an Australian man trying to save a teenager. Talk about realistic. Just beacuse a movie isn't classed as sci-fi dosn't mean you should expect a documentary. The ""based on real life"" trope is played out, we need more creative film expression like this.90% of the people condemning this movie are either Bengali who were expecting seeing their uncle herding animals or people who didn't follow the story. If i wanted entertaining drama I'd have read a book instead or watched reality TV. Personally there's enough drama in my real life already, so much so that i might want to watch a satisfying action movie as an outlet and distraction from todays world events. Oh wait i already did that when i watched this movie.If the sequal gives that contextual sadisfaction this would be a strong 10, For now it's a great set up for that, sitting at a 9.5.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Action is intense.Only thing I didn't like the snap forward to end, shown at beginning of the film. It didn't work for this one... seemed pointless. There needs to be a reason for it.But, other than that, kudos! I look forward to seeing Chris in other films.

Before I begin my review, on behalf of the more literate Bangladeshi's, I apologize for the bad reviews, please ignore the natives, they haven't even watched the movie, they're willfully putting in bad reviews just because they feel the Bangladeshi army was shown in poor light and that the environment doesn't look anything like Dhaka. But the fact is that, the army is indeed incompetent and highly corrupt. The plot doesn't take place within the city but on the outskirts, this literally proves the fact that they haven't watched the movie. The people putting in bad reviews should be ashamed of themselves, it's so easy to put in bad reviews. If you'll go through the reviews you'll easily know that most of them are just hate reviews without any legit reason. I made an account just to come in support for the people who have made this project a reality.The movie is a Gem, one of the best action films of the decade. I cannot believe this was out for Netflix, it truly deserves a big if not a huge screen. The first half of the movie is non-stop, literally breathless action. The hand to hand combat scenes were on par with the RAID films! I never thought I'd say this, atleast not so soon. They've pushed the limits as much as they could. The car chases in the outskirts of the city were shot extremely seamlessly and choreographed with unbelievable precision. The vfx and sound design is astoundingly neat and crisp, again wasn't really expecting it to be so damn good. The muzzle flares and gun shot effects were on point and as realistic as they could get. The editing is so clean you'll never know the transitions between the takes.
Sam Hargrave, the director, is truly a master of his craft. He knew exactly what he was doing. There's a long extended action scene or a (Oner) which I don't want to spoil for anyone, it's probably the best one-take action sequences I've witnessed in a long time. You think John Wick and Atomic Blonde had cool slick action, wait till you watch this movie. There's some meaty stuff in here for Action nerds and the kind of gun-fu I haven't seen before. You will never be able to anticipate the moves. The stunt choreography was so meticulously and precisely designed, I cannot fathom the level of expertise it would have taken for them to have practised the whole sequence, to remember every move and have executed them in such a precise manner, is so f**king impressive. This is some premium stuff right here. Chris has done all the stunts and combat scenes by himself which is highly commendable. There's a lot of hard work that's gone behind this project and it is clearly visible. Indian actor Randeep Hooda has also done a commendable job especially during the action sequences and that one ridiculously stunning knife fight.
Loved Hemsworth's emotional performance as well, he's a big mean beast with a soft heart and it shows. With this movie Chris Hemsworth can well and truly join the big leagues of pure action movie stars. Not that he wasn't one before, but the stuff he's done in this film is particularly spectacular. I cannot wait for a sequel or even another project from Hargrave. He had my curiosity, but now he's definitely got my attention. There should be more support in favour of projects such as these. I think this is by far the best Action original from Netflix. Do yourself a favour by not missing it. What else are you doing in the lockdown anyway? Totally worth a re-watch.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

That boy is Ovi Mahajan (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the son of a jailed Indian drug lord (Pankaj Tripathi). The one-man rescue operation is Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth).Ovi was kidnapped by Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli), Bangladesh's biggest drug lord, who also controls the country's police and military,in Dhaka. Ovi, who lives in Mumbai with his father's underling, Saju (Randeep Hooda) who was in Indian Special Forces before,who knows a team that can bring the boy back to India.Tyler reaches the kidnapper's den: we get a longish violent showdown. Ovi and Tyler manage to escape: we get an even longer action set piece. The climax is expectedly more violent, where all the characters converge with an assortment of weapons.In the worst sceniario when things get complicated,all the world want Tyler to leave Ovi in Dhaka to save himself,he ensures Ovi that he will leave Dhaka only with Ovi though he will not get the money as he does not want to loss another child's life after losing his own child who was died by cancer.From then it was purely action sequence like car chasing in congested areas of Dhaka,fighting with cops,escaping from the guards etc with very limited story line.Based upon rural areas of Dhaka,it shows the effective power of Drug lord on the country's Security forces,Child labour including training them with varieties of heavy weapons from very young age to be extremist.From here on,someone attacks, someone counterattacks, someone monitors and plans.Screenplay by Joe Russo was good though the shots were too yellowish to show the impact of the rurality of Dhaka.When it comes to individual performances,Chris Hemsworth was outstanding at action sequences,dialogue delivering(specially those Bengali word ""Proman Dao"").The boy(Rudhrash) was equally good in screen but Randep Hooda as Saju was exceptional,his dedication towards the whole screenplay was fabulous,he hardly has left any fault to criticize.However for a pure entertainment and Action sequence adventure,You can surely give it a watch.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

How the scenery & the accent taking from Kolkata (an Indian City) represents Bangladesh! That's totally non-sense, more India is a country, always tries to downgrade its neighboring country specially Bangladesh.
There is no such type of terrorism in Bangladesh, militancy is strictly controlled by legal authority.

His first long picture and he's teaching the best how to shoot an action flick! Boy, what a directorial debut. That's some smooth camera work! At last, a director who turns the camera into the direction of the action! For example when the camera is nicely tucked in the backseat during a car scene and makes for some amazing shots. Don't forget the fight during the extraction! Especially the scenes in the apartment block where the camera follows a cop entering the compound during the pursuit. At one point it's too much! Agreed. But it's too much finely executed. It could've been better storywise. Yes of course, especially the ending. All that being said I can't wait for his next film. With all the bad movies shot these days I just hope Hollywood realizes this guy is a gem. Get him a great script and let him roll. He'll be fine.

If you're a bit jaded by the Hollywood obsession for more and more improbable And overblown action scenes in movies of the genre you'll enjoy this film.
There isn't a ton of story but those few moments had some real depth and were exceptionally well acted.
Definitely worth a watch.

The camera developing shots where amazing and Newton Thomas Sigwa and his team killed it
3. The lighting is amazing,it was cinematic and soft,my favorite scene was the scene where Tyler rake and Ovi mahajan were having the conversation In the room,that lighting is the best in have seen in recent times,I just want to kiss the lighting team.4. The sound,so sweet,I mean,the scene where Tyler,ovi and the police men where moving from room to room,the music choices and the feel was so nice,I loved the sound experience.5. The editing and color grading was so nice,I felt the emotion in every frame.6. I loved the boundary reach,the audiences they would get will be great,because they told their story and made a great film,I loved the fact that the camera stayed on some shots and enhanced on the use of children in crime in some societies,I really felt that.7. Now the casting And acting,how do you manage to get it all right,I am so thrilled,well you did your home work. Every character worked,the stunt was great,I loved the use of pain,I mean the mirror shot where Saju fixed his nose 👃 ...aaarrrrgh

I noticed they had 23 producers,23 Assitant directors just to mention but a few,all I saw was collaboration team work and shared profit.I am excited,super excited,if you have made a feature length film or let's say,a short film,then you will appreciate every frame that you watch👏","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

His most famous role, Thor, is heroic, funny, jokey. Tyler is dark, brooding, fearless and Hemsworth brings that very well.Great fast paced non stop action; well worth watching!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Three playing time is quite long (almost 2 hours) but I did not feel it at all. The story is simple. The action is intense and fluid, the coreography is interesting. Only few lines delivered between the non-stop actions but they are well written (and let's face it: who wants a complicated story and endless talking in a straightforward action movie?) Chris Hemsworth is good as the mercenary, also the other actors gives solid performance.

It's just an imaginary dhaka shown in the film. A movie bringing together India and Bangladesh in a context, could have been pretty good. There could have been some efforts showing some degree of corruption or systemic error that leads to the actions.But this film is just full of ****. The actions are awesome. If the film realised that the host country has much more to offer then depicted, could have made the film worth watching. Rather, the entire film is shot at , what, 500 metres of set. Everything is repetitive.And there can be no country where the military is run by Mafia. That is absurdity to the highest. Sure there can be some corruption at some level, but that should not attribute all. Remember, winter soldier? Corruption was there. But there was a conflict with the good within Hydra.In this film, there was no corruption. Nothing. Just people swinging AK47. Guns are illegal in the country. How come so many AK 47 there on the street, why would kids be carrying guns? What was the director thinking?Think about it. If you a bunch of mercenaries start shooting missiles and gunning down police without any showing any intention to discuss anything, that depicts terrorism isn't it? Then who is the bad guy here? The police or Chris? What is the logic?Watching the full movie, I did not get any sense of any hatred between the two rival gangs. It's just pointless shooting.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

Hemsworth is excellent here & gives a fantastic tough as hell performance as troubled mercenary Tyler Rake & he's one extremely deadly & well trained Black market mercenary with a nothing to lose attitude & a fearless warrior instinct, a great character. Tyler has been hired to find & rescued a kidnapped boy who is held for ransom but the kid is the son of a crime lord. This is set in the dangerous & violent underworld city of Bangladesh & the action is bone crunching, frantic, gritty & full of realism. The town is locked down & full of gangs out hunting for Tyler & the boy (a good performance by Rudhrakish Jaiswal) & these two are ferociously hunted by not just the criminals of the ghettos but also by a deadly Assassin played by Randeep Hooda, a fantastic performance & one hell of a great character who is just as good as Chris Hemsworth here!!!I loved the scary & dangerous atmosphere & the frantic explosive action that bursts out of nowhere & makes everything feel on edge & intense. An exciting survival Thriller that feels real & intense as hell. A wild thrilling ride with great performances & gory blood soaked action.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The movie represented that Dhaka is a city of drugs and crimes. It showed that DMP, Bangladesh Army, and even Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) are working for the Drug Lord of Dhaka. Using all these three Defence Forces working for the Drug Lord was an insanely bad idea. They could have used one instead of all three. It felt like Dhaka is a dark city where killing people is a normal thing on the street during daylight. Just like Mexico.2. In the movie, the director used kids to shoot gun fires. Using kids and representing them as the source of crime demeaned our reputation. I never expected that Dhaka will be presented so badly in our first collaboration with a Hollywood movie using kids. Are we so down to earth that we have to use kids for that? Okay, the director wanted to make it more realistic but I felt that he wanted to bring the ISIS vibe where we saw pictures of kids with guns.3. Why the Hell the Drug Lord of Dhaka cannot speak proper Bangla? They could have used our artists for that. I guess The Drug Lord of Dhaka was from India. It was depressing.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

The cast is solid, and the choice of characters is interesting. Chris Hemsworth is excellent as Tyler Rake.The action scenes are tense, superbly choreographed and the direction is excellent. Chris Hemsworth is definitely the right choice for this role.We also have some background stories about the main character, Tyler Rake, and so we reveal some details from his life and what makes him who he is. This is skillfully incorporated into the story without the film losing anything of the suspense and quick sequence of events.Most movies today are thrash, especially those made for streaming services, but this one is surprisingly entertaining, with great action scenes and a good cast. Excellent directing, tense and brutal action scenes, solid cast and constant action.A simple, brutal, adrenaline-fueled ride with great action scenes.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Pay no attention to the negative Indian, Bengali (wherever) and Bangladeshi comments. You can't do anything right with them anyway. They always give their own movies 10 points for that. I always give points for new interesting original locations. Great actors. A bit underwhelming. I give them an extra point for the penultimate final scene. It was worthy of James Bond. Minus point for starting with a scene from the end. Netflix has had that since Breaking Bad. I always find it annoying. That's when you don't want to shoot a firecracker entry. But I still like to keep going.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Extraction is an outlier that has added one more feather into the action genre. Gripping story from the start, it kept me hooked on the screen with the tight direction and realistic action. Initially, from the reviews I assumed that the yellow filter is not done correctly, but not only it is a non-issue (I was watching it with a bit of a sensitivity towards it and it never affected my experience) but it was much needed to present a country of action from the rest of the world.

Currently, productions are very restricted when looking for some quality or some component that attracts all the attention and transforms the film, in fact, good; there are examples, of course, but with the number produced, the result should be better. This conspired for a feeling of emptiness in the hearts of fans of this iconic genre and when we come across a good production, the heart beats with happiness, that's the truth! Who hasn't been thrilled with John Wick? Action films can be very chic, just that the cinema made use all the good in your favor.The Rescue is an adaptation of HQ Ciudad, written by Ande Parks and the Russo brothers and is a project with long dates. Before it was released, the intention to take it to the cinema already existed, but many things have changed since then. The story narrates a mission by a black market mercenary whose objective is to rescue the daughter of a South American drug dealer, this in HQ; when starting the project, in 2012, the protagonist would be the star The Rock and the direction and cast was completely different, but everything changed, who took the lead was Chris Hemsworth, another thing was also the setting, exchanging south america for india and Thailand. The new chairman was Sam Hargrave, who has a long career as a stuntman in Hollywood and has acted as a stuntman and stunt coordinator in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, these names generated great expectations and the result could not have been anything else, one great action movie.When cinema is made with passion and by those who understand it, it is another level, not that others do not know, but being specific here, I refer to what the film proposes, action. the script is simple and common, the protagonist who is almost an army, traumatized and usually drinking, leaving for a mission that may be the last; there are many films with this premise and it is normal to some extent, what will differentiate is how it will be presented and developed, how the aspects will be addressed, the relationship between the rescuer and the rescued is an example of this, and how the setting will be built. I can say that the choice of a director (even if he is new to the chair) experienced in what is really action in the lens, was the biggest hit of this film, without a doubt. The realism presented is impressive from the first minutes, it does not take long for the director to put the camera in his hand and go out with everything, his experience helps to put himself in the right point of the take, in the exact rotation. By opting for less stuntmen on the scene, the audience's approach was also greater, the protagonist is present in many scenes that usually the face would be hidden, the style of filming also deserves to be highlighted. Hargrave uses several techniques to embody his film, the camera in hand already mentioned is used at various times to bring this realism, for sure the director lay down, knelt down and got up running to follow everything he wanted to capture, the dense scenery of an Indian city with those tight streets, full of people, cars, boxes, animals and everything that can be placed there, contributed a lot to the frantic and agonizing rhythm. There is an excellent sequence plan, another sequence that looks like a video game cutscene; the camera takes the action from the front, turns to the side, climbs, turns, swings, a door opens, shows the action of the character (engaging a gear), turns the look again, turns forward and continues, it is sensational.The action scenes with hand-to-hand combat are of a high level too, everything is organic and no matter how much you look for a defect it is difficult to find, again, the camera works well in the movements and everything happens, fight with a knife, shots with different weapons , neutralization sequences that make everything more plastic, shot in the foot, in the body, in the head, rotate the gun for better positioning of the body, change the type of weapon, return to the knife, go to the hand ... phew !!! It's really frantic. I couldn't imagine this film in America, the locations contribute a lot to the geography and the profile, the feeling of crowding at all times causes a claustrophobic effect and the yellowish filter causes a mixture that warms everything, that place looks like a hell of hot. At various times I found myself making comparisons with John Wick, for the plasticity, ignorance and at the same time, the subtlety in worrying about the details to make everything perfect in the eyes of the viewer.
The cast is very lean and obviously pulled by its biggest star, Hemsworth is an actor who has shown himself to be quite versatile, including in comedies. Here he is very well and has his role outside the MCU, I am not surprised if he stops being Thor, for some, and becoming the ""rescue guy"", the commitment to production brought an excellent result. David Harbor is another name known to the general public, but his character is very shy in production and has no prominence. On the other hand, Randeep Hooda, who plays the kidnapper's coast guard, deserves more attention. Hooda is very well known in the Hindu scene and brought a commitment equal to that of the protagonist, most of the best scenes involve his character and, as I said, the result is very good. The rest of the cast follows a well-defined acting pattern that does not compromise on anything, there is no one to say ""this actor is too bad"", despite having a very caricature tone in some. I understand that it was due to the Indian style, many actors work in Hindu cinema and have their own characteristics, the lack of custom in watching Bollywood films creates a certain visual barrier, I recommend even paying attention to this industry, which like any other, it has its mistakes and successes.The Rescue is a film that arrives to fill a gap and finally marks a hit by Netflix in blockbuster-like productions, pushing the mind, for example, Squadron 6. It is a great choice for today and is very worthwhile increase, especially if you are part of the generation that had a lot of fun with the eighteenth-century troglodytes. It draws attention for the already praised work of the director who, like Chad Stahelski, goes on the radar. At the end of the film, I only had a smile because the air was gone.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie is directed by Sam Hargrave, and stars Chris Hemswort (Tyler Rake), Bryon Lerum(Rake's son), Ryder Lerum(Rake's son ) , Randeep Hooda (Saju), Rudraksh Jaiswal (Omi Mahajan) and others.
This new Netflix original action movie is based on a graphic novel co authored by the Russo brothers.
The movie Extraction sees Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth)as a black market mercenary , who is enlisted to rescue the kidnapped son (Rudhraksh Jaiswal)of an imprisoned international crime lord.
The movie has impressive camera work and action sequence.
It's surely a gun fight action movie with some great hand to hand combat scenes.
Although to bring in some criticism , the movie lacked some logic and purpose of reality , with a poor story line.
But if one is looking for entertainment , you shouldn't miss watching it.
The movie somewhere lies in between good and bad.
The movies definitely has some of the best pure action choreogtaphy and cinematography .
Extraction seems fortunately timed for its streaming rollout which could atleast momentarily satisfy people deprived of the big screen.
For the attractive cast and sleek cinematography the movie can be definitely watched for entertainment and action lovers.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Those fed up of quick cuts in recent action movies would be pleasantly surprised to find long takes in this film (in this case, a prolonged single-shot action sequence!) instead of fast cutting. The color tone is rich and suits the film's own tone. There are a couple of dramatic breaks between the action that make the viewers root for the characters.Chris Hemsworth delivers an impressive performance that gels with his character, while Rudraksh Jaiswal also presents us with a neat act. It's finally very satisfying to see Randeep Hooda doing a character like this. Make no mistake, he's done a couple of action films before but never did he play a tough character like this: one that allows him to both throw a punch and emote whenever needed.Extraction is also surprisingly realistic in terms of how it doesn't want to turn heroes into indestructible characters. When they get hit, they bleed. When they are injured, they feel pain. And given how all of this is done masterfully during its video-game style action, Extraction fulfills the action genre to its fullest. Again, since there's no way one's gonna step out and pay to buy tickets and popcorn to a movie at this moment, it's better to stay home, grab some snacks and prepare yourself for a thrill-a-minute, no-nonsense action ride called Extraction. Action aficionados are definitely in for a massive treat.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

These are great action movies. Extraction is just an average one because three main reasons.First, acting is pretty poor. I do not expect an Oscar winner as a lead actor, but Keanu, Benicio and even Sly, are more credible than Chris. I like Chris but not here. I didn't feel any empathy for him.Second, the script is pretty weak and the ending a joke. Again, I do not expect too much, but there are a bunch of extremely unbelievable situations and decisions by the characters that makes this movie sometimes awkward.Last, the use of CGI here is not bad but some explosions looked cheap and the scene jumping from the waterfall and then doing underwater meditation was embarrasing.
There are many examples of good action movies with a low budget but pretty real, raw and brutal. Check action scenes on Rambo 4 to see what I am talking about.
So, overall an average action film to watch during the lockdown. Forgettable after it.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Hemsworth is brilliant, he gets the tone just right. Surprise package was Randeep Hooda, he was excellent. The action scenes are tightly shot, the camera work is really good. For me setting this movie in Bangladesh is a side show, this movie could have been filmed anywhere, and to all those who are upset that the movie makes Bangladesh look bad, I disagree, the movie is based on gangsters, they kept the kidnapped child in the slums and the rest of the movie is based on trying to get out of that area. Those who are saying gangsters don't behave in that manner in Bangladesh, well that's pure BS, homeless kids throughout the sub continent are taken advantage of by evil people, and we all know how the authorities can be bought, don't duck the truth face it.Finally, two negatives, I guess the movie could have been 15 mins shorter, the actor who play the kidnapped kid could have been replaced with someone better.Watch this movie, and ignore the scores given by the pro Bangladesh activists,","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's peace loving and heartful to the foreigners. There maybe some sorts of violence by bad political incidences. But it's not more EXTRACTIVE like Afghanistan or Somalia. Rather in India the condition is more EXTRACTIVE.
I think the movie 'Extraction' was produced just to conquer the market of India by Netflix. There was no story, boring action. The only question I want to ask to the producers that, 'Did they ever visited Dhaka'. I think they had better visit Dhaka and make the film. The 'Bangla' we listened in the film was not Bangla at all.
Guys, this is totally a disaster I think. Better to watch BLOODY INDIAN Bollywood films.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Here we are and this is that movie. First off, Hemsworth is finding his niche and excelling in it. He has his body and his acting lined up and the audience likes both. The director took that and his skills and gave us a adrenaline rush of a movie so action-packed that not only makes the point of not giving up but things aren't over until they are. Good story, twists, special forces, weapons galore and the scenery or locations are impressive for their realism. Might I also point out that we get some good closure at the end which viewers must have if movies like this will thrive. Highly recommend a tasty snack or two (to ward off biting nails) and a tasty drink","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Perhaps expectations superseded understanding of an excellent production. Especially when reviews are cloudy, wishy washy and just thrown out there for the sake of writing one.To be fair, the moment I saw the names Chis Hemsworth and Joe & Anthony Russo one could only imagine the child in me after watching Endgame.
I thought, even for a fiction flick of this nature, there was depth, intelligence and outstanding performances from Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda. The action sequences were incredible, for lack of a better word and the story line is quite believable considering the real world.For me, watching a great movie means that I have to be drawn to it from beginning to end. I went into the film with a lot of expectation considering the likes of 13 Hours and Lone Survivor. Because of the outcome of it, the depth in the performances of Chris and Randeep, and the music score that adds to the intensity, I would watch it again. Not too soon, but I would. Netflix did it!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Hemsworth must protect the boy from many enemies as he tears through the Bangladesh concrete jungle with kinetic force.As indicated, the story is propped up by its action.

Great cast with awesome performances from chris Hemsworth and the kid. The villains are also done well where you do sincerely dislike them. This isnt a drama so Rambo acting is good enough for me.Cinematography/fight scenes: 11/10
Absolutely the highlight of this film is the fight scenes and action scenes. The technical application is 10/10. The director of this is a stunt co coordinator for many famous films and he shows his skill here. Every shot, punch, death is immersive and feels powerful and real. They have long scenes that are blended and cut so insanely well. This is up there and imo better than ""hitmans bodyguard"" and ""kingsman"" when it comes to action scenes. I promise you many, many many stunt men were hurt in the making of this.Story: 6.5/10
As everyone states yes it doesnt have the best of story. Is it bad? Hell no. It's just typical. It's interesting throughout, you care for the main characters. The end is a nice send off and is symbolic/foreshadowed well. It's just nothing new but that's okay.Summary:
This is top 3 best ever action stunt movies out there. The story isnt anything new, but it's good.

But what a terrible accent of Bangla. I was Shocked after hearing Bangla from movie characters. I couldn't decide what to laugh or not😐 And another thing every house they enter, hindi songs were playing. This is not acceptable. And leave alone the atmosphere of Dhaka. I've never seen such a yellow city in my life🙂.Children are carrying guns🤣 You've made this a terrorist city. Seriously??
Was expecting better than that.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was therefore very pleasantly surprised to see just how well crafted this movie is. It has excellent grounded action scenes, great set pieces, fantastic cinematography (I'm a sucker for those epic long takes) and a surprising amount of emotion in large part thanks to amazing performances by Chris Hemsworth and the kid who plays Ovi.True, the story isn't too much to write home about, but it gets the job done setting up the action that is the bulk of the movie. And of course it's an action movie in which one guy manages to take out entire armies so be prepared to suspend your disbelief a bit, but thanks to the excellent execution it never took me out of It. The movie catches its breath a few times and doesn't feel dull in those moments, thanks to the interactions between Hemsworth and the kid. Didn't know this movie was partially produced by the Russo brothers, but it made total sense after seeing it.If you like well executed action movies that don't just rely on CGI explosions and fast editing, give this a watch. You probably won't regret it. At least I didn't.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I suggest you watch that movie alone and with as much silence as is possible. And grab a pillow to punch sometimes. I rate it an 8/10. The ending had me with mixed feelings; something like sadness with a spice of hope.

It was all about developing a profitable product for a broader consumer market. Casting two established Bollywood actors (at lower wage), paying for hindi music bits, faking Kolkata locations and ambience as Dhaka and casting Thor himself was to bag in the greater usual netflix crowd from India. Putting the name Dhaka and just showing freelance drone-shots of the city and shamelessly fooling around with inappropriate accent, language, culture and ambience along with lack of any Bangladeshi actor still brings in Bangladeshi viewers. Engaging a reputed line producer from Bangladesh and well portraying the country was not a big deal but I guess Netflix cautiously ignored it.Hence, Netflix will certainly recover the investment with full profit. But for the creative hats looking into the mirror, it's hard not to regret for such pricy and smelly trash.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

The 11+ minute one-shot is fantastic and doesn't just come across as a neat trick, but actually helps pull you into the action and feel the exhaustion of the characters as they weave their way through the bad guys. Masterfully done.The bad: The predictable plot is just a vehicle for the action, and the characters (both pro/antagonists) are mostly cliches.Should I watch it? If you like action then yes. Definitely. The action and fight choerography is top-notch and Chris Hemsworth is rock-solid as the lead.

"9","/10","A Highly Rewatchable Entertaining Action Flick","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5676915/?ref_=tt_urv","totalovrdose","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur52795042/?ref_=tt_urv","25 April 2020","Extraction is a brainless action film, which not only understands its identity, but under the competent helm of Sam Hargrave, is executed beautifully. Many action films feel the need to insert shaky hand-held camera (I'm looking at you Michael Mann), or worse still, frenetic cuts that are challenging to follow, but it's the use of steady-cam, and the smooth pacing, that really makes the film easy to watch.With plenty of shoot-outs, some fine looking explosions (though one is a little hit and miss), plenty of guys being thrown left and right by the protagonist, and the inclusion of the best knife fight I have seen since Jeong-Beom Lee's The Man From Nowhere, this film has virtually everything 'cept the kitchen sink. I had heard the film's violence was viscerally exaggerated, though I would disagree. It's no Freddy Vs. Jason, but it's no Jason Bourne either, so expect to see your fair share, but you won't ever need a towel to wipe it from your screen.A good action film needs an equally great villain accompanying it. Extraction, in this department, is rather lacking. Priyanshu Painfulli portrays drug-lord Amir, whose innumerable henchmen and child soldiers are enforced by Shataf Figar as the Colonel, who can authoritatively shut down the city of Bangladesh in a heartbeat when crap hits the fan. These characters are similar to The Voice in Man on Fire; rarely ever seen, yet their influence is around every corner. To exacerbate their ruthlessness, more screen-time was needed.The use of metaphor is well inserted on occasion, through dialogue and accompanying visuals, and it is this that perhaps gives the most depth to Chris Hemsworth's Tyler, other than the moments when he simply tells us his backstory to strangers, akin to Cruise and Foxx in Collateral (without the antagonism). He portrays a larrikin mercenary, his genuine Australian accent accentuating his tough guy image (because who doesn't like a good occa?), his boyish charms and poignant backstory making him incredibly likable. Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal), the teenager he is assigned to 'extract' from Amir, who has had him kidnapped for not only a large sum, but to show his imprisoned father who's boss, is also equally enjoyable to watch, and though he receives the same lacking amount of characterization, his humanity is an engraved part of the film.Randeep Hooda joins the cast as Saju, a bodyguard whose intentions are initially difficult to fathom, though his limited characterization reveals a family-man buried beneath his grizzled exterior. David Harbour's Gaspar, who is in the film for probably all of eight minutes, portrays a character who believes the end justifies the means, while Golshifteh Farahani as Nik, is easily the only character capable of stealing the light from Hemsworth. A brilliant tactician, who can control any situation, and can wield all manner of conventional firearms - she is the ultimate waifu.At the end of the day, the story is pretty bare-bones; boy gets kidnapped and must be rescued, with predictable double-crosses abound, though that doesn't make it any less entertaining, or recommendable - at the same time though, it is forgettable, requiring little in the way of brain power. For a film that occasionally breaks the 'show don't tell' rule of cinema, the end is very much multi-interpretative, adding depth to an otherwise two-dimensional feature. I personally think Hemsworth should be in more movies like this; gritty fun action films that remind us of decades earlier, when movies were more concerned with entertainment, instead of politics, whilst Hargrave has equally shown us that stuntmen, much like Chad Stahelski and David Lietch, make for some of the best action directors in the business today.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The problem with making a film like this one so gritty and realistic and violent and dark, is that the plot and script must also represent this. This script and story dont even try.The entire premise makes no sense...they insist on saving one kid for an evil drug lord...but dont mind killing 100 or 200 other people with children of their own who are just following orders and are probably just decent policemen who have no idea what's going on.And they wont even get paid for it.And theyll all probably die.And, somehow, in the opener, one guy double crossed them and knew exactly where all his team was, even the guy in the woods. Such a bad lazy script all around meant only, one mist assume, to practice new stunts and choreography.Beyond that, it is obvious that you will know all the cliches and tropes. But. You wont see some of the car hits coming because they are well shot, but also completely nonsensical since they come one after another, yet no one sees are hears them coming...again and again. Are the streets in india or Bangladesh covered in silent and cloaked electric vehicles? How about a gun and knife battle with cars and people that see it and completely ignore it and just try to get in the way of it. I mean, it is action and looks cool, if not real all the time, but it makes you groan often.The acting is actually good all around, even the kid.Oh, and of course, a beautiful woman gets the last kill without warning or explaining any of it, including what exactly physically makes her equipped to be such a character or how she possibly gets near the villain.Frustrating. So much talent involved and it's just another one of these movies...","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Action sequence is a match for john wick
Wide angle shots mostly in action sequences
Not much in character development but the movie takes time to let us know about the characters, its just that their characters dont develop but characters are still interesting to know about and still the movie is really great and keeps u on the edge of ur seat, specially the long sequences the movie is shot in is a beauty to watch.

There's your narrative, it's a basic set up and it knows it, and they sure as hell waste no time in getting down to the nitty gritty stuff.Sam Hargrave comes from a background of working on stunts for some pretty high profile films and he certainly utilises that here in his directorial debut. Hargrave goes for the serious approach to his film so there isn't much time to stop for any comedy, which suits the film's fast-paced and brutal action sequences down to a tee. One in particular, a long take action sequence that moves from vehicles to an apartment block before falling down to the streets, is up there as one of the most impressive action sequences I've seen in a film, the swift camera movements and stunt choreography really something to behold.Hemsworth leads the film well with a dominating screen presence, whether it be scoring headshot after headshot on an armed unit or slapping a bunch of adolescent soldiers about. The physicality of the performance is demanding and it's impressively handled by everyone involved.The film does drag a little in places and it feels as if 15-20 minutes could be shaved off but I'd be lying if I said that I wasn't engrossed by what was happening throughout. Extraction has the added bonus of the lead character with the surname Rake actually killing someone with a rake. Bravo.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I mean, who taps Play on an Action film about a fearless mercenary and them complains about too much violence or lack of plot? I really like action films and this is one is flawless in the acting and direction. It also may be one of the most violent I've seen recently. But I was very impressed with the fight scenes! And turns out the Director is a stunt man himself. So there you go! The fight scenes and action were so good that the camera actually holds the shot instead of leaving it to the viewer's imagination. I was impressed at the level of acting and stamina it must take to follow through on these scenes. And with most of the cast being unknowns, we have to be impressed by the direction. You literally can't look away or you'll miss something. The plot was actually believable on the most basic level though not novel. And yes, at some point one wonders if it makes enough sense. There's a lot of innuendo instead of all the hand holding that Hollywood inserts, which I appreciated - giving the audience some credit for intelligence. All the cast did a great job but big props to Chris for working hard here and I hope Sam continues to direct action films.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

'Extraction' and 'John Wick' are quite different kinds of movies, but they are both upper echelon action. Hemsworth is an absolute beast and electric throughout.As stated with other reviews the plot is simple, which I have absolutely no issue with. Too often nowadays films are muddled with confusing or unrealistic plot twists. Something like this it's best to keep it to the point with the focus on fantastic action sequences.Speaking of action sequences, how about that continuous scene of 11 minutes and change? This is of course accomplished with several takes and gives the illusion of an uninterrupted thrill ride, but impressive nonetheless. That long of an exciting scene reminded me of the one at the beginning of 'The Revenant'It was nice to see Hollywood and Bollywood come to together and make this. It's not often we see movies like this take place in this part of the world.With the limited amount of movies we got in 2020, 'Extraction' is likely my favourite action movie of the year. A non stop adrenaline rush that delivers high quality fight choreography, stunts, and competent gun fighting. This is no doubt due to director, Sam Hargrave's extensive knowledge and experience in those areas. Well worth the watch.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Exploding, inventive and clear action scenes, awesome 11+ minute ""single shot"" -section and great use of exotic locations, colourful environment and sound effects.Chris Hemsworth fights his way through with effortless charisma and believability. All the other characters, from evil drug lords to lowly gang members are well written, and given some human background. Even if there are some stereotypes too.If the movie was cut 15-20 minutes shorter, it would have been even better - the brutal action gets a little repetitive towards the end. Bodycount is high.But overall, great action film and I recommend watching and following Sam Hargrave to discuss making of the action scenes - his enthusiasm, dedication and professional background shines bright trough!

The violence is quite excessive though.I understand people feel offended how Dhaka is portrayed and that it isn't realistic. But honestly, it's a movie. It's almost never accurate. How many times don't you see Hawaii, while the movie is supposedly set in South America for example. Or you're supposedly watching a scene in Amsterdam, while it's a square in a different country. And wooden clogs are added to make it authentic, because people apparently believe that's what Dutch people still use these days. It's stupid, but point is, it is the movies.

Other movies should take note and replicate how the action was done in this movie. The camera wasn't all over the place like a lot of these types of movies try to do, which made me able to take it all in. It was also realistic with a nice minimal touch of over the topness. The plot was simple but solid, and rarely took me out of the movie. The acting was good as well, and the characters were cast correctly. Hemsworth plays this role well. It wasn't perfect, as there were a couple times where you are asked to sort of ""just go with it"", but overall really good. Very pleasantly surprised.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

You saw the previews and knew what you were getting, so the logic of people complaining that this wasn't ""Citizen Kane"" is lost on me. For those who don't know, this was a film adaptation of a ""graphic novel"" (comic book, for those over 30) and that genre is not well-known for its engaging storytelling.Let me say up front -- the cinematography, fight choreography and seamless special effects (camera behind the car, pulling up alongside, outside the car, panning back and forth, then suddenly *inside* the car, exiting the other side in a long, unbroken chase scene... take a bow FX guys!) combine with a story that's unexpectedly complex for its simplistic origins.All the actors turned in amazing performances, even though all but the two leads didn't have a great deal to work with. Randeep Hooda was particularly memorable as his character wasn't the cookie-cutter character as his motivations are revealed.In short, if you have a couple hours to spare and need a bit of high-octane escapism that doesn't require you to turn your brain off, you may enjoy this. I certainly did!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It turns out a rival drug lord has taken the kid to a neighboring country so Hemsworth, an Aussie military man, all biceps & emotional chips on his shoulders, & his team, including his liaison played by Golshifteh Farahani, warns him about the tenuous nature of the job but Hemsworth pushes forward regardless & although the initial snatching up of the boy goes easily (for a seasoned professional!), backstabs & betrayals occur when Hemsworth's team start getting knocked off by the boy's father's handler (he's been warned by the father to get the son back or forfeit his own family) while the kidnapper sends crooked cops en masse in hot pursuit to stop Hemsworth & the boy from crossing a particular bridge to freedom (& where the same guy who betrayed them suddenly joins the cause) w/every shot bullet felt & every blinding explosion forcing one to turn away, this is a thrill a minute actioner w/some inventive camerawork (an extended knife fight between Hemsworth & the nominal baddie is a treat for action hounds). David Harbour shows up as an old friend of Hemsworth's to lend a hand when things get particularly tough.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Very impressed by Chris Hemsworth's action sequences. It's Jason Borne meets John Wick, Call of Duty style. Would love to see CH in the next Mission Impossible movie.The 12min-long single camera shot was sick. All the supporting roles were great. The most entertaining movie Netflix has put out so far during this PC & girl-power pandemic. Maybe they're beginning to choose entertainment over wokeness. One can only hope.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I am thoroughly impressed with all that went into this and the outcome is worth a 'standing o' . I hope they make use of this and make a sequel. What a really good movie. Even the long running shows I like do not come close to the planning, artistry and considerations that went into this.

We have watched similar to it many times!

Certainly not the best in the genre but then it sure is one time watch.In these elongated single shot sequence movies or in action movies in general, the story always goes for toss, I still don't understand the point of fast and furious but they are enjoyable. Exceptions would be Bourne series which has a lot more gripping tale to tell although action is the main focus. This movie story assessment falls in between. The plot is not the high point.The high point are the action sequences. There is a floating sense of bourne series, a touch of 'the raid' specially the fights within buildings. some of the gun shooting are slick.Chris Hemsworth in my opinion overshadows others mostly by his strong physical appearance, Other mention would be Randeep Hooda, he had his presence marked, all others did what they are supposed to do, no stellar performances.Now few words about misrepresentation of Dhaka, I feel movie as a form in itself is a misrepresentation, If you want a true representation look for a Documentary. Slumdog millionaire won Oscar though people were pissed off because it misrepresented Mumbai (Bombay). Here is the thing, When you are making a commercial movie, You look for bare minimum and you stroke the preconceived notions of people. They highlight the things which fascinates people, I personally didn't like the overuse of chromatic lighting to make street looks dirtier. But then I feel you are not doing yourself a favor by being offended.All in all it's a one time watch with good action sequences and it's always pleasing to watch Chris Hemsworth who also produced the movie.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

That's Extraction for you. The story is a wrap around the central theme - more action. Since this has already made you curious, Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), a mercenary working on death defying assignments, is given the responsibility of extracting Ovi Mahajan Jr. (Rudraksh Jaiswal), the son of an international crime lord Ovi Mahajan Sr. (Pankaj Tripathi, in a blink and you miss role) from the den of another crime lord Amir Asif (Priyanshu Paiyuli), based in Dhaka. Also in the fray to rescue Ovi is Saju (Randeep Hooda) who works for Ovi Sr., under the threat that the failure will lead to the elimination of Saju's family.It's a formulaic pot boiler really. The only difference is that there's very little spoken stuff, exchanges are mostly in the form of armed combats, car chases and raining bullets. In its cheapest form, the hand to hand combats are with a myriad of knives, or anything else that is found handy. The high point in the film for me was when Hemsworth speaks in Bangla asking for evidence, ""Promaan Dao"" (show me the evidence, for those who didn't know), not once but thrice stunning the original captors and the dumb struck audience - I am almost certain that the looks on our faces would have mirrored those he was addressing on screen. Well, after a couple of hours of mayhem Ovi is indeed rescued but not before almost everyone dies. The film gets full marks for the fight fest and zero for anyone's acting - actually no one needed to act. Shataf Figar makes his presence felt inadequate small role of a sniper in Dhaka.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

There's also some smart levity in it but it is an action movie.The action looks like it hurt, it's violent AF, intense and vicious. They let it breath, literally, making it feels real and very much like you're in it with them. As a result there is not much suspension of disbelief needed. The fight scenes, close quarters fighting chases and gun battle have a danger feel to them and a high cost throughout the film. I have a favorite fight scene though, all I'll say is kids.The directing is very smart with the tracking, using the idea of camera posing to hide the stuntman but using it in tracking shots, making us watch one way at some interesting thing while you know what's happening off camera, then picking back up to where we were it's amazing. Sam Hargrave delivers big time, he's one to watch.The acting is amazing, top notch, it pluses the story and help carry the emotional weight. The cast is region accurate and the actors are great. Hemsworth did not hog the screen time - take note Robbie - and was surrounded by talented actors.By the way I totally spotted a Thor reference, did you ?Extraction, sponsored by Tupperware - don't think I missed the Tupperware bottle Hemsworth gave the kid - is a really good movie.

Well, I don't give a rat's eye about that, neither do I bother about any emotional core or a crackerjack of a story, because hey, anyone who has seen the trailer SHOULD KNOW that this movie ain't about any of that. At no point in time have those associated in the making of this movie given the impression that this will be anything more than an out-and-out action movie, and I assure you that it surely delivers on that front.
The action choreography is brilliant! Raw, visceral, brutal and realistically shot with real world stakes. The centrepiece action sequence, a one-take shot that moves from a car chase to a building shootout to a knife fight to finally a truck chase, is a marvel! Chris Hemsworth excels and so does Randeep Hooda and Rudraksh Jaiswal.
BOTTOMLINE : If you're a fan of action movies in the same vein as of John Wick, Raid or Atomic Blonde, do give this movie a chance. I'm sure you won't be disappointed.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie receives a 0 from me in other areas. If you watch enough movies the plot becomes so obvious within 15 minutes into the movie. There's nothing new to the storyline, the same 'military man- haunted past-lost family' stuff recycled in Hollywood over and over again. It'll certainly be entertaining for casual audience especially the younger generation. But there's nothing in the movie apart from the visuals. I'd even say the plot is worse than expected. Motivation for the kidnapping doesn't make any kind of sense at all. Money? Come on, seriously?

The production values are impressive, the action is directed stellar for most of the time and Chris Hemsworth is a great action hero.The plot itself isn't amazing, but it serves enough reason for all the shooting, kicking and screaming. I'm surprised some people are annoyed by this, as this didn't seem to be a problem with Max Max Fury Road or John Wick - Great movies in their own right. Instead it focuses on what it also does best: The juicy action! Hemsworth is hands-on, he sure took quite some beating while making. His character is written well enough to feel believeable and his acting is on par. Same goes for Randeep Hooda, who is quite explosive as the antagonist.Most of the creativity and talent by the crew was spent in the first half and it shows. The camera work and the direction is simply amazing, the car chase scene left me puzzeling what was going on (in a good way). Sadly the creativity drops off quite going towards the ending, which is a little disappointing. It all becomes a little too predictable and cheesy.Nevertheless a highly recommendable no-bullshit action flick.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is an action film. It appears that some were sorely disappointed that it was not a rom-com, a period drama or an ""important film"". However, as an action movie, it is far better than average. In terms of intensity, originality, and production value, this is often on par with John Wick. True the plot is not particularly intricate and the character development is minimal, but much is done with little. There is no sense that any of the actors are phoning in the performance because on paper they aren't given much of an opportunity to show other dimensions. The movie covers events over a short period of time and the characters are focused on the issues at hand. There are a few breathers but we aren't sidetracked into forced ""lets talk about us"" scenes in the middle of life or death struggle. With the superhero genre beaten to death, a straight-forward fast-paced entertaining film is an increasingly rare gem and well worth the watch.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In the end, this movie is as realistic as any superhero movie (and less than many of them, even).Having said that, the action is superb. While the characters aren't more than avatars and the story as thin as possible (rescuing X, in the hands of X in the City X), the chase sequences and shootouts are insane. Some are ""one take"" long shots. Not in the ridiculously boring 1917 way, with minutes and minutes of nothing BUT IN ONE SHOT. And not in the unnecessary Birdman way, that brought nothing to the story, but more in the ""Children of Men"" way (even if that movie is way better).For the action? 10 pts. For all the rest? 0 pts.

The action sequences are honestly incredible, the plot is weak and if the Russo brothers didn't have their names attached, it wouldn't of been such a high budget. Character development is poor as I didn't feel too attached to any of them but that's fine, the film knows it's a gritty action packed film and keeps to that, the character development as I said is poor but is there to help you try and rout for them to survive. Most Netflix films are trash and I turn them off after the first 20 minutes but I really didn't want to turn this one off. You can easily tell that the director was a former stuntman as the action sequences are so good, for me, they are up there with some of the John Wick fights, Chris Hemsworth does well with the role and it's good to see him play a role with a lot more grit and an almost darker side than I've seen in a while especially compared to the MCU.If the action sequences weren't as good then this would get a 5, they make that much of a difference!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Now the pros the action and wow oh wow I want to see chris do films more like this. It was shot wonderfully I couldn't keep my eyes of the screen it was like watching a amped up Jason bourne. Used everything at his disposal and its shot in a similar 1917 style one shot during certain action scenes which really set the bar and the gore left me watching the screen cringing as made me feel there pain.This film would of been a 10 if the story was better but for an easy Friday night action film it's a treat.

Yes, the plot is simple, but I don't necessarily see that taking away anything from the movie. With the intensity of 'Rambo', but the stylish precision of 'John Wick', this film is a perfect example of what an action movie should look like in 2020. The action sequences are simply breathtaking; each and every action sequence is wonderfully crafted and some camera angles during the fights are surprisingly awesome. There are incredible hand-to-hand combats, exciting chases and other fantasically choreographed stunts that makes this film the most exciting, and joyously violent, film of 2020. There's even some good dark humour in there too. Chris Hemsworth gives one of the best performance of his career. Not only is he incredibly physical in the role, but I actually believed the emotional side of his character; which with Hemsworth isn't usually the case. The supporting cast is also great; as is the cinematography; sound design and the excellent hair and makeup department. All in all, Extraction is a fun, action-filled film with little story but it doesn't matter.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's about the rescue of a kidnapped boy in Bangladesh and a team of Australian mercenaries is supposed to fix it.+ The best action scenes since Terminator 2.+ Excellent first feature from a director who previously worked as a stuntman
+ Chris Hemsworth fits perfectly as the lead
+ Few cuts, down to earth fights
+ The main and supporting actors often have to work as a team, Rambo style alone is not always enough
+ Everyone, including and especially Hemsworth, is shown as vulnerable
+ Despite plot armor, Hemsworth's character keeps making mistakes he has to correct....
+ ... and also shows emotions again and again
+ The story has exciting turning points....
Conclusion: A mix of Rambo, Terminator 2 and Tears of the Sun, but still original and very well done by all rules of action art. A few cliché weaknesses and a not quite well thought-out plot are missing for the best rating.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I guess my only critic on this is the plot perhaps a different twist about who the boy was would have made it more interesting but nevertheless an awesome action film overall.

The action sequences are up there with the very best, the plot based on Ciudad has some palpable tense moments and Chris Hemsworth has done justice to the mercenary with a baggage role.Don't get influenced by the Bangladeshi people who have a problem with the accents or the shabby state shown of Dhaka. Trust me, I've been there, it's much worse. Also the accent is definitely not West Bengal, it's Bangladeshi for sure. It's just easy to raise questions on authenticity when you feel disappointed about the portrayal of your country, but kindly do not let it come in the way while enjoying a movie.The film juggles with the concept of internal conflicts, mercy killing, guilt nd walking the right path even if the odds are stacked against you, and does a good job of it.

1. This country is a country of drug lords where the police, elite force (RAB) and even our proud army all work under one drug lord.
2. There is a lack of men in this country, so young children become soldiers of the drug lord with AK-47s in their hands, as happens in Myanmar, Somalia and other countries.
3. There is no air defense or air force in this country, a few Firingi forces flee in civilian helicopters after washing the country's army, police, RAB, but no one intercepts it.
4. Bangladesh is an extremist, corrupt, drug empire state.

THIS IS DEDICATED TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN DEFENDING EXTRACTION.Okay I have many points but would like to talk about two main points.
1. THE BANGLADESHI RAP SONG - Please check the subtitles carefully. It has been clearly mentioned as a hindi rap song. I question the production team how they allowed to sell a song like this.2. THE BANGLADESHI ARMY - Who gave them the right to belittle Bangladesh army dress. Lot of you might say that it is not the exact dress, dude they have used the 🇧🇩 flag on the shoulders.
I AM A CIVILIAN still I would be against this because the army is not a force to be neglected this way.THERE ARE MANY MORE LIKE A WHOLE MOVIE WITH KOLKATA BANGLA LANGUAGE AND WITH NO BANGLADESHI ACTORS . Donot say they donot have the budget to hire bengali actor and I can assure that there is better actors like Chanchal and many more.
REPRESENTATION MIGHT BE OVERSEEN AS THIS IS MOVIE BUT THIS POINTS CANNOT BE OVERSEEN.
THANKYOU FOR READING AND PLEASE RATE THE MOVIE BADLY. HAVE A GREAT RAMADAN.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

You feel every gun shot has an impact and every knife wound actually does something to the person.The plot is simple. Get the kid extract him to safety from the bad guys nothing else to fluff the scenario with useless stuff.Really good old school action movie really. Straight to the point action flick.Usually these kind of movies are made cheap straight to DVD with bad actors and low budget and they hire a too old Bruce Willis to sell tickets and just end up bad but not this one they really wanted to do something good.

At two hours in length the film is ninety minutes of fighting and thirty minutes of explanatory dialogue. To judge this film fairly it should be held up alongside other films in the over-the-top thriller genre; The John Wicks and the Jason Bournes. And, in fact, it holds up very well.Here's the story. Tyler Rakes will be paid a lot of money to free a boy from the clutches of an evil Bangladeshi drug lord. The boy's father is in jail; he's an evil drug lord himself. So we've got battling drug lords. Add to the mix the boy's former personal protector, and then throw in a military officer who is on the take from the Bangladeshi drug lord, and you've got a lot of people attempting to get their hands on that kid.The combat scenes are flat out great. Many of them involve a camera in close pursuit of the antagonists so that we feel that we are racing up those steps, or leaping from roof-top to roof-top along with the combatants. If this sort of camera work has been so well done before - or done at all - I cannot remember it. The fights appear to be 'the real thing' and not a choreographed piece of action. On the downside, in John Wick his adversaries die by the hundreds; but it's Ok because nothing in the film feels particularly true to life. In Extraction, because it DOES feel real, the deaths of so many fighters made me ... sad. I couldn't help thinking; Don't their lives count for anything?Finally, why 8 stars and not 10? Here's why. No matter how good the fight scenes are, by a certain point I'd had enough. Maybe at one and three quarter hours out of the film's two hour length. Ok, I get it, I get the idea. Can we please wrap this up?Not a good reaction to what, to that point, had been great.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The primary villain needed some more motivating factors, but the film will make you hate him enough to root for anyone who stands against him.

The roads are basically dirt roads in this movie where Dhaka has one of the best road systems in the Country. Dhaka doesn't have that kinda dense jungle anywhere near the city, certainly not near the Buriganga river.The criminal class in Bangladesh is completely different.

They are trying to portray the elite force of Bangladesh, Known as Rapid Action Battalion. They are not regular police. They deal with counter-terrorism and similar stuff. It should've been the police that deals with criminal or action in the street. Police vehicles are wrong. Don't get me wrong, the entire movie is brilliantly shot and exceptionally action-packed. But this provides a complete misrepresentation of Bangladesh, as well as the city of Dhaka. People who don't have an idea about Bangladesh will get a false sense for a beautiful country by the misrepresented set of this movie.And finally the accents. the accent of the locals are wrong, they are speaking in an accent that's commonly used in West Bengal, India.

It is really very action-packed. Chris does everything, he gets shot, beaten up, even hit by a car, he bleeds and gets injuries but he just keeps going. No one can stop him. The same must be true about the camera man, who must have danced around the fist fights and run after the characters - this is how it looks at least. It seemed very realistic, I can't remember seeing anything like this before. It was like being in the same room with the actors and really standing next to them when they were fighting each other.
The last couple of scenes were not necessary in my opinion, but it didn't harm the film and maybe, will there be a sequel?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Knowing this fact, I was expecting some John Wick level action sequences and Extraction did not disappoint in that regard. The action was fresh, intense and beautifully choreographed. The 11+ minute tracking scene is exciting, even for those who aren't film nerds. Hargrave clearly had a vision for how he wanted this film to look and handled some huge action set pieces with extreme precision. This film definitely borrowed heavily from the John Wick series, and to a lesser extent The Raid. It wasn't quite as good as either, but with the right expectations this is a highly enjoyable, fast paced film. Sure, the plot is fairly thin with a handful of thinly developed side characters, but that's ok since everything else was done pretty dang well. Could this be a franchise for Chris Hemsworth? I wouldn't mind seeing another film in this world.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. Action scenes are fast paced, realistic, exciting and have that Bourne feeling to them. The setting is not your usual location either being in Asia (India) for this type of film either, which is usually South America. Chris Hemsworth proves he can be more than just Thor (who he plays brilliantly I add). The ending was unconventional too, it's happy but not the predictable type of ending you see in most action films, it has heart and makes you feel a connection to the characters and why they are doing some of the things they are. Overall a good action film made by Netflix.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I would have liked to see ""for certain"" that the man standing at the edge of the swimming pool, was in fact, Tyler Rake.

That for me is a lot for a movie like this, enough to feel something with each fight scene. Films like this benefit from simple stories so that it gets to focus more on the characters and action. Logan, The last of us, stories like those involving a badass taking care of someone who needs their help dont have convoluted storylines that would just ruin it.

However, it is different, but only in the most miserable sense...Sure it's gun play is video game sharp (that's where my points for the film score), but it's soul is entirely borrowed, and never quite felt. So, hundreds of faceless, in this case Bangladeshi, people wiped out by a dubiously motivated white super soldier mercenary is always a horribly regrettable cliché of modern cinema. Bears absolutely no comparison to any historic reality. Unlike the gun violence in the USA, Bangladesh is simply not a gun toting country of child gangs and lawless gunplay. Famously, a warm and welcoming country, and rightly or wrongly, a pretty sedate, and ordered society. Not without it's problems, but nothing like this portrayal.So, regrettably, without local precedent, it becomes a relentless slog of just killing. Human destruction, nihilism of the worst kind. I actually hoped Hemsworth would stop early on, and the film would make more intelligent choices not his choice of course. He was funny in the Thors, but Brad Pitt he ain't.... Wink wink... Of course it didn't change, more faceless bodies piled up, urgh.Its essentially a complete video game fantasy for middle Americans, translated to film. Murdering the foreigners, just an impotent bedroom fantasy about death and murder, and not much else. Morbid fantasy for gamers, nothing for mankind. You know, set one in the USA for once, mow down the cops in scores, break some special forces necks. No? See you at the box office....","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Extraction is another sad tale of how you play with the expectation of the common people after a gargantuan success like the Avengers. Chris Hemsworth has been portrayed as a mercenary who has literally killed more than a thousand soldiers in this movie. Was it that necessary to forget every logic while making an action film? If you have ample time in your hand and your Netflix subscription has been lying unused for a month, you may watch this. But never watch this piece of ... with any expectation.

Directed by Sam Hargrave and starring the magnetic Chris Hemsworth, this action-packed thriller is an exhilarating experience that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats from start to finish.From the very first frame, Extraction immerses us in a world of high-stakes danger and intense action. The film's breathtakingly choreographed fight sequences and jaw-dropping stunt work are a testament to the skill and dedication of the entire production team. Each blow, each gunshot, and each chase is executed with precision, resulting in a visceral experience that will leave action enthusiasts thoroughly satisfied.Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of Tyler Rake, a battle-hardened mercenary with a troubled past, is a standout performance that solidifies his status as a leading action star. Hemsworth brings a raw intensity and physicality to the role, infusing Rake with a captivating mix of strength and vulnerability. His commitment to the character is palpable, making us root for him even in the most desperate of situations.In addition to Hemsworth's gripping performance, Extraction features a strong supporting cast that adds depth to the narrative. Randeep Hooda delivers a memorable turn as Saju, a conflicted character caught between loyalty and self-preservation. The chemistry between Hemsworth and Hooda on-screen is electric, heightening the tension and emotional stakes of their interactions.One of the film's strengths lies in its ability to balance its heart-pounding action with moments of quiet introspection. Amidst the chaos and violence, there are poignant and emotionally resonant scenes that provide a glimpse into the human side of these characters. This balance adds depth and complexity to the story, elevating Extraction beyond a simple action flick.Visually, Extraction is a treat for the eyes. The film takes us on a thrilling journey through the gritty streets of Dhaka, immersing us in its vibrant and atmospheric setting. The cinematography is skillfully executed, capturing both the frenetic energy of the action sequences and the quieter, more introspective moments with equal finesse.At its core, Extraction is a story about redemption and sacrifice. It explores the complexities of human nature and the lengths one is willing to go to find purpose and redemption. The screenplay by Joe Russo, filled with tense and gripping moments, keeps the audience engaged and invested in the outcome of the characters' journeys.In conclusion, Extraction is a pulse-pounding action extravaganza that delivers on all fronts. With its expertly executed action sequences, captivating performances, and a well-crafted narrative, the film is a must-watch for fans of the genre. Sam Hargrave's directorial debut is a triumph, and Chris Hemsworth's portrayal of Tyler Rake is a tour de force. Brace yourself for a thrilling ride that will leave you breathless and eager for more.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Of course the plot is a recycled one but hey! Recycling is good right?Chris Hemsworth plays a mercenary who is hired to rescue the kidnapped son of an imprisoned crime lord.
It's a simple premise. One that's been reincarnated many times before but rarely as entertaining as this.
The Russo brothers of 'Avengers' fame produce with first time director Sam Hargrave at the helm.
I say first time. Hargrave has directed several short films but this is his first feature film.
A renowned stuntman and stunt coordinator. Hargraves has crafted a fine action movie with 'Extraction'. His expertise shine through with some of the best hand to hand combat scenes this side of 'John Wick'.
There's a beautifully shot car chase in which the camera stays in the car so we the audience feel like a passenger. There really is some marvellous direction of action here.
The film maybe basic but the fascinating camera work is certainly a cut above.
After this I can see Hargrave's being in big demand.
He knows how to get the best out of his actors too.
Hemsworth is in full badass mode and sells every single punch.
Apart from his excellent performances as Thor, he's never been better.
Hemsworth has the talent, charisma and physic to follow in the footsteps of Sly and Arnie.
There's not too many genuine action stars anymore. Chris Hemsworth is totally believable onscreen and it's clear like Keanu Reeves he's doing most of the arse kicking himself and not relying on a trained martial artist or stuntman.Presented in Dolby Vision on Netflix, 'Extraction' is a visual treat.
It boasts a 4K crisp image.
There's absolutely no film grain which allows for a digitally crisp picture.
Detail is very strong with sweat and grime visible in every pore. Close ups reveal every hair strand and blood soaked clothing as fine texture.
The movie has a amber coloured filter making the whole look of the movie feel hot, sweaty and gritty.If the visuals are good then we should have a great sound mix to accompany it right?
Well rest assured that the Dolby Atmos mix that is available for those rocking a dedicated home theatre system is one of the best Netflix has to offer.
There's plenty going on up top with helicopters and bullets wizzing overhead.
In ceiling or height speakers will have to work hard.
Surround sound effects are constant. Ambience or action, there's always something finding its way around the soundstage.
LFE is rich and punchy.
Gunshots have a realistic thud whilst mid range sound is crisp as depleted shells bounce off the floor.
My only gripe with the sound mix is that the centre channel, particularly dialogue could become muddled from time to time causing me to raise my centre speaker by a few dB.
All in all this movie offers a fine surround sound experience.
The action scenes are demo worthy.
The film itself was a joyous surprise and one that those with a Netflix subscription should definitely check out.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

A few years back Paul Greengrass gave the Bourne series a very realistic style that even quite successful really never was repeated out of B movies that rarely get distributed in theatres (John Wick the exception).
Now Netflix as produced a really good one, that keeps and sometimes even perfect the Greengrass style with a lower budget but in very exotic scenarios with (apparently) one long takes (handheld cameras ) action scenes, almost in first person that rarely seeing (or never) in latest movies.
Forget the story; it is quite simple; as it was Die Hard or the Bourne, but the action and quick characters definition is so good that you even care about them in the middle of the bullets and infinite deads.
Suspend your disbelief (as you has to with the digitally enhanced Disney movies ) and prepare to enjoy a outstanding stuntworks, shootings and knife fights as the old good movies had.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Chris Hemsworth is a nice action ""hero"" and delivers as bad-ass ex-soldier fighting dozens of opponents.
The story is not really worth mentioning. Its kind of a mix-up of Taken and John Wick. And well it just works totally fine. The focus on well crafted action cinematography is superb. Especially fun is the 12 minute one-take, which moves from a car chase, to a house raid, to really intense close-quarter fights, much in a John Wick style.
For me the movie works just fine. I did not expect more, and you should not to, If you like action with style and brutality, definitely watch it. If not leave it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However I was pleasantly surprised by just how exhilarating it was! It doesn't do anything we haven't seen before but I watched it straight off the back of watching John Wick 4 and I have to say I much preferred this! (Watching a steadily older and slower Keanu writhing around on the floor with his legs wrapped around someone is becoming a bit boring for me) I like that Rake is an action hero who accumulates damage as the film progresses giving the impression that he's a real mercenary and not some run of the mill super soldier one man army. Plotwise it was surprisingly well thought out and I enjoyed all of the side characters (although the old boy with the sniper rifle whilst a visually interesting character could have been fleshed out a bit more) the film starts relatively slow but once Hemsworth gets to the safe house and it all kicks off the movie moves along at a breakneck pace.

When one stands out among the rest though, I feel that a huge round of applause is in order. Extraction is one of Netflix's latest feature films to hit their service and it's probably my favourite film that they've released since last year's Oscar contenders. No, I'm not saying Extraction is award-worthy, but it's quite a ride. If you're looking for something new to watch, I think you'll be pleased with this one, even though some may find it too violent.This film follows a badass mercenary who's looking for his next big job in order to keep his mind off a troubled past. Being recruited to track down and extract a kidnapped teenager, who's father is in prison, this mission becomes his most difficult one yet. Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is the brain and the brawn of this story and if he doesn't work as a character, the entire film would fall apart. Now, even though there is some care put into the emotional moments, Extraction is all about the action. If you're not a fan of too much violence or too much action, then I suggest looking elsewhere.Directed by stuntman Sam Hargrave, who has done many of the stunts for the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, pulls no punches in dropping you right into the action. From long single takes with fantastic fight choreography to the brutal amount of deaths throughout the movie, Hargrave, even though this was his first major outing as a director, was clearly the man for the job. Written by Joe Russo, I felt even more enticed to watch it, and while there's nothing all that groundbreaking about the script itself, it has enough character development to serve the action overall. I feel that Joe Russo could write a few more films that are heavy on the action because it seemed to work here.If I were to explain everything that happens throughout this movie, you'd think I'm describing something else you've already seen, but I really appreciated the fact that the incredible action scenes made this movie stand out. On top of that, Chris Hemsworth and Rudhraksh Jaiswal, who plays the kidnapped Ovi Mahajan, have some nice moments together. There are a few humorous lines to break the tension and a couple heartfelt interactions that gave the film time to breathe. I personally really enjoyed watching this one.In the end, as I said, Extraction won't be winning any awards and it definitely doesn't hold back in the body count area, so if that's not your thing, it may not be for you. For myself, I like a good action movie with likeable characters and this movie delivered on that for me. Sure, things feel underdeveloped and the film unfolds as you would expect it to, but it's all about the action and it absolutely delivers. Purely on an entertainment scale, I didn't have a lot of issues with Extraction, because I truly don't believe it was trying to be anything new in terms of storytelling. As long as you're okay with violence, I recommend checking this one out on Netflix.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But in the murky underworld of weapons dealers and drug traffickers, an already deadly mission approaches the impossible.""Starts off with the usual action trope: at the end, and then cuts to a few days earlier. I didn't have much hope for the rest of the film. However, it surprised me. The film had jaw dropping action scenes, heartwarming moments, some funny scenes and when the films climax came about you were really in the moment with the main characters.The action scenes are masterfully done with some jaw dropping stunts and great fight scenes. The chase scenes are likewise amazingly done with the camera flitting from the main characters to the chasers, passersby, and others driving the chase forward in a unique way which was amazing to watch.Would have marked it a full 10/10 were it not for a few predictable moments which you saw coming a mile off and saddened me for the fact they'd still use movie plot devices like that knowing that we, the audience, have seen it time and time again and spoils the movie when you predict it yourself. Saying that, it balanced well with other scenes where it totally surprised you and left your mouth hanging open with awe.Overall, an amazing film which doesn't fail to keep you rooted to the edge of your seat. Chris Helmsworth, as usual is at his best. What a rush! Loved it from start to finish. Would definitely recommend","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Character development takes a long time given the structure of the teleplay. The character played by David Harbour is mostly unnecessary except to facilitate a leap in the character of the kidnapped boy.

There are lots of intense shoot outs and chase scenes which are directed perfectly and the fight choreography is sometimes impressive. The camera follows a lot of the carnage close up which makes the action feel tight and claustrophobic, However it never uses bad editing or the annoying shaky cam effect. Chris Hemsworth is badass as the main character but he is just a pretty generic action hero that you've seen a hundred times before. The rest of the cast do a good job and there are a few surprisingly good characters. The story is pretty straight forward but it has a few unexpected moments which adds more tension to the film.
Overall if you've seen the trailer and are looking for edge of your seat action you won't be disappointed but you won't be blown away by the story either. It's a really good Netflix film and if it comes out on Blu-Ray I would definitely add it to my collection.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is his first outing in the extraction franchise and like Denzel's equalizer, and Keanu's wick, Chris does not disappoint in any way. What seems to be a difficult child rescue turns into an all out war for Chris as he battles wave upon wave of viscous mercenaries as he weaves his way through to victory. The ending is a bit misleading and gives the impression he dies, but I won't say what happened. Great outing for Chris , I'm sure he wished he had Thor's abilities and hammer in this one but he's only a mortal. No questionable content or nudity whatsoever, the movie is focused on the plot and keeps you on your seat throughout. Great fun. Enjoy! Thor at his badass best.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There are two major accents of Bangla/Bengali, Bangladeshi accents and Indian accent. Clearly Bangladeshis dont speak in Indian accents but all these character who have spoken the language, used indian accent. Bollywood songs were playing in the households which is not a thing in Bangladesh.
They said Dhaka is surrounded by rivers, which is not totally true. Also there are jungle in the outskirts of the city they said, in reality there are none. Also a kind reminder that this movie highlights the control of a drug lord over the country as he can even manage the armed forces which is a joke. Because drug dealing and drug business is a lot less in bangladesh even less than usa, or other developed countries. Drug is not an issue here. An all powerful drug lord is far from reality. Nearly impossible stunts are at its best which makes me laugh while watching. Also the yellow filter seemed disturbing.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

There is little to no plot, but nobody watches action movies for plot right?

This movie is a Netflix original action thriller and it stars the actors; Chris Hemsworth and Rudhraksh Jaiswal. Although Chris Hemsworth in this movie is a very good actor, he is playing his character like Thor.Here is a brief overview of the plot without spoiling too much. A black-market mercenary (who has nothing to lose) is hired to rescue the kidnapped son of an imprisoned international crime lord. But in the murky underworld of weapons, dealers and drug traffickers, an already deadly mission approaches the impossible.This movie was very enjoyable to watch although personally, I think that at some points, the silence lasted for too long.

And thankfully, it has a good story to go with it. Even with so much of it, the action is exciting and so well-done that it never felt redundant. These sequences are violent, slick and show off some cool combat moves that will surely please action movie fans. The camera work is noticeably excellent. This is a movie that would have been great to watch on the big screen in a theater.Chris Hemsworth does an excellent job. The guy has more range than he likely gets credit for. And he's not the only one putting up a solid performance here. I was impressed with Rudhraksh Jaiswal who played the kidnapped son of a drug lord. He not only gives us a likable performance, but a very convincing one. With the beautiful score, which sounds very reminiscent of Hans Zimmer's Inception score, we get a nice emotional tone to go with all the explosions and gun fights. Why can't more Netflix action thrillers be this good?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Whenever I watch action/thriller genres of film, I prefer simple plots and this does just that. The story never feels heavy-handed nor do the minor subplots ever disrupt the flow of the film itself. Each of the lead characters are given just enough backstory to where you feel for them by the time the suspenseful climax comes around.2. The film is ultimately Chris Hemworth's to carry and he doesn't disappoint. You completely buy him as an action star and this film is undoubtedly the most physically intense and realistic action I have seen him do. Unlike Sylvester Stallone or Dwayne Johnson who are rather generic action stars, Hemsworth proves himself as also being a very formidable dramatic actor as well just by the sheer emotion he puts into his deeper characters including this one. All credit to Sam Hargrave as I was completely floored by his direction of each fight scene and the manner in which they were staged.3. Unfortunately, as much as I want to praise this film, there are problems that need to be addressed. For some reason, the krytoninte of many action films are the generic villains and this one is no different. Priyanshu Painyuli plays the rival kingpin Amir who is responsible for the kidnapping, but he never has a formidable presence or seems like a legit threat in the overall story to where the film feels like there is no real antagonist. The same goes for Golshifteh Farahani (Nik) as her character is never fully developed either. The real dynamic is ultimately between Hemsworth and Jaiswal.4. Unlike the 'Fast & Furious' franchise, the action never becomes unbelievably unrealistic or buffoonish to where it lost me. In fact, despite there not being anything new action-wise, the realism and the way the cinematographer captures it all is what has you most compelled. Its been a long time since I've felt such intensity and fear for certain characters during a climax especially within an action film. I should warn that there is a certain level of gore that may make some viewers squeamish as this type of action doesn't shy away from the graphic nature in which people are killed.Had this film been released in theaters, I would have gladly paid to seen it on the big screen. I understand these types of releases are usually decisive among critics, but if you love R-Rated action, this is by far one of the more better ones in recent years. Much congratulations to Sam Hargrave because I honestly can't wait for his next directorial feature.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There is no way this thing needs to go over 1h30min but clocks in at 1h56min, or in technical terms, too long. It's sort of the flip side of the old joke in which two people are talking about aa restaurant with bad food. ""And such small portions,"" one of them says. We have lousy movies that somehow think they will be better if they go on 20% longer.Yet another bloody kill-fest of wonton slaughter in which the protagonist seems to be immune to bullets while everyone else around him is a bullet magnet. Does this movie have as many senseless homicides as John Wick? Some other fool who can be bothered to watch all 1h56min of this piece of trash will have to answer than question.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

There were funny moments in Thor Ragnarock and it seems that this opened and hopefully closed the door on comedy.Now Extraction is for me Chris at his best.In summary a 14 year old boy is kidnapped by one drug barron who is son of another, his son lives with an employee his fathers (I'll come back to this later).Eventually we find out that no one wants Obi not even his own father so why did his father employ Chris Hemsworth to Extract him?The fathers friend who Obi lived with was then sent to kill Obi and Chris Hemseorth, why? Surely if he didn't want his son just simply don't pay the ransome, problem solved.So as you can see the story is silly especially as half way through the guy Obi was living with and who was out to kill them both suddenly decides to help, cone on!BUT.........As I've said above Chris Hemsworth has finally returned to what he does best, ACTION all the way!The 11 minute continuous scene starting with the car chase and escaping the corrupt police is absolutely amazing! How the camera transitions from inside to outside the car and following the action, one word WOW!Atomic Blonde did this but this film blew Atomic Blonde out of the water in my personal opinion and the action continue throughout the film.So forget the story and simply enjoy this film for what it is, an action packed movie with simply amazing camera work which has to be seen to believed.Rating 9 out of 10","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Not even body armor stops sniper rounds, and certainly nothing in his body would have either.Aside from that one point, this will be one of only a few dozen action movies that are worth re watching over and over.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However what keeps me from giving this a 9 or a 10 is they didn't spend a lot of time on the plot. The plot isn't entirely original but has enough unique aspects to be its own. But Hargave, the director, focused more on the action than the plot; this wasn't a bad choice at all as it kept the pace very high and again, the action was incredible; but I can't help but think the ending would have been a 10/10 if the relationship between Tyler and Ovi was more fleshed out.All in all the most enjoyable parts were the action and the shots, lots of great sequences.

"8","/10","As far as action movies go, Extraction is pretty good.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5692579/?ref_=tt_urv","sharar9811","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur55225619/?ref_=tt_urv","30 April 2020","Extraction is an action movie. It's supposed to have exaggerated close combats, gunfights, explosions etc. The movie is receiving a lot of hate from many reviews, claiming that it does not represent the true culture of Bangladesh. As a Bangladeshi, I beg to differ. As a action story mostly set in Dhaka, the movie accurately portrayed the setting in Dhaka. There's a few minor mistakes however. For example, the Bengali spoken is most that from West Bengal. Bangladeshi spoken Bengali is quite different. There's also a sequence in a jungle near the outskirts of Dhaka, but Dhaka is an urban area and is surrounded by other urban areas.As for the story, there are some plot holes. There's no clear motive that establishes why the kid was kidnapped. It's also ambiguous as to why the kid decided to start Chris Helmsworth's character blindly. There's also some awkward camera angles, but that could be forgiven as a directorial debut. The production design, stunt coordiation and visual effects were superb. Hope to see more movies set in Bangladesh in the future!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But frankly, this is not a documentary, the viewers knew what they were gonna see... The trailer didn't lie either. It's a fully action packed movie and there wasn't anything meant to be different either.
Don't know what people in Bangladesh think, do they believe it's always USA in movies like Avengers? No they shoot in Canadian cities where the actual setting is far better than US cities - just to give impression that superheroes stack up in the most developed corners of the world.
Similarly, this movie is not about covering the so called some of the Good Roads 😂😬 of Dhaka. It's just an action movie with a context of being shot in Bangladesh. Obviously they had to bring in fake police, combat squads etc guessing the Real Police of Dhaka won't have given directors the chance of bringing in that much action😆😆. Again this is what we see in every other Hollywood movie too - you think they are always so combat savvy and competent in real life in the West? No. The real NYPD, FBI, etc is surely good but movies just exxagerate everything everytime. This is no different.I give it 10 because they talked about action and extraction which were both there in the movie. The way done Avengers were shot was again brilliant. No complains.Peace ✌🏻✌🏻","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

He doesn't have to do a lot of speaking, and can just let his actions speak for themselves. Some of the stunt work in this film would not have been easy. When he is required to slow things down and have some dialogue in the odd scene he does so adequately.The film surprised me with just how violent it was willing to be at times, especially in scenes involving children. There were a couple of time where I thought - they're not going to do that are they? - and then sure enough they did. This is a very serious film as well. Very little (if any that I can think of) humour whatsoever makes an appearance.The film does get a little tedious towards the end. You can only watch so many people getting shot without becoming numb and a little bored by it. Also the film opens with a shot from near the end of the film. It doesn't work though because there is no intrigue behind it. This was one of the few poor choices an otherwise very good film made however. I would recommend giving this one a watch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Started watching with a good expectation but ended up in a nightmare. The director could have studied about the country & It's culture before shooting the movie. The story is extremely weak. Actors were expressionless. Only action scenes of Chris was worth watching. Sometimes it looked like he was playing call of duty though. Not recommended at all.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Hopefully, the sequel will be more fun, this lacks the wit within the action that John Wick has, which makes the huge kill count in those films bearable. By the end of this, the complete inability of the police and soldiers to hit anything was reaching A-Team levels of ridiculousness.

Just watched the Netflix special ""Extraction"" starring Chris Hemsworth. I am extremely disappointed with the HORRIBLE misrepresentation of Dhaka. Dhaka AND its law enforcers deserve a MUCH better portrayal in front of the world. Reasons below (no spoilers on the storyline). #ExtractionIsNotDhaka1. Children don't carry rifles on the streets of Dhaka in broad daylight. It's a horrible misrepresentation shown in the movie. If I didn't live in Dhaka myself, I would be mistaken into thinking child terrorism is normal in Dhaka.2. Law enforcers in Dhaka - whether it be DMP, RAB or any of the defense organizations - are NOT incompetent and incapable of stopping two random guys flying in from outside the country. They do their job well, which is why we can go out, visit places, hang out with friends and more without worrying about random shootings (like they show in the movie).3. Dhaka's streets are NOT violent and it's NOT normal for people to fight in public with guns and swords. The movie made it seem like the people are used to things like these happening and somehow it's the norm here.4. An entire movie set to be in Dhaka and not a SINGLE major Bangladeshi character played by someone who SPEAKS the language and dialect that we do in Bangladesh? Are you for real, Netflix? All the major characters spoke Bengali like they do in West Bengal / Kolkata - NOT how we speak in Bangladesh - although they were representing characters in Bangladesh. Why? My mother was an actress, a lot of my friends are too. I'm sure many Bangladeshi actors could do those roles better than any of the ones who did, WHILE speaking our language/dialect.Overall, it's a horrible misrepresentation of the country in front of the world by a cast which isn't even 1% Bangladeshi.

Typically, I can suspend logic when watching a movie. I am on the side of the movie makers, and WANT to believe what they are asking me to believe. I am a friend to movies. I'm rooting for them.
Optimism aside, this Netflix original is one of the poorest written stories offered by the streaming site to-date. It's endlessly loaded firearms, and the hero's penchant for the double-tap coup de grâce fighting style becomes lazy after a while. I have heard review that liken it to a John Wick-style, ultra-violent, revenge fantasy. The difference between the movies' approach to killing, however, could not be more different. John Wick lives in a dream-like word of paid assassins, where Extraction exists in a gritty, morally bankrupt reality. The story has very little, humor or heart. At last count, Chris Hemsworth's character kills 183 people. John Wick's body count is notoriously high as well, however, Wick's killing has context. He is getting his revenge. Extraction holds no such justification. In order to save one boy, there are hundreds of deaths. Where John Wick kills bad guys. Extraction, in stark contrast, kills police officers and military troops. Almost 200 kills for the life of one drug trafficker's son. I just don't buy it!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Since it's directed by stunt coordinator Sam Hargrave, I had a feeling the action would be impressive and indeed it was but everything else was lacking in comparison.Extraction follows Tyler Rake, a mercenary who goes on a deadly extraction mission where he has to rescue a huge crime lord's kidnapped son.The biggest enjoyment you can get from Extraction is the action sequences. I have to give a huge amount of credit to everyone who worked on the choreography of the action. All the action scenes are brutal and look very realistic. There is this incredible 10 minute sequence that looks like it's done in one take which is any action lover's dream. The camerawork and stunts during that scene are really well done. I can't imagine the amount of time that would've been invested just on that one scene. I wish I could say the same for the script.If you're going to watch this film for the plot and characters, then you will be disappointed. The Russo Brothers, who made films like Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, wrote the screenplay and it's pretty bad. Apart from the action, there is nothing else to it. We barely learn about Hemsworth's character and the relationship between him and Jaiswal was extremely underdeveloped. This made it so difficult for me to care about them especially the end where it mattered. David Harbour is in the film but he didn't get to do much. He was completely wasted. There wasn't much to the villain either. A movie like John Wick has great action scenes as well but at the same time there is a good amount of character development within it.Extraction is very forgettable. The action is commendable but I've seen better in films like John Wick and The Raid. Chris Hemsworth and Randeep Hooda were good but the material they had to work with had a lot left to be desired.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, they completely missed mark making the set in Dhaka.To start with, the accent of the locals are wrong, they are speaking in an accent that's commonly used in West Bengal, India. Dhaka and People in Bangladesh, in General, have a completely different accent. Throughout the movie, Hindi songs are heard in the background, where everyone is watching tv during midday. People go to work here, Dhaka is the capital, nobody sits on their asses watching TV midday. Bangladesh has its own music industry, although the movie had some issues acquiring copyright for some of the songs to play in the background.The environment is wrong. Sure Dhaka has slums and dirty places, but most of the city is developed enough with an actual nice road system. If they set the scene somewhere else in Bangladesh, it would've been more convincing. The roads are basically dirt roads in this movie where Dhaka has one of the best road systems in the Country. Dhaka doesn't have that kinda dense jungle anywhere near the city, certainly not near the Buriganga river.The criminal class in Bangladesh is completely different. This isn't Africa, people don't employ child soldiers here. And certainly carry AK-47 in hand and in the open.The Police uniform and looks are completely misjudged. They are trying to portray the elite force of Bangladesh, Known as Rapid Action Battalion. They are not regular police. The deal with counter-terrorism and similar stuff. It should've been the police that deals with criminal or action in the street. Police vehicles are wrong.Don't get me wrong, the entire movie is brilliantly shot and exceptionally action-packed. But this provides a complete misrepresentation of Bangladesh, as well as the city of Dhaka. People who don't have an idea about Bangladesh will get a false sense for a beautiful country by the misrepresented set of this movie.Reviewed by oritroahmed","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

There are several instances where the representation of Bangladesh's overall ambiance has been grossly misrepresented to global audiences. Firstly, Dhaka is depicted akin to war-torn, economically distressed regions like Iraq or Syria, which is far from the reality. Secondly, the constant portrayal of the police and army engaged solely in combating terrorism fosters a fictitious narrative. Thirdly, evident errors such as misspelling 'Bengali' on the poster, the exaggerated prominence of auto-rickshaws in the streetscape, inadequate portrayal of the Bengali language by Dhaka's criminals, and the misrepresentation of Dhaka residents' lifestyle and character as resembling those from another country are disconcerting. Such oversights raise questions about the director's attention to detail and cultural sensitivity.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I am extremely disappointed with the HORRIBLE misrepresentation of Dhaka. Dhaka AND its law enforcers deserve a MUCH better portrayal in front of the world. Reasons below (no spoilers on the storyline). #ExtractionIsNotDhaka1. Children don't carry rifles on the streets of Dhaka in broad daylight. It's a horrible misrepresentation shown in the movie. If I didn't live in Dhaka myself, I would be mistaken into thinking child terrorism is normal in Dhaka.2. Law enforcers in Dhaka - whether it be DMP, RAB or any of the defense organizations - are NOT incompetent and incapable of stopping two random guys flying in from outside the country. They do their job well, which is why we can go out, visit places, hang out with friends and more without worrying about random shootings (like they show in the movie).3. Dhaka's streets are NOT violent and it's NOT normal for people to fight in public with guns and swords. The movie made it seem like the people are used to things like these happening and somehow it's the norm here.4. An entire movie set to be in Dhaka and not a SINGLE major Bangladeshi character played by someone who SPEAKS the language and dialect that we do in Bangladesh? Are you for real, Netflix? All the major characters spoke Bengali like they do in West Bengal / Kolkata - NOT how we speak in Bangladesh - although they were representing characters in Bangladesh. Why? My mother was an actress, a lot of my friends are too. I'm sure many Bangladeshi actors could do those roles better than any of the ones who did, WHILE speaking our language/dialect.Overall, it's a horrible misrepresentation of the country in front of the world by a cast which isn't even 1% Bangladeshi. People abroad don't know a whole lot about Dhaka, but after they watch this movie, they might get the wrong impression that Dhaka lacks law enforcement and is filled with violence.This is not my Dhaka, this is not any Dhaka.PS: This is my opinion on the movie, as someone who was actually born and brought up in Dhaka.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Bangladesh isn't a terrorist country. Its a peaceful country and its known over the world as peaceful country. Bangladesh armed police battalion is qualified enough to handover the kidnapped boy let alone RAB,ARMY, SSF, SWAT (Its a moral behavior practice in Bangladesh). Mostly There is nothing called elite force, There is no logo like red circle covered by green color, Only RAP wears black dress, Its impossible correlate the 'badge, logo, dress, police in the shoulder, and police car'.
2. Here is yellowish environment.
3. Here is no language that was spoken in the movie.
4. Here no people bears AK47 let alone a boy. It was just lame.
5. Here army police RAB helps to find out kidnapped boys until they die. Not fights against the logic and morality.
6. I don't know How non-citizen don can come here and even fight with the best troops like army. LOL.
7. Acton was awesome but it was for nothing. Without logic. Logic-less action look like very poor.
ufffffff i cant write more. Um just frustrated, tired and bored.Somehow it looks like director was miss-guided intentionally.

I am extremely disappointed with the HORRIBLE misrepresentation of Dhaka. Dhaka AND its law enforcers deserve a MUCH better portrayal in front of the world. Reasons below (no spoilers on the storyline). #ExtractionIsNotDhaka1. Children don't carry rifles on the streets of Dhaka in broad daylight. It's a horrible misrepresentation shown in the movie. If I didn't live in Dhaka myself, I would be mistaken into thinking child terrorism is normal in Dhaka.2. Law enforcers in Dhaka - whether it be DMP, RAB or any of the defense organizations - are NOT incompetent and incapable of stopping two random guys flying in from outside the country. They do their job well, which is why we can go out, visit places, hang out with friends and more without worrying about random shootings (like they show in the movie).3. Dhaka's streets are NOT violent and it's NOT normal for people to fight in public with guns and swords. The movie made it seem like the people are used to things like these happening and somehow it's the norm here.4. An entire movie set to be in Dhaka and not a SINGLE major Bangladeshi character played by someone who SPEAKS the language and dialect that we do in Bangladesh? Are you for real, Netflix? All the major characters spoke Bengali like they do in West Bengal / Kolkata - NOT how we speak in Bangladesh - although they were representing characters in Bangladesh. Why? My mother was an actress, a lot of my friends are too. I'm sure many Bangladeshi actors could do those roles better than any of the ones who did, WHILE speaking our language/dialect.Overall, it's a horrible misrepresentation of the country in front of the world by a cast which isn't even 1% Bangladeshi. People abroad don't know a whole lot about Dhaka, but after they watch this movie, they might get the wrong impression that Dhaka lacks law enforcement and is filled with violence.This is not my Dhaka, this is not any Dhaka","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is a black market mercenary who takes the mission to extract Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) from a powerful crime lord and return him to his father.REVIEW:
Not a huge fan of this one. I didn't rate this one too low, because there's potential at certain moments of the film. For example, there is a very cool continuous shot sequence near the beginning of the film when Tyler is in the process of extracting Ovi. The driving was a little distracting since you could get clearly tell he wasn't driving (I know that's obvious, but it shouldn't look obvious). A couple issues I had with the film is the sporadic writing and with the end of this film. There's also a female character, Nik, (Golshifteh Farahani) who seems to be close with Tyler, but there's no explanation of their past. They did announce working on a sequel, so maybe they'll explain there, but I digress. Wasn't my biggest qualm with the film. For me, that came with the end of the film. I understand dragging emotional sequences out, but when someone should be dead, they should die. Not everyone is Superman out here. There's only one to my knowledge. Maybe there are more supermen. Maybe this was a Superman prequel idk. Either way, the film wasn't horrible, but I'm not itching for that sequel. 5.9/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"1","/10","Action becomes boringly routine, no plot, unfair to Bangladesh","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5692902/?ref_=tt_urv","winsor-30098","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur69898961/?ref_=tt_urv","30 April 2020","I didn't have high expectations for this movie, but I figured a Chris Hemsworth action pic would provide a couple hours of diverting of pulp entertainment.
Where did it go wrong for me?
The action scenes were well choreographed with lots of fiery explosions, chases & hand to hand combat etc, but about half way through the film it got to the point where it became cartoonish & mechanical. The swarms of bad guys were inept & couldn't shoot straight to the point where it was hard to believe our hero was in any real danger, whatever the odds. It all became very predicable & mind numbing.
The plot is weak, even for pulp. The story revolves around a kidnapping, the reason for which is never really established. Hemsworths character is a walking ""mercenary with a painful past"" cliché. The quiet, intimate scenes meant to show his humanity are painfully, awkwardly done, as unbelievable as the overdone action sequences and feel like pro forma filler. Too many unbelievable coincidences. Very senseless & disjointed.
Having said all that, I might have given this film a ""5"" as an action pic if it wasn't for its arbitrary and misleading setting in Bangladesh. As I watched the film I kept thinking that the portrayal of the of city Dhaka is very harsh. Criminals controlling the army & police, a dirty, filthy city, gangs roaming the streets, including kids with AKs - basically Somalia at its worst. And wondered why would Bangladesh allow a film to be shot in Dhaka when it portrays it in such a negative light?
Well, the answer I soon learned is that this film was written, produced and shot in India by Indians and there are no Bengalis at all in the cast. Now there's no reason the plot couldn't have been set in a city in India, other than of course the Indian producers didn't want one of their own cities to be shown as dirty, dangerous, violent, lawless and corrupt. So they moved the whole thing next door to Bangladesh. Never mind that there's no objective evidence that Dhaka is anything like it's portrayed in the film, or for that matter, any worse than cities in India. Just dump the whole dirty, lawless mess on the people across the border.
I have to wonder if the fact that India now has a Hindu nationalist led government and Bangladesh is 90% Muslim played a factor in all this too.
Thumbs down on Netflix and Chris Hemsworth for their association with this tainted picture.
(BTW, I have no personal connection to either country.)","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Not only they dropped the ball on recreating Dhaka city, somewhere in India, the plot also has major conveniences. In a movie where you have the titular stars like Chris Hemsworth, David Harbour and critically acclaimed actors like Randeep Hooda and Pankaj Tripathi ( I would call it a cameo), a little more research on the place where most of the story takes place would have been more appreciated. Indonesia sure knows how to make a badass action flick with lesser known cast and half the budget. I would rather prefer The Night Comes For Us among Netflix's action packed offerings.
This movie is only watchable as a one time pop corn flick as it does not have too many redeeming qualities.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The maker literally didn't do any homework about the locations, as a result, Poor and fake locations.3rd: The actors who played the characters of Bangladeshi people, they can't speak Bangla at all; their accents are like a joke for more than 210 million Bangla speaking people around the world.4th: The movie yellow color makes it worst to watch peacefully, it seems like we are watching Mexico with the name Dhaka.5th: The funniest part of the movie and most appreciated part of the movie is its actions. The movie has great action but which makes no sense at all.

I thought the characterisation was barely noticeable. You don't learn much about them and when they're being sad or determined, the viewer hasn't been put in a position to empathize with them.
Chris Hemsworth was a decent enough actor for a 'merc' but the part needed a lot more fleshing out in the script to make his character have more prestige. In other words, he needed a (better) backstory, a clearer motive and a personality!The narrative felt like it was pasting tropes from other movies it had copied from.

No problem with any characters face they all look like Bangladeshi the problem is accent.

(3 stars for that)(1 stars for that)Cons:
(- 2 stars for each so -6 stars in total)* A movie portraying recent time should be portraying the recent scenario of the city portrayed. There comes the whole disappointment. Not as a Bangladeshi but as movie freak I am saying this. If you are showing a part of city it is okay to portray as however one wants but if the whole city is portrayed it should be taken into consideration how it should be portrayed. In this movie whole Dhaka is shown as slam/dirty area with narrow lanes which is definitely funny and ridiculous. Yes it is over populated but the whole city is not based on old buildings and narrow lanes or smelly sewer. Only the part of old town has old buildings with narrow lanes.* Dhaka is not a post war country and children do not run with guns in open streets, they dont even carry guns in a hidden manner and they are not part of gangs for sure.* Even if it is considered the whole armed forces are corrupt in a country but what about the background story for that one? I don't know, they might have plan to produce another movie for the past story.
In movie there is no local showed to help the character Tyler or Saju which is actually a serious negative side according to me. For Saju how he entered inside Dhaka without help form someone how he crossed border with arms and without security people knowing that is a mystery.* We all know the difference of English accent between UK and USA, what if a movie story is based on USA and the actors portraying USA locals are using UK accent, how horrible does that sound?
Same has happened in this movie (Except these two character: Dhaka Elite force Commander and Farhad), even the character portraying Dhaka Drag Lord, Amir Asif cannot speak proper Bangla, how funny is that?) The other actors portraying Dhaka goons are using West Bengal accent (Part of india, Bangla is their mother tongue too) which is too much different than the actual accent of Bangladeshi one.*Then comes background songs used in the scene.
All the songs played on background are Hindi (Might have been copyright issues but there are too many West Bengal produced Bangla Music?)
Seriously? this is the research of a movie team!!!!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I have been living in Dhaka City ( the real one) for last 36 years. After watching the movie, I think i should speak for my city.1. Movie casting was very good. Chris Hemsworth, Randeep Hooda , the kid everyone showed their skills while the director completely lacks his. It is not DHAKA AT ALL. I really doubt if they have seen the city even by google.
2. "" Sultana Kamal Bridge"" is way ahead from Dhaka city.
3.The accent heard in background seems absolutely wrong- I have never ever heard of this accent enywhere in Bangladesh for the last 36 years - I am also wondering how it occured.
4. Bollywood songs in background (which is also pretty old, like 90's) might confuse the viewer as well. We have our own music.
5. Children were shown in the street carrying guns and using foul languages- really? Which Dhaka is it?
6. Finer detail- the city environment, bakcground activity, vehicle models used for the movie- nothing matches Bangladesh even- let alone "" Dhaka City"".Bottom liine-
The movie lacks its context completely. Dhaka is a peaceful city.
Overcrowded ? - yes.
Heavy Traffic ?- yes
Air Pollution ? - yes
Noisey? - yes
But it is vibrant in its own way- much safer than many cities of the world. We can find child begger in the street - but definitely not terrorist.I suggest anyone related to this movie should type "" Dhaka"" in Google or Wikipedia. They have more information - especially authentic one.I sincerely apologise for my comments above if it hurts anyone. Any city shown in any movie should reflect its own character - imagination shall be there for sure- but definitely not out of context .","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

Disney owns a huge chunk of this business with childhood fare: remakes of their cartoons, MCU superheroes, etc. Not only have these new dynamics largely squeezed out the mid-budget drama from multiplexes, but also the traditional, usually stand-alone, macho action flicks such as ""Extraction,"" and ""Bright"" (2017), and ""Triple Frontier,"" and ""Red Sea Diving Resort,"" and ""6 Underground"" (all 2019). Now, if it's not already part of a series, chances are you'll only get this lack-of-a-brand type of adrenaline injection from streaming services and at home. Unfortunately, ""Extraction"" is a mostly generic burger of a movie from MCU veterans taking a break before making ""Avengers 83,"" or whatever.Stunt choreographer Sam Hargrave gets a chance to direct, and his background in filming fighting moves, along with the similar skills of the Russo brothers and Thor himself, Chris Hemsworth, shows. The next movie I saw after this one was ""Angel Has Fallen"" (2019), and it's painfully clear that the makers here put care into their craft, whereas the hacks behind the other one, despite it getting a wide theatrical release before making its way to Netflix, were merely there to cash checks. So, I do appreciate the action scenes here--especially the virtuoso, lengthy one-shot car chase.Otherwise, though, ""Extraction"" is a lousy entry in the trope of the White Savior. Others have commented how poorly the picture represents Dhaka, which just demonstrates how little filmmakers of white-savoir rubbish care about depicting the racial other. Narratively, only the white male hero's journey is made to matter--how sympathetic he is to the supposed plight of the Oriental, as opposed to their actual state of affairs or characterizations. Blah, I prefer my white-savior myths to have some knowing humor and time-traveling, purple Malthusian giants. If for little else, ""Extraction"" is helpful for realizing how much I miss fat Thor.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

The kidnapper apparently controls the entire army, elite forces and police of a nation. If that is not ridiculous enough, the mercenary shoots these trained soldiers down like flies (probably around 100 of them single-handedly). Yep we are supposed to believe these trained individuals cannot shoot straight and are no match for a mercenary. Apparently a nation's defense forces are the villains and we are supposed to sympathise with a mercenary and a drug lord's son!Morale of the story: you can be a hero if you are a mercenary or drug lord's son, no need to sign up for the armed forces because they are just inept.

Bangladesh film industry has much better actors for the villain's role, at least 1000 times better than the chick shown in the film who could've easily easily helped the director to portray a 'Dhakaiya drug king'Roads, Dusts, Slums are from Kolkata and Kolkata suits best for all those, directors could have easily used Kolkata as it naturally goes with the movie.Most importantly, Dhaka's elite forces (Police, RAB, Army follows the command of a Drug king 😀😂😂😂)
What a Joke...!! Could've easily used thousand random gang members of the drug dealer in place of those uniformed clowns who actually resembles national defence of a country.What was the point of highlighting and developing plot surrounding Dhaka and Bangladesh where almost nothing matched exactly.Tyler and co. went all in for just money, rescued, came to know that they were played & won't get paid, his dead son comes in mind and rescues for the humanity 👏
When his own son died, his humanity didn't rise, he escaped so that he doesn't need to watch his son dying in-front of him. So, getting the air of Dhaka he became a good 'mercenary'? This part even destroyed the overall weights of the Tyler's character.Successfully wasted my times watching this and now reviewing this as well.My rating is 4/10 only for Chris Helmsworth & Randip Hooda's inhuman efforts.

They don't have that kind of crime lords in that country and there is no violence over there as shown in the movie. I understand it's Hollywood but you can't misrepresent a country like that. It's NOT a fictional country like "" Wakanda "". You can't hurt peoples emotion and love for their country. You have to remember, Bangladesh is one of the biggest contributor of United Nations peacekeeping mission for a long time.Ohh... I forgot... The movie... No... Not worth watching. No story, average action. If you like Steven Seagal or his movies ( i don't know if anybody does ) then you might like it. Just like Steven Seagal's movies, there's a lot of camera movement but not much of actual acting or action happening there. They just tried to make the scenes epic by moving their cameras like crazy instead of letting the actors actually act.
Overall, if you are looking for a good or maybe OK movies, it's not a movie you want to watch.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

If you want a movie with similar plot lines and scenery based on a real person, actual complex characters with layered acting, decent action and lots of intensity and good twists in the plot, I recommend another Netflix original ""Close"" with Noomi Rapace (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) and great supporting by Sophie Nélisse (The Book Thief). It's criminally underrated for one being a female action drama/thriller which people will always be nitpicking about opposite movies like this one starting out at a solid 7.4. What? That's higher rating than Die Hard 2 and almost the same as Skyfall. Not to get started on ""6 Underground"" coming in with 6.1 solid stars with its big names not even making up for the lack of so many quality-based things, putting an emphasis on ""empty action and looks"". Really gonna continue to do this, are we?
Watch this one if you want decent action and with a big-named celebrity, not really caring about anything else. Then you'll be satisfied for sure.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I think the Russo brothers are trading on their work for Marvel and have probably let the success of Endgame go to their heads in making them believe that they can only pick 'winners' from here on out.Overall, the film has some good action but I was disappointed with it and it does feel like children running around a playground shouting 'you're dead' and 'you didn't take your shots'.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

There was no real connection between any character. The plot was very straightforward. Only the production design team and the action stunts can be appreciated in this movie.
The way the movie portrayed Bangladesh was very unaccurate. Bangladeshi people do not talk or behave like that. The teenage gangs, cops and elite force they showed were completely unrealistic. The research team should have done a little bit more research on the location where the story is actually happening. If it was a country like Afghanistan or Somalia, it could be accepted.
At the end, the movie was too predictable and not a single moment I saw any real plot twist or a scene to say ""wow"".","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

there has a lot of action in the movie that take in dhaka city but i think the director have no idea about the city, because if a rabit run into the city, then the whole people use their camera to take photo or selfie and the fighting scene happened but no people take a look. how is this possible?
In the whole action scene there are playing Hindi song but dhaka have it's own tardition song and they should use some of them.

He has some responsibilities. These increases when he goes for an international product. Apart from something which makes a movie a complete entertaining package, My heading says many issues which are as follows:
1. Bangladesh (BD) is country of 16 crore +...So, you understand how much it will be in terms of movie viewers number. The movie portrayed BD like Syria, Afghanistan or a war wrecked State which is disgrace for us. Because BD is not such.The stuntman (Director) should have some background studies which hadn't. Because he is a stuntman!
2. He couldn't portrayed our law agencies properly and made whatever just he liked.
3. He could not portrayed Dhaka. Because he tried to do it from Ahmedabad, India.
4. There is distinct difference between the Bengali language of BD & India as it's between US & UK English language in terms of pronunciation. Someone apart from Bengalis may not understand it. The stuntman tried to establish Indian Bengali language as BD Bengali language with lot of spelling mistakes of Bengali language which made the background as unrealistic one.
5. It's obvious that the Stuntman took idea from Someothers not from BD to portray BD as he didn't come here. This made the blunder and has defamed my country.
6. You will need a microscope to find out a man having 4 wives in BD. It may be possible in Middle East. But it's reflected in the movies.This is how he tried to defame BD muslim culture.Thereby I am grading this movie 1/10.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Whole through the movie they have used yellow lence effect during Dhaka shoot to give a polluted vibe. It looks like dhaka people are devastated and this city has no law and order at all. Child terrorism was projected like a poison burn.
Our armed forces are not impotent as long as they are alive in this soil. They will not leave an inch like Pakistan did even ....what to talk about police ,Rab!! Producer have not visited Dhaka city ever I guess,what to talk about Cantonment.

Despite featuring notable actors, the movie fails to rise above its generic storyline and lacks the depth and originality needed to make it memorable.The film stars Chris Hemsworth in the lead role, known for his portrayal of Thor in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Hemsworth brings his physicality and charisma to the character, but unfortunately, the weak script does not allow him to fully shine. His performance feels one-dimensional and lacks the necessary emotional depth to make the audience truly invest in his character.The supporting cast includes actors such as Rudhraksh Jaiswal, Randeep Hooda, and Golshifteh Farahani, who deliver competent performances despite the limited material they are given. However, their characters feel underdeveloped and fail to leave a lasting impression. The lack of compelling character arcs further hinders the film's ability to engage the audience on an emotional level.The action sequences in ""Extraction"" are the film's saving grace. They are well-choreographed and feature some impressive stunts and fight sequences. However, even these intense moments of action cannot compensate for the film's overall shortcomings. The story is formulaic and predictable, lacking the necessary twists and turns to keep viewers genuinely interested.Furthermore, the pacing of the film feels uneven. While the action scenes provide some excitement, they are often interrupted by dull and unnecessary dialogue sequences that do little to advance the plot. This inconsistency hampers the film's ability to maintain a consistent level of tension and engagement.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

After successfully completing this mission, he finds the kidnappers aren't as willing to relinquish their hostage as he'd hoped, plunging him into a deadly battle through the streets of Dhaka, where everything is not as it seems, and he can trust no one.As cinemas around the country (and the world, of course) are closed in the lockdown, streaming services like Netflix are going to be more popular than ever, as people, and certainly film lovers, will crave the sense of escapism that the filmic experience provides even more than they usually do. And, indeed, the main function of a film like Extraction will be to escape to another world, because there will never be any sense of realism in some action film where one man takes on a whole bunch of villains and defeats them without getting a scratch, the ones popularised so greatly throughout the 80s and 90s. Which the feature length directorial debut of Sam Hargrave ultimately emerges as one, big generic regurgitation of.Hargrave saturates everything with the standard present day dark, moody style, with a gloomy, blurred shooting style, setting the overall tone for the film itself. If it hadn't been so heavy and humourless, and a little shorter and less self indulgent, it could have passed as a harmless, run of the mill actioner, something to nod off to late at night, but instead it's one big, overblown event that seems to be stabbing at something deeper. Hemsworth is effective and convincing as an action hero, there's a depressingly authentic recreation of the Indian slums and it livens up at the end, with some pretty decent action, but it all amounts to the same thing.There's an Aladdin's cave of these type of movies in the back catalogue of films from the 80s and 90s, and there's plenty you can seek out, which will be over and done with much quicker and give you much the same experience. Usually starring Steven Seagal. **","1 out of 12 found this helpful.

Other than it's obvious poverty, not much is known about this country. Extraction has been one of the first appearances of Bangladesh in Hollywood. And it is a complete insult to Bangladeshi people. Bangladesh is not a great country. There is rampant poverty, large economic disparity, the issue of terrorism, and rise in illegal drugs and gambling. But in this movie, Bangladesh is portrayed as if it is Yemen or a generic African country. Dhaka city is shown as yellow, as if it has jaundice. Also the city is shown to be near a jungle. There are no jungles in near Dhaka or in the Dhaka district.The nearest jungles would be around Sylhet or Khulna. Land around Dhaka is mostly farmland. Also Dhaka is portrayed as lawless with the police and ""Elite""units under one drug lord. There is no such unit called an ""Elite"". The closest would be the Rapid Action Battalion (RAB). Portraying them as under the payroll of drug lords is insulting as they were the ones who have been carrying out a controversial crackdown against them and illegal gamblers recently. The movie also features children walking around with AK-47 SMGs in public, like as if Bangladesh is a war-torn African country. Bangladesh is one of those emerging economies, on par with Vietnam. Dhaka city may contain slums, but they do not make up the entire city. The movie also shows Hindi songs playing in every house. Bangladesh also has a music industry. Also, the local Bangla spoken is nothing like the one spoken in Bangladesh. It sounds more like a West Bengali accent like those spoken in Kolkata. They not only did not shoot the movie in Bangladesh, filming mostly in Ahmedabad in India with some scenes filmed in Thailand. There were also no Bangladeshi actors used with most of the locals being played by Indians such as Rudraksh Jaiswal. Also one the cast members is an Iranian named Golshifteh Farahani. Iranians are not the same as Bangladeshis. Also Iranians should stop playing Indians, Bangladeshis, and Arabs as a lot of them are willing to play negative stereotypes of Muslims and Arabs. Navid Negahan being one. The inaccuracies are as bad as those of Dan Brown novels such as Digital Fortress, which got Seville wrong, and Homeland, which gets things wrong about Beirut, Islamabad, and Islam. People try to justify these by using the ""it's fiction""excuse. Other than those inaccuracies, the movie also follows a white savior narrative. Our hero Tyler Rake is a typical white action hero. Although not an American, as Rake is made Australian to match his actor Chris Hemsworth, he has traits of a typical white American action hero. Just to save one child, he massacres many Bangladeshis. The movies plot is partly borrowed from the far superior Man on Fire, starring the Denzel Washington. The former atleast wasn't a modern ""Might Whitey"" story and had actual Mexican actors for a movie set in Mexico. People seem to really think this is best movie since John Wick. This movie has nothing in common with John Wick other than the brilliant fight scenes. It is more of a spiritual successor to Beirut (2018), due to its white savior narrative and inaccurate portrayal of a certain city in a developing country.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The culture and lifestyle are very different between Bangladesh and India. But the movie seemed like it was not only shot in India, but also about India. We don't have anything against our neighbor country - we are just surprised that if the name Dhaka is being used as the plot location, why not representing it properly?

It does not pass as a good story teller at all. The whole movie has barely any story. The screenplay is not written properly, nor it's execution is good or well done. Direction in respect to story telling is not up to the mark as it lacks the layers of a cinema that would unfold as it progresses.Coming to the point of characters, casting is very good, Indian actors like Randeep Hooda, Manoj Bajpai are really good actors, but they are being completely wasted as there's no space of character development or character progression. The whole film surrounds around Hemsworth, and I'll not say his performance is bad, but also not great.Action films of 90s have a similar pace and style.The only thing good about this movie is its execution of action sequences and its cinematography. The scenes are shot from great angle, and it's no surprise as the Ruso brothers are very fond of them. The movie has used a rusty color grading to portray Dhaka similiar to that used in breaking bad to portray Mexico.
For a industry like Hollywood it's very easy to decorate a movie with all this ornaments to make it look professional and eye catching, but at the end of the day it doesn't increases it's cinematic values.In summarisation I'll say this is not a good movie, the outcome of it is disappointing im respect for expectations.

We already know that Hargrave is very competent when it comes to action, escpecially close combat and hand-to-hand fights, and it shows. Chris Hemsworth is physically brilliant, thanks to his director, and gives us a glimpse at how John Wick might have moved 15 years ago. The camerawork is quite impressive, the look of the film is a bit generic, but still beautiful to behold.Unfortunately, that's where it ends. The characters are shallow, the story almost non-existant and the acting... well, how good can it be? Hemsworth and his fellow co-actors actually try to make the most of the weak material given to them, but that material is very low-mileage indeed. Astonishingly generic backstory for a potentially great protagonist, no background for the antagonist, no interesting side characters. Given that, any emotional impact is sorely missed, even if the film repeatedly tries to make you feel something with cheesy flashbacks, meaningless sad music and other cheap tricks.This is a film with a starved skeleton of a plot, uninteresting characters and no reveals or plot twists at all. No surprises, no emotions, no impact. And even with the action being absolutely top-notch, it doesn't spark any real interest, at least not from my side. I even found myself a bit bored after the umpteenth time of Hemsworth doing cool moves, which leads to the inevitable conclusion that even the action falls short of fulfilling its objective: to thrill and make you root for the hero. Still, my verdict would have been a 3/10 if it wasn't for the excellent action.And so a question pops up: should every stunt coordinator and second unit director get to become a director? If he can also tell a story and has a vision, sure! Unfortunately, Sam Hargrave doesn't seem to fit that description and might be better off sticking to his guns.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But let's just assume that it is a fictional Dhaka. Let's talk about the actual film.
The script is so poor, the movie was going to no where. Character development is so bad. We don't see anything that would help us to connect to the main character throughout the movie. The direction is soo bad (Except for the action scenes)
Director used the camera as mere capturing device. Even in an emotional scene, there was no camera work that would be visual storytelling.
Chris Hemsworth acting was so bad in this movie. He just had one or two expressions, and he carried them all along. No effort.
But kudos for the character played by Randeep Hooda. His character was better written than others and he acted so well. Way better than Chris.
There are people who are saying atleast the action is good. Yes, I agree. But movies are not only about action scenes. There's a reason why the universe of Cinema is so gigantic. You have no right to ridicule that grandness just by saying ""Atleast the action scenes are good""","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The whole country was eagerly waiting for the action-packed film since the Thor famed actor shared images from the shoot on the set of the film on his official Facebook page in November, 2018.The backdropAmerican action thriller Extraction, previously titled Dhaka, was greenlit back in 2017 by Netflix and is the directorial debut of famous Hollywood stunt coordinator Sam Hargrave. His titles include Hunger Games and several action films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The screenplay was written by Joe Russo, based on the comic book Cuidad by Ande Parks, Joe Russo, Anthony Russo, Fernando Leon Gonzalez, and Eric Skillman.The film is a co-production between Avengers: Infinity War (2018) directors Joe Russo and Anthony Russo's (commonly known as Russo brothers) independent production company AGBO and Netflix. The lead cast Hemsworth is also one of the producers in the project.The film was mainly shot in India's Ahmedabad and Mumbai in November 2018 and some shots were taken in Thailand and Dhaka, Bangladesh.The film's production began in Ahmedabad and Mumbai in November 2018.The plotTyler Rake, played by Chris Hemsworth, is a fearless black-market mercenary who is hired to rescue Ovi, played by Rudraksh Jaiswal, the kidnapped son of an imprisoned Indian crime lord. The kidnapping was done by a Dhaka based international drug lord which pushes Tyler into a deadly and almost impossible mission to Dhaka to save Ovi from the drug lord and his massive force of goons and bribed law enforcement members.The rightsExtraction takes its audience from Dhaka to Mumbai to Australia and back, giving us a picture of the interconnected drug traffic ring in South Asia. The two-hour-long film is dark and raw from start to end and every action film lover's dream.Not even a single action sequence of the film was ever exactly shot in Bangladesh except some plate shots for establishment, including the iconic action sequence at Sultana Kamal bridge near Demra.Chris Hemsworth never set foot in Dhaka yet the audience felt he was blazing his guns around Old Dhaka. All of the shots were taken in Ahmedabad and Mumbai.Hats off to the production design team behind the project who had done an excellent job of recreating Old Dhaka in Ahmedabad with such attention to details from the vehicles, to posters in streets, to every single sign board of each shop in each sequence.Russo brothers and Hargrave visited Dhaka couple of times but as Dhaka is not a very production friendly city, they just shot some establishment shots.As the director and producers of the project are the masterminds behind the Avengers franchise, not a single action sequence will let the audience down.
The long yet fast paced follow shots during the action sequences are a treat to experience.Hemsworth gave his absolute best playing the role of a hired black-market mercenary.The wrongsExcept for the smartly handled production design choices, action packed fight sequences, and Hemsworth's Asgardian god like charms nothing else really works in the movie. The screenplay is poorly written and lacks emotion. Though this is a spoiler free review yet there is really nothing more to the story line. The film feels like a two hour long fight sequence with some bandage breaks like a PUBG match on your phone.We see a Bangladeshi drug lord kidnap an Indian crime lord's son and Tyler is unleashed to extract him from Dhaka. But why the big names of the subcontinental criminal underworld came to this rivalry, why these desperate measures are unclear.Another problematic thing is the portrayal of Bangladesh's law enforcement agencies. Every agency including the police, a fictional force named ""Elite"" which looked like Bangladesh's Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), and even the Bangladeshi military were portrayed to the worldwide audience that they were controlled and bribed by Dhaka based international drug cartels which is fictional but still problematic.It paints a picture to the world that Dhaka is like Medellin in Colombia during the Pablo Escobar era which is far from true.The screenplay could have supported some residents or law enforcement officers who were not criminals or involved in drug rings to balance this but every scene of Dhaka felt very wrongly portrayed.Then comes the main issue of the whole film, the Indian actors who played Bangladeshi roles. Not a single one of them was talking Bangla in a ""Dhakaite"" accent or even a Bangladeshi one. Some Indian actors were completely butchering the language and most Dhaka based characters in the film sounded like they had a West Bengal based accent and pronunciation. Bangladeshi netizens were quick to respond to this error and complained that the producers of the film did not give attention to the language at all and how no one in Dhaka speaks like the way these characters in this film do.The creators of the project should have kept in mind that Bangla language is the quintessential element of Bengali identity and they are the only nation who had given their lives for their mother tongue. So a faulty dialect of this language will become a sensitive issue for the Netflix users of this country.Another huge issue was the acting of the kidnapped kid Ovi, played by Indian actor Rudraksh Jaiswal. As one of the lead characters of the film and having a huge screen time his acting weakness bores the viewers. Most of his dialogue deliveries are typical Bollywood melodrama and in some scenes beside Hemsworth he seems redundant and ridiculous.ConclusionThe Bangla language and Bangladeshi people, more accurately Dhaka's residents, were not accurately portrayed in Extraction. Yet it marks the beginning of an era where the stories of the capital of this small nation are being told by the Hollywood infrastructure to the whole world for the very first time on this scale. Events like these are important for Bangladesh and its filmmakers to create the urge in them to craft such stories on a massive scale for the global audience; stories which will be the accurate representations of the rich history, heritage and diversity of our beloved Dhaka.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Speciallythe viewers of subcontinent had a great expectation out of this movie. Everyone thought its gonna be action based well made movie, where things will be well presented. Makers could fill up the expectation of action but poorly made the set and environmen. People love to see the background especially when its about ur Countr. But here shooting were done in Ahmedabad and thailand but presenting Bangladesh. Eventhough this was ok. But the set didnt at all look loke Bangladesh and the local language used by local gangs was not the language of people of Banglades. This is very pathetic. Even the law in forcing team doesnt look at all like Bangladeshi. Dhaka doesnt have any forest beside river Buriganga. Its so funn. It just cant make a country so humiliating without any reason. Search team of this Movi, please wake up and do more research before depicting any country. Childern of Bangladesh doesnt carry AK 47. So, see this movie just for entertainment. Dont try to relate with actual scenario. Expected betrer.... Way better from Netflix.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Worst representation of Dhaka, Army, police, vehicles, environment & official bangla fonts on vehicles & arms forces are missing, people's clothing, houses, wrong bangla accent not even close but why? Everyone is listening Bollywood song for no reason where tons of popular bangla songs can be played instead. The movie completely missed the environment of Dhaka city. Maker tried to portray a more African-looking city with dirt roads and barely developed neighborhoods, while Dhaka city is a Metropolitan and quite well developed, they should have chosen some India's other continents or African countries would have been apt..... where you will have a drug hub, police underworld, children with gun.

Don't get me wrong i grew up with action movie, my father is a hardcore action movie, Stallone, Van damme, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Jackie chan is my childhood memories, because of that i put my standard to watch Extraction very low. The only reason i watch this movie just because Chris Hemsworth is my favourite Avenger.Suprisingly this movie have a good cinematography, the director of photography have a good job shoot the scene for hollywood quality thumbs up. The second good things in this film is the choreography of hand to hand combat, it's very good they do it perfectly, i love every hand to hand combat in this movie.Yup that's the good thingThe very first thing i catch bad in this movie is the CGI, okay it's not so bad but it's caught the attention of me, maybe because this movie have a very good cinematography that makes the little bad CGI caught the eye. Second bad thing is the plot is too simple, so many forgotten character and so many oversimplifying story plot. I won't SPOIL the story, i just make a simple note of example like:1.Why the kid care so much to the main character? (it's like just a one day movie set and why he trust the main character more than his father right hand?)2.What's the important subplot of gangster kid Dhaka?3.David Harbour character background is contradicting with his act motives4.The ending is just duh5.Is this father and son movie? (you'll see many father and son scene in many character plot)Yeah i would say they have a lazy writing here, but in the end credit i see that this movie is based on Graphic Novel called Ciudad. so i dont know if this movie stay loyal to the Graphic Novel source or not, if it's not then probably it's lazy writing.The conclusion is Extraction it's a movie that have a good cinematography and one of a kind hand to hand fight scene, but this movie is not a martial art movie like The Raid so probably you'll find more shooting than fist, you'll also find noticeable CGI, cheesy ending, unanswered background story, and many why plot.What concern my mind is why the choose grown up actor for Ovi The Extraction kid character? They have a gangster kid group in the Dhaka who is more younger than Ovi the Extraction Kid !maybe if they change the kid character to more younger actor maybe it'll make me more sympathy to the film, yes like Logan movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

A bit of Chris Hemsworth, though maybe still pretty average.Bad, quite a lot.1. Randeep Hooda, Pankaj Tripathi, great actors wasted.
2. Story line is completely not believable. Bangladesh is far from a yellow anarchic apocalypse zone with a failed state. Much white saviour stuff that was unnecessary in a mercenary story. Plot was nonsensical - for instance, why would an Indian mafia guy hire a non Bengali to infiltrate Bangladesh.
3. Much of the action was barely believable, and the climax didn't come together well enough to be believable.
4. Why was Bangladesh yellow?
5. Not too many great performances.Summary: Avoid, even if it's just on your Netflix subscription, there are too many good movies out there to waste your time with this.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

A handful lead actors can easily wreak havoc on an army trained professionals and literally send them to oblivion. But we are not talking about Avengers or Thor here.It becomes a problem when a production like this creates an allusion that the story setting and production design of the movie is 'the' true presentation of a real country, and it's capital, people and armed forces. Especially, if that country is the main setting of major Hollywood production for the first time ever.The production team might have taken some 'plateshots' of some filthy, dingy, overcrowded outskirts of the capital city of the story, which is fine, but that seemed to be the only thing to say about the city. The real nicer locations (not some artificial set) and millions of well educated middle class residents of the same city are totally missing. This is wrong, in my opinion.The law enforcement agencies as a whole have been portrayed as utterly corrupt and incompetent. Almost every single members of the force seemed to be chasing Chris Hemsworth and his band of hired guns like spellbound insects heading to light traps to meet their brutal ends. Explosions, gun fires, car crashes all happening nonstop in overcrowded and narrow suburban streets with complete disregard to many many innocent lives to save only the life of a kidnapped son of a drug lord. And this is somehow a redemption for the protagonist that audience should empathise with or even deem heroic!It is very unfortunate to see how a respectable movie personality like Chris Hemsworth may have tarnished the image of a country (he most likely has never visited) and its people in the name of fiction and entertainment.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Sure the action scenes are great but that's to be expected these days with film making tech and a bug budget.. The cast aren't great and the plot is predictable. The ending tried to be different but it just played out quiet silly. I'm sure it'll spawn a few sequels as there isn't much work needed to make these types of films. I'm sure alot of action fans will enjoy it and it's simplicity but for me, it lacked any standout performances or anything to think about or remember.. Its a one time movie, definitely not something I'd ever see myself watching again. Hats off to the stunt men tho, they carried the film and made the dull main cast look good.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The action choreography is top notch and the camera work in these sequences is great. But that's all. Other than that,it fails in every level.
The plot is thin and shallow with no engagement at all. The characters are weakly developed, so the emotional payoffs are flat . The good actors like Randeep Hooda and Pankaj Tripathi have been underutilized. Chris Hemsworth's performance is so so.
The warm color tone used is unique.Good action, good cinematography but bad plot, non engaging characters and very unbalanced screenplay. Not really recommended.

Unfortunately, they completely missed mark making the set in Dhaka.To start with, the accent of the locals are wrong, they are speaking in an accent that's commonly used in West Bengal, India. Dhaka and People in Bangladesh, in General, have a completely different accent. Throughout the movie, Hindi songs are heard in the background, where everyone is watching tv during midday. People go to work here, Dhaka is the capital, nobody sits on their asses watching TV midday. Bangladesh has its own music industry, although the movie had some issues acquiring copyright for some of the songs to play in the background.The environment is wrong. Sure Dhaka has slums and dirty places, but most of the city is developed enough with an actual nice road system. If they set the scene somewhere else in Bangladesh, it would've been more convincing. The roads are basically dirt roads in this movie where Dhaka has one of the best road systems in the Country. Dhaka doesn't have that kinda dense jungle anywhere near the city, certainly not near the Buriganga river.The criminal class in Bangladesh is completely different. This isn't Africa, people don't employ child soldiers here. And certainly carry Ak-47 in hand and in the open.The Police uniform and looks are completely misjudged. They are trying to portray the elite force of Bangladesh, Known as Rapid Action Battalion. They are not regular police. The deal with counter-terrorism and similar stuff. It should've been the police that deals with criminal or action in the street. Police vehicles are wrong.Don't get me wrong, the entire movie is brilliantly shot and exceptionally action-packed. But this provides a complete misrepresentation of Bangladesh, as well as the city of Dhaka. People who don't have an idea about Bangladesh will get a false sense for a beautiful country by the misrepresented set of this movie.

Unfortunately, they completely missed mark making the set in Dhaka.To start with, the accent of the locals are wrong, they are speaking in an accent that's commonly used in West Bengal, India. Dhaka and People in Bangladesh, in General, have a completely different accent. Throughout the movie, Hindi songs are heard in the background, where everyone is watching tv during midday. People go to work here, Dhaka is the capital, nobody sits on their asses watching TV midday. Bangladesh has its own music industry, although the movie had some issues acquiring copyright for some of the songs to play in the background.The environment is wrong. Sure Dhaka has slums and dirty places, but most of the city is developed enough with an actual nice road system. If they set the scene somewhere else in Bangladesh, it would've been more convincing. The roads are basically dirt roads in this movie where Dhaka has one of the best road systems in the Country. Dhaka doesn't have that kinda dense jungle anywhere near the city, certainly not near the Buriganga river.The criminal class in Bangladesh is completely different.This isn't Africa, people don't employ child soldiers here.And certainly carry Ak-47 in hand and in the open.The Police uniform and looks are completely misjudged.They are trying to portray the elite force of Bangladesh, Known as Rapid Action Battalion. They are not regular police. The deal with counter-terrorism and similar stuff.It should've been the police that deals with criminal or action in the street. Police vehicles are wrong.Don't get me wrong, the entire movie is brilliantly shot and exceptionally action-packed. But this provides a complete misrepresentation of Bangladesh, as well as the city of Dhaka. People who don't have an idea about Bangladesh will get a false sense for a beautiful country by the misrepresented set of this movie.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Be it any Latin American country, a country in the African continent and especially Middle Eastern countries.
It seems like they are finally starting to get India right, though Hollywood must think that all other countries around it must be the same. If Netflix went through such lengths to acknowledge a small country like Bangladesh and base the entire movie on it (which is a huge deal for countries which are not always known to the world), then why not get it right? The movie must have spent millions of dollars to produce such a massive action movie only to show a very expensive knock-off version of India. Chris Hemsworth has done an amazing job with his acting, and his action sequences were outstanding. But he could only cover so much of the incompetence of both the story and the setting.
Believe me, the natives who are complaining here are not because we feel that our country does not have any problems. It is because we do have a whole list of them, but none that were shown in this movie. For imagination I give this movie a higher score than I intended to.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Come on! First of all, the movie was not shot in Dhaka, Bangladesh. And then, a Bangladeshi army general obeying the command of a drug lord is something that never happened and will never happen. It's alright to show Chris killing a bunch of soldiers in the movie, but an army general in Bangladesh never obeys a drug lord since the army and the government is stable (not like what is portrayed in some Hollywood movies with plots in African countries). It was funny listening to the Indian actors talking in Bangla with Indian/Kolkatan accent. And old hindi songs playing in the alleys is what you'll see in India, not in Bangladesh. Dhaka is the center of the country with a large military base and the prime minister and all government officials residing there. So, Chris carrying out his mission in the center and the heart of the country is unimaginable. Also, crossing the bridge to hand over the kidnapped child seemed to be the main task at the end. It's hilarious that the army could only attack from one end of the bridge, and the other end is open in the center of the city. Stupid plot, but great action.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Brooding tough guy? Check. With a layer of scars and calluses from countless unnamed wars? Check. That are hiding a the soft centre of a genuinely good man? Also check. Right, let's have a quick flashback to hint at his tragic backstory and explain why he's so broken and self destructive. Done. And give him one last mission - a rescue, someone vulnerable that reminds him of his tragic loss. The list of action tropes goes on and on - right down to the pretty lady, the hint of new beginnings, of a relationship that can happen once the hero's dealt with his demons. *slaps forehead and sighs* There's just no reason for this thing to exist - other than to prove Hemsworth can do more than Thor. Which he probably can, but this does little for his case. The plot is purille; Rescue drug dealer's kid, oh no, we've been double-crossed (imagine that) but we'll carry on despite the fact he's nothing to us because it's the right thing to do. Even if that means killing hundreds of police with families who are just doing their jobs, a whole lot of innocent bystanders, truck loads of bad guys and a few highly trained professional mercenaries. This makes not a lick of sense considering at one point the mercenaries actually say they couldn't keep the kid safe even if they could pull off the rescue. This is glossed over at the end. The characters are flat and predictable. We know the bad guys are bad because, like Bond villains, they just stand around throwing kids off buildings and doing evil stuff. A lot has been said about the action but really, it's just OK. It's mostly down to shaky camera work making everything seem faster and more frenetic. The location is the film's one interesting point. And also the source of some of the problems with the action. There's a few chase scenes that anyone who's tried to drive in India would know are impossible. Pedestrians etc jump out of the way like in a bad computer game. And in one scene a speeding vehicle comes out of absolutely nowhere to hit poor Chris. Despite the fact we've just see that all the narrow streets are blocked. Inconvenient. But don't worry, we'll just take this truck that's conveniently appeared - from the same narrow alleyways that we've just seen to be jam-packed with people and overturned stalls and carts and whatnot. And drive off at speed. The simplistic plot goes from dumb to dumber as we head towards the inevitable showdown on the bridge we caught a glimpse of at the beginning. It's the typical 'we have to get from A to B' scenario via the hardest way possible ignoring any possible alternatives. ""The police have all the bridges blocked? And for some obscure reason you can't get a chopper to us until we get to the other side?! Umm, what about a boat?"" ""Shhhh. You're spoiling it."" This is anachronistic, dated, dumb action that simply shouldn't be. After watching 6 Underground which felt fresh and interesting (for a popcorn action movie), you have to wonder why Netflix greenlit such a backward leap for the genre.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It stars Chris Hemsworth who plays Thorin the Marvel Universe, Golshifteh Farahani from Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, Sam Hargrave, and Rudhraksh Jaiswa.Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), a mercenary, gets hired to keep Ovi Mahajan Jr. (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) safe from the rival crime families who are trying to kidnap him. Ovi is the son of a powerful crime lord.I thought I would like this movie, due to the fact Joe Russo wrote the script and it stars Chris Hemsworth. However, even though Extraction has action, I found it; confusing, slow at times, and not very interesting.The action was more towards the end instead of all throughout the movie. There were lots of car chases, gun fights, and even ran into cars without getting hurt, similar to how John Wick never got hurt. I think it's impressive that Hemsworth did most of his own stunts.While Rake is trying to protect Ovi, they get betrayed by people they thought they could trust. It reminded me of how confusing the 1996 Mission Impossible film was where his team betrayed Ethan. I found it hard to figure out who the good and bad guys were in both movies.The only two characters I found myself caring about were Rake and Ovi. Hemsworth did a good job portraying a mercenary who at first was only protecting the kid for the money, but they eventually develop a relationship.For an action movie, the action didn't start right away. I was expecting a John Wick style movie, with lots of action from beginning to end.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Other than that the film is full of bad choices. First is the language, if you want to make a film a a countries background you can't show all the native people talking in some other accent. Here in this film all the supposed Dhaka residents always talking in an accent that is of West Bengal, India, not anywhere near Dhaka. Then the roads, houses and songs! yes you heard right, songs. Roads are dhaka are not like shown in the film, dart roads, so when you watch the film you will feel this is not dhaka at all. The houses are not like dhaka. In the film you can hear hindi film songs from 90's in almost every house. Sadly the film is not set in 90's background but today. And in Dhaka you will not hear 90's hindi song in souses or cafes. So altogether this film does not give a single bit of felling that it's in Dhaka, then why using the name anyway? I understand that being a fantasy film this does not require to be accurate but you can't get all wrong. I feel like the director never did much study on Dhaka before making this movie, otherwise why a Director debut with a film which can be called, ""The Action of Errors""But having said that, If you love solid breathtaking nonstop action and Chris Hemsworth then this movie is enjoyable none the less. After all, how many of us remember a city from a movie after several months?","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

As Covid-19 lockdown continues in Bangladesh, every film lovers' eyes were on Netflix this Friday as they dropped their latest original film Extraction starring Hollywood superstar Chris Hemsworth. The whole country was eagerly waiting for the action-packed film since the Thor famed actor shared images from the shoot on the set of the film on his official Facebook page in November, 2018.The backdropAmerican action thriller Extraction, previously titled Dhaka, was greenlit back in 2017 by Netflix and is the directorial debut of famous Hollywood stunt coordinator Sam Hargrave. His titles include Hunger Games and several action films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The screenplay was written by Joe Russo, based on the comic book Cuidad by Ande Parks, Joe Russo, Anthony Russo, Fernando Leon Gonzalez, and Eric Skillman.The film is a co-production between Avengers: Infinity War (2018) directors Joe Russo and Anthony Russo's (commonly known as Russo brothers) independent production company AGBO and Netflix. The lead cast Hemsworth is also one of the producers in the project.The film was mainly shot in India's Ahmedabad and Mumbai in November 2018 and some shots were taken in Thailand and Dhaka, Bangladesh.The film's production began in Ahmedabad and Mumbai in November 2018.The plotTyler Rake, played by Chris Hemsworth, is a fearless black-market mercenary who is hired to rescue Ovi, played by Rudraksh Jaiswal, the kidnapped son of an imprisoned Indian crime lord. The kidnapping was done by a Dhaka based international drug lord which pushes Tyler into a deadly and almost impossible mission to Dhaka to save Ovi from the drug lord and his massive force of goons and bribed law enforcement members.The rightsExtraction takes its audience from Dhaka to Mumbai to Australia and back, giving us a picture of the interconnected drug traffic ring in South Asia. The two-hour-long film is dark and raw from start to end and every action film lover's dream.Not even a single action sequence of the film was ever exactly shot in Bangladesh except some plate shots for establishment, including the iconic action sequence at Sultana Kamal bridge near Demra.Chris Hemsworth never set foot in Dhaka yet the audience felt he was blazing his guns around Old Dhaka. All of the shots were taken in Ahmedabad and Mumbai.Hats off to the production design team behind the project who had done an excellent job of recreating Old Dhaka in Ahmedabad with such attention to details from the vehicles, to posters in streets, to every single sign board of each shop in each sequence.Russo brothers and Hargrave visited Dhaka couple of times but as Dhaka is not a very production friendly city, they just shot some establishment shots.As the director and producers of the project are the masterminds behind the Avengers franchise, not a single action sequence will let the audience down.
The long yet fast paced follow shots during the action sequences are a treat to experience.Hemsworth gave his absolute best playing the role of a hired black-market mercenary.The wrongsExcept for the smartly handled production design choices, action packed fight sequences, and Hemsworth's Asgardian god like charms nothing else really works in the movie. The screenplay is poorly written and lacks emotion. Though this is a spoiler free review yet there is really nothing more to the story line. The film feels like a two hour long fight sequence with some bandage breaks like a PUBG match on your phone.We see a Bangladeshi drug lord kidnap an Indian crime lord's son and Tyler is unleashed to extract him from Dhaka. But why the big names of the subcontinental criminal underworld came to this rivalry, why these desperate measures are unclear.Another problematic thing is the portrayal of Bangladesh's law enforcement agencies. Every agency including the police, a fictional force named ""Elite"" which looked like Bangladesh's Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), and even the Bangladeshi military were portrayed to the worldwide audience that they were controlled and bribed by Dhaka based international drug cartels which is fictional but still problematic.It paints a picture to the world that Dhaka is like Medellin in Colombia during the Pablo Escobar era which is far from true.The screenplay could have supported some residents or law enforcement officers who were not criminals or involved in drug rings to balance this but every scene of Dhaka felt very wrongly portrayed.Then comes the main issue of the whole film, the Indian actors who played Bangladeshi roles. Not a single one of them was talking Bangla in a ""Dhakaite"" accent or even a Bangladeshi one. Some Indian actors were completely butchering the language and most Dhaka based characters in the film sounded like they had a West Bengal based accent and pronunciation. Bangladeshi netizens were quick to respond to this error and complained that the producers of the film did not give attention to the language at all and how no one in Dhaka speaks like the way these characters in this film do.The creators of the project should have kept in mind that Bangla language is the quintessential element of Bengali identity and they are the only nation who had given their lives for their mother tongue. So a faulty dialect of this language will become a sensitive issue for the Netflix users of this country.Another huge issue was the acting of the kidnapped kid Ovi, played by Indian actor Rudraksh Jaiswal. As one of the lead characters of the film and having a huge screen time his acting weakness bores the viewers. Most of his dialogue deliveries are typical Bollywood melodrama and in some scenes beside Hemsworth he seems redundant and ridiculous.ConclusionThe Bangla language and Bangladeshi people, more accurately Dhaka's residents, were not accurately portrayed in Extraction. Yet it marks the beginning of an era where the stories of the capital of this small nation are being told by the Hollywood infrastructure to the whole world for the very first time on this scale. Events like these are important for Bangladesh and its filmmakers to create the urge in them to craft such stories on a massive scale for the global audience; stories which will be the accurate representations of the rich history, heritage and diversity of our beloved Dhaka.

-Wrong Insignia in law enforcement uniform
-Wrong portrayal of Dhaka city streets
-Wrong portrayal of Bangladeshi characters ( We are not having a famine)
-Desperate attempts to make Dhaka look like Kabul / Mogadishu
-Completely ignoring Urban & actual Dhaka
-People listening to Hindi songs during noon & sitting duck
( Understandable since the filming took place in Ahmedabad and not actual Dhaka)
-Open food and fish market in the middle of the street; blocking everything
-Desperate attempts to make the streets look like post world war BerlinThings I'm not okay with:-No, kids are not carrying AK47 here for any reasons.
-In the history of Bangladesh we have never had such a drug lord or companion
-Not showing anything from actual Dhaka was the biggest mistake, urban Dhaka is nice, structured & progressive, not anything like what was shown in the movie.
-Employing no adviser from Bangladesh's actual law enforcement agencies or military
-Potentially impacting a bad effect on Bangladesh's tourism industry as many in the west will actually believe this fictional Dhaka.
-No, this ain't 1980's ColumbiaOverall, the movie is somewhat enjoyable. Everything about the movie felt so common with Sicario!

If you go to the bathroom or in the kitchen for 15mins and you come back, you haven't missed anything, the plot is so poor and the whole thing so predictable.
Come on Netflix, dont just make movies by the kilo, invest in a new idea

It also doesn't help that his stunt coordinator for his Marvel films directed this movie. Extraction yells mediocrity from beginning to end.Chris Hemsworth is called to rescue the son of a Hindu drug lord in Dhaka. The plot is simple enough, but OOPS, it lacks foresight, character development, and anything resembling logic. It's obvious Russo wrote this script while his mind was on Avengers, because the story is so surface level and dull that nothing feels salvageable. This is because the film moves so quickly to get to Dhaka and the action scenes that there's no time to develop character.Chris Hemsworth plays a mercenary who's ONLY character trait is that he misses his dead son. THAT'S IT! Beyond that, he's just a soulless automaton. The man who kidnaps the boy has no character outside of ""I'm the villain, therefore I kidnap kids and kill them"" and THAT'S IT. The boy, named Ovi, has no trait other than ""My father treats me like a thing"" and THAT'S IT. All the main characters have little to no character so I couldn't care about them. The secondary characters have more going for them!The filmmaking and editing are by-the-books bland. Other than the typical shaky cam and odd angled action shots, there's a random LONG take shot that comes outta nowhere and just took me out of the movie. It's so out of place from the rest of the movie-plus it totally doesn't help the action scenes one bit-that I felt the director ONLY did it because he wanted to show off and be like ""HEY, I CAN SHOOT A LONG SHOT ACTION TAKE TOO!"" I hate using this word-because it's often overused and misused-but it came off as utterly pretentious and unnecessary.Extraction is ONLY getting praise for the action scenes, which I find to be very disconcerting. Like I said, the action scenes aren't anything special. I've heard some people call it the John Wick of mercenary films?? ehhhhh, no. John Wick at least has character and is campy enough to have fun watching. This film is just a mediocre, poorly thought out, sad waste of time and Chris Hemsworth. If you want to watch a really good mercenary type film on Netflix-in the same vein of Extraction-watch Triple Frontier.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Netflix I think is producing low budget movies to create more and more of content without caring much about quality.
They are just spending their budget mainly on one superstar to market and give their content a push and all other aspects of film are sidelined.

The massive Chris Hemsworth plays some sort of special forces gun-for-hire type who is tasked with rescuing (i.e. ""extracting"") the son of a Bangladeshi drug lord who was kidnapped by a rival drug lord. This is the setup for action-set-piece after action-set-piece. The action is solid and above average, and I most appreciate that the action is more street-level of action that's grounded in reality, along the lines of WICK or HEAT as opposed to Michael Bay-style (BAD BOYS, TRANSFORMERS, etc.) of bombastic nonsense. Stuntman-turned-director Sam Hargrave (he was Captain America's stunt double) keeps the action closer to reality with long continuous shots, with sneaky cuts here and there, but the absence of excessive fast cutting is a welcome change of pace. Still, EXTRACTION is nowhere as good as WICK or HEAT and the film also has some problematic elements with a giant white savior blowing away a bunch of brown people in a developing country, including smacking around some child soldiers. Still, it kept my interest while I was exercising on my elliptical.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie feels like a video game where the viewer is taken through one action-packed scene to the next all while the human element of the characters is left woefully unexplored.The art of action movie making seems to have shifted more to elaborate stunt and special effect extravaganza, while ignoring the more intimate and quite moments needed for the characters to become likeable enough for you to care for them. Comparing modern action movies to the offerings from the 70-90's era, it becomes all too evident to me that this genre has seen a noticeable decline in quality over the years and extraction is a painful reminder of this.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Chris Hemsworth kicks add in a really dumb,forgettable action movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5680359/?ref_=tt_urv","MovieWarfare","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112855274/?ref_=tt_urv","26 April 2020","What interested me in watching this film was seeing Chris Hemsworth in a movie outside of Marvel and the fact that this film was produced by the Russo brothers who did amazing Marvel movies. However, this movie was a Netflix exclusive movie which is rarely a hit. The basic premise of the movie is Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) has got to extract the child of a drug lord in India who was kidnapped by the drug lord of Bangladesh for money. Simple.Starting with the positive and probably the biggest reason why anyone wants to watch this movie, the action. This movie goes for a John Wick style of action with its incredible choreography and fast pace action. The action scenes are extremely violent and brutal which is borderline gratuitous but so entertaining. There is one particular action scene which is filmed to make it seem like an 11 minute one camera shot scene and it is really good even if the cuts are obvious. Praise should also be given to Chris Hemsworth's performance who gives a lot of likability and charisma for his character. Additionally, it is clear that Chris did a lot of the stunt for this movie and the director utilized this properly and effectively. The soundtrack and cinematography are also pretty good especially considering the scenery and high octane action.This is where the praise ends. How was this a screenplay/story from the Russo brothers? It's very barebone and has a lot of forgettable dialogue. There is a plan from one of the drug lord that just feels really dumb and done so we can have a cool fight. Additionally, there are non-action moments in the movie where it just feels like time panning and slowing down the momentum. These moments would be fine if it felt like it was adding something but these moments are a bore with mediocre dialogue and boring characters that it is uninteresting. The movie is also very predictable and this is due to the fact that this movie adopts way too many cliches from older action movies but just giving a fresh coat of paint. These moments made me just wish they would just get to the next action set piece already. On that note of characters, they give some backstory for Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) and the ex-military man who was hunting him to make him sympathetic but that's it. It would be nice to have been shown and not just told stuff about him because it just feels like a throwable line just to quickly give Tyler some characterization. What about his relationship with the mercenary girl or even David Harbour. Speaking of David Harbour even though he is a great actor, his character is incredibly forgettable. Every supporting character is forgettable to the point that I don't really know anything about them. The kid that Tyler saves likes playing the piano and is a son of a drug lord but apart from that, we know nothing about him. I would love to know more about his character by exploring his relationship a bit more with his father and ex-military dude or even how life is like as a son of a murderous drug lord. Furthermore, the relationship between Tyler and the kid just feels incredibly rushed and unearned. They just suddenly have huge trust in each other without any conflict which just feels unnatural. A lot of critics have bashed its aimless violence but it doesn't really bother me but I do feel that it doesn't feel necessary a lot of the times. However, the last act of this movie gets really tedious by giving hoards of mindless goons for Tyler to kill that just kind of makes you feel numb and bored of it.If all you want from a movie is Chris Hemsworth kicking ass then this movie is really good. The director was definitely a stunt man as this movie has great stunts which shows the experience of a veteran stunts person. However, these action scenes don't really do something drastically new so don't expect anything revolutionary either. The action is all this movie got going for it. If you expect a good story or good characters similar to John Wick then this movie does not have that going for it sadly.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Chris Hemsworth and Randip Hooda did great,
I always love Their work, because they are dedicated actor. They try to live up to the mark, there is no such residence like Amir asif lives in can ever found in Dhaka, Dhaka do not have forest body/ JUNGLE.. The movie could have more relatable if it was based on Sundaban side, And we have our own music, we Do not listen to Hindi songs every minute.
Now if i come to the plot There was no such plot, the Bangladeshi Drug lord Pablo Escobar as they mentioned he does not know how to speak in bangla and that was the first Disaster about the film that is noticeable. There is no such force that is Called ''Elite'' in our country..
It was such a disgrace and downgrade to our Country in many aspect, however if you like an action-packed movie and you dont care about the plot then yeah! You may go for it, You'll be surprised by the action choreograph...

And what's worse, they try and make it into somekind of emotional journey... Such a disappointment, really actors like chris helmsworth? need to stop chasing the netflix paycheck and be more picky about the types of movies they accept. For sure netflix might pay well just now, but if he makes another one of these turkeys he'll soon find himself stuck in b-movie limbo.
Di caprio is the only actor I can think of who isn't chasing netflix cash and is protecting his name...

Ovi Sr. Orders Saju Rav to retrieve his son, or he will have his son killed.Mercanary Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth) is hired for the rescue mission. Already here I was a bit confused. If Saju was ordered to retrieve Mahajan's son, who recruited Tyler, and why? Because, as it turns out, Saju and Tyler try killing each other with every opportunity they get. How did Tyler and his team - lead by Tyler's partner Nik Khan - hear about the kidnapping, and how did they get involved in the rescue? Maybe I missed something, as I didn't fully understood this premise.Finding and retrieving the kid was the easy part for fearless tough guy Tyler. However, getting him out of the city was an entirely different matter altogether. When Amir discovered the kid had been retrieved, he ordered the Head of Police to close all the city's exits. Amir is a powerful, wealthy and ruthless antagonist.The action sequences and fight choreography are impressive, to say the least. The action is fast and relentless, and incredibly well done. Chris Hemsworth delivers, and I enjoyed the fact his character also had an emotional side, showcasing Hemsworth's acting abilities. I also liked the way Tyler and Ovi bonded.Unfortunately, there was so much about this movie I didn't enjoy. Ever since John Wick raised the body count in action movies, it seems the higher the body count, the better. I disagree. (By the way, I absolutely HATE the John Wick movies). There is A LOT of killing and destruction for just one kid. And I didn't even fully understand why the kid was so important in the movie, because there was nothing special about him. He was simply the child of a drug lord and not much thought went into Ovi as a standalone character.I also didn't like the way Tyler was killing police officials left, right and center. The film automatically assumes the viewer will see the police as the enemy because they are in pursuit of the film's protagonist, but keep in mind they are simply police officers doing their job. Why do they deserve to die so violently? Why doesn't Tyler have ANY consideration for these officers? Had they been Amir's henchmen, it would have been a different story. But these are innocent men! The more (innocent) people Tyler killed, the less I liked the movie - and Tyler. The killing became mindless - just like the John Wick movies. The body count easily exceeds one hundred. Hopefully this is not the future of action movies.While I absolutely loved the action sequences and stunt work, all the unnecessary killings ruined the movie for me.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Come on, Bangladesh is not Syria or Afghanistan. Disappointing.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

Instead it makes a mistake, it takes itself too seriously with dramatic segments that should add some emotion apart from the entertainment but on the contrary they only break the rhythm and feel unconvincing and inevitably forced.
For other movies it could have worked but in this one, with its two-line script, there wasn't any space for that.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","EXTRACTION: ""WHITE MEN SAVING BROWN CHILDREN FROM BROWN MEN","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7670953/?ref_=tt_urv","fatimalakhani-02136","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147449438/?ref_=tt_urv","22 December 2021","Extraction is based on a graphic novel that is written by Joe Russo and co-produced with his brother Anthony. ""Extraction"" is the first sibling duo's movie released since the historic success of ""Avengers: Endgame. Extraction is directed by Sam Hargraves, who makes his directorial debut in several short films such as The Shoot, Game Changer, and Reign.If you want to watch a movie with an interesting story this isn't the one but if you're just looking for some action then Extraction is worth a watch. The story is pretty basic, with some machos shooting around. It is bombarded with action scenes. It's mostly about Chris Harmsworth that fits perfectly as the untouchable hero macho warrior. Extraction is a triumph of pure kinetic energy with a cast that did a pretty good job, with some amazing choreographed action scenes, and some quality cinematography.The story is set into motion when the young son Ovi (Rudhraksh Jaiswal) of India's biggest drug lord is kidnapped and held hostage by his main rival in Dhaka, Bangladesh. Ovi lives privileged life, but is lonely within his surroundings. His father is Mahajan (Pankaj Tripathi), a ruthless drug lord in India who's currently residing in prison for his crimes, leaving parental overseeing to Saju (Randeep Hooda), his right-hand man, who has a family of his own to care for. One night, while spending time at club with some friends, Ovi is kidnapped by men who work for Amir Asif (Priyanshu Painyuli), a major drug lord from Bangladesh, who's looking to take advantage of Mahajan's imprisonment, with plans to conquer his rival's territory by holding his son as a hostage.To rescue the child from one of the world's most impenetrable cities, they hire the services of a black market mercenary- Tyler Rake (Chris Hemsworth), who already harbors a death wish and has got nothing left to lose. But is pulled into duty by a team, led by Niki Khan (Goldshifteh Farahani). As the operation gets underway, further complications arise when the crime lord's chief henchman acts on his own accords to bring the boy back, thus making things worse for everyone. As the entire city goes on immediate lockdown, the deadly mission becomes nearly impossible. But hired merc plans to navigate through the hostile city to see his mission to the end and saving Ovi from anyone who gets in his way.Overall the film's location, production designs and action choreography were spot on-it looks terrific .Portraying an urban Indian cityscape that feels claustrophobic and maze-like design helps build tension in the feature's story. And most importantly, the film's soundtrack and few softer melodies -composed by Alex Belcher and Henry Jackman, were perfectly synced with the intense fighting and dialogue scenes respectively.But that is not enough to make a good action movie. We needed to see a back story or something from Tyler instead of glimpses of his son with that it would have been better because of that attachment. Also, the biggest thing that annoyed me with the film was the beginning scene. Where we see the ending fight sequence at the beginning then it cuts back in time. The acting overall I thought was well done, it would be cool to see Golshifteh Farahani, Randeep Hooda, and Rudhrasksh Jaiswal in more American movies. Overall the action and acting were great but the story and characters could have used a little more work.For the movie's cast,Hemsworth was perfect as Tyler Rake -the leading man. In more secondary characters roles, actor Randeep Hooda does a good job in the role of Saju.the character of Saju is more of a ""physical"" role, which means that there isn't much depth provide for Hooda to play around with. Thus, the actor makes the role memorable by ways and means of how he interacts with situations (much like Hemsworth) and provides a solid action character that is trying to do what is necessary to protect his family. Likewise, young actor Rudhraksh Jaiswal as Ovi Mahajan Jr. Was effectively good in the role. In this movie, Jaiswal still pulls off a convincing (and likeable) performance in the role. Plus, his interaction with both Hemsworth and Hooda are equally good throughout. Behind them, actress Goldshifteh Farahani as niki khan (head of merencey team) and actor David Harbour as Gaspar (a special operative in Dhaka are respectfully good in their supporting character roles of lending a hand to Rake.Personally, I liked this movie. Yes, there were a few parts that could've been easily expanded and I felt that some of the unsaid story elements were distracting, but I felt the Hargrave's movie is definitely worth a watch. Thus, my recommendation for this film is a favorable ""recommended"" one, especially to fans of the action movie genre as well as fans of Hemsworth's work.Extraction is 116 minutes long and is rated R for strong bloody violence, language, and brief drug usage throughout the movie.Rating: 4/5.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The director is a stuntman and it shows. He knew how to push the actors to the max for those fight scenes! Unfortunately, the story felt like a rip off from Denzel Washingtons ""Man on fire"" in many aspects. In total it is a super un-original and bland story.Filled with cliches, for example pretty woman having almost no role other then looking pretty. The violence was senseless. all act of violence are senseless of course but in this case much more so. I can't say much without spoilers but the story had zero depth. The director clearly just wanted to make his debute as action director and work with Hemsworth and had zero care for the story to be good.I wanna give the fight scenes an 8.

But if you're an action movie fan having a knack for violence and gore, you don't want to miss this one.With little to no plot, the movie starts off with a quick introduction of the characters and dives into non-stop action with single-shot car chases, hand-to-hand combats, knives, guns and explosions. Chris Hemsworth plays a likable character, a tough ex-army and a mercenary on the outside and a depressive, suicidal alcoholic waiting to get off of his misery. The kid on the other hand is decent and sympathetic, they gelled together. Another interesting character to look out for is Saju played by Randeep, he is calm and poise in the beginning and would go to extremes to save his family. You feel for him and at times it's difficult to take sides between charactersThe impressive part of the movie is the location and imagery with dusty brown pallet backed with intense action sequences and the cultural diversity. Beautiful colors, ruthless drug mafia, Hindi rap songs and Dhaka families watching Bollywood movies amidst chaos.I think people shouldn't get so bent out of shape regarding the portrayal of the country and people in it. It's just a movie the same negativity arose when Slumdog Millionaire released, people were so upset regarding the portrayal of country and slums but it's just a movie and there's a lot to take from it to enjoy and get entertained.It's fun to watch and relax on a Friday evening, nothing much.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
