Approaching nearly 22 years old, the original film still holds up as, not only a great film, but a thought provoking one too. Fast forward to 2017, we're introduced to the CGI spectacle that many believed was going to be the first great live action adaptation especially when the first trailer was released. Instead of appeasing fans of the original, this film decides to clip its own nuts and wants to be seen on a broader spectrum. Throw in some heavily edited fight sequences, a PG-13 rating and Scarlett Johansson, we get 2017 Ghost in the Shell...and it is downright painful at times.The film is, more or less, a shot for shot remake at times and then other times it tries to do its own thing. Truthfully, Rupert Sanders' erratic direction and Jamie Moss' lackluster adapted script make this a very hard film for a fan to watch. While it may be easily looked over because of the wonderful use of CGI and cinematography, under the surface the film is superficial and very idiotic at times. Scarlett Johansson as Major is a major miscast (no pun intended). She is wooden and feels like she is sleepwalking through this role. While it is clear that after Lucy and The Avengers, Johansson is wanting to be an action hero icon. She is a tremendous actress in every way but it is hard to buy her as Major. Overall, this film is yet another remake that misses the mark. Walking out of my screening, I kept hearing the comparisons to the remake of RoboCop from a group of people. I must say, this was an accurate comparison and I couldn't have made a better comparison even if I tried. The film suffers from blatant studio meddling, a poor script, and a very erratic director, much like that remake. These are three things that are too hard to ignore. Hardcore fans of Ghost in the Shell will probably be massively disappointed by this blatant cash grab. The young teenagers might get a kick out of the action sequences and CGI but the adults will be left watching the original for their enjoyment.","120 out of 256 found this helpful.

Maybe it's because I have a huge crush on Scarlett Johansson, but let's hope not. I thought everything, from the acting to the cinematography to the action, was amazing. It's definitely one of my favorites for 2017 so far. I watched this without watching the original. I was going to at first, but gave up believing that I'll have expectations that are too high or get brainwashed somehow. I didn't want to review this movie as a live- action remake, but just a movie. I wish I could go into more detail, but I have nothing more to say. I don't know if I recommend this movie or not in general, but give it a try if you like cyberpunk action movies or a fan of the original anime. Or just if you like Scarlett Johansson.","127 out of 140 found this helpful.

Scarlett Johansson's portrayal of Major was captivating, embodying the essence of a cybernetic being grappling with identity. The film editing embraced the high-tech aesthetic, seamlessly blending action sequences with moments of introspection. The movie's strength lies in its visual spectacle, transporting the audience to a dystopian world that feels both futuristic and eerily familiar. While the narrative occasionally stumbled in fully exploring its existential themes, the music added a haunting layer that complemented the film's atmosphere. Cinematography plunged us into a neon-soaked cityscape, capturing the beauty and complexity of a world where humanity and technology intertwine. At 7/10, Ghost in the Shell is a cyberpunk visual feast that sparks contemplation on what it means to be human in an increasingly digital age.","6 out of 7 found this helpful.

I was slightly surprised in what glory it fails.Pretty much everything semi-important of this movie works amazingly well. The visuals are fantastic, the effects are great, the atmosphere is beautiful and the music is very good. But in the central points of what made the original hauntingly beautiful, this one lacks: Instead of a delicate view at what it means to be human, this movie rather goes for a weak action plot. The screenplay does a mediocre Matrix impression. The dialogues are just blunt and miss the grace and sensibility of its 20 year old reference. I stopped caring after 30 minutes.As such the action scenes don't carry any weight and all the citations from the original anime come across as hollow and weightless. Which is a shame, as they are executed great! What a waste. I really wanted to like this movie, but it hardly anything but another well made yet ultimately boring action flick.","40 out of 78 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Surprisingly good (but streamlined)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4048008/?ref_=tt_urv","Exit_Music","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2996332/?ref_=tt_urv","30 January 2018","Before I get into this review, let me start off by saying that I'm very familiar with the original Ghost in the Shell. Overall, the original was an excellent movie. Moving on, I'm pleasantly surprised how good Ghost in the Shell 2017 is. Within the first 5 minutes, I was immersed in the film's atmosphere. It seemed as if the music and sound, the camera angles, the lighting and effects, the acting, etc, all served a purpose for the greater good of the movie. Never once did I get the feeling that the special effects were there to just be eye candy. All the elements of production seemed to synergize off of each other. It seemed that every singe ounce and aspect of production effects were used to their full potential. The film looked gorgeous, and sounded awesome. Every scene had a sense of wonder to it as there was always something to visually admire. Wardrobe was amazing as well. The acting was ok, but I'm a little biased since I'm not too fond of Scarlet J.Beat Takishi was phenomenal (as always). The actor who stood out the most was Pilou Asbæk as Batou. His performance, body language, and overall presence was great to watch. The only reservation I had about the film was the story line. The only comparison I will make to the original is that this 2017 counterpart is more streamlined compared to the nihilistic tone of the original. I'm not necessarily saying this is a bad thing, it's just different. This definitely had a more mainstream appeal to it. Again, not bad, just different. The action scenes were breathtaking and exciting. The few times I've felt this type of excitement towards action scenes were 1) The first time I saw the trailer for The 5th Element and 2) The first time I saw the trailer for The Matrix. Overall, I have nothing but good things to say about Ghost in the Shell (2017). It's a pure sci-fi movie down to its core. While it doesn't alienate most of its viewers, it doesn't spoon feed plot, character motivation, or dialogue. In my completely subjective opinion, it is a visual appealing, streamlined masterpiece of the original.","97 out of 106 found this helpful.

I got it from the local library today along with three others. I watched it first as I thought it would be rubbish; it wasn't. Not sure why all the bad reviews. I thought it was a good story and was well done. I knew nothing about the subject before I watched the movie so it was all new to me. I liked the way the main character developed (a bit like Robocop) and thought the supporting cast good. Do not get me wrong: the film is not great, but I was entertained and did not have to fast forward at all (always a bad sign) and I rewound quite a few bits to watch again (always a good sign). It's fantasy of course and definitely silly in parts. The CGI is poor in parts too. However, overall I liked it and would definitely watch it again.","11 out of 15 found this helpful.

Next, the guy who played Batou did a better job.In some aspects, a decent live-action re-enactment of all the iconic scenes from the 90s anime. The effects guys, the camera and lights guys, set creators, make-up artists, costume makers and this Sanders fellow got the looks, feel and mood of the original GITS environments of the manga and anime series absolutely spot on. It's eye candy for fans who've wondered how GITS can be visually represented in a live-action film. That's all there is to have; everything else is just utter rubbish.This film is not worthy of the title, Ghost in the Shell, because apart from the visuals, there is no semblance of it to the source material that one can consider it generous to call this ""a generic cyborg action film inspired by GITS"". If we are to just listen to the dialogue, and all the character names are changed and Section 9 is called something else, we wouldn't have a clue that this film is adapted from GITS. The essence that makes GITS what it is in all its different incarnations (various manga and anime) is missing and we are left with bits of shallow musings about what it means to be human in a robotic body.So all in, if you're unfamiliar with the source material, it'll be a mildly interesting plod through a pretty but rather boringly paced sci-fi. Fans of GITS would probably wonder why bother to make a live-action adaptation if you're not going to put the spirit of the source material into the movie.","187 out of 433 found this helpful.

However, IT'S AWESOME! I watched it on IMAX and I was amazed with what I saw, it's just gorgeous.The film pays a tribute the the original GITS and brings new things to the table. Scarlett and Pilou are great... Even the way Major walks is identical, everything is great. I can't talk bad about this one cause there's no reason for it.The only thing I didn't like was one or two dialog scenes where they dumb it down a little. I don't understand who are these super extremely smart people that decide that viewers are dumb. Apart from that....I think it was great, I highly recommend IMAX for this one (this coming from someone finds IMAX a waste of money).Forget the bad reviews, haters gonna hate.","30 out of 59 found this helpful.

If you know what I mean, and are a fan of GITS, I just crushed your hopes hard). Also visually, when I thought about GITS (1995 version, which I loved), I picture something aesthetically pleasing and beautiful. For the live action movie, aside from the restaurant scene, which looked great, I didn't like the visuals much, felt kinda cheap (esp. the city). You can tell the director tried a bit, but all in all, it's lacking a soul. On a side note : The guy playing Batou was a good cast for the role , he got the job done.PS : And what was this BS with Kitano's dialogues ?!? Either have his dialogues in full Japanese, or in full English, but what they did here screams ""Takeshi did not want to speak English, and the cast didn't want to learn 3 words of Japanese"", it just felt plain awkward.","438 out of 1,077 found this helpful.

imho a beautifully crafted cyberpunk movie that while it does not reach to the levels of complexity of the original anime, it stand it's ground and deliver a great audiovisual experience with a story that is sophisticated enough to rise above most Hollywood movies today but not that much to alienate more mainstream viewers.
This is greatly underrated because it had to stand in the unfair comparison of the anime. I don't believe it is possible to replicate animes so just go and see it for what it is.
A great cyberpunk Hollywood production. It is rare for Hollywood to treat it's original material with respect while trying to simplify it to reach a bigger audience.","160 out of 179 found this helpful.

But what about the Ghost?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3678700/?ref_=tt_urv","asifahsankhan","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur55828906/?ref_=tt_urv","5 April 2017","These are the sorts of consciousness-expanding questions that have animated the ""Ghost in the Shell"" franchise for more than two decades. The world of GITS is part futuristic action movie and part philosophy lecture, in which artfully constructed animated action sequences serve as vehicles for investigations into the nature of consciousness. It's a showcase for what top-notch animation can do — one that the new movie never quite manages to match.However, it might take a few months—or maybe even a few years—but eventually, Scarlett Johansson's Ghost in the Shell will have an afterlife. The live-action adaptation of the Japanese classic is a complete Cyber Bore, narrative-wise, but for those who gush over big- screen artistry, there's plenty to get lost in: the opulent, expansive CGI visuals; the gorgeous Clint Mansell/Lorne Balfe score, pulsing and plunging like a Tangerine Dream nightmare; even Johansson's stoically acrobatic performance, which proves once again why she's one of the most in-demand action-film stars in the world. It's one of those films destined to be salvaged by the web, where the movie's defenders will advocate for it via frame-grab sprees or the occasional sub-Reddit threads. Ghost will find its followers.In the here-and-now, though, Ghost in the Shell is an all- encompassing embarrassment, the kind of movie you might not want to admit you watched—and which, judging from the box office, not a lot of people bothered to see in the first place. The film earned just $19 million domestically in its opening weekend, coming in third behind the still-running Beauty and the Beast and the surprise smash Oh Look, Alec Baldwin Is a Talking Baby, I Guess That's Cute to Some People? That crash came despite the fact that the latest version of Ghost—which is based on the long-running manga and anime series—was gifted with an estimated $110 million budget, a major star, a teen- baiting PG-13 rating, and a nearly 3,500-screen opening weekend. In what's been a notably healthy box-office year, Ghost should have shellacked the competition.But on the internet, Ghost has been a dud-in-the-making since at least January 2015, when Johansson's casting was first confirmed. The news set off a two-year-long preemptive outcry on the web, where online petitions and thoughtful Twitter threads addressed the film's whitewashing and cultural appropriation. That's been a point of contention with several works from the last year, including Doctor Strange, The Great Wall, and Netflix's Iron Fist, but Ghost in the Shell's transgressions were perhaps the most deeply felt: Here was a landmark piece of Japanese pop-culture—one whose what- does-it-mean-be-human? ideas and hacker-trash aesthetic had already been co-opted by US-produced films like The Matrix and AI—being re- imagined with a white American lead actress and an English director (Snow White and the Huntsman's Rupert Sanders). It didn't help that, a year before its release, rumours surfaced that the filmmakers had tested digital effects that would have allowed certain performers to ""shift their ethnicity"" so they could resemble Asian characters. By the time the film opened on Friday, it had shifted from ""problematic"" to full-on off-inducing: Wait, didn't we all agree this was a bad idea?The overall result is a movie that's all borrowed parts, with no depth or connection. The layers never quite come together to form something more. It wants to be a movie about the search for consciousness, but, unlike its source material, it doesn't have a soul.","17 out of 33 found this helpful.

Instead, it's  tepid. I didn't hate it, but it was a bit like a nice, but not great roller-coaster: nice entertainment for the moment, but nothing you write home about. It has lots of great CGI effects, but the characters are seriously lacking. It's like they didn't want to give the characters any texture or depth because that could detract the viewer from the special effects. I think this is more a question of direction and editing rather than acting. Typically, I feel I can re-watch a good sci-fi movie a couple times. Whether it's more action like Minority Report or more drama like Interstellar, the rewatchability factor to me is more a question about the feeling I get from watching the movie. Sadly, the rewatchability factor for this movie is basically 0 on my part. In the end, it's like watching a very long movie sequence in a video game - but in a video game, the film sequences are just a small part of the whole experience. And that's how this movie feels in the end: like it is lacking a big part of the experience.","266 out of 700 found this helpful.

Which talks about a future in which humans can enhance ourselves with robotic parts. The movie follows the story of Major, a woman whose body is 100% robotic, but her brain is human. Starting with Johansson's performance, her acting is quite stiff, similar to how we saw her in ""Lucy"" , this is comprehensible, since in the original film, Major's speech and mannerisms are very ""robotic"", however, it doesn't feel like Johansson achieved that, and her acting ends up looking forced even, which wouldn't be much of a problem if she weren't the main character and we saw her 99% of the whole movie. The film, compared to the original, is very easy to understand, everything is explained, either visually or in the script. The movie pretends to be reflexive, but it doesn't achieve it at the same level as the Japanese version. It's reflective in a way that appeals to the emotion. Visually, the film it's incredible, the weapon design and the design of the city are impeccable. The sequences of the city are incredible. However, this alone doesn't keep the movie afloat. Also, there are sequences that are straight up copied from the original film, but they don't evoke the same feelings. The action sequences are good, but they're definitely not up to par with the ones from the Japanese version, they don't generate the same feel and become predictable. The movie seems to be embellished more than it should, with unnecessary visual effects, sequences, and shots, which, on the long run, make the movie feel long and become quite boring. The original version works because, despite being simple, it's reflective, aesthetically beautiful and has an amazing soundtrack. However, and, leaving comparisons behind the movie works for what it is, a Hollywood remake that I'm sure the general public will enjoy.","75 out of 167 found this helpful.

Not only was the casting decision bad (emotionless actors reading off a terrible script that did not portray the characters correctly), but the director failed to notice many small details in the original that actually provided a deeper understanding of characters as well as the philosophical twist that was so iconic of the original.There were a lot of unnecessary characters and fight scenes added that did nothing for the emotional or philosophical aspect this movie should have been. The deviation from the original plot wasn't the problem. Rather, it was the deviation from the feel of the original.I normally love Sci-Fi, but this movie didn't make me think intellectually like other Sci-Fi's. It felt like they just took the look of the characters and universe, leaving behind the ""Ghost"" of the original, and placed them into a universe that had more explosions, guns, and blood.

She is dedicated to stopping and eliminating dangerous cyber criminals, but through exactly this process, she discovers her true identity and questions her existence.The poster looks really cool so I have high hopes for this film. Unfortunately, I was thoroughly bored by it. A person sitting behind me admitted the whole way through as well. The problem with the story is that it starts off looking really cool, but soon seems to have run out of money for computer graphics. Choosing to shoot many parts of the film in run down parts of Hong Kong doesn't enhance its glamour or appeal. I know this aspect is staying true to the original anime, but since they are changing so much of the story, they could have made the whole thing more glamorous. The mix between simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese, Japanese and even Korean texts on street signs is simply dizzying.The story is not very engaging for me. It doesn't convey our explain the plot points well. I find myself hoping it to end, and I thought it was way longer than the 97 minutes of runtime. One thing that is good is Batou, he gives off the fearless warrior vibe which is vital for this film. I am disappointed by this film. I thought it would be stylish and intelligent, but it isn't.","32 out of 75 found this helpful.

Many of the critics on here act like the 1995 original is perfect and god-like compared to this version, but just watching that one, I was surprised at how unrealistic the dialog is in that one, like a political propaganda film.Interestingly, people are criticizing the 2017 version for being too sexual, but the original makes her body almost indistinguishable from a human's body, whereas the 2017 version makes it fairly obvious that the body is not human.The 2017 film is not perfect, of course - the story lacks the depth of sci fi films that are more cerebral and drama based, rather than action based, but the story is nicely complex and the ending is not predictable. It is not the original, but there's no law that says it has to be.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

I went to see this movie trying to forget the anime, letting myself be surprised by the characters and plot. And must say that I really enjoyed the movie, especially that ""retro noir"", post apocalyptic atmosphere a la Blade Runner. I never expected to find the same scenes that appear on the anime, that would be a complete waste of time and effort. What would be the point on replicating the same scenes? Instead of that, the movie adds a slightly different approach compared to the original story and sacrifices some philosophical matters perhaps to keep the fast-paced of the action. Another aspect worth to mention is the original score, so magnificent, flowing with the scenes, helping to create that dark, robotic and apocalyptic look.","356 out of 411 found this helpful.

(ProTip: MAJOR is a rank, not a name) The studio exes simply wanted a ""Black Widow"" to sell movie tickets instead of accurately portraying the character. The character Motoko is supposed to know exactly who she is, where she comes from and her purpose, she is strong and cold, focused and brutal, a great leader part of an elite team, hardly sexual or feminine at all unless required for tactical reasons but instead we this typical generic mediocre default female lead version of Motoko.Pilou Asbæk is also a very bad representation of Batou, hes nothing like Batou physically or in character or even acting.Another case (and very typical recently) of the director not understanding the mythos, the very point and heart, of the thing they are trying to recreate and instead inflicting the audience with their own shallow misguided interpretation.Essentially the meaning and spirit of the story is completely lost in the 'hollywood washing' of the original concept, the characters thoroughly misrepresented and incorrectly portrayed.

This film has a strong thematic issue, a warm heart, a well developed character and good shaped story. If the original GITS was about the difference between man and machine, this movie is about identity. And it pushes it very far, reaching the boundaries of sexual identity as well.
Scarlett Johansson is a good choice as well, being both the badass heroine we expect and the fragile girl in quest of identity.

Well, bring your hate to me: 2017's Ghost in the Shell doesn't hold a neon-candle to its 1995 progenitor. Some of the intrigue, entertainment and beautiful sci-fi visuals hold over nicely, but where the original is a potent and mind-bending trip of sci-fi thoughts and action, this new one is awkwardly broad, surface-y, and plain sloppy. Like all artificial-intelligence stories, it's about what makes someone ""human"", with Johansson playing a cyborg with a human brain (""ghost"" in this world) searching for the originator of a deadly virus. Blade-Runner-like in many ways, it's a grimy world full of bright lights and mysterious characters. But where the original holds tightly to its effectively enigmatic nature, this one unnecessarily expands on backstory, spells-out themes, rolls-out unearned platitudes and projects emotions to such an extent that you wanna yell at the screen, ""We get it! This is all REAL important!"" At the center is Johansson. Her casting should be no surprise as she is currently a premier action heroine. However, she faced backlash after many saw her casting as the next in a long-line of Hollywood whitewashing Asian characters (Aloha, Great Wall). Ghost in the Shell has a fairly understandable explanation for her look, and even uses it thematically. However, that casting mixed with the frustrating plot changes point somewhere less noble: insurance of a franchise. Ultimately, the bare bones of sci-fi greatness are covered by insecurity, bringing us a dumb-down version of a great product.","19 out of 38 found this helpful.

It's great for those that prefer live action to anime -- and a great introduction of the anime story to the masses, but ultimately not a memorable movie in and of itself as it will always be overshadowed by its source material.

Despite being unintentionally humorous at times, her stilted posture, gait, dialogue delivery, and facial expressions BELONG in this film. They belong not only because the viewers are expected to believe Scarlett's character is sheltered, confused, and possibly in over hear head as an exploited yet proficient soldier, but they belong because the Major displayed the same idiosyncrasies in the 1995 anime. The Major has always been no-nonsense in her work, but she's also the one who drives the franchise's characteristic philosophical themes of ""self"" and personal identity in a futuristic world humans may not yet be ready for. To that extent, I applaud Scarlett's choices for the character.I can also see what the filmmakers were trying to do. The source material (namely, the 1995 anime and certain plot elements from the animated series) has clearly been researched, to an incredible degree. And from that research has come an incredibly vivid, beautiful, bustling, yet overwhelming and dangerous world. The level of detail -- from the mile-high holograms and over-the-top advertisements, to the subtle wires/electrodes/LED lights/prosthetics woven in and out of ""enhanced"" skin, to the breaking glass and ensuing mayhem of the ""Jump"" sequence -- is truly impressive. The sound design and sound editing are top-notch, with every booted footstep, metal clack of magazine reloads, blast of gunfire, and hallucinated ""glitch"" landing flawlessly. The music, while subtle, adequately does its part in supporting the futuristic yet sometimes bleak setting of the story.The characters (with the exception of Major, Batou, and the film's antagonist) are unfortunately given very little to say or do. There's so much more to these characters, and it's a real shame they weren't given the development they (and the movie) deserve. Despite this, I enjoyed (and believed) the chemistry between Major and Batou, with the latter providing his signature level-headedness and pathos to the former's insecurity and logos. The film's antagonist deserves special mention as well: The character provides a fascinating story arc, and the actor's portrayal of the character's speech and physical mannerisms are akin to a futuristic/omnipotent Joker.With that being said, I believe the movie's greatest fault is it's short run time. This, I'm guessing, had to do with the studio rather than the actors and filmmakers. Regardless, it really does impact the film. The editing feels forced and choppy, and certain parts of the story seem to have been cut short or eliminated completely. Director Rubert Sanders and cinematographer Jess Hall clearly want to draw out and savor their beautifully crafted scenes, but unfortunately someone somewhere opted instead for ""Nah, cut it there. No need for shots lasting longer than 2-3 seconds."" PG-13 audiences just don't have the attention span, sadly.It's wishful thinking, sure...but I'm holding out hope for a Director's Cut (""Blade Runner,"" anyone?). The makings for an incredible film are here, but the theatrical cut unfortunately falls short. The cast and crew deserve better. And the fans deserve to see what I believe was originally intended.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

First of all, this movie looks fantastic, the special effects are impressive, and through the film you really get a feel of the world they introduce. Also, the performances are all very solid, not only ScarJo, but the supporting cast as well. My favourite was the old Japanese man (if you saw the movie, you know who), who was a total badass. The action sequences were all very well shot and exciting. But the movie's biggest achievement is that by the third act I really cared for the characters, so during the final action sequence I was sitting on the edge of my seat, and rooted for the heroes to prevail.

The pacing was off and even in what should have been exciting fight scenes I was not captured and I was even yawning. The pacing was really off, which made the film a relatively sub-par watch that I'm sad I spent cinema money on.","16 out of 36 found this helpful.

I've watched Stand Alone Complex and 2nd Gig multiple times, watched the movies multiple times, even got Richard Epcar (the voice actor of Batou) to sign GITS: Innocence on DVD, and so forth.Here is what people are not getting. Stand Alone Complex has very little to do with the manga. Movies like Solid State Society have very little to do with the manga. Yet these, in my opinion, capture the best of the character development and the GITS universe. If all we had were the GITS movies and the manga, nobody would care about GITS. Variations from the original story are what make the franchise succeed.Secondly, have you watched Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence lately? Or even the new GITS: Arise films? The writers tend to go way overboard. I wouldn't even call it ""philosophical,"" it is just a giant wall of text that voice actors callously read. The writing can get way too complicated and wordy for no reason to the point where the movies get emotionless, cold, and even boring in some parts. This happens sometimes, not all of the time.Here is the lesson: it is okay to change trivial parts of the lore, like when Batou gets his eyes or which, if any, family members the Major meets. The specifics really, truly do not matter, as long as it tells the same story.Visually the film was absolutely amazing. The music was amazing. The casting, by far my biggest gripe going in, actually worked out. They did a good job.My two main issues: the PG-13 action and slight dumbing down of the story.Production IG is so incredibly good at drawing and animating weapons, gun fights, fist fights, that it's hard to live up to the action scenes, especially if one chooses to remove blood and violence in order to get a PG-13 rating. This took away from the film for sure. There was little to no punch in many of the action scenes.GITS's story can go in so many brilliant directions. It's not that this film had a dumb script or a dumb story, it's that in comparison it wasn't as brilliant as the TV shows or other movies. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, because as I mentioned sometimes the animated GITS movies go overboard, but one does notice that some of the brilliance is lacking.The film was extremely successful at creating its own GITS-compatible style. It created a metropolis far better than any of the other GITS films. The synthwave music was fitting and very atmospheric. It surpassed the anime in these areas.Those bashing the film and giving it 1/10 are dishonest, misanthropic neckbeards, in Japan known as otakus, and you should refrain from giving these reviews any your time.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

Unsure if this was art, action, syfy, thriller. The jumps between action scenes to badly crafted ""pigeon flights"" made it very difficult to watch and a clearer direction would have helped.Casting - Really poor. Channel 4's ""Humans"" offered a more watchable performance. Very difficult to like anyone in this other than the Japanese cast. Action - This was a poor mans Matrix.Visual - While stunning it was over played and complicated. Compared to Colin Farrell's ""Total Recall"" it was a very weak showing. Keep it Simple!Music - Outstanding, I will be downloading the Soundtrack ASAP. However, in line with the Direction all the music was played at the wrong time and wrong scenes. Ground Breaking - I was hoping to put this in the genre of Blade Runner. Sadly I don't think this will go down in history for anything other than a hashed out movie.

If you miss some part of the Anime, go watch it again. The Anime nerds ripping it apart should consider live action adaptations are going to pull back to low budget B flicks from all of the ignorant reviews.

The universal existential and philosophical questions posed by the anime on what it means to be human have been dumb-ed down to ideas of 'individuality' and 'memories' that are further reduced in their appeal by being explained in a very western (non-universal) inflection.The explanation itself is another problem. Rather than allowing the audience to decide on their own opinion, the movie insists on spoon- feeding us with preconceived answers. It's very patronizing BS.Lastly, I have problems with ScarJo's performance. Rather than making the Major her own character, the actress gave us a performance that's somewhere between MCU's Black Widow 2.0 and Lucy. It seems to me that ScarJo is not a very multifaceted actress and isn't equipped for the job of giving the Major its own personality.To conclude: this is not a 'bad' movie, I've certainly seen worse SF flicks. But it's not a 'good' movie either. It doesn't challenge me intellectually, nor does it touch me on an emotional level. It's a stone-cold cash grab flick (and even flopped on that front, if current reports are to believed). The only really good thing it has going for it are the quite prettily shot scenes, but that's not enough to save a movie.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

This movie takes place in the far future and revolves around Major, a cybernetic being with a human brain who is the first of her kind. She is used as a weapon to stop dangerous criminals, and when a hostile hacker begins taking control of people's minds, Major goes on a journey to discover more about herself and her surroundings.Many people are hating on this film because they are disappointed in the fact that it doesn't fit every aspect of the original 1995 film into the run time. Having never seen the anime, I don't have a connection to the original like others do. This film works on it's own. Without comparing this Ghost in the Shell with the first one, it is a competent film. In my opinion, many critics have depended on the anime too much and let it cloud their vision of the film as a whole.The visuals are fantastic. Not a shot goes by that doesn't look great. All the special effects are really well done, incorporate brilliantly with in-camera work. The music is also great. The original 1995 score was replaced, which also had people running around in a tizzy. However, for me, I thought the soundtrack is one of the best of 2017 so far.The characters, especially Major played by Scarlet Johansson, are pretty well-written. You get to know and feel for Major very well throughout the film as she goes through many series of self discovery. The plot flows pretty nicely as well, although the main flaw also comes here.The main flaw of this movie was the pacing. It begins very fluidly and doesn't leave you bored; however there's a good twenty minute stretch towards the middle that could have been written differently to make it less of a drag. A few sub plots are introduced that really aren't necessary, and the final battle went for a more CGI, action type where I would have preferred a silent, psychological climax.Despite it's flaws, Ghost in the Shell is a solid film that was an overall entertaining watch.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Both movies has trace of connection to Hong Kong and China, with funding from The Shaw Brothers (Blade Runner) and Shanghai Film Grp/Huahua Media (GITS) (Ref: Wong Kin Yuen (2000) On the Edge of Spaces: Blade Runner, Ghost in the Shell , and Hong Kong's Cityscape - http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/backissues/80/wong80art.htm). If you did read on how GITS 1995 Anime was produced, the anime has strong influence on Blade Runner of how the cityscape reflected the mass flow and excess influx of information - neon signs, messy town planning, dark alleys, rainy days.So GITS anime then utilised Hong Kong as base of set for Niihama-shi, or New Port City in the manga, and so the movie does.The ultra complex and crammed cityscape of Hong Kong truly fits a dystopian world and set - but you have to see and create beyond that. The movie inadequately stuff these elements into the already-there Central, Yau Ma Tei, Jordan, Sham Shui Po, Tsim Sha Tsui, Kwun Tong Harbourfront, Lai Tak Tsuen and Causeway Bay, while I couldn't feel a sense of disorder, or how it was linked to information deluge - they are only futuristic sets, no more. As Hongkonger, the set rather likes Blade Runner and filled with wrongly typed or meaningless Japanese wording like ""high"" ""so high"" ""Innocence""(Ok it actually refers to the second anime in same font). In the anime, there was even a rightly sang Cantonese song! It's shot in Hong Kong, yet not even Hong Kong or anywhere else in a future world. The disconnection to the set's cultural background is misplaced.Beyond the set, all I have in mind is Total Recall and RoboCop. The manga was a 1991 rightfully done cyberpunk work with extended footnotes on the technology mentioned. The 1995 anime however, indeed twisted the plot into a discussion of oriental side of identity, self, existence, Buddhism & Shindao & Zen. In this movie? Major sounds like Murphy in RoboCop...","11 out of 24 found this helpful.

Simply put: too easy for old fans and too hard for young ones. For example I am a fan of the 1995 manga movie but I really liked this one even though it wasn't as deep as the first movie.

The forgettable plot leaves me cold. It probably should have started with the memory of her barely surviving the terrorist attack. It would have opened the movie with a great action sequence and also concentrated on the concept of memories by zeroing in on that event.

It has plenty of stunning visuals and action sequences to entertain you throughout, but the film is lacking of anything new to deepen the original story (aside from a few backstory elements). All the things that made the 1995 film memorable, like the thought provoking philosophies and slow pace that made it deep and challenging, are lost in order to have a more entertaining and easy to understand blockbuster experience. They even added the common ""American corporate"" type villain to give the audience a more defined antagonist. And though the film does mirror key scenes from the original (such as the diving scene or the water fight), they end up rushing over them anyways, once again losing important information to the hands of nostalgia. Remaking this film in 2017 could have been a great chance to include today's issues, but instead it was wasted for box office numbers.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

This combines the enhanced functionality of cyborg with the ability of free thought and will. She is to become a perfect soldier in the war on cyber-criminals.Right, well the story was adequate enough, although it was a bit too mundane and simplistic, almost to the point where it bordered on being too generic. The events that took place throughout the course of the story offered no surprises, as it was quite predictable. And given the premise of the movie, then you already knew the outcome of the movie from the very beginning.As for the acting, well I will say that they had some good enough talents to portray the characters and roles, and it was essentially Pilou Asbæk who carried the movie. Personally, I don't understand why they opted for Scarlett Johansson for the lead, because she is not a particularly versatile actress in my opinion. And in ""Ghost in the Shell"" she put on a very bland and emotionless performance. It was a real shame that Michael Wincott didn't have a bigger role in this movie, because he could definitely have added a lot to the movie.What made this movie watchable was the impressive display of special effects and CGI. It was just overwhelming, especially because there was so much of it in almost every single scene. So if all those holographic images in the cityscape becomes a reality, it will indeed be a colorful future that we greet.I wasn't particularly impressed with ""Ghost in the Shell"", and the myriad of special effects were hardly enough to make due for a lack of interesting storyline. As such, this was but a mere mediocre movie experience for me. I doubt that it is a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time.","22 out of 47 found this helpful.

What it is, is a breathtaking re-imagining based upon that wonderful Manga. The cinematography is, in my opinion, absolutely stunning. Both bright and vibrant whilst showing a dark and gritty life within the city. I have heard talk that this film will be negatively affected by reports of ""white-washing"", I had no idea this term existed before reading a review of the movie. Scarlett Johanssons portrayal of The Major is fabulous. Had she been half as good as she was then maybe people could deride the films choice for lead actress. However she shines. The subtle nuances she brings to The Major's character are sublime. She can do so much just with slight facial expressions that convey so much more than words. Forget what you might have read, merit walks and Scarlett Johansson has merit to spare from her work here. The other main characters are well done too. Batou is exactly what I imagined he should be, based upon the original. The understated yet complex interplay between him and The Major is a delight to watch. The film maybe doesn't have some of the existential depth of the original Manga. There aren't as many questions asked or nuances of human psychology explored. However, unless you'd seen the original you wouldn't know they were missing. The film lacks for nothing. As a fan of the original Ghost in the Shell I am more than happy to recommend this movie, based on it's merits! It's not a bright shiny Marvel movie, it's not Inception either. It is worth your time to make up your own mind and definitely worth the price of a cinema ticket!","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

With her other ongoing ""Avengers"" superhero work as Natasha Romanoff, and nothing much else beyond that other than brief cameos (""Hail Caesar"", ""Hitchcock"") and voice work, its all getting a bit 'samey': I'd like to see her get back to her more dramatic roles like ""Lost in Translation"" that really launched her career.Anyhoo, back to this flick. Set in the dazzling fictional Japanese city of Niihama, Johansson plays a terrorist victim saved only by having her brain transplanted into an android by the Hanka corporation. In this time (40 years in the future) human 'upgrades' with cybernetic technology are commonplace, but Major is a 'first of a kind' experiment. Hanka are not pure humanitarians though, since they have turned Major into a lethal fighting weapon with powers of invisibility and lightning reactions. She works for a shadowy anti- terrorism unit called Section 9, led by the Japanese speaking Aramaki (Takeshi Kitano, ""Battle Royale"").The upside of having no human form is that if you get burned or blown up, the team of cyber-surgeons back at Hanka, led by Dr. Ouelet (Juliette Binoche), can rebuild her - - they ""have the technology"" to quote another bionic hero.But all is not necessarily well in the idyll of anti-terrorist slashing and burning. Major suffers from recurring 'glitches' of memories from her past life: a life that she has no clear memories of. Her latest mission against a deformed and vindictive terrorist called Kuze (Michael Pitt) progressively resurfaces more of these memories, since Kuze clearly knows more about Major than she does.""Ghost in the Shell"" looks glorious, with the Hong Kong-like city being in the style of Blade Runner but with more holograms. (What exactly the holograms are supposed to be doing or advertising is rather unclear!). The cinematography and special effects deserve an Oscar nomination. Given the film is based on an original Manga series, written and illustrated by Masamune Shirow and well known for its complexity, this Hollywood version has a surprisingly simple and linear story. As such it may disappoint the hoard of fans who adore the original materials.Treating it as a standalone film, it should have an emotional depth beyond the superficial action, dealing as it does with loyalty and family ties. However, the scripting and editing is rather pedestrian making the whole thing a bit dull. Johansson and Pilou Asbæk, as her co-worker Batou, breathe what life they can into the material; but Binoche is less convincing as the Dr Frankenstein-style doctor. The best act in the piece though is Takeshi Kitano as the kick-ass OAP with attitude. Where I had particular issues was in some of the detail of the action. 'Invisibility' is an attribute that needs to be metered out very carefully in the movies: Harry Potter just about got away with it; in ""Die Another Day"" it nearly killed the Bond franchise for good. Here, exactly how the androids can achieve invisibility is never explained and I disliked that intently. Similarly, the androids can clearly be physically damaged, yet Major seems to start each mission by throwing herself headfirst off the tallest skyscraper. Again, never explained. Even though the premise, and the opening titles, brought back bad memories of that truly terrible Star Trek episode ""Spock's Brain"", this is a dark and thoughtful adaptation with great CGI effects but unfortunately its pedestrian pace means it is one that never truly breaks through into the upper echelons of Sci Fi greatness. Worth a watch though.(For the full review, with graphics, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com. Thanks.)","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

This together with Akira (1988) are the epitomes of cyber tech-porn, the crowned jewels of apocalyptic Japanese animation. The future world depicted in Ghost in the Shell is alluring, but sad. It is uber-violent on the surface, but a deep melancholy runs beneath that surface. Its themes of alienation and identity beat with a strong pulse. Coupled with a superb atmosphere, dense plot, kinetic action sequences, dizzying ideas, opaque characters, mystical spiritualism and an outstanding music score, the anime earns its place as a much beloved cult-classic. Do we even need an Americanized live action version?Thankfully, this Rupert Sanders film isn't just a simplistic money-grab exercise. There is meticulous care in recreating the futuristic world designed by Oshii and it is a nice move not to transpose the world to some Neo-Los Angeles or NYC. In that sense, the film honours the spirit of the anime. It didn't stop there - some of the iconic action scenes are replicated, almost shot for shot. The story is updated and feels entirely understandable now with a crystal clear resolution; it feels almost dumbed down especially with the heavy expositional second act. I don't know about you, but for me this updated story reminds me so much of Robocop, a cyber-policeman haunted by residual memories of his human past. Yes, this is one watchable movie filled with technical and visual wizardry, but it couldn't carry forth the sense of melancholy so evident in the original. Yes, Scarlett Johansson does cut a fine figure as Major Motoko and she channels an extension of her cypher alien character from Under the Skin (if the mention of this movie makes you cringe, consider it fair warning that you won't see empathetic pathos). Yes, the music borrows heavily from Kenji Kawai's evocative original (why touch an awesome original which is an identity itself). So why is there a remake if it is just content to languish behind the glossy sheen and not want to push the envelope further with a story feels so familiar. This feels deceptively like one giant homage to the original and I am sure it will make money by the truckloads. I had one worry playing on repeat in my head as I walked out of the cinema - am I ready to be bombarded by Hollywoodized versions of Akira, Trigun, Cowboy Bebop, Patlabor, Appleseed...... I don't want to ponder this scary thought anymore. Thankfully, I will always have the animes. That's it; I am so watching the Oshii classic again right now.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

The truth is, even if this is a remake, it should stand on its own with no needed comparisons to the original, something I usually don't quite follow (I tend to watch the original film in order to understand better the remake, reboot, live-action adaptation, whatever). However, I do know about the huge influence that Ghost in the Shell (1995) had on great movies from the past and I also understand that it's one of the best anime movies ever made, based on most fans and critics' opinions.With that in mind, this version of Ghost in the Shell it's definitely far from that. Its story goes from interesting and captivating to a boring, slow-paced film with surprisingly just ""ok"" action scenes. The concept of the whole film is really something amazing: Major searching for answers (does she have a soul? Is she human? Is she a cyborg? Are there more like her or is she really different?) and the visually stunning world (that's definitely where the budget went to) are key elements to the film ... In concept ... Execution-wise, well, not that much.Scarlett Johansson does a great job and her character has a compelling backstory, as well as Kuze (Michael Pitt), who I think could have been more explored. Batou (Pilou Asbaek) is also a great side-character and an excellent partner for Major, I thoroughly enjoyed the scenes with them together (action-wise and not). The soundtrack is what astound me the most, it's really memorable and I have it on my Spotify playlist already. It's amazing.The big problem with this film is its execution. Rupert Sanders isn't able to moderate the pacing with the character development scenes, therefore a dull, boring and uneventful second act comes to life. The action that the trailers show are really the best that the movie has since the rest is super choppy. I don't understand how an actress as Scarlett Johansson, who does most of her own stunts and choreography in the Marvel universe, isn't able to perform a sequence without dozens of cuts between (bad director?).Furthermore, the ""villain"" feature of the movie isn't that great either. They try to put up a twist at the beginning of the third act and switch things a bit ... It didn't work. I can't really go in detail, but it's a failed try to boost up the film and end it with a thrilling finale.All in all, Ghost in the Shell has an excellent concept that is badly executed. The story itself is interesting and deserves the beautifully captured CGI that gives birth to a whole new stunning world, as well as the amazing soundtrack. Scarlett Johansson is as compelling as her character (I honestly don't understand what's the ""whitewash"" problem that Hollywood keeps trying to fault movies for) and the supporting cast also does a great job. Execution-wise, the movie faults due to its slow-pace which brings the whole film down to an extremely boring second act. The action is disappointingly directed and the villain should have been a lot better.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

The film is nice to look at. They spent a lot of time working on the visual aspects of the movie and it shows. I saw this in 3D and was surprised by the explosion of eye candy. I do not enjoy 3D films often, but I did enjoy 2017 Ghost in the Shell's refreshed environment from the original anime.Now, let's get into why I did not like this movie as a fan boy. It wasn't the whitewashing controversy. This controversy is a social paradigm which lives outside the boundaries of this film and I am a believer film should be judged on the merits of its compilation of techniques and handling of content. Whether the character is Japanese or American didn't and doesn't bother me. What bothered me was the complete gutting of the cerebral aspects of the original film. The original Ghost in the Shell anime created a cult following due to its deep philosophical material. They dumb downed a classic. It's almost as if they took Plato and turned into a coloring book. When the impressive visual display is taken away, 2017 Ghost in the Shell is a ghost-less attempt to recreate a masterpiece.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

It was a good movie, not as good as the original 1995 Ghost in the Shell movie, but that bar is so high few movies would qualify. Scarlett Johansson was almost perfect in the role, the only issues was she lacked the ""Dirty Harry"" confidence of the original movie. However in this movie she was only beginning her career, while in the 1995 movie she was an old timer who was ending her career, so that can be explained. The technique of having Aramaki speak Japanese worked, although he mumbled too much and I originally though he was speaking mandarin. I gave up trying to understand his Japanese and simply read the subtitles instead. When I saw Togusa for the first time, that fact he was Japanese confused me. For those who watch Japanese anime, almost everyone looks like a Caucasian, so I was use to that look. However once I realised why I was confused it all worked very well, as if I was watching an all-Japanese cast anime movie, such as Black Butler (which is also excellent). The only real issue was too much was being covering in the movie; it was too fast and lacked the feeling of the original 1995 movie as a result. You could easily resolve it by extending the movie and if I owned the rights that is what I would do, perhaps create two movies from the material. That way you could capture the slow motion and surreal scenes of the original movie, such as when Motoko rises up from the water. As for the controversy about race, we are not dealing with any type of objectivity. I simply ignored any of those comments as those who make them clearly lack an understanding of anime. Saying that it was good the movie was set in Japan and Aramaki reported to the prime minister, rather than the president. 優れた In summary, a good movie with excellent potential, which could have been done better and which could easily be reworked to remove the major issues outlined above.","166 out of 194 found this helpful.

I'm always down for original science fiction, and although this is a live-action remake of a beloved anime, it seemed original enough for my liking. While every frame is gorgeous, there isn't a ton under the surface with this adaptation.Putting casting controversies aside, Scarlett Johansson provides a compelling performance as 'The Major' amidst plenty of other talented actors and actresses. Takeshi Kitano and Pilou Asbæk are particularly good, rounding out the cast in this futuristic sci-fi. The acting is superb, the visuals are intricate, and the action is visceral, but you need more than that to win over an audience. The one thing this film is really missing is heart and humanity. There are small attempts to polish the characters with human qualities here and there, but nothing to make me truly care about the characters. Sadly, the only reason I was invested in Major was because it's Scar-jo being a bada** action hero. It's kind of like 'Lucy' in that way, though it's much more of a focused and controlled story than that.Much like 'Power Rangers' this past week, there's nothing overtly wrong with Ghost in the Shell, but there's not anything that will come across as overtly memorable either. It's one of those action- revenge films that you'll find on cable or Netflix down the road and you may watch bits and pieces, but you won't watch the entire film because you've seen it all before. The classic ""everything they told you was a lie"" is written all over the story, as is the trope of having the A.I. go rogue on her creators. You see it in every movie like this, so I can't say the film's originality is its greatest quality.With that said, I haven't seen the original anime, so perhaps this was just a faithful adaptation of a film that's been copied over and over throughout the years. I wanted to go in fresh with this one, and I came out pleased that I saw it, but far from impressed. Although colorful in its appearance, the dark brooding tone washes away the chance of re-watching it a few times. Having said all of this, I'm still game for sequels and more stories in this world. I find these types of movies fascinating and usually beautiful to look at, I just wish the characters were fleshed out with more humanity. Hopefully, this film is successful enough to get more anime's adapted.+Scarjo kills it as always+Gorgeous-Not much to these characters-We've seen it all before6.6/10","10 out of 24 found this helpful.

I want my $7.50 back because that was a waste of 2 hours.","79 out of 201 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Vibrant futuristic world and basic plot, it's a simple sci-fi wearing skin of Ghost in the Shell, beautiful it may be.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3673812/?ref_=tt_urv","quincytheodore","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur43363139/?ref_=tt_urv","29 March 2017","Looking at the highlights of Ghost in the Shell, one can see the spirit of the original series from the quirky scenery and heavy eye candy. Fans and casual audience would appreciate the effort, but Ghost's world is notoriously riddled with complex, even philosophical undertone, and in attempt to make it simpler, the movie became a streamlined sci-fi thriller.First spotlight falls on the Mayor (Scarlett Johansson). This is a very daunting character to translate to big screen as she has barely shown any emotions across the series, yet there's a sense of guile, charm and slyness within. Conveying underlying emotions while looking stoic, also in runtime of a movie, can be a challenge. Not to mention she has makeover across animation series, so there will be most likely any disagreement regardless of whoever cast.Fortunately, Scar Jo provides more than just the big name allure. For most she carries herself well, there are occasional faint glows of hidden humanity, they are not as pronounced or often yet serendipitously fits the character. Still, content doesn't help much with the usual self-doubt and mundane thriller troupes. That being said, Scar Jo dons the main heroine's suit as effectively and captivatingly as possible.This futuristic world is not without its charm, a trait the movie showcases with high rise building and holographic ads plastered across the horizon every time it changes location or scene. Thankfully, the angle, little details and cinematography for major set pieces stay true to the original vibe. If anything, the occupants of this world are not fully fleshed out. The villain is lacking in sense of dread and perhaps only a couple of characters aside Mayor get any significant development.Action might remind audience of The Matrix, rightfully so as the two are inspired by one another. It provides undoubtedly stunning visual, one on the wetland is especially impeccable. The cosmetic, gadgetry and suits offer enhance futuristic world even more. It's appreciated that, at the very least, the studio went to such extend to honor the original source.The impressive visual trinkets and the cast of Scarlett Johansson help elevate the movie adaptation, one would find something charming in the damp futuristic world. However, with basic plot and crude development, the movie feels like an ordinary sci-fi wearing the skin of Ghost in the Shell.","10 out of 24 found this helpful.

It's a tribute to the film that it takes quite a long time before the first minor inconsistencies arise. But the spirit of the original has been replaced with the spirit of a police procedural. The shell however is well executed - and suffers only from the inevitable feeling that this should be a series not a film.The Japanese original material was far more technical and much less emotional than this adaption - where you get the feeling that most of the characters are the usual Americans with mummy issues. Most of what is good is almost certainly dragged in from Beat Takeshi (who gives not a f*ck about Hollywood).In some ways this is both reasonably faithful and perfectly watchable. That it is a squeezed into the formal corset of a studio picture you already knew and can't seriously complain about. Watch, enjoy, forget, and keep the original on DVD.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

I liked it quite a bit. Scarlet does a good job as the cyborg and the other supporting cast is good too.This movie takes on big similarities but yet crucial differences than the 1995 movie, to the point where you can say they are related and similar in many ways, but ultimately different and lead in directions. Most say the 1995 anime is a much deeper & complex story, I think it's somewhat true, but IMHO not really any much better than the 2017 version. I guess you could say the 1995 version takes it a step further, but I actually liked the dynamics of the 2017 version a bit better. In either case I think both were good and unique in their own waysWhile Scarlet was obviously in really good shape for this (who knows if that her body or just a CGI replica) but it was good how even know it was in a sense her ""skin"" they didn't give her nipples and such as it would have turned it into a cheap flesh flick for sure. Even know the 1995 version did that, still it was an anime, so they can kind of get away with it vs. real life. Kind of like showing gratuitous alien blood is no problem, but human blood is a whole different ratings scale.For those who are loyal to the original version, they might find this a cheap knock off, I saw this first and then watched the 1995 version. In the end I liked them both although I liked the 2017 version better, great effect, and IMHO a bit more believable story, but then again I'm not huge on anime's either, so...","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

"4","/10","A Mediocre SF Movie, slapped with GItS Label","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3674725/?ref_=tt_urv","thesavior-02480","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur74536866/?ref_=tt_urv","31 March 2017","First of all I have to make it clear, I'm one of the original GItS fan, so I don't think that my POV could represent everyone. However I feel like I just got scammed that's why I'm compelled to make an account just for this movie. Next, I have to say that putting aside the GItS label this movie are just your usual mediocre SF with crisp visual, the setting of GItS has inspired so many works over time, which ironically resulted in said GItS re-adaptation 22 years later seems cliché by comparison. However to this date there's hardly any adaptation that managed to be as thought provoking as GItS, which is why I had hopes for this adaptation could capture that essence. In reality?? I bet 10 bucks that midway through the movie most of you guys will have a general idea as how the movie will progress, the story are just that generic. Now that I got that covered, let's get to the main dish. First the casting, I'm not bothered by whitewashing and honestly SJ done great as Major, and Pilou Asbæk are perfect at his role as Battou. Honestly the casting are perfect. however I found the name change to be unnecessary but that's my opinion. Next Visual, I found no fault in it, and I love their car selection which are quite accurate with the original GItS. Now.. time for main part, the plot or rather the theme. I'm sure there's billion fans already grumbling about the plot which is why I won't repeat it, however I must say that the biggest fault of this supposedly 'adaptation' is that they throw all of the original's soul or rather 'ghost' out of the window to make it simpler and more appealing to western audience; which arguably are unnecessary considering heavy movie like interstellar and Inception are widely received as positive, while trying to market it as GItS. If I were to write in detail why this movie are not Ghost in The Shell then I doubt that 1k words will be enough however I must raise this fatal one, this movie failed to address the question of Evolution in cybernetics society, it instead offer us a cheap justice and bad romance to fill the hole that such heavy theme left us. Conclusion? Another Hollywood attempt to sell us garbage by attaching shiny label. At the very least it's way better than DBZ and Avatar, however it still lose to Edge of Tomorrow in term of adaptation. P.S Once again I have to say that this is a subjective review from original GItS fans, I'm sure someone who never touched the originals will have different opinion from mine.","18 out of 38 found this helpful.

It is somewhat discouraging to see the many praising ""10"" reviews or equally the many ""1"" or ""2"" reviews saying this movie is trash. Neither extreme is accurate, the movie is well-made and entertaining for anyone with a mind open to being entertained.Original 2017 comments: My wife and I watched this at home on DVD from our public library. I have been seeing trailers for this movie for a time now and have been anxious to see it, plus I have been a Scarlett Johansson fan since her 1998 role in ""The Horse Whisperer.""In the way of background, back in the late 1980s and the 1990s a series of books were published in Japan, Ghost in the Shell, known in Japan as Mobile Armored Riot Police. The ""ghost"" refers to the soul that people have and ""the shell"" refers to taking a person's surviving brain, with soul, and transplanting it into a sophisticated robot ""shell"".Set in the future, in an unnamed Japanese city, in this movie Scarlett Johansson is introduced to us as ""Major"" and she works for the fictional counter-cyber-terrorist organization Public Security Section 9. We later find out her full name is Major Motoko Kusanagi.As the movie opens we see Major on what looks like an operating table, she is having difficulty processing who she is and where she is. She is told that of her family she is the lone survivor of a boat disaster and they were able to save her brain and ""ghost"" and she now has a new ""shell"" of a body. She simply assumes they are finding a way to save her.However later she finds out she has been deceived, she is part of a broader experimental program to create agents like her. Yet she is a special agent to fight cyber crime. I enjoyed the movie for the Sci-Fi aspects of it but the movie isn't always easy to follow and is filled with guns and shootings, too much big guns and shooting, as it seems most movies like this have these days. The characterizations are well done as well as the visuals and sounds.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

What I think is the biggest downside of the movie, is it focused a bit too much on the story of the individual Kusanagi, where the anime had some amazing extencial questioning.Pilou Asbæk carries the role as Batou very well, and there is probaly no one more suitable than Scarlett Johanson for the lead role.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was absolutely beautiful in its settings and character designs. No one can deny that it is visually on par with or exceeds the best Hollywood has put out. I found the adaptation stalling in places. Where the filmmaker seemed to expect drama to build it seemed, to me, that it stalled. Some of the fight scenes with the Major were amazing. I just wish the story was more compelling in its translation. The lesson should be that if Hollywood would just adapt the source material without trying to make it all things to all people the movie would find its audience. By watering down the story, it just makes it meh to the uninitiated and alienates the long time fans.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Every single line is just declamatory, like each actor is reading from the outline for a script rather than dialog meant for any specific character.

Later one Geisha-bot tells The Major, ""Commit to the will of Hanka and be destroyed."" The Major is beginning to have glimpses of a former life and cannot figure things out. It isn't until later, the main terrorist Kuze (Michael Pitt) tells her what Hanka Robotics has done. You needed the above because this was quite confusing in the beginning and many of the dialogues went nowhere and we did see sub- titles when Aramaki talks to Cutter (Peter Ferdinando), who is the head of Hanka Robotics and wants The Major, his prize asset, to be kept safe. In his view all humanity will be like her to win wars. She is the perfect soldier. Much of the fighting is in darkened scenes with the camera speeded up so no one can actually tell what is going on and here all we are concerned with is that our girl, The Major, comes out on top and she does. So don't worry. Did I mention that The Major is very pretty? Well, she is. When we first see The Major in a fight, it looks like she is naked. Well, a robot doesn't really need clothes, does one? Anyway you can tell The Major is wearing a skin-like body suit. So no real nudity and yes, we are looking hard to be sure. (I bet ) I suppose in the book she is really naked. (Is there a book?)The setting is in Japan and one would think Japanese would be spoken, but we get it all in English except for when Aramaki talks and then we see sub-titles, but it's all good. Oh, they did make Johansson look somewhat oriental. Notables: Anamaria Marinca as Dr Dahlin who basically put The Major together and repairs her after fights; and Pilou Asbaek as Batou, The Major's partner. This guy is nothing but huge and did a good job as did everyone. A kind of funny thing happened. The Major needs information from a dead Geisha-bot and she decides to Deep Dive into the Geisha-bot's memories. Yes, quite scary but exciting, too, all in the dark, of course and while there in the Deep Dive she sees Kuze, the terrorist she needs to kill. Then something almost goes wrong and Dr. Dahlin pulls her out of the induced trance. It's kind of funny because if we need information we look for a memory chip. There is sort of a disconnect in her human name. We are told she is Mira, but when she looks at her tombstone it says her name is Motoko. Oh, in this future we still see people smoking and drinking beer. Some things never change. You will see hologram ads on the buildings in the city. Necessary? Probably not. This is a good Sci-fi story, but I felt some things were left out, but we did see The Major's mother and that was a good catch. I think we needed to see some of those glimpses of the former human life The Major had and her reactions to them. Hey, we like to see close-ups of Scarlett Johansson. See? (Got it) (7/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Most of the time. And the bad robot guy is a good actor. And that's it. Seriously, this movie left NO impression on me. The acting was non-existent; the script made me cringe within the first minute (""she's not a person to me; she's a weapon!"" So original. So well- formulated); you get NO feeling for any of the characters at ALL, as they are given an almost explicit lack of any type of backstory; speaking of story, was there any? What was this movie really about? I don't know. I'd basically forgotten I'd watched it while I walked out the theater. Scarlett Johansson is terrible. She has this frowny, stupid face throughout the movie, which makes NO sense: she has a human brain: she can emote however she likes. But she doesn't.

It's visually very attractive, Johansson is convincing together with the rest of the cast and the movie has a good pace. But the script lacks depth and is at some points too shallow and not convincing. I love the cyberpunk genre, but that's mostly due to the intrecate storylines and fhe depiction of a dark corperate led world. GITS misses this.

I haven't seen Arise yet.I've been waiting for this title to come out, I've also been satisfied with the choice of Scarlett Johansson for the lead, I usually like her movie performances, but they are a bit light.That is also the case here, she was nowhere close to the original badassery of the anime, she simply does not possess the physical weight and strength to pull off those moves.So, I've sat down to watch the movie, and for some time I could not decide whether this was a prequel or a remake (or another parallel universe, as with SAC), as the character was very inexperienced, but the major plot points and visual elements were there - turned out to be a bit of both. I am OK with this, but I would have favored a live action remake.The visuals, the sounds and music, the casting of characters and the atmosphere is very authentic (though faster in pace), cgi is sometimes a bit cheap, especially in contrast with the anime.The story is a bit simplified from the original, but fun, and interesting with lots of well handled action.In all, it is a fun, light action movie in a sci-fi setting, that is overshadowed by the original.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Hollywood sigh, I thought we were over this bad behavior.Every character expect for batou's dog got a serious downgrade in intelligence and depth making for a group of highly skilled idiots jumping from one scene to the next. It's such a pity because each character in the original could easily uphold a film for themselves. Visually it's fairly similar as they have taken shot for shot views which can look gorgeous. Scenes not directly in the original can look a bit flashy and unrealistic. They have attempted to imbue some philosophy in here and failed big time.

Actually i m not an anime guy at all, and only watched the most important Anime movies, for the sake of my cultural ascension. And boy am i glad ,i never watched it, so i could not possibly get ButtHurt. But i should also admit, That i'm a huge fan of sc-fi , and cyber-punk, And my Top 10 movies includes Dark city, Matrix, Fifth Element, Blade runner,and Robocop for example, So i m all into this Genre.What can i say about this flawless movie, that has the best directing of action scenes since Matrix 1? That has The most detailed and rich set designs in any action movie ever? That has unbelievable Cgi , and special effects. That should get a Oscar for a costume design? A movie that finally doesn't have horrible hip hop , or dubstep soundtrack? Main actor that is a most bad-ass women in universe , and is so beautiful to look at that you get depressed about yourself.? I seriously can not admire enough , the efforts that were put in the making of this movie. The evidence of hard work by the whole crew, is just everywhere. Nobody would plan everything in such a detail if they weren't fans of the original, and can you even imagine how hard is to make exact replica of a scene that was originally only drawn on a paper with a pencil?Scenes of the city are just breathtaking, and fighting and shootout scenes are like a ballet. ScaJo's suit and body, is an image i will remember till the day i die, And all other actors and characters are valid replicas of anime original characters, and very well done. One of the most important pluses of the movie for me, is the camera job. Finally for the love god, we do not get Shaky cam, instead we get most sharp and clear action scenes since matrix. Choreography of fights and using guns is done so well, that you get goosebumps.I appreciate it so much , because i always felt eye raped, with action scenes in last 10-15 years.They are all horrible, and not one is memorable.The story is not weak or dumbed down, as anime fans are saying it. It is actually completely the same, and all important points and messages , are spoken out in the movie, and there are some very emotive scenes. There are also some very cool and unforgettable lines in the movie, like for example: ""You never send a rabbit to kill a fox"" That reminded of the substance and style movies of the 90's had, which were super sharp and memorable punchlines, or jokes.I just can not praise this movies enough. It was the most profound ,beautiful and memorable movie experience i had since Matrix. Please ignore the fake fans , who only jumped the bandwagon for no reason at all.

This is yet another role where she jumps around and acts dumb and she is beginning typecast herself with superhero /sci-fi roles. I would love to see her do something with a little substance, . Ghost in the Shell is set in the future in which humans and technology have begun to merge, a cybernetically enhanced soldier hunts a mysterious terrorist who can hack into his victims' minds and control their thoughts and memories. Her pursuit eventually leads her to discover the full truth about her past.I wasn't surprised to read Ghost in the Shell was adapted from a Japanese Manga series from the 80's as it has that fantastical feel about it. Fantastical not fantastic. It also has the feel of a video game which is perhaps why it didn't do too much for me. The first 45 minutes bored me silly but thankfully the last hour was much better. Good special affects and fine performance from underrated actor Pilou Asbæk still won't have me queuing up for any more in what is quite obviously going to be a new franchise.","11 out of 30 found this helpful.

It's not a bad film. Standing alone it's an OK action/sci-fi film. As a live action recreation of the GITS universe it falls flat. Why? 1. It somewhat misses (or ignores) the point of the original Ghost in the Shell even though the term is used in the film. 2. It has none of the rich backstory of the universe in which GITS exists. With all the material which has gone before a better picture could have been painted of this future world and how it got to be what it is. 3. The Section 9 team were not a team. The banter and humanity of the section was lost in the glare of the spotlight on The Majors story. Motivations were also unclear partly because of the lack of backstory.A cynical view says the story may have suffered from being dumb-ed down and then being passed through an internationalising process to remove anything which could potentially have caused offence.Being optimistic there is so much material from the original stories that there is opportunity to correct the errors in the sequels.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

This time we review the latest comic book inspired film ghost in a shell starring leading lady Scarlett Johansson as an ""epic"" cybernetic cop trying to stop terrorism. With a large cult following, this movie certainly has a lot to live up to in terms of quality, and if you're not familiar with the series than you are probably hoping action. What is the verdict? Please read on to hear my thoughts on the latest film. LIKES:  Decent Sci-Fi Plot  Cool visuals  Nice character design  Okay actingSummary: I'll lay it out now, I haven't read nor seen any ghost in the shell media, so I can't justify how it matches. However, from a movie perspective, this film has a decent Sci-Fi plot that fits into the genre where anything can happen. A dark plot about cybernetics, Ghost in The Shell again diverts from the fantasy train, and takes a more realistic (albeit theatrical) turn into science territory of humans becoming robots. The more realistic plot is not much of a stretch and provides an ample medium to create awesome visuals to sell that realism. And that, my friends, is the best part of this movie. Ghost in the Shell's visuals are impressive, overlaying futuristic advertising onto a real life setting that doesn't look cheesy. In all honesty, it is like taking a look at what Japan can look like in the future and how our desire to ""progress"" can ruin it. Outside the city look, the characters themselves look like something out of a comic, each with a flare that scream Japanese animation. While some looks are certainly worth a chuckle, a few characters like Major (Johansson) and Kuze (Michael Pitt) are well developed, looking sleek, deadly, or horrifying and standing out in terms of the realistic design you are seeking. But while visuals are impressive, you also hope the actors can bring their characters to life in a way that will meet expectations. Happy to say, the cast did a decent job in their goal, though again I'm uncertain how the characters are supposed to act having not read the comic. If Major is supposed to be very monotone and hardly reactive, Johansson nails that approach, hardly diluting from the calm, stoic battle mode of the robotic assassin. Pitt having to act like a tortured (albeit enlightened) terrorist wins points for gruesome tactics, prolonged speeches, and many other things that a cyberterrorist is expected to have. The rest of the cast is decent, but we have limited space and more to cover, so let's wrap and say the rest aren't bad given their little screen time. DISLIKES:  Little involvement with other characters  Plot is very predictable and dragged out  Action is sub-par most of the timeSummary: My dislikes start with the lack of involvement in other characters. Johansson carries most of the film as major, taking much of the screen time and stunts this movie requires. Her team ""helps"" out at certain points, and her director certainly gets some good jabs in, but overall the other characters are almost pointless. For being an elite team, Section 9's agents did little to impress me and that team approach could have amped up the movie. This is especially true given how lackluster the plot was. While realistic, Ghost In A Shell has little in terms of uniqueness to justify the nearly two hour run time. Even if you haven't read the books, the ending can be seen from a mile away and the delivery wasn't spectacular enough to wait for (at least for me). The dramatic flare and character development are certainly nice, don't get me wrong on that, but the ""exciting"" climax I was waiting for just wasn't there. This brings me to the action component. Ghost In the Shell was promoted as action packed and exciting, but for me it was mediocre at best. A nice Matrix style opening shows promise for the movie, but it doesn't take long for the stunts to be diluted to quick, unimpressive bouts that last mere minutes (if not seconds). There is little challenge to the fights, and little technology used, which is disappointing given the movie is all about technology. And after all the waiting you would think an epic fight at the end, but no, it's just Johansson running from CGI bullets until a very dramatic finish occurs. This boring display of technology just made the nearly 2 hour run time seem worthless, given the promise the trailers made. The VERDICT:Ghost In The Shell is a visual display that certainly representative of its comic book origins. Unfortunately, outside of these impressive visual displays, the rest of the movie doesn't live up to what I expected from the trailers. The story is mediocre and the execution is flawed, to promote a boring mess with only character development as its redeeming grace. Despite the impressive design of the movie, this reviewer does not recommend this one for the theater, unless you go in with low expectations. Instead hold out for home rental and instead read the comic book it is based on. My scores are:Action/Crime/Drama: 6.5 Movie Overall: 6.0","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

This may reflect a departure from, and simplification of, the original story, which was in part an exploration of existential philosophy. That aside, the 2017 live-action version of the story is visually stunning, with excellent character makeup/prosthetics and hardware (e.g. the 'spidertank""), although I found endless holographically-enhanced cityscape motif to be repetitive and not very 'realistic' (in the 'probable' sense of the term). When brewed down, there is not much of a story and the characters don't have a lot to do other than be predictable. Scarlett Johansson was fine playing her usual jump-suited super hero shtick but, while I don't really care about the PC 'white washing' critiques, the film would have been a little more coherent if the character had been played by a Japanese actress (of course, the character is a synthetic person and could look like anyone, but, again of course, this being Hollywood, is going to be slim and photogenic).

At some points it felt like the skyscrapers had skyscrapers on them! This is where the majority of the 6stars go.But there seems to be loads of other sci-fi influences chucked in there too. In the original 1995 film I don't remember any of these holographic overlays on the dystopian cityscape. Maybe they featured in the GitS TV series but for me it had much more Blade Runner DNA in it. The whole film felt a lot more Neo Noir than the original ever did. One scene (entrance to the Hanka building) felt like it was straight out of Robocop. Another had all of these swishing lights and very similar noise to a light sabre. Were they all influences on Masamune Shirow or just chucked in for a bit of Hollywood ""depth""?Where the film really let itself down was that it fundamentally rewrote the film. In the original it is cyborg and human vs AI. In this version it's cyborg & human vs cyborg. This diminishes the whole philosophical content and distorts the context. May be I'm being pedantic but the movie is weakened when you change the story line, from an AI who wants to experience mortality and procreation to one of a Cyborg love interest.My final gripe is the ending. In the original it is one of the most interesting and thought provoking scenes. The remake features most of it but misses out on the best part of the scene; the Spider Tank shooting up the dinosaur fossils and a stone masonry tree of life. Stopping just shot of the highest branch (Hominis). It's this lack of richness where the film lets itself down. Of course a lot of the changes will be so that they can Make a trilogy out of the universe and do a spin off trilogy for Badou too. #ihatemycynicism still worthy of a watch I guess but don't build up your expectations.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

With that said, I went into this movie with an open mind hoping that it would not be bad and adds to love for the series and my collections. I glanced at my GITS DVDs as I left the house excited for the possibility. I really wanted this film to surprise me, but did not want it deviate from an already exciting and innovative plot too far. It failed to achieve that however. What I saw was a shoddy story, a lack of understanding regarding the morality of GIIS, a lot of impressive graphics and an actress who does not belong, is of the wrong ethnicity and really does not know what the original story of the film she is in is about. For her, it is a pay check. The music, in particular was disappointing and fails. I honestly can't think of any redeeming qualities that this film has other than as a showcase of how soulless impressive CGIs could be. . hopefully the Japanese will continue the series on their own.","44 out of 115 found this helpful.

"10","/10","A worthy variation on The Ghost in the Shell by Masamune Shirow","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3800547/?ref_=tt_urv","aripyanfar","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur41206778/?ref_=tt_urv","8 September 2017","The original manga is an outstanding graphic novel. This is a worthy variation of that high standard story. I considered taking off one star just for the script of the last voice-over. I don't think the philosophy of the story boils down to so simple idea of what defines humanity. However, since such a range of ideas about what makes a human human, and what the division of human and machine is came up in the movie already, I didn't think I could penalize it a whole star. At its best the movie captures the grandeur of Shirow's visual compositions. It also retains in variation some of the most iconic action sequences, which is extremely satisfying. After all, in so many ways this is an action movie. The comedic interludes are ditched, but that's fair enough for the story telling space of one movie. The drama and tension remain high. The soft-core porn treatment of the Major's body is kept, and this is neither accidental or unnecessary. The choice of a body that is easy to sexually objectify is critical in a story that is examining the boundaries between subjects and objects. The boundaries between conscious and non-conscious entities. The boundaries of consent and non consent when the subject does not know what they are consenting to. The boundaries between medical-procedures-to-save sentients and machine-upgrades for owned objects. The antagonist and the progress of the plot is changed considerably. It could have been a disaster, and no doubt some fans of the existent story will consider it a disaster. However, I think the producers absolutely kept the most important part of the story intact. That is the philosophical musings of the story. Where the story fails as a pure action movie, it does because its climax is bent on throwing out at least two dozen philosophical questions, instead of two dozen explosions. If you don't go through at least a mini existential crisis after having ideas in the movie bubble back up in your mind, then that's perhaps because you don't have the same time to stop and absorb the ramifications of ideas in the movie the way you get to pause over the written story. The written story also had the luxury of sinking into the idea of the evolution of consciousness in the way that the movie doesn't and couldn't, without pausing the action and having a 30 minute dialogue. The script of this movie gives a great shot at throwing Shirow's questions into audience minds without pausing the action, and by delivering them through a changed plot that is perhaps more easy to relate to than the disembodied character(s) of the original.I was extremely happy with this GITS variation.","60 out of 68 found this helpful.

This is an action film at its heart and it does work on this level. I know many have been critical of the watering down of the concept(s) found in the Manga series but considering this is only a 106 minute film I'd say personally, its hard to capture the depth to be found in the comic books. Action wise there's a lot to like here. Its well paced if not frenetic and the action sequences have a polish that brings this imagined world to life nicely. In terms of story, I do feel a little more time spent on characterization would have fleshed out out this film. In particular, a little more focus on how the key characters past life impacts on her. Her realizations of who she is, lack emotion and are all too brief. My advice don't come to this film expecting what you find in the books. This is in action film and in a functional kind of way as I said, it does work. I do agree it could have done more but it is constrained by time limitations and I would imagine financial ones too. Seven out of ten from me.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Putting Pilou Asbæk next to her was twice the punishment! The whole Hollywood type casting thing drags down movies.Second was the storyline and the writing. It was seriously lacking. A. you knew what was coming before it ever came. B. trying to hide the lack of good dialog behind action scenes only goes so far. This whole movie lacked any substantial dialog at all. They were throwing scenes in the movie that were frankly pointless because they couldn't write anything meaningful. Even the last battle scene was just lame. They wrote so poorly they even left cliff hangers in segments where there should have been action. I wouldn't spend a dime to go see this movie and I'm glad I watched it online because of that.110 million and this is the garbage they threw out. it wasn't even 1/2 as good as Lucy, not that Lucy was some epicly great movie.

Plus, if the creator of the original anime movie literally said he's completely okay with Major being portrayed by an American actress then people really shouldn't be complaining. There are some themes in the film that in my opinion the film handles better than in the anime, and some themes that they don't handle as well. The movie is absolutely gorgeous to look at, it's basically a one to one perfect live action rendition of the anime world of Ghost in the Shell.Overall, this movie has some flaws, but it's very good nonetheless.

This live action adaptation expands the run time and trims majority of the original's needless political dialogue but it sadly misses 'the point' of the original anime.Upon initially watching this film, I felt it deserved around an 8/10 as the cinematography, music and overall production of the movie is really high and it's great from this prospective. Scarlett Johansson also does a great job as Major (despite not being Asian and the backlash she received from the role) and the rest of the acting is pretty good here and the action is solid as well; solid translation to live action in these departments.In terms of plot, however, upon reflection I felt Ghost in The Shell suffers in that it re-writes core elements of the original story which doesn't come together as well in my opinion - some of the character expansion featured is appreciated but some of the film really doesn't adapt some of the stronger philosophical elements of the original and this was a large part of its popularity. The original anime had some deep, subtle moments and it feels as if this was thrown away for a more personal story but it doesn't feel satisfying. The final act should've followed the original material much closer.In my opinion, watch the original for a better story adaptation but do give this live action version a watch even just for the music and visuals as they are really good!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Masamune Shirow, Jamie Moss, William Wheeler, Ehren Kruger really had their work cut out for them when they all wrote the story as it was shot in the movie, each of them working independently. I am not here to give any spoilers so I will just try and keep to the original content. The movie is excellent, the actors really portrayed their characters well. Scarlett Johanson really did well and all the other actors really made me believe I was watching the original of so long ago. The CGI is just as good and I could easily believe what was produced was truth and not CGI. To comment on the story itself: (without giving spoilers) there was some things left out from the original content, which would have been nice to see if it was there, (but it didn't take anything away from the storyline).The different story-lines, time-lines and content of the originals had way to many things that clashed and it is nice to see the way that the movie was produced, was where a lot of detail was actually left murky and that gave the story a chance to flow into each other. The movie also had a proper intro, body and ending, which left me as the watcher feeling complete. So this movie is a complete movie and could be left as is, but it also built a platform, so that more movies or story-lines could flow from here...

If it weren't for the fact that I'm a huge fan of the cyberpunk aesthetic, I probably would've found this film to be even more devoid of meaning. While it is technically speaking great, and while it manages to capture the cyberpunk feel perfectly (at least as far as I'm concerned), the story and the characters feel utterly shallow.Now, I should note that this was my first touch into the Ghost in the Shell franchise. I have never read the manga or seen any of the animated films, so it is entirely possible that those versions offer the depth that I found myself searching for. In fact, having heard nothing but great things about the original animated film, that probably is the case.
Bringing the focus back to this particular film, I want to start with the good things, as I did feel like there were quite a few of them.
First of all, as I already mentioned, this film was technically speaking great. Although the dystopian cyber infused world did often feel a bit empty, the way it captured the gloomy neon-filled cityscape, more than made up for it. I have always been a fan of the cyberpunk aesthetic, and everything that comes with it, and I certainly found myself often enamoured by what I was seeing on screen.
Another aspect that I quite appreciated, was how good everything looked. There are plenty of moments that are filled with 'futuristic' effects and beings, and everything looked great. For a film like Ghost in the Shell, it is, of course, crucial that that be the case, as the only way it will ever make any impact, is by making the viewer believe in the world that it is building.With all that being said, the unfortunate reality still remains, that this film just isn't particularly good. Its greatest downfall comes in its inability to leave an impact. The story, while seemingly filled with great ideas and questions that challenge us to think about humanity and its infatuation with technology, never quite manages to bring forth those ideas in an impactful manner. This could, again, be different in the manga or the animated film, but as far as this live-action version is concerned, I found myself yearning for more. What astonishes me is the relatively short run-time. Especially nowadays, when movies with a run-time of over two hours are commonplace, I would've thought that a film that clearly has so much to say, would've reached at least those two hours. In fact, I can't come up with any other reason as to why this is than the fact that the focus was so heavily on worldbuilding, that everything else was forgotten about. Indeed, despite its short run-time, there are plenty of scenes that add nothing else to the film, but something nice to look at. These moments, which could've been used for building up the characters and thus making the final moments that much more impactful, are, instead, used for what can only be described as eye-candy.More than anything, I'm disappointed by Ghost in the Shell. Going in, knowing nothing about the story or the world, I was intrigued from the very get-go. However, as I quickly realized, this film wasn't what it at first seemed to be. By throwing aside the deeper conversation about the themes that are relevant throughout, it managed to be nothing more than average. In fact, I assume that I liked this film more than I should have, simply because I cherished the world it built around its story.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The city-scape scenes, with the cameras soaring over the top of the downtown area make my jaw drop. Its just stunning. All the sets are gorgeous and all the character visuals are just beautiful. I mean we could have done without the stupid amount of scenes with ScarJo wearing little else than a skin coloured body suit thing. I mean she wasn't naked, but she may have well of been. The airbrushed look to her face was also a little unsettling but I guess it was done to make her look a little more inhuman that the others, to mark her as something other.Plot wise, there isn't a lot of plot. It's a pretty basic premise, uses a lot of plot points from your average soy thriller and places them in a futuristic setting. It was interesting enough, but it was completely predictable and nothing that happened was really all that shocking. So if you are looking for something that you haven't experienced before, this wont be for you, but if you want some fairly interesting sci-fi then you will be entertained for and hour and a half.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It has a fantastic looking exterior with a hollow interior. The film looks impeccable. All the production design is incredible looking. I don't know how much was adapted straight from the anime, and what is original to the movie, but it all looked fantastic. Everything from the costumes to the city shots of futuristic Japan was just incredible to watch. The problem with this movie is that, while the visuals are all fantastic, it's absolutely hollow on the inside. There is nothing below the surface for this movie. It doesn't have any real emotion, nor does it deliver on any kind of profound philosophical ideas. It's just boring and bland. Every now and then there are some cool action scenes, but they are so fleeting and scarce that they don't accommodate for the rest of the movie.","12 out of 26 found this helpful.

Only the 8th in the world actually for such a laser system and the only in New England. Don't get me started on the amazing sound. So let me tell you, I realized I loved this film. A fan of the original series and anime myself, I have come to appreciate the process that they went to try and tell the story in a live version. In fact, much of the mid-90's original anime movie story-line is presented here. While the film might not be perfect, I felt when I left the movie, that I enjoyed it tremendously and that I felt my money was well spent. A good investment in time and money...and certainly something to talk about over dinner.What else could you ask for? :)J.

In my opinion, this was a thoroughly entertaining sci-fi action movie. The overall mood is really dark and gritty, thanks to an exceptional production and costume design. The VFX and CGI was well made, didn't feel as cheap or overdone as we often see in this genre. The score was satisfyingly powerful, kinda reminiscent of Tron: Legacy. I liked the cast, especially some lesser known actors. Scarlett's performance was typical. Good, but nothing out of the ordinary. By far the best thing about this movie is the cinematography. I can't say enough about how exceptionally well shot this was. This movie is such a pleasure to look at. The framing, the camera movement, color grading and the use of light are all top notch. Simply stunning visuals! Yes, this had the potential to be so much more, but I still wouldn't call it a disappointment like some other reviewers have. If it wasn't for the mysterious, yet somewhat shallow and uninventive plot I'd give it an 8 or 9. I loved the visuals that much.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The Story: For those unfamiliar with the 1995 anime film Ghost in the Shell fear not, the story is well paced and easy to understand for newcomers and for fans this was a very special experience as the story has a new but at the same time familiar feeling that makes you say This is Ghost in the Shell.Art: The futuristic world portrayed in this film is absolutely beautiful to look at, the CGI is so good that sometimes I forgot it was CGI, in my opinion they represented the world of Ghost in the Shell perfectly.I was very happy with Scarlett Johansson performance in this film, she became the major and did an amazing job at it, not only is she beautiful but very talented to make one of the most well known characters in the history of the anime industry her own.If you still have doubts about going to the movie theater to see this movie, please do yourself a favor and go watch it now you will not regret it.

I hated the fact that this movie used CGI to create scenery that tried (very unsuccessfully) to emulate ""Blade Runner."" The movie also tried unsuccessfully to borrow elements from ""Max Headroom,"" ""Wolverine,"" and ""RoboCop."" So here we have a modern day movie that does not meet the aesthetic and thematic standards of movies decades past. Blade Runner had grit not antiseptic CGI with mangled shots of Hong Kong. If you have ever been to Hong Kong you will immediately know that Ghost in the Shell was shot in Hong Kong. Why then would Japanese people (and cheeky and cheesy cyborgs alike) be living in and dominating the street of Hong Kong. As to cyborgs, why not 3d print a plastic jawbone or Victorian clockwork eye sockets of your own. That is how cheesy the non-cgi effects were. Why would a modern day robot have steam-punk eye sockets? Why?This movie had phony special effects but lacked any kind of social commentary or science fiction story whatsoever. Death Race 2050 lacked special effects but had a totally incredible level of social commentary that used a science fiction story to talk about current issues. Death Race 2050 made people uncomfortable, it hit home.If you want science fiction your best bet is to watch TV. ""The Expanse,"" talked about the fragility of human designed (and thus simplified) complex systems. A show with no budget, and minimal special effects, hit upon an issue that great thinkers such as James Lovelock have identified as being a very important part of our future. Ghost in the Shell is not science fiction, its milieu is cheesy and unbelievable, the action is flat, does not talk to the ethics of technology, and the action sucks. Perhaps sensibilities of Chinese production companies has killed yet another movie. When I see Chinese production companies take credit for a movie I about to see I shudder.","17 out of 41 found this helpful.

I expected stunning 3D cinematics and so on and so on. Basically the bar was set way too high, as this is one of the two super-cult mangas of the 90s (the first one being ""Akira"" 1988).Well, in short - the movie is great! Worth every cent seeing it on a big screen.Now in detail - I probably had to first see again the original, so I could compare them, but I didn't. Maybe for good, as I watched the movie without way too much expectations and honestly enjoyed it. Stunning visuals - yes, great music - yes, great play - yes, Takeshi Kitano - YES, YES, YESSS!! (Who does not love Beat Takeshi?? :) Yes - and Scarlett Johansson. Well, she's great too, but can't beat the Beat ;)The only two things I do remember from the original are the first scene and the last scene, and these two do match, as of my memories. The other thing is the music - the hypnotic vocal theme. The music of the current version is great, but no match. It's just different. However, they included the original theme as well, just it's in the end credits.The only problem with this movie is the IMAX version - honestly, it does not worth the price of the IMAX ticket. Just there is nothing really worth seeing in the IMAX version! Yes of course - great picture quality, but hey I go to IMAX for stunning 3D visuals, not just great picture quality and ""Ghost in the Shell"" 2017 version is simply not enough 3D-enhanced for IMAX, so don't bother yourself going in there, unless you are just a fan of IMAX. In the last 5 years there was just one movie not created for IMAX, but really stunningly 3D-enhanced for IMAX and that was ""Dr.Strange"" 2016. No other movie IMAX version really got me so much, as ""Dr.Strange"" for IMAX. ""Ghost in the Shell"" 2017 looks great on IMAX, but not so great to worth the money for. At least my opinion.Oh and one more thing I didn't liked - no post-credits scene. Not that the original had one I remember of, but just letting you know there is nothing to wait the end of the credits for, unless you are one of these fans who wants to read the small notes.Good thing is - they mentioned that the soundtrack is going to get released, so check it out! It is not as stunning as Daft Punk's music for the second ""Tron"", neither ""Stranger Things"", but still it's great. I would give it like 8/10.So final words - go see it!

The visual effects were good. Straight out of the manga (and Anime) it was based on.So there is a bit of controversy about Scarlett Johansson as the lead. Me personally, I just don't click with Johansson as a movie star. Would think that a hot chick would make me run to the movie theater, but she does not do it for me.It's a step up form a movie like Avatar which like Ghost in the Shell had visuals that were mind blowing but a so so story. The Manga was not the greatest story to comprehend and this adaption does a lackluster job of trying to fix that.You can blame Johansson for that as it was important to focus on the movie star therefore expanding the lead characters background story beyond that of the comic book, and adding the stuff that explains why a white woman is playing an Asian charter.So not that impressive of a movie, but definitely not bad too watch, literally. I can't think of another live-action anime adaption that was done better.http://cinemagardens.com","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

"6","/10","""Blade Runner"" + ""RoboCop"" + ""The Matrix"" = ""Ghost in the Shell"" 2017","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3674852/?ref_=tt_urv","dee.reid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0892646/?ref_=tt_urv","31 March 2017","In many ways, ""Ghost in the Shell,"" the 2017 live-action film adaptation of the Japanese Manga series of the same name by Shirow Masamune, represents how the film industry has come full circle.Mamoru Oshii directed the original 1995 Anime' ""Ghost in the Shell,"" which was one of the earliest Anime' films I ever saw as a teenager in high school and is one of my all-time favorite films ever, and one of my all-time favorite science fiction films. The Wachowskis cited ""Ghost in the Shell"" as one of the key cinematic and visual influences on ""The Matrix"" (1999). And we all know ""The Matrix,"" with its groundbreaking, time-bending ""bullet time"" effects, would influence many action films afterward.(Is it also a coincidence that today marks the 18th anniversary of ""The Matrix""?)And now ""Ghost in the Shell"" has been released, which employs many of the same slow-motion special effects that ""The Matrix"" pioneered. It only seems natural that the source material would return the favor in some way. That, and the obvious cyber-punk visual influences borrowed from Anime', William Gibson's 1984 novel ""Neuromancer,"" and also Ridley Scott's landmark sci-fi picture ""Blade Runner"" (1982) are about the only things really worth mentioning here.Like many others, I was concerned with the obvious Hollywood white-washing of a uniquely Japanese film and Manga property. Rupert Sanders's take on ""Ghost in the Shell"" tries to remedy those concerns by having a multi-national cast of actors - some of whom are Japanese themselves (but are still short-changed for screen-time, anyway) - playing characters who were originally ALL Japanese. The biggest sin of all, of course, was the casting of Scarlett Johansson as Major Motoko Kusanagi.To be fair, and as I've commented many times in the past when news of this film first broke, Scarlett Johansson's career has probably led up to this point. After her roles in ""Lucy"" (2014) and as The Black Widow in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, ""Ghost in the Shell"" seemed like the next logical career step for her. In fact, I kept thinking throughout this film how her portrayal of Major Motoko Kusanagi was just a cyber-punk-influenced variation of her role AS The Black Widow from the MCU, complete with dazzling, ""Matrix""-inspired gun-play and martial arts action sequences.(And as I've ALSO stated plenty of times before, they should have gotten actress Rinko Kikuchi, who IS Japanese, to play the Japanese Major Motoko Kusanagi, but alas.)It's a shame, because ""Ghost in the Shell"" did have the potential to be something good. Of course in translating Masamune's work to English-speaking American audiences, some things inevitably get lost in the translation. For instance, the original 1995 film was a great philosophical and quasi-religious meditation on the human soul and the meaning of individual identity and the impact that rapidly advancing technology has on either one, as well as the integration of computers and ""'Net"" into nearly every aspect of society. This film does make some odd references to the role memories play in forming individual identity (one's ""ghost,"" if you will), but it gets muddled by a spotty script and performances, and weak simplifications of Oshii's ideas for the American mainstream.""Ghost in the Shell"" 2017 follows very closely to the 1995 Anime', and also borrows a few ideas from the TV series ""Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex"" (which I also love, and the film's opening action sequence reproduces the opening moments from the first-season episode). Another of the only things it does retain is the profound seriousness of the 1995 Anime' film, and none of the humor that was present in the original Manga series.Using a story set-up that will strike fans of the American sci-fi satire ""RoboCop"" (1987) as oddly familiar, Johansson plays the ""Major Mira Killian,"" instead of Major Motoko Kusanagi, who as a child was badly injured in a terrorist attack and whose brain was then placed in a cyborg body, the first of its kind. (The film also treats us to an opening credits sequence that's reminiscent of the opening credits of Oshii's film.) A year later, she is with Public Security Section 9 as their top operative. She's investigating a series of ghost-hacking incidents that are being perpetrated by a master computer hacker named Kuze (Michael Carmen Pitt), who is somehow connected to Killian's past. Together with her cyborg partner Batou (Pilou Asbæk) and her supervisor Aramaki (""Beat"" Takeshi Kitano), they go about trying to track him down and bring him to justice.Fans of the original 1995 ""Ghost in the Shell"" or Shirow Masamune's Manga may be sorely disappointed with Rupert Sanders's take on the material. The film looks dazzling; it's a perfectly realized live-action cyber-punk fantasy inspired by the not-so-futuristic visuals of ""Blade Runner"" and action scenes that seem like something out of ""The Matrix."" But die-hards may have a hard time buying Scarlett Johansson as the Major, and just may see her playing another version of The Black Widow - or hell, even Lucy. She can deliver the goods in the action sequences, but when it comes time to meditating on her cybernetic existence - like her Japanese Anime' counterparts were prone to doing on their downtime - she's kind of a bore and quite wooden.""Beat"" Takeshi Kitano, a legendary figure in Japan, is the only other real stand-out here. As the paternal father figure in the Major's life, he speaks all of his lines in his native Japanese tongue (though the filmmakers could have forced him to speak English, which I know he can) - which is about one of the most authentic things about his performance, and the film, period.In short, I would suggest seeing ""Ghost in the Shell"" 2017 just once to satisfy your curiosity and to say that you've seen it. And then you can go back and re-watch Mamoru Oshii's masterpiece or re-read Shirow Masamune's original Manga series.6/10","8 out of 22 found this helpful.

While I understand that Johanssen's character is supposed to be a robotic body housing a human mind, it really irritates that she moves her body as if trying to look robotic. Gait mechanics are much less complex than neural interfaces - if you can make a robot that looks human, and interface an actual human brain, you can't make one that walks normally? Pass. The graphics were well done, the CG was great, and the effects were pretty good, but the acting and the backstory were a loss.

Of course, if you compare the movie to the original Anime, it's hard to deny that it's just a vague shadow of the original source and idea. But if you see it as it's own movie you will be entertained with stunning visuals and nice action, so it deserves at least 6 points for ""effort"". Now to the downside of the movie if you want to actually compare it. It feels like the children's book version of the Anime. EVERYTHING has to be explained, nothing keeps unsaid for your own imagination. Ghost in the Shell was about the question what makes us human, what is life. But not in this way this movies tries to tell us. If life can give birth itself out of data, how can we define it? This movie sadly skips this part and the main question is ""who was I before I became a robot?"". Dear film makes, no one cares! It misses all the depth what made the original so special. The slow scenes to think, to create atmosphere... Like so many others already said; it's more of a reboot of RoboCop than it's of Ghost in the Shell.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

And after that on visuals, sound, design, performance, etc. It is surely a mix of them all, but the essence is and will always be to relay an important set of messages through an impressive story. And this is the reason why improvisation will always be a milestone in creating good movies. Because repetitiveness is always going to go into oblivion.For example ""Ghost in the shell"" - the anime movie from 1995 will always be this cornerstone in the lives of many young before and now not so young people. It is an essential part of my life too. And I can't just pass on seeing what Rupert Sanders has done with these incredible set of characters, with this great set of ideas and story. You see, people get inspired by stories which tell them something new to them, which teach them something they don't know about themselves and about the surrounding world. And at the same time these valuable fiction pieces show that we've had this valuable information in ourselves all the time. We just had to dig deep and find it. To acknowledge it. To accept its existence and then to use it in our lives. To be better people, to live a happier and more fulfilling life. This is the kind of art piece the original ""Ghost in the shell"" is. At least to me. So it's important to stress out what a big task this director took.Now, I want to say that I truly believe that cinema is an eternal form of creation because it refreshes itself by inspiring the film community within. This anime is a beautiful example for this. I cannot give a better example for film inspired by GitS than ""The Matrix"". There we see a seamless transition of groundbreaking ideas from one form (mind) to another. This is the living tissue of cinema itself. Ideas about information flow, purpose of life in cybernetic society, gender identity and the future of the human soul flourish from anime to movie life the first breath of a new born baby! And this is exactly what I love.So seeing the new Scarlett Johansson's new movie was a test. An awaited test, but still a test. And it performed more or less as expected. The story was dummed down A LOT. I don't even want to speak about it. It was interesting to see the script writers discussing a fresh look into Motoko Kusanagi's origins, but this idea seemed not thought in details enough. The performances of the actors weren't bad. But the characters are part of the flawed story. So yeah - it wasn't a very good movie.But it was a decent one, because...they did hire some of the best design, music and graphic artists available on the market. And the atmosphere, sound, costumes, CG were GREAT! It sure looks expensive, but it is for a reason. I really enjoyed what WETA did in this movie. These people put up so much effort into interpreting and creating from the original content, that I want to recommend watching the movie if not for something else, than just for their work. It is worthy of appraisal. And let's not forget Hong Kong...the main landscape which inspired the original is seen in this movie as well. A future city it still is!So overall I would like to ask you all - do you prefer to have a shiny shell or a thoughtful ghost? I personally prefer to have both!","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

Even though I saw it on a plane, I was extremely impressed with how well they recreated a lot of the scenes. The atmosphere of the world was amazing, and surreal. I thought Scarlett Johansson did an amazing job!! She didn't need to look or be Japanese. In the anime, she looks completely different from everyone else. They make her look ""doll like"" to differentiate from being human. It works well. For anyone that's seen the original anime, I would really recommend it. There isn't anything I can say that makes me think it should receive anything less than a 10.

Judge Dredd or Demolition Man come to mind, especially as both are as badly cast and acted as GitS. Let's address the universally praised visuals first. The film technically looks nice but none of it will stick with you due to the exceptionally bland setting. Seriously, where is this film set? The best looking bits also ape the source material nearly 1 to 1. Van Sant's Psycho ""remake"" comes to mind... Well done VFX crew but your hard work was sadly wasted. I am also not sure if the films even has music, a hallmark of GitS, but you occasionally get to hear 10 second bits by a choir with no rhyme or reason. Sigh. On to the cast.Kitano mostly sits on a chair and looks sleepy, Asbæk completely gets Batou (my favorite anime character) wrong and I will come to Johansson later. Let's stick with Batou and only the 2 generic villains gets something to do too. The writer apparently though that the audience is too dumb to understand the concept of his iconic cybernetic eyes, so the film gives a bewildering origin story for them. That's how dumb and random the script is. It also includes the term ""lawless zone""! What this films doesn't have time for is to explain basic GitS terminology, while other elements are over explained to an unreasonable degree. The film also takes scenes and plot points from both anime films, and both TV seasons of SAC, despite the two having vastly different continuities. Act 1 and 2 are thus best described as GitS for the mentally impaired and squeamish, as the PG-13 proves about as unsuited as everyone expected. Many scenes even randomly stop and the film is badly edited too. To a degree that it becomes hard to make out what happens! On to act 3 and the protagonist.Johansson can act, just not in this film. She is less sleepy than Kitano but one of the strongest female characters in ALL of anime was reduced to a borderline incompetent combatant and most importantly a doe eyed idiot. All of this is ""technically"" supported by the predictable twist ending but it proves to be the worst bit of the film by FAR. Don't get me wrong. The first 100-ish minutes bored and irritated me but we are talking about a 4/10, not a 1/10. Yes, act 3 is THAT bad. Would you like it if a Batman film ended with the protagonist turning out to be a random teenager from the other side of the world? Something similar basically happens here. Motoko's military career and much more, a unifier for all GitS canons, just get taken away. WTF and the film flat out stops to ""excuse"" the (somewhat justified) whitewashing allegations by creating a vaguely racist black hole of bad ideas that can only appeal to someone who hates the source material or can't be bothered to think during a CG film. The only thing missing is romance sub-plot. No one in the film is capable of human emotions, so we dogged 2 bullets here. The films thus ends up being much worse than I ever expected and is best described as the ""new"" Fan4stic or Dragon Ball Evolution for comic films. Don't watch it if you ever cared about any of the anime versions and watch those instead if you never did! All 3 canons are great. This though ain't cyberpunk, it's cybertrash. The newly announced GitS anime (how convenient...) and hopefully Blade Runner 2 now need to ""save"" the cyberpunk sub-genre, while the promising Alita: Battle Angel will have to do the same for US / Life Action anime. Good luck Mr. Rodriguez!","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

Very Asian oriented, perhaps that didn't appeal to me as much. I tried to like it. Also, I found the love interest, curiousness, confusing!","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Though the beginning was a little difficult to understand but it all tied in and made sense throughout the events of the movie. I loved the action sequences and special effects! Many people say that casting Scarlet Johansson a Japanese film was white-washing, but I thought that this was great! The main character (Major) is supposed to be a robot of someone else from the past so it does not matter if she is white or Asian. Scarlet Johansson's performance was phenomenal and I really did enjoy this film!","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

There's a few but, there certainly aren't enough intelligent portrayals of the inner lives of robots and those that are robotically enhanced.The next best example I can think of is Blade Runner. But whereas Blade Runner (adapted from a novel) is told from a very human point of view, Ghost in the Shell takes you so much deeper in to the world of cyborgs that you forget what human is, and you are lost in Masamune Shirow's (the manga writer) very possible future.As a fan of the anime as well, I also enjoyed the subtleties that showed up in little places like Scarlett Johansson's posture, perfectly done.I am certainly surprised by the general critical response. As other reviewers have noted, this is a little scary because other brilliant, insightful and just plain different Japanese science fiction stories need to be retold for the big screen and for Western audiences and for me. As it is, with Ghost in the Shell not making big returns at the box office, we are doomed to keep getting mind numbing predictable crap (Terminator vs. Transformers 7). There are just far to many good ideas that Hollywood passes by. But movies are a risky business, and if no one wants to go see the good ones, the same old crap will get the funding.My biggest regret of the year is that I did not see Ghost in the Shell in the theater, in 3D. I listened to a friend who said it wasn't good. After seeing the movie on DVD, I re-asked the same friend what he didn't like and found that he didn't really know ~ something about Scarlett Johansson not being Japanese enough. Sheesh.Oh well, Blade Runner got lots of boos when it first came out too. I guess it's challenging to be ahead of one's time.","40 out of 45 found this helpful.

A good remake should never aim to ""replace"" the original and GitS thankfully doesn't. Theatre lives by this tradition for centuries. How to get it right? In theatre modern interpretations often look for the substance, the core of a play, and apply it to the present realities. In consequence even clear cut plots get more and more abstracted. Ghost in the Shell does it the other way around: the rather philosophical original, partly hard to digest not least for western viewers drama wise, gets an ""emotional upgrade"" in a more personalized and thus more relatable plot. To put it bluntly: the different forces at work all have a face representing them. At least as far as western film language goes it does work as an improvement as a cinema experience and renders it more accessible, more pointed. It is however sacrificing abstraction as it is precisely the absence of the person in favor of the ghost (one could say ""soul"") the original deals with. Mind ""person"" originally means ""mask"", as in the (role defining) masks ancient actors used. Thus it is an image related term that does *not* refer to the abstracted substance ""ghost"" or ""soul"" refers to. That said it has not become a mindless SciFi-flic but remains a journey into a future dealing with the modern version of the ancient body/soul problem.It is to be praised if a film manages to be genuinely different than the original while still interpreting or commenting the same original point. Now one could argue whether or not it actually is the original point it is honouring. It certainly convinced me that its makers made an honest attempt at doing so - and that's all we can possibly ask for. Thus I applaud a well done interpretation, which is of course perceivably different and I dare say ""rather American"". Nothing wrong with that, as it is an American film.Although I'd have liked to hear more of the original score referenced I loved some very literal references, scenes from the original redone. These are used skillfully and weave into the plot in a good way: Although the images are ""the same"" they do play a different role in the plot. That's a great way to honour one's predecessors! The cast, the drama, the plot and characters: it all works out. Specifically Juliette Binoche and Takechi Kitano play brilliant supportive roles, which goes a long way.All in all I had a great time watching it and can only recommend checking out this film - whether or not you loved the original.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

After watching it I was compelled to write a review. Because it's ""what we do that defines us"" and ""it's justice"".Let's begin with visuals. Color spectrum is not coherent and you feel like you're watching an Ibiza party on acid in some scenes. CGI is plainly awful (although there are some nice effects, they are ruined by non-realistic ragdolls and bad 3D perspective). Visuals are the best part of the movie.The dialogues feel as they were written by a three year old. They usually don't offer any insight into the characters and sometimes feel so artificial you'll wonder if all the heroes are dull robots.Characters. Oh boy. Scarlett Johannson as Major is perhaps the worst cast since Tommy Wiseau. She's weak. Soft. Crying. Uncertain. It's like they took Motoko Kusanagi from the original and made her into an EXACT OPPOSITE. Plot. Man this is one dumb movie. It has no philosophical elements. Shooting and punching in the face. No plot twist. You can tell what's going to happen by third minute (and that's the time you should leave by the way). TLDR:If you've watched anime get a restraining order against this movie. If you haven't watched anime do the same thing. Unless you think Captain America is the pinnacle of cinematography. GITS was ruined by this movie. It's just terrible. Positive reviews have to be paid for. Sad.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

In addition to the visual fidelity, several scenes are practically the same as those of the anime. It warms the hearts of fans. As for the existential questions and the philosophy that are the forte of anime, in this adaptation does not deepen so much, but it is still there but superficial some existential questions. More than she hoped she would have. I think that in the face of Hollywood's historic adaptation of Japanese works, Ghost In The Shell is a welcome surprise.

I found the trailer amazing and immediately checked out the film from 1995. I thought it was very entertaining and thought provoking. I was hoping for something even have as good with this 2017 installment. Ghost in the Shell is fairly faithful to it's origin source and is beautiful cinematically. While I don't say the film is fantastic, I don't see it disappointing many.The story takes place in the future where a cybernetic android with the brain of a human tries to come with grips with the glitches she is seeing recently. On top of that The Major (Scarlett Johansson's lead character) tries to uncover the mystery behind her past and the dark secrets that he creators are hiding. First things first, I definitely understand when people ha e grievances about whitewashing in Hollywood. I understand that concern but also realize that these films need a really marketable actor to appease audiences and make bank. I also love ScarJo and think she's perfect for these badass heroic protagonist roles she's had in recent years. She's great in this. The supporting cast also works, nice to see Michael Pitt here.The visuals are stunning. Like gorgeous. The world of Ghost in the Shell was brought to life in a fantastic way, and then some. It's up there with some of the most beautiful city scenery I've seen in a film. If there is CG in multiple places, It's hard to notice. The action sequences and opening scenes are seamless, crisp, and sleek. It's made to be seen on the big screen.Rupert Sanders takes liberties in some areas but this film is mostly faithful to that of the 1995 film. I wish the film had an R rating just because I think more could have been accomplished in this universe with a more mature rating. It's still perfectly fine as the films futuristic tones are so alluring. The film doesn't really drag anywhere and the concepts are thought provoking.There's really not many things I can think of that detract from this film. It's great however isn't phenomenal as a whole unit, which is perfectly fine. It's on par or slightly above with expectations. The film should have enough legs for a sequel though I'd rather this be a one off deal. Final thoughts, see this in the theaters as it's visually glorious. It's very reminiscent of sci fi films of the past, like a cross between Blade Runner and The Matrix but Ghost in the Shell definitely respectfully stands on it's own two feet. Pleased with this.7.5/10","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I had to because the movie is rated too low. It should be above a 7 so I give it an 8. I find it worthwhile to warn others not to follow the opinion of the fanatics. It is said that the plot is dumbed down, but in truth, the fanatics should understand that the anime is not as deep-layered as they think it is. You don't need to see the original anime to understand what ghost in the shell means, as long as you know that this movie is about cyborgs. It's a recurring theme in any cyborg movie...even the one with JCVD. Yes, the original is good, but don't exaggerate. The fact that they don't explain everything in the cartoon doesn't make it better.What I really liked in GitS 2017 is the setting that was created on the screen. Nothing I've seen in the cinema before and it really gave me the feeling that I was watching something original, even though this is a cinematic remake. The visuals are very good. You don't go to a movie like this for the acting, it will not win Oscars, but the acting is OK. It's not an action movie, it's sci-fy, but there lies my main problem with the movie. If you don't make a film for the acting or the action, than least give more thought on the underlying message about what defines a human being. Still, GitS is worth your time. The message should have been brought clearer, but the story is still there and visually it is quite unique.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I rate this with 1 star though I would be happier if I could give it 0,5 but sadly I can't.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

It was better than I expected. I found the story to be neat. It wasn't just about the action or figuring out this case. Yes, it's set in a futuristic world and yes, it's full of beautiful visuals. But, what surprised me the most was that it evolved to something more than just an entertaining Blockbuster. There's a lot more exploration of what the Major character goes through compared to the original 1995 anime film. She has a personal quest that I actually cared for and it did get a little emotional. I never thought I would get that invested. So, that's something I have to give the movie props for.Of course the action can be underwhelming at parts, but it's still not bad. Maybe I just expected them to take action to a ""Matrix"" level of excitement. But, I can forgive that since, I do prefer a good emotional story rather than a hollow story with amazing action. It does spell out things for the audience at times. It's expected because it has to appeal to a wider audience. Although I think it could have gone without the slight Dumbing down way of explaining things.Performances are good. Scarlett was great as the Major. Sometimes when you get a really famous actor to play a part like this you can just end up seeing the actor instead of the character. This is one of those occasions were I didn't see Scarlett anymore, I saw the Major. I mean it, I was very positively surprised by this film. I was afraid it was one of those situations when a studio adapts something that's very popular to earn some money. But, I could tell the people behind the camera cared to make the best live-action adaption they could. It works as a stand-alone thing. You can go in without knowing anything about the anime or manga and enjoy this. Sure, it might be a little weird at the start, but it's easy to get into.Not amazing, but a good flick with stunning effects and a surprisingly nice character story.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

I proceeded to push back watching the film until almost a year later.I was mistaken to. The film is far from a bad adaptation, it manages to capture the same de-saturated enigmatic future in all aspects, including story. Its watered down, yes. Enough to make it a modern, viable, cinema going mass market experience but they still take chances with timing and shots that are more accurate to the 1995 Anime.This is a great go at an Anime adaption, and although i would prefer An Asian lead, I hope following Anime adaptions keep the same ability to transfer the smell, the root feel of an Anime.","12 out of 12 found this helpful.

But you also have Takeshi Kitano who talks in Japanese. Yes there will be subtitles (though in the cinema version there was no blood - not even at that one sequence we saw it in the trailer). The story and the pace are neat, it's all there to entertain you. It's not like a masterpiece, but it does what it is supposed to.

Well, it landed pretty well, but maybe not as well as most fans of the anime had hoped, or maybe it landed better than some people wished it would, because, you know, haters gonna hate.To be frank, I haven't ever watched the anime completely, mostly in parts when it was on TV when I was a kid, but I've known all about it from popular media. So this would probably disqualify me to judge a movie I haven't been the biggest fan of? Nope, just like never having read The Lord Of the Rings wouldn't disqualify anyone watching the films and thinking they're pretty amazing. If you like movies and sci-fi, you shouldn't have to be a full-fledged anime or GITS fan to appreciate this one.People who watched it with me said it was a verbatim copy of the anime, with certain scenes being identical to the original, and then some scenes were added because you can't make a 100 min movie with 80 minutes of anime. But still, if you didn't watch the original, you will not miss anything, because the movie is packed with action, car chases, cyborgs killing humans and other cyborgs, big guns, little guns, and more BIG guns - I don't wanna spoil it for you, but there will be a lot of guns.There are a few reasons you wouldn't want to watch this adaptation. One, you don't like anime. The other being the controversy about white washing this one, with Scarlett Johansson starring as the the main protagonist. I find it interesting that people complain about this, but almost never complained to all the non-Asian characters in anime, and there are a lot. How else do you explain blondes in animes? The whole white washing was rubbish brought forth by people who didn't even watch the final product but chose to voice the inner insecurities in the worst way possible.I suggest you see for yourself what it's about and either try to enjoy a pretty decent flick which does not hold back on action and good story telling, or you can watch it and then complain about all the things that annoyed you. I'm not a fan of Scarlett Johansson and I still enjoyed it (although I'd rather seen Karen Gillan in this role, but that's just me) because it had Takeshi frickin' Kitano in it, one of the most amazing Japanese actors ever.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

It's directed by Rupert Sanders and stars Scarlett Johansson as the lead.First of all, I have to say that I was ready to love this movie maybe even more than the original (and that one, I loved). I went into it open-minded, as I do with a lot of movies. I don't nitpick just to sound smart. That's not how it used to be. Because people used to enjoy movies before. And the white-washing controversy was ridiculous. It's an American remake, duh! Did you expect Asian actors in a Western spin on the story? Seriously? I'm not being racist (I find racism disgusting, actually), I just don't understand why are so many people so bothered by white-washing. But anyways, I thought this looked sick. The visuals were amazing, but I was too quick to judge a book by its cover. Because, really, that's only a shell of this movie.I liked how they took creative liberties with the plot and made it something different while sticking to the spirit of the original (and even faithfully recreating some scenes), but it never really feels like being a part of it. You don't get into it, because this world is not explained well enough. And neither are the characters. They are just there, but you don't know them and it's hard to relate. The performances are not bad, but with bland characters, it's a bit forgettable. And so is the entire movie. So, that alone takes the soul away. And only a shell is left. A very pretty shell that is. But it's still just a shell.","9 out of 31 found this helpful.

Based on the manga/anime of the same name, this film fails to engage the audience's interest, despite its interesting subject matter and influential source material.In the not-too-distant future, human beings are now able to be enhanced with robotic parts to help them with various daily tasks. One such human, Major (Scarlett Johansson), is reinforced with cybernetics to become the perfect soldier by the Hanka Robotics organisation. With these new upgrades, the organisation uses Major to hunt down cyber- criminals wreaking havoc across the city of Tokyo.Taken on its own, it is a mediocre action film but when compared to its original source material, it is a failed adaptation. The film's bland script and poorly paced direction does little to immerse the audience in the story. Occasionally there will be a decent action scene, but it feels like it is only there to prod the viewer awake after a tedious moment of exposition. Whitewashing controversy aside, Scarlett Johansson is decent in the lead role, but that is not saying much when compared to how flat and uninteresting every other character is in the film. The one thing that this film does particularly well is the visuals. The sprawling, Blade Runner-esque city of Tokyo is indeed nice to look at, but the film barely shows enough of it to leave a lasting impression. If this is the future for Hollywood adaptations of manga/anime, then I'm not too excited.I rate it 4.5/10","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

All you GITS fanboys need to get a life and stop criticizing this movie and giving it low ratings because ""It's nothing like the original"", yada, yada, yada, whine, moan, sniffle, sob, ....gasp .... OK, I get it, you have no life, GITS was your life, and this movie was the worst thing to happen to you since you were born. Life sucks, now, stop downrating this movie so other people who have never gotten into the whole GITS thing can go check out this movie and enjoy it like I did.2. Whitewashing? OMG. Do you have eyes? All Japanese anime comes pre-whitewashed! Like, duh, the Japanese want to look like Caucasians, so they draw their anime characters, especially super hero types, to look just like White Europeans! Oh, sorry, you didn't know? How long have you been watching Japanese anime? Do you actually know what a real Japanese woman looks like? And I mean a real Japanese woman who hasn't had plastic surgery to make her eyes and nose look more Caucasian, that is. Yes, that's the harsh truth - it's very common for Japanese women and men to get eyelid plastic surgery to make them look like Caucasian eyes (Koreans do this even more). So, when was the last time you pulled out your treasured DVD/BluRay of the GITS anime movie and actually looked at how the facial features of Motoko Kusanagi were drawn? I mean I just took one look at some individual images on the internet, and like, hey Motoko may have a Japanese name, but she sure looks like a White European woman to me, and Scarlett Johansson is a pretty darn good representation of this character, as drawn, by the Japanese.3. I'm a Game of Thrones fan too, and have never read the books. The book fans long ago gave up criticizing the HBO show for not following the books and simplifying the story and cutting huge amounts of stuff out. The HBO show stands out by itself. Really, live action movies have to simplify things from the original book. And speaking of GOT, I really loved seeing Euron Greyjoy play a good guy with ScarJo in this movie. Didn't quite catch Khal Moro's part in this movie, will have to see it again.4. It looks like this movie is tanking at the box office here in the U.S., so great, you GITS fanboys have helped to kill future sequels. I hope you guys are happy now.","221 out of 274 found this helpful.

Recently, ""Beauty and the Beast"" came very close in many ways to the original. Now we have another animation classic being remade into live-action. ""Ghost in the Shell"" has a real chance at being something unique, compelling, and memorable The original is an anime and, therefore, Japanese; thus, made for that audience. Therefore, this American version might have a new perspective to offer.Sadly, this new perspective turns out to be a dumbed down one. ""Ghost in the Shell"" 2017 flounders in its inability to understand the source material. In the world of ""Ghost in the Shell"" (any version), technology has reached a point where any human body part can be upgraded. The resultant population lives in varying degrees with cybernetics. People who are fully human still exist, but they are a rarity.In their essence, the setups of the two movies parallel closely. How they follow up on that is quite different. The original focused on asking questions. The remake seems to feel the need to answer those questions for the audience. The main protagonist in the films is the Major (here portrayed by Scarlett Johansson) who is just a brain in a fully robotic body. Because of this, she questions whether or not she's still human. In the original while the Major is the main character, her partner Batou is the heart of the movie. It is his unwavering confidence in the Major's humanity despite her soul rending doubts that provides the audience's perspective. Thus, the audience senses that the Major is good and empathize with Batou's belief in her.In the remake, Batou exists because he was written in the original, his perspective fades into the background noise. Instead, the Major seems to be the heart of the piece. She clearly has emotions and concerns and is desperately wanting to cling to her soul or ghost so she can be human. Problem is, by handling it this way, there is no question for the audience to weigh. Clearly, she still is human; even if she doubts it, the audience does not. Another issue this presents is that it forces Johansson to play a role that requires showing emotion while being as emotionless as possible. It's a tricky balancing act that she handles fine, but the end result is a movie whose heart is as emotionless as possible.Kudos to the filmmakers for how well the movie maintains the aesthetic of the anime classic. Nevertheless, it fails to understand what was at the heart of that movie and what made it a classic. Perhaps the simpler title ""Empty Shell"" would fit the remake better.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

Then answer is - don't watch anime before movie. Why? Short answer - anime has more complex story and ideas which it tries introduce to you, movie has ideas and other goods, but it isn't so deep. I will not spoil the story, so it is spoiler free zone. Movie was interesting and I enjoyed watching it on big screen. Scarlett's performance was solid and good - which isn't surprising if you seen her acting in ""Avengers"" and ""Lucy"". Supporting cast was good, maybe it wasn't introduced to you properly but it wasn't something you need in the first place anyways. Movie has good sound tracks, great visual effects and solid performance from cast and crew (as filming, montage, etc). It has its own look and feel which was great. Then why I gave 7? Story was good, but I would say it was too simple and already known, so if we compare with anime, movies story was re-created for wider audience so it would be more action flick not something deeper and less meaningless. Basically that all why I could take off some stars, because in other departments movie did a great job. p.s. I know there was some talks about whitewashing, but if you will watch anime and movie, it just hard to imagine another actress who could play better this role except Scarlett Johansson. And to be fair, if you watch anime you will understand that there isn't really a reason to talk about whitewashing.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Overall I wouldn't rec this movie unless you're a huge Scarlett Jo fan.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

You take a Matrix level scenario and turn it to a classic Hollywood love story. Ghost in the Shell is a deeply philosophical piece of art that goes through the problems of a post modern society and emphasizes on the birth and evolution of an entity greater than AI. So as a movie it was acceptable, but compared to anime it lacked in almost everything. From atmosphere to character quality . Thumbs up for design team, they did a great job - equal to anime.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The story follows Scarlett Johanson's character ""Major"" as she and her team of other police officer-like characters hunt down a terrorist and learn some secrets to Major's back story as well. The film succeeded in bringing to life the thought-provoking themes of the original classic while still making it relevant to a modern audience and especially, an American audience. While it may not hit every note like the original did and may not be quite as soul searching and cold, the remake improves upon the original in many ways. First, this film takes a deeper dive into Major's past and crafts her character into a much more interesting and deeper protagonist. This was probably done to appeal to a wider audience than just the fans of the original. Second, all the characters in general feel much more personal and easier to get attached to; making watching the first half much more tolerable (as it is lots of visual exposition). Everyone does a fine job with the roles they're given including Scarlett Johanson as the Major. Visual effects are some of the best and most striking you've ever seen and the action sequences are a thrill to watch. Despite this remake being a simpler and ""dumbed down"" retelling of some highly thought- provoking material, Ghost in the Shell stands as an entertaining sci-fi action movie that's sure to please fans of the original and new audiences looking of a well-done fun action movie. Definitely check this out.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Usually I don't expect some great plot from Imax movies, I just want to see something beautiful and stylish. I am not hater or super-critic and this is my first review for IMDb, but I just have to say how disappointed am I. This movie well done (visual effects) but everything else... I don't know where to start. 1. It is slow. I mean it so slow that become boring. They tried to show us some thoughtful moments, but it just don't work. 2. Plot is dumb and nothing like original, but this one I could forgive. As I said, this is not movie for Sundance festival. What I couldn't forgive is characters' misinterpretations. They looks like original visually (from anime), but characters... And worst one is Major itself. In anime she is super-cool robocop - very clever, knowing what to do, confident and even her weaknesses don't ruin her toughness. Here she is lost sheep and victim. Really? Why to name movie after famous anime if you want to do such a thing with MAIN character??? 3. Acting. Scarlet is awful :/ I don't know is it her fault or this is plot and film director, but she just don't fit in this role. I mean she is good as a sheep, but not as a Major. Since movie creators decided to make a movies about a sheep, maybe she is good for this role, but I wanted to see Major... I don't know if I could recommend this film. Maybe I could if you didn't see original series. But if you saw original, I think you will be disappointed. 3/10","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

The reason why I say this, is because this is basically a new origin story for the Major mixed with elements from the other incidents. Even if the story is now more character driven with a betrayal and revenge arc thrown in, it never felt that it wasn't a typical ghost in the shell story. I would call this Diet Ghost in the Shell, since it does have the same elements that we come to love, but is not execute as well.Scarlett Johansson performance reflects the 1995 movie and the Arise portray. She stares a lot at the camera and speaks sometimes like a robot. Other times she is more naive and does show some vulnerable emotions, which is not a good thing as Major should have a commanding presence. But regarding how the story is set up as the first year on the job, is not that bad I guess. Fortunately, Pilou portray of Batou is more spot on. He is a likable character and he deserved that little backstory about his eyes. The chemistry between Major and Batou might not be as strong as in the show, but it's still presence and has a charm to it. Rest of the Section 9 is yet again being pushed aside, but considering how the story is more driven for our main character, It's not that big of a concern. Except for Aramaki, who only speaks Japanese for some reason and has some cool scenes with a gun. Action was kind of lack luster, they did not give the proper energy it deserved, but boy does the visuals make up for it. Just look at all the neat things! Yeah, they went far with the details, and it shows that this movie is more an introduction than a stand-alone. They took scenes that people liked. Like hey, do you like that opening scene, we got that. You like that fight with the camouflage, we got you cover. And what would a GITS be without Major ripping her arms out? It's A BAD HABIT! Other than that, this movie might be one of those live action movies based from Japanese comics to be good. So I really hope this movie will have a follow up just to justify the characters and themes more. As for now, I am Taff and I give my consent.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Also, if they wanted to cast a white woman, for whatever reason, cast one that can act... that can carry the story.
Yea, yea.. she's a robot - but she's the most advanced robot, isn't she? So, why is she trudging around like her limbs are operated by gears and pulleys?I cared about Batou's eyes and the introduction of that robo-geisha was SICK!

Then in 1995 there was a Japanese anime movie by Mamoru Oshii, said to be one of the best ever in this genre. Now we have a Hollywood remake directed by the British Rupert Sanders.I have no familiarity with the original series or anime work, but I understand that this new film is more conventional but also more accessible – dialling down the philosophical considerations but turning up the action sequences. Certainly this is a visually stunning work which constantly reminds one of ""Blade Runner"" with its Asiatic urban landscape and ubiquitous advertising.Set in the not too distant future, the technology has developed which enables a human brain (the ghost) to be implanted into a robotic body (the shell) providing a combination of intuitive thinking and physical toughness that makes the ideal weapon. Major – played by Scarlett Johansson – is the first of her kind, but she is soon involved in a mission of unexpected danger and revelation.If we have to have a non-Asiatic actor in this role, Johannsen is perfect, following hard on the heels of her previous other-worldly roles in ""Lucy"" and ""Under The Skin"" plus – voice only – ""Her"". As the sexiest cyborg since Eva in ""Ex Machina"" and the most gymnastic female agent since Trinity in ""The Matrix"", Major is a force to be reckoned with, but also someone with vulnerabilities as glitches reveal glimpses of her past.""Ghost In The Shell"" may not be a science-fiction classic, like the aforementioned ""Blade Runner"" or ""The Matrix"", but it is a fine addition to the genre which I thoroughly enjoyed.

I knew it could go either way. It could be a great movie where that nail every aspect of the original anime movie or TV show with small changes to it to fit thee west or it being a flop that never knew what it had.Well it turned into a flop. I had to fight to stay and watch this movie from beginning to end. it had very poor pacing and story that was very lack luster. it was boring , even the action I felt was boring because I found it never fit with the story fully.As a fan of the anime I know the world is very tech heavy, from having androids, computers and cybernetics along with other aspects that all give it a cyberpunk feel. I never seen the cyber or the punk in this movie, they had little parts which showed it but never talked about it either with words or with visuals. there have been other movies that was cyberpunk and where able to do this, Blade runner and the Matrix are 2 I can list.What I really found with this movie it seamed like it was a check list of things they wanted to have in it for scenes. once they had the idea of what scenes that where going to have ( taken from the original anime movie ) they tried to write a story around them. this is a typical thing that is happening in Hollywood now a days or I should say years, its not story and plot that gets the movie but the action scenes that are made.I will not get into the casting cause it doesn't really matter. if they had a strong story, plot and director it could of been pulled off. They missed the mark on making a great movie and could of had a lot of information about the world and Philosophy put in there from line usage and visuals that would of explained a lot. if you do not believe me go watch the original 1995 Ghost in The Shell that had a run time of 82 Min's compared too the live actions 108 Min's.Do yourself a favor and skip this and just watch the original works.","10 out of 24 found this helpful.

There was a couple of times where the film didn't quite make sense but it wasn't a big issue, just a little silly.The film doesn't follow the themes of the original and the twist in the film was so obvious that I worked it out before I saw the film.The acting is fine but a lot of the Section 9 actors don't get much too do, which is a pity and you don't get much of the team dynamic that you get in the original or Stand Alone Complex.Another area I heard complaints before involved the score but I thought Clint Mansell did a pretty good job and I really enjoyed it, whilst it never felt like it was over powering the film.So overall I enjoyed the film. It isn't going to be the best film of the year but it isn't bad and I suspect it will be one of the better blockbuster of the year (it is certainly better then most the last few years).","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

It's not a terrible film, and I really believe most of critics were predisposed to review it badly due to the supposed whitewashing by ScarJo's casting as Major. The visuals are absolutely stunning, and I actually found myself becoming more attached to the live action version of Major than the anime one. The extra backstory certainly made me more invested in her and it made her motivations more believable and interesting. As cheesy as it perhaps was, I even liked the alternative ending in the live action movie as I felt the one in the anime wasn't very satisfying. Sure, the plot could have been ""deeper"", but I almost felt like the anime was too deep, i.e. too much lofty dialogue about philosophical stuff instead of exploring those topics simply thorough character actions and the visuals. The live action movie could have been improved by sticking closer to the some of the scenes in the anime, especially aesthetic-wise, and I think I would've liked it even more if it was R rated as it would've added some extra grit. I recommend that you watch it for yourself before judging it.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Not of the franchise, I wasn't that involved, but I really did love the films. So, this film was visually stunning, -stunning- I can't stress that enough. And I'm not talking about fancy CGI here, this was an amazing piece of art. You could watch it even without a script and it would make sense! Also, amazing soundtrack -of course- and a true nod to the original (aesthetically).The only difference I found in the script (in general, not the plot), was that this film was a character driven story. All the philosophical stuff stemmed from the protagonist's experiences. It's a good way to keep an audience interested, it's the go to of Hollywood and it is something I expected and honestly, really didn't mind. Major has an interesting story to tell. Plus I went into the cinema and expected to see something that could stand on its own feet and not just recreate the anime. What's the fun in that? Plus, guys, this is Hollywood, if they took the ""lets talk about human nature"" way, we'd be simply telling them not to play with things they don't understand. This is the kind of film that Hollywood makes, and this particular film is actually a good example of that kind of film. I didn't give it a 10 because that's kept for real masterpieces and this film just misses that special something. As if it reached the edge of what was achievable but in the end, didn't take the leap. Still a great film though.As for the casting, I think they were all wonderful. Scarlett too, she did a great job making her movements robotic, everything she did was calculated and her stillness in some shots was really eerie but her eyes were so freaking expressive, as if all that was left of her humanity was hiding there, well done Scarlett.Speaking of whom, I feel I need to address this subject. Is there whitewashing happening in Hollywood. Duh, of course there is. Is it normal to want an Asian actress to be cast in a film taking place in an Asian environment? Sure is. Is it a stretch to say that Scarlett freaking Johansson was cast in a role because she was white? Eeeeh, it kind of is. I mean, she's not some random white girl, she's the highest grossing actress of all time, the A list of Hollywood's A list, who wouldn't cast her? And for a film that would be criticized by fans anyway because ""it's a Hollywood production of a Japanese title again"" why not bring in the big guns to attract the general populace? I'm not going to go into the ""Major is a cyborg so she can be of any background because she doesn't have one"" debate, because I think it didn't play a part in the casting decision, it was clearly a marketing choice to cast someone who is already famous and popular. Plus Johansson is THE action girl these days, I mean, who else would Hollywood cast?","147 out of 185 found this helpful.

Mira Killian (Scarlett Johansson) is chosen as the test subject after her body is damaged beyond repair . Over the objections of her designer Dr. Ouelet (Juliette Binoche) , Hanka Robotics CEO Cutter (Ferdinando) decides to use Killian as a counter-terrorism operative . A year later , Killian has attained the rank of Major in the anti-terrorist division Section 9 commanded by Chief Daisuke Aramaki (Takeshi Katano) , working alongside operatives Batou (Pilou Asbæk) and Togusa (Chin Han) . She's has been subjected to a cyber regeneration that turns her into the perfect soldier dedicated to stopping the most dangerous cybercriminals . Major Motoko is on the trail of a super hacker (Michel Pitt) who can hack into human brains . She and her bland sidekick Bateau become embroiled in a conspiracy involving a secret government project , interdepartment rivalries , but things go wrong . The more the Major works on the case, the more conflicted she becomes , for all that remains of her original body is a small slice of brain . In a world where only humanity some people are their ghosts or souls , where they may or may not be within the shells or bodies they were born with , what happens when a ghost exists where it should not ? They did not save your life !. They stole it !.Adaptation to the big screen , in real image, of the cult manga, Ghost in the shell , whose first episode was published by Masamune Shirow (stage name of Masanori Ota) in 1989, which has garnered a whole cohort of loyal followers, including those that stand out Steven Spielberg, James Cameron and Lilly and Lana Wachowski. This epic saga also has two anime feature films that marked the era , two television series, novels and video games.Set in the society of the near future in which the border between human beings and technology is increasingly blurred. This goes back to the origins of Major Mira Motoko , she is the best of her kind : A human saved from an allegedly lethal accident , who is cyber-enhanced to be the perfect agent against crime , and wielding an immaculate synthetic body , being assigned to detain the world's most heinous delinquents . She is the first human subjected to cyberregeneration who leads a team - Section 9 - to fight crime , but when peculiar hallucinations interpreted as minor glitches start to bombard Mira's fragmented mind, suspicions will arise . Along with the philosophical questions about the nature of humanity that are heavily interlaced within the plot , this spectacular movie features slick sciene-fiction story and top-quality frames . The motion picture was well directed by Rupert Saunders , though with no originality , that's why it not match enough with the human landscape at the heart of the story . Sanders made this succesful Ghost in the Shell (2017) and an episode of Foundation series (2021) and another hit : Snow White and the Huntsman (2012). Rating : 6.5/10 . Better than average. The yarn will appeal to Scarlett Johansson fans .","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Scarlett reprises her role as Black Widow and Lucy, fighting her way physically and also emotionally in the search for who Major is.The plot is a little frayed, but most of the dialogue holds up, although Danustia Samal's choice to exaggerate her British accent is bizarre and grating. There is a lot of finding inner peace mumbo jumbo, memory slithers emerging from the fog and silly birthing metaphors. Presumably this is imagery to amplify Major's inner turmoil and 'need to know', but it is heavy handed and largely unnecessary.In-the-round a watchable movie that does not rip up any trees.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

She's got the brain/mind (ghost as it's called here) of a human with some type of organic robotic body. Bionic body enhancements are all the rage at the time, with regular folk getting some body parts enhanced.When there's some attack on the corporations executives, Major intervenes against the orders of her superior. There she discovers the villain, a geisha that is some type of robot who spews an ominous message warning all the employees of the corporation. We learn that something's wrong with Major's system. She sees things that then vanish. We learn that in the process of her creation, her memories have been wiped clean and she was told she's the first of her kind.To get some lead on the bad guy behind the attack, Major decides to undergo a risky procedure where she interfaces with the system of the geisha. It helps her discover a location for the bad guy that she and her partner cop then raid. But the bad guy, named Kuze, was ready for them and they end up badly damaged. In the meantime, Kuze keeps going after the corporation. During an attack, Major captures one of Kuze's minions. When she faces him, Kuze speaks through him. That allows our law enforcement group to track Kuze's location. There Major finds a bunch of human connected to some network. Finally she runs into Kuze who tells her something revealing about herself and also about him. He shares some of her broken memories and is working on an alternate network and suggests she look into these visions/memories, which she does and discovers some more about herself.Once the agenda of the corporation and of Kuze are known, the battle lines are drawn and there's a bit of a surprise about who's good and who's bad. There will be some final confrontation between Kuze and the corporate higherups and Major will have to pick a side.Ghost in the Shell is a rather visually ugly sci-fi movie with a good message. Things are pretty dry and Johansson is starting to specialize in these robotic flat performances. I found the Japanese angle to be a distraction since you have to keep track of the Japanese names and one cast-member's dialogue is even in Japanese.A sci-fi movie should at the very least offer something of an interesting world. This movie doesn't. Granted it's based on some comic that I'm not familiar with, but still, surely they could have at least tried to give us something interesting to look at. As it is, the world of the movie is the standard big city dark gray future with lots of big neon signs while cars fly by. So both visually and conceptually, the movie fails. Visually appealing is only Johansson in some tight skin-colored rubber suit, if that's what it is, it might as well be CGI, so even there the appeal is minimized. But in typical Japanese fashion, she's got a terrible haircut. The movie could have given us some interesting science, but it doesn't. Things improve with the appearance of Kuze and Michael Pitt's performance. At that point we get a bit of morality injected into the story which helps a lot and something meaningful is finally at stake.Ghost in the Shell doesn't live up to its potential. It is somewhat lackluster but it's still worth a watch.","6 out of 20 found this helpful.

I didn't know the anime heritage, until after the movie, when the person, next in the seat to me, told me that the movie was based on a anime with the same name. The person recommended that I see the anime. I haven't, but here is the review. The film has some Bladerunner feel to the design of the city they are in. The city has the same colors, the same darkness and the same technological noise and flickering really. There is also one Borg moment for the Star Trek fans, when the Major hibernates in Major's apartment. The Major is the lead character, played by Scarlett Johansson. Also Alan Walker's video ""Sing me to sleep"" has the same feel as the whole movie design set really. In the music video the environments fade and so they do in this movie to. The hacker in the movie also wears a hoodie, so stereotype for a hackers ""image"". So this movie doesn't deliver something new in the design department, but since i happen to think the references to the design are great, so is this movie. The designs are interesting and beautiful, but not new. Scarlett Johansson plays the lead role as Major. Someone ripped her brain out and placed it inside a robot body. The Major hasn't much memory of the past, so Major lives in the present. Major is a expensive machine, just like Robocop, out fighting for the Japanese government with the help of a private company named Hanka Robotics. This brain in a robot body is just as the Borg queen in the Star Trek Next Generation series, the Borg queen has her spine still though. But just as the Borg queen has access to the Hive, so does the Major, the Major can talk ""telepathically"" with the team(with the help of technology of course). Either anime was first, or this movie has a lot of references to Star Trek. However, even though Star Trek also takes up the ethical surrounding the Borg hive and individuality, so does this ""Ghost in a shell"", but still this movie doesn't feel as the ""Borg"", it has the feel of ""Irobot"", but since the Major is a human, Major doesn't phase the same issue of not being considered human. Major is the next step in evolution of humanity. So what is the story really? Well, some earlier reviews said the story is shallow, but I happen to disagree. It is about finding out what really matters for you and what you could do for your beliefs when you do. So with that said, this is a sci-fi movie, that isn't boring in any way. It has a artistic feel to it and in the end we get to know the Major just a little bit more, enough to want more episodes of this film, even without action and murder. Just to explore the cyber human, that most likely will be possible, due to the more artificial stuff we invent. So is this the future? Cyber humans? With body parts of technology? So are the new threat the hackers in this universe? Those that can hack into the cyber humans technology? What happens to free will, if your mind is hacked? I think this movie addresses some of the fears hidden inside the development of cyber humans. The Major has no privacy, since all her thoughts can be read. So is this a possible further step for mankind? Are we gonna be connected to hives, in a neural network? This movie doesn't tell us what it would be like. This movie seems to be pro for cyber humans. It seems to be anti-hackers, but at the same time glorifies and demonizes them. Major has a special walking style through the film, so it doesn't come off as a human body in fully. I think Scarlet does it well. I actually like this film and in the genre of sci-fi I would like to give the movie a strong grade. This movie might disappoint anime watchers, since it didn't feel anime to me in the designs. It is a very Japanese movie, with feelings of Japanese designs all over it. I wasn't bored at any time and time flew fast. There is no sex in this film, so if you like love scenes you are going to be disappointed.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Don't let this film be tarnished by that fad.I will do my best to make this short and sweet. (Probably not)READ: (For those who HAVEN'T seen the original films)This film is a fantastic example of a film that is complex yet simple. I expected the worst from the film and I received more. I won't lie to you and tell you this film is on par with something like The Matrix (the original was) but it is well worth seeing and stands out as unique. We all know that's nearly impossible to do these days. Please take this into consideration and go to see the film with no expectations. You'll be surprised that way.READ: (For those who HAVE seen the original films)I'm sorry this film wasn't everything we dreamed it would be, but can we honestly act surprised when Hollywood screenwriters avoid immensely complex story arches? They have simplified this story for the masses in the same way The Lord of the Rings was simplified for the masses. If you spend your time comparing this film with the originals you will come up short, every time. This is NOT the original film, this is its own film that you need to appreciate as it stands (I know that is difficult, believe me). If you haven't already seen it, please take my word for it and go in with no expectations, go in cold (like it is a new experience). (Final Comments)I take user reviews to heart for movies. I appreciate the opinions of the people more than I appreciate the opinions of the paid critics. Seeing a 6.9 as the current user score (as of March 31st) is unfortunate, because this film captures EVERYTHING that Ghost in the Shell was and thanks to this film IS CURRENTLY. As a film it stands strong in the Sci-Fi genre and does manage to still be thought-provoking. Please consider taking your time before giving it a low rating. Understand that the talents that put this film together adopted this baby from its original developers and they did NOT destroy it, as some over-exaggerators may proclaim. ""The Last Airbender"" - THAT is an example of something being destroyed. GHOST IN THE SHELL stands still intact. Of course it isn't as fleshed out and philosophical as the original film (which paid an immaculate amount of attention to detail and information) but it DOES live in the same world and it DOES tell the same story. I promise you that if it HAD stayed completely with the script of the animated film, it would be getting attacked for being an unnecessary remake or overly complicated.I've given this an 8 out of 10 because I see 6 as mediocre and 10 as a perfect film. 8 is somewhere in between. I do not believe this is the best adaption or sci-fi film I've seen, but it was enjoyable and much pain-staking work was put into it... that shows when you watch it. Don't be entirely emotional about the way you view this movie. Watch it for what it is, not what it is in comparison.Thank you for reading, I appreciate it. Take the time to see this movie and take your time before rating it. Really chew on it first, because it deserves better than it is receiving.","1,581 out of 2,116 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Good on it's own merits, but lacks any sense of subtly","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3685898/?ref_=tt_urv","KeroScee","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30080189/?ref_=tt_urv","16 April 2017","The original 'Ghost in the Shell' was a hallmark gem of which has been the base for many 'near future' movies to copy, borrow and steal from for the past 20 plus years. It's difficult to write a review without making a comparison, but avoiding the parallels is not made easy when this live action fails in achieving the nuances that the original material essentially invented.It's a true shame. Set and costume design is top notch, a very capable cast demonstrate talent and exceptional emotional depth in the few moments they can. But again, and again, the childishly written, overly simplistic script and over-reliance of cheap linear VFX sequences ruin all the good work in other avenues. The story moves in a predictable fashion, with much of the plot movement spontaneously directed by characters suddenly 'knowing' vital locations and details without any adequate visual or audible explanation. 'GITS' fans may notice how the pacing links with on screen events easily, but newcomers will be a little at odds as to how 'hacking' works in the future when there are no sequences that show it off. A likely result of poor scripting, editing and a refusal to add coherent infodumps or 'so you know' scenes.This poor scripting shows, conversations are extremely one dimensional. Intentions are plain to see and many sequences occur with very little justification or thought. The whole film reeks of studio meddling and too many script writers. The interactions between Major (Scarlett Johansson) and Batou (Pilou Asbæk )are arguably the best parts of the movie, which makes them feel like they're written by someone else. Likewise much of the themes that 'GITS' relied on are nigh non-existent. The notion of constructed identities and hacked memories are left in wasteland as poorly thought out corporate conspiracies take centre stage. The whole thing feels very much like the recent Robocop remake; poorly handled.Overall Ghost in the Shell is worth seeing if only for the set design and effects. The on screen chemistry between Scarlett Johansson and Pilou Asbæk is worth studying on how to show inferred love. Everything else? Forget about it.6/10","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The Ghost in the Shell from 2017 and The Ghost in the Shell from 1995 are so different that in many ways they cannot be compared. The central messages from either is not like the other beyond a surface level, and the story and style of each is vastly different. I do believe that this is an overall good movie, but it feels more like someone's in depth fanfiction that reveals characters' backstories than a remake of the original. The changes made were so drastic that you can understand when there are direct references that tie it back to the 1995 version, but beyond setting and characters, they are not very much alike. The changes made were mostly appropriate and acceptable, with a few exceptions which made me roll my eyes (and which I am not going to specifically point out in order to avoid spoilers). There were new scenes added and old shots revisited, but nothing seemed very out of place. I did not enjoy the shift in antagonist or the explanation of Major's backstory, but one can only expect this when an extremely deep and strange concept is being adapted for a Western audience that craves almost nothing action. Those who have not seen the original film may not see many large problems with it. Those who have seen the original will probably be cringing at some crucial aspects that were changed. The story is not necessarily weak overall, but it is rather cliché and more predictable than I, and many others, I'm sure, would have liked. I must admit that I have not seen the original sequels to the 1995 film, so forgive me if some of the changes are references to other details that were described in the later movies, but as a whole the original story should have been enough to produce a large audience based on intrigue and entertainment alone. The only reasonable explanation that I can come up with for why they would change the story so drastically is that they wanted it to be open for a sequel. Visually, Ghost in the Shell is stunning, and I cannot think of a single aspect of the design that I disliked. The reinvention of Section 9, while perhaps more optimistic than the original, was beautiful, believable, and extremely fitting. The set design is fantastic, the cinematography was great, and the occasional recreation of iconic destinations was so spot-on it was nearly scary. If I had watched this movie muted and without subtitles I would still enjoy it. The soundtrack is very fitting. It is not much like the original, but I did enjoy the soft voices in the songs near the beginning and end that brought back waves of nostalgia from the original theme. I know some people are going to complain about it, but this movie has an entirely different feel from the original, and the music fits the film this movie is, not the film this movie tried to recreate.In short, if you enjoy the original, disconnect it from this movie and you will enjoy yourself. At the very least it is beautiful and entertaining. If you haven't seen the original, don't worry, you'll still have a good time watching it. This is probably the best adaptation of an anime I have seen so far, and while that is not saying much considering its competition, it at least proves that progress is being made, and that in the future we may get a fantastic interpretation of another film or series.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Those who think they have the answer are usually mistaken. Major who is given a body, not just any body but a Scarlett Johansson body, finds her law enforcement gig less fulfilling without a memory of her past even when reassured by her creator, Dr. Phil, played by the lovely Juliette Binoche, that life is defined by what one does rather than one's memories or past. And of course, everybody and his dog know Dr. Phil is full of it. Like Major, nobody is free from his past and everybody is burdened by history. The movie doesn't come with any surprise everything happens just as expected or even like a déjà vu. Every futuristic cityscape scene is derivative of Blade Runner except it is a knockoff and ten times cheesier. The Hong Kong streetscape can be interesting only if the post production doesn't feel obliged to add more and more and yet more video gimmickries to the mix. The few architectural shots are almost facsimile copies of Peter Stewart's pictures of the same. The 1.85:1 aspect ratio is supposed to give audience an immersive experience but sometimes I can't help but feel like watching 4:3 standard definition TV, also the PG-13 rating doesn't help either. Nothing good can come out of any existential crisis not even good cinema in this case. Scarlett Johansson does have very good skin which manages to salvage the movie from downright unwatchable to somewhat entertaining and somewhat watchable. Between Kong: Skull Island and Ghost in the Shell, the choice is obvious.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

That is not the case with Ghost in the Shell. Ghost in the Shell truly is CGI loaded, but not only for useless effects, but also to create background, atmosphere and character. Partially they succeeded and created one of the more beautiful backgrounds we have seen in a while, and also managed to create a character that is torn between being human and artificial.Unfortunately, they only did that with Scarlett Johansson. Obviously some other characters (a) gave terrible performances or (Binoche, Pitt) (b) were good but not given enough screen time or development (Pilou, Takeshi, and others). Especially the main villain, who was menacing UNTIL the reveal, took away the only bit of tension there ever was.This is not a rare thing and happens to movies who try to put too much story or too much characters into one movie. This should have been a longer movie, or a series. A world needs to be build and characters need to develop. Especially the last one didn't happen here. Still a 6 for the effects, Johansson and the amazing action design.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

But I did not expect such cinematic splendor and costume/set design.Story: Dead -It is dead because it chopped up story from the previous movies and tried to Frankenstein them together, whilst adding in new backstory that only made fans cringe. There was no life there, Rupert should have tried to move forward with new content instead of trying to play it safe like Star Wars Episode 7.Characters: Dead -The life that was brought into the anime characters was lost here. There was an attempt to give ""The Major"" and emotional core that amplified her so called ""Ghost"". However in reality (Anime) the majors ghost was not highlighted by any emotions whatsoever, only her observance as to the lack of said feelings. Her philosophical and analytical nature was what gave her the notion of a ""Ghost"". So in a sense, they restructured the very definition of who the Major was.Batou attempted to be a good buddy like he was in the anime, but he never really had the chance, the story moved too quickly and his connection was lost. I think the Major had too much baggage going on to allow anyone else to show themselves.The side characters (Section 9 crew) were all just background fluff and didn't even matter, which is good because I don't think I could handle any more characters being misrepresented.Aramaki was alright, I think Kitano was just used for novelty purposes, and these days he is just like a Japanese Harrison Ford, grumpy and only around for the money.Set Design: -Alive. Alive in every way, the world they used was full of cyberpunk goodness stripped right out of the heart of the anime. Every detail was accounted for and it truly was the highlight of the entire film. I will include the background characters and extras into this as well, they were all very much apart of the world and the state of society was quite evident.Sound: -Alive, but misplaced. The music was fantastic, but never seemed to show up on time, it was always late for the party. Even the music for the into sequence(for the anime) didn't arrive until the credits. For them to leave out the song was advertise with the new intro out of the new intro.......there are no words.I like this movie a lot, I will be picking it up on 4k Blu-Ray asap, because I am only going back for the beauty of the cinematography and CGI. The story in this movie will be forgotten and left out of all the ancient tomes of the Ghost in the Shell universe.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Johansson does a good job portraying the cold but likable Major. Only problem with her is a bit too much emotion... But I'm sure that's the fault of the director.They missed some opportunities the anime did masterfully. The pan around the city set the mood perfectly and the dead silent spider tank scene made it extremely tense. I don't understand why they chose to remove/change two very iconic scenes.But yeah... It's a good sci-fi action film for those who never saw the original. But a bit of a disappointment for those who did.Also, just to add my point of view on the ""whitewashing"" debate.

Connected to something, I'm not."" Major (Scarlett Johansson) It is less about hybrid human android Scarlett Johansson kicking ass in cult manga tradition than it is about her character, Major, finding out who she is. The fascinating Ghost in the Shell has the typical sci-fi tropes with enough grave philosophy underneath to raise it toward the transcendent level of a, say, Eugene O'Neill drama.In a dystopian future, cyber-enhanced humans have an unusual makeup of body parts and that elusive ghost in that shell, the soul. While the good guys prefer the borgs just do their job of eliminating dangerous criminals and saving empires, the complex of character emanating from a head, for instance, that has not lost its desire for freedom, is a ""major"" problem, so to speak.Another intriguing difference from other current sci fi is its unwillingness to litter the landscape with destructive shells, the explosive kind. ""We cling to memories as if they define us, but they don't. What we do is what defines us."" (Major) Gunfire is at a minimum while the search for soul is pre-eminent. Although Major can shoot and fight with the best of them, the film seems to be anchored by identity, more about the human elements of androids than even the individual identity.Credit should be given to the darkly-beautiful design of Jan Roelfs and costumes out of this world by Kurt and Bart. Cinematographer Jess Hall evidences the influence of the memorable Blade Runner landscape.In the end Major finds like the rest of us she's made of many parts that if you rely on the corporeal only are just as soon to evaporate. It's the soul that makes the difference, the soul that promises immortality, the ghost in the shell of an evanescent body.""Well, maybe next time you can design me better.""

There are some similarities to Oshii-san's fight scenes from the anime that translated very nicely to film. The kinetic energy of the fighting and shooting did harken to some of Masamune Shirow's manga and earlier works, such as black magic m66 and appleseed. Added some HK grittiness to heighten the flavor. Also add Oshii-san fave dog for kawaii factor.I was impressed with the film to try and to condense the story of science, eastern religion, western religion, philosophy and psychology of the manga that Masamune Shirow penned. The story in the manga is very rich and thick with all sorts of the things stated above. The production staff probably toiled for many months to try and make the chaotic world of Masamune Shirow as palatable as possible. I am sure Frederik L. Schodt and other translators had a similar problem translating all of the Japanese to make sense. I still was blown by the story and complex by the source material.I am only disappointed that the director didn't have the courage to dig deeper into this complex and fascinating universe. I guess time and money like all things hollyweird is always the issue. Like the manga, it pays to re-read/watch the film again.I would like to say lastly there technically was an Asian actress in the lead film... it is based on interpretation.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

For those who do not know it is a Japanese TV series and films with sequel. It is about cyber crime and what is life and what is just a machine.I hope this is helpful for you out there.I went to watch the film as a first date with a fan. The guy loved and watched the original and could tell you all about the Section, the Chief, The Major and Mega Tech. He was unimpressed because the major lacked nudity, music was not in the right place and also the film assumed it is more clever and knows more than the original.Whatever the case, I thought the action was good. Think like Matrix and its sequels. There are some impressive effects. Scarlet Johansson was too dry and robotic, but perhaps she is supposed to be. I mean she is a robot basically. Then again, I never liked her. I mean she is the extra and unneeded character in the Avengers. She is there for no reason so I suppose I brought that misgiving with myself into this film.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Ghost in the Shell really isn't a series you just jump into it has a pretty complex story line in a complex world with complex characters. The anime itself takes a while to get into but how would it stand up as a movie?The movie was okay. It was confusing in the 1st part and started to come together in the second part but just knowing about the other interesting things that take place in the Ghost in the Shell universe it just seemed pretty boring. Section 9 is pretty much like a secret A-Team. The come in and handle the Governments dirty work. I kind of expected to see that plot come into play but it's about ""The Major"". The Major is a main character but Ghost in the Shell isn't about her. Matter of fact sometimes she's just there as a background character. Ghost in the Shell is about Section 9 working together to catch terrorists and foil plots their plots.The Major's character is intelligent,strong and a true mercenary. She doesn't show any weaknesses. She just gets the job done and done well. Watching the movie I felt like it broke way from her character in the Anime series and made her too human and fragile. What killed me though is that they gave her a background and revealed it and that is the main plot of the movie. In the Anime ""The Major"" is a complete mystery and that's what kind of makes her character. She has all these abilities but little is known about who she really is.That big change they made kind of made the movie feel less ""Ghost in the shell like"". Section 9 takes a back seat and even though the names are there you never really get to know any of the team the way you should. I think maybe if they made a sequel they would be able to focus more on section 9 like they should have but with the way this movie sunk at the box office I doubt there will be one.The so called white washing of characters is mainly just 1 character. ""The Major"" I don't think it was really fair for the movie to get bashed so much but Scarlett's wooden acting in any movie she plays in didn't help make her role believable.I think this is a movie that would do better as it gains sequels where more of the Ghost in the Shell stories is released. Kind of like the anime it takes a while to dive into and grow on you.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The Matrix films especially. That said, there is a feeling of being too generic at the same time. The film doesn't create anything new. More of a homage to some of those (much better) previous films.Scarlett Johansson isn't good in the film. She looks very attractive and eye pleasing on screen, but with no personality. She has no charisma. Any fashion model type with a pretty face could have done this role just as well. She has no presence in the film. You can try and excuse it by saying she is trying to act robotic, but no, that is just a lame excuse. She must bring something to the table, instead of being a non-presence. She can't carry a film, not going by this example, at any rate.I'm being very generous by giving it a 6, just because it has a few good action scenes, nice set design, and a few good one-liners said by some of the other characters. And the film does not feel too boring, but moves along at a good clip.

I love cyber-punk. I love action. And I'm at least tolerant of excessive use of computer-generated effects in cinema in general. Oh, and I guess I might as well confess that my DVD collection contains many films containing women in skin-tight attire wiping out hordes of muscular henchmen (think 'Resident Evil' meets the 'Underworld' saga). Anyway, seeing as I like all those (plus I'm a fan of Marvel's Cinematic Universe which contains Scarlett Johansson doing all of the above) then you'd think that the film 'Ghost in the Shell' was absolutely made for me 100%.I've finished watching it at last (it was on an online streaming service, allowing me to watch the whole film in three segments - I guess that some people may say that the 'stop/start' approach to watching a film may ruin the enjoyment of it, however I beg to differ in this case). And, although I may be sounding a little cynical about the whole experience, I definitely didn't hate it. In fact, there's very little negative I can say about it. However, the problem is that there's very little positive about it, too.It's the very definition of 'average.' If you've seen one film where someone has superpowers and has to kill a load of people (combine it with memory loss for added cliches) then you've basically seen this one. Scarlett Johansson plays 'Major' - a cyborg assassin in the near future who hunts down and kills... blah, blah, blah. She then gets double-crossed... blah, blah, blag and you're left with her running around killing every human baddie and spider-tank that stands in her way.I guess I better write this review quickly as I'm already starting to forget what it was all about. I know it was based on an anime series/film (er, I think!), but I know for a fact that I've never seen the source material so I can't claim to know how two two mediums compare.There's plenty to say that's good about it - cool city-background (CGI, obviously), neat and original gadgets and tech (I think I mentioned the 'spider-tank!') and Scarlett Johansson is pretty damn easy on the eye (for us guys, anyway) and basically plays the MCU's 'Black Widow,' albeit in cyborg form (and looking more 'CGI' when she runs up walls!). If you're not familiar with the genre and generally haven't seen many similar movies then I'm guessing you'll absolutely love this film and I apologise for my (distinctly average) final score. However, I've seen so many of these sorts of films that they really need to pull off something really special in order for it to rise above all the others I've seen.I would imagine that, judging by the ending, the producers of this film really were hoping that this will be the start of some sort of major (no pun intended!) franchise. However, I just can't see that happening. Although, if it does get a sequel, I'll happily sit down and watch that, too. Again, I didn't hate this film - far from it - it just didn't really leave much of a lasting impression with me. Sorry, Scarlett.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Definitely recommended.","13 out of 14 found this helpful.

I agree with him. Now finally on bluray and digital hd, this underrated gem has great visual effects, a good soundtrack that borrows elements from the anime movie, its sequel, and the series, yet the story moves at a slow pace sometimes and can be confusing if anyone hasn't seen the original stories. The reason why it failed at the box office was due to competition from other movies in the US yet elsewhere especially in Japan it was met with applause.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Well, the answer is too obvious to even say.With that out of the way, I do think the film had some problems. ScarJo just didn't seem to fit her role, in my opinion. Not enough of a dramatic actress and also not really a top action star. I think Lucy also suffered from the same issue. I did like her in The Island though!Beyond that I do think the story needed a bit of work. It didn't pull me in quite enough because I felt like I already knew what was going to happen. Possibly a byproduct of this being a remake? It really should have been an independent film.

Scarlett Johansson is heroic compassion as the human and mostly machine Major in Director Rupert Sanders's ""Ghost in the Shell"". ""Ghost in the Shell"" is the wonderful surprise that is both visually provocative action and the compelling existential exploration of humanity. Set in near futuristic Japan, cybernetic or robotic enhancements of humans are common place in the world. In this global incarnation Hanka Corporation is the technology leader seeking to change the world. Whether this change is for good is the real question?In the enthralling visual opening narrative scientists implant the residual human brain in the robotic 'shell' that becomes Johansson's Major. Composed of electronics and metal alloy, the beautiful Major emerges from the laboratory liquid pool of flesh and hair—nearly human. Johansson is awesome. She has this mesmerizing stillness even in the gate of her walk. She disposes villains with explosive martial arts excellence. Sanders wisely leverages close ups of Johansson, whose face in both the spoken and unspoken eloquently expresses courage and vulnerability. Johansson commands ""Ghost in the Shell"" as her own. Scarlett powerfully captures the emblematic paradox; her Major is more machine, than human in her search for her very humanity—her soul. She inspires as the hero discovering and defining herself. Her creators create and design her as the perfect soldier to combat the global terrorist threat. She confesses to her beloved creator caretaker Dr. Ouelet, played by poignant and strong Juliette Binoche, ""What I have is not real."" She speaks of her memories and her past. Dr. Ouelet tells her hero that it is not the memories you hold, ""It's what you do that defines you"" The screenplay by Jamie Moss, William Wheeler, and Ehren Kruger is based on the classic Manga by Masamune Shirow. This movie is also the reinvention of the 1995 Amine feature film. The 'ghost' is the remnant of soul implanted in the robotic or cybernetic 'shell'. Does the soul exist? One's design doesn't determine your purpose. Does the Major deserve to find love? I was happy that the search for the soul infused in this narrative, and that Johansson embodies the existential hero's purpose—discovering who she is. With brazen visual style the Major battles evil villains in literal pseudo-nakedness. Johansson is sexy, haunting, and isolated. This kind of symbolizes the stark lone nature of her very quest. As in the original Anime, the Major dramatically disrobes from her overcoat, then like the Dark Knight descends upon her evil prey. In a conflict arc the naked Major pummels the fleeing criminal in the rain filled pond, nearly killing. Her hulking fellow cyborg Batou, played by sarcastic but nurturing Pilou Asbaek, mercifully prevents her. The Major fights with calculated precision, and consumed rage. Since 'high-jacking' the program of a terrorist robot, the Major has bizarre images perhaps from her past. Is her dormant humanity emerging?This makes ""Ghost in the Shell"" compelling. Sanders's future Japan has the layered holographic feel of ""Blade Runner"" and the austere heroic night imagery of ""The Dark Knight"". The collective cyber- consciousness and virtual 'plug-ins' remind of ""The Matrix"". The Major discovering her inherent soul is amazing. Sanders falters a bit in the story arc when Johansson's Major talks with someone dear from her passed life. He is too restrained; he could have risked bringing us to tears. Poetically, he resolves this later in the Major's hero journey. After creating the Major, Machiavellian Hanka CEO Cutter, played by ruthlessly good Peter Ferdinado, transfers her to Section 9—the Government's elite anti-terrorist group. Section 9 is headed by the old and wise Aramaki, played with gravitas by Takeshi Kitnao. Batou becomes the Major's protector and friend, who may also be in love with her. Cutter distinguishes the Major as the revolutionary first of her kind. But is she the first? There are so many lies, including those surrounding the Major. The possible villain arises in cyber-enhanced Kuze, played by charismatic Michael Pitt. Section 9 and the Major investigates Kuze's murder of all those associated with 'Project 2571'—cloaked in secrecy. Perhaps, the Major was not the first? And the stories of her origins may be lies as well. The Major and Kuze's present and past may be tragically bound. I thoroughly enjoyed ""Ghost in the Shell"" for its visual style, thought provoking story, and entirely for Scarlett Johansson's performance. Her movie star presence transcends the character and the movie. I read and heard about the ""whitewashing"" in casting Scarlett instead of a Japanese actress as the Major. Johansson is amazing. The character of the Major is more machine, than human. ""The Ghost in the Shell"" is about the nature of the soul. Perhaps, the shape of your eyes has little to do with the quality of your soul. I say this as a Japanese American movie fan. The touching epilogue of ""Ghost in the Shell"" makes this perfectly clear. ""Ghost in the Shell"" is surprising and very gratifying.","248 out of 340 found this helpful.

This film fails mostly due to the writers and directors not knowing what they wanted from this movie. They had a massive budget to craft and create a beautiful and thought-provoking piece of art. Was the estimated $110,000,000 worth it... NO! Not one penny of it.The writers strangely opted to not tell the original story but to create a mish-mash of the Original 1995 Ghost In The Shell Movie and the Second Gig of the 2004 Series, along with the Basset Hound from the less-than- stellar Ghost In The Shell II: Innocence and make it a 12a Certificate (WHY?). Unfortunately by doing this the messages which the originals gave the audience is lost. In fact, the idea of ""The Ghost"" is so heavy-handedly hammered into you I thought I might need a doctor. If the writers, Jamie Moss, William Wheeler, and Ehren Kruger couldn't come up with a decent original story based on the G.I.T.S. Universe than a straight forward remake would have been better. To be honest, now that A.I.'s are closer than ever the original story would have been more poignant.As for the direction, this was lazy, to say the least as director, Rupert Sanders copies some scenes and mixes others together. All the original shots within the film are pretty unimpressive.I also hope that the acting and characterisations of the cast were down to Sanders vision of the movie as most of them put in sub-standard portrayals. The worst of which is Takeshi Kitano who plays Section 9's leader Aramaki. This character is wily like a fox, though does show quite a bit of emotion on his face and in his voice. Kitano just feels like he turned up, said his lines, then went home. It's such a lacklustre appearance that in some scenes I thought Sanders had just inserted a still shot and dubbed the speech over. As for Scarlett Johansson their's nowhere near enough presence or assurance in her portrayal of the major. For most of the scenes, she skulks around with her head down. This is a strong and assured character. Bad guys and people, in general, should be weary of her. This could be down to the butchering of her backstory that Moss, Wheeler, and Kruger did. Not only does it lessen the character but is nonsensical and quite stupid. The only one who comes out of this film looking good is Pilou Asbaek as his Batou was pretty decent, though the writers again messed up a solid backstory - though not so bad this time.As for the special effects and CGI, these were okay, though not too impressive. However, the Geisha sequence is really good, as is the arm tearing sequence, and I really like the doctor's eyes and the PA's fingers.which kept in with the original. Though the fight sequences were a little strange. In the Geisha fight scene, the Major hangs too long in the air; then in the Bin-Man Puppet fight there are times when his movement through the air doesn't look right, it's as if the harness wasn't working right and they were pushed for time... The worst thing though is the streets. I don't mind that they are garishly lit, as this may be the case, it's the huge holographic people throughout. This wouldn't be too bad if you can figure out what they were selling but they just appear to be people doing... well, not much at all, really.Since the original films are still available I would strongly recommend you watch them instead of this. Even Innocence, which is the weakest of the series, is much stronger in story and characterisation. However, if you still haven't watched the original, why not? Find yourself a copy, it is a beautiful and intelligent movie. Something this should have been. I cannot understand why they did this to something that was so good, to begin with. Do they know that the saying isn't ""If it ain't broke... BREAK IT!"" Well, it goes to show that it doesn't matter how much money you throw at something... if the talent isn't there, or it isn't used to it's fullest potential, then you will usually get a pile of...","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Works as a spectacle, but will never justify its existence to die-hard fans of the original","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3845297/?ref_=tt_urv","tomgillespie2002","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3741220/?ref_=tt_urv","29 October 2017","Hollywood remakes of beloved foreign-language movies are rarely a welcome idea, but Ghost in the Shell seemed particularly doomed from the get-go. Alongside the cries from fans claiming the industry has officially run out of ideas, and from those who hold the original close to their heart and fail to see any other purpose in a remake other than to allow the fat cats to count the green, the announcement of Caucasian Scarlett Johnansson's casting in a role originally voiced by an Asian actor generated all-too familiar claims of 'whitewashing'. Tempers were only inflamed when it was rumoured that Johnasson's appearance was to be digitally-tweaked to make her appear more Eastern-looking, an idea that was quickly abandoned. Predictably, Ghost in the Shell arrived in cinemas back in March to underwhelming box-office.As a result, I approached Rupert Sanders' 2017 re-do with a sense of trepidation and caution, knowing full well that it would lack the philosophical musings of the Masaume Shirow manga the story originated from, and the big questions raised by Mamoru Oshii's landmark anime adaptation. After all, this is a blockbuster wannabe starring one of the most in-demand actresses around, so of course the makers will feel the need to dumb everything down to suit a mainstream audience (even though Christopher Nolan has proved more than once that a film can be complex and intelligent and still rake in the cash). It is perhaps thanks to my low expectations that I found much to enjoy with Ghost in the Shell. Like the 'shells' depicted in the film, it's certainly hollow and jittery, but as a piece of entertainment, I was never bored, and the visuals offer plenty of colour and detail to distract from the straightforward plot.Taking inspiration from everything from Shirow's manga, Oshii's 1995 movie and its 2004 sequel, and the hugely popular spin-off series, certain scenes will certainly feel familiar while the story of a shady corporation turning human beings into weapons against their will feels like it could be lifted from most Blade Runner-inspired science- fiction movies of the past couple of decades. Major (Johansson) is the first cyborg to employ a fully mechanised body with the mind, or 'ghost', of a human. Her employer, Hanka CEO Cutter (Peter Ferdinando), decides to use her in the fight against cyber-terrorism, which has become a real problem since the majority of the population have now been cybernetically enhanced. She works at Section 9 with her gruff partner Batou (a bleach-blonde Pilou Asbaek) and boss Aramaki ('Beat' Takeshi Kitano), and they are forced into action when Hanka finds itself under attack from a mysterious hacker named Kuze (Michael Pitt).Oshii's 1995 incarnation tackled big themes such as humanity and identity, offering explosive moments of action to allow some relief from the head-scratching central plot. The result was one of the best animes of all time. Sanders' Ghost in the Shell has much smaller ambitions, and feels very much like a product of the post- Matrix world we now live in, even though the Wachowskis were mainly inspired by Oshii's film. It works only as spectacle, and this world of spider-legged geisha robots and giant animated advertisements really does catch the eye. The action, while hardly breaking down barriers, has a physicality behind it, and the punches and bullets land with a force that really pushes its 12A certificate to the very limits. As the lead, Johansson has proved time and time again that she is accomplished with the physical demands of such a role, and she gives Major a hunched, stompy awkwardness, despite the blandness of the character. It will never justify its existence to the die- hard fans of the original, but Ghost in the Shell 2017 offers enough visual panache and energy to engage those curious enough to check it out.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

The story wasn't disjointed but the overall product was. Every time it approached an immersive experience it would lose it. It felt like watching a series of great scenes that added up to a cohesive story. I think the cast was amazing, the story was great, the visuals were awesome, and the scenes were great. They just didn't tie together the way they should have for the final product.

They don't exactly drop the title, but tell you what it's about. The best thing about this movie is probably how gorgeous it looks. I mean, these are some great special effects and we get beautiful visuals with everything looking so creative. We need futuristic stuff like this.The downsides are that it is in fact poorly paced. The length is good, but it's hard to get that good of a feel for the characters.

It may depart from the psychological aspect of some of the main series, which is fine because this is only a 2 hour movie and it was crammed instead with action and fluid plot. And conclusion. Very satisfying overall.If you come in with high hopes you'll be disappointed. Instead of picturing the movie YOU want, just enjoy it for what it is. A well executed, action packed part of the GitS franchise. Movies are meant to be experienced, not overly analyzed at the expense of fun.With the slew of, honestly, disgustingly bad films recently and to come, that have zero acting talent, poor script writing and plot as thin as the air of deep space, while still enjoying a massive Hollywood budget, I'd say give this a try.This movie makes me believe that Hollywood isn't utter junk yet.GitS is good.","64 out of 82 found this helpful.

I am not a 'super-fan', not some neck-beard Otaku who is upset that this was not a frame for frame remake of the original movie. I am not even particularly worried about the white-washing of the cast that so many other Americans are on about after watching so many Japanese people react to that feedback with a 'Why would that matter?' attitude.What upset me about this movie was the lack of subtlety and confidence that it has in it's audience. A big part of what made the original anime such a masterwork was that it didn't (clumsily) spoon-feed it's audience the world and the characters. Instead, it has enough faith in it's use of atmosphere, writing, and characters that it drops us into the story and lets world unfold at an exciting but natural pace. To make a point, what is the best performance in this remake? The subtle, confident, enigmatic leader of the team Aramaki, played wonderfully by Takeshi Kitano. Without formal introduction or overt character-building we have a compelling man that we can clearly understand is a tough, hard, and wise leader. All this with just a few minutes on screen and confidence in the story and the actor.I don't really fault the other actors in their roles, but the direction. It seemed like the more attention the director gave to a character, the more they felt the need to spell everything out a word at a time. Scarlett Johansson could play this role well if she was just allowed to play the confident, deadly, but lonely Major. Instead it seemed like she had someone behind the camera the entire time saying, 'The Americans will forget you're a robot if you don't keep reminding them! Be more ROBOT!' In the end, we have a movie that was a beautiful, but fairly ham-fisted reminder of how good a story can be when it's allowed to just be itself.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

What a great movie it was... in 1995...This new iteration has taken away EVERYTHING that was great in manga, movies and series... There is bad casting followed by bad acting. There is bad animation [ deep-dive scene?! wtf?! ] and bad writing... There was another proof that a background is more important than skill in the way #RupertSanders executed this production and by execution I mean slaughter, decapitation...None of the brilliant atmosphere is there, no consideration of sound as an integral part of the story, no attention to detail at all [ grave ]... It's just a sad, sad, westernised, washed away action movie with branding that probably costed more than that poor CGI.As a final stab-wound, we have one person speaking Japanese and a bit of soap opera at the end... Almost like it was made in UK...Both me, who grew up on the good-old stuff, and my friend who I introduced to the franchise recently through previous movies - left the cinema disappointed and wanting to re-watch the original.

And I have read much of the commentary both critical racial and political noise, which I will discuss later.Bottom line: this is a gorgeous movie that sticks faithfully to the universe. The actors, director and certainly the set/CG and costuming were all excellent. The first major scene in the Geisha house was amazing. I watched a second time simply because it was wonderful to look at.The story was a bit typical of these futuristic settings, whereas they feel they have to give the protagonist a way to discover their true self, despite the government or corporations or whatever. It's a pretty well worn path.However, it is also an acceptable one, given this movie was going to reach a larger audience.As far as the casting, yes, it would have made more sense to cast a Japanese actress. However, with an international star like Johansson the movie had a chance to make money and receive a proper budget. Right or wrong, it made sense, though many Japanese actresses could have rocked this part. I appreciate the conversation, but don't let it spoil the movie for you.That said, given their choice of Johansson, I don't know why they went with a futuristic Japanese setting. That's where things get a bit weird; most everyone is Japanese except Section 9? To be fair, the cartoons sort of go that way too. Though I wouldn't want to have missed that Geisha scene exactly as it was.I really enjoyed this movie.","20 out of 23 found this helpful.

One particular woman by the name of ""Mira Killian"" (Scarlett Johansson) is an exception as her brain has been successfully transplanted into a robotic creation that gives her incredible physical abilities. To that end, the company which created her has chosen to use these abilities to create a super-soldier which they maintain is for the purpose of killing terrorists. However, during one particular mission, she learns that everything she has been told has been a lie--and rather than have that knowledge compromised the company unleashes all of their resources against her. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film definitely had a lot of action and some really good computer graphics as well. Unfortunately, the action scenes moved much too quickly which created a little confusion at times on my part. Additionally, I thought that the characters could also have used a bit more development. Even so, despite the flaws just mentioned, I enjoyed this movie for the most part and because of that I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I enjoyed every second. I felt every emotion. I was amazed by every visual. I walked out of the cinema in awe. Then, I checked the IMDb page and was absolutely shocked to see it had a score of 6.9. This is a excellent example of why hype is a dangerous weapon, especially against adaptions or remakes. This really opened my eyes towards movie criticism and reviews. I urge everyone to do as I did more often, not give movies unrealistic expectations, and rip it to pieces when it disappoints you. Instead, put your preconceived notions behind you, appreciate the countless hours of work and incredible effort the filmmakers put in, and remember why we watch movies: to enjoy.","551 out of 785 found this helpful.

Anyone with half a brain should know making the original its impossible even in 2017. You are looking at a production employing thousands of people with high salaries that need to be paid. People expect the director to go total indie and create something philosophical and complex as the original without realizing that such movie 100% will fail with an American audience. Not disrespecting Americans but the society here is not even close where GITS stands. The social changes within the GITS world has gone way beyond what we are right now in USA. We are rather a backward xenophobic society (hence the whitewashing) and you want a Hollywood company to risk millions and create something that has aged beyond what we are at. Well its not going to happen. Have in mind the original is more like a cult movie in US. You go out and ask people nobody knows what GITS is. Its anime, its manga, and a certain group of (highly intelligent) diverse group of people are into those. Watching the GITS is like staring into a Crystal ball. It would take another 100 years for our society to understand its complex world full of details and hidden messages.Now the movie itself. Its a little gem. It starts slow. Seems like the makers of this movie were almost obsessive with the original environment and it looks amazing an faithful. The story is dumped down to a revenge story to sell and be understandable within our society. It hurts because such beautiful movie could've been so much if we actually could stick to the original script but as I said that is just impossible right now. It be me and 10 more people watching that production while rest of the country scratching their heads. The movie picks up after the introduction phase and becomes very powerful toward the end. Michael Pitt portrayal for Kuze is nothing short of amazing so if you are GITS fan you will start to like the movie from that point on.My advise is to look at this movie for what it is. The acting is superb and the environment is beautiful.

The movie had more color than it knew what to do with, and the dark was appropriately offset by the bright. No so with this live-action version, where everything is grayed out, drab and sterile. In this case, CGI (even higher-quality) is no replacement for '90s Japanese animation. It's just not a good-looking movie.Or involving for that matter. There's a stiffness to the whole thing (even the fight scenes) and Scarlett Johansson movies aren't usually this boring. Which is a good thing, but I can't see myself recommending this to anyone. It's awful.4/10","14 out of 45 found this helpful.

One of the chief purposes of live action is, theoretically, to add emotional weight to the lifeless 2D-animated characters, but Sanders's film botches that up spectacularly. Overall, Sanders's remake attempts to bridge the oceanic cultural disparities and ultimately, bears a grafted fruit that can barely appease either side.""-","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

There is no need to tell a long time fan something about this and it might even be impossible to write an accurate review for a fan. For someone who doesn't know the 90s anime or all the other stuff, comparisons doesn't matter anyway.This movie is set in a future where cyber enhancement has become the norm and this opens up the questions of ethics and moral. One of the questions is: What is real and what not? The body can be altered, even replaced, as can memories and personalities. What are the consequences of this possibilities?
The next question is: Where is the border between human and robot? What makes a human human? And at what point is a human no longer master of his own life?
This are quite philosophical questions and the movie can't give answers. It can only make the viewer think.One other question is: If companies control the technology, what rights do they have, and what power? Can they experiment with human bodies? Do they have the right to make decisions over this cyber enhanced humans?Today we are at the very beginning of this development. Making this questions a topic now is quite important. We asked them too late when other technology was introduced in the past. (Like when companies started to control our food or our medicine.)Some people complain about a movie that is set in Japan but has nearly no Asian actor in a major role. I don't know if that's important in an sci-fi, action movie, set in a future where all kinds of body modifications are possible. This movie was set up for a world wide audience and it doesn't change the story where the lead actor comes from. That's just the business side of the business. Maybe that's not good, but we all know that the name of the lead sells at least half of the tickets.Visually this movie is great. The acting is good, not great. The cast plays well. Johansson plays it cool or reserved. She played a robot with a human brain and no memory of the past. Her new life, the only life she knows, is that of an agent. The fact that the story doesn't tell all the details from the beginning equals the fact that the characters know very little themselves. They know little about the attacker, Major knows nothing about her past. And the fact that she was reconstructed as a weapon makes it hard for her to be emotional. She has to get used to be human. She sees herself as an outsider.
This is a movie with not many words. There are no characters who talk a lot. Well this is not Dawson's Creek, it's a Sci-fi setting with a military/police environment. It is not a thriller where the main character has to discover a complex secret. We don't need Sherlock holmes, the story unfolds by the actions of the attacker. The philosophical or moral questions are what's interesting, not the crimes.","28 out of 34 found this helpful.

It almost feels like it is entirely different. First of all, it doesn't have the philosopy the anime series has. That philosophy really amazed me when I first watched the original version. Secondly, the original version doesn't have the dramatic elements the film has. I believe that this film is not a good remake. But, on the other hand, I enjoyed this film too. The film is visiually really well-designed, in addition, this version of the story is also catchy enough, at least for me.

I do applaud the movie director Rupert Sanders and the writers Jamie Moss, William Wheeler, and Ehren Kruger, for having the balls to remake a anime into live action. A Ghost in the Shell is based on the Japanese manga of the same name by Masamune Shirow and it is not just any anime but one of the holy grails of anime. And thank God, it is as good as it is. Any anime/Manga film brought to life by an American production is scary. Translating Japanese philosophy to Western ideals on the big screen has been littered with awful, vomit pucking horrors-just the mere mention of the live action abomination Dragonball Z still is a shuddering thought.The 2017 live action films Ghost In The Shell stars Scarlett Johansson, Takeshi Kitano, Michael Pitt, Pilou Asbæk, Chin Han and Juliette Binoche,set in a near future when the line between humans and robots is blurring, the plot follows the Major (Johansson), a cyborg supersoldier who investigates her past.Now the The Good
** Visual: Visually this movie is stunning. Each frame of film is filled with visual delights that reminded me of the original film. 
** Costume: Costume design is almost as good as the Fifth Element. Very textual but mixed with edgy cyber-punk.
** Lighting: It is top notch lighting. from the opening shot to the street life and dark underworld
** Cinematography: Who ever is in charge of Cinematography should be awarded an oscar or at least a million dollars. This film has most spectacular cinematography to date, near duplicating Masamune Shirow original world of Ghost in the Shell.
** Production design: breathtaking comes to mind
** Sound Design: thumbs up!!!! listen to the creative mecca of sound poured thought the movie.
** Music: I really don't know if the original score is better or the live action score is above. But it does fit in this universe of Masamune Shirow. Upon watching the film a second time, I loved this score!!!
** Special Effects: Two words - BLOODY MAGNIFICENT!!!!
** Takeshi Kitano: legendary Japanese actor/director : can it get any better. Watch Hana-bai to appreciate his talent. Loved how he was the only character that spoke Japanese while other spoke English. Now the The Okay
** Scarlet Johansson: I couldn't give two rats if Major was an asian actress or not. Scarlet Johansson did what she could with the script. Many have trashed her performance and found her portrayal of Major dull and soulless. I, on the other hand, enjoyed her performance to some degree. There is a real sense of conflict and internal struggle when she notices thing in her past that are affecting the present. Overall I would rather Scarlet Johansson's Major any day over the Disney's Know-it-all Daisy Ridley portrayal of ""Rei"". 
** The Tone: Unlike many other films the tone of the film does not shift and remains the same. It not a good thing nor is it a bad thing. It would of been jarring if there was an overly sense of humour thorough the film like Guardians of the Galaxy.
** The Story: Very much like the original it was very linear and did not have any expected plot twists
** Pacing: I admit I did get a bit bored in the second act for about 10 minutes. I cannot pin point why. I can only put it to pacing.Now the Bad
** The Villain: very one dimensional character. Basically like any other corporate guy with a big ego and a hidden agenda. The secondary villain isn't all that omnipotent and god-like; more of a passing thought really.
** It's too clean!!!! It lacked the grittiness, slums and grime of the original film. It was just too clean with no garbage, rats running around, alley cats and dirt. It had a look of cleanliness (very much like Star Trek). I get it is not like the original animated movie,, but I found it a tad too sterile and not at all solid, down-to-earth and textual. Unlike many of the critics or reviewers, I did not delve too deeply into this film. I watched it with out any expectations. My best advise is to watch it. If you like then you like it. If you don't , then you don't. Have an open mind and have no expectations.","22 out of 26 found this helpful.

To be fair, in the original version of this, it probably would have been fresher, so this probably suffers due to the success of the original., and it being emulated since.

I haven't read the comics or seen the anime and I wish that I had because then I might have something more to say here. The hardest movies to review are mediocre ones because they don't inspire either positive or negative enthusiasm. I barely have the enthusiasm to acknowledge that I watched this movie let alone review the damn thing. But I'll give it a shot.This takes place in the future when robotics have advanced to the point where most humans are augmenting themselves with robotic parts. Scarlet Johansson plays a robot with a human brain and is a cop or counter-terrorist or military or something. I never exactly understood what she was supposed to be. Anyway, somebody is killing people that have something to do with how she was created, so she goes after them and starts learning more about where she came from. It's a very generic story where the hero with missing memories begins to assemble their history. Ever seen Robocop? Imagine that, but worse. Ever seen the Bourne movies? Well, I don't like those movies either, but this is Jason Bourne with robots. Kind of like Robocop. Except worse. I have heard many people say that a wooden performance from Scarlet Johansson is the main problem with this movie. I disagree. There isn't anything particularly great about her performance, but it isn't terrible. In that sense, her performance is a microcosm of the entire movie. I just never cared. I didn't even really understand what was happening until the last half hour or so. But I could never even give enough of a crap to be angry with it. The performances are boring, the plot is both generic and confusing (which is actually something of an accomplishment) and I just wanted it to end. I will say, though, that the production design is excellent. The massive city lit in neon with massive holograms is well-done, even though it reminded me of Blade Runner and made me wish I was watching that instead.Maybe I'm the wrong person to review this since I don't know anything about the source material. I would be curious what fans of the anime have to say about it. But if you know nothing about the source material, there is nothing notable here. Don't go to the theater for it; maybe watch it on Netflix if you are really bored. But for the love of god, watch Robocop or Blade Runner first if you haven't seen those classics. They cover this material in a far more memorable way.I try to make these reviews at least 500 words..but I've got nothing. Scarlet Johansson is really pretty. Did that get me to 500 words? Screw it. This movie sucks.","14 out of 46 found this helpful.

It has the name, it has the very basic shell of the original 1995 anime film 'Ghost in a shell' but leaves out Its ""ghost"". Its power/impact. Although I'm not against having S. Johansson play Major, the fact that the film leans heavily on Japanese culture makes it hard not to shout ""CULTURE APPROPRIATION!"" within the first 30 minutes of the film. Come on they have white/black actors/actresses playing Japanese named characters... Ghost in a shell lives in a world where the robots, its cities, its characters are all very Japanese. So its begs the question that if Hollywood are willing to use the Japanese cultures in its movies (clearly because it sells) then why aren't they willing to use Japanese actresses/actors for their movies?","17 out of 117 found this helpful.

As expected, things didn't reach so far into a philosophical sphere and at times spelling out the ""dilemmas of existence for dummies"" took a little from the atmosphere of the film.But, as far as bad things go, that's about it. CGI were mostly spot- on, only one or two scenes pulled me out of immersion. As a big plus, the film took some time to actually present the world itself without jumping to action. Side characters were great, I enjoyed Aramaki and Batou the most, Togusa, Saito and Ishikawa didn't have much screen time, but still delivered. Now, Johansson as the Major, I know a lot of fuss was there about whitewashing, I don't care about SJW thing, what matters to me if an actor/ess can act the role and IMO she was a great choice. In most scenes she behaved exactly like her character should, it didn't feel forced or overacted to me.And for the plot itself, I'm not saying it was fresh or never seen before thing, but it was a nice take and it brought something to the franchise. IDK if it makes official canon, but in my head it already is.I hope this review helps you, it is my first and I've done it because I feel that 6.9 stars is a lot less than this effort deserves.","633 out of 917 found this helpful.

There are plenty of new characters and additional background character modifications added that would make a lot of the anime purists cringe. Instead, the plot took a more traditional protagonist versus antagonist approach. However, if you think of the movie objectively, the plot is reasonable, the character development is good, the character's relationships between each other have also been maintained. Scarlett Johansson captures the essence of Major's personality incredibly well. The cinematography is also very good, with vibrant and LSD-hallucination-esque visuals and awesome choreography. All in all, its short-fall lay mainly in the fact that it very quickly became a generic action film which fell below the standard of the anime.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

You did decently with the animations and the digital aspect of all of this.You failed on story.
You acting was, meh.
You couldn't even find another English speaker to make it all English.Seriously, if you're going to make a film with English audio and a team that speaks English all working under a supervisor, that supervisor should SPEAK ENGLISH TOO. Don't have everyone speak English to him and he replies in Japanese. What the hell was that? I don't watch movies to read them, I watch movies to enjoy them.The acting was meh, wasn't hugely bad but wasn't hugely good either. If the other points weren't failures, this -might- have been possible to overlook.Lastly, the story. You changed up the whole story of Ghost in the Shell. Did the people who wrote this movie even watch the series and the previous movies? Why do people keep remaking things and changing up the whole story? I mean don't get me wrong, you came up with a semi-interesting story that was made bad due to trying to replace the original characters. You should have used another name for the movie, not just ""ghost in the shell"" but some other title after to indicate it isn't a base movie telling the story of the original movies. You shouldn't have tried to replace the characters that we know and love, instead make new characters with similar modifications. You want to make a new story, use new characters. Don't piss people off by reusing original characters and rewriting their history. You'll get a lot of bad reviews this way.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I still tried to go into it with a neutral mindset though.I think Scarlet Johansen did a very good job as the lead character, despite me having doubts about the casting (And not because she isn't Asian). She pulled it off, and most of the other characters were well cast as well.Aesthetically, the movie was well done but the sometimes overdone CGI effects prevented it from having a good cyberpunk ambiance. The giant ads all over the city in particular felt over the top.The story, as expected, was simplified from the original and felt as it was lacking depth. I also found the first half of the movie pretty boring but it picked up later on at least, and it had some scenes I liked very much. In general I found it to be a good movie, just not anywhere close to the anime movie. But fans of the anime or manga would probably still enjoy it if they do not have sky high expectations. For those who have read/seen neither, its probably worth watching as well.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I often agree with the criticism, but in relation to this iteration of Ghost In The Shell could not disagree more.The narrative is not as technically dense and philosophical as the original and diverges in some points. Notably the most emblematic scenes were masterfully re-created. The actor performances range from reasonable to decent, and the cinematography and visual architecture are breathtaking. Students of visual arts, graphic design, science fiction aficionados and alternative cinema lovers; trust me, this version of Ghost in The Shell is mandatory.Ghost in The Shell is not the original masterpiece, and has the disadvantage that the main theme is no longer a novelty. But it is a decent movie with exotic and wonderful visuals, endowed with a cyberpunk atmosphere that will not leave the lovers of the genre indifferent .. It is an action thriller painted with surreal neon tones. If you like science fiction and are fed up with the Marvel and Star Wars formula, take a look at this movie, maybe it's what you're looking for.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

While I personally think that for what the remake lacks in story, it makes up for it with its amazing visuals, gorgeous cinematography and some standout performances from the cast (particularly Takeshi Kitano as Daisuke Arakami). The visuals are great, the atmosphere is great, but I oddly thought that Scarlett Johansson's performance wasn't underwhelming because she wasn't Japanese like her character is meant to be, but because she kind of acts like a robot (no pun intended) at times during the movie.Rupert Sanders does a fantastic job at emulating Mamoru Oshii's directorial style, but he doesn't have the out-of-body direction that Oshii gave us with the original '95 classic. It's not that his directing skills are lackluster (far from it); it's that the script suffers from simplifying the original source material a little bit TOO much. There are some changes regarding the 'Puppet Master' here, but I don't really want to spill the beans here.Go into this movie for what it is: a Westernisation of an anime classic that for the most part works. And even when it does fall short of the original, it's actually an entertaining ride nonetheless. Give it a watch, and give it some much-needed love. God knows the film needs it considering freakin' Boss Baby is outdoing its box office!","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

You hear that Rupert Sanders, the guy behind Snow White and the Huntsman, is directing, you die a little inside. And keeping these two facts in mind, the film is actually pretty decent.I mean, let's face it, the film was never going to reach the philosophical and thematic depth of the original. Not without a huge name behind the camera. I'm talking about James Cameron level of talent here. So the fact that it looks great - the visuals are easily the best part of the film - sounds nice and has some genuinely good acting moments in it, is probably the most we were ever going to get. And that's exactly what was delivered here.But yeah, then the downsides. They do mess up with the story more than a little. Personally I'm okay with it as they're clearly trying to make the central theme and conflict - that of the value of humanity during the rise of cybernetics - more accessible to general audiences. And for the most part they succeed in this. But it does leave the story a bit lacking. Because such a huge part of the original was its depth. The fact that it quite honestly required a couple of viewings and some real thinking to get the message. That's simply not here.And while I do think that the acting in this film is okay for the most part - with Pilou Asbæk as Batou deserving the MVP trophy many times over - I was disappointed by Scarlett Johansson's Major. I blame the script for the most part, but the fact remains that her delivery and presence is about as flat as a piece of rice paper.Ghost in the Shell is worth a watch for fans of science fiction. It would be even for the visuals and practical effects alone, but it also has some good action, some good acting and even watered down the story ain't half bad.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

He remembers elements and gets a bunch of the details wrong and in general it doesn't make any sense. It's more or less hacked together from 3 different narratives.The problem with this is that out of the 3 main story lines they seem to have, non of them work properly because they're missing the beginning or end. We have the original story line with the end hacked off, then some second start missing story in the middle that isn't ended properly, then some random third story line limply stapled on the end. It would have made more sense to have either picked one or at least made it coherent.To get a similar effect, just get all the material on this franchise, pick random scenes, remove or change most of their relevance and you've basically got this film. There are characters there for no reason, there's background changes for no reason. The whole film just feels like it has no reason to be based on the material they didn't even use.Even if you're not a fan of the series, the plot isn't very good and quite nonsensical. They seem to rely on you having knowledge of the material, but then change things anyway. So both fans of the material and newcomers don't really have much clue. But OK, the plot sucks, there must be something about this that makes it worthy of glowing praise some people feel it deserves?, right? Not really. The action is kind of boring and poorly choreographed, and is just generic police show level material for the most part, or badly done redos. Scarlett Johansson isn't very believable in this role and looks kind of awkward and not very believable or impactful. the acting is wooden and mostly terrible. It's like b movie level if that. The main actress gets lots of screen time, but just seems really bored, though that's her thing. The casting is mostly forgettable. There was the slightly odd decision to have one character speaking Japanese while everyone understood and responded to him in English. Which was only odd because it made it hard to assume everyone else was just was in Japan speaking Japanese, unless everyone in Japan but him speaks English now? Who really knows!The dialog is poorly written and kind of insultingly simple. You'll have an already simplified concept explained to you, then explained to you again by someone else, and then again like we're all little babies that can't grasp anything by our little own selves. I'm not sure the target audience for this but i'm guessing it wasn't 5 year old children. People who claim it is ""though provoking"" do look a bit silly, as PeeWee's playhouse is more challenging.There are far too many scenes of filler nonsense (in a not very long film). Mostly of Scarlett Johansson staring at things looking bored. She stares emotionless a bunch for no reason too many times or just does things that makes no sense to her character. Maybe they just filmed her in her lunch break and then used it to pad out the film, who knows.In all the film just felt really lazy. There was little care taken in any single aspect of the production, from the designs that made no sense and had no solidness or grounding to them, to the bizarre city of weird holograms for no reason. Or the disparate story lines not properly explained and the insertion of random other story lines for no reason. Non of it has any relation to anything else and feels really superficial and disjointed.But is the film enjoyable? Not really. It doesn't serve a purpose as a mindless action film (the action is bland) or a thought provoking film (the dialog is idiot level simplified) or even a good coherent story.Like I said, I did think one of the main characters looked really like Kiefer Sutherland from Lost Boys at one point. That was probably the best part of the film.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Overall I recommend seeing it in the cinema because only in the cinema you can get the whole experience of the visual effects and music.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

Where is it? Unless you've seen the anime (I haven't) it's very unclear who she is, exactly who she is working for and why she is doing what she is doing (which is what, again?) There are a lot of regular characters in this movie and none of them received any substantial character development--so little, in fact that I hardly know any of their names. The setting is even less developed. It's not even clear where/when the movie takes place. I assume some future Japan but I don't even think they bothered to give the name of the city much less explain who they are fighting against and why they are fighting them.2) The movie fails to pay anything more than lip service to the concept of...is she human? Is she a robot? That would have been a compelling area to explore. The movie almost completely glosses over it and overall the plot is very shallow.3) The CGI. There is good CGI bad CGI and Ghost-in-the-Shell CGI which is undoubtedly the worse. The textures look so unrealistic it's jarring to seem them imposed on live action scenes and the movie is oversaturated with it to the extent it detracts from most moments in the film. The physics are way, way off which greatly diminishes the impact of the action scenes. It's difficult to sell a fight scene when the characters move completely unnaturally and appear as though they are weightless. It seems that either:A) They used decades old CGI techniques which wouldn't hold up back in 1998. B) They hired a cheap studio for the CGI which has little skill with it. C) They hired people to do the CGI that have no prior relevant experience a la Mass Effect Andromeda.People who are suggesting the visual effects alone are worth seeing the movie for clearly saw a different version of the film than I did.4) Dialogue and acting. It's not very good. Scarlett Johansson comes off as a human trying to move like a robot and in an extremely unconvincing manner. This is a shame because I think she is a fairly talented actress. I will chalk this up to directing because they definitely should not have gone with the shots they did. If it didn't work and she wasn't up to the task, have her act all human-y instead.In any case: Poor direction, poor acting, poor dialogue, poor plot and horrific CGI. If movie standards were building codes, this movie should be condemned.","30 out of 124 found this helpful.

If there was anything that this movie did well, it was successfully merging the dazzling futuristic visual aesthetics with the gritty and dark undertone of detective noir. I hadn't seen any film hit the cyberpunk nail so finely on the head since the first time I'd seen Blade Runner. Mix that with a surprisingly good soundtrack, and I'll give the setting of this movie a solid 10/10.The movie is not perfect though. It did suffer from having a cookie-cutter plot (secret agent, has no memory about her past, sets out to find her identity) and the action was mediocre. You can tell the writers wanted to play with deep existential themes, but didn't really have the courage to risk being too hard for the masses to understand. So they tried to play it safe and just make it a good action flick, but even that fell short. The action scenes start to go stale towards the end, and the movie sort of plateaus after the initial excitement.If you are a fan of the original 1995 film, you will likely not be disappointed. Sure, they did change the story around for a broader audience, but it fits. The original anime, although a masterpiece in its own right, was very dialogue heavy and slow paced. Rupert Sanders took the liberty of westernizing the story a bit, but still included some fan service (some shots and lines taken directly from the original) so that fans could still see their favorite anime movie come to life. I've been seeing a lot of backlash and criticism from the die hard fans, saying that this film is a ""dumbed down"" version of the original. I'm not going to deny that claim, but if you could watch a live action exact replica of the 1995 anime, would you really want to?Overall, the film is entertaining and certainly deserves a watch. I was satisfied, and so was my girlfriend who knew nothing about GITS before going into the theater. At the very least, I see this movie becoming a cult classic of the cyberpunk genre, and heck, it was better than Johnny Mnemonic.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The reason is because this movie had everything that could have made it a great adaptation. The visuals are phenomenal, the actors/actresses were spot on, and the action scenes was enjoyable to watch, so why don't I like it? Well, it is because the writing is utter garbage.One thing I noticed was that the main antagonist of the film wasn't The Puppet Master, but Kuze, from SAC: 2nd Gig. Kuze, however, has remnants of the Puppet Master, which confused me. I ended up finding out that the Kuze in this film was the combination of three well-established antagonists in the GiTS franchise molded into one (The Puppet Master, The Laughing Man, and Hideo Kuze). I am not sure whose bright idea it was to mesh these three characters together into one, but his did nothing but create an inconsistent antagonist that felt empty when given nothing more than some bland revenge story to go by. Even the major's story was pretty bad, given nothing to latch onto and hope she succeeds in her journey. Her issue was that we are given no time to understand or sympathize with her and are only told her story instead of shown.Another thing that bothered me was how forced and clunky the line delivery is for most of the movie. Hollywood starts to anger me off when it thinks its audience are a bunch of idiots who believe they must be spoon-fed every line of dialogue/exposition because they believe we aren't smart enough to understand complex ideas/themes. It is painful as all hell to have to be told everything about this movie without leaving things up to our interpretation, which was something I enjoyed in the 1995 version of GiTS. The complexity of the themes had been watered down so heavily by the bad writing that it is literally just shapes and colors.For the positives: The visuals were gorgeous, the actor/actresses performed and understood the characters very well, and the action scenes served to make the movie thrilling to watch.Overall, Hollywood needs to work on writing better scripts. They can make movies look good, but they don't give them any substance. I wanted to like this movie, knowing how much work was put into it just by watching it, it honestly shouldn't have been as bad as it was. But having incompatible ideas from previous work of the franchise, Kuze being a mesh of three already known antagonists from other GiTS stories, artificial and clunky delivery of dialogue/exposition, and the overall generic and predictable plot that Hollywood always churns up, this movie just couldn't reach its full potential.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

In my view as a huge fan of an animation movie of this, it was pretty good. It was severely criticized much though.
The story was also good as a kind of styles what was a good role setting and the worldview, not as a remake work.
Although a plot was different by the animation at all, it was showed everyone as easy as possible I think. But I didn't feel it was cheap,I was suprised by good job for explanation that such a difficult setting could be showed with one movie anyway.
A story went on well without leaving people who watched it for the first time. Probably, it's never going to work that way in the animation version.
Unfortunately, I don't think that it makes people who don't know the original excited particularly as one of Sci-Fi movies. I just hope that it leads more many people to have their interest in the animation and the original comic.By the way, please put Japanese subtitle on Mr.Aramaki!

Why didn't you just buy the rights to distribute the original in it's foreign language, with subtitles?, I want to ask. Are Americans insulted by the assumption that they're too stupid or egocentric to do subtitles? As I write this, I realise there are times when I'm on Hollywood's side, that I get where they're coming from. Sometimes, it makes sense to digest a culturally alien product and realise it for a different audience. It isn't always just the subtitles that serve as a barrier to comprehension. Now a confession. If I haven't already alienated you, dear reader, I may be about to, when I say I hate Anime. With a passion. It's not the ideas, which are frequently astonishing in their originality. Nor is it the story-telling; I've seen a few fans of the original GHost in the Shell admitting the long prognostications on the nature of humanity and such might be a bit much for a Hollywood audience to tolerate. That didn't put me off watching the Anime original. No, it was the animation style. I just hate it, pure and simple, with no reason other than innate prejudice against that particular form of artistic expression. It's not that I hate all animation, just Anime, and of course Manga, from which it is derived. Give me Aardman, Pixar (though not all) or The Simpsons any day. I'm sure I can't be the only one. The characters are drawn in such a way that they seem to convey an overly inflated sense of mawkish sentimentality. Anyway, moving on, that in a nutshell is why I was happy to see Hollywood attempt its own version. As sci-fi action goes, and I watch a lot, it's decently crafted from the point of view of acting performances (Scarlet Johansson moved in a subtly peculiar way suggestive of robotics, for example), set design (the cityscapes look superb) and story pacing. There are a few weak moments in use of CGI, but on the whole the effects are suitably special. The themes which dominate the story - the dangers of cyberspace and the aforementioned question of what it is to be human - are blended nicely with the action, which is rarely dumb or visually clumsy in its execution. Speaking of execution, ""Beat"" Takeshi was perhaps a nod to the sceptical Asian market, and initially seemed a bit muted, but his character blossomed like one of those crazed psychopaths he used to play so well, a sort of Daddy Violent Cop. Marvellous. One aspect I did find a little jarring was the everywhere-and- nowhere city. It felt like there may have been some difficulties in the birth of this film, such that instead of being set in Japan, or in America, it ended up being set in some mishmash that was neither one nor the other. Bladerunner-lite, if you will. This could have been used to advantage to convey a sense of displacement and unease reflective of the conflict between the real world and the digital, but ultimately it didn't really fit. The casting of the unmistakably white Scarlet Johansson in the lead (Japanese) role upset a lot of fans of the original film, but in reality the film would never have got made in Hollywood with a Japanese actress in the lead role, and in any case I thought the way that particular problem was reconciled in the plot worked perfectly well. In short, Ghost in the Shell is a solidly made sci-fi action film of which greatness should not be expected, but if you watch it without prejudice or those pesky great expectations, it will more than likely prove enjoyable and ever so slightly thought-provoking.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The blurb sounded quite interesting and the trailers were promising even though I always take trailers with a huge pinch of salt. I have never read the original Manga. Whether that is good or bad with respect to the movie I do not know.The good stuff as far as this movie is concerned is, not surprisingly, the visuals. I would not say that they are stunning but the are quite good. The environments are interesting and the special effects are not bad at all. I have to say that the tank design was pretty poor though. Not very exiting as a fictional design and utter nonsense from a functional point of view.This is as far as the good stuff goes. The story is okay but it is pretty predictable and not that much to get exited about. It could have been more developed for sure. I would actually have liked to see the Major do a few more missions beating up the bad guys. That was where the movie shined a bit and showed the best visuals and special effects.The acting is pretty mediocre to be honest. Even Daisuke Aramaki, which was a character that I did like, felt rather bland. The main bad guy was just a uninspiring thug.To me the movie more or less felt like the pilote episode of a TV- show with a huge budget for visuals. It was not WOW god but showed promise and I felt like I would like to see more ""episodes"". The fact that it is actually a movie and it seems unlikely that a sequel, even though the ending makes it pretty clear that they hoped there would be one, will be made left me with a unsatisfied feeling.Bottom line, average movie with enjoyable visuals and special effects but one which do not manage to reach above the ""just another sci-fi manga movie"" segment for me.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

'Ghost in the Shell' has all of the psychological and intellectual depth of a fresh pool of urine emptied from a dwarf's bladder. The film is set in Tokyo, yet almost everyone is an American Caucasian, which is hilarious and easily the most entertaining aspect of the film (no country knows how to insult other countries like America does). 'The Matrix' was an unofficial live action adaptation of the 1995 original anime feature, and it was a really creative, clever and innovative film (everything that this film is not), so why was this remake even necessary? The reason why, of course, is because they are completely out of ideas in America yet they want to continue making billions of dollars regardless, so they butcher both the creative films of the past and those of other countries.If there is anything positive I can say about the film's existence, it's that it may inspire people to check out the great original -- but even that is dated in 2017, post-Matrix, and wouldn't have the same impact of seeing it in the era of premillennial anxiety that was the 1990s when everyone was terrified of technological advancement (now we all just submit to it like hostages, we don't care). Maybe, however, it has came all the way around again and in this era, which is a different world, people will interpret the film in a new way, recognising how technology makes them feel cold and isolated, less than human. Also there were some visually impressive shots (all taken from the anime, of course, why bother with any originality).The title is an ironic metaphor for Hollywood itself -- Hollywood is a cold, capitalistic machine that once had a soul (albeit a very indulgent and self-absorbed one, yet it had a trace of self-awareness to it), and now all it has left is a deceased ghost memory stumbling around inside its metal prison, running out of ideas.

"7","/10","Visually stunning, story lacking, still a good film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3681633/?ref_=tt_urv","jackmeat","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0633574/?ref_=tt_urv","9 April 2017","My quick rating - 7,1/10. There will be two types of reviewers for this movie. Those die hard fans of the original anime, and those that have not seen the anime and watch this film stand alone. As someone who has seen the anime, and loved it, I am going to try and teeter between the two views as best as I can. I will just get something out of the way: When great Animes came out 20 or so years ago, such as this, and Akira to name the two that come to mind quickly, there was a general consensus that there was no way that a movie could be intricate enough to capture the vivid and detailed world that was created in these masterpieces. Special effects were not there....yet. Jump to now, where the strides in tech have made capturing these vivid worlds a possibility and this movie did so perfectly. The dark and decaying world shows bright and vivid, with all the contrast as it should. Even with the somewhat bizarre building size holographic billboards that seem out of place at times (as big as Godzilla strolling through central park for no reason) that are selling something? Maybe? Anyway, this movie is a marvel to look at, and is no doubt going to win Oscars for visuals. Unbelievable to look at. So if you hear, see it in a theater (i chose IMAX, and glad I did) there is truth to this. The REALLY big screen is needed to take it all in.So now the story. Quick sum up, the future has no issues with replacing body parts with enhanced robotic parts. Well, the story is the main character, Major (Scarlett Johansson) is the first to take the human brain and be put into a fully robotic body, enhanced to be a super soldier. Now if this sounds like Universal Soldier, I suppose there are some parallels to it, but they are nothing alike. This is actually a story about identity, which is an important word to remember when viewing this. All the things that make us human, and keeps us different from AI is a part of the struggle here. This is the part that I will step over to being a fan of the anime. Many of these themes that were alluded to and gave the viewer things to ponder are just kinda swept away from this Hollywood product. This movie had to be ""dummy'd down"" if you will to make it a bit more mainstream. I didn't see this as a problem per se, but I am sure some fans are slightly perturbed by some of the omissions that occur. No details since that would be spoiler territory.It would be difficult not to be in awe of the action sequences as well. They are so wonderfully shot and edited so they never lose your attention by moving to fast, and allow the audience to just take the sequences in. Just a really good job sine lately the massive cut-cut editing in action scenes leave you wondering what is going on. Not in this film.So, with some incredible things to look at, and a script that leaves some to be desired, the other element is the acting. Well, all that gets from me is adequate. Can't say much more. The emotions in Majors eyes are really what you are supposed to get the feelings from and this is done just fine really. Not distracting nor great. The other characters are fine, and Batou was probably the best when it comes to acting in the movie. And they did do a good job with the iconic eyes of Batou as well, for all the fans out there. All that said, is the movie perfect, and everything us fans wanted? Nope. Never was going to be no matter who made it. But Hollywood didn't destroy the classic either thankfully, and gave us all something to sit and allow our jaws to drop at, and listen to (yes, some of the original score from the anime is even in place for your listening pleasure). Definitely a good film worth watching that most likely will be taken out of context by both audiences I described since it is right in the middle of what it is and what it could have been. I left satisfied and that is good enough for me.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I really enjoyed being in this world and with the main two characters. However the film suffers from story issues and plot holes which unfortunately were always going to be dumbed down for a lower rating compared with its original source material. The problems are more in the second half of the film and it feels anti climatic in the end. The film always had the problem of being tied to its source material when in some instances it would of been better for it to veer away from it to suit live action. There are good performances by the two leads and I was engaged in their relationship together as a partnership. it would be good to see a future film with them exploring a different story line in this universe, but depending on the commercial success of this film that may never happen.I recommend this film to science fiction and action film fans, there are however films with similar themes that are much better such as Blade Runner (1982), Robocop (1987), and Terminator 2 Judgment Day (1991)","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

but I have to say as a movie on its own the movie was very very enjoyable and it was a visual treat. The effects were very well done and the movie was very fun to watch, it was a very beautiful movie. the Cast is great and i really loved the characters and i loved their performances, I loved the style of the movie and i loved the effects on the city in live action and i love the action scenes and I think they did a great job at depicting this futuristic setting and these characters. 
The story is pretty simple and not as great or as thick as in the anime but for it was I thought it was an excellent movie. I did not have a problem with the changes because this movie was made to capture a bigger audience and for more people to watch.

The actor's are well chosen and perform well.As per the title of my review, it feels a little like a 2017 homage to Blade Runner, style wise it is heavily influenced and did we actually know if Harrison Ford was a Cyborg Cop? If you are also familiar with Mirrors Edge the game, you will also see it in the movie ( I can't say more as it will be a spoiler).Scarlett Johansson seems to have turned into a modern day Nicholas Cage, picking roles that make her either super intelligent or having super powers, her ego is getting a little thin on me now and I am no longer lusting over her as I once did.Minor gripe aside, its worth a watch, it's in the same league as her film Lucy, watch it once, nod your head once in appreciation and not plan to watch it a second time.

But, on the other hand, Blade Runner had a seamy, grimy underbelly that lent realism to the otherwordly pastiche. This thing is shiny and shallow.I remember seeing Scarlet Johannsson in Ghost World, great small release film from 2001, and thinking she's a nice actress who should be interesting to watch. Fast forward to now, she has had tremendous high profile, big budget success, but that's not always such a great thing. Watching her sleepwalk through the endless Marvel drivel prepared me for her self consciously robotic take on her role in this film. And yes, I am aware of criticizing her portrayal of an android as robotic seems silly, but being enigmatic gets extremely tedious with no other even mildly interesting other characters to play off. She's dangerously close to sharing stereotype status with Mila Jovovich and Charlize Theron-futuristic badass, invincible babes who routinely dispatch trained male assassins twice their size with minimal exertion. It's BORING.The film itself is a CGI mess, and even after the film was over, I had no clue what the motivation or purpose of any of it was. I think you could probably make 10 interesting films on the budget of this pointless piece of dreck.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Yet I was pleasantly surprised to be hooked quickly and found even the end satisfying which is not that common for me. I understand there was some backlash with the casting of Scarlett Johansson in the lead instead of an Asian actress since the story is based on anime but I have to say she really owns the part and made me care which is always the bottom line. I loved the chemistry between her and Pilou Asbaek as Patou with strong performances as well by Juliette Binoche and Michael Pitt as Kuze among a very competent cast.Yes we've seen most of those plot lines in other movies before and yes the special effects are commonly well rendered these days with a ton of superhero movies setting the bar high yet, I was really surprised at just how much I enjoyed it and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good time while letting the suspension of disbelief work its magic. 9 stars from me and the only reason why this didn't get a 10 is because there were a couple of moments that I wish would have gone differently story wise but this is above average science fiction in my book.","25 out of 31 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Dulled Down High Concept, but still Enjoyable Action Sci-fi","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3678886/?ref_=tt_urv","PyroSikTh","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5261700/?ref_=tt_urv","5 April 2017","Major is a breakthrough in cybernetics, in a futuristic world where cybernetic enhancements are commonplace. Humans and robots are often indistinguishable due to the over-enhancements many humans have, and the life-like resemblance of robots. Major though, as said, is a breakthrough in that field, being the first successful marriage of human brain and entirely cybernetic body. The company she was made for regards her a weapon, and she lacks any memory of her previous life before the incident, beyond a few meaningless 'glitches' she suffers. Her latest assignment has her on the tail of a cybernetic terrorist who's attacking her company's scientists and is proving particularly difficult to find.While Ghost in the Shell ends up being a fairly regular tale of stolen identity, as Major slowly begins to uncover who she was before, there are subtle references to something deeper. The lines between man and machine are well and truly blurred, and while the movie doesn't make a big point of it, it certainly flirts with the idea. For instance, they catch an accomplice and in the interrogation learn that he's had his mind wiped and false memories installed remotely. His brain has been, quite literally, hacked from an outside source. He's human, but his brain is a machine like any CPU, just made of organic matter rather than wiring.My biggest complaint about Ghost in the Shell though is that these ideas are only hinted at and flirted with. They're never given much focus or developed much. Even in the movie we got, I could tell there was more between scenes that had been cut for whatever reason. Major has a tender moment with a prostitute, touching and examining her face, but it's never given much weight and is never touched upon again. When Major goes to investigate her past, a nice elder lady just lets her into her home and offers her tea without cause or reason to. She's apprehended by the company, but she doesn't put up any kind of fight and just lets them take her. In each of these instances it feels like there was more there, more motive, development and reason behind what we see, but are never shown. As such, the movie feels like it's over as soon as it's started. The big climax at the end feels less like a climax and more as build-up to the climax, giving the end a little bit of an unsatisfactory edge.Visually, Ghost in the Shell is top-notch, full of lots of little details that bring the world to life. It does a great job of not just presenting a futuristic world, but offering a particular view of a futuristic world. It mirrors sci-fi movies from the 80s and 90s, and what their view of the future was, more than ours. For instance all the cars are modded sports cars from the 80s and 90s, like you would see in those kinds of movies back then. Even fashions and hairstyles have that almost future-90s look. In this regard, I can only assume that Ghost in the Shell is at least very visually faithful to the original, while also looking good enough for modern audiences. Despite the deliberately dated aesthetic, I definitely got a whiff of the Total Recall and Robocop remakes in it's presentation.Of course the quality is thousand-fold. The cityscapes are breathtaking, full of imaginative, holographic advertisements jumping out from buildings and walls, roads are interconnected highways full of 'futuristic' looking cars, and the robotics themselves are perfection of design and execution. WETA did a great job in creating animatronics for much of the robotics, to give them a truly robotic appearance rather than just falling back on CGI, and Ghost in the Shell's visual quality benefits from this greatly.The music deserves mention as well. Clint Mansell's score is deep and rich in sonic quality, giving the film's music it's own identity. He manages to blend typical orchestration effortlessly with sweeping synths and booming sub-bass that feels both typical and new. I'm genuinely quite disappointed I can't find the score anywhere to re-live. The soundtrack contains various similarly electronic tracks as well though, including a remix of the original theme into dubstep. Not sure I'm a fan of it, but I'm not sure I particularly like the original theme either. Tricky, DJ Shadow, and Gary Numan offer great subtle tracks though (although I can't particularly place them in the movie).Ghost in the Shell is a worthy addition to Hollywood's latest crop of sci-fi remakes. While this is absolutely an unpopular opinion, I've enjoyed almost all of them, and Ghost in the Shell is no different. My biggest criticism is simply that it was too short. There's so much going on that some of the more interesting elements got left behind in favour of a tighter run time, and this does hurt it a little bit. I give Ghost in the Shell an enjoyable, but unrevolutionary 7/10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

However the writing is poor making the film unwatchable. It's full of clichés typical to the 'Anglosphere' (to use a William Gibson's neologism.) The person who wrote it clearly never stepped out of their culture, never lived in a foreign country or learned to speak another language. It's a look at the mind of a typical brexit voter's heuristic vocabulary. It's horrible to be frank.
The writer doesn't respect the source material, he treats it as if it would be a Superman comic book story. He doesn't understand the struggle of the main character Motoko who is coping with trauma induced by firstly losing her body in a plane crash as a child and then having to swap between bodies while growing up. In the TV series for example she describes the experience of crushing a doll she held dear because of having poor motor control of the new artificial body. You can relate to the character's experience.
Also the relationship between the Section 9 characters is wrong. She is the leader of the team, she gives orders. The other characters (apart from Aramaki) are her subordinates. While there's a lot of fooling around there's a strict hierarchy and work relationship here. 'Major' is a military/police rank. She's a team leader.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

I am also a fan of the anime however unlike most of them who left a negative review I also like this movie. Hollywood made alot of effort and spent alot on this movie. It's loyal to the source material and it's obviously a joint US and Japanese production. Sadly there are people who really believe that they are smarter than everyone else because they watch anime with subtitles and who pretend to understand things which are actually deliberately opaque. This movie being in English actually exposes the fact that the source material simply isn't that great, it's just okay. It also fails that it simply doesn't make much sense. Having it stripped of the mysticism which comes with being in a foreign language lays bare the actual storyline which is simply not that groundbreaking or deep and that seems to be behind the fanboy rage. You see that cool anime film only they think they know about? Well now everyone does and because it's mainstream they no longer like it. This movie looks fantastic and is true to the anime so its as good a version of GITS live action there is ever likely to be. Ghost was only ever a 6 out 10 story possibly a five but this is far clearer than trying to read badly translated subtitles. Enjoy it for what it is and don't listen to the fanboys who are complaining about what they think it isn't. Funnily enough most of them aren't even Japanese.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Johansson is a great badass leading lady as usual. She does the job she's supposed to with aplomb. Asbaek is great as Batou, giving you a perfectly likable oddball character to play off ""Major"". Kitano plays Aramaki as a an awesome old badass and nails it.Then there's the visuals, which everyone covered. Awesome, very awesome. A world of giant holograms everywhere, crazy cyborgs, overcrowded Japanese cities, and on and on all brought to life with (almost) entirely solid CGI. Batou even drives a semifuture Delorean, awesome!And then, you get to the story. The good news here is that the American adaptation here wants to have the kind of brains and examination of humanity and its relationship with technology that the original movie and then series did. It very, very much WANTS to, but it doesn't. And that's because the plot is disorganized mess of trying to stick in old GITS story lines, be a Hollywood blockbuster, be smarter than a Hollywood blockbuster, and about a half dozen other things as well.In other words its a mess. Not a mess that isn't followable, it perfectly well is. But it's a mess in that it doesn't know what it's trying to do or what its overall goal is. The bad guy is, Kuze.. who uhm. His goal is too... uhhh. Destroy a robotics company, sorta, a bit? And the main characters care about this... sort of, like tangentially. Because it's their job too mostly? Also there's a bunch of comparisons to the first anime GITS movie and the bad guy there, but it's just kind of there to be... there?And then it turns out the real bad guy is the corporate asshole from the beginning. Whos personality can be summed up as ""evil asshole that will get shot or something"" and then he gets shot. And his plan was too... uhm. Hmmm. Be, an asshole to everyone? Cause that's all he really does throughout the entire movie, whether it makes sense or not.Also by the end Kuze, the initial bad guy, dies but doesn't. And no one ends up caring where he goes or what he was doing throughout the first 2/3rds of the movie even though that's what a lot of the movie was about. Because... uhhhhh. Well I don't know and the plot sure doesn't, the movie just kind of ends. And what a downer that is. Some people, the concept artists, the cast, the VFX team, all feel like they worked really hard on this movie and nailed there parts in what could have been a great translation of GITS into live action.

Brilliant cinematography, story immersion and a top notch performance by Scarlett Johansson et al. The set design is just perfect and everything feels like Tokyo 2050. This movie is a prime example of the dangers of public consensus. From its inception, Ghost in The Shell was hampered and criticized for being a ""white washed"" adaptation.

The guy cast as Batou stole every scene he was in. And visually, it gave us all the touch points we've been seeing for two decades.The story... they were too busy trying to mash together 20 years of stories into one movie. They had the Puppet Master, Laughing Man and Individual Eleven story lines in one room, tossed in some Robocop and then put turned on the autotune. As a result, it was trying really hard but never quite got there. They could have done better coming up with a new story rather than this hybrid.I do think that Ms Scarlett wasn't the right person. She doesn't have the chops to carry a GitS storyline, which by nature should be complex and more than a little deep. When compounded by the weak script.. Yeah. She never played the Major, she did a hybrid of Faye Valentine from Cowboy Bebop and Natasha Romanov.So all that said, it was not a waste of time watching it. It was very pretty. Very pretty. They built the shell. But they didn't find the ghost until the very, very end. And even when they did, it didn't speak to us.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I'm writing here because, somehow, there are already 34 baseless reviews from people who haven't seen the film. I registered immediately to rectify that situation.I was truly concerned that this movie wouldn't satisfy me as a fan. Even though the accusations of whitewashing were baseless to begin with, I was concerned that they may have westernized or washed out some of the GITS flavour that I know and love. To me, this film was fantastic. I went in expecting to be disappointed and I came out grinning ear to ear. I laughed as I watched Aramaki be a down right bad ass. The relationship between Major and Batou was freakin' spot on. There's a lot of philosophy to represent, and that's not easy to do in a movie designed to capture and keep attention, but they did it. The fan service was brilliant and I loved it. It was visually stunning. The soundtrack was wonderful. Scarjo was an excellent study of the Major. It was not tacky or cliché at all. Please, do not listen to the inevitable vapid borderline insulting ""critiques"" that you'll no doubt uncover by the various news media who were targeted with pumping out a review for a movie they genuinely don't give two shits about. This movie won't be for everyone. It's scifi. It's intellectual. It's not everyone's cup of tea. But it's good. It's a classic. And I, for one, am genuinely gratified and impressed. Good work.","857 out of 1,297 found this helpful.

In Ghost in the Shell characters don't manage to reveal, history too trivial and boring. The world around is registered not up to the end. A lot of things stay behind scenes.

This doesn't come close to the coherence of plot and theme-development of the first movie.

This must be one of the most visually stunning films I've seen in recent years. From a technical standpoint there is not a flaw in all of 107 minutes (except one tiny scene where Major jumps up a crumbling structure during a final showdown, which looks like amateur CGI homework). I didn't even mind the somewhat flat, trope-ridden plot, because the action kept me entertained enough. I did, however, have two issues with Ghost in the Shell that still annoy me.1. I understand that Scarlett Johansson is supposed to portray cybernetic hybrid, but she was dead-faced the entire time. Even the completely robotic geishas in the film moved more natural and emoted more than her. The way she walked and stuck out her neck was just odd. And that dead stare! Major has a human brain, and therefore she is capable of the same emotions as you and me. Why did Johansson choose to take her character into that boring territory is beyond me. It's hard to watch. I would have written it off as an odd stylistic decision on the part of director or the actress, but she does this every time she has to play a tough heroine (ie. Black Widow, Lucy). Someone tell Scarlett that she comes off as bored and awkward, not tough.2. My other gripe is the PG-13 rating. Honestly, I felt like the writers and the director wished to make a more mature film, but the studio forced them to change it. There are multiple scenes that feel like they were designed to be R-rated, but were cut up and edited to appeal to a wider audience. There are hints all over the place that make you wish the movie would just stop playing coy and go further. I'm hoping there will be a director's cut released in the future that would breach into a darker territory. The Ghost is a fine action flick, well worth watching on a big screen. Would I enjoy it as much on Netflix? Probably not.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

In a few more words: The bad: That the philosophy would get dumbed down isn't surprising. But there's still boatloads more in here than in, say, the Matrix (and people praised THAT for this aspect), so we shouldn't be overly harsh. Johannson's acting is what it always is - shaky at best. For me she doesn't fit the role - neither her overly emotional approach, nor physically. No, I don't care she's not Asian. None of the characters in the anime - save for Aramaki and maybe Saito - look Asian, either. The story of GITS, for me, has always been about stone cold professionals on the edge of their respective fields - with all the sacrifices that are made in order to stay on top taken to an extreme. She does not portray this believably (much like she fails to do so in her other 'superhuman' roles like in the Avengers franchise). She's the pretty-face A-lister du jour in Hollywood that puts bums in seats and that's the long and short of why she's in the movie. The dialogue could have been better but it serves well enough as an introduction for people new to GITS. Surprisingly the worst performance comes from Juliet Binoche.The good: The techno environment is captured perfectly. Many scenes (down to some 'filler' atmospheric shots) have been lovingly taken from the anime movies/series and recreated in detail. It's only one of two movies where I'd say the 3D actually adds to the feel of it (the other being ""Tron: Legacy""). The music is great without intruding. Pathos is, thankfully avoided. The cast of section 9 - especially Batou and aramaki - work for me very well. The performances of the villains are nothing to write home about, though.The very good: This feels like a solid base for a franchise. There's a chance here to expand into the philosophical aspects and give the other members of Section 9 more definition in further movies as well as expanding on the hacking and ""standalone complex"" aspects. Doing all that in the first movie in depth would have felt rushed/forced to say the least. Will definitely buy once the DVD comes out. Maybe even rewatch in the theater to catch some more detail.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I think I've see the animated GITS perhaps 50 times. And I owned the manga as well, which I read multiple times.In this movie I see pieces of the original, scenes done exactly like in the GITS anime. And they are nearly perfect, beautifully done. As many other reviewers have stated, the movie is a visual spectacle, but is, as is Hollywood, hollow. The original themes and story disintegrated into a hollow form that reeks of interference by those that never understood the original.It's a bit of a mix visually of The Matrix, Blade Runner, Assassin's Creed (the game), and weirdly, Max Headroom. It's like those in charge of the movie had a lot of great influences, but couldn't be creative enough to develop their own and didn't want to stick to the original GITS imagery for reasons I can't guess.The storyline is pure Hollywood and we've seen it a million times. It totally breaks away from the OG GITS and has a ""bad guy"" who, in his highly altered form is muscular, which is so weird and un-necessary. His voice glitches like Max Headroom, and he has to explain his whole ""thing"" to the audience, giving us a narrative instead of building a story that brings us to the internal struggle of The Major and the human condition or ""ghost's"" need to explore, evolve, become stronger in ways that seem dangerous or illogical to some. Evolution, indeed, is a critical piece of the story that is simply washed away.Add onto that the standard stagnant seen and heard in any other action movie one-liners and the multitude of advertisements with little to no character development and, you get a ho-hum 4 star rated overproduced underwritten predictable story with a lot of paint (visual effects) to cover up that fact and hope the shiny object will keep you from noticing.I'm personally tired of it. Of all the focus on gun fights, drugs, and fighting in general while dumbing down one of the most important stories told, a story with real-world, right-now consequences voiced by some of the most powerful in the world (Elon Musk) when it comes to AI, humans, and what kind of future to expect.As an adaptation of the OG GITS anime, it gets a 1 or 2 for trying and succeeding in the visual through some scenes (just an homage to the original) that are nearly frame-for-frame exact. But the most important part, the story, is gone. Stick to the anime or manga. Watch and read it several times. And remember that it predated the Matrix and perhaps even inspired it. It's brilliant and should have been given a more serious live-action representation. The actors all did their job. As did the visual effects artists. The writers and producers failed miserably on this one. As a stand-alone movie, ignoring the original material, it's a solid 5. Worth a watch if you like sci-fi movies.","9 out of 31 found this helpful.

But the remake was a shallow action/neo-noir style film.Ghost in the Shell was directed by Rupert Sanders, who was best known for Snow White and the Huntsman. What he does well is visuals. The film had some great cityscapes, even if there were a bit too influenced by Blade Runner and the Geisha Robots were cool. There were also so decent action sequences even if the film just recreated some of the big set-pieces from the anime.As stated, Ghost in the Shell did have big ideas. They were ideas about the blurring lines between humanity and technology, and the role of memory and its importance on identity. But the live-action film's approach was skin deep.The film was notorious for its casting of Scarlett Johansson in the lead role. If the remake had been set in North America, Europe, or a culturally ubiquitous city it wouldn't have been much of an issue. However, the film was clearly set in Hong Kong and the reveal in the film was ScarJo's character was really an Asian woman's brain in a robot that looks like a white woman. It was like the filmmakers wanted to pour petrol on a fire.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

While the original's story was sometimes obscure and full of existentialist-lite musings from a philosophy 101 class, this remake offers slight but clear story and only the occasional moment of pondering.Having not been that thrilled with the original, I don't mind the changes. My main issue with the movie is that I never believe in its world.The first thing that bothered me were the advertisements. The city has giant Bladerunner-style ads, only these are holographic. They look pretty cool. They also look ugly and frightening, which means no advertising company would create such things. The movie goes for a sci-fi look without thinking about the underlying realities of the world.That may sound like a minor thing, but that sense of unreality suffuses the movie. No one is going to want service robots that look disturbing. It makes no sense that Major has a patchwork body but a face that is perfect in every detail. There's no reason that in a message from a terrorist his holographic face keeps shifting.Everything is done for effect. Nothing is done because it comes from a specific version of the future.Some of the action is pretty good, but less effective than had I cared about the main character. I was more intrigued by Takeshi Kitano's Aramaki than by Scarlet Johansson's rather bland heroine.This is very much an uninspired Hollywood action flick, with good special effects, a disposable story, and not a thought in its head even when it's trying to pretend to be thinking. For that, it's fine.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

No. Some story elements were simplified to appeal to a broader audience and I would have done some scenes and dialogues differently. But overall it is a solid movie in the Sci-Fi genre. The atmosphere, effects, music and aesthetics are stunningly beautiful! You can still feel the heart and soul of Ghost in the Shell. The story is there - slightly changed but still thought provoking. There are many scenes where you can really see the amount of work that was put into making this movie - tiny details in the background, the aura of Hong Kong and other locations where this film was shot and just the overall look and feel. If this wasn't an adaptation but an original film I'm pretty sure the ratings would look completely different and the critics would be positive only.

Scarlett Johansson plays the lead character Motoko Kusanagi/Major well, the cinematography and all the technicals are really good and an eye-candy, the movie is entertaining but in no way, something extraordinary like Matrix or Fight Club were at their times.To the matter of ""whitewashing"" - many of those critics just show their own cultural bias or should I say ""bubble"". A many figures of the Japanese manga/anime series look more like white people as Asian people. Just look at the eyes, the hair colors, the body posture (Asian woman mostly don't have that big boobs and they are more tender, smaller built than in mangas/animes shown - at least without a surgical ""improvement""). I remember many discussion in the 80s/90s why many Japanese artists used in many animes/mangas Western looking characters and not Asian looking ones (Captain Future and many others like Appleseed etc.) Everyone with eyes but not with tomatoes for eyes can see that fact if he reads a manga or watches an anime. Or take e.g. Link, the great hero of the Zelda franchise - omg, he is blond and white!In my opinion, Scarlett Johannson is a good choice for the Major - she just fits into those kinds of movies well (Lucy, Under the Skin, Black Widow). Ofc it is not p.c. to say so - how racist it is if a Japanese writer or comic artist draws white characters instead of Asian ones! Yeez, that's so narrow- minded, that I just gotta say, yes, Nazis are racists, but those left-""liberal""-brainwashed-zombie- walkers walk just the same road hand in hand with the rightwingers: if the production company would have cast a black actress for the Major this kind of people would call the casting ""progressive"" and rate the same movie 10+ Well, I will tell you one ""truth"": if you judge people by the color of their skin it is always racism, no matter what your intention in judging so is.So what's left to say!? Ghost in the Shell is a good movie for all lovers of sci-fi but it is no ""must-see"". Well, for fans of Johansson (like me) it is.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Today, Ghost in the Shell has been adapted by the American filmmakers and does it live to expectations? In way I can say yes but it has its faults, but redeems itself in quality effects, production value and some worthy screen performances.The story is set in the way ahead future, in a time where both man and machine have combined to be a living organisms with enhanced abilities. Advanced cybernetic soldier Major (played by Scarlett Johansson) pursues terror plots and villains to keep the city safe from chaos and destruction. But when visions of her possible past seem to surface, she questions not only who she is, but who is the manipulator of this possible threat.Now I will advise that I haven't seen the original, I had plans to in hopes of finding what was there and wasn't but it's hard to get a copy of it in Australia. From what I watched, it felt like it tries to be faithful to the source material but white being it's own film, not wanting to affect the original's acclaimed status. The plot is straight forward to follow, but I did feel that the themes of the story weren't justified as much, you get a bit here and there but I wanted more and see how characters would have changed and even ask the audience what they would do in a world like that.Visual effects and the production value are really in high value here, with some state of the art CGI, practical make up and a electronic music score that suits to the anime. With visual effects wizards Weta Workshop and other artists credited, they pull off an amazing job that could lead to future award nominations. Acting is pretty much good, with ScarJo being her usual best in a role that's similar to 'Lucy'. She's fit, dazzling and gives whatever she can in her lead role.To wrap this up, GITS packs a wallop on the eye in terms of visual effects, cinematography and style, but it does miss a few steps in terms of the story themes. - 3/5 Check us out on facebook and Instagram- The Autistic Reviewers!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Sorry, GITS was one of those anime experience as a kid in the 90's that just blew the mind. Whilst they got some of the visual elements correct they ripped out its soul and philosophical thought invoking heart, leaving only the 'Shell' behind, it is a bland and unsatisfying experience compared to the 1995 anime - Which is one of the greatest Japanese pop culture contributions to film ever made. If they had kept the original plot intact and script similar to the 1995 movie, gave it to someone like Ridley Scott or Nolan had actors that were representative of the characters, it might have stood a chance. There is good reason that this movie bombed hard at the box office... The reaction from fans of the original was - You Cannot Capture the Magic of a Classic - They tried with Robocop... it failed... They've tried with Ghostbusters... and failed on and on and on so was mostly boycotted, those that had never heard of the movie... it would just look like any other cash-in on the current fandom around Japanese popular culture.

When a new terrorist threat reaches a dangerous level, Major is the most qualified to put a stop to it however, the more she investigates, the more she uncovers about her past.Right off the bat, I've got to say that Ghost in the Shell is a truly visually stunning example of sci-fi, Rupert Sanders' film brought to life with some mightily impressive special effects and Jess Hall's cinematography, some of the sweeping shots of the city really wowing me. The score from Clint Mansell and Lorne Balfe suits the visual style of the film to a tee and aids this adaptation in bringing the manga to life.As impressed with the visuals as I was, some of the action sequences such as the water fight or the spider tank finale, in comparison to the 1995 anime, don't have the same energy levels to them, which is probably because you could never capture the same vividness that exists in the animation of an anime. It does make me wonder how they'd even go about making a live-action adaptation of something like Akira.The story has been fleshed out some more and changes have been made for this adaptation, which led to film becoming a little weighed down for me. It's an interesting story but there are some serious pacing issues at times, making the film feel a lot longer than it actually is.Coming to the performances, Ghost in the Shell features a quietly impressive lead in Scarlett Johansson, whose emotional range perfectly reflects the progression of both the story and her character's journey. Her performance will most likely be overshadowed by the whitewashing controversy, which I'm sure will lead to some boycotting the film overall but she does give a good performance. Out of all the supporting cast, I'd have to say I enjoyed Pilou Asbæk's performance as Batou the most because, aside from Major, he's the coolest character in this film.I tend to avoid the politics of a film upon release and when looking back on it after. With that in mind, Ghost in the Shell is a perfectly fine adaptation that suffers a little with additional narrative yet serves as a real treat for the eyes and ears.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

"7","/10","While defusing the impact of its original source material, Ghost in the Shell is a versatile cyberpunk ride","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3679821/?ref_=tt_urv","Screen_Blitz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24623283/?ref_=tt_urv","7 April 2017","This electrifying cyberpunk thriller marks a surprisingly competent remake of the 1995 anime hit 'Ghost in the Shell', compacted in the world of filled of unnecessary redos of popular source material. As the original animated feature set a touchstone for the science- fiction genre for its introduction of seminal ideas, this film sadly falls short of the impact that the original left on the cyberpunk genre, which should come to only little surprise since this reimagining operates as a more technological rehash of the events from the source material. What results is an entertaining, but somewhat predictable ride as this film manages to rip many scenes from the original and execute here in a similar fashion. Although director Rupert Sanders breaths a reasonable amount of spirit into this flick, it is hard to find this one blowing anything in the cyberpunk genre out of the water, which maybe could have been possible if the 1995 original never came about. Set in the futuristic city in Japan where human minds are connected by a network, this film enters Scarlett Johansson as Major, a cybernetically engineered humanoid who is revived by Dr. Ouelet (played by Juliette Binoche) after surviving a horrific accident. With her mind transferred inside her new humanoid body, Major is assigned by an anti-terrorist organization run by Chief Daisuke Aramaki (played by Takeshi Kitano) to take down cyber-terrorist Cutter (played by Peter Ferdinando) while struggling to uncover her mysterious past. Rupert Sanders uproots a visually stimulating ride clamoring with visceral cyberpunk themes and flashy action sequences that gracefully made the Japanese-animated picture a hit. But for a film that heavily borrows from its superior source material, its unfortunately not as impactful as it sets out to be. Addressing complex themes of artificial intelligence, the story boasts a strong edge of compelling ideas along with some subtle thrills to drive the briskly paced plot. The subplot dealing with the lead character fighting to uncover her past makes a good source of twists and turns sprinkled throughout the entirety. While Sanders employs just a fair amount of gun-blazing action sequences to pump up the adrenaline, it is the visual presentation of the futuristic setting is what takes the crown for the most powerful eye-grabber. Sanders sets the action in a techno-packed metropolitan city complete with giant CGI holograms towers above every corner and and flying cars soaring through the air; a wildly absorbing eye candy that echoes futuristic Los Angeles from Ridley Scott's 'Blade Runner'. As for the acting department, Scarlett Johansson, veteran action star of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, does a fairly well job in the lead role. Although whether or not her performance defies against the whole white-washing controversy that has target this project is debatable, it is hard not to admire her effort. The rest of the cast including Juliette Binoche, Takeshi Kitano, Peter Ferninando, Michael Pitt, and Pilou Asbaek all get the job done, but their character fall short memorability and charisma. Furthermore, none of the characters with the exception of the lead character carry a strong emotional gravitas to their figures, and results in a rather disappointing roster. Ghost in the Shell is an visually stunning cyberpunk thrill ride that may not hold the thoughtful energy of the original film, but nonetheless sets ground for an compelling good time. As for remake of original material, this one is nothing out of the ordinary (unless for those who have not seen the 1995 film), but that does not mean it isn't an entertaining ride.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

Some main events of the plot have been changed so much that now it's hard to imagine it as the same Ghost in the shell. But go ahead if you want to experience the new plot as a fan of GitS despite of all this.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

I knew about the disappointment people had to it, and some of it's specific criticism.I loved the characters in this movie, the setting and the story. I would love to see a sequel with the same actors. Loved Pilou Askbæk as Batou - P E R F E C T.I had a bit of a bad feeling when it came to Scarlett playing what originally was a Japanese character. However, without spoiling anything, it made cold, cruel and a bit sadistic sense later in the movie. I think the backlash must have come from the fans of the original. It can be hard watching something you felt was perfect being remade. It just can't ever beat that feeling. I have seen the originals, but I never got that attached to them.If you are a die hard fan of the originals, lower your expectations! If you love scifi action with an existential deeper plot, this is for you. If you like action, but don't really care for scifi you might find it boring. Should see it for Batou, just saying.","9 out of 10 found this helpful.

It's a bit of a shame there's not more Japanese actors, seeing as it's still set in futuristic Tokyo (but filmed in New Zealand & China...), with heaps of shots of the annoying super-size digital billboards. Aramaki (Kitano) has an OK cameo as the police chief, but is otherwise wasted. Basically, Major (Johansson, doing her best to walk stiffly) is a human brain (""ghost"") transplanted into a robot body (""shell""), who's then trained to be a SWAT operative - they show you all this in the first 5min, before picking up where the original film starts. Her partner's Batou (Asbaek), who they do a good job of how he gets his enhancements. Dr Ouelet (Binoche) is her ""creator"" and conscience, as Major battles to define her humanity and 'soul'. Cutter (Ferdinando) is a poorly-written bad-guy.It's quick - just over 90min - and, like the original, I'm left feeling ""why?"". Didn't have a huge impact on me, unfortunately. Sure, it's got some good fights and explosions; Kuze (Pitt) poses some interesting questions; and you're constantly almost seeing Johansson nude, but there's not much meaning or a bigger picture of why we should care for the characters. Still, it's better than 'Lucy'.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

They watch this expecting a clone of the 1995 Animation classic and instead got a slick, western flick (as in not Asian: not spaghetti) Sci Fi jaunt with an outstanding story, an excellent cast portraying very sympathetic characters, set to a wondrous mid-future backdrop.Production values are top notch and the visuals and soundscapes are very, very faithful to the aforementioned 1995 animation which is considered to be one of the finest science fiction epics (let alone Animation) and to think that all the nuance and subtlety of a culturally rich story aimed at an intelligent, Japanese audience could be faithfully reproduced as a US live action production would be unrealistic.Some people forget that the 1995 version itself was not the original and was panned by some as an accessible (read bastardised) simplification of the late 80's Manga serial.As such, this film stands on its own as a remarkable and engrossing story with most of the Japanese aspects transliterated into a US accessible format. Yet as a ""lifer"" in Japan and a massive fan of the 1995 version and original Manga (seen and read in Japanese) I have to say they did the best they could.Could they have got more Japanese in the cast? Yes. Was it important that they didn't? Maybe... Some even call it a whitewash...But what they did by making her a whitey is something they couldn't do in the original: They stripped her of her entire identity. Her shell was no longer even the same race as the original. Imagine the alienation looking in the mirror.Scarlet did a fantastic job in bringing that alienation to the screen.. Not only that, but from the side, her profile right to the tip of her nose was spitting image of Major in the Anime.And the key scenes of the movie (you'll know both of them when you see them) left me shivering!!!A very, very good translation of a Japanese tale into English - Just don't expect the original.If I have one regret, it is that the superlative traditional music of the end credits was not used during the beginning of the film as it had been in the animation.","16 out of 20 found this helpful.

Thanks to Scarlett Johansson's portrayal of the enigmatic Major, the film offers a visually stunning and thematically rich experience that leaves audiences spinning their brain long after the end credits.One of the film's greatest strengths is the faithful adaptation of the original anime, bringing to life the iconic imagery and complex themes of the genre. From the sleek cybernetic enhancements to the bustling neon-lit cityscapes, every frame is meticulously crafted to transport viewers into the immersive world of ""Ghost in the Shell.""
At its core, the film grapples with profound questions about identity, consciousness, and the nature of humanity. As the Major unravels the mysteries surrounding her own existence, audiences are brought to contemplate the implications of a future where the lines between man and machine blur ever further.While the story's cyberpunk aesthetic and intricate plot may be challenging for some viewers to follow, the film compensates with exhilarating action sequences and breathtaking visuals that keep the adrenaline pumping. From pulse-pounding chase scenes to gravity-defying combat, ""Ghost in the Shell"" delivers thrills in spades.Yet there are moments of reflection that add depth and nuance to the narrative. Whether pondering the ethical implications of technological advancement or exploring the fragile nature of memory and identity, the film offers plenty of food for thought amidst the excitement.While some may criticize the film for its pacing or lack of character development, these minor flaws are outweighed by its overall impact and entertainment value. This film may not be perfect, but it succeeds in capturing the essence of its source material and delivering a thought-provoking cinematic experience. So, strap in and prepare to be dazzled by this visually stunning and intellectually stimulating sci-fi epic.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Scarlett Johannson and white washing: From all the criticisms I read after watching the movie this bugs me the most. The Anime character doesn't look very Japanese to me. In general, 90% of the Manga I read in my life, had western looking main characters(even if I only read what was available in my country back then, so I understand that this most probably was a very slimmed down selection for the western market.) I really think the whole debate doesn't have anything to do with ghost in the shell at all. There are so many movies out there that actually white washed some characters that really should have been African/Asian etc. but people rather pick on Scarlett Johannson for playing a woman that really looks like her in the movie?! Please think twice before jumping this hype train and shitstorming all over the internet.2. Scarlett plays like a wooden Ben Affleck and her role is one dimensional: You don't say!? She hasn't really decided for herself if she's machine or human and only had one year to find some sort of place in this world. She plays that spot on, period.3. The movie is just another Hollywood action movie and crippled the philosophical approach of the Anime: If you watch this movie and it doesn't encourage you to think about some very crazy, frightening, disturbing, controversial problems and monstrosities a future with available technology like this might create, in a society like ours, that already is driven by profit and stepping over dead bodies for reaching our goals. Then it's most likely not the movie's fault. If you are one of those people that need stuff like this forced down their throat for 3h so they eventually finally think about controversial topics, then go watch Civil War. It's true that the plot was simplified and the writers boiled most things down to a Robo Cop vibe, but it works rather well I think. Especially compared to Robo Cop, Ghost in the Shell just works so much better on so many levels. If you are a die hard fan of the original Anime on the other hand, then why were you expecting a perfect copy of your favourite movie that somehow magically did something better than the anime that justified the existence of the Hollywood adaptation?","22 out of 29 found this helpful.

Each character had a great identity under their surface, though many critics would disagree (many of which were unfamiliar with the anime movie).The score sounded amazing. The whole feel of the movie is very enveloping. The pace is also perfect. by the end, the movie just feels so neatly wrapped up, it should have ribbon tied to it. Many movies nowadays feel very jittery and forced, but this had a great flow to it. Watch it. You might love it, you might hate it. But don't just hate on it because everyone else, and critics did.

Anime fans will nitpick the differences but it doesn't matter. It feels exactly the same and is pretty but unsatisfying.Hyper PC people will complain about ScarJo being white completely ignoring the original creator giving his full blessing to the idea. She was fine in the role.Ultimately both the original and this are more about art then any story. Like many Japanese movies and anime it's lots of cool vignettes and poses but little substance. I'm not saying all Japanese movies or anime are like that but there is definitely a portion that fit that stereotype.

Definitely understand the criticism. But after a couple years and 2-3 watches it has resonated and grown in me. Huge fan of the original + soundtrack. Feel like they captured the melancholy and themes from the source pretty well. Honestly think Juliet Binoche made the film. She made me feel the connection and sincerity towards Mira and what she had done/her belief/moral compass. Could feel the love she felt, but the complicity in something quite terrible and inhuman. SJh has genuinely grown in me tho.Cerebral enough to make you ask yourself some questions (even after the anime) while being entertaining and visually appealing.","5 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's good in some ways and bad in others. Overall a bit disappointing as it did have potential there. Visuals are great with some great props and sets. The scene's they lifted directly from the anime tend to be the best parts but yeah plot is a bit all over the place and dialogue is kinda wooden. I would've preferred a more thought provoking plot line rather than the origin story they gave the Major which wasn't really very good. In fact they could've just mentioned her back story from stand alone complex in passing and got on with something else. A big thing that annoyed me is she's the first full cyborg and it's set 1 year later so in that time she gets all this special training in combat, and hacking and joins Section 9 as a Major. Why couldn't it have been a few years at least? And then it's set in Tokyo which is very cool except most people seem to be white and speak English while the head of section 9 is Japanese and speaks Japanese even when other people are speaking to him in English. It's just too weird so I'm thinking the Japanese Dub actually might be better in this regard. Anyway it's OK. If you're a fan of the series you might enjoy some of the visuals and some scenes but don't expect much from the plot. Also soundtrack was very basic and underwhelming but did use music from the original in the end credits at least. I feel like if they did a second movie it might be more interesting now that they've gotten the awkward origin stuff out of the way.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It had its good qualities and bad qualities. First let's start with what they did right. The atmosphere was exactly like old ghost in the shell movies and show. It was a dreary. near futuristic setting. They definitely hit it out of the park in this respect. Also some, but not all of the characters were cast very well. They cast Bato very well, but I was not as happy with the major's (Scarlett johanson) choice of casting. Their chief was also cast very well. Now here's where they messed up. The story is where it went wrong. The story itself wasn't terrible, but it was nothing like the spirit of ghost in the shell. A continuous theme of ghost in the shell is the question of what is humanity and identity, due to cybernetics and advanced AI's. And this film does not even attempt to do this. It would have been a fuller and better, as well as more dramatic, but it gets dumbed down to mere revenge scenario.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The cinematography is remarkable but the story is a hot mess and frankly in 2017 no one is impressed by Hollywood nailing CGI.My first problem with the film is that thought it is set in the fictional Japanese city of Niihama every main character is Caucasian. A company of white people with white scientists creating white robots. Even the protagonist, who was originally an Asian woman, was placed in a Caucasian cyborg. I haven't read the anime but ""based on"" implies the creators can make changes to the original material.Another thing that bothered me was that it was your basic, around the mill action movie with gorgeous, badass characters that go around punching the hell out of people mainly for the sake of it. It had no substance and though I agree that a movie needs also be entertaining it seems that now that's all movies are. Art should contribute not just entertain.Somewhere around the middle of the film a limp attempt was made for an existential quest but the film only ended up contradicting itself. Dr. Ouelet says ""We cling to memories as if they define us, but... they really don't. What we do is what defines us"" but throughout the film Major feels alone and disconnected because she misses her memories: ""Everyone around me seems to fit. They seem connected to something, I am... not"". In the first half of the movie she makes certain choices because of who she thinks she is, which is defined by what she ""remembers"", while on the second half of the movie she changes completely because she regained her memories and therefore her true self. Bottom line is the screenwriters through in some pompous lines without any regard for how they fit with the story only to make the protagonist sound wise.I was also upset by the ""judge, jury and executioner"" concept. Vigilantism is always wrong. I know there are crimes that make you want to take the perpetrators head of right then and there but what society would we live in if the injured party got to decide the perpetrator's sentence? Last but not least, I was not impressed by Scarlett Johansson's performance of the cyborg Major. Summer Glau did a far better job in ""The Sarah Connor Chronicles""","13 out of 57 found this helpful.

'Ghost in the shell' is about a human enhanced to be a cyborg supersoldier 'Major' played by gorgeous Scarlett Johansson and her self doubts of the reality induced in her mind and along the way of discovering her reality comes upon a lot of unsavoury secrets which results in the minimal number of plot twists observed in the film.
The biggest issue with the film can be observed to be the inconsistency of the plot and sub plot points and sequences which lack momentum which can almost put you to sleep with boredom.
But on a positive light the film is benefited by a couple of good performances.
Specially Scarlett Johansson and Juliette Binoche who plays Dr.Ouelet manages to induce a bit of emotion to the storytelling and uplifts the quality of the flow.
The other downside of the film are some action sequences which were not executed well.
Specially some stunts performed by Scarlett were painful to watch because of how badly they have been executed.
Visual effects had their own flaws too.
Ultimately, this film managed to entertain me that I really could look over its poor script, predictability and lousy visuals because the film managed to gain back the lost momentum leading up to the climax and gives a satisfactory ending to its own flawed story.","0 out of 10 found this helpful.

I have collected the whole franchise and still watch them to this day. The film is this fan's newest must have and I am glad I got it. I enjoy this movie. The film should be embraced by the fans of Ghost in the Shell for it's efforts to bring the complicated story to the live action science fiction genre. The sets and design as well as the special effects are all top notch. The film moves at a brisk pace and the action scenes are well done. The actors were all well cast and did a good job in bringing the characters to the big screen. There has been a lot of talk about comparing Ghost with Blade Runner. I consider Blade Runner my favorite movie of all time. I accept the comparison and can see it on several levels. What I see here is a future cult film. It is a shame the way this film was cast aside when released but that is what happened to Blade Runner. In the future we may see a Ghost in the Shell receive a higher score which it deserves. If you haven't seen this film I recommend it highly.","8 out of 9 found this helpful.

Borrowing heavily but loosely from the first anime movie and a bit from the second, this GITS lacks the narrative coherence and philosophical impact of the originals.Story: The writing is just bad, like it is made by a junior high school kid doing a poor job of cut-and-paste. What made the original GITS movies classics was not simply the subject matter - cyborgs and e-terrorism - but what that implies for those who are heavily modified. The Hollywood version completely fails to understand this and thus misses the mark by a wide margin. It is merely empty eye-candy.Visuals: The CGIs are cool, but sadly do not really add or advance the story or the experience. The most glaring examples include the opening scene, the running chase, and the end fight. The Hollywood versions are so poorly done that it makes you wonder why they even bothered. I heard that Mamoru Oshii, the director of the two original films, praised this movie. I think he may have been simply polite, because quite frankly the Hollywood versions are insultingly bad.Casting: It doesn't matter if non-Japanese actors were cast - after all, it is not at all clear in the original movies that the Major or Batou are Japanese, though in the manga and the series it is more obvious. Shamefully, the characters in the Hollywood version lack the subtlety to make them remotely interesting or at all sympathetic. They are just plain boring. Worse, the Hollywood Major and Batou are only superficially like the manga or anime versions.Had Hollywood made a completely new and different story, a lot of this might have been forgivable. But by trying to retell the same story but failing amateurishly to even understand what made the originals so loved by fans, at the end of the day this version is just another bad sci-fi movie.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

They have developed technology to but a human mind in an entirely synthetic body. The first successful test is a woman; she has lost her previous memories and is told she is Mira Killian, survivor of a terrorist attack that killed her parents. A year later she is 'The Major', working for anti-cyberterrorist group; Department Nine. Here she and her colleagues are tracking a terrorist known as Kuze who appears to be targeting Hanka but as she does so she learns more about her past and it doesn't match what she had been told... she becomes determined to discover who she really was and what happened to her; something certain people don't want exposed.I was a little unsure about this film before watching as I really enjoyed the original anime film and 'Stand Alone Complex'; I needn't have worried. This adaption kept the feel of the original without being a mere remake... that said some iconic scenes from the original are recreated. Scarlett Johansson does a really fine job as The Major; given the fact that her character is a cyborg it doesn't matter that she isn't Japanese. She is ably supported by Danish actor Pilou Asbæk, as her partner Batou, and Takeshi Kitano as her boss, Chief Aramaki, among others. The story kept me gripped with a combination of thrilling action and solid character development. The special effects are really impressive even on a relatively small TV screen; I'm sure the cityscapes would look absolutely amazing in high definition on a big screen. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to science fiction fans, especially if you enjoyed the anime... it is clear that not everybody likes this adaption but you won't know till you try.","26 out of 36 found this helpful.

Or the protagonist, with a troubled yet unknown past, and she makes sure to say it more than a few times in the film. Such cliché use of dialogue with very little interpretation, giving the viewer no possibility to ask questions about anyone in this film.The only element, aside from ScarJo, that works is the visuals. Stunning CGI with beatiful colors and environments. The action scenes are really well choreographed, except for the fight in the water, where everything looked fake.ScarJo is exceptional as always and really embodies her character through a lot of body expression and complex emotions that makes this cyber-human believable.

The film, much like The Major, is a shell with fragments of an otherwise compelling ghost.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I guess when profit is your main goal, this is what happens. The story is totally bastardised. Granted, the original GITS plot borders on impenetrable at times, but they've taken out all the intrigue, mystery and complicated ideas, only to replace them with a standard action plot you can find anywhere. They also weirdly mix in some minor elements of the 2nd GITS anime. They showcase a lot of the iconic scenes from the original but that's about it really. Why even bother calling this GITS? O wait, money, that's why. The result is quite frankly a soulless (ghost-less?) exercise in style over substance. Don't get me wrong, I love a bit of gorgeous stylish eye candy but there wasn't enough originality even in that regard. Good points: Scarlett Johansson and particularly Juliet Binoche are very watchable actors. Though Johansson sometimes was too robotic/emotionless at times - she was still supposed to be human right? The Yakuza bar scene is tension filled and original to this version (even though ultimately pointless). The only other interesting change they made concerns the Major's back story, who she was before she was made into a cyborg. It's unexpected, affecting and emotional. The music isn't half bad. Overall, it really should have been edgier, artier and taken more risks. They should have tried to stick to the original plot - extending it and clarifying the vagueness. Instead they took out vast chunks of difficult material in order to appeal to a mass audience. Disappointing.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

They aren't some emotionless things. Also, the Major has a very sexual, sensual personality. All the actors looked the part, she bombed it. Add her portrayal of the Major plus the garbage half produced copy of the original storyline, and you have a failed movie.

I can differentiate between one format and another so I don't mind if this film is not an exact duplicate of the original. Also, I find the complaints about the casting ridiculous. Seems a lot of people forget that Major is a machine body so it does not really have to be Asian. To me, this movie was just really cool as I loved the visuals and style of the film. It reminded me of a cooler version of that Keanu Reeves film from the 90's, Johnny Mnemonic which I also really enjoyed and it pretty much bombed at the box office. I just like the whole future setting, but the future along with its cool colors and stuff kind of is depressing too scenario. I enjoy the anime Akira for this reason too, that would be cool to see a live action adaptation, but chances are it will not happen as it was floated around for a bit, but considering this one's lack of success and most anime adaptations failures I am pretty sure it will never be made unless the Japanese themselves take the initiative to do so.This one features a future where people are able to augment their bodies with robotic parts. However, a new technique has been devised that is all robotic body with the exception of a living brain. A female's brain is transferred into one such body and she becomes known as Major and uses her augmented body to help a special unit that fights cyber crimes and terrorism. The latest criminal they are trying to track down is a particularly devious one that is targeting scientist from the corporation that created Major. She along with the team try to track him down, but Major soon learns that there may be some secrets that the corporation that has given her the gift of a second life may be withholding from her about her past and how she came to be a ghost in a shell.As I have stated I really enjoyed the visuals in this film, but I also really thought the characters were cool too. Along with Major there is also a character named Batou who is really cool too. I have seen part of the second Ghost in the Shell film where he is the primary character and they did a really good job of making the actor who played him look like his anime counterpart. I also really liked the old man with the six shooter! Another reason I am sad this did poorly is because I would have really enjoyed another film featuring these characters.So, yes, I thought this movie was really good and it makes me want to watch the anime version of the film. It also makes me want to track down as many anime films as possible that have this kind of weird future setting as it just makes for a great looking film in live or animation form. The action was cool and the story was interesting too as I kept wondering what revelations would be made.","18 out of 24 found this helpful.

I've been watching the original anime for years off and on so my expectations were not exactly sky high. I can say that the visuals are really impressive although it does seem a little too clean and lacks an organic feel to the world. Most action scenes were impressive which for the most part were easy to follow and pretty cool/entertaining. There is a lot of fan service pulled directly from the anime and Rupert Sander's (director) pretty much nails it in almost every way.My biggest complaint with the film is its an extremely watered down version from the original narrative to cater to a wider audience. There's is a lot of external conflict with the character of The Major instead of personal battle from within. She does struggle with her inner growth as a character but its a far cry from the original anime. There is a lot that's changed with this adaptation so much in fact that it comes out to be a very average run of the mill action film but it's still a decent movie. It's also a step in the direction for adaptations and I hope that future directors take this movie into consideration when future ideas come up for similar attempts.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

First, the claims that the movie was whitewashed are true, but not for the reasons called out by popular media. Johansson is actually a good casting choice for the lead, as is the man playing her sidekick, Batou. But it's shocking how many extras and other actors are not Asian considering the location of the film - Tokyo. I mean, you couldn't find an Asian actor to play one of the scientists or the villain? The movie might as well be set in Sydney or Melbourne. The movie could have overcome this glaring problem with better direction or writing. But sadly, most of the performances lack any spark. Takeshi is on life-support and even Batou, despite an impressive attempt, comes off a little flat. The real disappointment is Johansson, though. She could have owned this role but she just doesn't turn it on. The Major should be played with more emotion. As Mamoi Kaori explains, she's fearless and wild. We don't get that vibe from Scarlet.

It was based specifically on 1995 Anime/and 2.0 CGI upgrade (which means no Tachikomas, but there was a spider tank). SCENES. Some scenes were clearly copied from 1995 Anime, or its 2.0 upgrade, and I mean copied in an almost frame to frame basis (there are even some comparisons of trailer elements on YouTube, if you want an example). some were partially copied, with some new elements introduced. (several elements were in fact good, like geisha's, but some changes were illogical and unnecessary). However, some other scenes were invented anew (f.e. yakuza bar scene) and their design was performed in a very sloppy manner. They do not match other scenes in style (and the difference in the choreography of the scenes, or logic of the gun standouts is way too visible f.e. Aramaki defending himself against a a squad armed with assault rifles with a suitcase) and are much less stunning visually. STORY. The story is very different, and is full of Hollywood clichés – Evil Corporation, fake memory etc. I was expecting a new story (and I'd rather prefer a new story to something, that I know well), however this new story is very secondary (to an extent, that I'd say I've seen it in every second American Sci-Fi movie including James Bond) and is mainly used to tie in the scenes, rather then to tell a story. It is heavily based on Motoko, rather than exploring and presenting the world around, and the concept is that Motoko is unique first human brain transplanted into a cyborg body, who is on a hunt for her past (and you can easily guess the whole plot from here). WORLD. The world itself is not that bad, although in those brief moment of world presentation, there was a designer's desire to shock us with futuristic ""asian/japanese"" (although the country was never mentioned, only the Prime-Minister was mentioned few times) world filled with bright colors and 3d projections. Try portraying glamorous cyberpunk on LSD to get the idea. ACTORS. Despite my initial skepticism partially due to the white washing, Johansson played the role well (although there was limited space for that), and it looked like at least she was familiar with the character she was playing from Anime/Series (unlike the scriptwriter), however actor playing Batou was very weak (the actor wasn't trying to play anyone at all - he was more impressive in his brief role as Euron Greyjoy in Game of Thrones), even though the casting and character design was good. Other members of Section 9 made too very brief appearance to say anything serious about them. Aramaki also was quite good, although Takeshi Kitano altered the character significantly. New characters were way to simplistic and cliché based (motherly figure, antagonist figure, foe-turning-friend figure, etc). VERDICT: 4/10 – Some scenes are visually good, and they are recreation of classical GITS (so much recreation, that i'd rather watch those scene incorporated into the anime) Some are way too bad/primitive/simplistic. Especially the bar scene, which leads to Motoko's torture scene, which was pretty unnecessary, and way too out of movie style (i got an impression, that it was there, as scriptwriter just wanted to have a female torture scene). I do not recommend seeing this in the cinema (CGI is not really that stunning – Dr. Strange CGI was way better), just wait for an HD version appearing on sale. Also if you are fascinated by trailer, per standard Hollywood practice trailer is way better then the movie.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Believing she was rescued from near death, Major (Johansson) becomes the first of her kind: a human mind inside an artificial body designed to fight the war against cyber crime. While investigating a dangerous criminal, Major makes a shocking discovery -the corporation that created her lied about her past life in order to control her. Unsure what to believe, Major will stop at nothing to unravel the mystery of her true identity and exact revenge against the corporation she was built to serve.Review: Although this movie looked pretty impressive, I wasn't that impressed with the storyline, and the characters. It jumps right in at the deep end, so you don't have time to get to know the characters, and Scarlett Johansson is playing the same type of character, as she did in Lucy. The scenery reminded of Blade Runner, and the action scenes were the same as Lucy, so it wasn't that original. Anyway, Scarlett Johansson plays Major, who has the body of a robot and the mind of a human. The company that transformed her into the superhuman, use her to fight against terrorist and crime, and while she is saving the city, she comes across some information about her makers, who lied to her about her past. She then joins forces with an abandoned robot, and a couple of her fellow soldiers, to fight against the company that made her but they are always 2 steps ahead. There are some other elements to the storyline but it's quite detailed and hard to explain. I personally got a bit bored after a while, because it seemed to go round in circles, and the predictable storyline became uninteresting after a while. I liked the chemistry between Major and Batou (Pilou Asbaek), and Aramaki (Takeshi Kitano), was super intense throughout but it wasn't enough to make this a classic, like the animated movie. If they are to make a sequel, they really need to give Major some screen charisma, because I think she was one of the main problems with this film. With that aside, it's still an action packed movie, with some decent futuristic scenes but I won't be rushing to see the sequel. Watchable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Rupert Sanders, 46, who brought you Snow White and the Huntsman in 2012. With only one big budget movie in his portfolio, I wouldn't have given him such a big project, especially as the original was such a huge hit but at least it made a profit at the box office. Scarlett Johansson was the perfect choice for the role but it's just too close to Lucy for me. I also think that this movie could have done with some other stars, so it didn't rely on Johansson so much. Anyway, it's not a film that I can watch time and time again but I have seen worse, when it comes to remakes.Budget: $110million Worldwide Gross: $170millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/crime/dramas, starring Scarlett Johansson, Pilou Asbaek, Juliette Binoche, Michael Pitt, Chin Han and Takeshi Kitano. 5/10","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Ghost in the Shell franchise is one of my most favorite anime franchises of all time and one of the most adult. Waking up on midnights during SNL sketches to see what was a sexy Law and Order cartoon was glorious. So a movie with live actors would make sense right? Yeah right.PLOT
Ghost in the Shell 2017 is misconstrued as possible. It takes several beats from different Anime franchises and makes nonsense. Sure the themes are there and the goal which is the same as usual. There is an evil hacker. He is unknown and made by the corporation. Now team of elite cyborgs must track him down to a conspiracy. Major Marry Killan a cop gone cyborg now must trace the evil with Batou a funny tough cyborg cop.There is a dumb plot twist at the end and you won't like it.ACTORS
This is where it is dumb. Don't expect Lucy Liu to play a Japanese woman. NOPE! It's ScarJo herself. Why is everyone else Japanese except her and speaking Japanese? The only reason why they chose her is because she's hot and can fight and marketable. He looks shorter than 1995 Motoko and can't act sad and with drawn yet stoic like in the anime but more bored than anything. As if she know she should not be here. So it only felt off with about how everything is. Beat Tekaishi plays Leader of Section 9 Apeface Amuraki. Togusa is barely noticeable.Why is Elvis the dog there? Why is the doctor from GITS 2 Innocence there? Why does this all disconnect?SPECIAL EFFECTS
Mostly good mostly bad. Mostly oversaturated. Sorry but there are too many holograms put here unironically. The fights are mostly good. But everything in this movie feels like it's just made by polygons and computers. Not a good look. Don't expect any full nudity. There is little blood and it's all PG-13.OVERALL
GITS is ok. But it could have been better. I don't expect a better movie any time soon so this is your best bet.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The cast was good. Having Scarlet as the Major was interesting, but as you get fully into the story line they used it fits perfectly fine.What really saddens me is they could not have had a worse weekend to open on. On one hand you have one of Disney's most iconic movies in theaters for its 3rd weekend.And on the other side you had a Dreamworks film opening against it. Which from what i see is still killing it.So two family style movies vs an obscure title at best when it comes to the masses.Its no wonder it didn't do well money wise. That is really sad because they did an outstanding job with he movie and its visuals. I would love to see them make a follow up. Better yet cut a deal with Netflix and have them continue it with a series that brings in more form the manga and anime series.","28 out of 40 found this helpful.

Visually it is pretty solid, it does good job to capture the GITS dystopian cyberpunk world: large skyscrapers, holograms everywhere, people all around enhanced with robotic implants, etc. Sometimes the lighting colors seem too flashy and inadequate and there are some large hologram ads which seem out of context, but it's not a big issue, the visual part remains on solid grounds and deserves praise.But then there's the real issue - the script, it is garbage compared to the original. The characters are one-dimensional: either good or bad. They lack any depth, their dialogues are shallow, unconvincing and feel forced. The garbageman acted by Shia LaBeouf is so flat it hurts to watch him. As a viewer it leaves you no room to emotionally connect to any of the characters - an aspect that is so beautifully done in the 1995 original. The thought-provoking aspects about blurring boundaries between humans and AI, and what an identity means in a highly advanced civilization are reduced to shambles.In short, this movie is what you get when an amazing, deep and complex original story is degraded and adopted for an average viewer who reads news about Kim Kardashian and watches reality shows.","30 out of 168 found this helpful.

It did not bore me.I am satisfied.Plot & Story: I really appreciate how they deviated the story but still were able to retain the essence and themes of the source material. I hold section 9's unity and trust with each other with a high regard.Actors: Scarlett Johansson delivers in this movie IMO. Beat Takeshi as Aramaki is badass and a awesome leader. Batou is great and complements well with the major. Kuze is freaky as hell. He is as they initially described as a combination of the Puppet Master & Kuze of the anime series. Music: The movie could have been mind blowing if they try to tap into Kenji Kawai's Iconic sound track and Yoko Kano's ""Inner Universë""and ""Torukia"". It is still good though. I still gave this movie a 9 out of 10 because of the musical score that could have been a lot better.Final Thoughts: Go see it in 3D and be immersed into a futuristic world where technology and humanity become one.

Reading through all the negative reviews I was afraid I wouldn't like the movie at all. However, now that I have seen it myself, I wonder if anyone who only has negative things to say about this movie are even real fans of the franchise to begin with. Most of the negative comments about Johanssen being the Major and that this movie is ""white"" washed clearly missed the point of the film. Was it supposed to be a perfect rendition of the franchise as true fans have come to know this world to be, ...no. But it is pretty close. The cast was what I felt was a good mix and embodied each character well, not perfect as I wished it would have developed each character more, but enough to know it is from the franchise. Besides, this is about Kusanagi. Even the different story arcs from the anime have taken liberties to ""reinvent"" the Major. This one made Kusanagi the most human. If you get hung up on these superficial aspects of the film that everyone seems to complain about, then I don't think you get Ghost in the Shell and wonder how much of a fan you really are. Even the creator approved of this film, so you can't say it isnt respectful to the source material.

It is a visual wonder first and foremost, with SUPERB world-building that sees a reinvention of Hong Kong's concrete jungle, through holograms and fascinating futuristic pieces & eye popping costume design. This positive extends to its action sequences, where seamless visual effects adds much needed flavor that engages its audience. Where Ghost in the Shell stumbles is when the aesthetic splendor subsides and focus is shifted to its narrative. For instance, Major's struggle with her memories was given the most simplistic conclusions, leading to far from emphatic reactions to its generic revelations. The brushed over character depth was another weak point, as the picture's talking points gravitates to the same themes, casting a shadow on everyone else's motivations.Ultimately, Ghost In The Shell feels like a generation-forward piece of science fiction, trapped within the confines of safe storytelling, as it unfortunately misses on the existential exploration of Major's identity. Nevertheless, this remains a gorgeous live-action. Rupert Sanders proves his understanding of the essence of an android-infested culture, and translates it perfectly to the big screen. 7/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There was nothing authentic or deep about this thing. In it there wasn't anything that you have not already seen in the originals that was not done better. The CGI is impressive, but the story is mixed up, the meaning is lost and the acting is superficial. Unfortunately that's part of the problem this movie has with Hollywood's lack of creativity. There was nothing there to think about. It is just Hollywood and SJ trying to make a buck off a popular series. By the way, why mix up the music from a sequel into this story?

The thing is; it doesn't matter that much at all. This is a very, very atmospheric film that is worth seeing just for that alone.

The topic on mixing human with artificial organisms has been many times before and better, even when it was unbearable to watch and/or stupid (Van Damme). One more proof that no cast or director or technicians or CGI creators, regardless of how good they might be, can carry out the essentially meaningless ""manga"" content in a movie and make it worth spectators' time.

The writing was mediocre at best and the best lines in the movie are also in the trailer. The plot felt to me like its something we have seen over and over again, and is starting to become clichéd. They tried to make it more modern, futuristic and appealing by adding the idea of hackers taking over cyborgs, but even then this has been done time again by classic movies like Total Recall and Terminator.One upside of the movie is Scarlett Johannson. She is probably the only reason to watch the movie. She makes the part her own throughout most of the film, only being let down by the mediocre writing and plot.After watching this it seems like Hollywood doesn't want to come out with anything original but wants to use CGI to appeal to moviegoers and make money.

This movie presents almost nothing, which makes it all quite dull in a sense. I won't spoil anything you can't read in the plot description, but if you are going to watch this, know this: In the first 2 minutes of this film, you will learn the following -A woman damaged her body, they saved her by putting her brain into a robot. She's first of her kind; strong, fast and can use a gun. Skyline photos of Tokyo shows hologram commercials and flying cars (I think), and that's all you get.That's literally all you get of an introduction to the reality of which this films take place, including the main character (Johansen) and her (complete lack of) story or personality. She plays an expressionless half-robot person that has some thoughts of her own but mainly does what her company tells her to do. Her face doesn't seem like she cares much, and since she doesn't, I don't.Perhaps I'm being a bit harsh. The movie is visually very pretty, and there are a few good characters along the way, but I unfortunately found myself not caring one bit for anyone, or their ""missions"". Everything I saw, everything the characters said, and everything the characters were fighting for, meant nothing to me watching it. This - as mentioned - is for me largely because the main characters gets no pre-story, and not much character development throughout the movie either (she is basically a robot, so I guess it makes sense she doesn't change much.) The bad guy is the type that nobody really sees or knows who is until the end (another person we won't feel anything for or against, until perhaps the end), and a reality I am not properly introduced to (so I have no idea whether or not what I am seeing is ""unusual"" or ""groundbreaking"", ""normal"" or whatever). It's all just running, jumping, hitting, small talk, guns shooting, guy speaks Japanese, bad guy, finish.This movie could have been so much better if they added 7 minutes in the beginning, showing us Mira (Scarlet Johansen) before she damaged her body and became mechanical. They could perhaps have made the good guys or the bad guys connected to the government or politics, and easily slipped in some society-defining information to the viewer. Don't we all love to dive into a new world or a futuristic society? Won't get much of a dive here. Instead, the two major parties involved in this movie is Mira and the unique, and borderlining criminal private company that made her (and thus a horrible representation of this reality/society), and a rogue criminal belonging to .. nobody. Put in a futuristic Tokyo you won't learn anything about. This movie is clearly made for the fans of the original stuff (just watch them downvote this review as they disregard all their integrity by NOT acknowledging the movie sucks, even thought THEY liked it. And even though I specified this review being from a non-fan perspective). The movie is an insult to those that are not fans. If not an insult, then just pure failure from the director who neglects so many storytelling aspects that today counts as ""basic"" in order to lay the ground work for a decent movie.I gave it 4 stars for having some OK/cool supporting characters and pretty visuals but (nothing extraordinary), and you'll miss absolutely nothing by never putting this on.","24 out of 148 found this helpful.

I like the other work of the director. The repeated use of crude, stupid whitewashing and a lack of sensitivity to the source morality killed the movie - not the first time a Hollywood remake is a disaster. Hollywood needs to stop destroying anything and everything just because it can. It is in disgust and annoyance that I write this. While I gave it the full chance, I wished that I had stopped and walked out at 40 minutes. Scarlet Johanson is as relevant here and has as much understanding of the source material as Natalie Portman did in Star Wars. The cyborg character is portrayed as unprofessional and having mommy issues - she is unfamiliar with her tools and amateurish in actions. This couldn't have been a much better movie sine Hollywood wants to insert itself everywhere and impose one of its name actresses, but reality is it doesn't work.. 3/10 for the graphics","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

Again I'm in danger of sounding like a very predictable stuck record but I have noticed how uncannily accurate trailers have been over the last couple of years but the downside is that the films they're plugging almost always give an uninspiring feeling to this audience member Looking on this site GHOST IN THE SHELL is based on a Japanese manga series but BLADE RUNNER meets THE MATRIX is still an accurate summary. One wonders if Japanese imperial ambitions in the 1930s and 40s might have led the producers to make it an international friendly type of sci-fi action adventure and just about every nation on Earth is represented here somewhere. It does give the feel it has been entirely produced by committee where even a potential Chinese will enjoy it never having seen Ridley Scott's 1982 cult film There's two problems though . First is you realise you're watching something totally unoriginal and when GHOST IN THE SHELL reminds you of other films you're constantly reminded the originals were probably better. Secondly and this is a bigger problem in that despite all the stunts, firefights , CGI , noise and bluster you're quickly puzzled as to what is happening and why it is happening. The film can be summed up about two thirds of the way through the running time where the gun totting cyborg heroine meets a male character where he gives her a long winded explanation and finishes with the line ""You know it already"" which is a great example of very poor plot exposition. In short not only GHOST IN THE SHELL a mess but it's a ill thought out derivative mess","8 out of 42 found this helpful.

I saw the movie and was instantly hooked. I loved it! The atmosphere, the plot, the characters, the back stories and the OST. Immediately after the movie I downloaded all the anime and saw it all. And guess what? I still like the movie the most. So to say they failed this movie is a complete understatement. I truly believe it's underrated and critiqued to harshly. They did many things and changed a lot of things to appeal to a broader audience and in my opinion it works. As a complete newbie to Ghost in The Shell I found the movie to have a striking balance between all it's elements, enough to keep me invested, curious and wanting more. It's a good film to whet your appetite. Nothing is to confusing, nothing is dumbed down to much or perhaps enough to give you the perfect understanding and intrigue. Overall I thought it was solid and a good introduction for someone who's never seen or heard about Ghost in the Shell. It won't appeal to everyone but don't negate the fact that it's definitely worth at least watching to see if you like it.","16 out of 25 found this helpful.

But this movie does pay homage to the original in a way i have never seen before, some scenes are recreated as close to exact as possible and i loved seeing them. The movie does portray its own dumbed down version of the story whilst maintaining some original elements.Obviously it has its flaws but the things it gets right outweigh the negatives.The world building is amazing and crosses the boundary of original styles and the new styles. The characters are cast pretty well.Some important scenes are recreated albeit in the dumbed down manner, but the respect to the original is still there.Try to have an open mind while watching it and you will enjoy it.","18 out of 29 found this helpful.

Have none professional weapon/marshal art choreographer to produce convincing scenes[while the main characters were supposed to be experts that can perform such acts at highest level, the above effort of creating a world for SCI FI films was less to none, the result felt like watching some retro movie that was done decades ago.In short, cliche story line, but I'm fine with that if the rest could be entertaining. Wasted an already developed background/characters from adaptation source.
Not up to date special effects.
Not building truthful world physics detail and feels unnatural.
Not enough professional guidance for weapon/martial arts/espionage, characters looks like amateurs at above all while their job was expert in all. I only wonder how could this happen, missing nearly all factors that made original series memorable or made any other SCI FI films a success.I've seen much much better films with the budget shown to make this film....
one can't help but wonder what exactly happened?I feel bad for the poor souls who got dragged into this, I believe there's something seriously wrong in between the process of making this film, and made it being memorable as the worst if not the worst considering the casting and budget was fine.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

But that is the highest praise I can really give this film. As much as Ghost in the Shell tries to recreate its original source material it just can't live up to it. And saying that really breaks my heart cause I really wanted to love this film so much more. But it just is not what it needs to be and instead feels like a hollow shell with no ghost inside. To start off with the positives. You have heard it before, but visually this film deserves soo much love. I wouldn't even be shocked if it got a lot of technical awards at the the Oscars. Cause this film defiantly deserves that much. And the visually speaking it is very true to what Ghost in the Shell was. I got goosebumps whenever I saw a scene recreated from the original manga, films, or ovas. It made me quite giddy with happiness seeing them. The film has a visual flare to it that makes it so strong and even helps many of the scenes. Scarlett Johanson also despite all the controversy I do think still thinks embodies the role of the Major in a amazing way, I enjoyed her character quite a bit. She does go revert from having a stale performance for parts of the film which could be seen as Rupert Sanders not really understanding how to give a performance with nuance, but there are more scenes where I feel Scarlett really does come out as the major who desires to learn more about who she is. As for story to tell you the truth there were some parts of the story I actually really liked. No it wasn't as complex as the original, but the basic ideas where still there. I was really enjoying parts of the story a lot I just wished the went a bit further on some of the points laid out and tried to be a bit more complex.Towards the negatives of the film is the fact that as I said why the basic ideas are still there they never really expand upon them and try anything really different like the original did. Honestly Blade Runner, All of the Matrix films and many other sci fi films feel like they did a better job on the ideas that Ghost in the Shell (the original) created. The film just tries to be to safe. It doesn't go as deep on any of the ideas it presents. I won't say it feels Hollywood cause as i said the ideas are still there and the film isn't as action focused as it should be. Now people talk about the whitewashing of a Japanese character and before this film came out I was pretty OK with it and through the first half of this film I was OK with it, but this film does something at the end that makes me feel wrong and strange. There is a choice they make at the end that will undoubtedly be the deciding factor on if u like or hate this film. Overall as hard as Ghost in the Shell tries to honor its source material and be engaging it in the end falls short of what could have been something truly magnificent.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

For what this attempts to do, the remake does an excellent job of conveying the underlying themes.

And yet, I really liked the movie. Yes, the story doesn't have the complexity and philosophical questions that the original 1995 film possessed, but they gave a damn good try to live up to the original. The futuristic world is created with glorious result, the storyline changes made the protagonist much more compelling to watch and the music was pretty epic too. The acting could have been better from the cast. But still, this is by far the best Live-action anime adaptation that Hollywood has made.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

My fears were unfounded, though.This is a movie that simplifies the original story, discarding some of the philosophy for futuristic action. But if I were to criticize it for something it would be that it didn't pay as much attention to detail, rather than the overall theme. They spent a lot of time showing overviews of a cyberpunk city (you know, neon and holographic commercials everywhere) and less explaining the minutiae of the world.Other than that, it was a good sci-fi action movie. It touched on the important issues that made the original a classic like the nature of the soul. The worse parts of the film were the beginning and the end, where some executive felt the need for pointless walls of text and/or narration. The moral in the ending is doing a disservice to the rest of the film which was well done, well acted and faithful to the original material. While focusing a little too much on the Major and less on her team (sniper Saito gets like a one second scene)Now I am going to rewatch the original and see if it was ever as good as I remember it. And BTW, if I hear another idiot saying that this was whitewashing I am going to slap them. Not knowing the original material is bad enough. Assuming it was something it was not just makes you look dumb.","12 out of 18 found this helpful.

The Ghost in the Shell franchise has spawned several sequels and series and is considered the quintessential cyberpunk science fiction story. So how does it stand up to the original? In short, not really. Scarlett Johansson plays the cybernetically augmented Major, a member of an anti-terrorist unit Section 9 in the hunt for the extremely proficient hacker known as Kuze. Funny walk aside I think she did a decent job of portraying the Major. It was by no means an easy task. Michael Pitt was OK as the disturbing Kuze, he seems to be good at these roles. The other casting was nothing special and the acting wasn't anything to brag about. The cinematography on the other hand was gorgeous. Almost every shot shined with the futuristic cyberpunk aesthetics, from the holograms adverts that swim through the city to the debilitated outskirts. The CGI and music were also topnotch and added to the cyberpunk atmosphere. This was without doubt a treat for the eyes and ears. Unfortunately the plot didn't explore the existential themes that was so well executed in the original film. They opted out for a more simplistic sentimental plot about Major's origins which worked in enough ways to carry the plot to its end. However this did not take away my enjoyment of the film and most critics in my opinion weren't fair in there critic. In contrast to other critics Ghost in the Shell stands out from the typical Hollywood drivel as a science fiction film worth viewing. My Thoughts on the ""whitewashing"" Despite the outrage for casting Scarlett Johansson as the Major, the fan outcry seemed to have spawned entirely from people outside of Japan. Even Oshii himself liked the casting of her stating: ""The Major is a cyborg and her physical form is an entirely assumed one. The name 'Motoko Kusanagi' and her current body are not her original name and body, so there is no basis for saying that an Asian actress must portray her. Even if her original body (presuming such a thing existed) were a Japanese one, that would still apply."" Fans and critics have forgotten the very essence of the movie and how the ""Shell"" doesn't matter in comparison to the ""Ghost"" inside it.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

As a woman, I was embarrassed for Scarlet Johansson for 2+ hours.Either American directors and studios just are too dense to get it or, more likely, they are too afraid that their audience is stupid and hence they dumb down their films for a wider audience. Unfortunately, this alienates the core fans of the original story and insults the potential intelligent viewer.Why am I writing this? Will the American studios ever learn? it is doubtful. One of the worst offenders (has that guy done anything original or creative?) JJ Abrams was just given the assignment to do Kimi No Na Wa... will he tone down the gender structure story? Will he westernize the setting? Will he 'improve' on that beautiful beautiful story with gratuitous morality? Will he lengthen the school girl's skirts? Will he... ah, whatever, we all know he will think he knows better and, like in Ghost In The Shell, end up deteriorating and diminishing the original.. that's what they always do.","20 out of 141 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Faithful Adaptation to a Ground Breaking Anime","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6355180/?ref_=tt_urv","Gmyster2020","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26722514/?ref_=tt_urv","10 December 2020","I normally don't write movie reviews but after reading a lot of the negative comments here on IMDb about this film, I felt compelled to set the record straight on a number of the complaints on here.First off, this film really stayed true to the original look and feel of the 1995 Anime. There was no cheesy product revamp or complete disregard of the original story. Best of all, it stayed clear of any PC stereotypes we've come to expect from 21st Century Hollywood.The first film was more of a philosophical journey as this version stayed in the psychedelic thriller mode which helped keep the focus more on the characters than the original. Togusa and some of the other characters do fade in the background, but Bateau and Motoko really come alive in this present version.The Anime only hinted at Motoko's relationship with Bateau but in this present film, we get a much more intimate look as to why these two are so loyal to each other. Even when Motoko begins to question her allegiance to Section 9 and also to Bateau, Bateau stays by her side regardless. Like the stray dogs he cares for, he is loyal to Motoko no matter what happens.Though the first Anime film focused on the human soul, the philosophy of being and the externalization of memory by technology, this present film really honed in on Motoko's personal journey and rediscovery of identity.After having watched this live action version of Ghost, Scarlet's performance really gives a more intimate look into the kind of character Motoko is. She's a human brain inside a synthetic body. Still a part of the world but detached from it because of the loss of her human body.This director really spent a lot of time with the original material, leaving behind beautiful imprints of the anime throughout the film. As someone who expected this film to be a horrible reboot like so many others, this was a very pleasant and enlightening surprise.The original Anime is a film I've watched over a hundred times since 1995 and now, after seeing this live action adaptation, I feel that I am now looking at Ghost in the Shell in an entirely different way.I would encourage the viewer to watch the original anime first so that you'll see how well this present adaptation parallels and compliments the original. It is very evident the original film was sacred to the Director as he succeeded in making an already incredible classic even more iconic with this film.When watching the original Ghost, be prepared to be profoundly shaken by its passionate outcry of modern dehumanization. But delve into this live action film and be seduced by its beauty, sadness, isolation and exploration of a feminine soul wishing only to have an identity in a faceless and soulless mechanistic world.I wonder if the Director's message may have been that in this soulless world of machines, Motoko was able to rediscover her own soul and not lose it amidst the chaos and confusion that surrounded her.This film was a great cinematic achievement and I'm very grateful to the Director and the cast for resurrecting Ghost in such a profound and illuminating way.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

As a fan of the 1995 original, I was lured in by the trailer, which comprised all the actually good scenes in the entire movie (probably because Scarlett Johanssen didn't speak). After seeing her in a number of movies, I have finally figured it out - she is Keanu Reeves with tits - no discernable acting ability, but marketable to adolescent fanboys. At least Keanu takes parts that fit his personality (or lack of same).Added to the disaster of the 'star' are the lack of a coherent plot, insipid dialogue, marginal CGI, truly stupid vehicles, and mostly wooden performances by the rest of the cast. Beyond the title and the water fight scene, there wasn't much to link it to the 1995 version. I am glad I waited for this to come up on cable - if I had paid to see it in a theater, I would be seriously pissed. The entire experience would be similar to going to bed with Heidi Klum, the waking up next to Rosie O'Donnell. It would get a '0' from me if allowed.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

It was in fact a good adaption! Especially when u compare it to other adaptions! The CGI was amazing atmosphere was right, the designs were so accurate and close, the only problem was the edited story, ALSO when comparing the movie to the anime you should keep in mind the GITS rich and amazing universe and story was made by multiple animes! Not just the original one!There was 3 big problems.1. its very hard to remake what is already perfect! There will be SO MANY critics and fanatics yelling even at slightest change or mistake!2. the fanatic anime fans who want everything to be sound and looks Japanese, and blind social activists who want to bash everything.3. They edited the story.For example FANATIC fans were keep crying about why the actress isnt Japanese.... when even the main character(major) never did resemble a Japanese girl(only in the first original anime film she was looking a little asian) and not to mention that in GITS universe major can have ANY form of body she wants! So nagging about her race is beyond stupid both in role AND visual!Or another problem was the FANATIC fans and social activists (who mostly had no clue about GITS universe) were keep bashing the movie for having all white actors EVEN though there was asian actors too and EVEN THOUGH in the anime AGAIN hardly any of the characters resembled an asian figure for same reason as major (prosthetic body), in fact the producers made a right choice to hire a good main actress and some good actors to give the viewers a good top score acting and nice English talking just to be bashed again for caring...In short this good movie was mostly victim of people who will never be satisfied with anything no matter how hard the producer tries, and this is why we will never get cool, good remakes...I gave it 8/10 who as an old fan of all GITS series gave the original animes 10/10, reduced 2 points due to editing story and trying to compress multiple stories in 1 movie.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

I celebrate this movie for its own originality. It draws from the earlier anime and manga material but is its own story. In the same way that ""Bladerunner"" created a unique, dark, dystopian Los Angeles, the new ""Ghost in the Shell"" creates a unique, dark, dystopian city of the future (New Port City or Hong Kong if you wish although the city is never named in this film) inhabited with all manner of people, augments, cyborgs, and robots. Many of the characters are familiar from the earlier movie. Some of the scenes are the same. Some adapted. Many all new.The story is the same but quite different at the same time. The imagery is unique to this movie. The question is the same in this movie as in the original (and in Bladerunner): What does it mean to be ""human""? Philosophers have been asking this question for 10,000 years, so do not expect an answer from this movie. It's all in asking the question.I was drawn in. My disbelief was suspended. The movie moved along and never dragged for me. After all, that's why I go to see a movie. If I want to see the original version, I have it on DVD and can watch that any time.

"5","/10","Ghost in the Shell is better at looking like the anime rather then replicating it","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3677913/?ref_=tt_urv","RforFilm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26680166/?ref_=tt_urv","4 April 2017","Let's talk about anime. For those that don't know, anime is animation that is produced in Japan. What separates it from American animation is that while the craft is seen as family-based entertainment in the states, it is taken very seriously in Japan. It's hard to describe it on paper, but when you see stuff like Sailor Moon, Speed Racer, Cowboy Bebop (an all-time favorite of mine) and anything from Studio Ghibli, you'll see what I mean. This has been the same when it comes to full anime movies. This had led to a lot of Japanese movies that have even seen releases in the states like Akira, Pokémon: The First Movie, and the subject of today, Ghost in the Shell. The 1995 original film is seen not just as an excellent anime, but one of the best-animated movies in general. It's themes of artificial intelligence, computer hacking, and blurring the line between human and robots were perfect to explore as the mid nineties had seen a growth in computer usage. A live action adaptation could potentially work, but the track record of American remakes of anime has been bad (Speed Racer and Dragonball: Evolution being such). Let's see if the new Ghost in the Shell can break that curse. In the near future in Japan, Major Killian (played by Scarlett Johansson) is a cyborg with a human brain after her original body was destroyed beyond repair and was chosen in an experiment by Hanka Robotics to put her mind into a mechanical body. Now she works for Section 9, an anti- terrorist bureau whose mission is to stop major hacking. She's really good at her job, but experiences occasional visions that her maker dismisses as glitches. With the help of her second in command Batou (played by Pilou Asbæk), the city seems safe,During one mission, they stop a terrorist attack at a Hanka business conference. They use a destroyed rouge robot to find out that the perpetrator is a hacker named Kuze. Though they manage to catch to garbage men who worked for him, they find that little is known about Kuze. The race is on the clock to find him, only for Major to start considering more about her life before becoming a cop as she does not remember any of it. I'll clarify now that this does not follow the 1995 original movie, but rather Ghost in the Shell adapts elements from it's TV series and manga source to tell something original. This one adapts more of an identity finding story along with the notion of stopping a terrorist. The good news is that the story is goodfor a while. Also like the 1995 original, this can get heavy within it's own world. I started losing interest about halfway in when I was starting to lose track on what the goals were. This I blame on the acting of Scarlet Johansson, who I normally love in other movies, but she is so wooden. Taking the whitewashing controversy out of it, I'd still say the performance wouldn't have worked due to the directing of Rupert Sanders.The film seems to be better at directing the world around our heroes as it looks really cool. A lot of people will probably say that it's a lot like Blade Runner, but consider that it's been a while since we've seen something like this. The action scenes also do a good job recreating scenes from the anime while adding in some stylized fighting. Another problem however is that its 2017. We've gotten a lot of movies about computer hacking and AI identity (such as The Matrix series, A.I., Ex Machina), so what's this version of Ghost in the Shell going to add? Much of the deep philosophy from the anime is removed and what is kept seems a bit redundant and feels like has been said before. I'll give this five anime pictures of Major out of ten. Ghost in the Shell works better as an action movie when not comparing it to the original. I'd still say watch the anime, but you might get something out of this if your just looking for action. This adaptation is a lot like a cyborg; looks good, but lacks little humanity under the surface.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Ghost in the Shell better win multiple awards for all of the mind-blowing work that was put into the movie even on just a 110 million dollar budget.

Their accents and languages just don't flow or feel natural. It's more forced than any movie I've seen in a long time. I wish it was just all Japanese actors or all British it just feels all over the place and no one feels like they belong....nothing flows dialogue wise.But it gets even worse...they ruin the famous intro scene. It's completely different. In APany trailer reviews we saw direct scene from the original so that made fans excited..BUT WITH THE MOST FAMOUS SCENE THEY REWRITE IT ENTIRELY and it's just not as strong. Adding the shoot out action doesn't match the intense sniper scene of the originals opening scene.Then gets even worse and we're still talking about casting...Majors sidekick doesn't have cybernetic enhancements like in the original. Hahahah. There are special effects literally everywhere..but her sidekick who barley talks (unlike in the originals) doesn't even have his eye enhancements.That's all I need to know. You could write a magazine about how horrible this is. I was really hoping this would be BETTER than the original but it's much much worse.Go watch the Blade Runner remake.

SJWs: Thank you for fighting the good fight, but ScarJo looks like Major in the movie, and they very explicitly nod to her origin at some point in the film. Plus there are plenty of diverse characters throughout the movie. Purists: I watched GITS two days before seeing this, and you should chill. First of all, GITS isn't even that amazing (it's great but I need you to settle down), and that's coming from a sci-fi fan who loves cyberpunk and Transhumanism and all that and whose favorite movie is probably AKIRA. So stop docking points from this movie when it's fairly faithful to the original while meeting mainstream expectations. You should really learn to meet producers halfway if you want animated movies to become mainstream and eventually masterpieces. Support the movie. Everyone else: Watching this movie solely for the visuals is worth the price, especially if a sci-fi tech world appeals to you. In that case don't miss it. On top of that, the characters are likable and the plot is more than sufficiently good. The dialogue is fine, not a masterpiece but not cheesy (maybe 2 instances I thought were trash). Although the philosophy is tweaked down, there are still many questions that arise through the dialogue and the characters. The movie itself is a visual exploration of what it is to fuse humans and tech, you will see a lot of whirling trinkets and gadgets. There is one visual failure in my opinion in the beginning, kinda looks like garbage. So I apologize for the disjointed ""review"" and for throwing some shade I was compelled to post out of salt. It's more of an intervention and a reassurance that this movie is enjoyable than a true review. This movie I say is 7/10 but I will give it an 8/10 to balance out the haters because I hate seeing short-sighted elitist weebs stifle progress just so they can stroke their own ego.","13 out of 21 found this helpful.

Going through all the critiques, I really couldn't figure out what does the Anime movie - a fine film, no doubt - has that makes this one seem so bad to so many people apart from the fact that they might be GITS fans. The ""philosophical"" aspects that many associate with the 1995 movie are present too in this movie, but in a subtler way. The main character may not put them in words all the time, but one can sense them through the acting, which is more difficult to do with animated films for the simple fact that the ""actors"" are drawings. The new movie relies also on additional situations that do not exist in the original film but have to do with human relationships, which in my opinion helps in clarifying the main character's behavior and musings. It would be better not to think of this movie as a remake, but as an alternate story, or even maybe as a source of additional information for the original movie's plot. Yes, there is more action and the pace is much faster. The city's atmosphere is wonderfully digitally created, which of course brings to mind Blade Runner, and which, by the way, had a lot of bad critiques too when it came out. Is this movie original? Well... no. The main theme has been explored before several times.

Nothing to do with the fact that it is whitewashed or any of that. It is based on one of the best animated films ever made in a sense that its original material is very slick, revolutionary, philosophical and also unconventional. For example, the Major Kusanagi is a cyborg with a human brain but she does not know who she is deep down. She first of all does not know emotion and therefore doesn't cry or have watery eyes in an emotional situations like Scarlett Johansson's version but yet you feel very connected to the character because of the story behind who she is. And also why cast Scarlet Johansson as the Major and make this movie PG 13. The original is rated R for nudity and some violent imagery throughout. But no you want to put ScarJo in the movie and know damn well she will not get naked but you think have her in the movie will appeal to the masses. Well guess what Production. People are just not interested. I am honestly being objective. This is not a good movie. You don't feel any connection with the main protagonist because her story is not well explained and also oh for people who watched it. The main antagonist actually merges with the Major at the end of the movie and she becomes 2 entities living in one mind. Even that part Hollywood was like nah we are not going to put it in the script because people will get confused. But what was more confusing was the motive of the antagonist in this version. The original does not really have an antagonist it's that simple for people who watched both versions compare how lame the ending is in this one. They just took the original story and switched things around and it makes no sense. Just like Denzel said to Cuba Gooding JR in American Gangster ""you don't have to change anything its good enough the way it is you can make enough money off it by keeping the Ghost in the Shell, anything more than that is greed"" Why not just keep the whole movie intact and not try to put certain scenes from the original in the live action. It is plainly simply dumb doing that because most people don't know Ghost in the Shell. They could have just retold the whole story like it is done in other made to live action film. Great example the beauty and the beast. Why not do it like they did it but no they wanna change the story to fit the masses but it does not work again people are not interested in visual effects as much as they used to. This ain't the early 2000s. They already have their allegiance to movie series in the Marvel Cinematic World, Transformers etc. Whoever was behind this movie production i mean not just the producers but all the people involved failed miserably and it will hurt their pocket unfortunately because like i said this is 2017 people don't really care for these special effects and good looking imagery. People want something cool they can say oh damn this is different and clever at the same time which is how the original Ghost in the Shell is. To sum it all up this movie just didn't do it for me and a lot of people will not care either it's just not good. Even the rating on IMDb will go way down by May it will probably be in the low 5s.3 Star because i am an objective person so i give 3 for the attempt to make a good movie but the plot and essence of this classic had been completely destroyed by Hollywood, again good job for destroying a great classic and oh the director for this movie did not help either you can tell he is an uninspired one. The movie has no substance to it by the end of the movie you just don't care for any of it that's on the director. Even with the script he had he couldn't execute the material.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

In the four minute released clip of Ghost in the Shell (2017), it received praise and changed the minds of many once philosophical questions WERE inserted into the scenes, along with a more modern way of taking the original scenes and Americanizing it which isn't necessarily a bad thing to do. Most of the people are mad at the actors race, and the way the trailer was formatted. But in order to form your own opinion on it you should go out and purchase a ticket. I personally via early screening enjoyed the movie, the mechanics & detail put into the movie is very fitting for a 2017 film, a good chunk is not CGI either. It is very hard to talk about the film without spoiling, but with Scarlett Johansons style of acting it fit the emotionless Major even if it's not a blank stare.

I'm not going to get too deep here, as many people have already done so and I really have no intention of watching this movie ever again, let alone to make notes for a review.I found the movie to be derivative of multiple other works (including Blade Runner and other movies Scarlett has starred in), enough so that it affected my enjoyment level.I personally feel that the CGI oftentimes was not as good as it should have been. If someone is going to release a CGI reliant movie, then the CGI should be top notch. There are times when Scarlett's body was clearly CGI and at those times, it looks like someone else's body entirely and sometimes it doesn't even look realistic. Bad CGI pulls me straight out of a viewing experience, especially when it involves bad physics (which also occurred in this movie).There are plenty of other areas that bothered me and I could nitpick, but reviews are only one person's opinion and you may enjoy this film more than did I. I recommend forming your own opinion, but not setting your expectations too high.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Forget that ScarJo in as far from anything Asian as you can get, or that she is beautiful and a decent actress; she is simply wrong for the part. That the producers/directors couldn't see this pretty much tells the whole story. Why is she wrong? I'll illustrate. Say you want to make Robin Hood. You need a good actor, popular, one that do great action and draw in crowds. You select Jackie Chan or Jet Li, both popular, excellent actors, action people, good looking, well able to do the job. Unless it is a comic film, no one would take it seriously. That's what they did with GITS & ScarJo. Beyond that, their other errors are even worse, since whatever they did to the presentation of ScarJo doesn't make her as interesting or visually sexy and powerful a figure as the animated versions of her previously; they actually made her less sexy! Which is hard to do with a beauty like her. You don't quite get that Major Kusanagi is a real person, a mind and a soul in a robotic shell, but still a person, which provides the essential duality of her character. It's like asking Shemp Moe and Larry to play the Three Musketeers - won't work as anything serious, which GITS is. Very! The story itself is a substantially different story than Masamune originally wrote, which I suppose would be okay if it were anything near as good, which it isn't. They lost, or totally ignored, the whole Asian-Japanese influence throughout the entire movie - it has a different feel entirely, and it is an essentially dumbed down version of the questions that the original story asks. They had a chance to present a popular Japanese story, revered around the world for almost 30 years, and then made something different which is only a shadow of the original. They'd have been much better off making another anime, in 3D cgi, and sticking closer to the story and Asian feel that was in the original.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I remembered the first time I saw that movie better then anything else. The philosophic questions aligned exactly with the way I explored life existentially.This remake is an adaptation, clearly meant for the masses. But, in contrary to other reviews, I think they summarized the core quite well; the question. ""What is a soul"".And for one, I think this is a very positive adaptation, so more people can understand these questions. So they too can ask them self what responsibilities come with technology and what it means to be human. I do not think these questions should be reserved for the intellectual elite. In contrary, we, as a society as whole, are all in it for the long run.Furthermore, they'd manage to capture the atmosphere quite well and the visuals were at times stunning. Scarlet was very convincing as the major. And the right amount of action.I really was scared the movie would be a let down, so I didn't go see it in theater. But now I'm sorry I didn't.This is my first review ever, mostly because I think this remake deserves more positive feedback and attention then it had until now.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

Action should thrill and excite, horror should frighten, drama should make you both weep and laugh, etc.For an action movie to excite, you need tension. Who cares to watch an NBA team play some primary school kids? No-one. No tension. And that's the problem with this movie. At no point in this movie did you feel that Scarlett's character was in danger. All I was watching was an NBA player doing slam dunks over some school kids. Sure the slam dunk looked cool, but it wasn't a ""match"" it was a demonstration.I would highly recommend people go watch the Appleseed movie series. It is EXACTLY what GITS should have looked like: hyperkinetic action with some overwhelming odds for good measure. We have to feel that Scarlett is up against such competition that we are on the edge of our seats.And the comparison between Appleseed and GITS is apt, because the opening scene of the first Appleseed movie is what the ending scene of GITS should have looked like. Both involved tanks, but in Appleseed it was thrilling and tense, and in GITS it was YAWN.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

An audience that never has reflected on the possibility that technology could - or can we say, must? Lead to humans controlling their own evolution? Would that be the last step of humans being freed of the chains of nature? Is it a good thing? These themes are all cloaked in this movie. You need to at least watch the anime to decloak them.

After 55 minutes the movie had a starting point for a plot and it actually caught my interest unlike the first 50 minutes where the only thing that was actually going well was the stunning visuals and cinematography. Honestly one of the best cyberpunk representation ive ever seen. But with that comes normal cars and normal guns which makes absolutely no sense but it seems this movie has a habit for making no sense with the final 35 minute being the opposite of how it started. From nice visuals and slowest plot to the most basic and common action scenes and filming But also the Most rushed ending. Its as if the characters suddenly had a program from they're creator (director) telling them to end the movie fast.Overall:
cinematography/film 8/10
story/plot 4/10
pacing 2/10
casting/acting 8/10
enjoyability 5/10thanks for reading!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The futuristic city design is marvelous, and the movie succeeds in bringing to life - and (arguably) in some cases even improving upon - the stunning visuals of the original anime and manga.I don't usually have a problem enjoying a mediocre movie for its visuals alone, but this one left me completely cold. Rarely have I seen a movie this lifeless, bloodless, sexless, and soulless. There isn't a single human moment in it. No character for whom I felt anything. Despite the presence of Juliette Binoche, who is one of my favorite actors, and Scarlett Johansson, who has been great in similar roles, there is no good acting in it. It's barely even worth it to get into the race-bending controversy or the clumsy attempt to address it in the story.The whole movie feels like a cold corporate product directed by robots. It's all shell, no ghost.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

First and foremost, Ghost in the Shell was the anime movie that changed everything for me. I had 0 interest in anime shorts or movies until someone insisted I check out GITS and that was pretty much the beginning of the end for me. GITS blew me away completely and changed my perspective forever. There is an unparalleled depth to Ghost in the Shell that you just don't find anywhere else in anime even to this day. It remains one of the all- time great anime movies because the direction is brilliant, the acting (Japanese) is absolutely perfect, and the story is just plain epic.Ghost in the Shell 2017 did not fail to deliver. I wasn't actually expecting them to nail every single thing that made the anime so great, but I was expecting them to adapt things as well as they could and they didn't disappoint. It's not the greatest movie ever, it's not the greatest acting ever, and it's probably not going to win an Oscar for anything, ever, but it's an enjoyable adaptation of a great anime movie. Scarlett must have studied Major's facial expressions pretty carefully because she nails those nicely. They also did a pretty brilliant job with all the electronics and high tech gear. Overall a good adaptation of a great anime movie.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

If you dare to take a phylosophical animation masterpiece and turn it into a turd like this, you should be banned from movie making. An story about what is existance has been turned into a basic action pic with good against evil, and in the most horrible basic form. If you want to know what they did to the movie/story, take the scene in the boat of the two movies which is a clear representation of what is wrong with this 2017 movie...from a 3min discussion about what is it that makes us us, to a simple ""i trust you"".For those that say we can not compare them or ""you shouldn't expect the same thing"" I say this: that is total BS...it's like converting Tolstojs ""war and peace"" into a basic ladies romatic pulp novel and still call it Tolstojs ""war and peace"".
Hollywood has a basic mold: we need a good guy, we need a bad guy (if we want to make it shocking we create a bit of confusion about who's the real bad guy). Then we need a lot of shooting and explosions/fighting (preferably with some superpowers) with some last minute rescues, and as cherry on the pie one or two basic ""emotional"" moment, usually love scenes, a dying side kick or reunion with a lost family member/friend.
That is hollywood standard, 95% of the movies fit in this mold. I was in the theatre recently, having to watch all the trailers of coming movies and I noticed: they are all the sameGiTS 1995 was about existence and ethics, about technology impacting society. The chase for the puppet master was the storyline to which it was connected. Maybe it is too slow and contains too much philosophy for these days audiences and the public has been dumbed down too far to appreciate a bit of thinking. Hey, even a basic remake of mad max made it to the oscars...enough saidOh, get lost Hollywood, trying to make a buck by using past masterpieces and mold them into your standard meaningless molds, not being to come up with something creative yourself an extra point for the descent acting and good visuals.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

What is this strange futuristic world like? Do they eat cornflakes, watch Netflix, go for long walks in the park?I have no idea - nobody seems to do anything.We get some cool action scenes -but they feel pointless and the film never gets any less dull.I like Scarlett Johansson but I didn't connect with her character at all. I never really cared about Major, when she got blown-up they just repaired her, and for all the effort it took to save her brain and ""ghost"" she has zero personality - not even a favourite colour.Then, after an hour of emptying pistols into peoples faces, Major gets in a huff because she finds out her boss has lied to her.So she abandons the people who care about her to go on a hunt for a family that she has absolutely no recollection of.I vaguely remember the manga version as being exciting and visually thrilling - this just isn't.Scarlett Johansson is a human being so her body has to make space for things like internal organs. Compared to a stylised anime depiction of a vaguely woman shaped weapon, Scarlet looks fleshy, dumpy and slow - this is not me body shaming its just the reality of the human form.Why use a human to play a robot if you are not going to use the emotional range of the human actor?Eventually the bad guy pulls a big tank out of his butt-hole and we have a fight, which I spent glancing at my watch, until Major inevitably kicked its head in.The original Ghost in the Shell was made in the correct medium and did not need a live action remake - to be honest I don't remember anyone asking for one.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

Since I didn't watch it, I don't have any disappointment about how it compares. The futuristic world created is mesmerizing and unforgettable. The visuals are impressive despite me watching it in 2022. The CGI appears seamless, and it's obvious they wanted to create a breathtaking landscape, so we can be immersed in this future world. The action is great most of the time, the pacing is good until the end, and the music score is satisfactory. The movie seems unfinished because it builds us up and then drops us, leaving a feeling of emptiness.The staff spent so much time on the visuals that the story suffered. Since it's an action film, I have lower expectations than I would a drama but still...can we get more depth? The villain didn't have much of a backstory and their confrontation was lackluster. The character development was lacking, causing a lack of connection, or care about what happens to all the people in the story. Overall, it's entertaining. If you want an action film that's simple, visually tantalizing, and requires zero thought processing, this is it. This is perfect for when you want to watch something and can't decide what to choose, and you're not feeling nit-picky or hypercritical. It's not a masterpiece, and you won't leave questioning humanity.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's a well-rounded and deliberate story of self-discovery, with great action and performances, as well as many themes on what makes us human that people seem to adamantly claim are absent. It's a shame that this movie doesn't get more recognition; even the cinematography alone is a marvel to behold.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

The answer is yes.First off, the soundtrack couldn't be better. It haunts and glows audibly resonating perfectly with every scene. At least it did for me. Nothing worse than a bad soundtrack.Virtually everybody in the future has some form of hardware/software body modification, ranging from the exquisite to the grotesque. If your wealthy and well connected, you can afford the finest. If your poor, there are plenty of slimy street dealers selling modifications much like the low-lives who sling crack and meth in our world today. I found the idea of it chilling and very believable.Next, the mock-ups of life in the big city reek of Blade Runner, but who cares? Multiple level boulevards snake around skyscrapers and 800 foot high holographic advertisements. I wonder if people in the future will simply ignore these monstrosities much like we do now if you are chronically viewing content on sites like YouTube.After her role in the highly underrated movie 'Lucy' from 2014, I felt this was Ms. Johansson's perfect revenge role for a come-back in a similar character. That being a helpless woman forced into impossible circumstances, but eventually sorts things out and opens up a glorious can of whoop-ass on the powers that be.I also found all the supporting characters well developed and interesting. In particular the aging Japanese executive who's weapon of choice is a now ancient six-shooter revolver. That alone was a great touch.Overall a wonderful hour and a half of fun, thrills and intrigue.Child safe, too.","16 out of 29 found this helpful.

The setting of the mana (let alone the anime) makes it clear that it's a hugely mixed-race place, as is common for the genre. The Major isn't Japanese. She, in fact, is very ill-defined as other than a robot.The problem isn't that. The problem is Johansson, and that she's both horridly mis-cast (in terms of ability and presence) and that she's given a poor script to work with. Johansson does Black Widow well, but The Major is NOT some anime-version of BW.It's a much more complex character to act - BW is a reasonably single-tone character with a complex backstory, but the CHARACTER is pretty simple to portray, in terms of how they act/emote. Or perhaps I might say that BW is really a consistent character in terms of how they appear/act.The Major is not - you're looking for someone who can rapidly switch gears between an array of characterizations and ""personality"" types. Johansson simply can't do that, and several of The Major's characterizations are simply out of her wheelhouse.You need someone with the ability of say Cate Blanchet or Jessica Chastain or Charlize Theron. Someone who can be terrifyingly competent, sexy silly, intense, flirty, and even openly self-contemplative, and swap between them between scene without seeming out of place. it's a tough job, and there's frankly not a lot of actors who can pull off that level of range.It's made worse because the film script doesn't bother with much more than superficial resemblance to either the manga or anime before it. And that's NOT a good thing, because the new script is weak, once you look past the flashy visuals.In many ways, this is like the Star Wars sequels and prequels: a lot of pretty good actors, miscast, or laboring under a crappy script. all layered over with distracting SFX to cover the fact that it's actually a pretty blah story.NOT recommended to anyone, particularly anyone with prior experience in GITS media. You'll be sorely disappointed.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Like usual for any film, I just wanted to see it and enjoy it. The film was fine, but that does not mean so good. From the visuals to the performances, it sounded great. But the story wasn't. When the original concept was created nearly 30 years back, it fascinated people for being something new and powerful. But for the current world, for the current generation, it is just an ordinary sci-fi. All I say is it just came out at least 15 years late. So the 90s kids would have loved it!The storyline was nothing, but a self-discovery of a half human, half machine. This has been the plot of hundreds of robot films. But it's just differently told. One of only kind, a human brain was saved after the severe accident and given an artificial body. Now she's known as Major fights the crime. But some day later, she's haunted by glitches in her vision which directly connected to her past that she does not remember. The rest of the film was finding the truth and other consequences, before it all ends.Visual effects were the only advantage for this film to come out in the present era. The rest of the film was simply okayish. I don't know what the original source fans say about it, but it is a one time watchable film. Otherwise, there are plenty of similar good films, like this is nothing much different than 'Robocop'. Or the recent TV series 'Westworld'. Scarlett Johansson could become a reason for some people to peek into it. The writing and direction were average. Watch and forget kind of film.5/10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Batou is flat and lacking the cocky charm many of us have come to love. And some of the character changes out-right counter the key themes of this film. And sadly it does wander down the road of American tendency to spell themes out to the audience. That said, this film had an unexpected level of depth. The trailers for the film appear to have been intentionally deceptive, creating an image of the plot and characters which the film progresses to shatter. 'The Major's' character is fleshed out with additional substance. Scarlet's version of the major stoops unnecessarily, and poses awkwardly while not moving. It seems odd at first, but realized as intentional later on. While the film lacks something akin to the 'intermission' scene from the 1995 film, it still takes time to explore The Major's moments of self examination. It is in theses scenes where the film slows down and allows the audience more time to read. The action scenes are mostly fun, but they too don't stray too far from the central premise and don't overwhelm the story. So much so that the re-creation of the garbage truck pursuit is cut down to a fraction of what it was, giving more time to other plot elements. As for the cultural appropriation? Well, the film uses that controversy and turns it into a major plot point. I'm a little uncomfortable with how they achieved that, but it is very inventive.","17 out of 32 found this helpful.

In order to add some international star power, the main hero – originally Asian – has turned into sexy and nimble white girl (Scarlett Johansson), the choice surely liked by many and despised by some more hard-core fans. And adding some street cred, there is legendary director Takeshi Kitano supporting her. There are– or at least one can perceive – nods to all kinds of mind- bending sci-fi classics that have gone before, The Matrix"" and Assassin's Creed"" among others. The gravity-defying asskicking and futuristic environments sure look good, with all the gigantic holograms dominating the cityscape and everything. Sadly it does not really feel like a living breathing world – it's much more like a video game. So you may not remember it long after watching but it's competent if unoriginal vision of what futuristic looks like. What the fans of previous Ghost in the Shell"" incarnations – especially manga and anime – may lament about is the horribly simplified approach that the western movie makers has used. But if you don't know or care about the legacy, the first live-action movie may quench some thirst for futuristic action. The result is not bad, really. It's just not terribly involving either. It's not gonna become a megahit, because for all the good looks it's too niche for general audience and probably too shallow for manga or anime heads. Oh well. At least we get an idea about how the coming Blade Runner"" sequel and Marvel's Black Widow movie(s) may look like. There's a fully functional spiritual side to the story, and it's actually much more exciting to follow events this way. But all the spiritual stuff has been pushed to the background and is mentioned only in passing. So it can't effectively compensate for the shallowness of the main plot or sure-handed but emotionally distant style which never lets you close to the characters. The potential is all there, but the result will leave many a bit unsatisfied. Watched it in 3D. Didn't think the extra D added enough to justify its existence.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The source material has a large range of stories from anime movies, manga and a animated series. Would it stay true, and yet still be entertaining on it's own?The answer is a resounding 'yes'! The movie and story was based 75% on the original anime movie, 15% on other source material (manga, other movies and the show), and 10% its own original concepts. There is a very intelligent blending of aspects from several of the entries to this franchise that come together to make for something entertaining.To that point... the deeper aspects of the film explores the dynamic of how the connection to humanity could be lost to technology, and what makes us human. And it immerses the viewer in a cyberpunk world that is a visual and action feast.The pacing is actually very good despite what some have said... and at no point do you feel lost in plot or scene transitions. Everything feels believable, just highly technically advanced... and somewhat eerily possible for a future of mankind.Regarding the whole fabricated controversy surrounding casting Scarlett Johansson - The story within the movie actually explains the casting decision. In fact, its somewhat integral to it. And it completely proves that this was a politicized knee-jerk reaction to something that didn't deserve it. I believe this has harmed the box office results unjustly.","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

But I can't say that I am satisfied with the final product.Lets start with the story. It feels messy and weird. This movie tries to get the themes about the relationship and difference between humans and machines, but it just feels shoe-horned in. There are some scenes that really just feel that were placed to make this film more philosophical, the original movie treated its themes in subtle ways throughout the movie for you to get the sense that is real.I must admit, I am not the greatest fan of anime, I do believe that the first one is amazing, but I am not a huge fan. This movie tried to recreate some popular shots of the original, but did so in a very choppy and ""edgy"" way.The action scenes are terrible, they went with the slow-mo kind of action like in 300, and it really didn't work. The weird editing didn't let you appreciate the stunt-work and took you out of the film. Also, some scenes are impossible to keep up with because of all the fast shots that don't let you see anything.The villain of this movie sucked, it is nothing compared to the puppet master of the original. At first, it seemed interesting, but then they went with the classical American twist and a very interesting villain was put to waste.Scarlett is fine as Major, actually the performances are fine and do what was needed from them.The CGI is also incorporated very good into the film, the city looks like the city of the original movie. The only sh*tty CGI was with the major's skin, or in this case ""suit"", it really looked fake.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It begins with the complete miscast of giving the lead role of Major to Scarlett Johansen for the sole purpose of better marketing in the non Asian world. It sucks! And you feel in it in every Scene with her. She does not belong in this movie. Even when you see her as a decent actress, that she is, there are way better suited actresses of Asian origin for this iconic role. It gets even wierder when you see the likes of Great Japanese actor Takeshi to not even bother to speak English. And why would her Mother speak English with an hard Japanese Accent?? It makes this movie so wierd!And there are parts of the movie where they really tried to stay true to the Original but chickened out of it for the female lead?! It really destroyed this movie for me and shows you everything that is wrong in the movie business.The story is still good, but never got me like with the original.If you are interested in this movie, please watch the original Anime, it is so much better!!","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

So I came into this movie both nervous and hopeful. That said, don't let anyone who's a stalwart champion of the anime fool you. The GitS original anime movie is far from the golden standard that people imply. The voice acting for several roles are wooden, the story pacing is disjointed, and the resolution is...weird. The SAC series rightfully disregards this resolution, shores up the deficiencies in voice acting, and delivers two rock-solid seasons. The Arise series similarly plots its own storytelling course separate, apart, and unrelated to the others.I say all this just to reinforce that anyone who balked at some of the core items from the anime being re-imagined hasn't looked very recently at the anime. Nor does any criticism that labels this movie as shallow bear up very well if you revisit the original anime movie.Now, having said all of that, I have to say I enjoyed this movie. It was fun, had equal parts action and story/character building, and did a good job showcasing the dystopian, cyberpunk universe in which it's set. It lifts several scenes almost verbatim from the anime but wraps them in a story woven from a few different plot lines from the originals.Is it perfect? No. I would have liked to see more of the team have a chance to shine, particularly Togusa. I also think perhaps Aramaic is a bit reckless compared to his anime counterpart. And how can we have had a soundtrack without Yoko Kanno or without some tribute to Origa? And I did cringe when the Major used her title like a name or call sign. Nonetheless, it captured the flavor of the universe, provided an entertaining plot, kept the basic personalities of the characters intact, and did a good job with the Major's relationship with Batou. It surpassed what I expected.At the end of the day, movies like this have to do three things to please me: it has to honor (at least in spirit) those elements which I enjoyed in the original material even if it takes liberties with them. It has to entertain with more than just mindless action. And it has to have some heart with the characters. I feel like all those boxes were checked with me.Remember, too, that movies like this, Speed Racer, Pacific Rim, and numerous others don't translate well for folks who didn't grow up with anime. That doesn't mean they're not good. This movie has the unfortunate distinction of missing out on those moviegoers who don't get anime as well as being the victim of a hypercritical that views the history of the show through overly rose-colored glasses.","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

Also, while Johansson is not a bad actress, but she's probably the worst cast for this particular role they could come up with. And they didn't give her much to work with either, in terms of character. I know she's supposed to be an android, but I wonder if giving her that blank, confused stare is the best they could do. Still, the action scenes were pretty decently rendered, and in the end, diocre sci-fi is better than no sci-fi, I suppose.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This director, the producers, cast and studio of this film should all be utterly ashamed of disgracing what is widely acclaimed as nothing less than a masterwork with this flop of a misrepresentation. But the director has proved he is rubbish before, with a similarly spectacular (albeit lesser) failure in Snow White and the Huntsman. ALL THESE PEOPLE HAD TO DO WAS COPY AN ANIME FILM SCENE FOR SCENE ""A LA ZACK SNYDER/300"" AND THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN GUARANTEED RAVING SUCCESS. This kind of outright debauchery is the sort of thing that makes me want to jump on the ageing bandwagon of bashing ""Hollywood"" and the ""corporate sellouts"". PLEASE GO WATCH THE ANIMATED ORIGINAL AND FORGET THIS PIECE OF CRAP EVER EXISTED. What angers me the most is that now we have to wait for the licensing rights to expire before anyone can make a proper redo of this beloved story. It's like the original Judge Dredd with Stallone, they had to wait years to redo it properly in Dredd, which, thankfully, ended up being well worth the wait. Here is a film I would KILL for the opportunity to helm! Here was an incredulous waste of an opportunity to include all manners of nuances down to the acting and thematic elements of a human mind occupying a synthetic body. All that was required was for the director to study his superiors in Ridley Scott's Blade Runner and Alex Garland's Ex Machina and attempt to encapsulate a comparable visual and narrative style by using that to mimick the original animated feature as closely as possible, down to the actor's eye and body movements and framing and camera angles. It strikes me that any amateur filmmaker should have been capable of this. I don't want to know who this flop of a director is related to to have merited such a budget or the right to this IP. You, good sir, are a disgrace to your craft. Sorry, but you simply must do better to ever be worth a damn. Until I hear some kind of rave reviews and critical acclaim of one of your future outings I will avoid polluting my good taste with any more of your crap at all costs.","2 out of 17 found this helpful.

For this live action one, I'm completely understand what is going on, the way they tried to stay faithful to the adaptation and everything. But I think, its a total cliché, we've seen a lot of sci-fi movie like this, when an AI question its creation and origin, fight back and everything. You've seen them everywhere. If they just follow the anime story closely, it will be better. I know the atmosphere in the anime is dark, but this is too dark, even though its just a light story, the atmosphere make it looks heavy. And so the background of the so- called modern city that looks really weird with all the creepy big hologram. I don't think its an adaptation, its just some ""loosely based on"" or ""inspired by"" kind of movie.

I normally review games but never reviewed a movie before. So what changed? The answer is; The hate this movie is receiving for some reason. It compelled me to write a review for it. Let me tell you this movie is brilliant. The visuals look spectacular but this is not just about eye candy. The movie has a lot of substance as well. Story is great. I won't spoil anything but it revolves around a character named Major, performed by Scarlet Johanson. As usual she delivers just like how she always does, both in acting and action department. Other characters are likable as well, and at no point I felt that some character in the movie didn't serve his or her purpose. All of them were awesome, none of them were annoying or boring. The movie has great action scenes as well. They are fun to look at. But at the same time, this movie isn't about mindless action only because as I mentioned above, the story is pretty good at the same time. Soundtracks are brilliant and make the movie even better. Clint Mansell, the man behind The Fountain movie was involved and as soon as I read his name during opening moments of the movie, I knew the movie will have great soundtracks. These soundtracks have dark and futuristic feel to them. It reminds me of Deus Ex games. Overall, the movie is excellent and I'll definitely watch it again, once I have the blue ray version. If you like sci fi movies, don't miss this one. Just keep an open mind about it, especially if you've watched the original. Keep it in mind that this is a different beast. You'll love it.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

So heres a 10 to balance out all the 1s. Finally a well done rendition of an anime and people destroy it, this is why both blade runners made no money and Alita made no money and godawful spiderman films get 10 ratings because post malone is in it.

So I feel that I can judge the merit of this movie without overly relying on comparisons to its predecessor. Far too many times good movies get smashed simply because people watched them with the wrong set of expectations, but I don't think this one is such a movie. GHOST IN THE SHELL is genuinely boring and utterly ill-paced.The new GHOST IN THE SHELL takes the landmark animated movie and turns it into a live action flick, with Scarlett Johansson giving us a convincing performance as a cyborg longing for an understanding of herself and her place in a futuristic world. The plot meshes mystery thriller with a strong theme of corporate greed.While the ideas are just as interesting as they were in the original, the movie has some severe pacing issues. It starts out with a blast. The colorful neon vision of the future sucks you in right away. Within the first minutes, I caught myself thinking ""This is it!"" Prepare to have your jaw dropped on at least a few occasions. But then the movie slows down. And, oh gosh, does it slooooow dooooown!Sometimes too many things happen in quick succession, many times, however, not enough happens at all. For the most of it, the movie plods from one techno gibberish conversation to another with no clear progression of ideas and quite frankly, not a lot of depth. As the story proceeds, too many loose threads are just left hanging, with no integration and no pay-off that brings the different strands and characters together in a convincing way. A lot of the side characters next to our protagonist have massively underdeveloped personalities, and the villains do not convince. It's not quite clear why people do the things they do, which is disorienting and ultimately leads to disinterest.Moreover, movies that depend on a very unemotional main character have the problem that they often fail to arouse emotions in the audience. Of course, Scarlett Johansson is supposed to play a robotic character... but this is a story purportedly about her quest for meaning, so we want things to be at least a tad bit emotional! The main character's roboticness prevented me from having any strong feelings for anything that happened on the screen. This was perhaps a shortcoming of the original as well, but at least there the movie made up with a stronger focus on cyberpunk ideas and much more emphasis on world-building and atmosphere.Now, I am not going to talk about the utterly ridiculous white-washing that happened with the casting decisions—many others have complained about this, for the right reasons. But I believe that even besides these ideologically questionable production decisions, GHOST IN THE SHELL does not warrant a lot of attention. It is a piece that is stunningly beautiful but that is, ultimately, absurdly empty and pointless.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

"10","/10","A review from an old man still loving GITS","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3676452/?ref_=tt_urv","vercingetorixofgaul","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur74625235/?ref_=tt_urv","2 April 2017","Unfortunately, the younger generations have taken a rather overly critical view of this film, this is unfortunate because it may keep new audiences from experiencing the GITS world.It saddens me to see a film like this as low as 6 stars, and I have given it a 10 star to hopefully help boost it up a bit. I will address criticisms that I have read so far in reviews.Atmosphere: The atmosphere of the original GITS series and 1995 film was captured excellently here. Older more attentive fans will notice music keys and tones from the original series and movie, as well as some call backs to the 1995 film sequences. This is affected by some semi-immersion breaking advertisements for Adidas and the like, but let's be honest, we are all used to that in blockbuster films by now.Casting: Scarlet Johansson did an excellent job bringing the character of Major Motoko Kusanagi to life as if straight from the Manga I first read when I was 17 in 1990. The argument of ""white- washing"" is a complete nontroversy and waste of time, something that interestingly was only bothersome to viewers that weren't Japanese. ""Beat"" Takeshi Kitano is THE man to play Aramaki. The casting for Batou was definitely my favorite of the Section 9 team, but the casting for the rest of the team was excellent. I would have loved to see more of them, but you can only do so much in a just above standard run-time movie. Story: I will avoid spoilers here so we won't get into much. The movie does an excellent job of bringing this classic Japanese story to an American audience in a palatable and mainstream available way. I experienced the originals first hand when they were new and this is on-par with them for the time it was constrained to. Everyone seems to complain that their favorite story arc wasn't included or something to that effect, but you simply cannot fit the nearly 30 years of GITS story into 107 minutes. The reason everyone, in my opinion, believes that it doesn't capture the story correctly when it really does, is that they are comparing it to 30 years of writing. 107 minutes will never be able to compete in that comparison. Critics and users alike are guilty of this false comparison. GITS deals with some very serious moral and societal issues, this movie touches the surface of that but refrains from diving straight into it, and I firmly believe that if it had dived in as some say they wanted it too, their complaints would have still been complaints, but they would have said the movie tried too hard to handle the issues the manga and 1995 film did. Conclusion: If you want to enjoy this film, you will. If you don't want to enjoy this film, you won't. If you are looking at it through the nostalgia goggles of 30 years of content and expecting it to stack up to that, it won't. Nothing can. GITS is an amazing piece of work that has been built on for years and years. No one movie, no matter how perfect, could ever stack up to it. However, I believe that this film takes as good a shot at it as any and truly sets up the GITS universe to be available to a broader more mainstream audience. The movie has set itself in a position to leap into those story arcs that fans are demanding. In order for me to consider this a success, sequels are a must because it has clearly set itself up to do so. It does sadden me to see people claiming to be fans of the GITS series that want to selfishly keep the series to themselves and protest sequels to this excellent film because it didn't in its 107- minute run-time meet all of their expectations built over 30 years. I ask them to take a step back, and view the film again, without those expectations, and see what it is capable of doing.","17 out of 33 found this helpful.

I'm a major devotee of the original (and have watched it countless times), and this is the third incarnation of this film (I'm including the redux version), so it was always going to be hard to see this as a stand-alone. It was inevitable that this would be marked against its peers, and meant a hiding to nothing for the creators.From the off, it's clear that they decided to not play it safe, but opted for a loose recreation of the original, preferring instead to make their own parallel storyline which little seems to mirror the originals. That is a major loss in this case, and what was most celebrated about the first movie was its existential arc (which was like an extension of what Blade Runner had been attempting). I don't even think the existentialism that is even in this film matches the original's attempts in any way.This film instead relies on the action and special effects, and even though the action is enjoyable, it's the philosophical touches that made the original interesting. They even cut out the realpolitik and espionage stories which were intriguing in the first film. In reflection there were many strands in the first film that have not been carried over.The action and special effects are good, but in this day and age of CGI it has been much copied since the original came out long back. You even just need to see the opening credits of the recent 'Westworld' TV series to see where it got its influences from this film.The backdrops, the meandering flights through the cityscapes and the academic dialogues. All that seems to be lost (although the city views in this are still beautiful). Granted the makers of this version wanted a more accessible movie, but a bit of courage would have meant that they could still have kept those elements listed to introduce the universe to the viewers, and then expand on them in later films (this should have had the legs for further).As for the choice of actors, the 'white-washing' furore has been covered in detail heavily already by many others, and I do sympathise with it. Regardless, even without that charge, I just don't feel that some of the actors fitted their roles well, and some of the newer characters were poor. The chief was nothing like he was in the original but more just Takeshi Kitano, and I'm not sure that Cutter was anything but a 'Robocop' style cut-out corporate executive villain.I could say more, but best leave it there.As a standalone it's not a bad movie, and has points to commend it for, BUT it's not a standalone movie. It has the uncomfortable act of following on from a well watched and respected anime classic. It very much misses the mark for me.Many who are watching this without having first known or seen the original will likely accept this more than those who have watched the original. We'll just have to lump it, but if you did like this version then please take my advice and check out the original, you'll be blown away by it.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

This however is an ok movie that you will probably watch once and then leave it to collect dust on the shelf as it should. More- Btw the reason video game movies, this movie, and the star wars flop havent worked these past few years is because hollyweird does not respect the original content.

"3","/10","In an attempt to be true to the anime series, Ghost in the Shell fails to be a decent film.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3677027/?ref_=tt_urv","texshelters","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17472655/?ref_=tt_urv","3 April 2017","Ghost in the Shell: pure anime, and that's the problemIn an effort to look like an anime story, ""Ghost in the Shell"" (GitS) ends up looking like a cartoon and not a live feature. From the beginning, the CGI looks, well, cheesy. It is terrible. 1982's ""Blade Runner"" had a better look than GitS. The best effects were when the filmmakers used real sets and enhanced them with CGI. Perhaps if you are 13, you won't mind. You might actually enjoy that it looks like a video game with out-of-date graphics. For older audiences, the cartoonish look stands out.So it looks bad, so what, you ask. The dialogue is also as bad as much of Japanese anime as well. I couldn't keep up with the terrible lines, writing in the dark of the theater. However, I am sure the writers had a book of clichés for the script, or perhaps they just borrowed from the anime series. The acting is terrible, even Johansson as Major. It's a terrible role, and I must admit, I have never seen her as a great actress, just a good action star. She has no chance to be good anything here with the terrible material she is given. There are two standouts: Takeshi Kitano who plays Aramaki, Major's boss and Michael Pitt who plays Kuze, the criminal Ghost/Shell. Pitt is creepy, endearing, sympathetic and dangerous. He and Kitano are the two winners in this fiasco. Did I mention the music. At least some bombs have great music, but here, the music is overwrought and unoriginal. It's as if they stole that from the anime series as well or were told, ""Hell, just throw something emotional in there, it's got Scarlett Johansson, no one will notice."" Well, when almost everything else in the film is below average, we will notice the terrible music. Rating: I want my money back. A half an hour in, I was cringing at the look and dialogue, the incoherent plot elements, and the lack of back story for the near future world. This might have been better as a TV series. And by the lack of an audience, word of mouth won't save this film. Peace, Tex Shelters","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

I have DVDs of all the animations, and watched the first movie when it came out..*many years ag0*Its hard to make a live action version of a good anime/manga, and this is a pretty damn good effort. But apart from that, it is a good standalone science fiction movie.
The effects are amazing, The actors great, and the action scenes are very well done. It's got Beat Takashi in it...and Scarlet Johahnson is a great actor, and one of the best action actress, and generally a good drama actor as well.There is a lot of talk of whitewashing. Those who truly know Japanese animation, and the source material will know tow things (1) Tha Japanese do yellowwashing all the time (Asian actors playing white characters (2) The main character, Major Motoko, swaps into robotic bodies and she uses western bodies. This was said by the creator of Ghost in The Shell, the great Masamune Shirow, who approved of the movie.My main problem with it is the plot, and the ending isn't that great, but overall, it is an amazing piece of work, visually stunning.

It seems sensible that if you have more money to spend on film production it would make for a better movie. It is very arguable if this is true and sometimes it even seems that some films would be better with a lower budget. I certainly think Ghost in the Shell would have been a much better movie with a smaller budget. This would have forced the focus away from the visuals in favour of the storyline and script. The concept of Ghost in the Shell is both very interesting and timely. The brain of a person is captured and integrated into a robot. The robot in question is Major played by Scarlett Johansson who seems to play a lot of roles in a catsuit for some reason. Whilst the concept is very interesting and something that will no doubt be possible in the future the plot is dull. I suppose some people may find the endless shots of the future cityscape entertaining, but it seemed rather pointless and irrelevant.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Background= they've created similar image background that tells what year and technology we can base it on, the only job they did it fine.
World Detail=The point of this world was cybernetic prosthetic body booming after the wars, so the detail should be looked closely to present, unfortunately this movie didn't, the emotions and movement physics wasn't respecting what the background set out to be, the posture, action scenes, did not consider any of it above and feels tacky and wasted actor's potential.
The main character is an elite programmed half cyborg, did the film make it believable? weapon/martial arts choreographers? nope they made it like armature holding guns and have no training to make action scenes believable. 
Effects=both practical and 3d effects could've done much better because there are films out there doing much better and was created over 20 years ago, this film ignored above world detail and weren't able to present the correct visual effects either.
-Not memorable in any ways. 
--Adaptation from original source?----what made the original series interesting without the philosophical part, the brief intro that should be taking account when making this film----The original series's world background. 
After great wars resulted cybernetic prosthetic body booming, crimes has gone to a different level, criminals with military grade prosthetic body and cyber crimes are the new waves of torture after the war, and needed more public security than a typical police officer's human body and mare guns to protect the innocent.The main protagonist, was injured and needed full prosthetic body at very young age, as she had the time and chance to develop what others couldn't, perfection control of cybernetic prosthetic body, she experience through years of wars as a military solider, thus being called the Major in ranks, female gorilla in her brutality ways, Wizard in hacking specialty, once she left military after the big wars ended, she formed an elite team specialized to fight against new type of criminals, that's where the the main focus of the story, she fights with precise weapon control and knowledge, understanding of cyber prosthetic body to take the upper hand, and use of hacking skill to use opponent's advanced against them, [and in this animated world, visual effect was easier/cheaper than real pictures depending on practical and 3d effects, but they didn't slack it, did it respectfully and convincingly with physics and detail shown, you can feel her emotionless cybernetic face and eyes almost like a robot, brutality and the prosthetic body's weight crushing the surroundings, weaponry and physics detail carefully presented to make it believable, also her past as a solider to perform above actions as a logical background. 
And after the incredible thriller and action scene, it goes further deeper when she often gets involved in cases that make her/and is question human nature and the truth she seeks, and here we can relate to this mystery roboish lady because we might have the same question as her as a audience experiencing the story it's telling , but that's a whole other story.And if you think the above listed original series background is interesting, you should give it a try. 
But I do not suggest the adapted film, it's a literal disrespect to even be called a sci fi film and a waste of resource.The adaptation ignored all above factors that could make it a success, with badly presented world detail, visual, effect, compare to what similar budget sci if movies adapted from Japan e.g Edge of Tomorrow, whilst changing character background to ruin their own chance to make it logical and presentable, overall it just feels like a low budget tacky sci fi wanna be film, trying to grasp even the littlest fame and success that made the original series by throwing random original series moments into scenes yet tacky and unprofessional, and didn't make any effort to present a story that has nearly all winning factors they could've copied and used. The grossing numbers won't lie about people's feeling in comparison to other great SCI FI films, it's a failure and hurts both the original series's image and their hired actors.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

First and foremost, it never stood a chance in being praised for its visual presentation. The 90s version was a marvel of animation that didn't resemble any other movie of its time, while also looking far more detailed than any other animated sci-fi movie in general. The new version on the other hand, just looks okay. Not so much because they didn't work much on the visuals, but rather because you can find a hundred other movies just like it. It doesn't stand out as much, because nowadays we get lots of CGI-heavy movies. Something I do not blame it for, is having a different storyline. A good remake does not try to have the exact same plot and themes as the previous version. The 90s movie was not a faithful adaptation of the 80s manga. It was a beacon of the time it came out and was dealing with the issues of that decade in that part of the world. The 00s Stand Alone Complex tv-series is also its own version and has its own themes, relevant to the time it came out. Now imagine how less interesting it would be for the new movie to try copying any of that after a thousand other films were already inspired to do exactly that over the years. It would feel completely derivative and passable. Thus, having its own storyline is not a bad thing. The problem is, despite being different from any other in the franchise, the new storyline is still not special because it's also something that has been done a lot over the years. It took a far more mundane Hollywood action flick approach, where the heroine has a dark past that needs to be revealed, the corporations have evil representatives you can just shoot, and problems can be solved by just blowing them up. There is nothing deep or subtle in any of this. It can work for a movie such as the original Robocop, which has the exact same plot if you think about it, but even there it had to be presented as an ultraviolent satire of capitalism. The new Ghost in the Shell just wants you to take it seriously with nothing worthy of being called serious or special.The biggest disappointment is how it's not inspiring. It's not trying to expand to themes of philosophy and religion like the previous versions did. Motoko does not have an identity crisis based on who she wants to be, she simply has amnesia and wants to remember who she was all along. That is not the core motif of the story. The whitewashing of the protagonist is not the actual issue here, despite everyone making a big fuss about it at first. That could have served the narrative for a setting where race and gender are fluid. They can switch bodies and replace parts of them with cybernetic implants. What's the problem with having a Japanese person inside a Caucasian-looking body? The actual issue is the movie not exploring that concept, so it can have and in-story excuse for the whitewashing. The core theme behind the whole concept of Ghost in the Shell, was always an identity crisis. How much of you, is still you when you can change bodies or you can replace organs with machines. 
-The 80s manga gave emphasis on how the body can change with cybernatics to the point it becomes a sexual fetish, since the mangaka was that sort of guy. 
-The 90s movie switched the emphasis to transhumanism, and how mankind can move to a different state of being or how programs can gain conscience.
-The 00s series switched the focus to sociology, and how technology changes the way people can live in a world where technology keeps them in touch all the time.Now tell me what the recent movie explores regarding that. It's not like we don't have material for identity crisis in this decade, where everyone can be someone else by playing videogames, are liberals are constantly pushing gender fluidity in mass media and entertainment. This movie does no theme exploration regarding the identity crisis of our times, so it really comes off as a lazy excuse for having a white actress playing a Japanese character. It doesn't connect with people like the previous versions did, because over there Motoko was just another cyborg, while in this one she is one of a kind. If there are millions more like her, she is not special, the body switching and the race hopping feel like an everyday thing in that world. This doesn't show when you have a prototype, more advanced than any other, able to do stuff no other cyborg can do. And to put it bluntly, people didn't like the previous versions for the pew-pew and the bam-bam. It was never a type of story aimed for mainstream audiences that seeks thrill-rides. It's mesmerizing for its themes and atmosphere. It's not meant to be entertaining like a mindless action flick, or relatable for having fleshed out characters you can identify with. The 90s movie is very dry in this regard. But so was 2001 Space Odyssey, and Solaris, and the very first Star Trek movie. You don't watch those films to have fun while eating popcorn and laughing with your drunken buddies. You watch them as an existential journey, where you are supposed to ponder about stuff. The only thing you ponder while watching the 2017 version of Ghost in the Shell is ""how did they not get this?""","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

I thought this movie was imaginative, compelling and had jaw droppingly awesome fight sequences.

I couldn't think of any real criticisms. I have honestly never seen a more under-rated film in my life. This is a solid movie. I honestly don't see any glaring flaws in this film. It didn't even remind me of Lucy and vaguely familiar characters that Scarlet has played. It had it's own identity throughout the entire film.It lived up to all of my expectations and stayed there throughout. The poorly translated Japanese philosophical conversations from the original aren't present, their meaning, significance unlike the original, are not over stated in the film, the movie is thought provoking but doesn't spell everything out for you. But, if you're not retarded and can think on your own...it's more or less all implied. For any one capable of actual intelligent, independent thought, it should all be mostly inferred to them. There was no need to complicate inherently very simple concepts that were originally made to seem more complex than they actually were. If you watched the original, and are capable of deeper thought, you probably saw through the fluff...The original is weighed down by pseudo intellectual babble, which tries to make the subject matter appear deeper than it actually is. ""Any intelligent fool can make things bigger and more complex... It takes a touch of genius - and a lot of courage to move in the opposite direction.""E. F. SchumacherThere's a lot of fluff in the original anime, pseudo intellectual dialogues that are poorly translated into English to appease the pretentious anime watcher. When you cut through it though, it's really not that mind blowing. Neither was the Hollywood adaptation, but it was thought provoking...and if you were actually paying attention, it explored the same ideas as the original anime, some times without even saying a word. As a film, the casting was near perfect. I loved the entire cast, and each cast member were on their A game. The characters were all believable in their roles. The visuals were stunning! The story was compelling, thought provoking and evenly paced. Everything the original anime set out to explore, make you phantom, so does the Hollywood film, given you are capable of thinking...and don't need any one to hold your hand. The action was also perfect, very evenly paced. I can't think of anything this film got wrong, did too much of, or did too little of. This is the most under-rated film I've seen in a long while, that was no doubt attacked for a ""white wash conspiracy"" created on false pretenses... This was a terrific, beautifully made, wonderfully acted, thought provoking science fiction film. It deserved much better reception than it received.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

There's some moments to be enjoyed, some story to explore and some great visuals, but by the time the credits were rolling, Ghost in the Shell showed it's as dull as it is pretty, devoid of any legitimate depth or feeling.The film immediately presents a simple, but intriguing futuristic premise, very Blade Runner-esque, which was a bonus for me despite the obvious similarities. As the movie progresses, the plot thickens slightly and remains faintly engaging, but never once did it pull me in to the point where I was dying to see the next scene, the next revelation. The plot twits were underwhelming and the pacing was sluggish. I found it difficult to become invested in the main narrative, despite the more enticing setting and atmosphere. This is largely due to the disconnect between the main plot and the film's set of characters, between the two of which never develop any kind of profundity, never resonating with the emotional side of the story.This is where the film suffers the most, the writing and portrayal of pretty much every character in the film. The characters are all lifeless and shallow, not an ounce of emotion was sparked during even the most serious, heartfelt scenes. This issue is twofold; one, the writing, which gives the characters corny and uninspired dialogue. And two, the acting. Every role, including lead actress Scarlett Johansson's Major, is nothing more than a cardboard cutout, bland as can be. There's no believe-ability in hardly any of the dialogue, the delivery of most lines are boring and unexciting. Ghost in the Shell tries to create characters to care about, but the execution was a complete misfire.What the film lacks heavily in writing, character development and acting chops, it somewhat makes up for with some cool action sequences and eye-popping visuals. The cinematography is quite wonderful, and the sci-fi setting paves way for equally wonderful atmospheric tones, centered around the futuristic style. Despite her less than admirable performance, Scarlett Johansson's Major is fun to watch during her big action scenes, and the supporting characters, notably Major's sidekick Batou, deliver on helping make the action scenes feel exciting. Anime to live-action adaptations are always a tough cookie to crack, and though I have not seen the original anime, I have a feeling there was a lot missing to this live-action version. Ghost in the Shell is a prime example that amazing visuals and some high-powered action scenes can't hide ugly writing, terrible characters and truly awful acting. The movie's title is, in the end, a perfect way to describe it; there may be a gorgeous looking shell on the outside, something to keep you distracted, but on the inside, it's nothing more than a ghost, hollowed out and baron, devoid of an identity or a soul, and this holds Ghost in the Shell back from being much more entertaining than it ended up.5/10","1 out of 11 found this helpful.

It is evident how hard the movie team has worked to bring this complex story on to the big screen and they deserve praise for that. I felt right with the mood of the decaying, gritting future city and the general mood. I liked Aramaki's character, what a bad-ass and the relationship between Batuo and Major is well explored. My only gripe is with the villain, it was too weak. The tone and story is dumbed down to make the pace going as this is an action flick but it still touches that philosophical mark that the original is all about.

I am not entirely sure who was the target audience for this film? The fans of the source material have absolutely annihilated this picture with scathing but well-founded reviews. On the other hand, the uninitiated have discovered the universe of the Hanka corporation and its dubious plans for mankind.
Being a fan of the original film, its sequel, and short forms, my disappointment was justified: terrible casting (besides Takeshi Kitano and Juliette Binoche), simplified plot losing all philosophical subtleties of the original material, the amalgam of shot-for-shot references from the original were a good addition but pointless.
At a time when we get smart science fiction films like Arrival, Interstellar, Inception,... why the filmmakers decided to dumb down the story. Was it for the sake of western audiences? The original concept is unique and asked so many ethical and philosophical questions about cyber technology, religion, self-awareness, how far should technology go and how much should we depend on it. The 2017 version simply heavily signposted these deep meaningful questions and didn't bother capitalizing on them. Wasteful!
The only redeeming aspect of this pointless, white-washing remake is that it makes you desperately want to watch the original material.
If you want to watch Ghost in the Shell, go watch the original, please.","1 out of 16 found this helpful.

This is typical of Hollywood I suppose, they tend to underestimate their audience so everything has to be spelled out in case someone fails to grasp the meaning. I appreciate their inclusivity but it results in some seriously dumbed down movies. Case in point here is the insistence on explicitly explaining that the ghost in the shell is the soul of the human whose brain has been implanted in a robotic body. Like, if you need that spelled out to you I don't think movies with substance and subtext are for you.

Instead this iteration of Ghost In The Shell can be seen as a prequel; an origins story that chronologically sits before the anime. It fills the gap between the time when the protagonist was just a plain girl and the time when they have become the slightly detached, mature and hard-boiled Major Kusanagi.And with this, the film works really well. Long-time fans get to know the background of familiar characters such as the Major and Batou (including how he got his eyes) without mulling too much over the already familiar philosophical questions. And newcomers into the Ghost In The Shell universe get an exciting ride and a more easy-to-digest introduction compared than the heavy mind-jobs that are the previous ones. As such it works well for both camps.The visuals are excellently crafted, retaining the mood of a high- tech future, where human and machine are becoming blended into one, along with the grit and grime that have become a hallmark of franchise. The environs are completely credible as an image of the future, the characters are believable, and the action is amazing without being needlessly outdrawn or becoming cheesy.The only thing that prevents me from giving this film a full 10 is that they lifted one too many scenes from the original, in an attempt to appease the fans. Had they gone fully with making this an origins story, I would have been happy. But that small flaw is easily overlooked. Be kind and see this as a prequel and as live-action's first tentative outing into the Ghost In The Shell universe, and you will not be disappointed.

"9","/10","Go and see it and decide for yourself if you like it or not. If reviews are turning you off ignore them!!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3682768/?ref_=tt_urv","galloglaoch","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur54124193/?ref_=tt_urv","11 April 2017","This is the first time I felt the need to write a review but the failure in the box office of this movie hurts me immensely and add to that the dominantly negative attention it's gotten I just couldn't stop myself from coming here and offering another point of view. The movie is really good for what it is and I do mean really good. Not mediocre... REALLY GOOD. Yes it's nowhere near the anime film but it's not what it's supposed to be. If you honestly expected the anime in live action you are your own reason for disappointment. With that being said let me clarify that this movie is not a masterpiece but keep reading and let me explain to you why it's really good. (I will not talk spoilers)First of all Scarlett Johansson was great! I really don't understand the whole buzz of her not being Asian. We had a pretty good female lead and she acted made the role hers. If there is one criticism to be made it's that her Major is not as robotic and synthetic as the anime one and this in fact recreates the character but I don't think that's bad. I actually felt more connected to live- action Major than the anime one.(granted we're not supposed to feel connection with the anime one) She was great in action scenes she was great ins scenes exploring the philosophy of the movie. Also the movie had a clever way of explaining her not being Asian, well played movie.(I liked it at least) Second reason why the movie is great is because it carries the philosophy of the original. Yes it's simplified but it makes you think! It's not a dumb Hollywood action flick, it asks many important questions the original asked, it misses some but it adds a new twist here and there too. The ""villain"" is not as good as the anime one(in my opinion) but it's a pretty solid one and a lot better than what we get in most movies nowadays. I've been told this character appears in the anime series(I haven't seen them) so perhaps he's not inherently worse than anime movie one but just supposed to be a different character altogether. Anyway the ""villain"" made you ask questions and that's the important part.Visually the movie was stunning. This is how the best sci-fi films should look like and it was incredible. Add to that Batou looked great(and played great), the villain looked great and in the third act there is a thing straight out of anime that looked great. Add to that the great soundtrack and you get a great treat for both your eyes and your ears.It's getting too long so I'll cut it short. Overall it's not the best movie ever made and it's not as good as it's source material but that doesn't make it bad. I actually think it's pretty good. Anime adaptations are definitely on the right track. Unfortunately it seems we won't be getting a lot of them because us anime fans keep on hating on anime adaptations because they are not exactly what we want and in my opinion this is childish. Live action Ghost in the Shell definitely honors the anime and if anything it opens the door for new fans. I wasn't planning on watching the Stand Alone Complex series but now I will because now I like not only the anime movie but the live action one as well so this makes me want to dive deeper into the philosophy and ideas of the source material. I feel this means the movie did it's job and I'm happy I saw it and I'm proud to stand and proclaim I wasn't disappointed and I rate this movie very highly.(Menaing I don't consider it a guilty pleasure)In the end of the day it's something you yourself should decide if you like or not. Really it depends on your taste. You might not like the philosophy, might not like the setting or you might enjoy it.What I'm trying to say is you need to watch this as a stand alone sci-fi movie with it's creative decisions and themes. Only after that you're allowed to place it in the universe the source material created back in the days. I'm certain we need and deserve more movies like this but it seems we make it impossible by letting this gem suffer in the box office. Thanks to this prejudice we're unlikely to get a good anime adaptation anytime soon. If you are a fan of the anime don't walk into this with prejudice, let it be it's own thing and treat yourself to a good movie and decide if Hollywood got it right or wrong.If you have't seen the anime and the only reason you're not seeing it is because reviews... ignore them, you never know what made this person write it. He might be wearing his dark tinted glasses or his pink tinted ones. I ain't a one to tell you that you MUST watch it and you must like it. I'm saying, give it a chance! I'm giving it 9 out of 10 because it satisfied everything I wanted to get from a sci-fi movie, the only reason it's not a 10 is because I can't lie to anyone and say it's a perfect movie. It has flaws but it's merits out weight them. This movie deserves a chance to impress you, don't let someone deny you a thought provoking flick. The best part is after you finish, if you like it there is a whole universe of it in anime form and you are free to explore it.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

Pacing was also very good - at running time 1 h 45 min this movie never dragged. Visually this film looks stunning, kinda reminded me a bit of a ""Blade Runner"". Performances weren't that good, best were by Takeshi Kitano and Pilou Asbæk. Michael Pitt - actor who enjoy a lot was not enough used in here i think, and Scarlett Johansson - this is not the performance she will be remembered for - it was just OK.Overall, i did enjoy ""Ghost in the Shell"" more then i thought i will.

However they massacred the story, dumbed it down to a level that is not engaging but understandable so the average or slightly bellow average person will ""get it"" and consume the product with little to no questions.
The origin story in the (live action) movie for Kusanagi was probably the most stupid and lame choice, completely loosing the spirit of the original and making it on the same cheap story level, much like 95% of current TV series running on most known services.I view this as a fan remake of the original source.I think you did enough Hollywood.

The first minutes are gobsmackingly beautiful and captivating; pulling the viewer to a fascinating weird world, a dystopian reality of captivating extravagance much in the vein of the landmarks like Blade Runner and Total Recall. As soon as the first action scene comes to a close, the film starts falling apart slowly, never quite recuperating any of its initial bravado, shamelessly freefalling into a pool of clichés (the eye-roll-inducing-kind) that ultimately make you stop caring for the characters, the action or even the setting. Yes, even all the praiseworthy designs and atmosphere become tiresomely repetitive. As for the much publicised whitewashing of the central characters, I'm not one to embark into absurd politic discussions; for a source material that is not necessarily ethnic-centric, it's not the whitewashing that's worrying, but how blandly and cringing it is delivered.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

I'm a great admirer of the original anime, I thought 'Ghost in the Shell 2' was great as well, maybe a bit too sophisticated, but still great. And now here's the live-action remake.In an era of lukewarm remakes and reboots, here's a movie from someone who not just understood the original anime, not just made by a fan or admirer: It breathes 'Ghost in the Shell'. Actually, to call it a remake is insulting. What can I say, it was perfect (and if you don't already know, movie ratings represent the average opinion of a bunch of kids).The plot is somehow a mix of the two anime films, centering around anti-crime investigation team Section 9, lead by the fearless Major. They are entangled by a mysterious omnipotent hacker, who holds a grudge against the industry of Cybernetics. But then the Major begins to remember her past.The story doesn't quite have the cold perfection of the original anime, instead it manages to add an emotional dimension, that wasn't there before. It's like the animation was brought to life (I know it sounds tasteless).I thought no matter what, the ending couldn't be as epic as the anime. But I wasn't quite right, well, see for yourself. Scarlett Johannson was damn cool, and so was the movie.","15 out of 32 found this helpful.

But the way it was written and delivered doesn't work or sell this idea. She is an a actual human inside, acting as if she was made into existence and hating it. So, unlike a robot that is given a purpose that is not questioned, she ponders too much and seemingly hates it. It's also too fast paced and blurred in this regard.. the ideology, impact and weight of this trauma and concerns is hollow and utterly simplistic. They certainly didn't get the core, nor could they replicate the depth of the story they tried to copy.Why so much change to such a great story? Adapt it properly instead of dumbing it down!! And why does Scarlet slouch so much? Why does she act emotional at times, and stares into nothingness like a doll in others? Even the inconsistent way in which she walks pisses me off..

When Major discovers that Kuze (Michael Pitt) has set up his own rogue operation to destroy several people in her section she decides to hunt him down. However, when Major eventually tracks down Kuze he tells her a few home truths which make her begin to question who she really is and who she is really working for....It's fair to say that Ghost In The Shell probably borrows quite heavily from a lot of films, but both visually & in the way it presented its world it reminded me a lot of Blade Runner (the way the camera pans round the city and the striking visuals amidst the tower blocks and skyscrapers did feel reminiscent of Blade Runner). Plot wise the films are different (although perhaps with some overlapping). Anyway with that observation out of the way I'll crack on with some further thoughts...To start with the positives; the film looks great and some of the special effects are pretty impressive and the way that Scarlett nicely fills that 'shell' is also hard to ignore, but beyond the superficial I didn't find a great deal about this film that's worthy of much praise to be honest...Despite appearing to be interesting at the start the film soon becomes rather clichéd and obvious; the fact that it seems to contain strands of many science fiction films from yesteryear certainly doesn't do the film any favours. It perhaps wouldn't have been as bad if the film would have either been exciting, fast-paced or fun (which may have acted as a distraction to the obvious plotting) but the truth is that it is none of these things and unfortunately it does take itself far too seriously and the end result is something that is far less worthy than it thinks it is.OK to be fair a serious story told in a serious manner can work, but this can only work if key components exist within the story (such as depth, intrigue and characters that one can care about), but the honest truth is that you get none of this here. For example; there is absolutely no character development afforded to a single character (there is a slight arc with the protagonist, but not really enough to make me care). Hanka Robotics and their experiments aren't elaborated on in any great detail; I think we learn that 98 people have been selected for their programme, but why were these people selected? There is a modicum of intrigue at the start of the film, but this soon becomes dissipated and takes a fairly generic turn. Many of the characters are uninteresting and one-dimensional and the lack of depth afforded to them does make it hard to give a damn about them or anything that happens to them.I'm not really sure what else to say; it's a pretty film with a bit of action and a bit of soul-searching, but it doesn't amount to very much. It never quite falls into the realms of being boring (the director moves things along well enough for it never to get that bad), but at the same time I just had this feeling of indifference about the story and the characters all the way through the film which sadly meant that I didn't find it particularly enjoyable.","0 out of 16 found this helpful.

As adaptation/remake of the 1995 film classic Ghost in the Shell it's incredibly bad. This movie is more of a remake of Robocop than Ghost in the Shell because the story is manly about the main character contemplating who she is or was, essentially origin story with revenge.It's like writer and director of this movie were given a buzz real of the original films and TV series and just yelled out lets do that. There are lots of nods/Easter eggs to the original films and TV series but the film lacks any understating of plots in them. The only thing this movie really uses from the original films and TV series are character names, scenes (re-mixed, remade, and out of context) and surprising one musical track from the original film. 
 
The movie is slow... pacing is bogged down by many scenes of exposition. The environment and state of technology in film is more in line with game Deus Ex: Human Revolution. This because cybernetics are still new and society is still on the edge of excepting it, unlike original Ghost in the Shell where cybernetics and full body replacements have been a way of life for decades. The film pounds down that the main character is the first of her kind but in the original was one of many.There is so much this movie does wrong then right lets just sum it up:The visuals are not bad but are jarring at times where CG and real sets and people collide. Its not at a level where I would say you could just watch this to just look and the effects.
The soundtrack is forgetful and does nothing to drive the story.
The story is very basic, uninspired and doesn't challenge the audience to think.Bottom line if you are in for good cyberpunk movie or a fan of Ghost in the Shell skip this and go watch the original film.","0 out of 9 found this helpful.

The script, though intriguing and well-paced, feels incomplete, as if only the baseline was written and the rest was just filled up with a bunch of cliche garbage. The characters and their motives are particularly hollow, while some dialogue lines are strikingly lacking in subtext, unveiling the mystery the audience has been exploring for so long in a dissatisfying and simplistic manner.However, what it may lack in these particular fields it makes up for in its more technical aspects. The directing is not only consistent, but also original, deviating from the well-known and beloved western style, and embracing a more energy-based, Japanese approach. The cinematography, despite barely utilizing color schemes, works excellent combined with the meticulous concept art. The sound (effects) and editing are solid as well. But where the movie really shines is, you guessed it right, the visual effects. From the intricate tiny face implants to the highly complex damage effects or the vast procedurally generated cities, it manages to remain consistently top-notch, both technically and visually.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's a fine line in having to stay true to the original, yet making the movie palatable enough to engage the newbie viewer.For me, it was enough of the story line coupled with with amazing cyberpunk eye candy. I thought it was amazing. I frankly find it funny that a white actor is so harshly critiqued for playing Major, despite Mamoru Oshii, the director of the original anime adaptation, endorsing it.That's like telling Monet that he needs to add clarity to his impressionistic paintings, or telling Bach that it's all about the bass.Seriously, go in with a clean slate, and you'll enjoy this movie. I look forward to more adaptations, and hope Scarlett entertains a William Gibson film like Neuromancer. Dare I say it, I could even see her playing Frank Miller's Ronin.

In the anime a lot of characters are white. Also, people seem to fail to consider that a ""shell"" wouldn't have an ethnicity.I watched some of the movies on Netflix recently and this movie is pretty true to those. People say the main character doesn't have a lot of personality, and perhaps they're right, but that's true in the anime as well. The personality comes from the other characters and how they interact with her. Granted it doesn't explore character personality as much as it could but its not a short movie and I think it crammed in a lot. This movie does offer some new ideas and can make you wonder what life would be like if/when manufacturing ever got so good that we could manufacture body parts or entire bodies for ourselves. That said, this is definitely a sci-fi action movie. If you've actually watched some of the anime recently, I don't think you will find this to be that far off. It has the same strengths and weaknesses.Long story short, this movie has a decent plot with solid action and amazing visuals.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Some call her a machine, others call her a weapon. A few years ago, she almost died because of a serious accident. The shady corporation Hanka Robotics extracted her brain and planted it into a synthetic body – an empty vessel. Now Mira fights cyber crime for the Japanese government. A mysterious Hacker by the nickname of Kuze seems to be the key to Mira's past. A frantic chase through dystopian Tokyo ensues. But does Mira really want to know who she actually is?Mamoru Oshii's ""Ghost in the Shell"" from 1995 is an anime and sci-fi classic: It is visionary, artistic, exciting and meaningful. The prospect of Hollywood remaking such a masterpiece is bound to raise some eyebrows. I was sceptical myself. But Rupert Sanders' 2017 version of ""Ghost in the Shell"" pleasantly surprised me. Of course, if you think of the original as the Holy Grail, you might as well not bother with this new movie; you're going to dislike it no matter what. But if you watch it with an open mind, you will soon realize that it's not as horrible as it's made out to be. In fact, it's a pretty great movie.Oshii's anime is deep and philosophical. Sanders' real life version is not. Which is fine by me, because Sanders succeeds in giving the source material (that is, Masamune Shirow's manga series) another emphasis: an emotional one. It is all about the feelings of the protagonist Mira. Oshii's ""Ghost in the Shell"" might be a masterpiece, but there's no denying that its protagonist Major is more a shell than a ghost. In the original, Major ceases to be a person – she dissolves. In the remake, it's the exact opposite: Mira gradually becomes a person. That's a great twist to refresh the story we already know and love. I for one was spellbound by Mira's quest for identity.This movie has some obvious flaws. The script is wise enough to stay away from the musings of the original. But the few times it tries to be philosophical, it is painfully trivial instead. The villain is a paper cut-out. The visuals are impressive, but sometimes they're a bit too shiny for their own good. But other than that, there's much to enjoy. They recreated many iconic scenes from the original, which is great fan service – for the most part, anyway. (Remaking the stunning opening credits from the original is a hopeless task.) Scarlett Johansson is amazing as Mira Killian – a real action star. Speaking of action, the fight scenes in this movie are as spectacular as they're stylish. Here and there, Sanders is able to give the imagery an artistic touch I wasn't expecting at all. Plus, there's Takeshi Kitano being a total badass. Yay!""Ghost in the Shell 2017"" provides interesting, thrilling and emotionally charged sci-fi action. It might not be the most original movie ever, but it is an admirable effort to do the original justice.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I also thought Scarlett in this was total babe and made my eyes hooked even more.The only reason why I diddn't give this movie a 10 out of 10 has to do with the extremely confusing beginning-middle I had zero clue what was going on for bit till finally the movie explained everything properly and made alot sense.Other then that I highly recommend this movie don't listen to negative reviews and watch for yourself.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

However, I think the film missed so much of the depth of the story. It's visually fascinating but, shallow in everything else. Nice try, though. What could possibly make this movie better? For starters, they should not have attempted a remake (or close to it) of the anime. They should've created something based on the same setting with different characters altogether, and maybe add cameos of some of the original characters in some scenes to draw the anime fans in. Then, they could've titled it ""Ghost in the Shell: ???? (add subtitle there).""Scarlett Johansson is good in some of her films but, this one was just not for her. No, I don't think having a Japanese lead was necessary (of course, many fans might expect that). I just think they should've picked a different actress to portray the role (no offence to Scarlett Johansson fans)--someone who understands the character she's portraying much better. Of course, it possibly could be the lack of direction on the set that made her portrayal disappointing.On another note, I think what makes things worse is the dialogue/script in some scenes of the film were not very good. The dialogues could have been polished better.Overall, it was a decent attempt. Nevertheless, it would have been better if they wrote a different story with different characters based from the original setting.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

If you've read any other reviews for this film, you know that the critics would flip flop what I said about the second and third acts. And critics are idiots, so that's why I'm here.*Before I go any further, I need to put in this sidenote. I won't be addressing the controversy of this film about whitewashing for 3 reasons. 1) It's a claim made my idiots that made up their minds about the film well before it ever reached theaters. B) It's actually a really easy claim to refute and prove wrong. And 4) I'm simply here to discuss the merits of this film and give my recommendation on whether you should watch it or not or hopefully provide a different way of seeing the movie if you already watched it.* As I said from the beginning, this movie has a strong start. There's a bit of reading at the beginning to introduce cybernetics-basically telling you to be prepared for cyborgs; after that, however, it jumps right into this futuristic world without trying to explain things too much. It wants the audience to accept what's happening and learn as the movie goes along. It's a smart approach that really elevates this film. What obviously also stands out are the visuals. But it's not just that you get a shot of the futuristic Japan and all the digital billboards and upgraded technologies that gives this movie its impressive visuals, it's the fact that they make sense. When Section 9 (all you really need to know is that Scarlett Johansson is a really powerful cyborg with a human brain and she's working for a company that built her, and her and her coworkers are part of Section 9) analyzes a crime scene using virtual red laser technology, it feels like an approach that is both convenient and useful-something that isn't always seen by the overuse of holograms in other films. Throughout the movie, ScarJo experiences what are called glitches when going through the real world because it's like repressed memories from her life as a human coming to the forefront. I'll discuss the merits of the plot later, but I added it in here because the glitches are a clever way to have shots of the real world and incorporate visuals directly into it, and they are one of the more intriguing mysteries of the film. The biggest issue of Ghost in the Shell is how one-note it gets. The digitalness of everything is really cool at first, but it loses a little appeal after awhile. What ends up being criminal in this film is the score and background noise. It's the same droning sound the entire time, and it takes its toll on you. And in the middle is where a lot of exposition is given with a ""twist"" as to whom the actual villain is. The thing about it is that lots of the characters are essentially cyborgs, so there isn't a whole lot of inflection in their voices. When you pair cyborg voices with the annoying score, it creates a muddled middle where you should paying the most attention but instead are at your most distracted. The third act is able to pick itself back up a bit. I'll talk about movie comparisons later, but this is really where the movie tries to find its most humanity and philosophy. Although it doesn't stand up to the deep thinking of other films, it's still more refreshing from all the exposition and subpar story development from the middle act. Oh, and don't expect the most tension or action from the climax; the action is there, but it's just a by-the-numbers climax scene. Inevitably, this film is going to draw comparisons to Blade Runner-emphasis is on the humanity behind the cyborgs and not the action itself. The difference is that while Blade Runner cleverly toys with morality and what it means to be human; Ghost in the Shell feels more like an empty shell than anything else. The ideas are presented, but it gets lost through the high budget effects. There's nothing wrong with having a large budget, but if characters aren't properly developed, it nulls any meaning. This issue is more apparent in this film due to the poor writing. In particular, a couple one-liners are thrown around that are groan worthy (""I wasn't built to dance!""). Overall, the ScarJo main character Major is fine, and I have no issue with her human's background story that is gradually revealed; my problem comes with both the supposed and actual villain. Neither of these characters are well-written, and they both have motivations and arcs anybody who has seen a movie can guess right from the start. The worst offense Ghost in the Shell makes is one that will probably be overlooked by most. It succeeds on many levels of creating an interesting world; however, this world is populated by dull characters. There isn't a distinction made on why we should pay attention to who is a cyborg, who has cybernetics, and who is purely human. It doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things, so why should we care? And the answer is that we don't really care, and we won't be very compelled to hold any discussion of this film after watching it. This movie isn't a bad watch-in fact I kinda liked it-but there are so many obvious mistakes that could've easily been fixed that makes me upset by the final product. Oh, and to end on a properly irrelevant matter, if you're like me (which you most likely aren't), then you would've noticed that the Asian guy from The Dark Knight that's all like ""As I said, I'm good with numbers"" makes an appearance in this film.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

Perfect. The story was as expected, slightly simplified, compared to the anime, but it is catering to a mainstream audience. I particularly loved batau and the Major. Scarlett played her so well. ANd the characters were true as can be to the anime, so anyone disparaging the characterisation is obtuse IMO. It's way better than my expectation of a Hollywood remake of an anime like this. A lot of anime has totally random and disjointed story lines anyway, so standard Hollywood scripting is fine. I loved this movie, I want to re-watch it, just because Batau is so badass. Nothing would be good enough to please all the fanatic basement dweller nerds, and self-satisfied armchair critics who think being hyper- critical makes them intelligent--they obviously can't understand the uniqueness of this film.

Her brain has been transplanted into a completely synthetic body, making her the first example in human history of her kind. She is then employed by the government to stop the world's most dangerous criminals, one of which starts to arouse an identity crisis in her.I have never been exposed to this story having never read the original comic nor seen the original anime, my take on this story was completely new and fresh. Whilst it hasn't left much of an impact in me to further any knowledge on this mythology, it still left me fascinated enough by its world to have a decent time at the theater.Whilst many have defined this film as visually spectacular I take issue with that definition, especially if assigned to this film. ""Ghost in the Shell"" has many things going for it, but I guarantee you that visually stunning isn't one of those. The editing and cinematography of the picture are quite unfocused and pretty much follow the rhythm of many generic blockbusters. Sanders might have a great eye for design and world building, but he has a really hard time in deciding when to cut and how to progress the visual grammar.The story is pretty derivative (I understand it is an older story, but in modern day there is no fresh update) and many elements in it feel derivative too, many of the gimmicks employed in the action scenes and the story beats feel very familiar. And over this familiarity Sanders builds a film that doesn't have much style to spare. He doesn't have the bravery to hold on certain shots, to cut with thriftiness. The action scenes have no grit or tension to them, they are assembled with generic cuts and slow-mo. There are no breathtaking shots or ingeniously choreographed sequences that make the world built in the film stand out. At no point does the film manage to gather intensity and make realize you are clutching your seat tightly.Sanders does have a good touch for character but he struggles in giving the feature an original or fresh touch, there is no style applied to the story: many elements try to come into the picture, but almost none of them manage to have much relevance. The electronic score never manages to find its place, the cyber punk undertones never stick out as interesting, there is no unity to how the sequences are built, each one has a different rhythm and it all ends up feeling like pretty CGI and random editing.Fortunately the packaging of the whole movie overall isn't in anyway terrible or void of interesting ideas. Firstly the cast is well chosen and whilst the relevant characters are five at best they all manage to stick out and make an impression. They all have a dynamic that's personal to them and that evolves through the film's structure. It also suits that all the actors mold into the world seamlessly and give us performances that manage to make this world's implications and ideas grounded and believable.The design and art direction of the film also help it incredibly in making an impact on the viewer. As I said before some of it might be derivative and the references or quotes of ""Blade Runner"" might be a little too many, but there is so much going on and so many characters and places that it is hard not to be somewhat enchanted by them. It helps that the CGI and the practical effects work together beautifully here and just as in his last feature Sanders excels in making a polished picture with unnoticeable CGI and solid effects work all around.""Ghost in the Shell"" sadly fails as a medium to introduce worldwide audiences to anime and manga by not imprinting any style or freshness to the Sci-Fi genre, favoring a traditional and unfortunately bland aesthetic in the editing of the picture, but it sure has enough pop to spare for at least making an impression.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I can't think of any other reason why she would agree to participate in this mess. Ok, I am at a little disadvantage here; I am not a fan of movies made from comic books. I think a film should present some form of intellectual challenge, else it tends to be a waste of time. Nor did I see the original, but I see from the reviews here that it wasn't really necessary.

The story line and some of the character development choices miss the bull's eye for me, but I can't say that they are bad or wrong. It felt like to me that instead of taking a chance on making it completely true to the complex concepts of self and humanity, that they took a chance on a less complex story in hopes of grabbing more seats.They chose to emphasize the Major over developing the team work aspect. The source material has the advantage of numerous episodes to explore the teams unique personal qualities, so I get that they have a limited amount of time to use to fill out multiple key characters. The Hollywood approach of focusing on the leads and deemphasizing the team saves time and generally results in a personal movie. I hope that they get the opportunity to make a sequel to fill in more of the characters. The sound of the movie is very good too, and keen ears will have noticed themes from prior sound tracks. The end credits are a delightful call back to the original movie. What makes me sad is that it's a very good movie that got whacked by bad press.

And of course this assessment is subjective (despite of i'll try to be objective as much as possible)Ghost in the Shell (disclaimer: i never watch the anime version)Story: 7.5/10 I love the way Major digs her memories through the mission she performs, the surprises of the reality ahead, and the way Major manages it. All the story plot describe very clear and help viewer to get the point of the story, why Major does it, etc. It brings the viewer has the Major's confuse-depressed emotional, so we can enjoy the movie from the story side.Graphics: 8/10 Graphics is fully intense by the future of a Japanese city, make viewer enjoy the breathtaking of the scenery.Additional Genres: Action: 6.5/10 Scarlett Johansson, well-known actress by her action, did great job in this movie. As a human- droid, combining with future war technology, Major gets her action becomes 'something' of this movie. Even though only a few action scenes (which make me give 6.5), i enjoy every one of them.Sci-Fi: 8/10 Viewer will find a new, awesome, imagination about future technology by watching this movie. This criteria is supported by the movie's graphicsAverage: 7.5/10 This is a great movie to watch, Story, Sci-Fi and Action are well combined in this movie.For advice: always empty your mind and think the movie will be great before view every movie, so you can enjoy it as you're looking for","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

As someone coming to the film fresh, as many will, I thought I'd try and give a different, and maybe more mainstream perspective. Its beautiful. Disturbing. Ethereal. There's a decent story, the actors are fine, but the heroes of this film are the sets and costumes. Yes, we've seen similar in Bladerunner, and that film influenced many others, this one included. But here the filmaking technology of today allows a fully rendered glimpse of the future of tomorrow. It felt like being inside a William Gibson novel. It really worked for me. The technology felt real... And just around the corner. The whole movie sometimes slipped into video game cut scene territory, but that fits with the whole is it real, is it virtual, is it human, is it enhanced, is it a robot theme of the movie. A quick word about Scarlett Johansson... Again, I've seen many negative reviews, saying she's wooden in this movie. She's not. She's subtle. She underplays everything beautifully. Perfectly for the part. Should an Asian actress have been cast? Probably. But they weren't, and Ms Johansson did a good job. To sum up, if you're a fan of the anime original, you probably won't enjoy this movie. If not, and you see it on a decent screen, you probably will.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Mainly because this was made only
aimed for the fan base, and not for the mainstream audience. So I don't think
many people will be wowed or blown away by this. Besides it's forgettable, you
won't remember anything from it in a day or two.Rupert Sanders the director, I think since he came from a visual effects background, only cares about that stuff only, and not the characters. Which is a shame because I think the movie would have been much better if he did. (Now this is just pure speculation at this point). As for the guy who played Chief Aramacki, he was OK but he should of spoke in English because all of his scenes are awkward.Scarlet Johansson was pretty good as The Major, she was kind of cool and very sexy in her therm-optic camouflage suit which makes her look naked. I felt she was the best out of the cast, the actor who played Batou was OK but I felt he didn't bring much to the roll, he didn't make the character his own, I can tell stuck with the script.Overall I still liked it and would watch it again, It's just a forgettable little action movie. I do feel strongly that fans deserve a REAL Ghost in the Shell movie someday, but I at least felt that this was a nice try, even though it was a box office bomb.I give it a 5.1/10 not great but it's decent to watch on a rainy day.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Such is the anime community sigh*. That being said i'd give the overall rating of this Film an 8/10. It's absolutely visually stunning with great special effects which really give it a similar/same atmosphere as the original ghost in the shell although a bit brighter and colorful. Having seen Both Original Ghost in the Shell series and Movies, I think this live action adaptation did the best job possible in terms of bringing the anime to life. Much of the live action is very much the same as the First 1995 animated Movie a few tweaks to the storyline made but with the MAIN Iconic action scenes still intact. Anyone who gave this movie under a 6 was simply coming in with expectations waaaaaay to high as there's no way we were gonna get an exact replica of the 1995 series to think that would be naive. Overall i would recommend you see the movie for yourself and gain the best experience viewing it in 3D as i found it more immersive for this particular film/genre.","13 out of 28 found this helpful.

I understand that not everything can be incorporated in the film because the source material is super large, complex and rich. I just have a problem with the unnecessary changes and the absence of the section 9 team dynamic. It's not all about the Major. Like the last airbender could have been a 4 or 5 movie story, GITS has an even bigger potential.So....
The major having a human brain instead of cyber brain... Why would you add the most fragile thing of the human body and put it into a super powerful cyborg body? No mention of her having highly advanced defence and attack barriers is such a missed opportunity. Her wizard class hacking skills are not displayed at all. Her entire struggle with being synthetic is so exaggerated and should have just been a side story or left out.The strange Aramaki/Togusa hybrid...messed me up. A gunslinging action hero that for no reason speaks Japanese. Not the master strategist and Political liaison he should be.Batou's ranger eye implant story change, so sad. Why would you change that? They should have just gave him those eyes from the start of the movie. So many body mods seen in this movie, it would not have even been necessary to even explain it. Instead they choose to incorrectly add it into a part of the story, why? Complete waist of time.Ishikawa, Saito en Borma are unrecognisable, not introduced and barely have any role. None of their specialties are shown at all breaking the entire section 9 team dynamic. And leaving out the tachikoma's is just a crime.I expect Rupert Sanders hasn't seen the anime series at all. He hasn't captured what this story and these characters are about at all.If they would have done the homework and then done this movie right, this could have been an amazing movie franchise.Now this movie is just a blender slushy of bits of fragmented flimsy story with some amazing CGI and Props mixed in, to try and save it. Mind you, without those CGI and props, this movie would not be worth watching. Such a missed opportunity.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I watched a few clips from the original anime prior to seeing the film just to have a point of reference to compare, but was largely unaware of the previous story lines.When this movie is taken at face value, it is a coming of age story that focuses on the Major. I though ScarJo did an outstanding job and the supporting cast was tremendous as well. The visuals are stunning and the attention to detail in the set design was outstanding. The storyline is not as complex as the original material, but it wasn't trying to be. The complexity of the plot is still miles ahead of most films made in the genre and I loved every bit of it.Bottom line, please attempt to see this movie with an open mind and take it at face value.

This film delivers and it's one of the most visually stunning sci fi films ever made. The team of thousands who worked tirelessly to respect the original source material and craft a new version of the story have knocked it out of the park. Yes I would have changed a few things here or there...but I believe credit should be given where credit is due. I haven't seen this level of Hollywood craftsmanship since The Dark Knight. I saw it in IMAX 3D and felt like it raised the bar on what a 3D viewing experience could be. Not since Avatar...have I seen 3D work so well.The music was spot on and the visual effects teams made something special. I felt the acting was nuanced and well played throughout. The director nailed it.Scarlet contributes a meaningful performance to the franchise. I believe we should be sensitive to diversity in Hollywood. For those on tear to destroy a work of art...I feel they've picked the wrong movie to demonize. The major's character has an android body...it was manufactured.The point isn't her race...it's actually the opposite...it begs the question, ""what does race even mean if you've become a robot?"" From the articles I have read...the Japanese public was more angry about a Chinese actress playing the lead in memoirs of a Geisha. Now that is a case I can understand and have empathy for.The world is full of trolls and haters. Don't let them ruin this amazing movie for you. It's special and deserves a major thumbs up.","12 out of 26 found this helpful.

I'd like to begin by addressing those people who are upset about the casting of Scarlett Johansson. First off, calm the hell down. Johansson is perfect in the role, and helps bring a real emotional heft to the story. Second, if you actually take the time to WATCH the film instead of being an overly-sensitive and judgmental toolbox, you'll find that the franchise's Asian roots are far from ignored. In fact, they're celebrated. Scarlett Johansson is magnificent as the Major. Every one of her line readings is spot on and dripping with emotion. As a side note, I don't believe she's ever looked as beautiful as she does in this film. The supporting cast is just as good, but famed Japanese auteur Takeshi Kitano steals the show as Daisuke Aramaki. All of his scenes in the third act were greeted with cheers and applause at the screening I attended. I was very glad to see Kitano in a big budget American film, portraying the type of character that he usually does: Calm, violent and awesome. The film's visuals and cinematography are two more pieces of brilliance. Director Rupert Sanders only previous directorial credit, Snow White And The Huntsman, looked good. But Ghost In The Shell is the movie that solidifies him as a truly visionary filmmaker. I've never been overly fond of 3D in film, but it's used to stunning effect here. I also have to take a moment and praise the writing. The films themes tackle poignant issues of self identity and what it means to be human. Yes, such issues have been done before, but I've never seen then addressed as well as they are here. All in all, Ghost In The Shell is nothing short of cinematic magnificence. If you don't see this one, you'll regret it. 10/10","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

As someone who has seen Gits, Gits2, Gits3 and 1st and 2nd Gig all I can say - IT IS GHOST IN THE SHELL...To find out what is Ghost in The shell one needs to look for it's cyberpunk inspiration roots a bit deeper, maybe look a bit at Blade runner. The original Manga of Gits was written in 1989 and I do believe the author was inspired somewhat by Blade Runner.... What did these two had in common? It was Atmosphere!!! An atmosphere of this computerized robotized future world where people are very similar to robots and robots similar to people.Now if you look at this new film as an old GITS fan - it does not add anything new to the story, but it keeps the main elements intact with quite a deep precision. I think pretty much every key scene of the original anime film was added to the new film, the story had some differences however, but overall feeling stayed the same. Scarlet is a perfect actress for this role, the funny thing is though it is not a role or character which required to show deep emotions... The only scene that disappointed me was the spider tank battle, it simply lacked the dynamics that the original anime had...Overall it's a nice sci-fi action film with neat looking cyberpunk environments, even in 1997 it wasn't revolutionary ideas wise, but the sci-fi elements felt much fresher back then, if you go to watch it as a GITS fan you will be OK with it, if you go to watch it as someone new to GIST universe, well that's a decent introduction...","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

People act like it's a movie full of only caucasians. (hint: it's not)A major corporation in it can easily be seen as an American corporation, though, which would explain the 'whitewashing' anyways. That isn't far fetched... Perhaps they should have made this a prominent thing. Perhaps that would have helped? Probably not, they'd get slammed for that as well I bet...It is a shame that it was hurt by this. I was concerned going into it, but was pleasantly surprised. Maybe I enjoyed it because I didn't go in expecting it to 100% live up to the originals or S.A.C.? It did a better job than I was expecting. Maybe I enjoyed it more having enjoyed them. Also likely. I would like to see more, but without it having a strong opening, that probably isn't going to happen.For those that feel it was 'dumbed down', people not familiar with it wouldn't really know what is going on and why some of the scenes were even included. As it is, it really should have explained more, but yet really couldn't have due to length.I'll close by asking this: Why is it 'bad' when ethnicity is changed by Hollywood, but not China, India, or Japan? Do these same people complaining about 'whitewashing' complain about other people doing what is essentially the same?","8 out of 16 found this helpful.

Nothing could have prepared me for the immersion and dystopia of the senses that brought home so many important issues of the technological age. The acting was far better than expected, the script was believable and the visual effects were stunning. I've not seen a movie about the future that touched me so much since Her. As we are nearing the age of cybernetic enhancement this was the perfect psychological thriller of how our consciousness might be transported in the future. The urban landscape created by the film was haunting and the story built up to an amazing 2nd half of the film, with not poignant but colossal insights into the very core of the human condition. The movie retained some of it's ""Asian feel"" that greatly improved the overall impact. While it had elements of ""Hollywood"", it's core features transcended any transhumanistic vision Hollywood could spawn. I have not been philosophically moved by a film of this magnitude in quite some time, an instant classic in my sci-fi obsessed voyage into the future. The layers to this movie are deep and other-worldly and yet so intimately near when we consider how fast technology will exponential change the human condition post 2025.","11 out of 24 found this helpful.

Having seen all of the anime and manga source material it can feel a bit weird to watch some of the scenes, as they took a lot of iconic scenes and character names from the previous movie/series and incorporated them into a new plot.I think the most noticeable change from the previous adaptations is the way in which the story is told. They basically shove the plot into your face sometimes! Which I expected from Hollywood. I can forgive that, as I know this movie needs to appeal to a much wider audience as the anime series/movies.The acting is solid, but nothing extraordinary or Oscar worthy. The visuals and soundtrack on the other hand are really well done and make the dystopian city believable.All in all I think this is one of the better if not the best anime adaption made by Hollywood until now. And surely the best cyberpunk movie that has been released in recent years. I would recommend this movie to fans of the anime as well as lovers of sci-fi and cyberpunk in particular.","11 out of 24 found this helpful.

The visual effects were astounding, especially if you consider that the movie was based on the cartoon in which there are no limits. In this regard the movie is even 9 or 9.5 out of 10. But I gave the overall score of 8 just because in the end it is a rewritten and adapted version of the original and the Hollywood always considers larger masses and not just the fans. I believe that most of us that saw the original years ago had the more time for the story to settle in and as time passed the connection to the story got stronger. So when we watched the movie it is perfectly normal that not everyone has the same opinion regarding the movie since most of the opinions are subjective and not objective. Personally for me the adaptation was done pretty good, considering all things that they had to put into the film to pay tribute to the original and to appeal to larger masses. In the time that the movie goes on (a bit under the 2 hour mark) they squeezed pretty much all the important parts and made the scenery from the original very real with the visual effects. Watching it in the IMAX surrounding was great and all the city scenes were like nothing seen before. That is pretty much it regarding the movie story and scene. Now a little about the main character... Scarlett was great, and I really mean great. I think (and I may be wrong here) that she didn't read the manga or that she saw the original animated movie but she captured the personality of Major pretty damn good. In playing a character that is a cyborg and in the same time a first of it's kind she gave a great performance. It was just so in line with the Major from the original as I wanted it to be so maybe I'm a little biased.In the end, go and see the movie, I promise that you won't be disappointed. In the sea of Hollywood mainstream movies lately I found it quite good and fresh. If you're a type of viewer that doesn't care too much on a movie giving an homage to the original you will definitely find it interesting since the story like this didn't came before and all the Hollywood things like good acting and stunning visual effects are there.","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

As a fan of the 1995 anime movie I have been looking forward to this film. I thought this adaptation of the story was very intriguing both visually and philosophically. Sure, some of the complexities from the original 1995 version have been simplified, but let's face it, the 1995 anime film is not for everybody. Johansson appears to have really taken her character seriously and I felt more depth to her character than I felt with the anime Major. I think this new adaptation will reach more people and hopefully get folks interested in the source material. If you are looking for a live action copy of the original, then go back and watch the original. If you enjoyed the 1995 GITS and the thought provoking concepts and issues it illustrates, then I believe that you will love this film as much as I do. I will be taking my kids (teenagers) to see this movie and enjoy an evening of discussion that this film will stimulate.

As for the films based on anime there isn't much to look up to and I would love to see other titles treated with as much respect as this one...(cough) ""Dragonball Evolution"" (cough)... You can really immerse yourself into the world of GITS. It is visually beautiful. If you've seen the anime you'll easily recognise the places and characters, and that's just itself so enjoyable for the fan of the original. The plot is changed, but still familiar. The themes are not as deep as in the original, but let's be honest how many people would go to see a SF film based on anime if they wouldn't make it easy enough to digest for a regular movie-goer? I see it rather as a single step (finally in a good direction) and deeper themes may be introduced further along the way. Look how far the comic book movies got, and how acceptable it is to be a fan of them nowadays. Give this film a chance whether you're a SF/action fan, Scarlett Johansson fan, or a fan of the original.","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

I have read some articles that compare the two works, and also refer to the comics series, as well as to 'Matrix' which took apparently many ideas from it. It seems to me that I can enjoy and appreciate director Rupert Sanders' film even better without that comparison, although I may be missing some of the nuances or different directions the original work was taking the theme to.What may have changed in the two decades since the Japanese original works were created is the fact that much of the technology that is described in the film became reality, and for the rest the feasibility is a confirmed fact. Artificial organs are now more and more replacing organs and tissues damaged by diseases or accidents. We know much more about how brain functions, how information circulates between brain and body, and how mechanical actions of the human body or artificial prosthesis are controlled. Brain transplant was not achieved, but it's considered feasible, as well as a future implant in a completely artificial body. As in the film, many of the humans are or will become hybrids with a higher and higher percentage of replaced parts.The film deals with a future in which the first brain implant is made in an artificial body. This makes of the lead heroine (Scarlett Johansson) kind of a super-hero, a living weapon to fight terrorists. It's just that her former identity (her 'ghost') comes to haunt her, and while she slowly recovers her human identity the reality around becomes less connected to the truth. What follows is a combination of action (or even super-heroes action) and smart science-fiction genres, which takes place in a world where men coexist with hybrids, or maybe better said almost any man also became a hybrid. It's a film which succeeds both to entertain as well as to ask difficult questions about the future evolution of mankind and it's relation with the thinking machines created by men.Some exceptional work was performed in order to create on screen the possible world of the future described in Ghost in the Shell. The visual concept makes reference to previous art like the one in Metropolis or Blade Runner, but develops those into new directions starting from the images and shapes that define today's Asian big cities. There are a lot of computerized effects but they all have logic and are backing the story line, and so do the action scenes. The film succeeds to satisfy both action fans as well as viewers who are looking for meaningful science-fiction. Scarlett Johansson is very good in the lead role, she continues her daring undertaking of roles in science-fiction movies, but each one of the roles is different and this should help her avoid automatic casting in a new stereotype which replaces the older beautiful-fragile girl one in the first years of her career. It's a pleasure to see huge actors as Takeshi Kitano and Juliette Binoche also involved in this project.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

All the media about Johannsen not being right for the part and it should of been a Japanese actress was way off the mark, I've never seen the original version so didn't know the story and the fact that the film answers this critical point itself was enough for me on that subject. Ghost In The Shell was totally immersive, visually stunning and beautifully produced. The rendition in scene was incredible and a feast for the eyes. The story was strongly relayed even for a novice to it as I was.

It means I can come at Ghost in the Shell without preconception or expectation. I can see many cinematic influences, and accept that the greatest influence of all will have been the original, but it is not there in my memory to colour my impressions of the film I saw tonight.Cinematographically we are in Blade Runner territory, the near-future dystopian cityscape created by Ridley Scott by way of William Gibson, a neon-lit eternal night of wet streets, flashing kanji logos, littered alleys and animated ads. There is even an ad for the long- defunct Pan-Am, a direct nod to Blade Runner. That said, Jess Hall has done a magnificent job in creating a brooding and entirely plausible world, CGI holograms producing a gritty, disconcerting surrealism, a trippy might-be of militarised urban evolution.The story is told in linear sequence. In a culture where the cybernetic enhancement of humans is routine, we are taken through an opening lab scene that gives the technology its acme, 'Major', the cyborg played by Scarlett Johansson, a human brain implanted in an entirely robot body. And as sinister Hanka Robots boss Cutter (Peter Ferdinando) makes clear to Major's principal creatrix, Dr Oelet (Juliette Binoche), she is a weapon, no more. An investment that is expected to provide a return and victory in a war being fought in boardrooms, Yakuza bars and the bitter night streets of the Lawless Zone.'Cyber-terrorists' are waging war on Hanka Robots. In a stunning early action scene that sets a high standard, hacked geisha-bots go rogue during a meeting between Hanka representatives and the visiting diplomats of an African nation, murdering the ambassador (Chris Obi). Major and her squad of 'Section 9' special forces intervene.Major 'deep dives' into the central processing unit of one of the geisha-bots in an attempt to discover the hacker who turned it. She nearly comes to grief in the nightmarish, Jungian underworld of the AI's subconscious, a dark hell of shifting imagery and viral programs, but comes out with the necessary intel.The pursuit is on. Major and the rest of Section 9, a kind of heavily-armed, cyber-savvy SWAT team who seem to communicate telepathically, go after the hacker-terrorists she has identified and located. And so the story proceeds. The pace is relentless, the action explosive. I won't go into more detail for fear of spoilers. But as Major closes in on her quarry, she starts to question her origins and her identity. She sees visions of a girl being dragged from a burning hut by black-clad police. Her hazy, incomplete memory tells her she was a victim of terrorism before her transformation into a cyborg, her parents killed, but is it true? In sci-fi terms we are on familiar ground, charted by Philip K Dick: if androids dream of electric sheep, do cyborgs dream of a humanity they have lost? Major finds herself in the philosophical grey area between her perceived reality and what might be a computer-implanted false memory designed to create and motivate a corporate killing machine. Does she -- her soul, her eponymous 'ghost' -- remain truly human, or human-cyborg, or something new and different that represents an evolutionary advance? Director Rupert Sanders does not shy away from these deep questions while continuing to serve up a dramatic, visually electrifying and attention-holding story. The special effects are entirely convincing. The music (from Lorne Balfe and Clint Mansell) drives like a train.Johannson's performance holds centre stage by necessity and definition. This is not a glamorous role. She plays a hard and determined robot killer. Even the flesh-coloured, skin-tight latex body suit she wears for several scenes (squint and you can pretend she's naked) belongs in context, more functional than sexual. But she brings to the role a subtle, wondering vulnerability beneath the steely professionalism of the assassin, an emerging humanity that blossoms by the film's resolution. There were objections to a Caucasian playing a 'Japanese' character, but they don't make sense to me. Major is anethnic, a cyborg, her robot body manufactured in a lab. How could she be any race? Now I will be off to investigate the original version of Ghost in the Shell. I will try not to judge the original by the standards of the remake. I am glad to have been able to judge the remake on its own merits, and they are considerable. I recommend you see this film.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Ghost in the Shell is Blade Runner for a new generation. Scarlett Johansson gave a good performance as The Major and Michael Pitt, Juliette, Binoche, Takeshi Kitano and Pilou Asbaek all gave good supporting performances. Scarlett Johansson was well cast as The Major. The film had a good story. It reminded me of Blade Runner, The Matrix and Aeon Flux. It was like all 3 movies were rolled into one. The action sequences were not awesome and the film was slow. I believe it was more story, than action. The film deserves an Oscar nomination for it's visual effects. Weta Workshop did an outstanding job and the visual effects and the computer animation were outstanding. The Major's bodysuit, the Thermosuit, I have never seen anything like that before and the sets were amazing. I believe Blade Runner was a major influence behind the film. The music was good and it gave the film a dark and depressing tone. Don't take my word for it. Don't listen to what the critics say. Go and see it and decide for yourselves.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

On the flip side I have seen almost every science fiction movie, franchise which matters up to this point, just to mention a few 2001, Alien, Blade Runner, Star Wars and the list goes on. I think I proved my point that I am Science Fiction fan. Now that we got that out of the way, I am going to point out my thoughts about this movie.First of all the visuals are amazing !!! The city design is something what you have never seen before, it kinda reminds you of Blade Runner, maybe even on par with Blade Runner in some cases. It just gives you that wow effect and you just keep on staring at the world and billboards. This alone is enough to go see it !!!The acting was believable and enjoyable. Scarlet and Michael Pitt had some mistakes, there were some scenes which felt kinda hollow but it didn't kill my vibe. A big shout out goes to Pilou Asbaek who just nailed it.Now the story was pretty straight forward but does the job 100%, basically its unraveling the plot until you find out what actually happened, with a lot of amazing action sequences which will keep you on the edge of your seat. From what I have read from other reviews, a lot of people say that the story is real crap compared to the original material. Maybe this is so, I have no comparison. What I can tell you instead that the story WAS good enough to keep me interested until the end, and left the theater smiling. This is actually a very big deal, I have seen thousands of movies and I am very hard to impress.SCORE: 9.50 / 10 !!!!PS: An amazing movie to a Science Fiction fan who did not seen the originals !!! Go see it !!!","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

I was expecting some very close but not quite good enough adaptation as most anime to real life movies are but this one was perfect. The visual effects, the acting, everything was divine. They even explained the story so beautifully that I think it became clearer and easier to understand. This is a story of the first fully adapted cybernetic body with a human mind in a world where everything is moving in the direction of robotic modification. We find ourselves following along with Major(Scarlett Johansson) as she first wakes up and the story there after.Without giving away any of the actual plot this is the kind of movie that really makes you drill down an question what makes a machine, a machine. And what makes someone truly human.10/10 I can't imagine someone doing this better, it really was that good. And this coming from a longtime anime and ghost in the shell fan.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A New Beginning that is Visually Impressive","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3686704/?ref_=tt_urv","infoalwaysacritic","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur50400002/?ref_=tt_urv","17 April 2017","For anyone who has been subjected to the painful adaptations of anime to the realm of live action films, the prospect of bringing the Ghost in the Shell world to life sounds too good to be true and daunting, to say the least. Visually, Anime films tend to stretch reality to create larger-than-life characters, with outfits and events that translate to a cosplay reality that is, if not jarring, completely impractical and somewhat corny. This is part of its charm, but not only is Anime known for its distinct look, but also for methods of story-telling that do not fit the North American paradigm. The Ghost in the Shell movie from 1995 competes with Akira as the most widely received mature anime of its time and a story that is still relevant today. This new film doesn't try to be the same thing and succeeds in some areas while being greatly misunderstood in others.Focusing on the Major's origin story, those familiar with the GITS stories will immediately spot some deliberate inconsistencies, this film also follows the criminal actions of a major corporation and Section 9's attempt to capture a terrorist hacker. The Major has at least 2 other origin stories in the animes, so this is likely a choice by the producers to bring GITS to a new audience and by the end of the film the two plot lines converge while the Major's identity is brought in line with the Anime.Visually this film communicates volumes without saying a word. Rupert Sanders has specifically engaged craftspeople in Weta Workshop to produce as much as possible with real props. This attention to detail shows in the cyberpunk realism, imbued and enhanced by CG effects that produce an environment reminiscent of Blade Runner, Robocop and other classic sci-fi films. If no other reason to watch this, the visual quality of this film makes it worth seeing.With such a diverse cast available from the GITS source material, the producers decided to focus on only a handful of characters. Batou supports the Major while having a relationship much like detective partners. He cares about her, expressing concern for her well-being. He runs to her aid when he thinks she's in trouble, all while having a soft spot for dogs. The Major, on the other hand, is detached from the world, curious about humanity and struggles with her sense of identity. What does it mean to be human? Scarlett Johansson herself remarked in an interview that finishing the film was a relief to get back to being herself. Don't expect any academy awards for the acting, even if it is perfectly in line with the source material, right down to the way that the major moved.While the script isn't terrible, it isn't helped at all by the hefty reveals at the beginning of the film. No attempt is made to create mystery around who the villain is. You'll know from the start who it is that needs to come to justice. Instead, the Major's origin is imbued with a small mystery and enough twists take place to provoke an emotional response when things are revealed.It is also worth mentioning that this film makes a wild departure from expectations by including virtually no nudity, sexual content or foul language. This makes the film much more accessible than the first film, which contains a great deal of nudity and brutal violence.If your only exposure to the Ghost in the Shell is the anime classic from 1995, this new film will feel very different. The hallmarks of the GITS world as portrayed in the Stand Alone Complex shows and other films made in its wake follow a distinct format, one that Rupert Sanders sticks to. This is not an Avenger film that exalts superpowers, teamwork and western principles; Section 9 is an elite and aggressive anti-crime unit that will punitively kill anyone who engages them. They are in a word: vindictive. That is, to some, their appeal and in many ways this film delivers. At the same time, don't expect earth shattering or culture forming concepts to be discussed. There are some fundamental questions of identity and bare-bones philosophy but this film chooses instead to focus on the aesthetic of GITS and the development of the Major as a person. If they choose to do so, viewers who enjoy the new movie and wish to explore the original movie will be in for a surprise, and will likely be better served to explore the Stand Alone Complex or Arise series instead. Those who enjoyed the original film wil likely be disappointed if they did not also like the Stand Alone Complex.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

I was prepared for a flop but not for enjoy the movie, which it was a very pleasant feeling.First of all I am not a guy of comics or Mangas, my thing is about movies, so my point of view is only between this adaptation and the Japanese anime movie, which I love and it is the main source they used for the film.The film takes about 70% from the original anime movie and the other 30% is an upgrade over the original source. An upgrade?..yes an upgrade. As I said before, I love the Anime version but it is a little heavy to watch for most viewers because it gets messy and boring, that's what this new version is not, it is more common viewer friendly and less philosophical type of fan.Yes, the movie keeps the questioning about humanity and soul (or Ghost), and all those things that makes Ghost in the Shell, well... Ghost in the Shell, but also takes us for a much more fun ride, easy to understand and easy to enjoy, than the original movie did.Hardcore Fans would say the movie is too much light or even empty but I think that it is a great adaptation, they took a great animated movie and make it into a great live action movie.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Ignore the nonsense regarding comments about Scarlett Johansson ""whitewashing"" the movie. I do not know what the big deal is. She is awesome in it and the Japanese loved her playing the part. Honestly, I cannot think of a single Japanese actress who could have played that part well and looks like the original manga character anyway.

It's kind of ridiculous. The Major in the Anime never really looked like an Asian woman. And both the movie and the anime the ghost(brain or soul, however you wanna see it) was put into an mechanic body. In the anime of 1995, the major could choose any body she want. So far to the controversy.Ghost in the Shell (2017) is the most solid Anime Live Action movie made by Hollywood so far. The visual is stunning, especially if you watch it as IMAX 3D. It feels like the movie was made for 3D viewing. You feel like that you are in this futuristic cyberpunk world. And you see the world, the people through The Majors eyes. The acting is pretty good. Scarlett Johansson is a very talent actress, so is Pilou Asbæk who played Batou. The dynamic between the two actors makes you feel like, if Batou and the Major have been working a whole life together. Johansson acted exactly like how her character ""Major"" should have behaved in all situations. There is no overacting. It doesn't feel like forced.The Plot isn't completely new, but it still fits in the universe of Ghost in the Shell. And i like the fact that the movie is no 100% copy and paste from the anime. Usually people always want an adaptation be a 100% copy of a book or anime or whatever source they use. But for me a movie is still kind of an art, an expression about how we (or the director) interpret the source material. There is not only one way to do it. The actors, Rupert Sanders, Clint Mansel and the rest of the team did a great job to adapt a very complicated source material. That's why i think Ghost in the Shell (2017) deserves a lot more than 6.9.And as always a review is just a subjective view of a person! :D","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

And if you get to see it in an IMAX theater? Count yourself lucky.This movie should have been advertised as a cyberpunk, Bladerunner like experience, highlighting visuals, sound, music and effects. Instead they tried to sell it as a Scarlet action movie. A huge mistake.I can't think of a release in the last several years that opens itself up to so much potential negative critique. Casting? Check. Remake of classic that can never please some fans? Check. Obviously more, but that would get boring in a hurry... point is people can come at this movie from a lot of different angles, often with a lot of expectation built in.But for the few who can put expectation aside, or to whom the story and characters are brand new? This is a rock solid piece of entertainment bringing Asian cyberpunk to American audiences. It is full of incredible ideas including cybernetic enhancement, ghost hacking and more than one question aimed at reality itself.The visuals! Just spectacular! and it is worth watching the credits just to see all the houses, teams and names of people who worked on this movie. While GitS does feel sectional, with each scene being a different project - the visual style itself is very consistent and at times truly magical. I am very critical of CG effects, their overuse, and the muddy visual style that often is the result of a complete screen makeover.Not here. Like Dr. Strange the effects are clean, unique with proper lighting and contrast. The cityscape shots with crazy enormous animated holograms are especially nice. The visual details are everywhere - the way people look, their mods - constantly asking visual questions and providing something fascinating to look at. The effects are Brilliant. The sound and soundtrack? Perfect compliment to the visuals.I also think casting is amazing, including Scarlet. The casting is so good that we really don't get enough time with any of the characters except Major, and really, she's not a very interesting protagonist. This comes through in Scarlet's mostly wooden performance, which could be argued fits, but that does little to improve what is actually there.Story wise (and i hinted i wouldn't go here), I have to ask, ""if this was a carbon copy remake of the original anime, just live action, would it be a better movie?"" The answer is yes, it would be better. All the lifts from the anime worked beautifully, all the changes? Not improvements. The biggest change involving Major's origin story which is left beautifully vague in the anime, which I feel works much better regarding the overall chaos of the world in which they live. The dialog at times is very explanatory instead of simply serving story. The original anime is a challenging movie that needs to watch 2 or 3 times to catch the details. The same can not be said regarding the story of this version, which by comparison spoon feeds the information. But... imo the original GitS is a 10/10 masterpiece. Expecting another film on this level is a lot to ask for, and while not as good, this remake does justice to the franchise. Why?The visuals! My goodness! I actually want to pay for another 3D IMAX showing to soak it in again. So impressive, and it is really nice to see effect work that pushes way beyond the ordinary.Ghost in the Shell is exactly the type of movie that gets crushed at the box office, but finds a cult following later in its life. In this case, in the form of VR headsets that will present the 3D and effects when home versions are released. balanced toward sound, visuals and effects - but with such excellence... 8 out of 10!","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

But I do know that Masamune Shirow, the creator of that source material agreed with the changes made to his creation. Seeing the movie I think I know why he agreed to having Scarlett Johansson portraying his heroine. Namely: The issues raised in his movie are not Japanese but rather universal. The fact she doesn't look Japanese enhances the alienation of her character (and all the other non Japanese being part of the global corporation that doesn't really care about being Japanese). And there's at least one Japanese character, who insists on speaking nothing but Japanese all through the movie. Think about the significance of his role and you'll realize that the the Japanese soul of the film is still shining bright. On top of all that, Scarlett is superb. You can see how she's more than an action figure, you can see, her humane ghost coming through. It makes sense that her mother would recognize her in a completely new, made up, body. In fact, the fact she's not Japanese makes this point much stronger.All other aspects of this film are of the highest quality. CGI and artistic design are simply visionary. I would summarize it as Blade Runner on steroids. I have a feeling that's where Ridley Scott would've taken his classic masterpiece if he only could at the time. The actors don't all get to demonstrate their abilities, but besides Scarlett Johansson, one must also mention the great performance of Juliette Binoche, and Peter Ferdinando, as the perfect villain.The whole point of this movie, is the question: what being human is all about, and how destructible is humanity. Now how deep is the answer offered by the movie, is in this case up to each and every spectator, simply because we're not being spoon fed with the required conclusions.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

To me, this film was fantastic. I went in expecting to be disappointed and I came out grinning ear to ear. I laughed as I watched Aramaki be a down right bad ass. the film took some time to present the world itself without jumping to action. Side characters were great, I enjoyed Aramaki and Batou the most, Togusa, Saito and Ishikawa didn't have much screen time, but still delivered. A good movie.In the future, the clear majority of humans are augmented with cybernetics, enhancing various traits like vision, strength, and intelligence. Hanka Robotics, the world's leading developer of augmentative technology, establishes a secret project to develop a mechanical body, or ""shell"", that can integrate a human brain. a young woman who is the sole survivor of the cyberterrorist attack which killed her parents, is chosen as the test subject after her body is apparently damaged beyond repair. Over the objections of her designer, Dr. Ouelet, Hanka CEO Cutter decides to use Killian as a counter-terrorism operative.A year later, Killian has attained the rank of Major in the anti-terrorist bureau Section 9, working alongside operatives Batou and Togusa under Chief Daisuke Aramaki. The team successfully thwarts a terrorist attack on a Hanka business conference, and Killian destroys a rogue mechanical geisha after it murders a hostage. After learning that the geisha was hacked by an unknown entity, known only as Kuze, Killian breaks protocol and ""dives"" into its AI for answers. The entity attempts a counter-hack, and Batou is forced to disconnect her. Using the information, she was able to gather, the two trace the hacker to a Yakuza nightclub, where they are lured into a trap. The resulting explosion destroys Batou's eyes, and leaves Killian's body severely damaged.Kuze tracks down Section 9's Hanka consultant, Dr. Dahlin, and kills her. The team links her murder to the deaths of other senior company researchers, and realize that Dr. Ouelet is the next target. Kuze takes control of two sanitation workers and sends them to kill Ouelet, but it is unsuccessful. Togusa traces the hack to a secret location, where the team discovers many humans mentally linked together as a makeshift signal network. Killian is captured, and Kuze reveals that he is a failed Hanka test subject from the same project that created Killian, otherwise known as 2571. He urges her to question her own memories before freeing her and escaping.Killian confronts Ouelet, who admits there were 98 test subjects before Killian but she was the only one to survive the process and that her memories are fake implanted ones. Cutter has decided that Killian is too much of a liability, and orders Ouelet to euthanize her after she returns to Hanka Robotics. Instead, Ouelet gives Killian an address and helps her escape. Cutter kills Ouelet, but blames Killian, saying that she has gone rogue. He subsequently informs Aramaki and the team that Killian must be terminated by any means necessary.Killian follows the address to an apartment occupied by a widowed mother, who reveals that her daughter, Motoko Kusanagi, ran away from home a year ago and was arrested, before taking her own life while in custody. Unable to process her emotions, Killian leaves and contacts Aramaki, who intentionally allows Cutter to eavesdrop on their conversation. Batou, Togusa, and Aramaki each subdue Cutter's men trying to ambush them, while Killian follows her memories to the hideaway where Motoko was last seen. There, she and Kuze meet, and recall their past lives as anti-augmentation radicals who were abducted by Hanka for use as test subjects. Cutter deploys a ""spider-tank"" to kill them, and Kuze nearly dies before Killian is able to tear off the tank's motor, losing her left arm in the process. Mortally wounded, Kuze offers to merge his ""ghost"" with Killian's before a Hanka sniper kills him. Batou and the team rescue Killian, while Aramaki executes Cutter with Killian's consent. The next day, Killian, now repaired and embracing her identity as Motoko, reconnects with her mother before returning to work with Section 9.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

But I believe a movie should fundamentally be judged by its own merits and limits, and not by comparing it with the original, be it a novel, cartoon, or another movie. This movie is not nearly as bad as some of the haters say. It has good characters, fine acting, nice (albeit a bit stereotypical) story, wonderful visuals, hypnotic music, and a haunting theme. If you have not seen this movie, please do not be discouraged by negative reviews, and give it a chance.

Does style trump substance? Has the message been altered to affect the messenger? From the manga series to anime form and now a live action avatar in Rupert Sanders technically impressive but emotionally distant version, Ghost in the Machine has taken many forms. Yet none is as striking as Scarlett Johansson in the title role as The Major, a babe-o-licious killing machine. Major has become a cyber-enhanced android weapon living in a neon-lit world of giant holograms that become landmarks that engorge its urban futuristic city. In this Blade Runner inspired sci-fi universe, the world is one violent melee. Caught in the crossfire is Mira Killian, a helpless victim before reincarnated as a female Robo-cop whose sole purpose is to fight terrorism. An effective cyborg Amazon, Mira aka The Major starts to feel unexpected emotions that gets in the way of her combat missions. An android becoming human can be a lethal disruption, one that needs to be stopped before going rogue. She has a ghost (soul) somewhere in her shell.The plot is familiar and highly predictable. But Ms. Johansson is perfectly cast. The actress has had much practice playing this prototype before in her mad array of superhero warriors (from Lucy and Black Widow in the Avengers series), a sub-human creature (Under the Skin), and computer types (the voice in Her). Here, she becomes the perfect natural unnatural model of beauty, the embodiment of the ideal woman. All electronic circuitry in place and all the right curves as well, a quintessential sex doll for those viewers trapped in a state of arrested development (which is the film's target audience). There is ample supporting in the film's international casting which includes the luminous Juliette Binoche as Mira's creator, Micheal Pitt, Peter Ferdinado, ""Beat' Takeshi Kitano, and Pilou Asbaek as Major's loyal sidekick. All bring to their roles enough swagger and authority that fills in the blanks to their stock characters. Screenwriters Jamie Moss William Wheeler, and Ehren Kruger try to bring some pathos to their main character, but the non-stop violence upstages any subtlety. ( I wish there were more quieter moments to help establish the anguish of the main character.) The physical encounters seem to be more of interest, with little time spent on her poignant dilemma. This literally sacrifices Major's major character development. She remains an enigma, a ghost in a shell, although that is not the film's intent. One is suppose to feel some empathy for our hero, that is, between the cracking of bones and bloody carnage.There is plenty of that, and I mean plenty of chases and fight moves, but there is also some stunning eye candy to savor in beautifully staged scene after scene. Even if there is not real emotional connection, the overall effect of Sanders' images is breathtaking. Credit Jess Hall's cinematography, quite remarkable in its splendor. The production design by Jan Roelfs covers any of the film's narrative deficits in its detailed coolness. The music score by Lorne Balfe and Clint Mansell adds the right techno- pop atmosphere and the taut editing by Billy Rich and Neil Smith is thrilling. Director Sanders has a dark hypnotic vision and blends the action and CGI seamlessly. Large holographic geisha, giant floating koi, bodies that dissolve into thin air, ethereal disembodied figures, are just a few the the arresting images, giving the perfect sense of eeriness that more than suggests a world off balance. He gives us enough of the old ""razzle-dazzle"" that one could overdose on the film's stunning hallucinations But the reality is that the film is all clever visual trickery used to deflect the hollowness of his film genre itself. Action. after all, is the main event.Ghost in the Shell is definitely an intriguing shell game. It's an interesting sleight of hand when viewing, even if it is ultimately empty inside. But the journey, especially for moviegoers who like their action with imaginative state-of-the-arts edginess, couldn't be more pleasing or satisfied. (This film may be destined to become a cult film.)","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

It might not be as complex and nail biting as some might expect, but I thought overall, the story was intriguing and the action/effects were great as well. My wife, who cannot stand Anime in the slightest, sat through the entire move with me and agreed afterward that it was really good.Best of all, this could absolutely have a sequel, or even turn into a trilogy, (please let this be a trilogy) as this installment is mainly about the Major discovering who she is, how she came to be, and what part she plays in the larger picture of the world. At the end of it, I felt like it would be a shame to end the story where it left off. (Sequel could start right at the laughing man story)Go into this just expecting a fun time, and you'll be satisfied.

Stunningly beautiful and sheer joy for your eyes, Casting was absolutely spot on too can't fault that in any way whatsoever.But It just feels very short to me. More character development would have been nice especially for those new to ghost in the shell.It really could have been longer 30 minutes or so. And it truly does deserve a follow up or 2!The gits universe has lots of story potential. Even as a series with same cast and direction.Section 9 members all have potential to carry longer roles and dialogue..this is a huge missed opportunity.This also has plenty replay value too, I easily watch this 2 or 3 times a year and still find myself fully engaged. Some of the scenes are simply breathtaking. In fact every scene is glorious.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

On October 16, it was announced that DreamWorks had made a $10 million offer to Scarlett Johansson for the lead role after Robbie's talks for the role fell apart when she was cast as Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad. in my opinion she would suit for her i would say for Margot more in suicide squad then this if she toke role for this movie i would have said it wont suit her at all, scarlett was more better for her own role for this movie as major the action was SO great specially scene at building was great and club scene and all rest of action is so enjoyable and watchable film 1h 47min running time its perfect in my opinion this film didn't do any justice, this film has made it just like original 95 film just like but with different story line The atmosphere, effects, music and aesthetics are stunningly beautiful! You can still feel the heart and soul of Ghost in the Shell. The story is there - slightly changed but still thought provoking. There are many scenes where you can really see the amount of work that was put into making this movie - tiny details in the background noting like 95 film, the aura of Hong Kong and other locations where this film was shot and just the overall look and feel.and different way of film plot the way it follows, there wasn't much punching holes in film there wasn't much of confusing scenes makes you wanna ask questions, you need to watch this movie i don't want to spoil it When it comes to getting high IMDb ratings this movie was already destined to fail just because it is an anime adaptation of a highly beloved nineties classic. rotten tomatoes got %46 witch is still good not like batman vs superman got 26 that is still bit high but this is much higher film then that. This is NOT the original film, this is its own film that you need to appreciate as it stands (I know that is difficult, believe me). If you haven't already seen it, please take my word for it and go in with no expectations, go in cold (like it is a new experience). go and see it if not go and see it, i understand for fans its not what they dreamed off but hey i am not saying its for everyone but give it a go its movie its not a big deal.the cast as i said scarlett suits for this role she was perfect she was great character i loved her in this movie a lot more then Lucy but hey its my opinion what to like her character, character of Lucy is bit different to this film. everyone and me i said maybe Ron perlman could play Batou i thought he be in it but it ended up Scarlett had played role with (pilou asbæk) in Lucy he was just in opening scene of Lucy (2014) strange. he was very good as Batou good but i rather have Ron perlman being Batou better suits for him a lot more for his role. plot In the near future, Major is the first of her kind: A human saved from a terrible crash, who is cyber-enhanced to be a perfect soldier (Scarlett Johansson) devoted to stopping the world's most dangerous criminals. and Batou kicked a lot ass sametime with Major a lot great action never lost faith with original film made a lot different but in live action film never wanted ruin any plot you need to see it Seeing a 6.9 as the current user score (as of 30 March) is unfortunate, because this film captures EVERYTHING that Ghost in the Shell was and thanks to this film IS CURRENTLY. As a film it stands strong in the Sci-Fi genre and does manage to still be thought-provoking. Please take your time before giving it a low rating or hating this film, movie goes on its own. if fans and everyone understand little bit better before you hate this flick, this flick is awesome 10.10 great flick go see it, its worth it","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

First let me go trough the parts really quick (TL/DR below):Visually: 9/10 - The creators really blew me away with a lot of the CG and special effects love put into the film. The scenes that were borrowed and recreated from the original gave me goose bumps.Overall Acting & cast: 8/10 - The makers did a great job of selecting the characters and especially Batou was 100/100. Even his love for dogs and long hounds (sorry bad at dog types).ScarJoe as Major: 9/10 - Really can't see the criticism here. She does a great job and also really looks like the Major.Directing and Cinematography: 7/10 - While some scenes referencing the original anime were great, I thought it lost some of the 'weird' 'uncomfortable' but very ascetic shots the anime had in favor of more 'action'-type shots. Script (THE BIG ONE): 6/10 0 A lot of people are really stuck on the part that this movie is a simplified version of the original, in terms of the psychological and ethical dilemma's that made us think after we saw the original. And I agree. I was 14 when I watched the original and it blew my mind. And so we're a lot of other 14 year old minds in the day. We watched it over and over and became otaku's after. I think that's what people are expecting again. If you think about the idea of the original script, it was a new story and vision about what makes us human vs what makes us a machine. This topic was very new and untapped at that time. Since the original GITS hundreds of films were made out of the inspiration this film has caused - pretty much every sci-fi film out there about man vs machine.After watching this film I felt some nostalgia, but it didn't make me think about the future and the man vs machine relationship the way the original did. And it's because it clearly wasn't the choice of the makers. They wanted to tap into the nostalgia and make it a homage for a wider audience.But if they started in a different spot... If they would have started with the original idea ""let's make a new story about what makes us human vs what makes us a machine"" they could have build upon the GITS vision and the ideas of other sci-fi movies to makes something truly new and mind-blowing. A recent example was the film ""Machinima"". It plays with the same tension, but is a truly mind- blowing film. Just like the Black Mirror series.It was great seeing the Major again, at the same time I would have appreciated a totally new take on the theme. One that takes us another 20 years forward. And a movie I would re-watch 10 times, like the original GITS.TL/DR As a homage this is the best anime film so far, but they didn't nail what made the film great in the first place: a new vision for the idea and philosophy of ""what makes us human vs what makes us machine""","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

First off, the visuals are beautiful as many have noted, however what's really important are the characters themselves.There is depth, and honestly you are wanting this to be bad if you ignore the character development. The weakest part of the movie is the somewhat generic plot, however its important to realize that the plot itself is not necessarily out of character for the GITS universe as GITS was the inspiration for many plots of this type. Additionally, character development was solid for the main cast (except for the generic villain, although the 1995 version didn't really have a strong villain either.) The Major does have existential questioning and real personality along with the other significant characters.Its worth seeing whether you are a fan or not. If you are a fan than I'd say that there is plenty for you in the live-action version as long as you accept that it wasn't solely based on the 1995 version and that it needs to make changes for a wider audience.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I saw the movie yesterday and i was impressed at how they actually managed to translate the anime into ""real life"" stuff, this is no small achievement.People are overlooking the great qualities of this movie for the sake of criticism and ideology. As an anime and manga fan, i have to say that i recognize what we are supposed to get if we expect it to come from Hollywood: we get what we got for ghost in the shell 2017.Did the story lose depth? Its actually a questionable complaint... i have watched many anime and ghost in the shell always stood out as one of those who belonged to a niche. If anything, i feel that if there is anything that will impact this movie's performance, its exactly this: its directed to a specific public. And this actually should account as a sign that they actually hold loyalty to the source material when they wrote the script, because they could have made this a movie that appealed to other fan bases, depending on the direction it took.I have mixed feelings about this choice, i want the movie to perform well, because i want more anime/manga movies... but to perform well, sometimes you need to make more marketing, you have to destroy it a little. I expect people to blame the wrong things here, when the only thing to blame is the story itself.Ghost in the shell was new when it was new, now that everybody copied and created other stories inspired on it, critics will call it ""unoriginal""... how unfair.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

There were expectations. For me, these expectations were high. The original 1995 Ghost in the Shell anime had layer upon layer of subliminal meaning in its vast imagery and storytelling. Its themes were explored deeply, and gained a cult following momentously. Rupert Sanders has delivered a visually outstanding instalment to the franchise. Although a soft reboot/reimagining of the original, GITS stands on its own.Even if some of the Ghost (or Soul) from the anime is lost, the Shell is incredibly vibrant. The cinematography is stunning, jam-packed with a colourful visual design and intricate sets, recreating the familiar feeling of the original material. Something that worried me going into this film was that it would avoid Major's drive to discover who/what she is, and turn it into an action-packed thrill ride with no meaning. However, to my delight, this did not happen. In fact, the story drifts from the original and twists our expectations. It's smart, cool and refreshingly enjoyable.Scarlett Johansson was cast with heated discussion amongst fans, but I believe she has done a wonderful job with this role. She clicks with this world perfectly, in my eyes. Pilou Asbæk as Batou is well-cast, also. Both work together nicely with great chemistry. Binoche, Kitano, Ferdinando and everyone else involved are so very natural in the setting. Some of the set pieces look and perform great, though surprisingly cut-down to ensure the story stays focused on Major.Clint Mansell & Lorne Balfe utilise snippets from Kenji Kawai's original theme as a respectful nod, then progress forward with a synth-heavy score that weaves so beautifully with the picture. Subtle but important. It's an impressive ambiance that fills the atmosphere presented in the film.Ghost in the Shell is not for everyone, but like the original, I do think everyone should try it. It's not going to rake in a huge amount of money in its theatrical run, but don't take that as a bad sign. The only thing I'd like to see is an uncut version; it feels like it was toned down for a wider audience. That said, I'm absolutely interested in seeing a sequel or two to further expand upon the story of Major & Batou. Verdict; Impressive visual effects, smart storytelling and interesting characters make Ghost in the Shell an energetic and entertaining experience.Ghost in the Shell, 8/10.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

However, I was thoroughly surprised and impressed with how well done this movie actually was. They focus more on the action aspect in this remake which has disappointed some, but it's honestly quite understandable why this approach was taken. You have to think that they were trying to bring in audiences as well as devoted fans and while the long-time fans of the series may prefer the more existential psychological approach that GitS is known for, most people would probably not be as interested as a more action packed flick. I think they did the best they could with what they had and while it's still focused more on action, they managed to throw in some of the basic underlying themes of GitS and did a decent job of it too. I'm not going to discuss the whole white washing issue, but I personally think Scarlet Johansson did a rather good job of capturing Major for the most part. Most the time she reacted as major would and nothing she did really felt out of character. Altogether, I left the theater satisfied and would recommend it to fans and non-fans alike. I think it really doesn't deserve all the crap that people (mostly fans) have been giving it. A bad remake is The Last Airbender and this certainly isn't even close to that monstrosity.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

It stars Scarlett Johansson as a cyborg counter- terrorist commander, taking on hackers, cyber terrorists and other criminals (in a futuristic world). The movie also costars Pilou Asbaek (who also costarred with Johansson in the sci-fi action hit 'LUCY'), Michael Pitt, Takeshi Kitano, Juliette Binoche and Chin Han. It was directed by Rupert Sanders (who also helmed 2012's 'SNOW WHITE AND THE HUNTSMAN'), and it was written by Jamie Moss, William Wheeler and Ehren Kruger. The film has received mixed reviews from critics and fans, and it's also underperformed at the Box Office so far. It's also been heavily criticized for it's casting of Johansson as well, in an originally Asian role. I absolutely loved the film's visuals, but I definitely can't say I found the story that interesting or involving.The Major (Johansson) is the cyborg head of a counter-cyber terrorist task force, known as Section 9. Her team catches and kills cyber criminals, and terrorists, in a future world that's becoming more and more machine. The Major is the ghost of a human, with a forgotten past, that functions in an almost entirely machine body. As she tries to defeat an unknown new threat, she also struggles to identify with who she really is.The film is absolutely stunning to watch, but I could not find myself interested, or involved, in any of the characters or story, in the slightest, until the third act (but even then it was just a very slight interest). It seems like such a waste too, because the action, music and overall style of the movie is absolutely breathtaking to experience. In many ways it reminds me of classic sci-fi from yesteryear, but only on a purely visual level. It's practically the ultimate example of style over substance, and I'm sure the casting of an Asian actress, in the lead, would have benefited the film immensely as well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/216048414","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

It does not try to please, it does not try to excite, it does not try to be popular blaring it's name out for profit.Instead this is a faithful transposition, the concept, the emotion, from the source to the screen. Don't expect it to be loud, bright, full of explosions like Marvel is.Please make more of these!The world needs pure art now more than ever.The ability to translate creative purity, without bias or proclivity, from one medium to another is holy to say the least.Masamune Shirow, the original writer, had an idea, a story, which he wrote it into manga. That idea, that feeling, has been written into film here. Captured in the medium of film with amazing accuracy and cinematography.The film, is not important.The Terabytes of RAW video data captured on cinematographic storage, is not important.What is important is that we, a species that has the ability to create art, keeps on creating it.Rarely seen these days is a work that is just for the purpose of its own realization.Ghost in the Shell (2017) is one such rare work.A story, a feeling, a moving work of art true to its source. To it's core.I watched it in-cinema upon release, in a modern digital theater. I cried in the movie theater for the first time in my life.Keep on keeping on, humans, your time has only just begun.8/10 Solid watch if you are a fan of the original. Scarlett does a good job. Michael Pitt does a magnificent job.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I love the colors and atmosphere and the CGI is very nicely done. If nothing else, it is visually incredible and very pleasant to look at (more so for the first 2/3 of the movie).The story is fine, nothing too crazy, but I did like the science fiction elements. Honestly I think they did a good job of keeping it simple enough to easily follow and not get confused. I really appreciate that it's not too long. The pacing is good, and the movie doesn't overstay it's welcome.If you like sci-fi or the cyberpunk vibe I'd recommend you give this one a try!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The characters are quite well respected and the casting of Scarlett Johanson is not so bad. Although she doesn't match the charisma and sex appeal of Motoko from the anime, her attitude and style match the style of the Major.The original story is complex and interesting and corresponds to a mixture of important elements found among the different anime.It's pretty cool to see scenes almost identical to the first anime and I must say that the overall production is well done.Overall, I believe that a fan of the anime will be very satisfied with this live action and especially with being able to see another story version of the most badass-sexy-cyborg I know.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

And, while the story is somewhat predictable, it's packaged so well!Scarlett Johansson plays a young woman whose brain has been placed in a mechanical body, or ""shell"", and is having a bit of an existential crisis while serving in an anti-terrorism quasi military unit. Taheshi Kitano, Pilou Asbaek and Juliette Binoche are excellent as her boss, partner and doctor, while Michael Pitt shines as, uh, well, that would be giving it away.The film continues to face some controversy because – while it was based on a Japanese manga, financed by Chinese companies and essentially set in Hong Kong – it featured Western actors in three of the key lead roles.This movie may be a bit of an acquired taste, but if you like Blade Runner, see it now.

Her pose, her (missing) facial impressions and her regular speaking voice is well done, judging from the background and the character.To the person who has seen the original, there are some elements that are more fleshed out than in the original, probably for the western cinema viewer who would probably have difficulties reading between the line of the original Japanese predecessor. Most of the scenes are however very close to the original with a lot of love for detail.The visuals are stunning and it feels very retro-90s futuristic.

The plot is a simple one, the Major comes to doubt her origin story, that a company called Hanka saved her from death but had to put her brain into an outwardly soft, but quite capable robotic body, in order to do it.If you've ever dipped into manga, you will recognize the feel of this movie. That it manages to duplicate and improve on a 1990's era comic is no small achievement. It's quite clever about it. So is Scarlett Johansson. It's surprising how effective she is, even after Lucy and the Avenger's movies. It's good to spend some time with her as she brings the story to life.The idea that it would have been better with a Japanese in the lead role is hard to see. The story would have seemed a bit less relevant without Scarlett and that seems unnecessary.

Whether it be suggestions that the film was white-washed, accusations of the heady and lofty themes of the original being watered down or general dismissal of the film as simple eye-candy and nothing more... the movie's gotten it's fair share of flack. It's one of those movies that just can't seem to catch a break. And yet, I went in with an open mind and found myself very much enjoying the film. Yes, it's certainly no masterpiece and it's safe to say that the original did it better, but I think it's also fair to say that the film doesn't deserve even a fraction of the hate it's received and it's a great bit of fun. The franchise has existed in one form or another for nearly thirty years now... and with various adaptations already existing, I see no reason to bemoan another take on the material that will introduce newer audiences to the series and hopefully inspire them to go back and check out its origins. It's a perfectly valid retelling of a classic story, and I for one hope that as time goes on, more people will learn to appreciate it.We follow Major Mira Killian (Scarlett Johansson), a woman in the not-too-distant future whose mind and ""ghost"" (a sort-of catch all description of one's being and consciousness) have been placed into a synthetic cybernetic body after her original form was allegedly damaged beyond medical repair. Now working as an anti-terrorist operative for an organization known as Section 9, Major Killian works together with others to thwart various attacks and protect the public and Section 9's benefactors. However, after an assassination droid murders a doctor working for Hanka Robotics (the same company responsible for the construction of Killian's synthetic body), Killian and her partners are drawn into a deeper and more troubling conflict than they could have imagined... one that will make them question their allegiances and wonder just who is on their side...The strengths of the film lay in its excellent casting and top-notch visual direction, which both contribute to crafting and maintaining a constant sense of entertainment and intrigue, despite a somewhat stock script. Casting controversies aside, every role is well-cast and extremely well-played, and every player fits their part near- perfectly. Scarlett Johansson makes for a very compelling and troubled protagonist, and she does quite a bit with the role. Supporting roles played by the likes of Michael Pitt, Takeshi Kitano and Juliette Binoche are quite good and make for a great ensemble. And special praise goes to Pilou Asbæk in his excellent role as ""Batou"", Major's closest friend and human connection. He's just fantastic in the part.Sanders' guidance in the film is just extraordinary, and I'll be keeping an eye out for him, because the man clearly knows how to tell one heck of a visual story. His sense of framing, movement and composition is slick and stylish and he works together perfectly with cinematographer Jess Hall in crafting some simply gorgeous imagery. He's one of those directors who understands how to competently construct a sequence without relying too much on gimmicks and lazy conventions... You won't see a bland and poorly-framed shaky-came fight sequence or laughably complex CGI nightmare of a shot here. He's intent to glide the camera smoothly around the scene in a very subtle way and let us take in the sights. Which is quite refreshing. And by god... the action is just awe-inspiring. It's exciting. It's stylish and wild. And yet it never goes too far. Sure, there's a lot of digital effects... but they're used appropriately and never feel contrived or overtly fake.Where the film loses some points however, is in the script by Jamie Moss, William Wheeler and Ehren Kruger. Not that it's necessarily bad by any means. It's a solid enough storyline. But it's a bit too stock. A bit too basic. And yes... it's missing a lot of the depth and themes of the original works that inspired it. What we have here is a sort- of tribute to the source material that doesn't feel quite confident enough in itself to sneak in the subtext of what came before. And as a result... it becomes predictable and unfortunately relies on more basic tropes and clichés. There's the shell of a great script here... (I had to make one ""shell"" joke) but the substance is only partially present.Still, I can't say that the script dragged the film down too much. Sanders and his writing team seem intent on taking what came before and turning it into a beautiful action extravaganza... and I think they succeeded. Yes, the 1995 film was a better adaptation. But that doesn't change the fact that the 2017 film is a great bit of entertainment and is very much enjoyable in its own way. This is a faster, crazier and somewhat more blunt ""Ghost in the Shell."" But I think it's still most certainly a decent take on the material Masamune Shirow created so many years ago.Strictly taking the film on its own, I gotta give it an 8 out of 10. It's a blast to behold on the big-screen, and I think fans are doing themselves a great disservice by so quickly dismissing it. Sure, what came before might have objectively been better. But this one is still pretty darned good.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Also, I had not watched the original movie before. But, I was pleasantly surprised to enjoy the movie. Visually the movie is stunning. The shots are often done very nicely I thought, and it showcases the awesome scenes and visuals without overdoing it. Moreover, the environments and the world were described really nice throughout the movie. I thought the story told was interesting. Interesting enough to have me thinking ahead of what is going on and why. There was some nice drama elements that I appreciated and they felt authentic. I thought the action scenes were good. There were some cringy, cheesy scenes scattered throughout the movie, but I did not mind overall (maybe that was due to my low expectations). Overall, the movie will be most memorable for me for the visuals.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

"8","/10","An enjoyable watch for fans of Sci-Fi with great visuals but held back by mediocre dialogue","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3679697/?ref_=tt_urv","disciple_of_sauron","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur8531257/?ref_=tt_urv","7 April 2017","Hey there. This is the first review I've written for IMDb though I've been using the site daily for more than a decade now.I've watched Ghost in the Shell at the cinema 3 days ago, knowing beforehand about the controversies that have surrounded this movie for the last 6 months or so. Science fiction movies are probably my favorite genre and I also enjoyed most of Scarlett's movies for the past 8-9 years so those two factors were a plus for me going in. Regarding the whitewashing business, I think its been blown way, WAY out of proportion by social justice warriors with nothing better to do than drag media attention over whatever they're feeling insecure about this month/year. For those of you who might be on the fence about watching a Caucasian actress in the role that (supposedly) should've been reserved to an Asian actress, please consider this a NON-MATTER and watch it anyway. The character she is portraying is SUPPOSED to look Caucasian/white. It was the same in the source material and even the creator of that anime said so in interviews.Now, is the movie any good? In my opinion, yes. Yes it was. It wasn't amazing but at the very least entertaining. There is a good amount of people who score this a 1/10 because they are butt hurt that the story was changed a lot. Please ignore them and see for yourself even if you're a fan of the anime and are able to keep an open mind. I think maybe I was able to judge it more objectively because I had zero knowledge about the story in the anime going in, but, if nothing else, the movie actually made me want to watch those old ones to compare.The acting - 7.5/10 - Since Scarlett Johansson is the only big name that the movie is being marketed alongside, I'd say she did a good job. At no point in the movie could I say she didn't belong there. She played the part of cyborg who had difficulty belonging in a human world very well. The cast is diverse enough in my opinion, though some of them get pretty little screen time.The visuals - 9/10 - If there is one point most critics/viewers are in alignment concerning this movie, that point is definitely the visuals. The movie both looks and feels spectacular, with the futuristic city looking like a close-future mix of Blade Runner and TRON. The combination of CGI and practical effects looks organic, the movie's powerful themes of excessive self-augmentation and technology almost running amok represented very well visually.Soundtrack - 8/10 - Sometimes pretty subdued, sometimes almost-but-not-quite in your face, I found the soundtrack to vary between decent and very good in some moments. It didn't MAKE the movie but it enhanced a good deal in my opinion.Story - 7/10 - Here is where the good points of the movie kinda start to run dry. A lot of other people would probably rate it a lot lower, with 5 or 4's if they're at least trying to be objective. Yes, the story is fairly predictable, and the fact that the movie is only around 100 minutes long doesn't do it any favors either. Here is probably where most of the legitimate hate towards this movie stems from. The creators adapted a story that had a lot more depth and philosophical insight and turned it into a somewhat generic cyborg coming of age story mixed with an evil corporation doing questionable things. The villain is also very cookie-cutter and has almost zero depth. HOWEVER, I do think that concerning this film's particular themes and narrative, a weak villain doesn't hurt it so much since its more about losing/gaining your humanity through technology than any bad guy trying to shoot you.Writing/Dialogue - 6/10 - By far the movie's weakest aspect. In fact, I believe if some more meaningful dialogue and character interactions were written into this film, it could've easily been 1 or 2 points higher on anyone's scoring system. As it is, the dialogue is shallow and fairly run-of-the-mill for about half the movie's length. Some bits of good interactions are sprinkled here and there, and thankfully that's enough to preserve the soul of the movie's central theme of human souls surviving in machine bodies, BUT not enough to give Ghost in the Shell the depth it should've inherited from the source material.Overall - I gave this movie 8/10 stars here on IMDb, mostly because I couldn't give it a 7.5 which felt more appropriate to me. My advice would be to not listen to the whitewashing nonsense, because that's exactly what it is, nonsense. Also don't listen to the haters who rate this movie a 1/10 or call it crap because those people should not be reviewing anything to begin with. It is a decent movie, with great visuals and a theme that might get you thinking for a couple of days after seeing it. The acting is decent, with an above average performance from Scarlett and a good soundtrack that might hit the right spot on occasion. The only bad aspects, like I mentioned, are the film's rather short running time and weak dialogue/writing which hold it back from being truly great.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

The scenery was amazing- -I was wishing they had filmed more of the scenes at night. The daytime scenery was OK, but like Las Vegas it seemed drab compared to the night time cinematography. The futuristic world that 'Ghost in the Shell' creates is the most advanced science fiction I've ever witnessed--you never knew the robots from the ""enhanced"" humans and just regular, normal characters seemed to in the minority. By now it would be hard to recognize Scarlet Johanson playing some other character than a sci-fi super hero or advanced, experimental being.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I was intrigued mainly by the special effects and they didn't disappoint (though a bit different then I imagined). The story is one that is timeless, relatable to anyone. Finding meaning in ones life, and discovering what it is to be alive is understated in our day to day lives, and this film I think does a great job nailing that main point into you, and for that it's good. It did its job to make me sad, and to guide me through my quest as an individual, supported with amazing visuals and a meh plot. I think it's worth watching and deciding on your own how you feel about it, since it's for sure at the least not a waste of time.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Sure, the ideas are no longer as groundbreaking as they were when The Matrix copied them, but this film swallows the viewer into its grungy, cyberpunk world because the visuals are so rich with detail. This film nails the look and tone of the anime, while introducing changes to the story that largely work. One departure that made this movie a 9 instead of a 10 for me was the relative simplicity of the plot. While the series and movies had notoriously complicated and fast moving plots, this movie decided to simplify to a level that was predictable. I was looking forward to concentrating on the details of the dialogue to try and guess what could possibly come next, but instead found myself somewhat disengaged as the beautiful sci-fi rolled by.This was an excellent sci-fi movie and it definitely lived up to my expectations as a fan of the anime.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Watch in 3D to get the full experience of this movie. 4.DO NOT LISTEN TO THE CRITICS. They either never saw original films, are knocking movie before seen, or have another agenda all together. The movie is not perfect but judge for yourself. You most likely will be surprised on how good this movie is. This movie has a lot of positive things it achieved and should be noted. CASTING ISSUE IS IRRELEVANT. Mamoru Oshii, the director of the original anime adaptation of Ghost in the Shell, said that he has no problem with Johansson playing a role many have understood to be an Asian woman. His reasoning? Ghost in the Shell's main character is a cyborg with no fixed form or race, he explained to IGN, so he doesn't consider Johansson's casting as Hollywood whitewashing.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Apart from that I would say this is one of the best adaptations in real image we could have get. It captures perfectly the feeling of the original anime. For start, I would say that this is not a direct remake because there are many ideas from the original anime kept here, but I think for making it for a bigger public, they introduced more action, a few changes in the script and a little of romance. Overall the script plays with the idea of the ethics of the robotics and androids, as the anime did, and talks about a not very far future full of cyborgs and with very little humanity. The acting was great, although a few supporting characters were a bit useless, but I think Scarlett did an amazing job as the Mayor, as some of the other main characters, like Bateau or the leader of the Section 9. Other thing that is amazing of this movie is the awesome visuals that are used throughout the movie. They really transport you to a future city of Japan and make you feel like you were there. All the cinematography and the visuals make the movie worth to be watched at a cinema. Also I have to mention the perfect score made by Clint Mansell and Lorne Balfe, a masterpiece full of synths that help the action sequences, but also the emotive moments, to be even better (what a shame it's not going to be released). Overall I would recommend this movie to the real fans of the original anime, but also to any other person who wants a great movie with awesome visuals and a great story. 9/10Don't listen to the critics and get an opinion by yourself by watching this.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Honestly, I never thought the 1995 movie was that great. So I'm happy this live action version was not 100% faithful to that movie. I haven't read the manga, so I can't comment on how faithful it is to that. And I don't really care, since I enjoyed this movie so much. If I have only one complaint about this movie, it's that they explained what ghost in the shell means at the very beginning. That was an unnecessary way to use the exposition to make the rest of the movie less confusing. IMO, it wouldn't have been confusing anyway, so they could have left that on the cutting room floor.Beyond that, though, the visuals are stunning. With one exception, the action scenes are very engaging (the one exception being the dark action scene where you can't really see what's going on, but that was brief). The casting is perfect. Yes, I would have preferred a Japanese actress for Major, but I can fully understand why they chose Scarlett Johansson. She's gorgeous and has the box office draw. And it really didn't make a difference for me. She played the part well. Pilou Asbæk was the perfect choice for Batou, too. I give it a solid 8, and would recommend the movie to anyone.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

I was afraid they were going to neuter this like they did with Aeon Flux. Don't worry, they didn't flux it up.The screenplay is the weakest part of the film. Scarlett Johansson is not really hot enough to play the Major; but her portrayal was acceptable.The reviewers who are panning this movie remind me of the dopes who talk about rap music like it is some great art form and really deep and profound. My criticism of the manga was that it got too philosophical and existential at times.Not everybody has seen GITS or SAC so I think that those who haven't will like it; and I expect at least a couple of sequels. However, the producers should probably hire some of the writers of GITS or SAC.Oh yeah; the people complaining about white washing this film obviously have not seen the source material. The Major is white. So is Batou and Togusa and Aramaki. However Aramaki and Togusa are played by Japanese actors in the movie.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Just like many others, I heard of negative reviews and, though I was always going to see it, I was a little concerned. How foolish.Just remember... people these days LOVE to hate and bring things down. If something isn't exactly what they expected it to be, 'wham', negative reviews and, like a virus, people catch the 'negativity' and it blows up in a hate wave of disappointment from people with more opinion than they deserve.I went in to the movie like this, expecting something bad and came out rather satisfied.Breakdown: Ghost in the Shell went to A lot of effort to get some scenes exactly right as in the anime. It was a beautiful movie which followed the same story with some slight modifications. All the actors did a great job. It was so good to see the world of Ghost in the Shell (anime) come to life. The very ending was different but, to be honest, before I went in the movie I knew the very ending of the anime wouldn't work in a movie like this. I'm glad they changed it.Summary: Don't listen to critics or people how love to tear things down. This movie deserved to do better than what it has but people have caught the 'virus' and are selling the movie short. It was a great watch. 8/10.Ben.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

The visual were beyond stunning, the characters interesting and while the story wasn't as deep as it could have been it was still pretty good. I think all the criticism for this movie has been way too harsh, the end product was really well made and if this movie hadn't been an adaption but a regular sci-fi movie I'm pretty more viewers would have appreciated it more. I have no problem admitting that my worries about Scarlett Johansson were for naught, she was actually really great playing Major and after having actually watched the movie I found the whole whitewashing ""scandal"" to be totally overblown... Seriously, both the fictional world and her team contained a wide ethnic diversity, so it wasn't like you had one Caucasian among Asians (and therefore sticking out like a sore thumb). I felt a lot of effort was put into creating a rich world, making sure that the inhabitants were fully incorporated and that their actions wouldn't feel out of place. This is after all only a movie adaption, there is only so much you can cram into such a format and changes are necessary. Sure, they could have chosen an Asian actress to play Major but in this story that detail isn't even that important... it's just a ""shell"" so to speak. The important thing is to keep the essence of the original and make sure the unavoidable changes feel logical and incorporated in both the story and the world setting as a whole. I feel that a lot of people just couldn't see pass that and that saddens me.This is not a perfect movie by any means, it was really enjoyable and I wholeheartedly recommend it. I even registered just leave this review, because I felt so bad about all the undeservedly criticism. One more tip from me, do watch it in 3D if possible. The effects really added something extra in my opinion.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Is there space for any anima? I don't no. In GHOST IN THE SHELL there is. What I was more interested in is whether there can be something like a hard to grasp anima within a totally digital 3D sci-fi IMAX production full of neon lights, holograms and bodies materializing and dematerializing in a landscape so obviously made out of ones and zeros? I need that anima to feel any empathy. And I need to feel empathy to lose and find myself within the cinematic world, to have the essential experience of catharsis. It did work for me, despite all the technical fuzz on the surface which is, in this case, the right, adequate form for its underlying, spiritual theme. It did work because of the story and its climatic composition, speeding up to an orgasmic high near the ending and it worked because of the magnificent performance throughout the cast. As long as the story and the actors manage to keep your emotions flowing, the rest becomes a not that important mask. It becomes almost irrelevant noise.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The live version of the animated 1995 Japanese Oshii movie offers up a much more coherent and visually stunning experience of the robotic human hybrid genre. Shirow Masasume the writer for the original anime gets to improve on his original script as well as incorporate various scenes from his first work where various set designs and scenes bear a striking resemblance with an enhanced, vibrant, and dazzling updated version. The urban landscapes have fleshed out a futuristic Blade Runner (1982) full of the ambiance. Scarlett Johansson stars in this stunning sci fi movie with a character that humanizes the animated version and somewhat softens her character somewhat from Lucy (2014) where she plays a human who accidentally ingests a chemical that enhances one's brain potential which also diminishes her experience of human emotions.Ghost in the Shell shares various human-computer jacked-in elements with its contemporary William Gibson's cyberpunk that resulted in Keanu Reeves in Johnny Mnemonic (1995) and the virtual reality of Virtuosity (1995). And there are plenty of strong mental cognitive images used in this movie that echo back to the classic Keanu Reeves The Matrix (1999) and Jennifer Lopez in The Cell (2000). What sets this movie apart from most of the other cyberpunk movies is its infusion of emotional and moral questions regarding human life and its intersection with the man-made, electronic existence that are only suggested in Phillip K. Dick's script for breakthrough of Total Recall (1990) and attempted later in Isaac Asimov's inspired I, Robot (2004) and Robocop (1987) that was influenced by Blade Runner.The few weaknesses if that's what they are is the Major (Johansson) striking resemblance to her character in Lucy and the ease in which she appears to be overcome in two scenes that don't mesh with her character as a perfect military weapon. Overall, this movie succeeds in its depiction of a possible future with its amazing vibrant and exciting visuals, and futurescape as well as offering a coherent and morally and humanly sensitive reflection what makes us important. A comparable but even more focused and intimate cyberpunk movie is Caradog Jame's The Machine (2013).","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I wonder what would be the rating without angry fans. I for one liked the movie a lot.
I had seen ""Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence"" before watching this movie. I found that one failed, it didn't resonate with me at all, but watched to the end because my friend told me to see it. Compared to that, I found this movie vastly more watchable.
The movie certainly isn't boring. It has a lot of action scenes and an interesting plot: At least for people who don't know the story in advance, this offers lies, betrayal, an unexpected main plot twist and sacrifice. And must say, Tokyo police seems to be quite a vigilante gang in this sci-fi vision.
Special effects weren't top notch, but I liked how the futuristic Tokyo was imagined. There's some Blade Runner influence, but without the destroyed dystopian world bleakness.
Did I have problems Scarlett playing a Japanese cyborg? English spoken language is much bigger immersion breaker to me. Japan is now ethnically very homogenous, but it is getting more international and this is sci-fi. Not a reason big enough to hate the movie for me.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Of course, I didn't expect a faithful adaptation, that's why I didn't even watch the original film that I watched a lot of years ago and I almost didn't remember.I didn't have the need of finding any different detail to the original film, that makes you only focused in destroying and over analyzing the film instead of enjoying it. A fresh mind is way better.I even thought that it was BASED on the Ghost in the Shell world, therefore I didn't have any expectation. I was prepared to enjoy just whatever it was enjoyable.With an amazing first action sequence, I was more than satisfied with the stunning visuals, effects, photography and direction of the scene, enough to think ""wow, after this, it's already worth the money"".Script is just OK. Enough to show Ghost in the Shell ideas, without being pretentious, and with a lack of complex that, yeah, I don't like too much. Scarlet Johansson was amazing, really nice casting choice. Asbæk characterization is amazing and his acting is good enough. Visuals and photography are amazing as I already said. The only mistake? Trying to make the film for the massive public, avoiding complexity of the script and avoiding female nipples.Hey guys, complex films like Inception can make a lot of money too. And a female nipple is something natural, without any intention of being sexualized in this story.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The feature film is the second work by director Rupert Sanders, and the third Johansson's performance as the heroine, after her brilliant job in ""Lucy"" and vigorous saga Marvel's ""Avengers"". Even so the Japanese anime had already been materialized by Palme d'Or winner Mamoru Oshii on a couple of occasions and the final result is indeed admirable in every way, the first flesh and blood appearance (metaphorically speaking) of Motoko Kusanagi comes, a cyborg-human hybrid leader of an elite group and although she shows up clichés of the machine with own intelligence that saves humanity from other gloomy machines and sets a chain of ethical and philosophical aftermaths on her past and future, Sanders' work, too scrupulous to the panels of the reference source, feels like a progression of skills refreshing the unproductive creative day-to-day.At a glance, everyone infers which aspect takes all the praises. Visual effects and production design carry out fully what they were proposing, arousing a thorough immersion in that futuristic city of a reality that is not too far away, which drinks respectfully from sci-fi masterpieces as Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" and Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"". Transferring the majority of wonders of the cyberpunk book to live action was a total insanity, considering that they should overcome two major hindrances: The first one is the difficulty that surrounds manufacture of every notion of the world on which it is based, work elaborated with mastery by artistic directors, who spent whole months handcrafting many of the elements which are seen on screen, improving their meritorious work; and the second one is to free itself from American mania about maximizing even the dullest feature, losing the basic elements of the main culture. Although the artists uproot the most notorious traditions of the Eastern country, they convince of the tempestuous empowerment of science technologies in our daily life. If a cinematographic production was to be regarded a masterpiece by the glory of its pictures, Paramount's work would obtain the award without delay; it's a delectation to be carried away by the gorgeous skill of the filmmaker: the visual section. He showed his half-baked talent regularly in his directorial debut, now he ratifies his knowledge with sinister robotic geishas, a palette of nuanced colors which represent the scintillation of social darkness, choreographed fight moves and exciting action sequences that benefit from bullet time and magic sound distortions to achieve the desired impact, technological atmosphere isn't lost even in the most futile fragment, all here fits, this conformity has power and harmony, which demands to be contemplated on the big screen.Considering that the story has the signatures of three dissonant writers, clearly, the plot, based on the comic of Masamune Shirow, was going to be saturated with a complex of different proposals and looks, with resolutions don't maintain a common term. Although screenwriters trio were very respectful by extracting the vital skeleton of the manga and the films, they palliate metaphysical burden, perhaps it wasn't decided lightly, since they had to exhibit in a flexible, congenial and seductive way a work, which is the mother for many of the existential audiovisual productions of today (""Ex Machina"" ""Her"" or ""Westworld""), in other words, what's adapt an original idea? Modernize or preserve the name of an ontological sci- fi classic? This implies that the film doesn't get the same emotional and reflective blow as 1995 movie, opting to present minimal background in the prologue, thoughtful instants where Johansson possibly broods what and/or who is and that's the whole ideological implanted environment, one more incident in which Hollywood replaces depth narrative by weapons and flagrant impressions pleasing the eye , but not to the mind, of course, a less emphatic case, but in the end, one more case, and I don't blame them, because the real guilty of that awful trend is audience, who believe that cinema is a temporary amusement, something ""entertaining"", something transitory.As one of the contemporary films with more remuneration repercussions by controversial ""whitewashing"", we can determine (again) it's completely an unfounded affirmation. Perhaps the most vehement fans want the adaptation to be coupled with their demands and fantasies, but with the American film monster in the boss role, it was to be expected that a superstar plays the leading role. An interesting performance made by ""Under the Skin"" actress as Major, she's who allows the audience to follow the story, but to a certain extent, since Johansson's charming performance as a cyborg-woman doesn't get to break the chains of well-known resolutions.""Ghost in the Shell"" is wounded by nostalgia for the original movie, despite this, rating it as an independent product, is a worthy adaptation; it rebuilds some things around here, replicates identically another thing over there, however, absurdly, is another feature film that Hollywood makes fairly well. This story of origins would be the direct access to the profitable and vigorous franchise that Scarlett Johansson has been looking for and that Marvel has been unwilling to give her, but based on the grossing of the last few days, sadly, it's concluded that the American audience, one of the most fervent film consumers, has literally turned its back on it, and that isn't a good thing. The sexual burden is quietly watered down and the inherently philosophical ghost is quietly destroyed, Rupert Sanders executes a blockbuster that feels a little hollow, which concentrates on presenting magnificently to Major, establishing an enemy with moral grudges and an open ending. However, performances and technical production are high; they manage to introduce in our minds a message: the need for more ""Ghost in the Shell"". It's unlikely, but if they reconstruct the narrative flaws present in this one in an uncertain sequel, it would clearly be a masterpiece, but at the moment, at least in the visual thing, is already taking enlarge steps to it.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

But to be honest, I think it serves for objectivity. Nevertheless, i'm not a fan of recreations of great movies. I know one example where I liked the remake more then the original: ""Girl with a dragon tattoo"". On the other side, I could not finish movies like the remakes of ""Let the right one in"", ""Oldboy"" or ""The Experiment"". I'm also not into the recent life-action adaptations of Disney movies like ""The Jungle Book"", ""Cinderella"" or ""The Beauty and the Beast"". Not that they are bad movies, they just add nothing new and therefore I kinda watched them unemotional.But let's get to ""Ghost in the Shell"". Maybe I'm lucky by not having the original in mind, but i kinda liked the movie. The world was depicted very well. I liked all the characters and their motivations. I enjoyed the action-sequences and the plot. Probably the biggest flaw in my opinion was the little underwhelming finale of the movie. The movie has a run-time of approx. 150 minutes, but it didn't feel that long. So I was kinda surprised of the ending. I would have liked a more meaningful ending.So to say praises to the director and art director, I really loved every little visual detail.

It could be bought in limited outlets like SunCoast Video, MediaPlay, etc.I was in love with the original film not only for it's action, attention to detail in weapons/gear, and appreciably grounded view of future tech...but also it's deep view of existential questions, the pitfalls of technology, social/political themes, and character development in the movie and following series. Of course, like today, it was widely regarded as too complex and cerebral for those who had no exposure to other types and styles of film, and regrettably dismissed by those who considered an animated film to only be suitable for children's stories.Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to take some air of superiority in my tastes, I like a good brainless or mainstream film just as much as anyone, but the original GITS was a landmark and a very cherished memory of my teen years. THE MEAT AND POTATOES: I went into this film with an understanding that adaptations of franchises like anime and video games, have often failed to meet the expectations of fans and newcomers alike. Lets face it, most of our beloved franchises are deep and vast. And to take the best parts of those and wrap it into a film that tries to honor the original work is no small task. Not to mention please typical moviegoers who are used to films that lay out the plot in a very predictable or even simplistic way.This movie touches on all the amazing parts of the original. The story in this movie is lifted from several parts of the movie as well as it's episodic versions. I personally think they did a wonderful job of faithfully preserving the best of the best.The plot may not be as ""sexy"" as modern films go, but for those who suspend their typical expectations, it's a wonderful dive into ideas of what it means to be human when the technology of the time may be at odds with individuality. While most of our lives are inexorably connected to technology and networking, there were definitely parts that drew a comparison of being ""too connected"" to technology (i.e. social media, phones, computers, and corporate advertising), whilst seeing the inherent value of ""disconnecting"" from such trappings occasionally in order to discover oneself so to speak. I thought the running time was a little short. Even 30 more minutes could've developed the story better to folks who are viewing this with fresh eyes. However I can also understand the need to trim ""filler"" for the sake of giving the film a broader appeal. Though I really wished for more development of the characters aside from the Major, (Togusa, Saito, Ishikawa, Borma, Aramaki), I felt like the other roles were portrayed faithfully and yet breathed new life into their characters. I really hope this will not be the end of the series if nothing else but for the sake of exploring these characters more and seeing the actors flesh out their roles. Unlike most films with a central character, the movie and the series really took time to make each of these characters very unique and made me love each of their personalities and quirks.The tech, weapons, gear, concepts that were of course laid out in the first movie, were mostly well preserved and adapted. In closing I personally loved this movie and am glad to see it directed/produced/casted/created in a manner that stayed true to it's roots. Make no mistake, you are not seeing a film that is trying to be like most major blockbusters. And it is also not a direct clone of the original. But don't mistake this for an indication of avoiding it. Get lost in it, let it have your undivided attention and I think most can appreciate this wonderful dive into the unknown.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

It is NOT as good as it's counterpart, the original animated movie. However, this movie is not bad, and while it drew a lot from the original movie, it takes on a slightly different direction in the plot, character development/focus and appeal. It has been a good number of years since I watched the original, so I had only a mild recollection of the movie going in to this one, which was nice, because I was trying a little harder to figure in this movie, vs scrutinizing and comparing. So in that respect, if you have any interest in seeing this movie, forget watching the animated one, right before.Scarlett Johansson did an adequate job playing the Major, but she certainly did not play the Major of old, and I did find her some what more 'distant' than what might have been required. Her almost complete lack of emotion, and the way the introduction, year later scene really made it hard for me to buy in to the character. However I did find the ending very touching.The plot diverges enough so that you are not watching the same movie, and I felt the performance/story of 'Kuze' was very provocative and complemented Johansson very well. I would give the movie 1.5 thumbs up, with respect to most of what Hollywood is producing, it gets two solid thumbs up. & Yeah, Takeshi Kitano, almost worth the price of admission right there.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

So this is the reason northern Europe is still full of those, but it will be lost soon...If you are developing any cyborg, what will he look alike? It was a genius decision to give him blue eyes...
Maybe green eyes would be even more fitting.
So a Cyvorg can look like you want him to be and you give him brown eyes? Boring, I asssume. Humanity beeing brown eyed mostly,

The title was originally inspired by the phrase ""the Ghost in the Machine"", which was 20th century British philosopher Gilbert Ryle's derisive description of 17th century French philosopher René Descartes' concept of mind-body dualism. From Ryle's phrase arose the Japanese entertainment franchise ""Ghost in the Machine"". Originally a seinen manga series (comics targeted at adolescent boys and young men) that appeared in 1989, the comics were adapted into a 1995 feature film (which reportedly helped inspire ""The Matrix""), followed be several other films, a television series and video games. The American live-action adaptation is clearly designed for wider international appeal and features a diverse cast, but has been criticized for ""whitewashing"" because of casting a white actress (Scarlett Johansson) in the lead role of this Japanese property (although many Japanese, including the director of the original anime films, said that this was a non-issue). Besides all that, this film also seems influenced by the visuals, mood and plot of films like ""The Terminator"" (1984), ""Total Recall"" (1990), ""Minority Report"" (2002) and the ""Bourne"" series, but with an identity all its own.In the future (in mid-21st century Japan, according to the manga, even though the film is less specific), technology allows for the enhancement of human beings with cybernetic limbs and organs so they can function better and live longer but it doesn't stop there. Science has now gotten to the point where a human brain can be placed in a completely cybernetic body, allowing for the creation of a virtually indestructible super soldier with human intelligence and sensibilities (which, by the way, can be technologically manipulated too). Major Mira Killian is the first of her kind – the first completely successful implantation of a human brain into an artificial body (and a very shapely one at that – covered only with a skin tight silver/grey spandex-looking suit). Sure, Major has to regularly take medicine to keep her human brain from rejecting her manufactured body, she sometimes experiences disturbing and unexplained memory glitches and she wishes she could remember more of her past than the story of childhood tragedy she has been told (and she wishes she knew what it was to feel), but, hey, she's a Hanka Corporation success story and the Hanka CEO (Peter Ferdinando) wants more just like her.The action takes place in a crowded cosmopolitan city with unusual-looking buildings, bright lights of many different colors and giant holograms of people doing various activities (which aren't explained, but are probably some form of futuristic advertising campaigns.) Major leads a team called Section 9, which includes an enhanced human named Batou (Danish actor Pilou Asbæk) and which finds and neutralizes the criminals that ordinary law enforcement can't handle. Under the supervision of Chief Daisuke Aramaki (Takeshi Kitano) and with Dr. Ouélet (Juliette Binoche) and her high-tech machinery ""healing"" Major when a mission gets too physical, the whole thing is working like a well-oiled machine (or well-programmed computer) until mysterious hacker Hideo Kuze (Michael Pitt) shows up. Kuze seems to know more, be more elusive and more determined than most criminals. He's killing Hanka scientists – and repeatedly leaving behind a cryptic holographic warning, ""Collaborate with Hanka robotics and be destroyed!"" Even as Major pursues Kuze, she's wondering if that statement is a threat... or a warning.""Ghost in the Shell"" is visually stunning, exciting and deep. The images that director Rupert Sanders (""Snow White and the Huntsman"") put on screen are almost too much to take in, but it's a lot of fun to try and you can't help but marvel at their Oscar-worthy quality. The assembled work of screenwriters Jamie Moss (""Street Kings""), William Wheeler (""The Lego Ninjago Movie"", ""Queen of Katwe"") and Ehren Kruger (three of the ""Transformers"" movies, ""Arlington Road"") combine to give us an interesting story and a few moments of reflection about what it means to be human and the nature of reality. The diverse cast fits together well, without a weak link, and Johansson is so good that I can almost forgive her for 2014's utterly ridiculous sci-fi actioner ""Lucy"". Johansson's 2017 enhanced character actually makes some sense – and is much more interesting to watch – and the movie is much more fun. You should check it out. I mean, you might as well, before the inevitable sequels. Regardless, this one makes for an enjoyable two hours at the movies.

"8","/10","I am probably biased, but I liked it more than the original 1995 anime...let the angry comments commence.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3675830/?ref_=tt_urv","johnplocar","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur61307586/?ref_=tt_urv","1 April 2017","I just want to give a slight bit of background as to where I was coming from when I went into this movie before I say how I felt about it. I have only recently seen the original animated 1995 film; I haven't seen any of its numerous sequels or spin-off shows or read any of the mangas that were linked to its source material or anything like that. How I felt about the 1995 anime though is pretty lukewarm honestly. I thought it had interesting ideas and a relatively cool aesthetic, but was way too heavy on exposition dialog and had a very limited about of character development as well as humanity. For a film that is supposed to be delving into the questions of what makes us human to feel so lifeless, to me, is a major issue. Objectively speaking, it is a fine movie, but subjectively falls short of being anything that great.This movie is one of those rare cases where I found myself enjoying the remake far more than the original film that it is based on. This cut out a lot of the mind-numbing, on the nose, irritating dialog that padded out the anime and replaced it with some characters that I could get myself invested in and a story that I was actually interested in. It didn't spend large gaps of its run time so it could go on a lecture about what makes us human, instead it minimized that to play out more in its themes and implications. The characters have ten times more personality in this which was also a glaring problem from the anime for me. I liked a couple of these characters and wanted to see their personal arches. Scarlett Johansson, I think, does a pretty solid job as 'The Major'. I don't have nearly the problem with her in the role as much as everyone else in America seems to with the whole ""white-washing"" thing as of late. Admittedly I was concerned about that when the trailers for this movie did hit the internet, but while watching the film itself I was totally fine with her in this role as well as her performance. The story isn't a 100% faithful adaptation of the '95 movie, so I don't know if it borrowed anything from the rest of its original franchise. With that said, I liked this narrative a lot more as well. I thought it had a satisfying beginning, middle and end. It flowed fairly well and I was intrigued as to where it was going the whole way through. With a movie like this, it does run the risk of feeling extremely derivative of other sci-fi films that have explored these themes or world aesthetics before, but luckily that never happened for me. I did get hints of familiarity occasionally of other films such as ""Blade Runner"", ""RoboCop"", and ""Dark City""; however it never became too distracting so I was able to brush it off or even find myself to enjoy the experience more so. Beware thought that this film is a pretty slow burn; think less of this being a straight up action film, but rather a downtempo styled mystery with action beats every so often. The CGI, for 99% of this movie, is top notch and is absolutely gorgeous; even mind blowing in some instances with its cinematography. I thought this was one hell of a spectacle, I think the film was aware of how good it looked as well because there are plenty of establishing shots of the city. Which I did find to be a bit much, but it wasn't too bad. And the soundtrack was fantastic, really synthesizer heavy and I am a true sucker for a good synth score to a movie.All around I found this to be an enjoyable film, does it have its problems? Sure, character development for some of the leads could have been fleshed out much more. The pace of the film could have been tweaked to its benefit, whether that to be speeding up through certain story threads or slowing down in others. 'The Major' could have had more humanizing moments instead of feeling more robotic. For me though, I didn't mind this relatively minor gripes I had with it. Maybe that's because I see an improvement from its source so that may have blinded me some, but I still had a good time with this film. I liked it and am actually looking forward to exploring this universe more in hopefully future installments. If you're a fan of the original then I don't really know how you may end up feeling about this remake, for all I know fans will end up hating it and I will be in a very small boat about this topic. But if what I said interests you at all then I say go check it out. If not...""Boss Baby"" is probably playing down the hall, have at it.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I went in expecting to be a little disappointed, not because of reviews or casting controversy, but because it's an adaptation and they are rarely as good as the original. But, I have to admit to being pleasantly surprised.This must be reviewed two ways: 1. As it's own entity - Firstly, it is visually stunning. You will be hard pressed to find better cinematography this year. The action is solid and interesting, the acting up to spec although there is nothing that particularly stands out. The main themes ask the questions of how we value consent and whether that would be diluted in a world where your memories and identity can be manipulated without you ever knowing. They also ask how we define humanity in a cyborg world but this is a little heavy handed at times. My biggest criticism is that sometimes the film seems to abandon logic in a few small circumstances. In Hollywood action movies this wouldn't matter but Ghost in the Shell is more intelligent than that so it was a little disappointing to see. Overall though it's a clever and exciting sci-fi thriller. Stand Alone Score: 8/102. As an adaptation - Of what though? This film takes material from the original manga, and also the TV series and movies which were separate adaptations as well. There is no such thing as a loyal adaptation of Ghost in the shell's story. To date, This is the fourth attempt. So how do we compare? Well we look at the themes again. The question of how we define humanity in a world of increasing cyberization is central to the franchise. The film addresses this but in a way that lacks the subtlety of previous incarnations. Having said that, it asks questions and adds emotional heft that previous installments have never attempted and it's stronger for it. This helps it contribute to the franchise - it's not just a pale copy. The other thing to judge is the story beats it takes from the other material. The villain is from the TV show, many visuals and fight scenes are taken from the movie, the opening scene is a blending of those from both the animated film and it's sequel. By taking these scenes and folding them into a new story it lets the movie feel familiar while also adding something new. Will fans be disappointed that it's not a beat for beat adaptation? Probably, we usually are, but in this case I think the film is better for it. Adaptation score: 7I recommend this movie. It has been buried under negative reviews fueled by casting controversies that don't have any impact on the movie itself. A hugely underrated film and one that will be vindicated in the future as have so many other movies that opened with terrible reviews and went on to be revered.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

The movie deviates from the original anime in terms of concepts (the ending of the anime is different from the movie) but I would say it is more realistic and logical. For those who do not follow the anime, if they watch the original 1995 anime movie they would not understand some of the gist especially the ending but with the movie it is a fresh work of its own by itself. From beginning to end, you will be able to follow and it is high action most of the time with a good plot that attempts to explained all that has happened within the short time frame of the movie. One part that is a bit hard to follow is the dialogue switch from Japanese to English with the words all over the place instead of at the bottom. Makes you miss some of the dialogue.

That, my friend, is a double edged sword.What happens when you take the Actress from Lucy, Avengers and Her, then place said name actress in an already established series? Character residue. Simply put, as a fan of the Manga, the previous Ghost in the Shell movies, and SAC, I can't get this ""Lucy"" taste out of my brain. In terms of Art Direction, it's Great. In terms of referencing source material, they did a good job. But at the end of the day, casting was DEFINITELY AN ISSUE (& not from a whitewashing standpoint). In the movie Gravity, George Clooney was very distracting for me. Why? Because even as an Astronaut, he was basically ""Danny Ocean in Space."" ScarJo did a fantastic job, but TYPECASTING is my issue. As a fan of this Series, I am now stuck with this amalgamation of ScarJo characters in my favorite anime. Thanks. Thanks a lot. *insert straight face emoji*Good film for fans of the series, but custom made for fans of ScarJo.Irony: A film about stripping self identity, while the actual film strips self identity.

I'm just interested in watching an entertaining and visually-interesting 3D sci-fi action movie. Bonus points if things get deep & mysterious!While Ghost in the Shell didn't scratch much deeper than the surface, and while its mysteries were resolved in a simple (yet satisfactory) manner, this movie did scratch that itch in 3D eye-candy! One of the best showcases for this medium. I watched the Bluray in my Meta Quest 3 headset, the screen - extremely curved - filling more than my entire field-of-view...mega immersive! Excellent depth.Overall an entertaining, engaging & fun 110 minutes. The action was good, Scarlet is a convincing hero (tho' a little monotone, character-wise). The plot is fine. Soundtrack nice. Support cast mostly decent, except Juliette Binoche feels miscast and the villain (the actual villain) is blandly predictable. Generally the philosophical ideas it has are tropes at this stage, and the film didn't approach them at a unique or interesting enough angle to truly stand out.What pushes this to an 8/10 however are a couple of strong scenes which hint at philosophical depths potential sequels could flesh out. One involving a 'possessed' trucker's inability to remember his daughter is particularly haunting.If you dial down your expectations, ignore external criticisms you may have heard and choose the 3D version on as big a screen as possible...then for sure you'll enjoy this! Superior to the similar Battle Angel Alita I saw recently.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I thought this movie was not good without ever having seen it, flash forward to 2024-ish, just saw it and I was thrilled. This movie is great and it manages to do the impossible if not improbable, surpass or at least match the anime original. Scarlet Johansson delivers a precise performance, giving me the viewer exactly what I was looking for. That might sound like a coldly analytical statement but what it means is she could have played Major in a variety of different ways but she stuck to the recipe and the quintessential character was brought to life. The action scenes were equally the proper measure of visuals, editing and pacing.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","No Matter What You Do","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3718459/?ref_=tt_urv","Snootz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur49392222/?ref_=tt_urv","28 May 2017","Advice to movie makers: whenever you make a movie from an existing manga or anime, realize that no matter what you do, no matter how good the directing and acting, regardless of how excellent the CGI and other special effects are-- anime fans are going to rake you over the coals. It doesn't matter whether you follow the story to-the-letter, improvise a bit, or give the audience a new divergent plot to feast on... you're not going to be able to do it ""right"" (ie, as each individual person thinks it should have been done). That's the issue going in. It's like trying to make a new Star Wars or Star Trek film. It's an uphill battle.That said, I hope what I post here is fair to the movie as a movie. I decided to NOT RATE this film, because I have mixed feelings about many parts of it. The film is different, unique, fascinating to say the least. The body count is way high and for my taste too violent... but it IS Ghost in the Shell. Anyone other than ""went to see it for Scarlett Johansson"" viewers should not be surprised. So to discuss the basics:Directing is pretty good. Flaws? Yes. Who decided to have a main character speak in Japanese when everyone else is speaking English? That's goofy and having to read what he's saying distracts from the visuals, yanking the viewer out of the story and reminding us ""this is a movie"". Bad move there.But other than that the whole film flows very smoothly and is easily followed by all audiences (not just hard-core anime fans). Plot: Yes, they had to simplify the plot. This movie is aimed at mainstream audience, not just the anime sector. To be frank, the original GitS tended to talk itself to death. It was so plot-heavy it dragged on in many places. If they'd have done lengthy droning monologues in this film they'd have killed it out of the chute. Most people don't want (or need) characters going on and on and on about the psychological and ethical ramifications of a cyborg world, the intimate internal thoughts of angst-ridden emo-borgs, or heavy-concept nerdNet technobabble. This isn't anime-- it's a mainstream movie and it was made for the entertainment of mainstream audiences. Considering the target audience, I think they did very well plot-wise. They presented the good and the bad, the lovely and the ugly, and covered the issues quite well all things considered. As with all adaptations they had to pick-and-choose what to present or not present. If someone wants to deep-dive the plot concepts, they can still watch the anime. The question is: did they tell a story and did they get the main points down? I think they did.Scarlett Johansson has two expressions in this film: blank and wrinkled-brow. Was she the right actress for this film? Consider what the Major is: a full-bot body cyborg. In the original anime she was very much without emotion or expression (with few exceptions). In the original the major's eyes often looked blank and staring off into space-- intentionally. Scarlett certainly pulled that off. The one thing that bothered me (and why didn't the director catch this and correct it?) was a repeated and continual ""hunched over"" look from Johansson. That makes no sense. She's a full-body cyborg; her posture should have been near perfect even in action scenes. Head bent forward and shoulders slouching? That is so out-of-character it stood out as prominent. The rest of the actors? Pretty decent. Pulled off the roles as expected. I loved Pilou Asbæk as Batou. And the beagle was fun.CGI: Totally over the top-- and rightly so. If someone thinks the CGI distracted from the concept and plot-- they missed the point of Ghost in the Shell. This world is technology gone rabid. At what point does humanity disappear and tech take over? Every time we turned around the CGI was pushing that concept deep into the framework of the story. If it had been any less over-the-top I'd have been disappointed. As it is-- I was fascinated by the constant ""tech noise"" going on in the background. Distracting? You bet. It was SUPPOSED to be. Makes the entire film ripe for hunting ""Easter Eggs"" when the Blu-Ray comes out.That's about it. Movie. Plot. Crisis. Climax. Resolution. Decent twist. Reasonable angst. Blurring between who's the good guy and who's not. Flawless? I've never seen a flawless film. Did it accomplish what it should have? I'd say the general audience probably enjoyed it quite a bit. Anime fans can be a bit critical and ""passionate"", so judging from that viewpoint can be useless. I've never respected most critics (who put them in charge?). I always ask the question, ""What if I'd never seen the original anime?"" ""Was the movie enjoyable on its own merits?"" That's all any movie should be judged on.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

"","","Laymen Will Love It, Nerds A Little Less So","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4052200/?ref_=tt_urv","iNickR","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81151113/?ref_=tt_urv","3 February 2018","Ghost in the Shell, in short, is a futuristic story about a young woman (Scarlett Johansson), saved from a horrible crash and then turned into a cyborg. She then becomes a lethal government killing machine, going after the world's worst criminals.Ghost in the Shell, what I think: I watched this Movie because of all the hype surrounding the cyberpunk Netflix thriller, Altered Carbon (2018). A lot of comparisons have been made between the two (and Blade Runner), but, although there are some similarities, they are quite different. Scar-Jo plays the protagonist, Major. All that she remembers about the accident is that she drowned while immigrating to the country as a refugee on a raft. Both Major's parents were killed, and her body was damaged beyond repair. Her brain was saved, though, and a cybernetic-body custom built around it. Major is essentially a ghost in a shell with very little knowledge of her past life. She's told she is one-of-a-kind.So Major transforms into an ass-kicker who can't feel pain, or fear, and uses this to her advantage to track down and arrest, or whatever, the worst-of-the-worst criminals no matter the human or financial cost. Life as a cyborg isn't as simple as you may think, especially when you're a potential golden goose for the company that built you. They have big plans for Major, and her team of partially-cyber-enhanced ass-kickers, but that platform seems to conflict with the government's own ideas.The CGI is what you should expect out of a big-budget sci-fi thriller - excellent. The action is good, the sound-mix is awesome, the script is so-so. I thought Scar-Jo's acting was meh - sort of, well, robotic. She's an amazing actor, but this role of Major isn't for her. She has this weird gait about her when she walks that's difficult to get used to, even with the understanding that's she's pretty much a robot - super advanced, notwithstanding. The Terminator, Cyberdyne Systems Model 101, is less robotic when walking. For something as high-tech as Major's shell, her movements should be more fluid. But that's just the nerd in me.Two things you'll LIKE about Ghost in a Shell: 1) Like I said, the CGI is great and Sci-fi fans will like it because it's similar to that of Blade Runner (I still can't help but be in awe of CGI technology when it comes to these types of movies). 2) Scarlett Johansson's fight scenes are well choreographed, and she can kick-ass with the best of them (see her in The Avengers).Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) The effort. This movie had so much potential. It doesn't live up to the hype. 2) The length. It's about 17 minutes longer than it should be.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.
