Negatives : Pretty much everything else. Script/ Story made no sense. Seems like a high school kid wrote it. Expected better from Snyder.Dialogues are trash
Acting is non-existent. Even the most emotional scenes are laughableIt is just like an old western where a group of people band together to fight a common enemy except this movie tales place in space. The movie added nothing new just copy pasted the stale idea. I am not sure why Zack was so excited for this movie. The first part was watchable (it sucked) but the 2nd part made no sense.Watch it only if you have time and brain cells to kill.","308 out of 384 found this helpful.

The budget has been blown on special effects and no script. It's like one of those rip off B movies you get on the free to view movie channels. I just don't understand why it was made. The Creator and both the recent Godzilla films are far superior to this. The only reason I am giving this a 4 is for some of the special effects and action scenes- the acting is so wooden especially when they tell each other about their pasts. Part 1 is superior but I would stil only give it 5 as it at least attempts a Magnificent 7 in space type film. This was just a waste of space.","251 out of 354 found this helpful.

I don't know how this managed to be even more dull and boring than that one.The script is so bad, the small amount of dialogue it has is insufferable, the pacing is so bad, it makes an already boring movie even worse. There's a part of the movie that is, montage, small bit of normal scene, more montage, another small bit of normal scene. It's hard to get through.The relationship between the main team is almost nonexistent. You made a whole movie about them meeting, and in the second movie, they still barely talk with each other. In the final battle one of them tells another, ""If I must die"" and the other says ""together"" and it's genuinely the first time they spoke with each other.The exposition is done so horribly. There's literally a scene where they go around a table and each of them does a summary of their origin story, as it's shown in flashbacks. And when most of them are done, one of them actually says ""What about you? You haven't told your story"".Final battle has some nice sequences, but it's filled with just overdramatised moments of sacrifice and death, because these characters are basically cardboard.There are some cool shots, some with the robot Jimmy, but that's all they are, shots that look cool. 0 significance, because we barely see him in the damn movie. And to finish the fight comes that Rebellion that was shown for like 5 minutes in the first movie? Yeah, the guy with the face paint. They just appear. No idea who called them, idk how they knew there was a fight, they just show up. Idk if I missed the part where they were called, because by then I was half asleep.Then obviously there's set up for the third movie. Yeah, I was committed to the 2 parts, I don't have another one of these in me.","434 out of 574 found this helpful.

"7","/10","People are treating Snyder like he killed a puppy","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9745823/?ref_=tt_urv","magadalwarmayur","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur69481828/?ref_=tt_urv","20 April 2024","Alright, so I finally got around to watching Rebel Moon Part 2: The Scargiver, and let me tell you, it's a bit of a rollercoaster ride. On one hand, there's definitely been some improvement since the first film, particularly when it comes to the jaw-dropping action sequences. Seriously, they were inventive, eye-catching, and had me glued to the screen throughout.But here's where things get a little complicated. While the action scenes were a major highlight, it felt like the filmmakers were more focused on laying the groundwork for a potential franchise rather than delivering a standalone, gripping story. This weakened the immediate stakes of the plot, leaving me feeling somewhat disconnected from the characters and their struggles.Now, let's talk about Zack Snyder. The guy's no stranger to controversy, and while I think he gets more flak than he deserves, I can't deny that there were some pacing issues in this film. Plus, some of the characters felt underdeveloped, which was a real missed opportunity considering the potential they had.On the positive side, the visual spectacle of Rebel Moon Part 2 is undeniable. Snyder's signature style shines through, and there are moments of pure cinematic magic that left me in awe. But it's clear that the focus on franchise-building came at the expense of fully fleshing out the story and its characters.So, where does that leave us? Well, if you were a fan of the first Rebel Moon, you'll probably find Part 2 to be a more polished experience. The action is top-notch, and there's definitely a sense of progression in terms of the overall feel of the film. However, if you're looking for a completely satisfying conclusion with high stakes and deep character development, you might be left wanting more.In the end, Rebel Moon Part 2: The Scargiver is a solid improvement over its predecessor, but there's still plenty of room for growth. Here's hoping that any future installments can strike a better balance between franchise-building and delivering a compelling, standalone story.The hate for this film is not justified at all.People are treating zack Snyder like he killed a puppy.","157 out of 362 found this helpful.

The coolest moment was the James the mech with his cloak in his One Punch Man moment.Half the movie was the farmers harvesting wheat and after one day of combat training got a better kill-death ratio than any of the veterans.The other half of the movie was a guy turning the little wheel to aim the Dreadnaught cannon.Remind me never to watch any more Synder movies on Netflix.","267 out of 365 found this helpful.

Soldiers that cannot hit a target in a 1 by 2m passage, high tech ships that smoke like they are diesel powered, soldiers that behave like they were hired as extras on a F-grade scifi film (oh wait that's true)
Fight scenes with energy weapons so close quarters that the fighters would rather hit their enemies with their rifle than shoot them. It's so insanely ridiculous I nearly chewed through my own foot out of frustration.Then the monologues. Lectures by warriors given to villagers they just met, minutes before. More lectures and 20 second ""tragic"" back stories that will make you wish the ""warriors"" telling them were rather killed on the spot by the evil empire, who apparently kill just for sport, and have no real motivation.Acting so wooden and hollow, you'll feel like you're watching a play about hearding sheep, performed by the society of grave diggers, at your local town bowling alley on a Wednesday night during happy hour.If you like this film, please, please, for the love of humanity, do not procreate.","310 out of 427 found this helpful.

I'm guessing the same will happen to this due to the dark tone of it) Then release the Snyder Cut, which is not only longer, but darker, more violent, with profanity and sexual scenes that wouldn't pass at PG-13. These cuts end up being the definitive versions of the film, and vastly superior to the one the studio put out initially.I don't know why the studios don't trust in Zack Snyder's original vision, as he's proved time and time again that his vision is the better movie.Justice League was infinitely better than the Joss Whedon debacle that was initially released, as it restored whole deleted sub-plots. Got rid of the cheesy(and sometimes sleazy) humour, and introduced a whole new big bad, which due to the poor reception of the studio butchered cinema release, has just been left hanging.Batman Vs Superman explored more of the story as a whole, went deeper into each characters psyche, and introduced more story threads that would be picked up in Zack Snyder's Justice League.Watchmen, the directors cut actually gave justice to it's original inspiration. The seminal comic book Watchmen. It was long thought to be unfilmable, but Zack Snyder pulled it off, and apart from one very uncomfortable sex scene, should be up thee with the best comic book adaptations ever made.I'm guessing you've got my point by now, and I know this time it was a marketing ploy by Netflix to have the two different version. One that's more family friendly and one that's a Hard R rated, adults only version. But please reserve judgement on this duology of movies until you've seen what is Zack Snyder's original vision. The man is a masterful filmmaker when he's let off a leash and encouraged to do what he wants to do.

It has become increasingly clear that his films, consistently lack meaningful plot progression and substantial character arcs.The repetitive film sequences and copy and pasting, for me have become boring to watch. It sucks to watch his body of work, which fails to bring anything new to the table.The persistent use of slow-motion effects seems more a stylistic crutch than a narrative necessity. The excessive reliance on CGI and these slow-motion scenes, which add nothing of value, is confusing.Additionally, particularly the editing, was underwhelming. Glaring continuity errors in the scenes. I even saw the dull end of an axe slice a throat. These are not minor oversights; they significantly detract from the film's credibility.I had high hopes that 'Part Two' might redeem the cinematic tragedy of part one, but instead, it confirmed my reservations. This film feels more like a visual spectacle devoid of soul than a coherent narrative. Why make a story in 2 parts, 2 hours a piece, and prioritize flashy visuals over compelling storytelling?","221 out of 321 found this helpful.

It's a movie that has enjoyable aspects, cheesy aspects, cheap aspects and good/bad aspects. You might even call it a popcorn space opera film. I think there is progress after the first movie. The first movie was more messy. The fact that the movie takes place in a single location this time is also a factor in this.Seriously, the guy who made this movie loves slow motion, I understand a lot of people don't enjoy it that much. Frankly, it appeals to me because, when you are someone who consumes a lot of movies, too much rushing around the screen can tire you out.

Costumes, weapons, effects, etc. Are ok, even great. And the subject matter is also cool, but the truly meaningful side of things (like writing, characters, world building...) mostly sucks (or actually, it is kind of non-existent).First of all, I have some major gripes with some aspects of this universe, like for example:Why do they need to aim a battleship's cannon with hand wheels? Their engineers have built spaceships, walking tanks, laser guns, and whatever else, but they haven't been able to build electric motors, laser guidance or something, anything else?Military tactics are also pretty much non existent - the farmers who have never seen combat in any form learn to take down seasoned (presumably) warriors of the empire in a day or two. To be fair it is pretty easy to shoot people when they run in a tight pack towards you out in the open and over a tight bridge without anyone giving covering fire. They also have a huge tank but it never hits anyone although they are basically standing still (or moving in slow motion).But I guess all that and more doesn't matter as long as it looks cool.And btw, I still don't know why the one ship needs the grain of some backwater planet that apparently has only one tiny village that does all its farming by hand (like we used to like a hundred - or two hundred - years ago). Other than that one village (that has like 50 inhabitants, children included), the planet (or a moon, I guess) apparently has nothing else on it. They also manage to harvest all their grain in like a day or two (unbelievable feat). One would think that a huge honking battleship would have something better to do, llike blow the damn planet (moon) out of existentce and go home?Zack sure does like slow motion. The whole movie would probably be only an hour and a half long without all that. It reminds me a lot of Justice League's Snyder Cut which was also kind of agonizingly streched out (still much better than this though). Watching wheat harvesting in slo mo was a new experience for me.Acting is pretty much as good as it can be under the circumstances, meaning it is kind of non-existent. Green screen is clearly the heart and sould here and sadly that means that basically every bit of dialogue is delivered while the characters are standing, sitting or laying still. Environmental interaction? No such thing - god forbid anyone talks while they are moving around or doing stuff. We see a bunch of people cutting grain in slow motion but they have nothing to talk about while doing it, like idk, something that would make the characters actually be something other than lifelike props that couldn't be created digitally (I mean, they might as well be digital because then they could actually interact with these digital environments they are in). We get some very basic backstories for the main characters but all that is shows just as simple flashbacks with voiceovers, which is like the simplest way to tell any backstory (it would have been much better if the first movie would have told these backstories as actual storylines instead of this crap).These aren't problems only in these movies but what most streaming shows and movies more or less look like these days, especially scifi, fantasy and action. Characters are boring and stale, their relationships offer very little to care about and dialogue tends to be way too complicated and unrealistic. They are more like some wierd art pieces instead of stories about lives and experiences of any meaningful and identifiable substance. I don't even remember the names of most of the characters in these movies and I literally finished watching it like ten minutes ago. That is how much the characters meant to me. Anthony Hopkins does well as the voice of the James robot - but his character is actually CGI and can technically do stuff that people can't (not that he does much, but he could have).Now, it is pretty and watchable, I'm not saying that I hate it. But it is extremely poor in comaprison to what it could be (and especially should be, with a budget like this). Honestly, anyone who calls this a masterpiece, or a great war movie, either has a wild imagination that fills in all the gaps and covers up all the weirdness (or has a very simple mind). What this a masterpiece of, is slow motion action (with wheat harvesting and water bottle filling). If nothing else, it could probably could earn some kind of reward for that at least...","8 out of 11 found this helpful.

This sequel to ""Rebel Moon Part One: A Child of Fire"" is a bold and ambitious effort by Zack Snyder, which continues the epic space saga. While the first installment was met with mixed reviews, the sequel has managed to carve its niche by focusing on action, visual spectacle, and a streamlined narrative.To fully appreciate ""Rebel Moon Part Two: The Scargiver,"" it is essential to view it in the context of its predecessor. The narrative in Part One lays a solid foundation for the characters and the world-building. However, the sequel significantly benefits from this groundwork, providing a more cohesive and engaging story. The first part's slower pace and character development lay the groundwork for the action-packed, thrilling ride that Part Two offers. The combination of both parts creates a more complete and satisfying experience, allowing the audience to connect deeper with the characters and their journey.One of the most significant improvements in Part Two is the increased focus on action and visual spectacle. While Part One was criticized for its short fight scenes, Part Two delivers a more satisfying experience with its extensive, well-choreographed action sequences. The film's final act is a visual feast, featuring a spectacular battle sequence that showcases Zack Snyder's directorial prowess. The combination of stunning visuals, intense action, and a powerful score creates an immersive cinematic experience that is hard to forget.There's rumors of a ""Director's Cut"" edition with more than four hours of the entire ""Rebel Moon"", I think this extended version is expected to offer a more comprehensive and detailed look at the story, characters, and world-building. With Snyder's reputation for delivering epic, visually stunning films, a ""Director's Cut"" could potentially receive a more positive reception. The additional runtime would allow for more in-depth exploration of the characters' motivations, relationships, and the overall narrative, which could address some of the criticisms leveled at the first two parts.I think ""Rebel Moon Part Two: The Scargiver"" is a significant improvement over its predecessor, offering a more engaging and action-packed experience. The combination of both parts creates a more cohesive and satisfying narrative, while the focus on action and visual spectacle in Part Two makes for a thrilling cinematic experience. The potential of a ""Director's Cut"" edition could further enhance the film, providing a more comprehensive and detailed look at the story, characters, and world-building.While the ""Rebel Moon"" saga may not be perfect, it is undoubtedly an ambitious and visually stunning effort that deserves recognition for its unique blend of action, adventure, and science fiction.","103 out of 305 found this helpful.

Sure, there are movies that have screeners. As far as I'm aware, this was not the case with this movie.It looks like Zack has got a real hate train rolling against him. If people don't want him to keep producing things, best thing they can do is stop watching his material. I'm sure Netflix will get plenty of viewers of both installments of this flick. Will the ratings against the installments be enough for Netflix not to renew?Guess time will tell.I enjoyed both of these and would rate either better than Dune: Part One. Dune: Part Two might be slightly better, even though they veered from the book and I didn't really like the direction they took with Chani(also they left out a hell of a lot of background information, but was at least coherent this time).Anyway, this isn't a review about Dune. This segment of Rebel Moon was more fleshed out than the first. Also, while there was still slo-mo in the film, it wasn't as dominant as the first one. There was nothing groundbreaking in this film. It was just a good, action-packed Sci-fi. Most of the movie was action. You get more details about characters and what drives their anger/hatred.If you are wanting a thinking mans Sci-fi or mystery or thriller, then this might not be for you. In general I prefer that genre of Sci-fi over this type. It was still fairly enjoyable and I hope they do continue to flesh out the story with continued development of the franchise.","22 out of 54 found this helpful.

The novelization of Part 1 was great and it is based on the director´s cut. I hope that the final films won´t lose too much of the crazy after being pushed through the MPAA to secure an R. The most impressive aspect of this film is the Junkie XL 10/10 score. The least impressive aspect is the weird timeline of events and clearly missing information. The living god engines called Kali are only introduced in the full version of Part 1 for example but also play a role here. A scene only in Part 1´s director´s cut is for example presented to have happened during the 5 days of prep the village has in Part 2 making at all seem less credible. Because it actually isn´t! A main character will also die differently in the director's cut, something Snyder revealed in a post-screening Q&A so we are once again being dealt a VERY compromised vision on release. AotD too had timeline issues but that film rocked while Rebel Moon simply plays. Well, the second half more or less rocks. Admiral Noble was my favorite character in Part 1 but is outshone in Part 2 by General Titus. The dialogue flips between very strong and exposition.txt to name something split down the middle. Kurt Johnstad & Shay Hatten are no Chris Terrio or even David Goyer but their dialogue worked well through V. Castro´s filter in the novel. Some of the cheese is of course intentional. Both Snyder and Lucas (the PT specifically) pay homage to source material and styles that were already ancient before the scripting began.And the action and cinematography? Mostly first class and the Vfx are equally strong! The current version´s one proper action scene is 50 minutes long. 300 on spray paint and chrome! Known action scenes in flashbacks are cut to almost nothing outside of Kora´s tale. To think that the real film will have an even longer climax, other action bits with varied settings and more complex balls-to-the-wall choreography that will push the gore as hard as the MPAA will allow, with Euro comic sex scenes on top. That´s why Snyder will never be out of work. No one squeezes blood from a stone like him.I wonder how much these films truly cost. If Snyder indeed managed to make 2 three hour films with alternative material (!) for 2 two hour cuts on top for only 80-something million apiece then he needs to win a Producer´s Guild award. 2 Rebel 2 Moon: Bigger Longer Uncut drops both parts at once in late summer to fall 2024. If it´s as good as the book then we have an all-time cult classic on our hands and this second half is already good enough. Bring on the sequels and spin-offs but I will add that the Black Axe prequel comics didn´t grab me. Part 2 gets a B- for now. Part 1 gets a C but not for long, its novel is a B+.","24 out of 61 found this helpful.

The utter stupidity of this idea is matched by dialogue that normally comes from the mouths of poorly drawn animation of the 1970s.

The costumes and ship designs are cooler than most recent sci-fi outings, with a couple noteworthy exceptions. It's nice to see a passion project in this genre in this day and age. Zack Snyder clearly cares about this subject matter. This isn't the first time he's compromised with a studio on a final product (I can see why Netflix would want to air the PG-13 version first; rake in the views before you give people what was originally advertised as an R-rated film on their second viewing if they feel like tuning back in several months of subscription fees later), to the point where it's not so much compromise as methodology. Few filmmakers would go through the effort to make something so personal only to say ""Yeah, go ahead, piss all over my movie, take final cut, I'll release my version later when everyone's already decided that yours sucks."" Snyder is a fascinating visionary, a painter who likes to watch muscle-bound hulks punch robots in the face and spend 20 minutes on a harvest montage. What's really missing is the emotional punch that causes the audience to care about what happens on the screen; hopefully the R-rated cut will pack that punch. This is a failure with potential.","120 out of 211 found this helpful.

Part two on the other hand... Holy crap.It's like Zack Snyder just picked scenes and concepts that he liked from other films and threw them together with no regard as to how to make them flow. The ""character development"" is lazy and laughable to the extent that I've watched over 4 hours of these two films and I can remember the name of just one character. The amount of slow motion used is ludicrous, the premise of the situation (a village supplying an amount of grain so small that it wouldn't feed the crew collecting it for more than 3 days) is a joke and there are so many other irritatingly stupid and questionable details to annoy you that you'll be glad when it's over.

The shots here is the best thing of the movie, it speak good visual storytelling and I feel that dramatic tense throughout the movie. My favorite is Jimmy's scene, the visual is just epic. The CGI is very cool too, salute to the team.The choreography, sometimes I think they're cool, sometimes I feel like they're dumb.Zack Snyder being Zack Snyder as usual, the slow motion effect is presence and I think this time is kind of satisfying. I even enjoyed the harvesting scene that many people complained, I see it like the character bonding to the everyday activity of the villagers.What I disappointed on this movie is the whole story, theme, and character's motives is not justified for the big fight and low reward. It's making the same mistake as the first part.The main characters on the group still feels like a stranger meddling with someone else's business, even with all talk about their sad past. Talk big and all muscle and violence.Feel's like it's lazy writing, because they dump the exposition again and again. It makes me feel like I didn't care anymore about it.It's either a bad writing and focusing on cool content or it's just a bad editing because I suspect there are many things that are edited out of the movie because it is left many things feel like rushed.We know there going to be a continuation, maybe they prepared the unsaid story for the next movie. If it is, I think it's a bad decision. They introduced so many things at once and it's risking the movie to fail.I hope for the next movie, they going to give us a better story.

Speed it up to normal and you probably condense it into 2 thirds the run time if not more! Seriously though, I feel the point of slow mo is to emphasis a point, create an emotion... if you do them every freaking time My Synder they loose any meaning and are just annoying!The good stuff. I like the world. The design is cool, if very video gamey (40k, Star Craft, Ridick, Halo you name it!) But it works. I love the premise, the mercenaries vs ridiculous odds never tires with me. I like some of the actors. The effects are decent enough.The rest... the dialogue makes George Lucas look like Shakespeare! The 'acting' is poor as there is little to work with. The script is all over the place. The beauty of 7 Samurai and Magnificent 7 is that the characters did not need the whole backstop thing. James Colburn, he was the hardened merc, cold blooded and good with knives. You got that the scene you met him. DONE! Steve McQueen, quick, cool, ladies man kind off. Again, established in the first scene. 2 movies in and I barely see these guys as characters, just bland with back stories which do NOTHING! The action is all slowed down to mostly a bore. The story makes no sense (please tell me how a ship can survive in deep space for so long, but a 100 bags full of grain cannot under and circumstances be blown up?) I wanted this to be good, a fresh franchise which could enjoy. Even some dumb fun. This is not fun, and times where you think it might redeem itself, it throws it away again in the next scene. Give me Roger Corman's 'Battle Beyond the Stars' any day over this, it may be cheese-tastic crap, but it knows how to have some fun!","8 out of 10 found this helpful.

Yes there is room for improvement for sure and at times the battles are a bit unrealistic, but we're in a fantasy world anyway. View this as fiction, enjoy the buildup and the stories of bravery. Most battles are quite epic and the special effects are on point. I could definitely recommend Rebel Moon Part Two and hopefully we will get some more with some nessecary improvements here and there. To the storyline, character building and a bit less predictable. I see a lot of potential for more sequels, so who knows this will become a new franchise.

Reports that should send shivers down the spine of anyone that appreciates feature films of quality if they have any validity.The unwanted follow-on from last December's non-event that ended up being the much hyped and big budgeted Netflix original Rebel Moon - Part One: A Child of Fire, The Scargiver somehow manages to be much worse than its terrible forefather making one truly question if Snyder will ever be able to get back to the quality of films he use to deliver with the likes of Dawn of the Dead, Watchmen and 300.Proclaimed to be Netflix's answer to the Star Wars cinematic universe, Rebel Moon has the bones of what might be an interesting and entertaining feature film world but as was the case with Part One, Scargiver is devoid of any spark or imagination to make it worth your time with one even beginning to wonder whether or not Snyder just wanted to showcase the joys of harvesting with most of Scargiver's first 30 - 40 minutes mostly made up of slow-motion crop work, making one beg for the end of the slow torture that if removed would have made this two hour ""event"" more like a 30 minute addition to the first outing.Doing very little that justifies the decision to cut the two Rebel Moon films into separate parts, Scargiver repeats all the same mistakes as Snyder's first offering as we once more follow Sofia Boutella's Kora and her merry band of freedom fighters protecting some grain from Ed Skrein's seemingly inept Atticus Noble, promising an epic Lord of the Rings like siege battle that instead becomes merely a procession of loud noises and pedestrian fight segments that are welcomed in by one of the years most cringe-worthy scenes that acts like an amateur hour Dungeons and Dragons night where Kora and her comrades tell each other their backstories.There's not a single character here we can really get behind, perhaps other than Anthony Hopkins woods loving robot Jimmy, there's no performance that appears to be having any fun in the whole po-faced event and the action space that Synder once owned early in his career has here become a sad self-parody of his best works that would be at home in the bargain basement bin offerings of long gone Blockbuster Video stores.In many ways The Scargiver is both the worst example of Netflix's big-budget failures and original IP's that every now and then strike gold but for the most part flop like this and also the sad state of Snyder's current career that looks like its destined to be stuck in the doldrums for the long-haul from here on out.While there's no doubt the Rebel Moon films were not supposed to re-write the rulebook and were designed with entertainment in mind, there's zero excuse for a film to be as bland and painful to endure as The Scargiver is making it an undeniable disaster and a new career low for a filmmaker who once promised to be one of the most enjoyable blockbuster voices in Hollywood.Final Say -If you thought Rebel Moon: Part One was bad you haven't seen anything yet! A slow-motion filled train wreck whose flying wheat is as interesting as its one-dimensional characters and yawn-inducing action scenes, Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver gives us very little to enjoyable no matter where you look.1/2 a backstory powwow out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)","22 out of 34 found this helpful.

Takes the brilliant concept of Spaceballs: The Breakfast Cereal and runs with it. The best film of its kind since the sci-fi yeast farming saga Gentlemen Broncos. Probably the best wheat-farming cinematography ever put to screen. The endless shots of scythes slashing through the air in slow motion evoke the mortality of man and the great circle of wheaty life. And they make a man hunger for a good hearty breakfast. Beautiful stalks of golden deliciousness swaying in the space-winds and lens flares. And the shots of the grains gracefully flying through the air are a breakfast cereal lover's dream come true. Casting Wil Wheaton (and cameos from the band Wheatus) as the wheat was a stroke of genius, and he should definitely be considered for the academy award. Truly life-changing and tasty. During this film I drank 8 tall cans of German Weissbeer in celebration of its wheaty glory. My only question is, how do the bad guys know what tasty wheat tastes like? Maybe what they think tasty wheat tastes like actually tastes like oatmeal or tuna fish? Either way we all need more whole grains in our diets, and this film advertises this health benefit to great effect. I've since bought 10 bulk cases of Shredded Wheat and now it and wheat beer is all I consume.","7 out of 9 found this helpful.

Also, the subject of writing his films is the worst thing he has done in his artistic career. Martin Scorsese, in his most famous films, did not write them, but rather played the role of director in them, He must realize that he will not become like Christopher Nolan in writing or directing, and he will not live up to Trentino's position in terms of writing.In the end, I hope that Zach knows well that the field of writing is not destined for him and that he is satisfied with the subject of directing.

Your only problem is that it happens too quickly. If only somebody would film it in sloooooooooooooooooooowwwww moooooooooootiooooooooooooon.* You feel that lens flares are criminally underused in science fiction movies. You just can't get enough of them. You don't really care to look at anything that isn't a lens flare.* You like gigantic battle scenes where the protagonists are covered in plot armor -- but you *particularly* like it when those battles obligingly pause for the characters to make shmaltzy inspirational monologues.In all seriousness, these were a truly wretched couple of movies. I think the real tragedy of them is that there might have been something better, or at least more interesting, lurking deep inside the production process. The way that the spaceships emerge from giant hyperspace vaginas, or that the dreadnaught is inexplicably powered by a gigantic head apparently fellating a bed of coal -- and heck, the fact that the dreadnaughts are coal-powered, sweaty coal-shovelers and all -- suggests some absolutely bonkers, Zardoz-level conceptual weirdness at the heart of these films' conception. I really wish they'd leaned into that, rather than focusing on slow-mo tableaus of falling wheat and lens flares, and cringey monologues from paper-thin characters. I don't know if that would have ever made it _good_, but at least it could have been more interesting.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

The heroes are heroes and the villains are villains, so don't expect any twists and turns. It's also a fairly boring story to be honest, and the harvest part seemed to drag on for far too long.

The script is a disaster, feeling like it belongs in the era of ""Idiocracy"" with its complete lack of logic and incessant nonsense that seems to bother no one.From the get-go, with the lengthy scythe reaping of grain, I found myself wondering whether this was a film or an attempt to hypnotize the viewer. Worse still are the chaotic fight scenes where heroes waste ammunition shooting at each other from close range and missing, reminiscent of the worst clichés from ""Star Wars"" - but without any charm. Really, continuously charging headlong into machine gun fire is true torture.Another issue is the pacing of the narrative. ""Rebel Moon"" stubbornly turns every potentially exciting moment into a test of the viewer's patience. The action slows are so predictable and artificial that instead of building tension, they merely prompt yawns.In summary, ""Rebel Moon"" could have been a cinematic hit if only someone had devoted more time to refining the script instead of allocating all resources to special effects. It's a production that, despite a dazzling facade, is internally empty and irritatingly absurd. For fans of special effects who can overlook the lack of any narrative coherence, it might be tolerable, but for the rest, it's nothing more than a frustrating waste of potential.","35 out of 66 found this helpful.

It says something about a movie when already on 15th minute stops being watchable..
My honest opinion: The scene with the royal family assassination is a copy paste Ceasar movie scene, only very bad one, the 7 samurais in Star Wars movies, the read servants and Bene Gesserit Sisterhood cheap knockoff (Dune), the Vikings rip off in harvesting village- and somehow he managed to ""get inspired"" by the Witcher the origin story and Star Trek strange new worlds (there's probably much more but it was too painful to watch)
There's this idea of The rebel moon being a new universe, but the reality is it is a very bad mashup of all old well known and respected universes (movies) Music is not corresponding, scenes are forced and very badly organised, dialogues seem written by kindergarten kids exercise, slow motion is exaggerated and unnecessary in 99%, the story is unrelatable and inconsistent (ST strange new worlds CAN have this jump from highly developed planet to one from Stone Age BECAUSE THEY ARE JUST DISCOVERING THEM, it doesn't work if they're the part of the same empire !) the acting is very sadly bad, surprisingly so for the quality actors. I still haven't finished the movie, cannot convince myself on torture.

Sure, it's not perfect: a couple of clunky maneuvers in fight scenes here and there; a handful of scenes that could've been acted with more emotion; and certain characters could've benefitted from more development. But for all of the aforementioned flaws, there are double the successes. The story is better fleshed out than a fair amount of other sci-fi action flicks; the fight scenes are overall pretty good; the acting in the majority of the film was good; and the graphics quality is really strong. This movie got me emotionally invested in the story and the characters: I found myself rooting for the protagonists and some of the supporting characters, and hating the antagonists. If the movie elicits an emotional response in me, it's doing something right. This isn't gonna win any awards, but it's not nearly as bad as some reviews would lead you to believe. I, for one, honestly liked it and am looking forward to the next installment (hopefully we get another installment). Give it a shot and decide for yourself.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

This isn't a 4 hr story broken into two films... it's a mediocre story told twice, under the guise of being two parts. Part Two is quite literally nothing more than a different way to tell Part One. (A la ChatGPT's second generation for the same prompts - ya get the same thing, just slightly different)Part two serves no purpose. It just retells part one for the most part... mixing in FAR too much harvesting, grain production and literally retelling character backstories which were told in Part One. (WTF???).Just like part one.. this is a mix of 7 Samurai (aka Magnificent 7) and Star Wars.. but oddly the two worlds never actually intertwine. Space ships faster than the speed of light.. but still need a sickle and scythe to harvest??? A sentient robot, or a hologram communication device, but no simple machines to sort and store grain.. m'kay. Looooooong slow motion flashbacks to re-establish characters that were already established in part one.I quite honestly don't understand anyone that would read this script and think it's worth millions. But it could possibly be Snyder getting one over on Netflix.. Netflix pays to have it made, Snyder ultimately delivers trash (Like most of his films).This is bad... on par with Sy-Fy/Aslym film writing. ""Rebelgeddon!"" .. ""Rebel Moonado!"" --- Nonsensical, full of plot holes and pointless, poorly acted, wan-a-be-dramatic character building regarding cardboard cutout characters you've seen in any one a thousand films over the past 40 years. But at least Asylum knows they are making ""schlock"". Snyder thinks he's making gold apparently..... but it's pyrite in reality, looks shiny, but is worthless.Apparently grain/wheat only grows on ONE planet in the entire universe..... And this huge high-tech multi-planetary army can't figure out how to feed itself unless they conquer a bunch of farmers with shovels and rakes???So much more, but I'm avoiding actual spoilers.VERY typical Snyder... pointless, nonsensical plot holes, and focusing on CGI far, far, FAR more than any story.---- PASS -------","13 out of 21 found this helpful.

Well ladies and germs, it somehow got worse.I used to be a Snyder fan. I really enjoy 300 and Watchmen, and I think Man of Steel is a very underrated superhero movie. I even appreciate BvS in spite of its clear flaws, and I like The Snyder Cut well enough (though on a recent rewatch it didn't hold up as well as the first viewing). This, and part 1 before it, seriously make me question if I can get excited for a Snyder film again.Some positives to start with, there are some cool visuals (SOME, we'll come back to that), I like the design of the robot character and his entrance to the fight is pretty cool, and the space shots have a pretty sweet look to them. There are also a few cool fight moments scattered about amongst the chaos.Now, that aside, there really isn't much worth your time in this thing. To start with, and honestly kinda the most disappointing for a Snyder flick, I really don't care for the visuals. The CGI is fine, I wouldn't consider it glaringly bad really, but the film is unpleasant to look at most of the time. I respect using some old and dirty lenses, but Snyder's insistance on using them wide open the whole time (and in this case on a sensor way bigger than they were built for) just creates a muddy and mushy look with so much distortion. Beyond that the costumes and sets aren't terribly impressive either, they're perfectly fine, but not super impressive, and the bland color grade doesn't help either.The action as well is pretty lackluster. Constant (like bordering on parody level) slow mo, and when it's not that it's just poorly choreographed and choppy. So many times that someone without a gun stands in front of multiple armed attackers and not a shot is fired at them.I won't talk much crap on the actors, cause they're doing their best with arguably the weakest aspect of the film, the script. The dialogue (little that there is) is bland at best, laughable at worst. About the time that the main characters all sat around a table giving their DnD character introductions for like 10 minutes straight I knew we were in for a world of hurt.I really could go on and on about all the nonsense (like this ship that can travel through portals being powered by coal in a Titanic like engine room), but really the simplest way I can describe this film is that it feels like a movie made by a 12 yr old boy who's trying to make it not feel like a movie made by a 12 yr old boy. It's 2 (or 4 as a whole) hours or Snyder trying so hard to be cool that it just ends up over the top and goofy as hell.Maybe the director's cuts will improve them, I don't really care and at this point I'm sick of him making us all watch marginally better director's cuts to make up for appalling theatrical (if this can be called that on a straight to streaming movie) releases.","15 out of 25 found this helpful.

It's a Snyder film, you should know what to expect. It's gonna look great, be action packed, contain slow-mo, and veer towards style over substance. It delivers on all counts. These are the components he uses every time, it ain't gonna change. If you expect anything else you should know better, that's YOUR fail, not Snyder's (unless he came over to your gaff and made you watch the film at gun point). It's a solid, entertaining two hours and a decent way to relax your way through an evening. 7.5 outta 10 rounded up to 8 for IMDBNow let's discuss the one star reviewers and 'worst film of all time, burn him at the stake, cut off his manhood, ban him from ever using a camera again' clowns who need to get a grip. I'm no Snyder fanboy. I will say that visually I do think he's a cut above the pack, but also think in other aspects he's definitely lacking. What I am a fan of though, is entertainment. Not every piece of film or TV has to make complete logical sense, or be grounded in absolute realism. Breaking down and critiquing the logic in an ACTION sci-fi film makes no sense. We are not talking about hard sci-fi here. This is no 'Arrival' or 'Interstellar' and neither does it claim to be. Stop being a killjoy and remember what it was like to have fun watching a film again. If you can't do that, then at least remember that if you see Snyder's name attached to something that you should know what to expect and if you don't want that, to give it a miss.Lastly, let's stop pretending like Star Wars has more than two great movies (one of these is a prequel, which I'll leave unnamed just to annoy the worst breed of fanboy), and two great seasons of TV. Everything else is literally the same quality as the two parts of Rebel Moon, or considerably worse. I would watch this over ANY of the sequel trilogy any day.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

It's a film of two halves as it spends the first half focusing on slow motion farming instead of character development which really hinders the stakes of the final battle. However, that second half is just an hour long battle so it's worth it overall.Sofia Boutella is still able to give Kora a level of depth that exceeds what's on the page. Djimon Hounsou gets so much more to do and the added depth that he, Bae Doona and Staz Nair get is welcome even if it still isn't enough. Ed Skrein might be the best though with his thoroughly evil performance.Zack Snyder's direction remains as visually stylish as ever. He's at his strongest in the second half when the focus is on making cool action scenes with his trademark slow motion but the use of that is really beginning to border on self parody. Flaws and all, it's still nice to see a Netflix blockbuster that feels like it was made by a human more than an algorithm.When it was first announced that both parts were made for around $160 million it sounded so impressive and it still is but this one being set almost exclusively on the one farm makes this universe feel real small. Tom Holkenborg's score has the required bombast and sincerity whilst coming dangerously close to copying his work on Batman V Superman.","12 out of 47 found this helpful.

Literal slo-mo.And the car is a clown car... and it's on a bridge... and a bridge is falling down... into a septic tank.I like to imagine Zack Snyder typing this movie by himself on a most expensive MacBook known to man, thinking how much of a genius he is. A true wordsmith. Nonchalant smile and a self asserting nod to himself and his level of humble supremacy in the smarts department.Dialog is vapid and cringe. Snyder thinks his writing rivals Shakespeare. It does not.It rivals, barely, a five year old child that has a faintest understanding that written words exist. Email spam is better written than this.Action is empty, not interesting and without stakes, in short - boring. Music is hilariously serious and without merit.Plot is embarasingly stupid. Acting is either bad or .. well, worse. Characters are wasted, villain is the same dude as in the first movie, but somehow... less. Oh, lord, oh no. I'm having flashbacks to the endless slo-mo harvesting scene.Also, she cuts her hair to look like in the olden days of her glory. Dude shaves, looks like a goober, promptly exits the ""franchise"".Visually unimpressive, yet expensive.I thought ""telling and not showing"" is bad, but somehow Zack Snyder managed to make ""show and tell and narate it at the same time"", and it's worse.Only thing that can challenge this netflix trash is, well, a first Rebel Moon movie.Zack Snyder is truly and most probably the worst overpaid director at this moment. Everybody says he should do photography in a movie, not direct or write.

The plot was simple and that's enough I just enjoyed the ride and I felt the characters pain, hope, drive for peace from war and find a place called home.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Absolutely not.I went in to these movies not expecting too much but I did enjoy them. The acting was okay. I thought that Sofia Boutella and Djimon Hounsou did a great job with the script they were given. The special effects were astounding and the finale was awesome. Yes, the slow motion could have been toned down a bit, but it wasn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be.So when I see ratings for terrible, terrible movies like Icyclone, with it's photoshop effects getting higher scores then Rebel Moon Part 1 and 2... something's going on.It's the haters!!!

But for right now...please...do not hire Zack Snyder until he gets himself straightened out.Zack Snyder has become a parody of himself. There is way too much slo-mo used in the action scenes. I guess there are some wide CGI shots that look passable even for a Netflix release. But even after a while, the action scenes get boring fast. Thank god this was only a two hour movie.The dialogue is trying so hard to be serious and meaningful that it comes across as shallow and pretentious. Almost every line is some epic speech or flowery claptrap that wants to be cool or memorable that it just goes in one ear and out the other.The robot (voiced by Anthony Hopkins) is the one likable character while the villain (a wildly over-the-top Ed Skrein) gives the most entertaining performance. Djimon Hounsou tries to add some resemblance of gravitas with his performance. But even he gets one-note after a while. This movie made Djimon Hounsou boring. Shame on Zack Snyder.Sofia Boutella in supporting roles can be a captivating screen presence. But I'm afraid she is not yet leading lady material. Her romantic scenes with an embarrassed looking Michael Huisman are pretty dreadful. And even that turned out to be a waste of time.I don't fancy myself as someone that even dislikes Zack Snyder in general. I liked some of his work. I liked Dawn of the Dead, 300, and I actually really enjoyed Man of Steel.But he needs to hire better writers and to stop taking himself so damn seriously. Just have some fun for once.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

I had fun watching it. The action was mostly on point but sometimes quite overloaded with effects.The bad part of it is the background of the characters story. It felt overrushed and not quite understandable. The reason why the main character acted like it did was nowhere in the near of clear because it just was explained in maybe two lines of text. On the other hand, the backstory of the general gave me chills.Overall an enjoyable Zack Snyder Movie. It will not be so easily forgotten.

The answer to that hope was a hard no!There were so many terrible elements to the movie it's hard to focus. As I was watching all I could think was, did AI generate this script? It was so painfully predictable and cliche. Like the Wish (or Temu?) version of Star Wars mixed with every other SciFi movie of the past 30 years. There's literally a death star explosion scene with a character saying ""you may fire at will"" just as the ship explodes! Like WTF?The acting is atrocious as well. The pauses between lines gives the audience time to correctly guess what's coming next, the emotion is wildly superficial (line delivery is comically dull), and 90% of the characters just have blank stares most of the movie.Seriously, I could rip on this trash heap all day but I can summarize by simply saying, avoid this one. There isn't even campy charm to it, it's just a waste of time and of course they leave it open for a third movie, ugh. I apologize for any typos in this review, I promise I dedicated more time to writing this than the writers of this movie spent on the script.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

It certainly is not what I would call great but it reaches an overall ok/enjoyable and there are aspects I really liked. The visuals are stunning yet overblown - like in 300 or in an Anime. But once you accept that, it is fun to watch. Too much slow-mo for my taste, but it's Snyder. The style is coherent and well designed - I enjoyed the overall looks. The acting had huge variations. Some great moments, some really bad ones. I liked the interpretation of the 7 Samurai theme but the characters did not get the development they would have needed. And I definitely would have chosen a different character to die in battle. But overall my inner scifi-geek had a good time in front of the screen.

It's Snyder's movie with all of its bells and whistles. Will you get great acting? No. Will you get dramatic plot and storytelling? No. Will you get great action and stunning old-school visuals with tons of bullet time? Hell yes. Tons of it.The plot is not the greatest, far from it. It's not Dune. It doesn't have well thought out lore as Lucasfilm's Star Wars. And to be honest, I find it kind of refreshing. A movie you won't remember for anything but amazing CGI and great fight scenes. I'm not expecting anything else from Zack's movies.People may compare it to Star Wars, and to be quite honest, I was much less insulted by Rebel Moon 1 and 2 than new trilogy under Disney's all-seeing eye.RM is its own thing. A great, ridiculously high budget B-tier thing. Its plot is cohesive so far (at least that little bit of plot that's hiding there), even though a little bit too easy to digest for my taste.In my opinion (for which you can downvote me all the way down), Rebel Moon franchise is now amongst my top 10 action focused scifi franchises. Because I simply like what it is, and it doesn't give me any space to dislike it for what it isn't. That's how simple this movie is.If I should compare it to something from real life scenario, Rebel Moon is like an A-class hooker. It's beautiful, it's not the smartest and you won't find there the meaning of life or your next wife. You visit it just for visually stunning fun that you might regret visiting 2 days after you're done with it.

It is better, although it still has its problems.The last half of the film is a spectacular battle, which certainly helps. Zack Snyder delivers destruction and pyrotechnics on an immense scale and we all know that he can manage stylish action with aplomb. So much so that you forgive the film for lapses in common sense and coherency.Unfortunately the first half of the film is less assured. An attempt is made to make us care for the village community our heroes are striving to protect. The most obvious example is an extended community harvest scene on which much care has been lavished, but it just doesn't work, perhaps because it does not ""fit"" within the overall narrative and so feels like it's forced in to the story.Also, an effort is made to round out the characters of the band of heroes, but with a similar lack of success. Nevertheless Sofia Boutella, Djimon Housou and Bae Doona manage to bring their characters to some sort of life, without much help from the script or the director. The other heroes could almost disappear from the screen.So the final battle is the key. Enjoy that and you forgive so much else. I did anyway.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Credit where its due some of the scenes were cool looking but i was so uninterest I didn't really care.No hate to the actors because they were all brilliant but the characters in this film were despicable. They were all diabolical. Literally all the development we get on the characters is a conversation where each character takes turns explaining their backstories. Can you get any lazier than that???? As a result whenever there was a character death I didn't really care because I'd literally no idea who the character was.One of the worst 2 hours ever.

The Scargiver takes all of the world building from the first, adds significantly more to the story and characters, and tops it off with an epic battle sequence.Everything great about the original is continued here. The beautiful visuals, amazing music and goosebump-inducing slow-motion shots. It's more Snyder being Snyder, and I'm nowhere close to being sick of it. For me, it's delicious.The part that stands out the most is how ridiculously invested I was in the wellbeing of the characters and the outcome of the story. I was on the edge of my seat, legitimately nervous and worried. And to make it even more impactful, this movie is emotionally powerful. It gave me the feels more than once.In conclusion, The Scargiver is highly entertaining, awesome, intense and fun.(1 viewing, 4/19/2024)","123 out of 347 found this helpful.

The film's second half is an exhilarating rollercoaster ride of action, drama, and breathtaking special effects that make it a must-watch for fans of the genre.While the movie delivers an enthralling second act, the first hour might test the patience of some viewers, as it seems to drag on with a somewhat slow pace. However, once the story gains momentum, it becomes an unforgettable cinematic experience. The character development and world-building are commendable, but the initial sluggishness detracts from what could have been a consistently engaging narrative.Nevertheless, Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver ultimately triumphs with its impressive visuals, compelling storyline, and thrilling action sequences. It's a worthy addition to the sci-fi genre, providing enough excitement and intrigue to satisfy even the most discerning fans.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

Sure, the costumes and spaceships look cool, but it's missing that emotional punch that makes you care about what's happening on screen. Dull, repetitive, generic, uneventful. Just another action flick and moneygrab scifi. Not realistic, not captivating, like watching a fireworks show without anything you'd ever care about.

It's a sci fi action inspired by dozens of other movies/games and best to describe it is: Seven Samurai mixed with pace opera. It's a ton of fun and the only reason I am giving this a 6/10 (gave the first one a 7) is the cringey dramatic non sense, reminded me of Return of the King with all the crying. It's taking itself too seriousy amidst all the fun action and explosions. Zack Snyder is definitely working on the next one and I will be there to watch it and so will you and others. They'll hate it but it will still be the nr. 1 movie on Netflix just like this one and the first one.

""Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver!, however, is a predictable and boring adventure that follows the Netflix's standard (one black warrior, one Asian warrior, one gay warrior, a powerful - but this time, not beautiful that looks like an androgynous man - lead woman).

A must-watch for any fan of the genre!","15 out of 33 found this helpful.

I did, mind, like seeing the battles commence, both in terms of action and effects.Sofia Boutella is enjoyable once more, but Ed Skrein isn't as interesting this time around; I would've preferred a new villain for this one, to be honest. Djimon Hounsou does have more to work with on this occasion though, which is only a positive thing. Bae Doo-na has a few nice moments, even if she is underused for the majority.These movies work for me, what can I say? Kinda mad, however, that they're seemingly planning to make six of these in total... a bit much, even for someone that likes these opening two.

Like there's no difference between this series and the entire Riddick franchise aesthetically (except maybe for the amount of slow motion lol, and more modern CGI too), whereas Villeneuve's Dune creates its own style with some ""Lawrence of Arabia"" polishing. There is almost no stake at all, thanks to the plot armor that amplifies the fighting prowess of the good guys (even though most of them are not built for that) while at the same time, dumbs down the supposedly well trained bad guys (tch, classic). Snyder is said to have a plan for at least 6 movies of this series, but the overall first two movies are enough for me to move on and demand Denis Villeneuve to give me Dune Messiah already.7.5/10.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The sequel, much like the first, is a hastily assembled narrative that struggles to stitch together its plot points into a coherent tapestry.Where the film does manage to shine, albeit briefly, is in its action sequences. These moments of adrenaline are choreographed with a finesse that almost makes you forget the story's shortcomings. Almost.It's perplexing that the studio greenlit a sequel given the lukewarm reception of the original. Yet, here we are, and it seems the franchise is set to continue its trajectory with another follow-up. One can't help but wonder if the decision-makers are too deep in the franchise to course-correct.In conclusion, this sequel is a missed opportunity to redeem the series. It's a film that will likely be watched out of loyalty or curiosity, but it won't be remembered for its artistic merit.","21 out of 40 found this helpful.

I even rewatched A Child of Fire to assure myself I still like it. And I do, which I can also say the same about Part Two.It's a direct continuation of Part One, picking up from where it ended. As a standalone film of course it won't make anyone go ""wow I just watched a really decently fun movie"". It's pretty much all action because that's what A Child of Fire led to. Hard to squeeze in some nice scenery shots on a battlefield, that's why it is lacking those compared to the prequel, understandably.Another thing this lacks are further exploration of the Rebel Moon world and characters development. I thought we'd get those in sequel if not in the first part. Because of it the movie feels blank. A no-brainer, just science fiction fighting.I'm not even gonna bother watching the making of (Creating a Universe: The Making of Rebel Moon), because they haven't created anything out of ordinary (hopefully YET) to see a documentary about it.Whole movie (both parts) feels like it's too long and also too short to get a sense of development and depth in many parts of new Zack Snyder's world.Giving it a 3/5 but only as a continuation of Part One: A Child of Fire. Alone it's surely a lower ranking but still fun.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The 300 meets Star Wars. The bad guys are truly bad and the good guys battle hard and struggle to triumph over evil.One special effect that I really enjoyed from Part One, which continued into Part Two, the close up of the blasters as the director uses slowmo type of bullet-time, whereby you can see the lava laser bolt with the red glow of the round leaving the chamber and traveling away from the blaster. There is blowback sufficient to provide excellent suspended disbelief that blasters are actually being fired and exist.The light swords appear to be lava for red lighted weapons and ice for blue lighted weapons and made of glass. It is like a lightsaber but different, ice/lava sabre, with the great illusion of actually penetrating bodies during combat.""Green screen"" is well executed in this production. There is definitely no ""low budget"" feeling at all.I recommend this movie for its combat scenes, pyrotechnics, cinematography, and visual FX!Pay attention during the slow scenes as you may lose the overall perspective.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Part Two is an improvement in that we learn more about our merry band of ""Seven Samurai"", as they share their formative background stories. The upshot is that these previously one-dimensional characters are now two-dimensional. In addition, I think Part Two is less blatantly derivative. This may sound like faint praise, but I honestly appreciated the improvement, and some credit is due. However, the characters in these films are merely there to provide sufficient story context for a bunch of CGI.The visuals are good, just like in Part One, but with more explosions. The defensive prep of the village was well done. It's nice to see people use their brains and come up with a plausible strategy (kind of rare in movies). So more credit is due.I enjoyed this movie; I think it rates 6.5 stars on that basis. However, I'm deducting a half-star for semi-predictability. That makes six (6) stars total.PS The lack of powered (or automated) farming tools (aside from a stake-bed hover-platform) is puzzling. It's supposed to show some pseudo-Amish quality-of-primitive-life, but anyone who has actually done that kind of work will tell you (better) TOOLS give you quality of life. Granted, they had a mill, but carefully avoided showing the power source (hmm). Anyone who thinks subsistence farming is ""fun"" is delusional; mechanized agriculture is responsible and necessary for modern (middle-class) life; without it you have a neo-feudal society at best (which GRANTED is what they're depicting, but better tools would be in EVERYONE'S best interest, and are clearly feasible in a society that can make dreadnoughts, sentient/sapient robots, and hover-boards).","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

While some of his works showcase impressive visuals, others fall flat due to repetitive elements and weak narratives. For instance, ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" received criticism for its convoluted plot and lackluster character development. The film's action sequences, while visually striking, often lacked coherence in choreography, leading to disjointed fight scenes that failed to engage viewers effectively.Another example from Snyder's repertoire is ""Sucker Punch,"" which suffered from a disjointed storyline and overreliance on stylized visuals at the expense of coherent storytelling. The film's attempts at blending fantasy elements with real-world drama resulted in a muddled narrative that left audiences perplexed rather than immersed.Moving beyond Snyder's films, there are numerous instances in the realm of Netflix originals where budget constraints have led to subpar productions. One such example is the series ""Iron Fist,"" which faced criticism for its lackluster fight choreography and uninspired cinematography. The show's action sequences often felt staged and lacked the dynamic energy expected from a martial arts-based storyline.Additionally, Netflix's ""Death Note"" adaptation received backlash for its departure from the original source material, resulting in a weak storyline that failed to capture the essence of the beloved manga and anime series. The film's pacing issues and underdeveloped characters further contributed to its overall negative reception.In terms of cinematography, Netflix's ""The Ridiculous 6"" is another example of a poorly executed production. The film's visual style and editing choices were often jarring, detracting from the viewing experience and highlighting the limitations of its budget.Overall, while Zack Snyder has delivered visually impressive moments in some of his works, the lack of cohesive storytelling and effective choreography has been a recurring issue. Similarly, budget constraints have led to shortcomings in various Netflix originals, highlighting the challenges faced in balancing visual spectacle with narrative depth and technical execution.","22 out of 45 found this helpful.

Probably not! That's what the author thinks: he talks about freedom, home, family, love. He says it's worth fighting for!

Thus the ruler of the empire is taking his dreadnot starcruiser to this village even though he could easily travel at lightspeed around the entire universe..

Some of the choices for providing backstory is just cringe, like ""hey, let's go round the table and tell our life stories"".A lot of the added scenes to make it look ""cool"" are even more cringe, lite someone running head first into a shower of bullets (lasers really) and then tosses an enemy over his shoulder... Said tossing over the shoulder leaves all hundreds of charging enemies so stunned that they forget to fire any more...The number of slow-mo scenes makes this movie about 40 minutes longer that it would have been without them.Conveniently for our hero's fighting with swords, when the enemies show up, they too have forgotten all rifles and firearms and come bearing swords too...There's a scene for several minutes about riding an elevator while looking fierce by wrapping a sword handle that must go to the history for being the most ridiculous time filler ever.I also question a lot of the logic, I mean if you are dressed as an enemy soldier to blend in but then you decide to ditch all of that advantage to be able to instead walk the hallways in a white top, really sticking out like a sore thumb to the enemies... It probably looks better to reveal some skin and shiny muscles, but come on!So, yes, a lot of bad choices form the director and waaaay too much effort to try and spice the scenes up, and unnecessarily I might add.The actors are doing a good job, but the script is too weak, too little plot and ""finess"" to be able to carry two plus hours.It's like they had only like one hour twenty minutes of good movie, but Netflix had ordered at least 2 hours so they had to add a lot of extra (=cringe) scenes and a ton of slow-mo to boot to stretch it out.Over all it's a good and viewable story, and I am actually looking forward to the third movie (because there will be one, trust me!) but I really, really, hope that they come up with some better storytelling and some more character development as I now have a hard tie rooting for the good guys...","0 out of 8 found this helpful.

The different thing is very bad version. As an action movie it is okay, but when we want to enjoy good story then I consider it as B-.When I read from some articles, the story is ment to be an adaptation of Kurosawa's 7 Samurai and Star Wars. I should say yes, however Snyder failed to develop the story. Snyder imagination to make the audience able to sit for 2 hours is totally wrong. A very boring movie. Big budget one but feels like as if a very cheap movie.The special effects are average with present technology. Can't really help to reach certain 'wow effect' as I expected before.","11 out of 20 found this helpful.

No masterpiece, for sure. However, let it flow and relax while watching. If you miss a dialog or scene, it's uncritical, and you won't be more lost than watching it end 2 end.I'm always wondering if everyone involved doesn't see the story gaps or doesn't care. Maybe it's related to our brain's inability to follow/handle complex stories while watching the movie. So, either CGI or story, but not both.And it became CGI, trying to compensate for the thin story, which it does pretty well. Mix Star Wars, and Mad Max, starship Troopers ... and you see the result in the Rebel Moon movie. What's missing is a bit.of Aliens...","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In our universe there is 3 trillion planets we can see. In rebel moon I'm sure there is similar. In rebel moon they have advanced ai robots who can do far more than any men, without food drink or breaks. For some reason, they decide to have a tear up as the evil empire wants their grain which about 10-20 people do painstakingly by hand. Why wouldn't robots do this on an abandoned empty planet? Nothing makes sense!What a load of tosh!I didn't feel any connection with any of the cliched, 2-dimensional characters so didn't care when any of them died.However, it gets a few stars for great visuals and CGI, the satisfying splashy-lava effect of the blasters, and the light-trail effects of the light sabres. The coolest moment was the James the mech with his cloak in his One Punch Man moment.Half the movie was the farmers harvesting wheat and after one day of combat training got a better kill-death ratio than any of the veterans.The other half of the movie was a guy turning the little wheel to aim the Dreadnaught cannon.Remind me never to watch any more Synder movies on Netflix.

Far better actions than part 1. Story line is actualy let's say no story line at all apart from defending the moon. Only one thing regarding the story line, the main characters are talking about their past and why they are against the main kingdom. So you can know the history of them which makes a sense of why they are fighting against the kingdom. It has some more behind the stories than protecting the moon village.Anyways as an overall I would give 7 out of 10 because part 1 has been leveraged by this and mostly this obe has better actions.

The acting is pretty bad and some of the costume choices are questionable. But the visuals and the action scenes are very good. Watch on a good TV with a good Sound system. Keep your remote handy and fast forward through all the Various montages (you'll recognize them when you see them). That way you don't have to tolerate the ridiculous dialogue and can enjoy action and visuals that Marvel used to do.I'm not sure what Zack Snyder was trying to do with this movie. We've got western, sci-fi, steam punk etc. It's all a bit strange. He should definitely stick to his day job as a Director and give up on screenwriting. However, I found the fight scenes well choreographed and the CGI and visuals actually added to the movie. I will say that Ed Skrein stands out in this movie as the evil Admiral. He steals every scene that he's in. He knows he's in a cheesy sci-fi movie and plays it perfectly.Sure, I would've liked a better story, better acting, etc, but it's a decent Saturday night popcorn movie. Just don't feel that you have to waste time on scenes that slow down the pacing (and there are more than a few). I think that's what most people are complaining about. Just skip them. I promise you will not lose the plot by doing this. It does culminate into a pretty decent finale.Anyway, that's my take. It's a two hour movie that I watched in less than an hour and a half. I would apply this same strategy to part I, though I spent less time fast forwarding through that movie. Obviously, it's been set up for a Part III. I'll have my remote handy. 😉","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Finally a big finale that will make your sub woofer jump across the floor.I rarly write reviews, but this movie actually needs some positive love. To the film, sfx, 3dfx and actors, great job!

As for Snyder, he needs to do some self analysis, self criticism and remove himself from the cult of 'yes men'.

However, after two hours and 15 minutes, Part One proved unsatisfactory and half-baked action movie cobbled together from parts of more inspired genre fare. Rebel Moon Part Two: The Scargiver offers only a slight improvement, thanks to its simpler story and more enticing climactic battle, but two more hours of the same shallow characters and plot. The plot of The Scargiver plays out like Seven Samurai/The Magnificent Seven meets Return of the Jedi, with the warrior crew returning to the moon of Veldt to protect the villagers from the Imperium army. With a ticking clock counting down until an Imperium dreadnought arrives, Snyder spends a gratuitous amount of time showing the villagers and warriors harvesting the land. The voiceover of Anthony Hopkins' mechanical knight, James, is confounding and provides little value to the story, except for a late tag-team entry into the fray. ""Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver"" is the second installment in Zack Snyder's sci-fi series, featuring a group of space-Amish farmers who face off against cartoon baddies with jackboots and glowing swords. The film's trademarks, such as extravagant lens flares and slow-motion shots, are used with abandon, and while Sofia Boutella delivers a balletic elegance in her fight sequences, it ultimately lacks a uniqueness. The film draws from various influences, including Star Wars, Mad Max, Caravaggio, John Ford, European art-house cinema, World War II propaganda flicks, steampunk Victoriana, cottagecore girlies on Instagram, and Wagner's ""Götterdämmerung."" The score features two types of choirs and a single frame might include a robot dressed like the Green Knight and a Conan the Barbarian clone. Despite its generic content, ""The Scargiver"" is a delirious, pulpy mishmash of knockoffs. The first ""Rebel Moon"" was released on Netflix in December and featured a farm boy named Gunnar and a secretive assassin named Kora. The story picks up five days before the squad must defeat a vicious army led by an admiral (Ed Skrein) with a bad haircut and worse attitude. The script by Snyder, Kurt Johnstad, and Shay Hatten is a mix of exposition and soliloquies, with no authentic conversations. The film features primal, pitiless, and agonizing carnage, with Snyder excelling in his ability to kill anyone, even nice people and grandmothers-turned-guerrilla warriors. The film has plenty of death, but little life, with Boutella, the lead, being listless until she can stabbing. Slow motion footage is used in scenes where actors seem to be ordered to ignore food. Snyder's ostentatiousness is unmatched, with his refusal to dial down any of his impulses, such as dramatic smooches and priestly hats. The film's moral debate is reminiscent of Kevin Smith's ""Clerks,"" where the moral debate revolves around the never-seen workers who died building the Death Star for Darth Vader. Snyder shows their faces and mows them down, making it a more realistic portrayal of the battle.","12 out of 27 found this helpful.

I'm not a great fan of Rebel Moon Part One, but it was acceptable. Part Two, however, is mostly just bad and boring. If Zack Snyder's intention was to produce a strong sedative, he accomplished the mission with excellence. I consistently had the impression that someone had a script with lots of checkpoints, and that's it. On top, just imagine for a moment that some skilled warriors and some peasants want to fight the forces of the USA or NATO... Anyway, the production is solid. If you don't mind a mind-numbing story and only watch the action sequences (especially the prolonged battle in the last act), you may find a little entertainment while saving some of your lifetime. In my opinion, Part Two is a new all-time low in the oeuvre of Mr. Snyder. Is this still the same director who made movies like the remake of Dawn of the Dead, 300, Watchmen, and Sucker Punch? If yes, what happened to his skills and taste? One last note: the most fun I had was discovering which scene or idea was borrowed from which other movie...","19 out of 40 found this helpful.

You begin to think maybe there is hope. And then right at the 40th minute mark (i.e. Almost the middle of the SECOND movie) a character stands up and asks that he wants to know the people he's about to fight side by side with. This in turn prompts a montage that is narrated by each character reading his or hers wiki page. That is of course in case the poor viewer has already forgotten the first movie and the fact that the same characters have already fought side by side with one another and have had the same introductions except the first time we didn't get a montage. I guess Zach Snyder knew that for part 2 WE ARE GONNA NEED A MONTAGE! Montage....After this action begins to ensue with all the tropes you can think off - from dumb evil guys being dumb and evil to the power of friendship that beats everything.Oh, and slo mo, because where would we be without it.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

Sadly, his kindergarten-grade storytelling abilities betray him everytime he tries to direct.He could be an amazing videogame cutscene designer, or an interesting director of photography.

This is a man who went from making a Kia commercial to getting a shot at directing the Dawn of the Dead reboot. From that movie to 300 I've followed this directors evolution. The DC films I enjoyed. Suckerpunch wasn't the best but it really was unique. Once he made an open ended deal with Neflix though it was too much. Just like Shyamalan with Sixth Sense he was able to basically do pet projects. M Night came out with a few stinkers until he was humbled a bit by fans. Honestly even Nolan's Tenet was just too much to be enjoyable. Ridley Scott's Napoleon was equally horrible. Now it's gonna happen but I sense it happens more often when a director is completely unrestrained. I feel between Snyder's goofy ass Army of the Dead which was a horrible mess of comedy, no edge like Dawn of the Dead to his recent terribly written and poorly cast Rebel Moon films. So cliche sci-fi world building just so bad. It like a fabulous looking gourmet meal but tastes bad and has no flavor. I mean at least add some edge to the film, some extreme violence or nudity. I mean I would expect this from JJ Abrams (except with lens flare and not slow mo). Very disappointed again with Scargiver. Some directors should explore their roots again and realize they can't always create fabulous source material from pet projects. Like what Peter Jackson did with LotR or Villanueva is doing with Dune please Zack get some awesome screen writers and build off their material. I appreciate your work Zack good luck with your future projects.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

The film doesn't do anything to build upon the few things that intrigued me from the first part and it just makes this whole ""experience"" feel like a complete waste of time in retrospect.Part One felt like a complete exposition dump to set up for this film yet the first hour is still devoted to filling in the blanks of this totally uninteresting world and characters. The dialogue is at best forgettable and at worst completely self-serious without a hint of self-awareness that made a lot of the character interactions cringeworthy more than anything. That first half was excruciatingly boring without any kind of tension building, the actual plot essentially revolves around farming grain and it's about as interesting as it sounds. When the war both these films have been building towards finally comes to ahead it feels like a relief in all the wrong ways because I was just happy to see something meaningful finally happen.When I say the second half was an improvement that's not really saying much but at least I was moderately entertained. The last hour is essentially a non-stop battle and while it can devolve into visual noise after a while at least it feels like Snyder in his element. The pacing finally picks up and there's actually a few interesting visuals on display with some genuinely entertaining sequences. But after a combined 3-hour build up I think it all came a bit too late for me. Writing really isn't Snyder's strong suit and in future I'd prefer to see him either stick purely to directing or adapting material because that seems to be where all of his best work comes from.When all is said and done, Rebel Moon represents a colossal misfire for Zack Snyder as a director. I didn't think Part One was a good movie but I had a modicum of hope that The Scargiver would give us some good pay off that would make these movies feel worthwhile. The whole thing just ends up being a massive slog and it's not nearly entertaining enough to make up for how hugely derivative it is. Rather than feeling like a complete story, this movie ends with set up for yet another sequel that I don't know if I have the energy to endure, Snyder fan or not.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

This is the case for Rebel moon, the series of movies were announced, even before the first one came out. Now, Rebel Moon Part two: The Scar giver is out, it is directed by Zack Snyder, and stars Sofia Boutella from Kingsman: The Secret Service, Ed Skrein from Deadpool, and Michiel Huisman from Game of Thrones.Kora (Sofia Boutella) goes back to her hometown; there she and the rest of the villagers prepare to fight against the mother world to keep their grain.Back in the day, Snyder wanted Rebel Moon to be a Star Wars movie for Disney. Luckily, Disney did not go along with the idea, especially since Rebel Moon is a bad movie. It is boring, and there was no reason to make Rebel Moon two or more parts.Part one of Rebel Moon was not particularly good ither, all Kora did was go to different planets, to get warriors to help fight along side the farmers. I was hoping part two would be a little better, since they would have to have a battle. Yes, towards the end there was fighting, but I do not care about any of the characters. The only two characters that had a little intrigue were the little boy and the robot. The boy, for some reason, has a connection with the girl that has a light saber looking like weapon. In part one Jimmy (Anthony Hopkins), also known as the robot, was on the wrong side of the fight. As the movie went on however, he changed sides, which was one of the only interesting things in a boring movie. In the first half of part two, I wanted to fall asleep. All they did was farm, which seems like a waste of time, especially in a movie.Snyder has made it clear that he wants to make an entire Rebel Moon universe, with six films. I find this very funny, since these two movies do not have anything in common with other good franchises, such as Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. These movies provide world building and take time to get to know the characters. Whereas Rebel Moon Part two: The Scar Giver will only give you boredom.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

Q. Is the Wheat Superpowered and gives you temporary Superpowers every time it's eaten, so that you can continue and make it even easier to conquer other planets? A. No it doesn't do that, it's just Regular Wheat. Q. What? That's it? Wait, Hold on a Minute....🌓 - Q. Can't this Intergalactic Empire Make other types of food? Can't they find other food sources somewhere else in the Galaxy? A. No, they can't, but there's something about that wheat though, I'm telling you.🤦🏻 - The Village has around 200 people. Q. Well that's good, should be an easy defeat if things go sour right? A. Well no, the Villagers have Better Battle Tactics, such as digging ditches underground, and making underground tunnels, so they can surprise attack the Empire. Q. What? I thought this Intergalactic Empire has Superior Weapons, Equipment, Armour, Land & Air Vehicles and Tactically Trained Soldiers? A. Yeah, but the Villagers have Pitchforks, a couple of Rocket Launchers, Some Musket Guns, Axes and Swords. Q. What? Are you joking? A. No.Do you get the Picture?More Buffoonery -🙇 - The Final Battle was Ridiculous with the Numbers and lack of numbers on the other side, and it also turned into Star Wars Point Blank Misses by Storm Troopers Stuff.🤦🏻 - The Bridge Battle with Tarak, General Titus & The Villagers was an absolute Embarrassment of a Watch. Watch the Celebration Aftermath 🎉of that battle, with the villagers holding damn Melee Weapons in their hands after beating Assault Rifled armed Soldiers. 🤦🏻🤦🏻 - Tarak is running around with 2 damn axes, whilst Red Laser Gunfire Beams are flying all around him and not a single bullet hits him? It reminded of how stupid the Storm troopers were in the Star Wars Films.😂 - It got to a point where it became an absolute Laugh of a Watch. Atticus Noble decides to destroy the grain 🌾 because Kora is there at the village? But what about all that fuss noble kicked up at the village in part 1?Things I actually liked about the film -🌌 - The Visual Effects During the Battles were Great, I really liked the shots and the choices of the framing and it looked Stunning at times, with Smoke, Dust, Lighting & Slow Motion. The Hallway Gunfire scene with kora was good and the Jump by Kora in Slow Motion with the Handgun was Great to see.👍 - The Backstorys of some of the characters, I would like to see more of that because it's actually better than this current time line.👘 - Again on the Backstorys, the Costume Designs were Eye Gazing, absolutely beautiful costumes, coupled with the gorgeous cinematography & Visual Effects.👱- So Princess issa was the one to dismantle all War Operations of the Motherworld, but Balisarius was not happy with this New Direction at All. And made Drastic Plans with Many other Nobles within the Empire. This Plot Point is so good. Is Princess issa the Key to a New Motherworld? ""I Forgive You"" - Did issa say that to Kora, knowing of Koras Forced Betrayal, yet also knowing the true extent of her Powers, Knowing the Pull Through and that all is not Over?🎁 - I liked the Gifts scene when the young villager girl gives Kora & her companions gifts during the party 🎉Overall, other than some of the Visual Effects and Close Shots(which I liked) in certain Scenes, the actual premise is so laughable that it turns into sheer Buffoonery. Get some drinks and some of your friends around. And there's that side of the entertainment factor.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

But there are so many boring scenes of the little space Irishmen dancing and singing and congratulating each other. This put me to mind of the other magnificent flop movie Heaven's Gate, which had musical and dance sequences way out of proportion to the main body of the film at hand. So many heroes and we must also sit and listen to their backstories which go on endlessly. I'm glad they didn't have a DOZEN heroes, or the movie might have been 4 hours long.The final battle was capable, though. There hasn't been quite so much slow motion since 1999 (Matrix). The battle CGI was of higher quality than some of the other places where, like the resuscitation of Noble (which looked like a Residents video, incidentally), it seemed added as an afterthought. They don't scratch film any more, you know.The plot is quite turgid and people formerly though killed keep reappearing healthy, including a princess (we learn at the end). Clearly a device to make a 3rd episode possible.It's clearly worth a watch just for all the ultimate noise and commotion. My one disappointment is that Anthony Hopkin's robot doesn't get to do a whole lot in the 4 hour runtime of the franchise. I was hoping he'd turn out to have unexpected powers or hidden secrets, but he's just another cast member of a too large cast.I will watch the next one, if it shows up. Once.","12 out of 24 found this helpful.

The Rebel Moon sequel that no one except Snyder asked for, is currently streaming on Netflix. It quite seems like the next batch of bland, forgettable films that'll enter the same league as the dreadful Transformers sequels. Part Two begins with Sir Anthony Hopkins' voiceover summing up the events of the first flick in a few lines. Snyder then takes a long time detailing Admiral Noble's resurrection (yawn!) and the village of farmers going about their business of cinematically harvesting grain. Snyder (who also puts on the DOP's hat) shoots them like music videos, lens-flaring the hell out of everything. Unlike the first, the action here unfolds mostly during the day, so the dark industrial grey aesthetic is almost replaced with what looks like a dusty, twilight-hour palette.It takes exceptionally bad writing for the screenplay to focus less on what was supposed to be a ""battle for grain"" and turn into a Star Wars knockoff. That was already an issue with the first film, and nothing really changes here. The warriors supporting Kora in her quest to defeat Noble each get five odd minutes of a music-video-backstory, and I couldn't wait for the (long-ish) first act to just get over and move on to the action. The story arcs are terrible, the character development is bleh, and none of the performances are rousing. The film stays emotionally flat from start to finish - the stakes feel next to none, the deaths of key characters leave no impact.Again, with writing this derivative and barebones, there's nothing Junkie XL could've done to make the proceedings any better. While nothing to write home about, the set pieces in the sequel feel less choppy (a typical Netflix trait) and even the excessive slo-mo didn't bother me all that much. In 2024, the same year where Dune: Part Two exists, it'd take a beyond-superlative effort to mesmerize audiences with a colonial space-warfare story.

With also what looks like LED lighting. I know its a sci fi fantasy film and that sometimes you have to dispel belief a little but I just thought that didn't make any sense. I then read some of the reviews mostly 1or 2 stars and decided not to waste any more time. I was actually hoping it was going to be better. Maybe if I have some more time to waste I'll give it another chance. Isee some of the reviews say part 2 is better.

Some of the character development and dialogue was also pretty weak.Overall though I found this movie to be entertaining. Yes the first half of the movie is slow and does a lot of recapping from the first movie but I didnt see that as a bad thing. The battle was long and looked visually nice.The lack of a conclusion was honestly my biggest gripe with this film. After 2 movies with no 3rd movie approved they left a massive cliffhanger. I am guessing they did this intentionally hoping there would be enough of an outcry of support for the studio to green light another one.This is one of the main reasons I dont watch tv shows anymore as they constantly are cancelled and never finish telling the story. I wish studios would stop with this nonsense and just tell the whole story or don't bother at all. I find myself getting less interested in films overall as time moves on. If no one is going to tell a complete story then I don't want to waste my time and money on any of it.I do hope there is a 3rd movie to finish off the story but based on a lot of the reviews and the amount dislike of the movie I have seen, I would wager it wont happen.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

I was wrong, very wrong. It is exactly more of the same. Here Kora along her companions barricade themselves in 'Veldt', Kora's home, and prepare for the attack of the Realms forces. With cringe worthy dialogue, an unbelievably annoying villain and yet again a predictable chain of events, this film flopped miserably.I am guessing both films were filmed simultaneously for there were no improvements whatsoever from the backlash of the first film. Most performances were weak and over dramatic, a lot of which in my opinion is due to the writing. I had numerous points in the film where I laughed uncontrollably while supposedly serious scenes were taking place.Kora's narrative for this entire film was to earn herself redemption for her previous actions and by doing so maybe start a new, peaceful life. That's why in her moment of truth she completely abandons her moral plans and has a change of heart. Her character was written to be a selfless hero, but to me came out as a pretentious bore.More of the same. Visually boring, bad writing and bad performances. Again, the ending is meant to set up more sequels that I believe won't happen. Not recommended.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Following a brief recap by Jimmy the robot, the film picks up with the surviving members of the ragtag rebel crewn/ croon (see what I'm trying to do here?) arriving back on Veldt thinking they aren't in a sequel and won't have to defend the village that hired them after all. However, it soon becomes apparent that they are in a sequel and that the baddies are coming not only to take the grain they were promised but also to capture some high-value targets and likely kill everyone in the community as well. The team must prepare the farmers for the upcoming battle; the supposed 'training' mostly consists of slow-motion farming montages and one or two brief scenes that establish the farmers are somehow completely competent in the art of war despite the fact that most of them have never even held a gun (seriously, these sequences don't show anyone failing at any time, instead portraying them all as just instantly as gun-savvy as John Wick). The movie's first half culminates in a laborious scene in which the main warriors sit around a table and take turns trauma dumping their dreadfully generic backstories that are all essentially the same as each other. I don't think it's a spoiler to say that the film's second half is where its big battle finally kicks off (that's what one-and-a-half film's worth of buildup has been about, after all), and - to be fair - the skirmish itself is fairly entertaining in its own generally subpar way. That sounds like I'm hesitant to admit that it's good, but I just want to make sure I'm not making it sound better than it is. In a more competent film, it wouldn't be up to par; here, it's more enjoyable than you'd expect. Still, it struggles to balance its various elements and plays out like a string of loosely connected vignettes rather than a cohesive sequence. The characters feel like they freeze whenever they aren't on screen and there's no sense of stakes because the movie has never really done any character work (even when it thinks it's doing character work). We just don't know any of these people and the spectacle isn't spectacular enough to truly hold your attention based solely on its aesthetics alone. Like the first film, the experience is entirely inconsequential. It's empty fluff that somehow cost millions of dollars. Its incredibly limp and bizarrely vague sequel-tease ending (which, by the way, does the opposite of get you excited for a potential follow-up) feels entirely contractual and devoid of any real energy on the part of anyone involved. It's emblematic of the odd oxymoron at the feature's core: it's a passion project that seems to lack any real passion. Zack Snyder has butchered his own work here, and it's hard to see how his long-promised ""director's cut"" (which makes no sense considering he seems to have had full creative control from the moment Netflix got involved with him) will make any of this any better. The problems run too deep for that. This may be better than its predecessor, but it's still not good enough.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I had to sit and watch each one of them telling their life story that was exactly the same as previous one, only character has changed. The script was probably shredded first and then glued together because it just didn't make sense. Zack Snyder brought Cheesy to another level which I didn't know it was possible, the slow motion scenes lasted for almost half of the movie I found myself skipping movie forward. The technology, apparently movie is set in the future, yet they use analogue buttons and switches and the rocket engines leave trail of smoke like a Russian Volga car from the 80s, I have even seen an empire soldier contacting his superior over an analogue phone with a cable.

Not only does the script not make sense, it contradicts itself in some sequences. There's no character development to speak of, not only do they behave oddly and against their characters, it's written objectively, they just serve as tools for the next big scene. And that I think is the biggest problem with this film, you have no one to identify with, it's impossible, Mr. Director has made a moving poster for how he would imagine a sci-fi soap opera. The dramaturgy is absolutely non-existent, there was no one there to not only watch over the characters, the dialogue, but also the setting and the complexity of the scenes. The music is dysfunctional, absolutely monumental in the banal scenes, and conversely, in the powerful scenes, either weak or completely unemotional. It's sad to see the director of such a seminal pop culture film as Watchmen get to direct Rebel Moon. I hope no one gives him money for a third sequel...

But its way better than an average Netflix movie. The movie could have been way better with a big studio and production house behind it. The story is solid but again could have been much better. I heard WB turned it down. I feel it could have been a great movie series with more investments, writers, producers, dialogues, a little more touching portrayal (the story is there but lacks representation). Maybe will get to see more in the extended cut.Overall, the movie is very good in my opinion. Watching the two movies together back-to-back is better. Don't suggest listening to those giving 1 or 2 rating. They just have some personal vendetta against Snyder. Without any bias, its a solid watch without any nonsense or stupid jokes.","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

No one told Zack ""NO, THAT'S A STUIPD IDEA"" once during the entirety of pre-production, production, and post-production. The first movie was at least a 7 Samurai rip off. The second one didn't even have that going for it.I literally found myself watching YouTube videos while it was playing in another tab, it was that boring.The dialog was terrible. The pacing was terrible. There was character development, but that character development was so formulaic that it was almost comical. Yet, I think that what bothered me the most was the juxtaposition of sentient androids with WWII style naval guns on a SPACESHIP!I mean, what sort of civilization can build sentient androids and build faster than light spaceships and still can't build a decent targeting computer!? Who?!And the grain as a plot device!? Sure, sure, grain worked as a McGuffin in 7 Samurai, but that's because the film took place in an agrarian society! If a civilization can build robots and spaceships and has a power source capable of traversing lightyears of distance in mere days, then one would think that they'd be able to automate something as mundane as food production.I can't tell you how many articles I've read about lab grown 3D printed meat in the past few years. Not to mention the fact that you can buy Impossible Burger at the supermarket for the same price as real meat (of course, real meat would probably be twice the price without the corn subsidies...).My willful suspension of disbelief has hereby been revoked.

It is not needed and becomes a total chore to sit through. It seems to have become Zack Snyders one-trick-pony and is really overused.If that isn't enough the first half of the movie moves at such a glacial pace nothing of any interest happens. The actors are all mediocre to bad and I didn't develop any affinity to any of them or care about any of the characters at all.Many of the plot elements make no sense at all, people have primative farming tools and advanced weapons, it's just badly thought out nonsense. Apparently this franchise was handed around and even supposed to be a Star Wars spin-off, its clear to see why nobody wanted it and I'm surprised Netflix hasn't cancelled it already.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

I find those opinions lack the insight to think about what drives these characters and that brings all this heart to the screen in a very underwhelming way at the beginning of this grim tale.And say what you will about Zack Snyder but he knows why these basic simple responses and lingering silences portray a deeper meaning other than what a undiscerning viewer cant be bothered to understand in the bigger picture. In that way he adds a nuance that many miss.These are sophisticated world killers brought down to the literal earth by the wisdom of those who cultivate it. There is no need and it would almost be insulting to do other than the best they can to face what they know better than all those around them is:Certain death.The villagers empathy and the warm bosom of this village that will stand with them against annialation touches them all and those that know death so intimately are humbled by their stolid hope.This is the emotional tone set early on that brings all together in a last bid to save all that these humble people are. Then when the dreadnsught arrives everyone knows as the viewer now knows what folly the resistance they will mount is. The killers never were in doubt from the beginning, but they steel themselves for the work at hand!Then the vision of Zack Snyder takes over. What transpires is one of his best David meets Goliath battles put to film! Full of guerilla and grey man tactics that doesn't rest on much more than human will and vast lifetimes of experience and the force be damned. Ed Skrein is an impeccable villain - as tough as they come and never to go down easy. It makes for a very satisfying resolution to this conflict in which the third film is hinted and I will be eager to see this formidable band of badasses fight for whats right,One more time.","9 out of 22 found this helpful.

Yet, from the opening scenes to the closing credits, I found myself grappling with a profound sense of disappointment. The expectation of embarking on another epic journey, similar to Snyder's past triumphs, quickly faded, replaced by a realization that this was not the masterpiece I had hoped for.The casting, usually a strength in Snyder's projects, felt off this time around. Despite the presence of some notable names, the performances were lackluster, failing to captivate or convey the emotional depth typically associated with his films. It was as though the actors were not fully invested in their roles, or perhaps the direction failed to extract the best from this ensemble.The narrative itself was another point of contention. Where Snyder's storytelling has often been praised for its complexity and depth, ""Rebel Moon"" presented a plot that felt superficial and unengaging. The storyline seemed to meander without a clear direction, leaving me yearning for the layered narratives I've come to expect from his work.Comparing this to watching a short film on Dust - an outlet I admire for its innovative and thought-provoking content - might seem like an odd juxtaposition. However, the expectation for a Netflix and Zack Snyder collaboration is naturally set at a much higher bar. Dust shorts, while entertaining and insightful, operate within the realm of independent filmmaking, often with limited resources. In contrast, a project like ""Rebel Moon,"" backed by Netflix's considerable resources and Snyder's visionary direction, should transcend these limitations.Yet, the experience felt akin to watching one of those shorts, where the constraints are palpable, and the scope is inherently limited. This isn't to discredit Dust's contributions to the sci-fi genre but rather to highlight the disparity in expectations. From a powerhouse duo like Netflix and Zack Snyder, one anticipates a cinematic experience that pushes boundaries and sets new standards, not one that merely echoes the feel of an indie short film.In sum, while ""Rebel Moon"" might have had the potential to be another jewel in Zack Snyder's crown, it ultimately fell short of the mark. It's a stark reminder that even the most successful filmmakers can sometimes miss the target, leaving fans like myself in a state of reflection on what could have been.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

In bad movies, in a mess of a series of films? No thanks.If you were hoping part 2 was going to redeem part 1...uh, no.Zach Snyder's films look cool. No denying that. There's a following. That's indisputable.But all of his films (with him writing in particular) have story, plot and dialogue issues. This film is no different.There is so much exposition (indiscriminately dropped in) that the main story comes to a screeching halt every time. And that exposition? Stupid. Rehashed dull crap.If you have never seen the several versions of Seven Samurai, watch any of them for a better play on the central plot in this film. George Lucas and others have already plundered great Japanese film epics and retreaded spaghetti westerns to develop science fiction films hundreds of times. The modern audience is wise to this, and there is so much content out there that they can smell lame junk from the back row.There are too many coincidences, too many holes in the plot, too much lame dialogue (that some of the actors had HUGE difficulty delivering) and too many forced attempts at shock and awe.It's a shame really. The small story idea around a rogue android gone wild is given scant service and little screen time. That story, expanded upon, could have been amazing. As it stands he shows up to save part of the day, and it's telegraphed from miles away. And the voice work for the Android is not right for his part. Feels like a strange homage to C-3PO.If you finished Part I wondering why all these heroes were willing to risk their lives to rescue a backwater agricultural village on an unremarkable planet... and why an all powerful evil empire would waste resources on it... well, you're going to be seriously disappointed with the answer. Because it's a gigantic nothing burger.Usually folks stick around in an action movie to watch the bad guy get clobbered. Well, not here. The front and center space nazi (brought back from the dead twice?) gets an important part of his body cut off by the heroine. But because this is the PG-13 cut, all of that takes place off screen. So no visual confirmation that the bad guy died. Lame.And the big bad? The guy who has been giving all the orders, and brought nazi-Ned back from the dead? He never shows up. Ridiculous.One of the biggest gripes I have with Snyder's films is that there is no comic relief. They all want to be taken so seriously that there is no joy when a hero succeeds, or a villain is defeated. It becomes more about reflecting on the loss and damage to arrive at the end result. Such a bummer.And the ending? Nope. Another cliff hanger. Will there be a part 3? Please no.So cue it up, watch it, shake your head, and then go watch The Seven Samurai.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

It feels like so much time was wasted on unnecessary elements, most of which should have been established in the previous entry.It also suffers from the worst of Snyder's tendencies, which we all know by now, and probably should've been edited differently as the pacing wasn't great.I personally felt that the first movie should've dealt with much of the characters bonding and backstory, mainly because out of two films we barely know anything about the motives of either faction and the movie hints at a lot more under the surface, it just doesn't ever get around to telling or showing any of it.I never thought I'd see it in a movie (partly because it's not something I ever thought would be in a movie), but, slow-motion corn harvesting is that thing! Life is now complete.Overall, while it had some pretty shots and VFX, it was a lacklustre experience with too many narrative and pacing problems to move it much past the 5* mark. These last two movies are why Zack Snyder is a director that needs someone to reign him in from time to time.Snyder once said he doesn't use slow-mo that much, but this movie alone has enough slow-mo that you could play four of five action movies by other directors, and they would still have less than this one does.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

The first installment left such little impressions that I completely forgot there'd be a second part.Well, I thought, why not see it through to the end? (And I sure hope this is the end of rebel moon)
There is no engaging story, there are so many plot holes/nonsensical scenes and/or dialogues.Most of all, I never cared. I was never made to care for the protagonists, the village, the ""heroes"" and I was never made to feel fear, anger or dislike for the antagonists.A few good special effects (outnumbered by many poor ones) and the slow motion scenes were painful. The score was boring and predictable.I feel bad for a couple of actors who I assume tried their best. With such a poor script and such poor direction I'm not sure how they could've done anything different.I surely hope this is the last of rebel moon. Netflix should spend its money on more quality productions.This was not an epic story, just an epic fail.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

As a long-time Snyder fan, I've admired his talent as a director with his distinct visual style, but unfortunately, Rebel Moon Part 2 falls victim to its dreadful script.This movie is a disaster.There are few good qualities in this chaotic mess of a film. The cast delivers reasonable performances given the material they're handed, and some action sequences showcase Snyder's prowess in that arena. Similar to Michael Bay, he knows how to handle action. However, any praise ends there.Part 2 is a tedious, uninspired, and ultimately futile mess. The first half retells what we've already endured in Part 1, with numerous scenes and flashbacks serving no purpose other than to elongate the runtime. The antagonist, whom I couldn't even summon the effort to look up, is forgettable at best, similar of Captain Phasma from the Star Wars sequel trilogy - appearing, delivering a few lines, then promptly getting beaten and bashed.There's little else to say about this film. It's a lackluster science fiction flick devoid of imagination, burdened by lackluster world-building, forgettable characters, and a narrative so unengaging you'd find more entertainment watching paint dry. It's annoying because Snyder has proven himself capable of greatness in the past. If further installments are going to be made, then they need to improve the script, because I would say I've seen better writing in Twilight.Rating: 3/10.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

It shows us just how far Netflix has fallen in the quality of its originals. A new low indeed. Horrible story, worsened by ridiculously bad acting, and topped off by pitiful directing. It's as if nobody who worked on it actually watched it before releasing it. And what the heck is the deal with the forced, over-used bokeh effect in most of the scenes?

The second compounded all the dross of the 1st and more which is quite a feat I reckon.I read in a recent interviwe the director Zack Snyder said Star Wars is so ingrained in our culture comparison is inevitable. This was pitched as a Star Wars story and passed on, thank god. Some aspects are more than lifted, simply tweaked, making this a generic space western, comitting the crime of spending millions on an often poorly acted, non-sensical, very poorly scripted and plotted pair of movies. Worst of all some of it is just plain dull- the 1st 15/20 minutes of part 2 is pathetic.Snyders's not made a decent movie since his debut Dawn of the Dead, which was a remake, when is this guy gonna give up?","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

This isn't one of the worst movies, and the visuals recommend it, but that's about it. The story simply didn't make any sense: You have a ruthless military man after just enough flour to keep his troops fed for a few days until he finds out that the moon is hiding someone he's been looking for. She grabs some soldiers to help defend the moon, and then it's their forces in opposition.There's a lot of filler in the movie. Everyone has to harvest the wheat BY HAND because the good guys need to be as anti-tech as possible (despite their weapons, their cybernetics, their spaceships, and some meds) and that slow-motion montage is followed by weapons training that takes up less time (because they're hunters, I guess, even though some of these people have no idea how to hold a rifle).There's even a section where everyone tells their background while sitting around that could have been handled by a few lines of dialog. Even the bad guy does stuff just so you'll know he's a bad guy; he's leader just because he's scary not because he's good at it.The acting is all over the place: It's usually pretty good but that's mostly because of the actors, not the direction; they take what they have and go for it. The heroine and villain, however, must have gained twenty pounds each from the amount of scenery they ate; she's sad and moody and he's just vile, but between them, they just don't take their roles above two dimensions.You just don't believe the soldiers were chosen for their training because they're just video game targets. The defenders are even worse because you see a lot of solo action rather than anyone really supporting one another; if they had, then the fight would have been a lot shorter.The visuals are awesome, however. Everything looks great, there are some iconic moments, and it's gorgeous. I love their glowy swords more than those in Star Wars, the costumes were beautiful, and the griffins against spaceships were great. I just wish the tech felt more futuristic; I love steampunk, but powering ships through coal just felt weird.In essence, this is what happens if you mashed the stories of Star Wars and Seven Samurai together and threw in elements of Jupiter Ascending. Incredible visuals, but it's missing so much else.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

This was famously Zak Snyder's attempt at making a Star Wars movie but Disney was smart enough to turn him down, so he very thinly disguised the Star Wars elements and made it anyway. So it's just bad Star Wars. But beyond that his whole new idea to freshen up the Star Wars universe? A bad Seven Samurai remake. So something that's already been done mixed a something else that's already been done. Pointless.Now saying it was Underdeveloped is a soft criticism. Snyder has his own extended cuts of these films that may correct some of the TERRIBLE pacing, but I can't see that being enough. This felt like someone shot an entire 8 Episode series and condensed it into 2 movies. And frankly, Snyder is just not a good writer. In fact, he's quite bad. I think he is a great director, he can make things look good, but this was just embarrassing at times. The battle scenes felt like a bunch of 8 year old's playing war in their back yard. So much of this movie was stuff presented as being very important with nothing to make the audience feel that way. There are cinematic cues that imply a feeling, but no information. Like all of the stuff with the robot being presented all dramatically. Who was he again? Someone who was mentioned for 3 seconds in the first movie? You can cue the music and people can gasp, but I'm still confused.Maybe I'll give em another try when Snyder releases his versions, but as it stands these two movies are just bad.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

And they wasted it all. The battles were stupid. The people were stupid. The strategies were stupid. The motivations were stupid. The technology was stupid. The economics were stupid. The politics were stupid. Everything in this story was stupid. I understand they wanted to remake Seven Samurai, but they basically took the samurai, removed their fighting skills, gave them a compulsion for overtalking and gave them stupid laser guns. And the ending was spectacularly stupid, as it was revealed that they risked everything to defend a village, when there were higher stakes involved.Even if you have no idea how to write, how difficult was it to set up a realistic battle with a military instructor. Just give the guy some money and he will tell you what they would do if they had a bunch of soldiers backed by a few tanks and several flying gunships or if they were besieged by the same and all they had were guerilla fighters. I can suspend my disbelief in the story if you show you actually gave a damn about the rest. Or you can set up really dumb scenes if you have a good story. But if you have none of those, why even try?!What is even worse, many of the events in the second part invalidated much of the first. The more I wrote in this review, the more stars I removed. I wanted to say that the naysayers were a bit harsh and it was a watchable movie, but then my brain switched back on. This wasn't even entertaining. It was boring, pretentions and overwhelmingly stupid. Agh!","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

So good you want to set a special night aside to watch it, switch off your phone, cuddle with your significant other, and enjoy a special treat. But it's such a huge disappointment. I went in absolutely wanting and expecting to love this. The special affects and design are gorgeous, Snyder's distinct action style is fun, if not particularly surprising anymore. But the writing...whew. What a heck of a bottleneck.Every character is unequivocally flat in the least fun way. The script could have used a massive punch-up, because the dialogue is almost entirely utilitarian. If you like one-liners or just any expression of individualistic personality from a large ensemble cast, look much farther than here. The story feels incredibly reductive. Every character looks good on a marketing poster, but what you see is entirely what you get. The movie offers absolutely nothing from its characters beyond that first impression, and it's not the actors' fault--they're just not given anything to do that provides an opportunity to show any emotional range, hero and villain alike.The story is equally one-dimensional and predictable. If you're a fan of fantasy/sci fi, there's nothing here you won't feel like you've seen a hundred times before, and what's more, it doesn't even feel like they tried. And I'm not criticizing what I see as a failed attempt at trying something new, or flipping a tired trope--I could respect a good effort. There's no impression at all that the creative team even wanted to break ground with this film. It's like they sat down to plan and said to each other, ""Let's go back to basics, guys--let's write like our audience hasn't seen a science fiction film since 1960.""Again, I want to stress that I went into this film biased in its favor.

Even when the stereotypical love story arises during the conflict, it feels detached and unbelievable.Overall, the story falls flat and the slow motion is very overused like a podcast stuck at half speed. At some point you're just hoping it finishes quickly like that little league game you attended where your kiddo's team got smoked, your bleachers were silent, and you happily started thinking about the traffic on your drive home if you left soon.Do I recommend it?

Its length, two hours for each episode, feels due to lack of imagination, dialogue, and excess heavenly choruses instead nearly double, meaning for hours.

RM is science fiction vomit of Star Wars, Mad Max, Lord of the rings, but done incredibly bad. Thank goodness this was streamed and I didn't pay to see this garbage in the theaters.I will say that James the robot was the best thing about this movie, and stole ever scene he was in, maybe it was Hopkins delivery of his lines, or that James was the only actually believable character in this travesty of a movie. I can actually see James the robot becoming a cosplay character. He was genuinely the best thing about this movie. All I can say is thank you for fast forward.I will give ZS the benefit of the doubt, his version of Justice League albeit 4 hours was the movie we as the consumer should have gotten the first time. RM2 had so much backstory montages, it's like this was all cut from the first movie. Which in hindsight is probably what happened. Maybe there will a Rebel Moon: Zach Snyder edition that is the original cut of the movie that makes more sense than this patchwork of science fiction trash we got so far.Would I watch it again, no. Would I recommend it to a friend, no. Am I glad I watched it, no. But...I would recommend this movie for a long flight or car ride.I may come off too harsh, but I know Synder can make great films, Army of the Dead was superb, I just wonder how handicapped he is being by the producers, these two movies could have been one, and it would have a much better flow and feel. I am honestly disappointed in the quality of pictures being made now a days. With the few exceptions such as CODA, and The Batman, we haven't had very good movies in the last 3 years.As viewers we come to movies for an escape, long format is okay, Endgame, Dune, maybe it's time the 2 hour movie format goes away and directors make the movies they want to make.Thank you for your time in reading this.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

As a director, at what point do you actually sit back and reevaluate your filmmaking? I ask this, because Zack Snyder doesn't seem to care, or even try to learn and improve from missteps - such as an over reliance on slow-motion. I say this as a viewer that always hopes for a director to turn out a good product. But aside from a few okay extended cuts, his films have been largely misses.If you are reading this, you might've already made up your mind as to whether or not you'll view this sequel. I'm just here to vent like almost everyone on the internet. The Scargiver is somehow worse than its predecessor, and also less exciting. There is a core concept that seems to be interesting despite multiple elements being lifted from properties such as Star Wars. Which makes it even worse knowing that it's squandered. Such as character development, and overall plot structure.Now, I know Zack Snyder trolls will say, ""Just wait for his extended cut. That's when it gets good"". Problem is, there's nothing about this ""franchise"" that would justify, or improve the movie to warrant an extended cut. Zack Snyder shouldn't make his name being a director that makes good extended cut - he hasn't earned it. It's just a marketing gimmick for himself and his followers. Even then, some of his extended cuts are simply 'fine'. If you can't make some sort of coherent product on the first initial cut, then you probably aren't cut out to be a director.I say this as someone who wants to see him succeed. By all accounts Zack Snyder seems like a nice man with a signature visual flare. What he needs is a good set of writers, and people to reel him in when he gets off the rails. I hope he moves on to different projects and gets his footing, but by all accounts, The Scargiver is part two in a franchise that's already exhausting.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Overuse of slowmo scenes for no reason is so cringe. I got second hand embarrassment from watching some of the scenes that tried to be emotional but felt extremely forced and poor. And shame on Netflix for green lighting this project and spending 300-400 million dollar for both movies but keep canceling fantastic shows because they don't have enough viewers or they cost too much !!!

The first rebel moon was entertaining enough to me to make me excited, yes, excited for the 2nd movie. Even with all its supposed flaws, I was intrigued. So now I have to say, this is the worst fricken movie I have ever watched in my entire life. Given the world building the first movie sets up, I expected big plot points to be introduced in this one, maybe Kora meets her dad, maybe we get more development on the revolution, literally anything. The entire movie, TWO HOURS OF LIFE I WILL NEVER GET BACK is the group fighting against the general that should've died last movie. Frankly, his death back then was more satisfying instead of in this movie when he dies I just feel ""thank god it's over"". You can tell this movie was trying to pad out the run time too, the first half or so is just the village preparing for the battle and the preparation montage is in slow-mo every single chance it gets. No characters get any development in this movie, characters die and there is no pay off. There are no plot twists that incite any emotion except maybe in the first 5-10 minutes. I was planning on watching the third, but after this movie left me feeling genuinely upset about what I just spent my time on I don't think my curiosity can even motivate me to watch a 3rd. It's not even worth hate watching, this movie is plain boring with bad creative choices.TLDR: IF YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO ENJOY THE REBEL MOON SERIES, READ A SUMMARY OF THIS MOVIE AND SKIP STRAIGHT TO PART 3 (which I assume will be less horrendous when it comes out. I have hope)
I'm begging you, I'm being serious. I've never wrote a movie review in my entire life and this will be my first and possibly last on IMDB. I have never had a singular movie be the reason to make me drop a series indefinitely. This is the first.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The slow mo, sweet Jesus, ZS came out and said it is his style he loves it, fair enough, it's not for me, I personally believe some shots it can make it awesome but every action scene every few shots just slows the movie way too much, it loses the flow and becomes boring.Acting is fine, no improvement, some REALLY cool shots in this, the sky, the aesthetic itself is cool.

While it has typically been a pleasant experience, I decided to try their store-brand version of Little Debbie's Cosmic Brownies. To my dismay, I was dissatisfied with the generic alternative and found myself wishing I had spent my time getting Cosmic Brownies instead. Unfortunately, I find myself facing an ironically similar disappointment today.Rebel Moon- Part Two: The Scargiver is director Zack Snyder's second installment in his Netflix Original space opera. Despite Part One: A Child of Fire premiering in December 2023 to unfavorable reviews, Snyder and Netflix were already well underway on Part Two. While originally intending to create a trilogy of films, Snyder found it difficult to fit his vision in a typical 2 ½-3hr runtime (an issue he had previously suffered from while directing DC Comic's Justice League) and decided to split each film into two parts. Now, at the start of a 6-part saga, the Rebel Moon universe attempts to cement itself as a sci-fi epic for the ages.Picking up shortly after the ending of Part One, we see our ragtag team of heroes regroup on Kora's (Sofia Boutella) adopted home world, the moon of Veldt. The group warns the locals of an impending attack from the Imperium, an unfortunate aftermath of their previous encounter. With only 5 days to prepare for the invasion, the team must work alongside the villagers to protect their town or die trying.Rebel Moon- Part Two is unforgivably boring. Suffering from the sins of its predecessor, Part Two cannot handle its 2-hour runtime. While Part One was entirely set-up, the sequel stretches a finale into a full 2-hour film. Unbearably tedious, scenes drag on to questionable lengths, feeling as if there was little trimming done in an attempt to fluff the films runtime as much as possible. When that failed, an egregious amount of slow-motion was unnecessarily shoehorned into every scene. Matching Part One, there are about 45 minutes worth of slow-motion, which, if they had been cut, could have easily made this film more enjoyable. Rebel Moon- Part One & Two are not strong enough to stand on their own and would have greatly benefitted from being edited down into one complete film.Basing his vision off the Star Wars universe, Zack Snyder had stripped the world of any iconic and recognizable traits but failed to replace those with any of his own original or interesting ideas. Though you can clearly see where the inspiration came from, the lack of creativity holds the series back from forming a connection with its audience. Rebel Moon introduces characters, planets, and concepts that are truly difficult to remember or distinguish, as the entire film feels as if it is just placeholder for actual fully fleshed out ideas. Boiling Star Wars down to its most generic aspects, Rebel Moon is left feeling like a movie you would see playing within another movie.While the actors do their best to salvage the situation, they are held back by elementary-level dialogue and a paper-thin script. Suffering from telling, not showing, the film continually insists upon stating exactly how the audience should perceive each character, although we have never seen any of them portrayed to have those qualities. After two films and 4 1/2 hours, none of the characters stand out, with nearly all of them being completely forgettable if they aren't present on screen.Contrary to this example, Zack Snyder truly is a talented director, but he desperately needs the guidance of a gifted writer. While he has had many successes in the past (300, Watchmen, Man of Steel) he had always worked closely with the respective writers to achieve that success. On his own, Snyder hasn't quite mastered the balance and the result is films like Rebel Moon. I do sincerely hope he continues making movies, but I hope he sees these flaws and learns from them before attempting something similar to this project.The world of Rebel Moon was hindered before it began. Clinging to the idea of creating a Star Wars film, Zack Snyder held himself back from standing out and truly creating something original. Akin to a store-brand alternative to your favorite snack, Rebel Moon- Part Two: The Scargiver delivers a bland and unappealing attempt at copying an icon.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

I mean a movie to recrute the heroes must lead to something really good after, right?Well absolutely not. Because before going to this part two we need to go back to the part one. The end of part one lead us to a resolution that is taken away immediately, not even waiting for part two.You can skip the last act of the part one, adjusting a few things (or not) and then start this part two. Nothing of value is lost (lol).This part two is all visual (even then...) and no substance.Slow mo? Y o u g o t i t. Useless filling shot? Right. Not using the heroes that we spend one movie to recrute? Of course. Meaningful characters growth or something? Nope. A very unmotivated death, dumb even? Yes (the last one I don't care tbh). Ex machina? Nor really but close.It's close to a parody tbh, you don't need to change much to get it.

The stunts and action in the film were ""Revenge of the Sith"" level action! Amazing amazing acting from the cast, several times I was tearing up over the struggles of the story.

The first movie was sort of forgettable but mildly entertaining. This movie could have been 30 minutes shorter without all the needless slow motion. Anthony Hopkins must need money because there was no benefit to him taking part in this. The lead character is so unbelievable as a hero that it is distracting and she is not that good of an actress.

It's not original either, as you can pick up on many familiar things you have seen in other movies. It's no Lord of the Rings, Dune, Star Wars, and Game of Thrones.There is a scene where all our heroes sit around and share their backstories. After someone finishes their back story, they might as well say ""OK, your turn.""And when characters do bite the dust, I didn't care. You couldn't pay me to care about these guys.There is an R-rated cut for Part One and Two that Snyder is trying to drum up hype for, but I highly doubt there's a good movie somewhere on the cutting room floor. And why is there a director's cut when this is a streaming release and not a theatrical release? Why didn't they release the R-rated cuts to begin with? Because nobody is campaigning like they did for Justice League. So, people have to watch (in total) a six-hour-long movie. Why!? So stupid, lol. And bold of them to think that I am watching both films again.Zack Snyder is just like George Lucas, not a talentless hack, but he needs to stop surrounding himself with 'yes men'.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Forget about a larger sense of consistency across the film. I wish I could say that Snyder at least seems to understand how to create cool action. I think at one point in time he probably did - earlier films of his like Dawn of the Dead and 300 seem to suggest he had some clue about this. I don't know what happened, because even the main battle here was frightfully dull and full of nonsense like people rushing at each other with guns so that they could... hit each other with the guns. People look on as their friends get killed about 20 feet away, at which point they rush over to help them after it's too late. Protagonists have clear opportunities to kill their enemies but simply decide not to for no reason. We discover that the ships are powered by... coal. Yes, there are rooms on the ship where people are shoveling coal into the engines. But they also have scanning technology that rivals Star Trek.These movies should have written themselves.

Dialogues and remarks are obviously crafted to be dangerous and witty; but they're as hollow as dried gourds. Scenes of large-scale armed conflicts are miserably trivialized and reduced to victorious shouts reminiscent of tribal chants. The deaths of a couple of heroes are made-up to meet moral standards, and precisely because of that, instead of leading to apotheosis, they push the heroes into absurdity.Rebel Moon part I - 4 stars.Rebel Moon part II - 3 stars.Rebel Moon part III - I hope they never make it!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

This movie might have been a little bit more enjoyable if it was edited together better. Now before you start to think I'm a Zack Snyder hater I am not!

I've put it off for a few weeks but unfortunately, I have to now admit defeat and settle in for Part two of ""Rebel Moon"" - a series that, most worryingly, nobody seems to be able to determine how many films it's planned to be spread over. That confusion is demonstrated here, with a movie that should have been the third act of the last film but is instead dragged out to two boring hours.A resurrected Atticus Noble (Ed Skrein) sets his dreadnaught on a course for Veldt. His plan is now not only to take the grain, but to capture Kora (Sofia Boutella) and present her to the motherworld, where she is public enemy number one. Titus (Djimon Hounsou) starts to teach the farmers the art of guerrilla warfare, so they can defend themselves. Kora plans to attack the ship and kill Nobel properly this time, before she does, she admits to the gang her part in the assassination of Princess Issa (Stella Grace Fitzgerald).I feel sorry for Sofia Boutella, this and ""Argylle"" in the same year is an unenviable double bill. To be fair, none of the problems with this film are down to her, or any of the actors really. They're all just playing boring, lifeless characters in a boring, lifeless film. To be fair, this part is a bit less of a mess than part one was. That was a mishmash of cribbed and stolen ideas. Part two is, at least, coherent by only stealing one idea. The ""mercenaries teach the village to fight"" plot from ""Seventh Samurai"". It still looks good too, with the CGI budget being put to good use and still heavily leaning into Snyder's obsession with slow motion.But I just don't care. I don't care about these tedious cliché characters or their story that I've seen done before and better. I don't care whether they die or succeed, or what they reveal about their pasts. It's all so anodyne and I hate the artifice of the ""directors cuts"", exploiting history for a cynical attempt to make me watch this rubbish again.This is better than the first one, and if they continue to improve at this rate, Part seven might just scrape into acceptability.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I enjoyed the back stories, the acting was fine and the battle sequences were well constructed. I was certainly rooting for the rebels.Just because someone reimagines the future of space flight and puts a different spin on it with great visuals and decent CGI there's no way it warrants a 1* or 2* anything!

Zack Snyder shows that he's capable with captivating visuals and well-choreographed action sequences, but his screenwriting chops just don't cut it when he's doing a self-indulgent 'passion project' that was originally gonna be a Star Wars movie, and he takes character development as 'trivial' instead of seriously like any veteran director treats as equal priority with personal vision.Where to start with this thing? First of all, it feels like Part Two was more a threat of more-of-the-same that the last movie offered, and lo-and-behold: it pretty much is exactly that, except it's a 'pay off' to a culminate story that doesn't feel earned at all.Zack Snyder is a good director when he's got a good script to play with, but don't give him his own script. He'll lose all self-awareness and will go full blown George Lucas over his own lack of creative restraint or finesse on his own movies.Rebel Moon 2 MIGHT be potentially 'remedied' if they release an oversized cut that includes both movies back-to-back, and with extra coverage, but it'd be of little comfort for newcomers who've already heard what they need to know about the film already.This kind of film... it's a wonder Netflix said yes to this one, considering it's a blockbuster-budgeted film that didn't get a wide theatrical release (it got limited release before Netflix) to try and recoup the ridiculous amounts of money sunk into Zack Snyder's now infamous Star Wars ripoff. And they wanted this thing to be a 'franchise' comparable to Harry Potter, James Bond and the MCU, etc.Rebel Moon 2 brings closure to one of the most puzzling two-parters in recent memory, and has you wondering: is there gonna be anything else from Snyder or this 'franchise' afterwards?This is a bit of a weirdly boring movie, what with its development lacking any impact on viewers, and the abuse of the slow-motion technique hampers Rebel Moon in almost every conceivable way.This one's a 2/5 flop-sweat-maker. It's really not a well-defined movie like you'd expect from similarly high-concept directors tackling passion projects, but hey; maybe it'll inspire someone to do even better than what we got here.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

But almost all the characters are either vapid, unlikeable or just horribly fleshed out. The big bad of the first movie returns and is equally big and bad and so comically stereotypical it feels like a monkey has written the script.There isn't a huge amount redeeming for the movie, in theory the cast is pretty heavy hitting, but hugely let down by writing, plotline and plotholes. The visuals, as you'd expect with Zach Snyder are great but visuals don't make a movie good if you're lacking substance.Overall, it's not utterly awful.

Are vapid reality shows all you are looking for these days? Because that is where we are headed.While this movie won't win awards or even the applause of major reviewers, one thing it DID deliver on was entertainment. This second part of a story begun in Rebel Moon Part 1, started off slower and maybe a bit too much talking and celebrating the first win, it more than made up for it as the battle begins and continues.I loved that a simple farming community was able to destroy a major very bad and evil ruler in their world. Looking at our world today? It is easy to lose hope we can ever bring sanity back to world politics. But this movie, in its own little corner tells us that even the least of us can have hope for better days.The computer graphics were top notch. The human relationships were wonderful. Was it perfect? Of course not. But it was highly entertaining without mind numbing politics and references to hating certain people thrown in just because Hollywood can. This wonderful story was pure entertainment. It had heart. It had unity, it had great fight scenes, good cinematography, and acting.Yet most of you chose to ignore these obvious assets of this movie and hate it with every review. I don't get people today. You want entertainment, but you can't see it when it is handed to you on a silver platter. Maybe we deserve the dumbed down television and politics filled movies being spewed at us from every channel, every app on the internet. You revel in the reality shows that are taking over the apps like weeds in an unattended field.So, for those of you who hated on this movie? Enjoy your TV reality shows, your politics filled Dick Wolf shows, your growing and growing intrusion of sports proliferating when SOME of us just want fun entertainment. Obviously those of us are now in the minority. And unfortunately, we must endure the brainless TV taking over even the best apps on the internet. Whatever you do, do NOT watch Slow Horses on Apple TV. It is highly entertaining and will definitely bore you to tears!Rebel Moon Parts 1 and 2 are highly entertaining and well acted movies. Thank you Netflix for finally giving us an English language movie that was really quite good. I wish my rating could help pull up the overall ratings of these movies, but like elections, I only get one vote. I wish you all could have seen in these movies what I saw!

This continued throughout the movie and thats what it is with a wishy washy kind of back story about an Empire and a Royal Family overthrown told with flashbacks.Down to earth farmers get bullied by evil space empire then warned ""we will return"". Defenceless farmers find an ""anti-hero"" hiding amongst them (not a patch on Yul Bryner) and off she goes to gather some warriors to aid their plight.Part 2 sees these warriors return (6 yes thats right I said 6 warriors) plus our Anti-Hero (that makes 7 !)who with a twist is the adopted daughter of the evil empire baddie. I wont spoil the ending but I reckon you can guess what happens.There is a lot of characterisation padding, it could have been cut down to 1 movie leave your brain in the fridge and watch it then its an okay two parter. Watching the making of afterwards makes me think they were a bit deluded and must never have heard of the Magnificent Seven.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

In my life I have watched hundreds upon hundreds of blockbuster movies, and I can say with all confidence that 'Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver' is without a doubt one of the top three best breathtaking cinematic experiences I've ever gone through. INCREDIBLE!Firstly, this second part resolves all the issues of the first one by seamlessly integrating missing story elements. Secondly, cinematography is a remarkable upgrade, even surpassing the already impressive visuals of Part 1. Snyder has actually invented a new cinematic aesthetic!Finally, the direction of the 40-min battle sequence was nothing short of cinematic perfection. It is insanely immersive and grabs all your senses, not letting go until the end. The mesmerizing music by Junkie XL made me feel like I was on the battlefield!The ending of the movie teases more things to be explored in this one story alone in this very big and rich world. Netflix should definitely make a Part 3 to give this story and its characters a proper and satisfying ending, and then proceed to explore more stories from the world of Rebel Moon.","42 out of 150 found this helpful.

Too many flashbacks are needed to explain everything and now it's unclear where the next movie will go based on how this ended. There are still too many Star Wars rip-offs including flaming laser like blades that are colored blue, use of the term Imperium/empire for the bad guys and the rebel fleet.

Children of fire was about getting the band together and this one is about taking the fight with the bad guys.. But i found this one better than the first one in terms of screenplay and pacing.. You'll know about some background of the characters which will make you relate with them.. But some things seem off and I'm pretty sure Snyder has saved the real elements for extended cuts which will release somewhere in second half of 2024.. Action scenes were epic and visuals were awesome this is one department where snyder is unbeatable.. My favorite shot is when we see a small house at dusk with saturn like red rings can be seen in sky, OMG that shot will stay with me forever.. Set pieces were awesome like ships and laser weapons especially lightsaber like swords with cool wooshing effects.. I mean damn.. Snyder knows exactly how to make an movie awesome.. But story could've been better.. Overall I enjoyed this one a little more than i expected there is some world building that will be picked off in part 3 and I'm interested to see how this universe will grow beyond here.. Junkie XL's score elevates the cinematic experience.. Rebel moon franchise is inspired by old western and samurai movies with taking some elements from Star Wars which is not a bad thing rather it makes this saga more awesome... I'm happy Snyder found a new home at Netflix after what happened to him at WB, and they paid price for it... Don't listen to haters and enjoy if you love straightforward sci fi action films because hate towards Snyder is biased and these fake critics and fans forcefully hate him for no reason... But again this movie could've been more better.I'm waiting to watch the extended cuts to see the full vision and finally make my final verdict..

half movie peasants gather around, shout something then un-gather or some people (more of them or just a single person) go outside and look very concerned at the sky

Too much cinematic drama and not enough actual content. The final battle is good, but 45 mins in all they'd done is harvest wheat. This movie probably only has around 40 minutes of total footage, but they stretch it to two hours by playing 80% of the movie in slow motion. It gets really tiring.There are some good characters and impressive special effects. Netflix tried hard to make a blockbuster. But they would have been better off than just making a single movie that had decent pace, rather than two movies where they didn't have enough content to fill 4 hours.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Even the die-hard sci-fi fans call it ""an uninspired trainwreck"" - just like part I, the plot of which I already forgot.The film's success on Netflix (almost a billion viewership minutes) suggests that the streaming audiences ignore the horrible reviews (20% Rotten Tomatoes) because they are stuck to whatever the streaming service is offering them. And Netflix in return hopes to gain new subscribers to break even and offset this kind of huge investment!It is absolutely safe to not waste any time on this, skip it and instead watch or re-watch *Dune Part II* which is on the contrary a true cinematic masterpiece!","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

There are solid foundations for an interesting lore lying underneath the ridiculous shenanigans, you can see potential for a better story even if the movie doesn't live up to the expectations. Those are the only positives in Rebel Moon Part 2.The main problem is Snyder spends a minimal amount of time on character development and as a result you don't care about whether or not the rebels will live to fight another day, making the battle feel insignificant in the process and actors acting like emotionless robots for 70% of the time certainly doesn't help the situation.In the midst of the visual chaos there's something weirdly amusing about watching a director try his best to make something interesting, but failling every single time. There are many death scenes, dramatic moments, inspirational speeches, constant screaming and ridiculously ellaborate action sequences with excessive amounts of slow motion. These moments aren't supposed to be funny, but I couldn't stop laughing at the imcompetente storytelling. If you plan on watching this, make sure to stick around for the funniest cliffhanger in movie history.If you're looking for a guilty pleasure to entertain you for two hours, you won't be dissapointed. It's entertaining for all the wrong reasons tho. Once the numbers for this sequel show a gradual decline in viewership and popularity compared to the original, The streaming giant will think twice before giving Zack Snyder full creative control over anything. A franchise with 6 movies? I doubt it.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Maybe they knew this was a bloated mess and lost their enthusiasm.Rather than fill it with rubbish, Snyder should have made it a 2 part series (not 3) and taken the 30 minutes from this one and made a slightly longer Part II.It seems all he has done is upset those who watched Part 1 expecting some kind of payoff in Part II.

Snyder has proven beyond a doubt he is gunning for Ed Woods crown for worst film maker.Even with huge budgets and decent actors... this director has created some turds in his time and Rebel Moon ranks up there with Sucker Punch.The plot and writing and some of the performances in rebel moon feel like the start of a 70s porno... and that's something to behold.The reason he continues to have a career is because of his rabid snyderverse fans who have never left their basements and support his mediocre skills.This double feature is showcasing just how bad Snyder is in not just writing but directing.All I can say in the positive note is thankgod Snyder has been relegated to streaming for the rest of his life.It took me over 14 attempts to complete watching rebel moon parts one and two
And I will definitely not try to watch his directors cut later as I believe I would suffer permanent brain rot and end up like his snyderverse fans.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

My last thoughts are this could have easily been 1 movie if all the slo mo and unnecessary scenes were removed from the film.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Just lots of a action, martial art-esq fights, guns, spaceships... what's not to like :) But, that's it. The script isn't the worst ever, afterall the first film holds that title. But it's so basic and ridiculously implausible - only matched by the implausible bullet-dodging nonsense action. I know Star Wars Stormtroopers are hero blind, but this film takes it to a whole new level. In general I thought the cinematography was fine, although all the slow motion achieved was highlighting 'victims' being hit before the strike lands - honestly. The whole film has that pseudo amateur feel of a TV show. I think some ideas are well suited to a cartoon, and no, I don't mean animated film...I mean cartoon.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

Meanwhile, Kora, Gunnar etc are preparing for another big fight creating cunning traps, putting bombs everywhere etc around their small village.Whilst like its predecessor there is a great deal wrong with this, firstly the 'good' stuff. The action sequences, whilst we've seen them many many times before in better films are well staged and bordering on exciting, supported by seemingly hours of slow motion and a highly portentous score. On the downside, Snyder seems so eager to create his own galaxy far far away with associated history and lore he fails to create characters that will fill it - all they do is fight, roar as they charge into battle, make speeches and burst into tears, all without a scintilla of humour.Bottom line, I just don't think I truly understood all this. The cause of the vast empire of soldiers attacking this little village still seems geared around getting grain - really? And the politics is rattled out quickly in a short section at the start - again I wasn't clear on this - perhaps I'm
just not bright enough. Anyway it does seem as if Snyder is ready to make 2 more of these plus extended R rated versions of the first 2 parts are on their way - I'm so excited!","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The movie industry has become a consumer's market. I have noticed this for the past 10-12 years that, people are only consuming big star collaborative movies with nonsense plot, bad acting and mediocre script, with almost little to none emotional maturity, these type of movies only work because there are big face in them. Majority of the movies are such that the actors are playing themselves rather than playing the characters.Rebel moon also has many familiar faces, but they have solid script, characters have great chemistry, they show emotional maturity which died in the 90's or early 2000's I guess. These movies have wonderful CG scenes. The story is gripping, yes the progression is slow but not boring. The story is in parts so there will be some parts in the movie that is more talkative just build that momentum in the story and depth in the characters.I guess the audience have become too picky or they have lost interest in connecting with a good story. If these movies would have released in early 2000's, people would have gone crazy. I'm not saying that the movies look old, it's just that people don't like different things anymore.","10 out of 28 found this helpful.

Serious psychedelic drug abuse can be the only explanation for these horrible details. The rest of the story is filled with characters you can't identify with or like, plot lines that make no sense and just agh, it goes on and on, one flaw after another. I hope Netflix does the right thing here and asks Mr. Snyder to empty his desk and follow the nice man in uniform out of the building.

Snyder has a habit of wandering all over the place with side stories like many fantasy novel writers, which works just fine in a novel but I guess people don't like it in a movie. It doesn't bother me, nor did it expect to be blown away or receive enlightenment by watching this so I enjoyed it. But it didn't have a story (original story) I hear people say, who cares, most sci-fi is as much about the world building, action, spectacle, ships and gadgets as it is about complex or original storylines. Yes it's based on the Seven Samurai/Magnificent Seven trope and it isn't even the first sci-fi to do it, that was Battle Beyond The Stars, but it is a reasonably well crafted addition to the many retellings of this old story. Also maybe Snyder hate is a thing, but it's obvious that people genuinely didn't like this movie as well, which is their right, but if you don't hate Snyder, you like sci-fi and you're not expecting a blockbuster you might enjoy this movie. I did.","10 out of 28 found this helpful.

Such a ashame when they have wasted so much money on beautiful cgi. Rebel Moon only strength is the CGI.The problem with Rebel Moon is Zac Snyder used his previous super hero movies as base block building for this new universe and he's slipped up on a banana hard. I couldn't help think while watching that if I imagined and replaced the rebel moon characters with super heros from the avengers movie or DC universe. It literally could of been renamed and added to that universe.... That's how one dimensional the dialogue is... There aren't really any new original ideas and again, they seem to have weird time gaps in the plot.... Oh no were about to blow this thing up in a second... 20 minutes later in movie... Switches back to scene ok now we can blow up this thing. Just so plain awful.

Almost every scene was twice as long as it needed to be so the movie was just a slog to get through. So many scenes had slow motion every 10 seconds that made them even longer (seriously: 4 mins of watching people harvest grain wasn't bad enough so they added slow mo to make it even longer?)The deaths were unearned and seemed to be just tossed in randomly to try to drum up some drama. Even an overly-long scene explaining everyone's backstory (with - you guessed it - slow mo!) wasn't enough to make me care if they died. They were predictable deaths, too - choreographed way ahead of time just based on where the character was or what was going on around them.Honestly can't say a single good thing about this. It was about an hour long than it needed to be (as was the first.)

For and action movie, I really struggled to pay attention. The acting was sub par. The plot predictable (especially since there wasn't much to it.)

I was angry. Do you know how many good things you can do with such an amount of money plus working hours spent? No plot, no characters, absolutely nothing. How is it even possible that you can create a movie like this? Just imagine, I'm a poor village guy, doing my wheat with sickle, but we have a levitating carriage and a space ship is landing on my fields, requesting my harvest for the space army? One village will produce enough flour for space army for 3 days with hands? Ok, I understand, the art, the imagination, that's fine. But, then you need characters, story, you need something. On the other hand, you really need to put significant amount of effort to make such a bad movie. Watching the movie was really a difficult experience. Movie crew, if you are reading this, please understand, by being an actor you agree to put art in the first place, not your bank account. You are all young, so please choose your roles more carefully. Absolute disaster.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

They use horses and sickles and they work hard for the flour. But then they start using the sickles as weapons, against the intergalactic force! And they had hammers too, and the women working the fields started shooting with guns. And a chinese lady had two laser swords and she was menacing.

Well, as much as one quick and generic flashback per character could be called ""addressing the issue"", anyway. And it had more action and less indescribable pretended English accents. And overall, it's a pretty picture with a bunch of heroic characters and a fight for the freedom, with a promise to become a longer story, for better or worse (there's ""Untitled Rebel Moon Prequel"" TV series entry on IMDB).So it's not that bad.Bit it's not very good, either. For some reason the actors' work in the second part looks weaker, save for the main heroine - her fight scenes still look amazing. Also there's no real story being told, neither about the world, nor character's past, nor future - it's all generic ""we fight for freedom"". And so is almost everything, secondary and generic and lacking the originality: genius tactical general running towards enemy hordes without cover, unexplained and misplaced steampunk aesthetics, incoherent technology that is both unoriginal and unrealistic at the same time. There were a bright flashes of originality like costumes of Tarzan-looking-prince's court, or the imperial healers, or... no I think that's about it.I guess it wouldn't be fair to call it an epic version of a fireplace videos - there's a lot of work being put into this movie - but next big thing in sci-fi universes it's definitely not.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

One feels that the universe and its characters are fully realized, Their wants and motivations are fully realized with minimal but the right touch of wry humor underneath especially from one of my favorite characters, the noble prince Tarak.The action is actually a step up on a a more creative level than than other Snyder works and keeps. Building with new elements. The villain is only as good as its hero, skrein and boutella deliver very reciting performances as two characters on opposite sides of the coin with them being soldier killing machines , one who broke free and one trapped by orders of their superiors.The music is also more heroic and compliments the musical cues derived from the previous entry, these pg 13 cuts are best viewed as one movie for the general audience, it is a grand epic on operatic sci-fi level, while it may seem like a story told before, Snyder puts enough new elements that mine new things in the genre. Yes the hype is real, part 2 is better than a child of fire (which I gave it a 8.3/10) but part 2 pays off most things in part 1 that it should be viewed as one cohesive whole by general masses to get the most enjoyment.","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

The acting was on the level of the old Power Ranger shows. I wasn't a huge fan of the first movie but it was okay for killing some time. Figured this would be at least on the same level because the first film seemed to really be pushing towards the follow up story. As if the first was more of just a prequel.

I mean, even without all the slow motion and the music, the pacing would be atrocious.I don't think the main story was too much of a problem, if only it was told in a good way. The problem is more that the people I'm supposed to care about are hardly familiar to me after having watched both parts of the story.The thing is that the two movies should have been one only. Maybe someone with too much free time can recut the two parts into one half-decent movie, no longer than a couple of hours. If so, please put some better music to it (if the dialog is canceled by this, no one will mind) and cut the most of the slow motion or at least speed it up. All the exposition can be ported to a Wikipedia article.

Also the film spends some exposition on some of these characters on why they are motivated in defending them.

It is the second part of the copy-paste Star Wars from Ali Express and the characters remains almost funny, while they actually tell their story - one at the time and make another ferry to die and another viewer to fall asleep. Yeah.... he totally lost it. This is the stage at his career that he can allow himself to be out of tune, but not like that, never like that.The plot doesn't exist. The characters are a joke and the Baddy...well...he tries to be fine, but its like a pile of crap covers everything, so even Ed Skrein gets buried under all of that. The super slow motions are just too much and demonstrate where Snyder's career stands, almost drowning in the depth of the mud.Its like Snyder is expecting us to ignore each and every plot hole that exists in his movie and begs us to wait and stay to see the main movie headline - the Indiscriminate shooting of the good guys against the baddies. Ridiculous even for kids and just bad storytelling and none of the action long sequences will save this movie from getting trashed, as it deserves.Once again, we have ""Seven Samurais"" meet ""Star Wars"", but If you want to go to a better place with that mix, you can easily find it at the next streaming giant - it is called ""The Mandalorian"" and it was damn good. No reason for the plot, no interest in the main characters and even in the special effects category (Super and Extras Slow motions don't cut it alone, anymore) - Snyder Losses. Please Make it stop and don't go to another one.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I gave snyder the benefit of the doubt, thinking the 2nd part would be epic. This movie is really bad unfortunately. The acting is hit or miss. Thr story is all but a miss. The only redeeming quality, is some action sequences. But overall, it was a horrible experience. I can see the light now Snyder. You had me fooled for sure.The real problem is the lackadaisical story telling. I'm thinking Kora is gonna have a cool little backstory of being betrayed by her father. That was an utter failure. The sene itself was constructed very poorly. In my opinion, that doomed the movie. Who cares when your main characters backstory is goofy. Now, I don't even want to see the directors cuts.

Diving back into the tumultuous galaxy far, far away from originality, director Zack Snyder pushes forward with a sequel that not only stumbles but spectacularly falls face-first into a black hole of incoherence. The movie picks up where the first left off, yet somehow, viewers may find themselves even more lost in space. The plot, or the lack thereof, zigzags through a minefield of flashbacks that manage to subtract rather than add any substantial narrative. Two movies into the saga, and the audience is still scavenging for a plot amidst the rubble of recycled scenes.Ironically, ""Rebel Moon"" seems to orbit too closely around its more famous cousin, Star Wars, borrowing heavily from its character roster and story arcs but without any of the charm or wit. The dialogue toggles between painfully clichéd and mind-bogglingly nonsensical, leaving one to wonder if the script was perhaps written by a committee of confused droids. The characters are so reminiscent of those from a galaxy far, far away that you half expect a credit scene revealing it was all just a fan fiction from a parallel universe. This sequel not only fails to eclipse its predecessor, which was no stellar feat itself, but plunges into a new low with a concoction of sloppy storytelling and déjà vu inducing motifs.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Putting fake grain and noise on digital video is a creative pestilence that has gotten out of hand today, with a recent example being Fallout. Instead Snyder gives us a clean high definition modern image that looks fantastic (if you disregard the typical Snyder overuse of slow motion). Not even Nolans movies, shot on real film, have the amount of grain that we see nowadays.

I suspect the origin of Zack's Rebel Moon goes back to the 1990s and is his reaction to a narrative hole in the Star Wars films. WE all liked the Death Star blown up; we all liked the teddy bears taking down the Empire's walkers; and yet, no Star Wars movie offers a decisive ground-air combat win for eh rebel alliance. Rebel Moon, especially part 2 is the missing film.Given that's the good news, it's easy to turn this around and say, ""Nothing new here, same old, same old."" I can see tha tpoint of view too. I still give it a 9/10 because both parts one and two are made with a whole hell of a lot of heart and good morale. As with many films running on familiar TV and movie tropes, they can still be good entertainment based on execution (like Wednesday and Heart of Stone on Netflix).For comparison consider Argyle, made by Matthew Vaughn for Apple TV. I saw it in a theater because like the first two Kingsmen so much. However here we have a genuinely bad movie, based on on familiar TV and movie tropes, which even terrific execution could not save. All the sizzle is in the two minute trailer.","8 out of 22 found this helpful.

In this case it was coal smoke billowing out of what was supposed to be a version of an Imperial walker, and I dubbed this the child of Star Wars and Wild Wild West. In a scene on the main ship we have coal fires and tenders. The first half is dogged with backstory that had me looking up from my iPad periodically. The dialogue is such that your chances of predicting lines is up there. The battles all slow down so you can see the choreography. I assume most of the budget went for cgi as the best known actor is Djimon Hounsou, who isn't bad with the little he gets to do.

I also read the negative reviews of the second part so I was sort of biased to believe that the whole thing has a serious lack of quality. I must admit that was proven wrong after watching the second part. I am not saying that this is a masterpiece, but I would easily rate it with 7 out of 10, and I am actually looking forward for the continuation, experiencing how her story evolves. I am giving a 10 out of 10 rating, as a protest against the negativity of the user reviews, as well as the reviews from experts. This is a streaming movie, if this was a masterpiece, it would hit the theaters instead. Since it is not, we should treat it as such. I am not a big fan of Snyder in general, but if I am to evaluate this as a streaming platform movie, because that what this is, he has actually done quite decent work. I therefore, highly recommend watching both parts.","9 out of 26 found this helpful.

No? Well, it's called ""Rebel Moon."" One can't help seeing ripoffs from a lot of good movies and shows: GOTs, Star Wars, Conan the Barbarian, the Mandalorian, Lord of the Rings and the WWII German-esque uniforms from Starship Troopers, just to name a few. That, and throw in some plain folk Mennonite farmers for flavor. It's an ok movie, but as Yogi Bera said, ""it's like deja vu all over again,"" and that makes ""Rebel Moon"" predictable and forgettable. Moreover, the acting, which is often over-emotive, is at times laughable instead of what it is attempting to be, and that is stirring. If you have nothing better to watch and like SciFi, you can find things to like In ""Rebel Moon."" Otherwise, this film gets a ""meh"" and a huge yawn.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I have a feeling these directors cuts will be released and have people asking ""why didn't we get these versions originally?"". I understand the studios butchered his past visions but he had ultimate control here. He made a choice to release the same type of garbage studios have been for years just because he could? He eliminated almost everyone's desire to see them by releasing 2 dumpster fires first.

During ""laser"" shootout moments, these flares cover practically the entire screen. The color palette remains very dull, and except for a couple of shots, it can be summarized as insipid or, in the most extreme cases, horrendous. The special effects are not as noticeable as in the Part 1, but they're not remarkable either.As in the first part, the dialogue and script are dismal, constantly teetering on the brink of cringe and incoherence. This isn't helped by the poor staging, where Snyder can't find a better way to present exposition than through a mediocre scene where characters sit and recount their past as if reading it from Wikipedia. Or presenting deaths or dramatic moments in a bland manner, incapable of conveying anything to the audience, pretending that putting dramatic music over the scene compensates for the poor dialogue, performances, and cinematography.Continuing with the performances, they're flat, partly due to both the actors and the script. Practically every character has barely enough lines for their voices to be heard. Snyder prefers to invest footage of his film in trivial slow-motion scenes of wheat harvesting rather than showing us interactions between his characters that allow us to connect with them. The case of Anthony Hopkins is especially lamentable; bringing an actor of his caliber to perform in such a poor role is a complete waste of talent.The only thing that is partially redeemable is the soundtrack. Junkie XL does a good job, although not exceptional, and it's far from his other works.This film is more action-packed, at least in its second half, after a tedious introduction that doesn't really contribute as much to the plot as it could have. This helps to better handle the pace compared to Part 1, and perhaps this is the reason why I can't place this second part in a worse position than its predecessor. The film has great action sequences, especially towards the end, mixed with others that are more disorganized, but they all suffer from the same problem: a complete lack of emotion, as there is never any tension or the feeling that the heroes might not win.The film overall is quite predictable, uninspired, boring, and clumsy. There's really not much to salvage from this franchise attempt.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

So if you don't like Snyder, there's a simple solution. STOP... WATCHING... HIS FILMS! Why waste your time on something you'll undoubtedly hate?Now is Snyder, a master filmmaker, no, but his style is fun and unique. The man is a solid director.Anyway...Rebel Moon - Part Two: The Scargiver continues and builds off of what Part One does. The story is good. The character development is great. Showing us these characters' backstories... and by the way showing not telling.Every characters motivation and reasoning for being there is put on full display. I cared about these characters and their well-being. However, I do wish James would have been shown and explained more. The script is well written, the action is phenomenal, the cast delivers great performances, the cinematography, the cgi is amazing, and the films original score is fantastic.Snyder wasted no time in getting straight to the point. This film is basically nonstop action from beginning to end. Then everything pays off in a tense third act. The anticipation from Part One and build-up to this battle was greatly satisfying.I am invested in this universe and hope Snyder gets a chance to do more. Until then, bring on the Snyder Cuts.IMDb: 8/10

Any good.Does it build upon (improve upon?) part 1...? Or does it double down and end being all style no substance......Yeah.It's the latterLike all Zack Snyder movies,Echoes of a recovering garth vader chamberSpace age julious cesar killing bitWooden dialogue.... Lots of flashback with narration for each character...literally a scene (collection of scenes) where the characters sit around a dinner table and give narrate their own flashback sequence)They say show don't tell.... Zack snyder does both...
He shows... AND he tells...He should stick with just showing... I don't thing his strengths lie in writing.... I think he's a fantastic, visually stylistic director.... But his best work comes when he's working from a script he didn't write himself...Link to slomo guys video with snyder, tag em...The final battle... Kinda felt rushed and... Unearned... Like the hero momet... Feels like it came outta nowhere (in guessing it'll be better set up in the directors cut.... Like. BVS)acting is fine......Ed Skrein does a lot with the little he's given..... (especially considering he was only cast like 10 days before he was filming his first scene)Sophia Botella, just doesn't seem to have that IT factor to make here a leading lady.The supporting cast (Djimon Honsou, Michael Huisman etc...) all try there best.... But with the dialogue they're given..... Only so much they can do...The cross cutting in the 3rd act between the space battle.... The ground battle and the fight on the ship... Very remeniscant of star wars....There's a very cool, stylised fight scene with energy swords (totally not light sabers) that's a mash up of return or the jedi, inception and watchmen...... I have to say that scene was very cool....But... That's about the only thing I enjoyed about rebel moon 2...Rebel fleet, evil space soldiers, laser energy swords....small farming planets... Androids with British accents....Yeah... Totally not a star wars movie.... 😉Robots are called Jimmys....so.... I'll take that as a compliment 😉4/10 for rebel moon part 2: The Scargiver.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"5","/10","The Epic in Slow Motion by Snyder.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9745919/?ref_=tt_urv","saolivaresm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur132357199/?ref_=tt_urv","20 April 2024","Directed by Zack Snyder and starring Sofia Boutella, Ed Skrein, Djimon Hounsou, Michiel Huisman, Bae Doona and Ray Fisher.SynopsisThe rebels prepare to fight Motherworld as unbreakable bonds are forged, new heroes emerge, and legends are created.One cannot deny that Zack Snyder is one of the directors who puts the most enthusiasm into what he does and it is always appreciated that he proposes new things in the industry, even though it is often not the result everyone expects.The ambition that he achieves in his own battle of the galaxies called Rebel Moon has two sides to take as a counterpart. You may like her or you may hate her, but she will not leave you indifferent to what the director proposes to us once again. In my case, I am left with the feeling that I had a pleasant moment in front of the screen despite the shortcomings that the film offers, but Zack Snyder's cunning or habit of occupying the camera manages to make a story that does not advance in In no sense do its slow motions turn it into something much more amazing than what the final result ends up being.It certainly doesn't surpass its first installment and feels like more of the same as what we saw in its first part. With that, we are left with the feeling of waiting for something new to be proposed to us by the director and well, in my opinion he achieves it with one of his best characters in the story such as James, but unfortunately we really see little of him, but when he is on screen is the moment when the film achieves its greatest peak in fun. The rest is a film that continues to give us flat characters and a protagonist who is difficult to get attached to, even though we have an excellent performance by Sofia Boutella, giving herself completely to her role.The great deficit that Rebel Moon has in its central core is that it is difficult to really empathize with its characters and with a story that remains stuck in the same thing and halfway through the film one even comes to feel that they are stuck in the same circle. Despite everything mentioned, the film manages to attract your attention and you do not abandon it along the way, managing to have a much more striking climax and where Snyder's camera skills are allowed to show off much more even though his excess of slow motion is the true seal of everything that Rebel Moon hides.Zack Snyder knows how to visually construct the ideas of his final battle well and makes his budget work correctly, something that one can always highlight from the director who knows how to invest very well with what he has at his disposal. Correct CGI and understandable handling of the action sequences allow the film to visually catch your attention and leave aside a script that lost its surprise a while ago.Netflix bet big with a blockbuster that is in the middle line of a proposal that you can see once in your life and continue with it without having changed anything of what was planned. It is a film that has moments and that serve to prevent it from being a complete disaster and we are left with an acceptable and correct film to position itself as a blockbuster for Netflix and for the Snyderverse.Don't expect to find the best film of the year or the best of the director, but a weekend pastime without high expectations.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Why so much!The whole movie could be 30 minutes shorter if there was no slow-mo and if there are any slow-motion scenes, make sure the right stuff is slowed down. I understand slowing down scenes can add a thrilling element and it allows the graphic department to show what they can do with modern graphics but come on.The story is as thin as tin foil. The acting is so-so, the effects are actually decent (when not unnecessarily slowed down) and the story...

Society has become far too lazy with the attention span of a fruit fly to enjoy a movie that requires time to develop its story and characters. This story does just that. This second movie ended in a way that would lead one to believe more is coming. I truly hope so. I would love to see how this group of characters works together to take the fight to the enemy.

Some of them don't seem to get the story or the main point at all. It is NOT about the grain. It is about Power, Betrayal. Simple as that. Fresh take on Star Wars and Dune but different storyline and different universe.I totally get it. Action and story, all balanced. Great acting from main characters. OK slow mo, it is not over used and only a few parts and actually it is good at the right scene. I couldn't believe I was emotional at the end and so piss off at the Balisarius for all the wrong and pain that he has caused on so many worlds. Poor Kora had suffered enough already and let her be.The first one gave you brief story behind what was happening. Kora seeked a few heroes to help with the rebellion. Part 2 gave you more details and brief background on each hero. Then action, the fight, unexpected help and turn of event. It's truly entertaining and never a dull moment. I have watched second time and still enjoying it. I hope they made the third one where Kora kill her adopted dad and found the princess to restore the peace.Seriously, it is a great story and if you keep an open mind, you should enjoy this movie. I have seen so many movies, TV series, all genres and I have thousand of movie collection. I know what a bad movie or story look like but this is NOT a bad movie. It is one of the BEST Sci Fi movie. I love Star Wars, Star Trek and Dune. This will sit among them under Sci Fi category.","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

The cinematography is a work of Art, so many different shots I felt I was looking at a beautiful enriched detail picture in an Art Gallery. Sofia Boutella is a Movie Star, such a great performance from her throughout the entire film & man what a show she put on in the final act. Ed Skrein embodied the villain role, every time he was on screen you felt his dominating presence & you're just waiting to see him do something destructive. Djimon Hounsou, hats off & round of applause! He's character General Titus is such a Soulful Worrier, I would go into any battle under his leadership & believe we would have Victory. Anthony Hopkins's voiced character Jimmy is a complexed character where I see there's so much more to explore & showcase as a sentient Artificial Intelligence, that's in assistance with Humans. In closing, it was a nice touch to see Cleopatra Coleman's beautiful character Devra Bloodaxe come in for the Victory Lap, I would like to see a spin off series on the Bloodaxes. Tom Holkenborg rocks it again with the intense & beautiful Score, further establishing his catalog beside the great Hans Zimmer. Thank you to everyone involved in creating this Epic Case Study Film, definitely one for The Ages.","35 out of 149 found this helpful.

Let's give credit where it's due and enjoy the film for what it is-a fun ride with its own charm.Just to say, I certainly found enjoyment in that regard. Being a Zack Snyder fan might have influenced my perspective, but I also believe the cast was excellently chosen.I'm already looking forward to the third film. If it has even half as much action and stunning special effects, I'll be satisfied.

I liked the first one and this was a solid follow up. The world building was seen a little more clearly in this too. So if the main characters stick together I hope that in the next movie they get out more into space. I mean come on!!! Give me another movie from this year or last that checks off everything a sci-fi fan wants. All I see are people complaining about the same things. It is just people playing follow the leader. They are not taking in the material and judging it on what is there. Just a bunch of people saying the first one sucked, it did not, and following up with this one is worse, it is not. I would have enjoyed the two together initially even though that would have been a long movie. I won't give a spoiler but that one flashback seeing where the main character went ""wrong"" really set the next phase up well. I hope we get to see the real big bad in the next movie. I would watch several more of these. I think considering Snyder's history these are some of his best work since Watchmen.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

But only if you judge it by the standards of a movie.However, if we change the optics, we could enjoy it.It is very much like an ancient heroic epos. Strange and sometimes absurd dialogues like those in Odyssey by Homer. Strange motivations of the heroes like in Beowulf or The Song of Roland. I am sure if Homer could make a movie based on his Illiad, there would have been a lot of slow motion scenes.Of course, the script is super primitive, but it is like in operas or in ballets. Only a formality to help the author to demonstrate what he really wants to. In the case of Snyder, surely its visual component. And visually this movie is superb! Aesthetics is so cool!You must fast forward the most cringe moments, but overall it is an interesting experiment.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

This is a ""Star Wars"" that Kathleen Kennedy and her minions could never make. This is a masterpiece of the genre - and I NEVER say that about anything. Sofia B. Makes a decent enough protag but Ed Skrein as Atticus Noble makes a deliciously evil villain, even more so in this outing. But let's go back to Zach for a moment. This film shows you the potential that can be realized when you let an A-list personality produce, write, direct, and do the cinematography for an action/adventure film. Few have tried, and most fail, but Zach scores big here. And the final five minutes set the stage for what the Part 3 story would be, so here's to hoping Netflix does the Right Thing by Greenlighting it!","8 out of 29 found this helpful.

I'll admit that even though i enjoyed part 1, I did think it was a bit rushed and I looked forward to the r rated version but with Rebel Moon part 2: The Scargiver that was not the case at all. This film delivered on all aspects. Reveling the characters past allows u to connect emotionally to each one in a way the first lacked. Zack has said he wrote these as a single film and i wish they would have released it as one film. With saying that, even as 2 films The Scargiver stands alone perfectly. The build up to the climax brings u in close and allows you to work and become a part of the village. The actors in this film prove that they are not just bodies for the action sequences but people who could be your neighbors on a distant planet. Zacks use of slow motion not only makes for the best action scenes you have ever seen but also allows you to see the beauty of everyday life in the village. The climaxs tempo has your heart pounding and keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next. Ive never been so into a battle sequence, probably because in other films u already know or have a good idea of the outcome. The ups and downs and ups and downs of this section of the film had me worried for the characters at every moment. The final fight was one of the best I've ever seen in a film. Perfectly choreographed with camera angles that make u feel like you're right there with the characters. Even though it is a fight sequence, every frame is visually magnificent. Something I love about Snyders work is that at any moment u can pause the film and the visual aspect is so gorgeous that you could print it to canvas and hang it on your wall and Rebel Moon part 2: The Scargiver doubles down on this with breath taking visuals for the entirety of the film. I still look forward to the r rated versions but I have no idea what they can add to Rebel Moon part 2: The Scargiver to make it any better. Two thumbs way up for Zack Snyder and Netflix! I look forward to more films from this universe!","6 out of 20 found this helpful.

I liked it!It's not Shogun, but then it shouldn't be. Or should it have been several long episodes? Who knows? Now it stands alone. The characters are interesting, and I think an episodic series would let us know more about their wounds.As is, there is a bucolic but endearing long harvest scene. The land is the star: the land anchors this disparate set of orphans in a single set piece, a goal of choice. Isn't that Freedom?The cinematography is really gorgeous, especially on the practicals. The village, over watched by Jimmy, is a beacon that draws friend and foe. To the imperium, it represents dissent. To the fighters, it represent all they've lost in other places. The sense of place is very strong. The even show highlights each protagonist in a wonderful pre-industrial way, while the antagonists are intent on delivering hellish destruction with atomics and weapons that destroy with magma.Kora is a lightly drawn character, and Sofia draws her out in deft touches and intensity. Admiral Noble isn't, and the character is over the top, maybe the only mismatch on the film's delivery. General Titus has the same nobility that Djimon Hounsou always carries. He sings a haunting song after dinner in another language, making it all the more longing. The young girl steals everyone's heart with her hopeful naivety. And it works.I'll leave the rest of the story to your watching. It drew me in, I think because I listened as intently as I watched. The movie deserves a nuanced watch, looking for connections and unspoken communications.There's enough criticism to go around. I watched it for the storytelling, and I got it. I hope you do too.PS- embrace the Buck Rogers/Flash Gordon appearances. They're almost quaint, like steam punk!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

We watched it right after the first one. I'm very happy they made a sequel, as it would've been far too rushed as a single film. I still feel this would make an amazing tv series, video game, or anime, as it would give more time to flesh out the characters. I would adore a book, too. As is, I really truly enjoyed it, especially the Samurai Seven parallels. I highly recommend giving it a shot, and like someone else said in a review, if you aren't the Simpsons comic book guy, you'll enjoy this. Many seem to think that simply because it occurs in space, it's a ripoff of a certain popular movies series, and I find that take extremely ignorant.

This is a heartfelt, rousing space opera that isn't so much heavy on grand ideas as it is grand spectacle, with an almost space western by way of Roman epic through-line as several disparate characters from many corners of the universe do battle with a vicious fascist regime, resplendent with the spatially satisfying slow motion choreography that Snyder adores indulging in (its kinda like Paul Greengrass and his relentless shaky cam; it's either your thing, or it vehemently ain't), stirring emotional musical score from Tom Holkenborg and fun, spirited performances from a game cast of welcome faces like Djimon Hounsou, Cary Elwes, Doona Bae, Ed Skrein, the soulful vocal pipes of Anthony Hopkins, Michiel Huisman, Staz Nair and our angularly lithe main character, Sofia Boutella. Now, the elephant in the room. Snyder is a terrific artist who has never made a bad film, and it's time for all the Mountain Dew chugging basement dwellers to just accept it... and move on. This is a fun, visually dazzling piece of pulp science fiction with nothing too much on its mind other than a Magnificent Seven In The Stars type storyline, here to entertain us and nothing more. In that respect it does a damn fine job, presenting us a world teeming with world building detail, cathartic incident and musical swells accenting it all royally. It's good fun, so man up and deal with it.","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

I kinda feel it's up to everyone if they wanna watch both versions of the directors cut, versus the shorter PG cuts. For me it's like getting 4 films for the price of one. Sure it's sly business strategy, but it's what got the film greenlit. And I don't see certain films seeing the light of the day without these financing choices these days. I enjoyed part 1 and 2, but I know I will review the directors cuts differently. For a streaming film, this is of cinematic quality, watch it on a big screen or home projector.

I've seen all the Star Wars movies and they have become less interesting and more desparate as time goes on (Force Awakens brings back Luke, Han, and Leia come on).Rebel Moon is a refreshing sci-fi action movie. The effects of the guns, explosions, and energy swords are amazing and highly entertaining. The contrast of the simplicity and smallness of the settlement of Veldt to the shear magnitude and bruteness of the Motherworld is captivating. The choreography is fluid, doesn't seem like a bunch of random fighting scenes like a lot of other movies in this genre.Oh the reviewers that think this is all about WHEAT are missing the big picture. This is about power, and the dynamics of how fragile that power can be. If people stop submitting to power and put up a resistance things can change. In this film the Motherworld needs the resources from Veldt and all the other planets they dominate in order to function.","4 out of 16 found this helpful.

However, this sequel has more than made up for its predecessor's shortcomings, and I enjoyed it immensely. Instead of two separate films, Zack should have made a 3+ hours-long movie.Despite the predictable story, it still manages to captivate me. The characters' backstories are well-developed, giving them a strong motivation to fight for Veldt. However, the robot ""James"" lacks any meaningful arc explaining his peculiar attire. Nonetheless, his presence as a spectator over the village reminded me of Ephialtes from 300 and as a superhero during the battle.Zack's slow-motion effects may be slightly overused and the cinematography is decent in comparison to his other works.In my opinion, if Lucasfilm had allowed Zack to make these films under the Star Wars franchise, they would have been better spin-offs. There would have been no need to waste time creating worlds and cultures for this story to be made as films.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and would recommend it without hesitation. I'm eagerly anticipating seeing it become a franchise.Ratings for this movie seems unfair.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

It has great characters, great action, stunning visuals, and just about everything a syfy action movie needs.Thing is though, these movies aren't complete. Zack Snyder was given the freedom to make PG-13 cuts (per Netflix's request) and his R-rated director cuts at the same time. There is still 2 hours of story yet to be seen, and Snyder has said himself, the tone, order, and takes will be different in the Snydercuts.When they drop this summer, you will finally get to see the story as Snyder intended. Most people that are complaining just talk trash but have no logic for backing it up.If the PG-13 versions feel like they're missing something, that's because they are. And all will be told and fulfilled this summer.All critics and reviewers, myself included, give their opinion on the movie, but IT DOESN'T MAKE THEM RIGHT. It's all a matter of opinion, and to me, the critics and the Star Wars funboy's opinions do not matter.","3 out of 14 found this helpful.

While yes you can say some aspects are/have been done, that does not make them any less enjoyable to watch. Remember that if you look back all stories are just the retelling of those before. It's the way it is portrayed that is what shines through. These movies have had beautiful overarching narratives of family, faith, unity, and overcoming our pasts and failures that touches to the heart if who we are. I truly hope that this is a series that continues to grow and we are able to join in for an epic journey of growth of both person and cause. Excited to see what comes next!","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Iconic World War I World War II meet Star Wars. Great acting. Zack you hit all the spots and the CGI was amazing. I can't imagine any sci-fi buff or action adventure buff not enjoying number one but very much number two. Cannot wait for number three. This is a whole believable world that makes sense. Characters die and characters live on as it should be in a Trilogy or Anthology whichever it may end up being. Please make the third one at least. We need it. We need Cora she is amazing and I will be a fan of hers the rest of her career. Anybody who did not enjoy this needs to watch it again.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

In fact I thought is was better then the first part. Looking to see more. The acting was real good, I don't see why people are giving it such bad reviews. Sophia is bad ass in this movie, she really kicks ass. And Ed of course is a great actor and did his job didn't skip a beat. Hope to see more of him. For having such bad reviews, it sure is the number one movie right now on Netflix. The movie is fun to watch, and very different. Action from start to finish. And did not know the robot was HANNIBAL LOL !! But over all is a nice action family movie.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

The villains appear to be Nazis even from the way they dress and behave, especially the leader. On the contrary, the good ones are reminiscent of the partisans even in their humble clothing typical of those poor times. And exactly as then, they had no other choice but to fight against an implacable and unstoppable enemy who wanted to enslave them by denying them EVERYTHING.What really struck me about this film is the acting of the actors, which is really well done and realistic, a rare thing to see in movies nowadays. Then also the plot, action, fights and special effects were good.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

Zack Snyder's signature style is unmistakable, with each frame brimming with his unique blend of grandiose spectacle and intimate character moments.Fans of ""Star Wars"" and ""300"" will find plenty to appreciate here, as Snyder deftly weaves familiar motifs and aesthetics from these iconic films into the fabric of ""Rebel Moon 2."" The result is a thrilling ride that feels both fresh and nostalgically reverent.As the credits roll, the anticipation for a third installment is palpable. With the groundwork laid for an even more expansive universe, the saga of ""Rebel Moon"" is poised to become a new cornerstone of sci-fi cinema. Here's to hoping that part 3, when announced, will take us to even greater heights.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

First, where did all that grand food come from? Not those poor hungry farmers. Excellent, sex within the first twelve minutes of the movie. And is this a future version of Magnificent Seven? Yep. With hints of Gladiator, again. Yep. Everyone is having a grand time before they get annihilated in five days. But the way the script goes, it's five months. Just so much stupid, inconsistent stuff. Lousy script... Again. Acting was okay. CGI was fantastic, as with all Sci-Fi movies with a decent budget. This will not get an Academy Award nomination for best costumes, maybe a Razzie.""Oh, look, damn... They showed up""... We've seen this script at least a thousand times. Nothing new, nothing exciting, nothing exceptional. Just below average crap.Thank you for your time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
