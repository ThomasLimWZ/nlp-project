"7","/10","Nice easy to watch adventure movie.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7483472/?ref_=tt_urv","deloudelouvain","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur58525162/?ref_=tt_urv","26 October 2021","If you like adventure movies like Indiana Jones, Romancing The Stone, Jewel Of The Nile, Jumanji and others in this genre you can't go wrong with Jungle Cruise. It's the same entertainment, a bit over the top, not always making sense, but that's hardly the point with these kind of movies. It's just a bit of fun. To me it's very relaxing to watch these kind of popcorn movies. The Rock or Dwayne Johnson might not be the greatest actor but I think he fits in this genre. He's okay to watch in non serious movies. Emily Blunt did a good job as well as did the rest of the cast. The CGI's were more than decent, they clearly had a big budget for these parts in the movie. Jungle Cruise is perfect to watch as a family movie or if you're just a big fan of easy adventure.","54 out of 72 found this helpful.

As always chemistry is on point with whatever actor she teams up with and Johnson is no exception. It is mostly fun but the story is iffy and yes there is memories of Pirates and The Mummy all throughout. The rating here on IMDb is pretty much spot on, audience on RT has inflated it to over 90 which it is not. Just have fun with it. I feel like the sequel which they have announced will be just a money grab. I won't be in a rush to see it.","31 out of 42 found this helpful.

A down on his luck river boat captain who takes tourists for a ride in the Amazon.He is hired by adventurer Lily (Emily Blunt) and her uptight brother MacGregor Houghton (Jack Whitehall) who are on the search for the Tears of the Moon. The petals of a tree of life that can cure any illness. The Spanish were in search for it about 400 years earlier.Set in 1916, Lily finds that German Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons) is also in pursuit at a time when the nations are at war. However Lily finds that Frank is a man who is hard to trust and he is full of cheesy jokes.This comedy adventure is a mish mash of previous movies. I found it more Romancing the Stone mixed with the Brendan Fraser The Mummy movies. There is also a hint of the Pirate of the Caribbean franchise.It harks back to two decades earlier when Disney were adapting their theme park rides rather than superhero movies or remaking their old cartoons as live action films.Jungle Cruise is a colourful romp that lacks originality.","46 out of 71 found this helpful.

The action was great, well worth experiencing this on the big screen as I did. Only issue was the plot is very repetitive as in they need to find something that will help everyone etc, we've seen it in heaps of other films, so nothing special plot wise. I did see many resemblances to films such as raiders of the lost ark and the first pirates of the Caribbean film, which were great films to base ideas off of for this film around many aspects such as the adventure side of the film and the comedy. Overall it was an exciting and funny big screen adventure.","134 out of 236 found this helpful.

Dwayne Johnson is as charming as ever, and assisting him are the company of Emily Blunt and Jack Whitehall. Blunt has been apparently finding her path in Hollywood with well-crafted popcorn entertainment and more thoughtful films like A Quiet Place; I certainly hope she continues to go down this path of success.By the way, if Metallica was going to license 'Nothing Else Matters' to any composer to cover it for a Disney picture, Jungle Cruise definitely makes the most sense.Grade- 3/4 stars.","50 out of 73 found this helpful.

The story zips along pleasantly enough, delivering all the necessary action as it does so and, before you know it, two hours have passed agreeably enough. And that's about it, really...You can't help but enjoy everything while it's happening but, once done, there's not an awful lot left on the bones to pick over. Hollywood being what it is, I'm sure a sequel is in the works. There really shouldn't be. They just barely managed to make this initial movie work, trying to repeat that process will, on the evidence of what we have here, be a very risky endeavour. Leave well alone and move on to the next Disneyland attraction would be my advice. Jason Statham in It's A Small World, anyone...?Kudos, by the way, for the excellent use of Metallica's ""Nothing Else Matters""....","98 out of 171 found this helpful.

Dwayne Johnson plays Frank, a steamboat captain who resembles Humphrey Bogart, which I believe was done purposefully. The story and settings made me think of a movie mashup of Jumanji and Pirates of the Caribbean. The only thing missing was Johnny Depp, but with his current legal issues, he may not be in too many Disney films going forward. Time will tell.However, for a film based on a theme park ride, Jungle Cruise is right up there with the original Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl. It was a fun watch, hardly ever boring. On another note though, the acting could have been better. It felt as though Emily Blunt was just phoning in her lines, like she really didn't care. Johnson, I felt out acted her. Disney has a winner on their hands with Jungle Cruise, but hopefully they won't overdo it with umpteen sequels!","37 out of 53 found this helpful.

The director is Jaume Collet-Serra, who directed many entertaining Liam Neeson action flicks. Glad to say, the direction is gorgeous here.Despite being type-casted, Dwayne Johnson gives a very likable and charming performance. His character and Emily Blunt's scientist character is the best aspect of Jungle Cruise. Their chemistry is very enjoyable.Now there are some dumb Disney jokes, obviously for younger audience to have fun. The jokes are mostly presented by the comic relief character, McGregor.The three main cast work well, but unfortunately not the villains. There are 2 groups of villains, one is the Germans, the other one is some supernatural trope of people. Why can't there just be one?The film asks you to believe a lot of things. There's a certain thing explored about a character in the 2nd act that just didn't work for me. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.The movie at times feel like a Disney ride, which is its source material. Jungle Cruise is perfect for people who want a CGI-filled fun ride.","112 out of 201 found this helpful.

I think he is very well-cut, pardon the pun, for the adventure movie genre.And he doesn't disappoint in ""Jungle Cruise"", let me just say that right away. Yup, he is so well-cast for this movie and really carries it phenomenally with his performance and that particular character.The storyline told in ""Jungle Cruise"", as written by Michael Green, Glenn Ficarra, John Requa, John Norville, Josh Goldstein and Glenn Ficarra definitely was a very entertaining one. And it was the type of storyline that quickly picks you up from the very beginning and takes you along with it for quite the thrill ride throughout the jungle. I was expecting it to be good, but I must admit that the story actually turned out to be way more interesting and detailed than I had anticipated.Visually then ""Jungle Cruise"" is just spectacular. The jungle really offers a lot to look at, and just makes for a grand setting for the movie. But also things like the wardrobe, props, etc. Were really spot on and very detailed, adding a lot to the movie.The CGI in the movie was good, but of course with this being Disney, why wouldn't it be? And the jaguar pet really was a nice touch to the movie.""Jungle Cruise"" definitely has a good cast. Of course
Dwayne Johnson is the main attraction and he carries the movie so wonderfully. I wasn't initially thrilled about it being Emily Blunt to co-star alongside
Dwayne Johnson, but she really put on a great performance and I liked her in this movie. It was really nice to see Paul Giamatti in the movie, and he had a wonderful character here, just a shame that he wasn't given more on-screen time.If you get the chance to watch director Jaume Collet-Serra's ""Jungle Cruise"", you must do so. Especially if you enjoy family movies and adventure movies. So if you enjoyed movies like ""The Goonies"", ""Indiana Jones"", ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"", etc. Then you most certainly will also enjoy ""Jungle Cruise"".This is a movie that I can warmly recommend you sit down to watch.I am rating ""Jungle Cruise"" a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.","114 out of 211 found this helpful.

So Collett-Serra serves us another theme park attraction movie that repeats the familiar formula of action, humour and romance. Sure, Jungle Cruise is ""entertaining"", but the lack of originality grows boring. It's all been seen elsewhere and better. We basically get the fan-fiction version a la Pirates of the Caribbean films with a slightly different makeover. Or, to put it more wickedly, a moldy Indiana Jones knock-off. Despite millions of dollars worth of special effects in virtually every scene, the film fails to work any real cinematic magic. This isn't even annoying, it just doesn't matter at all. Movie making at its safest, laziest and most unimaginative.","4 out of 4 found this helpful.

Meaning -things like- you're just going to get the 'Same old', run-of-the-mill American Accent from him yet again, despite him playing the role of, get this, a -Spaniard- . . .

So anyways, I'm just going to recommend that you go to the cinema -{ Expecting }- to see him put in a ""Thorough & Dedicated Performance"", with a few ""impressive"" surprises sprinkled into the mix, for what it's worth. And inasmuchas the sister-brother duo of Emily Blunt's 'Lily Houghton' & Jack Whitehall's 'MacGregor Houghton' are concerned, ready yourself for an incredibly -{ FUN }- journey with these two effusive, ""Mega-Talented Stars"" and veterans of the Film and Telivision business, ( respectively ). In the "" nascently Post-Victorian 🎩 "" setting of JC, you are likely to find these two characters to be -Nothing- less than sheerly Affable, Charming, & Indeed Just, "" All Around . . . . DELIGHTFUL "".3. ""Jesse Lon Plemmons"" Was The Marvellous ""Shock"" : of this huge, exciting movie { well for -Me- ateast, that is to say }. He portrays the Tyrannically-Monstrous German ""Prince Joachim : your worst nightmare straight outta World War 1"" in Jungle Cruise ; and in real life he's the partner to bubbly, adorable, global Giga-star, Kirsten Dunst. So here's the thing. Not much having been a big afficionado -for the most part at least- of the whole 'Breaking Bad' craze, { arguably Jesse's first 'Really, Really' big-break ( as 'Todd Alquist', 11 Episodes., 2012-2013 ) }, I'd somehow managed to let his "" WHOPPING 🔥❗"" Sixty-three Acting Role Career, to date, somehow slip under the radar ; with the -Sole- exception being his -Relatively- ""diminutive"" ( yet 'tremendously' enjoyable ) part as the -genuinely- likeable ""Jimmy 'Ordy' Ord"" in 2012's massive blockbuster, 'Battleship'. And Now, to see him { seemingly } ""come out of nowhere"", take on this 'Way' larger-than-life kind of part ; & play it with Utter, Consummate -{ "" CLASS "" }- . . . . oh, & don't even get me -started- about his -fabulously- performed German Accent. Suffice to say that his portrayal of the aforementioned -and entirely fictitious- ""Evil megalomaniacal occultist"" Prince, was executed well . . . -{ "" IMMACULATELY "" }- .Summation : Indeed, had it not been for -all- the pretty gross out -{ "" OVERKILL "" }- Mud, Slime, and the -hundreds- , literally , of Bugs & Bees -In- Said Slime, ( the aforementioned trailer -Will- , b.t.w , be able to give you a small, but 'succinct', flavour of this ) . . . I might just have given this film my { ""trademark"" } 12 , or -""Even 13!"" - , marks out of 10, reserved ""Exclusively"" for films that I 'Very, Very wholeheartedly' enjoy. However, as that stuff -{ DID }- actually bother me a fair bit, ( "" Sorry, but that's just -ME- "" ) . . . It's going to remain a 'Solid 10 Marks Out Of 10' . So, umm, still "" not too shabby , eh "" . . . . . "" Wouldn't 'Ya Reckon 😅 💥❓"" .","89 out of 146 found this helpful.

Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt (along with the person playing the latter's brother) take us on a mostly enjoyable ride to whatever they're looking for. My movie theatre-working friend enjoyed this much more than I did but I liked it fine for what it was. Some of the most enjoyable parts were Johnson's corny puns. So that's a partial recommendation of Jungle Cruise.","31 out of 51 found this helpful.

Instead of 2 hrs 15 this could have been 1 hr 15, which is a real shame, because I was intrigued with the whole premise.

The story feels like an adventure with the characters trying to find a tree that cures all illness. It's interesting to learn about the tree they are looking for and what is does when they find it. The movie contains a lot of actions and suspense to be found in it that makes the movie pretty fun to watch and the choreography is done pretty well. I found the acting to be pretty good by each of the actors who gives off a solid performance in the movie. The CGI looks decent on how they made the animals and the other stuff you see in the movie.One flaw is that the movie is easily predictable to guess what happen next in the movie. I also found the characters to be pretty bland in the movie, with exception of the Frank character who have a twist to it. The comedy itself is pretty weak with it being the same throughout the movie and the running jokes gets old really quickly. I also think that the siblings are similar to the ones from The Mummy 1999 which aren't the same, but acts somewhat similar. And I already guess how the movie ends.Overall, it's a decent movie that isn't Disney greatest work, but is still fun.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

Simple. The writers of this movie thought we'd all forgotten about ""The Mummy (1999)""Funny thing, the Mummy 3 (which was a flop) ended with a ""sequel joke"" saying they found mummies in mexico. Guess the writers of this film didn't take the joke as it was meant to be.Because apparently everyone forgot the very popular blockbuster this movie is absolutely ripping off. It's literally the same story, instead of rivers of sand, an actual river.Starting off with Blunt, the heroine with an adventurous passion and a very obnoxious brother who is incapable of doing anything except whine who is even dressed exactly like the one they ripped off. Hat and all.Then there's the villian, who is a superpowered person trapped in time, who someone from its caste is trying to revive with magical powers the people of the world don't believe in.Then, the big gun comes along. He has some problems with the unfair local Jefe, and he needs money, and is using the heroine to save him. They need a guide! And they find a good looking funny Hero of the story who becomes the main protagonist.I'm not gonna give out any spoilers, However if you watched the Mummy, just superimpose the faces of the new actors over the old ones. That's pretty much a spoiler though right?So just do yourselves a favour, go in your old DVD rack , or your parents, there is bound to be a copy of The mummy. Put it in a DVD player, and put a couple of plants on the TV.I literally made this account just for this.","97 out of 173 found this helpful.

I saw it on Disney+ and am sure it would have MOSTLY looked better on the big screen. I say 'mostly' because some of the visuals are amazing and would have looked great...but there also were a few CGI sequences that would have looked worse on the big screen because they look dated...such as the jaguar and the snakes...all of which look fake.As for the story, it started off mostly well but through the course of the film I found myself losing interest for three main reasons. First, many of the characters were silly and one-dimensional, such as the plucky and completely anachronistic lady and here incredibly ridiculous brother. They were poorly written and took me out of the story. Second, and more importantly, the story itself eventually became essentially a reworking of ""Pirates of the Caribbean""....and it was really obvious when they had characters who were nearly the same as Barbarossa and his skeleton crew. Third, over time the film became, dare I say it, boring. This is especially true with the ending...which seemed to go on and on.Overall, Dwayne 'the Rock' Johnson was very good in the film and some of the scenery was amazing...but otherwise this story is so dopey and familiar that you really cannot enjoy it unless you turn off your brain and just accept it without questions...and you're bound to have many as you watch the picture.","62 out of 112 found this helpful.

Rock = good, Jack Whitehall = Brilliant... and then Emily Blunt... I found her character rather annoying to be honest. Its taken bits from the all others that have gone before it, there's some of the pirate of the Caribbean films in there, some Raiders of the lost ark - it mashed them all together. What you get isn't a classic, but its a decent enough effort.

Then look no further than the Disney Live Action film JUNGLE BOOK.Yes...Disney has made another movie based on one of it's them park rides and this one is more like the first PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN film than most of the other attempts.Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (several Liam Neeson action flicks like NON-STOP), JUNGLE CRUISE is part PIRATES, part INDIANA JONES and part AFRICAN QUEEN (look it up, kids) as we follow an adventurous young lady in the 1910's. She heads to the Amazon and hires a ne'er do well Jungle Cruise skipper to take her up river.Pretty standard set-up, right? We've seen this ""mis-matched"" frenemies premise before but in the hands of Emily Blunt and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, it is a very entertaining (albeit familiar) ride with 2 tremendously charismatic performers working off each other very well and they look like they are having as good a time in this film as we are.They are joined by a bevy of assorted characters that help fill out this journey. Edgar Ramirez and Veronica Falcon are enjoyable enough as a couple of characters along the way, while Jack Whitehall surprised the heck out of me as the wimpy brother to Blunt's character who becomes more and more three dimensional as the film progressed - something I didn't think this film would even think about doing.A pair of wiley veterans - Jesse Plemons and good ol' Paul Giamatti - are also on board and each add some (but not a lot) to this film. Plemons is the main villain and he just wasn't villainous enough for my tastes while I wanted much, much more of Giamatti's character than was in this film (and it is a rare film, indeed, that you are left wanting more with a Giamatti character).But make no mistake, this is a Rock and Blunt flick and these two professionals hold the center of this film together very, very well.Director Collet-Serra keeps the action (and comedy) moving along at about the right pace, never dwelling too long on any of the plot points (for if you were to think too much about any of it, it would fall apart) and (for the most part) keeps the action sequences fun and coherent and avoiding over-directing, over-CGI-ing and over-loading these sequences.Speaking of CGI, the main issue with this film is the special effects work - it is not the best (probably a budget issue) and, at times, you really need to suspend disbelief in watching the CGI and convincing yourself that it is a Live Action film you are watching and not a cartoon.But, since the intended audience for this film are families, the less-than-perfect CGI (at times) is forgivable as JUNGLE CRUISE provides plenty of PG-Rated action and fun that the entire family will enjoy.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","126 out of 229 found this helpful.

He plays the token gay character - a little trite, but he is funny in his own right and plays well with the rest of the cast. The only thing that I can really complain about is the villain who isn't really that villainous at all.

"6","/10","Provides predictable thrills that should keep young viewers on the edge of their seats but all others need not apply","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7197102/?ref_=tt_urv","MrDHWong","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tt_urv","5 August 2021","""Jungle Cruise"" is an adventure film based on the Disneyland ride of the same name. Starring Dwayne The Rock Johnson, Emily Blunt, and Jack Whitehall, it provides predictable thrills that should keep young viewers on the edge of their seats but all others need not apply.In 1916 in London, Dr. Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) and her brother MacGregor (Jack Whitehall) attempt to persuade the Royal Society to allow them access to a rare artefact that could help in locating the fabled Tears of the Moon tree, which contain a flower with the ability to cure all known illnesses. When their request is denied, the two of them instead steal the artefact for themselves and quickly set off for South America. Shortly after arriving in Brazil, the siblings meet the eccentric river cruise guide Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson), whom is hired by the pair to aid them in their search for the tree. Unbeknownst to the trio, the unhinged German aristocrat Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons) is hot on their trail with the intent to use the tree to gain immortality for himself.Since the late 90s, Disney has occasionally been adapting their selected theme park rides into movies, each with varying degrees of success. Some have gone on to be among the highest grossing films of all time, with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise raking in over $4.5 billion at the box office, while others bombed so badly I forgot they even existed, like 2002's ""The Country Bears"". ""Jungle Cruise"" is the most recent ride to get the big screen treatment, and with little other source material to extract from, it just narrowly manages to justify its existence.As someone who has actually been on two variations of the titular ride (California and Hong Kong), I can say it was quite fun travelling on a boat through these imaginatively set up jungle areas. To enhance the experience, they have raging torrents of water, exotic animals appearing from thick trees, and the sound of the natives drumming in the background along the way. They truly make you feel as though you have been transported into a colonial era jungle, so naturally translating something like this into a film will never be able to live up to the real thing.This adaptation instead goes for a typical adventure fare in the vein of Indiana Jones, so much so that anyone who has seen films like that will likely be bored from the constant clichés thrown at us. The entire plot is something that has been done to death so many times before - adventurers seek out world-changing MacGuffin to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands - been there, done that. Of course, being a Disney film, the target audience here is young children so it is doubtful that they have seen anything remotely like this before. With that said, I think said children will probably find this film to be a fun distraction to keep them occupied for the two hour runtime.As far as visuals go, the film is a huge mishmash of CGI and obvious green screen effects. None of the jungle animals looked real at all, obviously being products of something created on a sterile computer. Because of this, I didn't feel any tension during the action scenes. For example, a part where Lily and Frank are swinging on a vine made me laugh out loud at how fake it appeared, clearly being a product of poorly implemented green screen editing in post production. Now whether this was done intentionally to pay homage to the cheesiness of the old adventure serials from many decades ago or if it's just laziness on behalf of the filmmakers is up for debate, though I'm going with the latter. Again, I had to remind myself that the main group of people watching this is children who aren't going to care too much about things like that so I suppose it doesn't really matter in the long run.There's something interesting about how Dwayne Johnson has this ability to instantly become such a likeable presence on screen regardless of whom he shares it with. His character Frank, despite making the odd cringe-inducing pun every now and then, was one of the best parts of the film. I liked his confidence in how he was able to find his way out of a sticky situation whenever the plot required it. He's the type of hero that kids look up to, which means he is the most practical selling point for a film like this. Additionally, both Emily Blunt and Jack Whitehall played off Johnson quite well as the British sibling duo Lily and MacGregor. The stark contrast between Lily's adventurous spirit and MacGregor's timid mannerisms made for some fun banter between the both of them. If all three of these characters didn't work as well as they did, then the film would have been a complete failure.Overall, it would be easy to dismiss this project as yet another example of Disney trying to milk their intellectual properties for all they're worth, but we need to remember who their target audience is. They have, and always will, catered to younger demographics when it comes to promoting their media, and a film like ""Jungle Cruise"" is a perfect example of just that. It kills two birds with one stone by both offering a fun movie for children while also advertising the very ride it is based on for any potential tourists wishing to visit Disneyland one day. Even if people like me can't enjoy it as much as the kids do, I can at least appreciate its ability to entertain and shut them up for a while.I rate it 6/10.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Oh yeah and WW1 is happening too by the way.The crux of the plot can be described as The African Queen meets The Mummy. According to legend, there is a tree of life that lays hidden in the Amazon rainforest. Its reputation led many a treaure hunter to their death since the age of conquistadors. Flash forward to World War One. A plucky scholar (Blunt) and her foppish brother (Whitehall) enlist a roguish boat captain (Johnson) to escort them through the jungle. But they must contend with a dastardly German prince (Plemons) who wants to use the tree of life to please his father the Kaiser.The movie does borrow heavily from the Indiana Jones school of adventure filmmaking. There's discount Nazis; hostile natives, a supernatural angle in the mystery, and some heavy CGI spectacle. And also one could throw in influences from Disney's other theme park-blockbuster PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN. Because there is a lot of CGI in this movie. Some of the wide shots look good but there are times where I wish it was done more practical. At least it doesn't look as ugly as that Tarzan movie with SLJ. (anyone else remember that?)What it lacks in originality, the director compensates with execution. There is a LOT of action in this movie. It's almost kind of manic in its energy. The movie's fast paced editing much in the style of old timey serials. And the music by James Newton Howard is actually very good. Much better than it needs to be. Seriously, it has that sweeping energy that you'd expect from a James Horner or Jerry Goldsmith musical score.Both Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt are good in their parts. It's kind of hard not to screw up the Rock playing a jungle hero at this point and Emily Blunt could had been a killer Lara Croft if they did a proper Tomb Raider movie. Jesse Plemons is goofy as the villain but admittedly I never found him threatening. Paul Giamatti shows up briefly and he's quite amusing in his appearance. I wish he was around more. Really I think the surprise MVP is Jack Whitehall as Emily Blunt's brother. He has good comic timing and a satisfying character arc.Jungle Cruise does not reinvent the model for the Hollywood adventure, but it's undeniably fun to watch.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

That movie is produced very well, but it doesn't is a memorable thing.As Brazilian, some things annoy me in the movie, all Brazilians speaks English fluently, includes indigenous, only 1% of the Brazilian population speak English fluently
(I don't consider myself fluent), but The Rock that live 400 years in Brazil speaks perfectly English and doesn't can speak a phrase in Portuguese. Another thing that annoy me is Brazilians characters speaking in Spanish, this is an offense to Brazilian people.

"6","/10","A mildly entertaining film that does not offer anything memorable.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8547795/?ref_=tt_urv","Perspicuity1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur40349414/?ref_=tt_urv","16 September 2022","Every time a Dwayne Johnson movie gets out, my mind starts wondering whether it's an adventure movie or not. Dwayne Johnson's name is synonymous with adventure and fantasy movies because of the number of such films he has done, and I don't see anything wrong in it. Dwayne is aware of what he is best at, and also what viewers want to see the most. Most people don't watch a movie to get a masterclass in acting, all they seek is entertainment and that is exactly what his films have to offer. Regardless of how much criticism he gets, I would never want Dwayne to stop making these kind of movies. Unfortunately, with Jungle Cruise, Dwayne has missed the target. This one is not exactly a fun ride.At a runtime of just over two hours, Jungle Cruise feels at least 30 minutes too long. Shortly after Frank and Lily get on the boat, the energy level of the movie gets turned down to minimum and Jungle Cruise transforms into a rather slow and boring ride. In an adventure movie, it's completely normal to have some kind of dramatic scenes sprinkled over the screenplay, but largely you would want it to be funny, exciting, mysterious, thrilling and perhaps have some scary monsters or have our lead characters face a dangerous situation; unfortunately Jungle Cruise falls short in achieving any of that. The comic element of the film is Dwayne Johnson telling some cheesy jokes that stopped being funny a long time back. What I expected from the film was to experience the fear of the unknown, and see the characters find themselves in a life threatening situation, or find some interesting clues that would lead them to their ultimate destination, discover something new and unique, find some mysterious people on their journey who would become a part of their mission; but unfortunately none of that happens. The screenplay of the movie is flawed because our captain Frank is already aware of everything on the route because he has been doing this for years, and this journey was always meant to be safe, in other words plain and boring.The core concept of the movie is not really original as it borrows heavily from the Johnny Depp film Pirates of the Caribbean. Soldiers cursed to stay near the water for stealing something precious, is something we have already seen in the Pirates of the Caribbean movie. The writers it seems conceptualized everything about the antagonists seeking inspiration from The Curse of the Black Pearl, the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, because you would notice that even the visuals of the crew members are pretty much the same. But even after plagiarizing so much, Jungle Cruise is not even half as interesting or engaging as the Johnny Depp film.What saves this film from being a total washout is the incandescent Emily Blunt. The screenplay never really rises from the abyss of mediocrity, but the performance of Emily Blunt shines throughout the film. Emily Blunt is not only one of the most beautiful women of the world but also a terrific actress, and she confidently and charmingly carries the entire film on her shoulders, because unfortunately the writers forgot to add any life to it.Dwayne Johnson has a great physical presence, but he can't act, and his lack of acting skills gets exposed in a pretty bad way in movies like Jungle Cruise, which don't have a lot of adventure. Perhaps it would have been better if he had cast some other actor in the lead role opposite Emily Blunt, someone closer to her age and perhaps knew how to act as well. Dwayne Johnson's inability to act like anything else but the 'Rock' removes all scope of a romance between the lead pair, which is a shame because when you have an actress as gorgeous as Emily Blunt in your film, you would want to see some kind of love to blossom between the lead characters, and that is why I feel this film should have had a different actor opposite Emily.Jungle Cruise is a mildly entertaining film that you would not want to revisit because it does not offer anything memorable.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

I get it, Collet-Serra nodding to his homeland is understandable, but it does not add to the film.On the acting side, The Rock and Emily Blunt are correct in their respective roles and share good chemistry and it's that chemistry what mostly drives the film.So, if you are an 80's kid and can let yourself get engulfed in nostalgia, you might enjoy this.If, instead, you're looking for something innovative or groundbreaking, then this is not your movie.Note: Like some other fellow imdber stated before, it irked me so much that nobody seemed to care to learn how to pronounce ""lágrimas""!

She brings her brother McGregor, the kind of weak man (at least on the surface) more common in films these days as a comedic foil. They travel to the Amazon and enlist the help of Frank Wolff, a dodgy and lying boat cruise tour guide who offers to help Lily, originally for money, but once he notices her arrowhead necklace he has a greater interest. Frank is a Kind of a Captain Sparrow type character, quicker with a great pun. And ofcourse, when it comes to treasure in the jungle she's pursued by an evil German (not a Nazi though, this is WW1 remember) and more to find the petal, which has never been found.The film was a fun ride, I've never gone on the jungle cruise ride (the Disney attraction the movie is based on) but you can see how it would work. The setting is fun and the movie has a pretty good blend of action, comedy and camaraderie. Dwayne Johnson is great fun as always.The standout poor however was the CGI. I know that this time we live in Animals are used less and less, but the leopard looked unrealistic and for some reason, we get a lot of closeups which just shows how unreal it looks. It's Disney, it's not like they didn't have the money. Or alternatively, even a puppet could have looked better. The other thing is the characters, the Changes in the character of Frank through the film, seem to seesaw back and front, with the film setting him up a certain way then yoyoing it a couple of times. But it doesn't take away from the fact it's a fun ride.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Are they hoping Jungle Cruise will do the same? There are lots of similarities but maybe not ... it's good but not quite at the level of PoC. However, it never lags. Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt play nicely off each other, there's lots of engaging action and variety (as long as you don't think too closely about some of it), and it finishes up in the true Disney mold.At the beginning of the third act though, there's a big twist in the plot that utterly changes an important character's identity (no spoilers) and that really doesn't feel right given everything that's happened up to that point. And after that point, the obligatory wind-up action scenes just go on too long into the realm of sensory overload. ""if the only thing happening is relentless physical action, it's a sure sign that no story is being told."" (from Ursula LeGuin.)Still, enough of it is fun and yes it's suitable for the whole family. Enjoy the ride.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

It tells a safe and simplistic story that's also fairly predictable. In honesty, I wasn't expecting the story to be anything special considering its's a Disney film. What really carries this movie are its characters. Dwayne Johnson knows how to play a charismatic character, and in this film, he does a great job. It's hard not to like Frank in this film, he actually outshines all the other characters. Lily and Macgregor are just really unremarkable. I don't know if they're supposed to be stereotypes or parodies, but they seem quite one-dimensional with their character traits and development.One of the biggest flaws with this movie are its visuals. There's way too much CGI, and it's very noticeable. The CGI itself wasn't particularly bad, it's just that there was too much of it. And the pacing was a little off. There were times where the story should be ramping up, but it just slowed down.Jungle Cruise takes a lot of inspiration from other movies but it doesn't reach the same level as those movies. Jungle Cruise isn't a bad movie, it just plays everything in the most safe and predictable way possible. You can certainly find entertainment out of Jungle Cruise, but don't expect anything too special out of this movie.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is 1916. The adventure begins when Dr. Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) goes on a hunt for a unique item that is naturally in a forbidden part of the jungle. She has to team up with the gregarious riverboat captain, Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson) who has a few secrets of his own. Naturally, they are pursued by the bad guys that are after the same item.

Jumanji sequel?A new adventure in the jungle from Disney. Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt embarked on a journey searching for the legendary tree of life.As an adventure, it was solid and entertaining. The cinematography of the jungle was amazing with beautiful wide shots of the rivers, hills, and trees. Also, the main characters had a lot of action and came through many places in the jungle. The designs of the the cursed characters, especially the one with the snakes, looked amazing. If you watch this movie in the theater, it would be quite a great experience (it's still great watching on Disney Plus). Of course, this was all expected from this type of movie and also from Disney.The story, tho, wasn't as solid as the adventure. The biggest problem was that there wasn't a sense of urgency or strong justification for why the characters wanted to go on the trip. The backstory felt rushed and didn't have a big impact on me or how I felt about the characters. Because of this, at the end, I didn't feel as satisfied as I could have. There was also a theme of sexism in old society, and it felt forced.The cast did great playing their characters. I liked Dwayne Johnson the most, not that he was phenomenal, although he did bring the charisma to the character. However, the story didn't do a good job of getting me invested in the characters. The villains were of course bland and not memorable.Overall, a fun enough adventure that I would still recommend, despite its problems in story and characters. 6.5/10.","11 out of 20 found this helpful.

And then it dawned on me. This has so many similarities with The Mummy.Our main character is an educated woman who wants to find mythical treasure. Has an annoying brother that complains about leaving civilization. With the help of an adventurer to defeat cursed people from ancient time. And there are more.I think this movie was aimed to younger audience. Well you know what this movie based on. That's why they write the story to be not too complicated. The CGI is not that great but just good enough. Some goofy scene, and simple jokes.Emily Blunt did the best acting here, and even that's not a really great performance, just adequate and not over doing it. Dwayne Johnson's acting is as usual as his other movie. The other performers did nothing stellar either.In conclusion, simple plot, adequate acting, barely passable CGI, etc, this is an average movie. Enjoyable but won't give you long lasting impression.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The formula is quite derivative and familiar. There's a MacGuffin, some bad guys, a quest to find a long lost object/place that is the stuff of legend. You won't find anything revolutionary here, but its all very fun and enjoyable.What really sets this apart from similar films in the genre, and what stops it from being a 5/10 is the performances. Despite being unsure at the beginning I grew to love Jack Whitehall's performance and character. The Rock is always very watchable and gives one of his better performances in this. Jesse Plemons is always brilliant. But the standout is Emily Blunt. She's always so watchable, so engaging, so entertaining, and she was a joy to watch in this film. The characters were well written and the performances were all good.Finally the film looked pretty impressive. The CGI wasn't always amazing, but it was never bad, and the shots of the Jungle and the river etc, all were pretty good. It just had a very vibrant and energetic style and tone which I enjoyed.I think this film really punched above its weight, and managed to keep me thoroughly entertained for two hours. A really pleasant surprise.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Delayed due to COVID-19 and released directly to OTT, Jungle Cruise has a good adventure, but the story seemed to lack attraction with loose ends.Johnson's Frank is fun, though. The screenwriters have given him a boatload of cheesy puns as a nod to the theme park ride, and Johnson sells it like he always does. He continues to be very watchable and light, and he and Blunt are clearly having a blast together. Their energy is infectious. Blunt, meanwhile, is wholly wonderful and operating on another level. She is completely and effortlessly at home as Lily is delightful to watch.It is a fine adventure with two genuine movie stars that may very well become a rewatchable staple like the films it references. But on first watch, it mostly comes across as an earnest and safe homage.My Rating : 6/10.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Tomorrowland had its moments and there was a bit of charm to The Haunted Mansion, even though the film wasn't good, but due to the lack of quality in this area, I couldn't get myself all that excited for Jungle Cruise. I'm a fan of both Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, so that alone was going to get at least one eventual viewing out of me, but I actually checked it out on opening weekend, and I must admit that I had a good time with it. It's a mixture of many adventure films that have all been done better, but those elements made it a fun ride. It's very far from great, but here's why I'd still recommend Jungle Cruise.Jungle Cruise gets going right off the bat. A riverboat skipper by the name of Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson) is enlisted by hunter Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) to take her and her brother to an enchanted cave to discover if the myths are true. Without going into details of what they're searching for, this film builds to a very colourful finale, but this aspect is actually the film's biggest downfall. The first act of the film feels like a mixture of Indiana Jones and The Mummy (which is what everyone else has been comparing it to as well), but with the feel of Pirates of the Caribbean. That may seem like a complaint, but it borrows aspects of all these films without feeling like a rip-off. As I said though, it's really the third act that is an overall detriment.As the film gets going, I was chuckling quite a few times at the cheesy one-liners Johnson would deliver and his chemistry with Blunt was also terrific. Her character was very likeable and her motive was reasonable enough to serve the story. The biggest issue I had with the film is that where it all leads to didn't feel unique enough. It felt like visuals and settings that have been seen many times before. Once the adventure aspect of the film concludes, I was more or less just wanting to see their journey back or for the film to just end. I would almost call the first two acts of the film very good, but the conclusion really bogged it down for me.Overall, nothing about this film felt original, which is what kept me from being able to call it great. It's undeniably fun to watch, due to the stars having a blast, but it's just visually like many other films. It has some great moments and Jesse Plemons as Prince Joachim stole the show for me. His presence just ate up the scenery and I loved it. Jungle Cruise is far from being a bad film but I would direct everyone to many other adventure flicks before this one. Still, as I said, if you can look past the fact that it's a bunch of the classics all meshed together, it's quite a fun experience in the end. Now in theatres and streaming on Disney+, I can mildly recommend this one.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Jungle Cruise harkens strives to evoke memories of adventure classics, and while entertaining does feel like a highlight of ""best of"" moments from the genre.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7545105/?ref_=tt_urv","IonicBreezeMachine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117926588/?ref_=tt_urv","14 November 2021","In 1916, Dr. Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) is a tenacious botanist who along with her foppish brother MacGregor (Jack Whitehall) are outsiders in the scientific community. After unsuccessful petitioning the Royal Society for access to artifacts to search for the fabled Amazonian tree the Tears of the Moon rumored to have extraordinary healing properties, Lily is forced to ""borrow"" the artifact, an arrowhead, which has already been promised to Kaiser Wilhelm's son Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons). Traveling to Brazil, Lily and MacGregor reluctantly enlist the help of cynical fast talking riverboat captain Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson) to guide them down the river while contending with the jungle and river's many hazards as well as evading Joachim's competing expedition.Jungle Cruise is the latest attempt by Walt Disney Studios to adapt one of their popular theme park attractions to feature films, well in line with the company's previous attempts such as TV movie Tower of Terror, theatrical releases The Country Bears and The Haunted Mansion, but most especially the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise which blew away the most conservative expectations with its 2003 releases spawning a massive multimedia franchise encompassing 5 films with a reboot currently in production. Jungle Cruise began development in 2004, shortly after the success of Pirates of the Caribbean with the intention being a reteam of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen from Disney's Toy Story franchise but this version was scrapped and the project would stall in development until 2015 when it was revived as a vehicle for Dwayne Johnson with Johnson coming aboard as a producer who wanted the film to call to mind the likes of Indiana Jones, Romancing the Stone, and the Humphrey Bogart/Katherine Hepburn film The African Queen. Like many films intended for the 2020 Summer movie season, Jungle Cruise was pulled from release and bounced around the calendar until Diseny opted for a day and date combo release for the film theatrically as well as a premium purchase via their Disney+ service. The end result of Jungle Cruise is mostly entertaining, but it also feels like a pretty familiar patchwork of films of this type you've seen before.As usual, Johnson does a good job of playing hardscrabble cynic (even if maybe it's become ""too"" familiar on him) and Johnson is having a lot of fun in the role especially in his introductory scenes of giving a river tour (complete with bad puns) to a gaggle of panicky tourists who are prone to voicing complaints both the tour and his jokes. Emily Blunt makes for a fun protagonist feeling reminiscent of Rachel Weisz' Evelyn Carnahan from the Stephen Summers helmed The Mummy movies albeit without that character's clumsiness. The movie also looks very nice with the Brazilian port town being a bustling hive of activity and the colors of the jungle are nicely vibrant with lots of detail in the designs be they tribal villages or ancient ruins. The action sequences are a lot of fun with some good scope and scale given to the proceedings, and there is a sense of intrigue given to the adventure that makes you want to follow it through to the end.The movie despite trying to evoke adventure classics is a bit lacking in the polish that those films had. Emily Blunt's parallels to Rachel Weisz' character from The Mummy become even more glaring down to the fact that Blunt has her own equivalent of John Hannah's character from that film in her foppish brother MacGregor played by Jack Whitehall who feels rather unnecessary even by the standards of comedy relief characters. The writers do try to give the character a bit more weight by hinting at a backstory where MacGregor was shunned by his family and society due to being homosexual hence why he accompanies his sister Lily who's the only one who didn't abandon him and the scene where he tells this story to Frank is well done, but the character is such a helpless dead weight that it feels like you could've cut his character out of the script with little effort. The movie is also rather lacking in its villains with Jesse Plemons' Prince Joachim really not conveying any sense of menace, and often coming off like a mixture of Captain Kangaroo by way of Colonel Klink. The movie also has the element of undead Conquistadors who have a good introduction but like Prince Joachim they over play the silliness and the characters down to the curse and the nature thereof make it pretty obvious these characters are repackages of familiar villain types we've seen across the five Pirates of the Caribbean films (with Davy Jones I particular feeling like a major influence).Jungle Cruise is fun, but it's also undeniably familiar calling to mind the previous 20 years' worth of adventure films. While Johnson and Blunt are enjoyable as the leads, Jack Whitehall is a bit grating as the comic relief, and the movie doesn't have much in the way of memorable villains. The movie is entertaining with some engaging action and some funny lines from Johnson especially in regards to his ""tour boat"" persona, and if you're a fan of old style adventure films you'll find plenty to like, but you'll also feel a bit of déjà vu.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Hard to believe, this is the same studio that had at one time brought us some fine pieces of work in the same Genre (Fantasy/Adventure). If I were to take names, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Chronicles of Narnia; these two come first to mind.However, for the past few years; fate has not been so kind to them. Lawsuits, Protests, Strikes; they have been in the news for all the wrong reasons (They still are), And now that everyone's once-beloved Studio is slowly losing its charm, It's high time; they take these matters all the more seriously and try to recuperate their legacy before it's too late.Now, coming back to my review...""Jungle Cruise"", as luxurious as it may sound from the title; I'm sorry to inform, it's not quite up to par with general expectancies. With discernible commonalities to Disney's past endeavors; this is yet again the same platter presented in a different way. Now that is completely fine as long as they do it in a proper fashion! Which, with all due respect; hasn't really been the case over here!At the same time, having two very likable personalities at the forefront has surely helped. Cause let the truth be told, Dwyane Johnson and Emily Blunt; both pretty much carried this entire execution on their able shoulders.Without them, things could have been much worse; I reckon!Apart from being Visually Poignant; needless to say, this meticulous style of presentation has the Trademark of Disney written all over it! Not to mention, the Score; which as you'd expect, neatly complemented the on-screen depiction. Hence from a technical viewpoint, I am pleased to say; everything went rather smoothly.When it comes down to Humor, for the most part; it's been hit or miss. But I'll admit, I had fun with a few one-liners occasionally! Albeit, the same cannot be said about its Screenplay! Attributable to its stagnant nature; the pace drastically drops and as a result, the movie hangs heavy at certain moments. Even the final act has been a victim of a similar treatment!Reading through all of this, if you still can't get ahold of my final verdict; then let me just simplify it for you.This is an honorable OTW (One-time-watch) at best. Not entirely child-friendly (Please keep that in mind); but an entertaining and charming ride nonetheless. If you happen to have a mood for some Adventure stuff; rest assured, you would be having a good enough time with this.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

This movie is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan) and stars Dwayne Johnson (Rundown), Emily Blunt (Edge of Tomorrow), Paul Giamatti (American Splendor) and Jesse Plemons (The Irishman). The storyline for this picture was pretty much copy/paste of The Mummy just not as good - a brother and sister hire a local to track down the mummy in a unique CGI filled environment. The CGI animals and environment were awesome in this and the action was fun. The acting was solid and the chemistry between Johnson and Blunt was perfect.

The sub would def ground in that river.","31 out of 59 found this helpful.

The plot picks up and is actually quite scary and creepy definitely not kid friendly. It is very similar to pirates of the Caribbean with these mutated magical decayed people that come after them. Then they have Germans in a sub marine also after them and it's a race against all party's to take a magical item from the Forrest.There is forced romance throughout the movie and it definitely isn't the films strongest asset. The end is quite typical and cheesy but still good with anticipation as they fight for their lives. It was a pleasantly unexpected story that was very fun to watch. It wasn't the best at the start, had a okay romance but overall the story and characters were great.

The movie takes little time to get things going, an adventure movie that lays down the stakes, tells you the purpose and then gets going with quick character introduction. Jungle Cruise's pacing only continues to move at a steady pace, continuing to give you the feeling of being on a supped up version of the ride as it blazes a trail down the Amazon in search of the mystical fruit that can cure all. And yet, it still provides ample opportunity to give you the character dynamics, background, and interactions that you hope to get with main characters.Fun Movie:
With the goal of being geared towards families, Jungle Cruise accomplishes the mission of being fun for the whole family to enjoy. A great blend of comedy, warm hearted interactions, cute CGI animals, and some decently balanced action are all wonderful mixtures to set you on a fun adventure. I found myself diving back into the golden era of Disney live action movies, that found a way to bring some heart without crossing over too many boundaries of dark, kiddy, or sappy, that many of the modern era movies tend to tread. That fun was due to a lot of things for me, which I've talked about below.Darker Elements Make For Stakes:
Part of what helped make it endearing were the darker elements of the movie. Like the first Pirates, life in this movie is not magical rainbows and ignorance to the struggles of the world, oh no not even close. There is a darker history in the realm of the Amazon that holds danger and excitement, and this story used it well. Like Pirates of the Caribbean, the actions of man speak volumes in this story and paint some engaging characters that are very reminiscent of the Barbosa and his pirate crew. Their motivations, alongside the abilities granted to them, are part of that Disney magic I love to see, familiar to be nostalgic and fun, but different enough to warrant originality points.Design/Setting:
Disney knows how to utilize their resources well to craft these worlds we fall in love, and Jungle Cruise continues to show off their muscles. The Jungle itself is beautifully crafted, feeling much like the dark, dangerous worlds of the rain forest that we've read about so often. It's vibrant colors hide many dangers, and I loved seeing Disney dance with what flora and fauna they could bring to challenge our group. Deadly bugs, booby traps, even the water itself was crafted amazingly to be the deadly playground for these daring explorers to test their merits in. Costumes get a shout as well, a variety of clothing from the past that showed off the trends of our ancestors, and also managing to give some flair to the normal tribal outfits that stood out to me. Yet it was the CGI conquistadors who get a bit more of a thumbs up in their animation and unique structure. I can't say much without ruining it, but the cursed heroes are certainly amalgams of their curse and I loved getting to see how their abilities varied and reflected the very prison they stomped around in.The Comedy:
While not quite as clever or genius as Pirates' writing, Jungle Cruise made a solid effort in bringing the laughs for this reviewer and his fellow audience. The Rock is a natural at dad jokes and puns, but also using that same sarcasm and stubbornness to his advantage to sell many of his lines. A CGI sidekick offers its own brand of comedy as well, a unique pet that has human like qualities and blunders that bring out some well-timed dialogue. And of course being Disney, plenty of accidental slapstick keeps things whimsical and fun despite the shadows they face beneath the leaves of the Amazon.The Acting:
With such a dynamic cast, I must say I was impressed with how well everyone worked in this rather bold idea. The Rock as the leading man continues to be a fun actor, while not really playing too different of a role, he has mastered his performance quite well to always make his films entertaining despite the one note he plays Jack Whitehall has the quirky brother role down as well, a sort of Jonathan from the Mummy like quality that is again entertaining and yet touching at the right moments to offset the strong personalities he is with. Jesse Plemons did a nice job in the humorous toned down villain role that Disney movies love making. I could picture more from him in the future, but was good for what I think the studio made him do. Ramirez was quite the main villain, and had a lot of fire and looks to his role, but... he just needed more time on screen to really show me everything he had. The champion of the movie is of course Emily Blunt, whose diversity, quirks, and execution were nearly perfect in every aspect. Balanced and strong, but again with vulnerabilities of her character, she is an example of a main character I hope other movies take a page from instead of the mess we have been getting.DISLIKES:The CGI:
Again, better than what I could generate, the Jungle Cruise still has a ways to go to blow me out of the water with the realness of their CGI. Much of the movie has that artificial tone to it, primarily in the animals that roam about the jungle. Sometimes it works well given the human qualities they want to bestow, but the artificial look still needs some practice before they obtain the levels that Avatar and Transformers accomplished long ago.More Time In the Adventure:
Several times the movie decides to take shortcuts on the trip, reducing the potential obstacles of the Amazon to merely tracing a line over the map. I understand it was to help save time and money, but these quick bouts of missing the river sort of felt like an incomplete adventure, one that could have involved much more fun from the Disney studios. Crocodiles/gators? Deadly birds? Heck even some sort of serpent would have felt right at home in this Amazonian lore to really give the adventure the complete picture it needed. Such interruptions disturbed the natural flow of the story, and in some cases shortsheeted the characters they were starting to build up resulting in incomplete use of the cast. Looking back at movies like Pirates of the Caribbean, it's amazing how spoiled I was with the balance they achieved, and though Jungle Cruise has approached this more than other movies it still has room to improve.The action:
Ahhh, the modern age has sort of messed up the action genre given the lack of balance and political preferences that seem to plague everything these days. Jungle Cruise managed to inject some themes into their fights in this installment, granting them the child approved fights (for the most part) as the group decked it out. Normally this works in an animated film like Toy Story or Zootopia, but in a movie like this... it again feels a bit disappointing at how diluted the fights feel. Submarine chases with little bite to them, promising fights with cursed soldiers reduced to a few edits of chops before switching to something else, and poor extras making exaggerated stabs at nothing before getting pushed away are some of the ""fighting"" you have to look forward to in this tale. I'll say it again, but looking at the first pirates movie shows you can have engaging sword fights, battles against the ships, and some decent chases that are adult and kid friendly as they fit into the theme.The Cursed Conquistadors:
These guys took the brunt of being cut from the film and I had wanted more involvement with them given how quintessential they were to the story. With interesting and dynamic designs, a power set to be truly terrifying to work around, and some personal connections, the group dropped the ball on new landmark villains in place of more laughs and toned down violence. Many of the side soldiers seemed to have stories of their own, but their personalities were lost to the two or three other stories this movie had and that was a shame given their potential. This movie really needed to look at not overdoing it with the stories and finding one or two tales to hit and weaving the side stories in a bit better.The VERDICT:Jungle Cruise turns out to be another fun ride to movie translation that has a lot of family friendly elements they were gunning to achieve. The pace overall is welcoming to a variety of attention spans, and infuses lots of laughs, toned down fights, and character development to help the audience enjoy the adventure at hand. A world with lots of beautiful designs, one may feel as immersed as I was in the visuals and sounds the studio made to try and get us in the South American biome. And the acting is another great example of casting that gives performances with remarkable chemistry, well timed delivery, and a mastery at points of playing Disney characters.However, the movie still fails to achieve the fluidity that Pirates of the Caribbean had all those years ago, potentially due to the sensitivity of the current generation. Cuts in the adventure and making the story predictable sort of lightens up on the edge the movie was starting to develop, and the comedic aspects of the CGI characters while cute sometimes gets in the way of the adventure element I was hoping to see. Yet it's the action and bad guys who suffer the most In this film feeling sort of rushed and censored in order to allow more age groups to see the film and capitalize on its success. I'm not saying it has to involve dismemberment and blood, but Pirates proves how darkness can be wielded to engage a story and still be okay for audience members. Still, the movie was much better than I anticipated and therefore I'm giving it.Action/Adventure/Comedy: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.5.","61 out of 112 found this helpful.

I pay respect to Johnson for choosing Emily to work with as I am a huge supporter of hers and just like her former co stars he pays her the respect on screen so she can shine. His frame and muscles normally take over so it was nice to see him try to be in the background and focus on the banter. I love the chemistry they have, the back and forth during some of the interviews promoting this movie went down a path that you wouldn't want for a Disney movie if you know what I mean :) Not the best movie of their careers but one to just have a laugh with. 6.5/10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The project was a labor of love for Walt Disney and has thrilled millions of guests with the scenic cruise, animated animals, and the cringe-worthy puns and jokes from the captains who have made it an enduring legend.Since attractions ranging from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", ""The Haunted Mansion"" and ""The Tower of Terror"" have made their way to screens along with others over the years; it was not much of a shock to hear that The Jungle Cruise was next in line to make the leap to the big screen. Despite several release date changes and then a lengthy delay due to Covid; the film has finally arrived backed by a star-studded premiere at Disneyland.When Doctor Lilly Houghton (Emily Blunt) with the help of her high-maintenance brother MacGregor (Jack Whitehall) desire to find a mythical item and gain entry into a prestigious organization; they are hampered by the sexist views of early 1900 England and forced to steal an artifact and race to the Amazon.With a dangerous foreigner; Prince Joachim Jesse Plemons and his goons in hot pursuit, Lilly and her brother find themselves in the company of a boat captain named Frank (Dwayne Johnson); who in dire need of money uses all sorts of methods to gain a charter and take Lilly and her brother into a dangerous area.Along the way, all manner of humor, action, and dangers arise as everything from hostile natives, animals, rapids, and of course, The Prince stands in their way. If this was not bad enough; there is also a matter of a curse that must be factored in which presents an even bigger danger than before.In a race against time, Frank and Lilly must learn to trust and work with one another and decipher the clues to save the day and keep the forces of evil from winning.The film takes a bit of time to get going as while there is some action and great scenery and sets; early on it does seem to be unsure of what type of film it wants to be and what type of story it wants to tell.Is it a madcap adventure with a dash of romance? Is it an FX-laden action spoof? Perhaps it is an over-the-top action film that recalls the fabled cinematic adventures of old?In reality, the film is a combination of all of the above. I had flashes of ""The African Queen"", ""Romancing the Stone"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Pirates of The Caribbean"", and ""The Mummy"" during the film.While the MacGuffin element of the film may be a bit confusing for some with more questions than answers; Blunt and Johnson work very well with one another and Whitehall provides a wider element to his character making him more than the comic relief in the film.The FX are very enjoyable and the film mixes the humor with the action well including some of the best jokes from the attraction.While it may at first glance be considered just a routine adventure film; the movie blends a strong and enjoyable cast with a fun adventure that recalls the thrilling cinematic tales of old but does so with a fresh and modern twist.4 stars out of 5.","61 out of 115 found this helpful.

The movie is the the same in it's a fun family adventure movie and Emily Blunt really made it. I recommend to everybody who can still let their 'inner child out to play'.The only complaint I have is Rock.. many actors reach their expiration date and he's certainly reached his. Not just because I don't like his acting but primarily because he's been over marketed and has been in so many movies that I now avoid movies with him in it. Had it not been a big Disney pic with a history I'd never have watched it simply because of him. He's like Samuel Jackson... they've both been in so many pics that it's just sickening to see them in an otherwise good movie. Some actors actually can act like Downey for example and they never play a role the same way but in his case and many others who always just play themselves without any acting involved, they get old quick. And when they can't act and also are in 50 movies in a decade... both.. it's just wow... makes me want to, we'll, not watch it. Time to find some new leading men for fun movies Hollywood!!!However Blunt makes up for it in this case...we'll worth the watch.

The tone is relatively light enough for young children and it contains plenty of adventure thrills that just about compel you through its two plus hour run time.Dwayne Johnson fans should enjoy his charming, humorous performance as he puns his way through the action and character exchanges with Emily Blunt and Jack Whitehall. There are some references to Maui thrown in for good measure.Blunt and Whitehall both do well with the material they have, particularly Blunt who has natural charisma, plausible action hero qualities and a strong screen presence.Whitehall is good, but his character's sexuality feels somewhat forced into the plot and one scene of dialogue in particular. What does not help matters is he is written as a bit of a camp stereotype for his scenes of fish-out-of-water comedy.There is a lot of effects-driven spectacle which is great if you place importance of that type of thing, but it does grow tiresome after so many scenes of white knuckled river action, cursed conquistadors, and death defying moments. It does though contain some great art direction and design relating to the Amazon.I watched it with my 6 year old daughter who is a Moana fan and she enjoyed it.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Shaky cam, quick cuts, close ups. I'm used to it in fight scenes in bad action movies. It recently sunk snake eyes for me. But this movie barely has fight scenes. It isn't martial arts. So why is it still being used? So many scenes were difficult to follow, especially the ones involving cgi.That's my main complaint. There were some stupid moments, and i started getting bored by the end. But i had a decent time and laughed a good amount. It's fairly entertaining with a serviceable story. But with the terribly filmed action and being bored during the climax, i can't give this a positive score (1 viewing, 8/4/2021)","21 out of 41 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, this didn't keep my interest like those did.It also attributes 21st century identity politics to the period characters and is spoilt in my view by using stereotypes of ""sexist"" men. In the past most people (including a lot of women) had views on the roles of men and women that would be regarded as sexist today, but why attack men in the film? It doesn't add anything and just seems like an attempt by Disney to score points with women.Apart from that niggle it is not a terrible film but could have been better.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

When Disneyland opened back in the 1950s one of its feature attractions was ""Jungle Cruise."" In fact Walt Disney himself was the first skipper, his idea was to show the people how some of the different parts of the world looked.So here we have a 2-hour movie which works on this premise. It is 1917 and British lady archaeologist (Emily Blunt) sets out to find an ancient artifact in the jungles of Brazil. She brings along a map and her very proper brother (Jack Whitehall) and they hook up with a shady guy (Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) with a cruise boat.There is quite a bit of story at the starting point, and most of the story as they travel up the Amazon river. Being Disney the violence is way underplayed and we never witness any killings, which is good. Very much CGI is incorporated but it all adds up to a very entertaining movie experience. A large part because all the actors are in fine form.Much of the water scenes were actually filmed in Atlanta in a studio with a large pool and blue screen. The village we see is a large set built in Hawaii.My wife and I watched it at home on BluRay from our public library. As such picture and sound are first-rate.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The writers and creators must have been huge Pirates of the Caribbean fans as many similarities between them can be spotted from a league away!Both are based on a Disneyland ride of the same name. Both only give a nod to the ride they're emulating: a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, in this case a well-placed Hippo. Both are set mostly on water. And both use fantastical legends as a backstory to transpose into the present storyline.That's where most of the similarities end. While Pirates has a fun, quirky lead played by the unequalled Depp, Jungle has a non-eyebrow-lifting Dwayne replacable by any action/comedy star of the moment, as he brings nothing uniquely Johnson nor The Rock into proceedings. Even the bland Whitehall, luckily without his uncouth father, playing the supposedly comic sidekick seemed underused and when he was it fell short on its face, like he did on numerous occasions!The ghosts of exploitations past were a highlight due to their great special effects. The tiger, too, was as real as it could get! Hopefully no Joe Exotic animals were used!Emily hangs her screams and terrorised face (from A Quiet Place) and puts on her era-inappropriate pants that make her a force to be reckoned with...for a while at least!It's a mishmash of genres: from an 18th Century masochist society period piece, to the uncivilised jungles of Brazil, with nods to Indiana Jones' treasure hunter and more, it's neither one or the other.Don't get me wrong, kids will love it, even if some scenes show death in new ways. But for those who have seen their fair share of action, comedy, adventure films, this has bits from all of them muddled together like the story of the petal and the curse! Watch it once, at least!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

So you soon forget thinking about how there is room for his giant submarine in a shallow south american river.So if you are just after some classic family friendly fun, like in Around the World in 80 Days og Journey to the Centre of the Earth, this is perfect.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Jungle Cruise might be an attraction at Disney Parks but as a movie in runs dry. The movie obviously borrows its concept from its brother ride Pirates of the Caribbean but sadly it does not measure up with obvious story line, sequence and plot points. The bad guy is as generic as the devices used in the movie which have been seen in other pictures in the past. Emily Blunts and Dwayne Johnsons chemistry as banters go is superb but as a love interest is as believable as this movie is sure to NOT get a sequel. Sadly the people behind this movie do not waste the opportunity to inject the audience plainly rejected act of social commentary, if they had invested the same energy into giving the movie an original formula instead of a rehash of past properties it might had a chance to hold its own. As a bored Saturday time killer it works, maybe to waste time at the mall, and or for the kiddies they MIGHT enjoy it. I suggest you leave to watch when it is available without pay.","28 out of 58 found this helpful.

If this was not bad enough; there is also a matter of a curse that must be factored in which presents an even bigger danger than before.In a race against time, Frank and Lilly must learn to trust and work with one another and decipher the clues to save the day and keep the forces of evil from winning.The film takes a bit of time to get going as while there is some action and great scenery and sets; early on it does seem to be unsure of what type of film it wants to be and what type of story it wants to tell.Is it a madcap adventure with a dash of romance? Is it an FX-laden action spoof? Perhaps it is an over-the-top action film that recalls the fabled cinematic adventures of old?","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's truly baffling to me on why that it is, and I just don't have an answer. Perhaps the industry has just become too reliant on that technology. Instead of just using it in key moments they literally use it for the whole film. Kind of like what George Lucas did with the whole prequel 'Star Wars' trilogy perhaps.Then Disney has a fixation to insert a certain element into everything they put out nowadays, no matter that it has absolutely zero to do with the plot. Just focused on check boxes and it's getting tiresome... we get it Disney.Emily Blunt has been one of my favourite actresses for awhile now, and as usual, she did very well. The Rock is pretty much just the Rock, as always, though I was a fan of his puns. Jesse Plemons must have a great agent, because it seems as though I see him in everything. And good on him because he's a great actor and I expect to keep seeing him.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Though Blunt and Johnson tried hard they were just shy of reaching the onscreen chemistry needed for a believable attraction and live happily ever after ending. Plemons as the antagonist of the movie was more a parody than to be taken seriously as a catalyst for the movie's plot line. I did think Paul Giamatti's performance was one of the best of the movie even though a small role.Understanding this is a Disney movie for family audiences helps set the right level of expectation. It is a decent movie for a family ""outing"" though the Christian conservative right may be offended and question the need for inclusion of one scene in particular.

Many elements have been ""borrowed"" from better films like Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean and Jumanji.

The cast Emily Blunt (Lily Houghton) puts in a stellar performance, the clown of the movie Jack Whitehall (MacGregor Houghton) puts in solid show and is fun throughout. Other stand-outs are Paul Giamatti (Nilo) and Jesse Plemons (Prince Joachim). Dwayne Johnson (Frank Wolff) is entertaining and funny, as an actor he knows his limitations and he was a bit hit or miss when it came to emotional acting, making any chemistry between Frank and Lily flat.In brief, Lily is an English explorer is in search for the Tears of the Moon flower, the petals of which can cure anything. Not taken seriously or accepted by her piers because she is a woman as they withhold the arrowhead from her which holds the secret to the sought after petals. She must use her own initiative and take the task into her own hands, followed all the way by her buffoon of a brother, MacGregor. The task includes travelling the formidable Amazon in Brazil to find the location of the flower. Frank, who runs a jungle cruise with his hard bartering and cheap jokes he becomes the only captain who can navigate the impossible task (which turns out to be not really that difficult). The jungle cruise adventure that follows does have its dangers, mainly in the form of Prince Joachim who also searches for he petals to win the war and some long lost Conquistadors are they myth or legend? Who will get to the tree first?Not reading too much into it it's a fun feel good action adventure for all the family, it's no Indiana Jones but rather more on par with Allan Quatermain, if you like a good old fashioned adventure quest or Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson then give it a watch you won't be let down and the kids will love it (Cartoon violence with a few frights but suitable for children).","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Jack Whitehall is a wonderful supporting character, and his interactions with the oddly-cast-yet-oddly-fitting Jesse Plemons make the subplot all the more worthwhile. Paul Giamatti is a hilarious cherry on top to the exposition and ending of this film. The setting of the Amazonian jungle is incredibly well executed and the natural enemies to our adventurers create an awesome contrast between comfort and danger for the pampered crew.The film's story is intriguing and ropes you in from the start; the characters are lovable and, as you would hope for a expedition-centered film, you want the characters to reach the end goal, rather than to happen upon it. The ""subantagonists"" (I'm referring to them as this because the film is more about man vs. Nature) such as the jungle natives and German pursuers make the race for the flower all the more exciting. The twist around 2/3rd in the film actually made my heart race; the overdriven action and freakish demises of a few may make this movie a deal breaker for parents with younger kids, to be totally honest.The cliches in this film (if you've seen it, you know to what I am referring) take away sooo much from my enjoyment. They are honestly the only thing holding me back from giving this movie an 8.If you have younger kids, like 9 or below, it made be wise to hold off on this movie, as there are frequent scenes of high intensity action that could be ""scary"" to little ones. There's even a scene with body horror (or as much as Disney can get away with), and a few jumpscares! All in all, a great film for fans of good actors, but don't go into this movie expecting a Shawshank plot.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Viewed: August 3rd, 2021When you make a PG film these days, not only do you have to entertain the kids, but you have to remember the older viewers as well. You still want to fill these seats with parents, as well as, with kids. If the parents aren't happy they might not bring their kids anymore. You also need to entertain those older viewers without insulting their intelligence. Thinking you can get something past the kids, that the parents won't notice, doesn't always work. It can hurt the trust between the director and the audience. In the case of Jungle Cruise (2021), director Jaume Collet-Serra tries to weave a tale that works for both, but runs into a couple of issues. These issues are minor and there are still some good bright spots found throughout the film.This is a classic tale that has been seen before, but this one is based off of a Disney theme park ride. I actually had the pleasure of taking the Jungle Cruise, while visiting Disney World back in 2018, so that helped give me some insight into the idea behind this movie. I could relate to the film in some way. By no means, do you need to take the ride, in order to enjoy the film, but it helps. It is that classic jungle adventure film, seen throughout film's ages, which includes action, comedy, romance, evil, danger and all the other ingredients needed for this type of film.Emily Blunt plays Lily Houghton, who is much like a female Indiana Jones, who, along with her brother sidekick Aguirre, are trying to track down a legendary plant that could cure all forms of diseases found in the world. Dwayne Johnson plays the river Captain Frank Wolff, who actually does a nice job portraying the one-lined jokester of a captain. Also in the cast, one of the other reasons why I wanted to see this film, is Frank's competitor in the river business, Nilo (Paul Giamatti), doing what he does best as a loan collecting jerk.As, Frank, Lily and Aguirre make their way through the Amazon they are pursued by a German aristocrat named Joachim, who has his own submarine and also wants the power of the plant for his own uses. The film takes place in 1916, so the writers are playing up the idea that the world is gearing up for WWI. Lily actually expresses to Frank that the plant could help with the war effort, so we know the time-period and what is going on in the world at this time. There also is a plot arc that takes place in the 16th century involving early conquistadors, who also searched for the mythical tree and the fate that comes to those who search for it.There is an underlying feeling throughout the film of familiarity and when I figured it out it didn't bother me too much. You can clearly see a Disney-type template in the film, based off of the Pirates of the Caribbean films (2003-2017). The captain, the tough female lead, the weak sidekick, the political aristocrat, the adversary, a curse, a treasure, a ship, supernatural sea creatures, etc. It works for Jungle Cruise, in the fact that those films were PG-13, which allowed the filmmakers to teeter into the sexual innuendos and under-the-cuff jokes that you can't really do in a PG film so much. It helps Jungle Cruise, because there is an invisible wall in-between our two main characters, that doesn't push the unbelievability of romanticism between the two. It allows the film to concentrate on the film's other positive aspects and have fun being humorous with other sections of the plot.The problems arise when we revisit the kids/parents thing mentioned above. In one early scene in the movie, while Frank and Aguirre are trying to get the boat down the river, while being chased by Nilo's men, they are separated from Lily. Unknown to them, she becomes ensnared in a cage full of birds and is hijacked by pirates to be sold on the black market. As her cage is taken into a building the birds are flying above in the air. Down on the river, the boat takes a turn around a bend and Frank sees the birds circling the building. Frank yells, ""Lily!"". How did Frank know that was Lily in the cage? There must have been a scene/shot that was taken out of the film for time constraints, thinking that the kids won't notice the plot flaw here, but forgot that the adults might notice. That was a major plot flaw. There is no indication that Frank or Aguirre noticed what happened to Lily, but you have to keep the movie rolling along.The other thing that was a hard sell involved Emily Blunt's Lily character. She does a fine job executing the positives of the character into an entertaining performance. It just wasn't a good idea to make her look like a seasoned action-hero. I was having a hard time buying that aspect of her character. Sure, she can be tough! Sure, she can be heroic. She can be smart and carry a gun. She can be all those things. Her sexist nickname from Frank is ""Pants"". Another clever commentary about her character and a reminder of the time period, being the fact that the film still inhabits a period in our history when women didn't wear pants. She is tough, but I felt she showed a fearlessness that was too over-the-top. She also had an agility and fighting prowess that could have been like Jackie Chan's. I couldn't buy that character flaw either.The film does manage to entertain the viewer with plenty of action scenes, stunts, nicely crafted CGI landscapes, smart one-line jokes (intended to be stupid jokes, which makes them better when The Rock says them), colorful characters, a complementing soundtrack and a story that carries you to the end. There are just a few continuity, editing and plot flaw mistakes that brings this film down from being really good. It's still a strong film and one that should be seen in the theaters.7.0 (C MyGrade) = 7 IMDB.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

A classic case of having a concept without any idea how to write a story. The characters were entirely unrelatable, unfunny, and predictable. The story was pathetic. The move was generally awful.The only reason this is even watched is because it's made by Disney and it has a well-known and well-liked cast. Why don't people know how to tell stories anymore? Great characters, an exciting plot, an interesting twist. Instead, we get lumbered with no character, a boring plot, and predictable storylines.People don't seem to want to tell stories anymore - CGI and big budgets mean that studios can get away with lazy storytelling as they don't need to necessarily write a good one to engage the audience. If you want to watch a good film with a good story from Disney, watch a Pixar - they (at least for now) know how to tell a story.In short, this film is very exciting for an idle-minded child or your general moron.","17 out of 33 found this helpful.

Full of corny spiel from the lovable boat captains, the experience is nicely evoked in the new Disney movie: a true summer blockbuster that delights.Positives:
Negatives:
Summary Thoughts on ""Jungle Cruise"": This was a pleasant surprise for me. A fun and light-hearted movie that ticks all the boxes as a summer blockbuster. It nicely evokes the cheesiness of the theme park ride operator (past alumni have included Robin Williams and Kevin Costner), especially with Johnson's opening scenes. But then rounds it out as a spectacular and appealing tongue-in-cheek adventure.And, by the way, in case you fancy sitting through the interminable end titles to watch a post-credits scene.... there isn't one.(#takenonefortheteam).Parental Guidance: One question might be whether, with a ""12A"" certificate, this summer blockbuster is one that your kids might enjoy or be freaked out by. A comparison with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is perhaps useful here. There are quite a number of ""jolts"" involving snakes and bees but probably not as bad as the ones you get in an uncut version of ""Raiders"" (think the spiked Satipo; the mummies/snakes when escaping the 'Well of Souls'; and the melting Nazi bad-guys). So if you have kids that lapped up that stuff then I don't think they would have any issues with this one.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web, Facebook or Tiktok. Thanks).","29 out of 54 found this helpful.

And it's not like this is a extremely diverse performance, but it just worked out really well. Emily Blunt just as much, though I'm a fan of her already.In regards to authenticity to the Jungle Cruise ride in Disney land, this will be a treat to watch. There's not too much references but the ones that are there are good.The directing is beautiful. Visually this movie was fantastic. The CGI is pretty good overall, measured to Disney standards, though in some parts overused and a bit lacking in realistic animations. There is a ton of CGI in this movie though, so beware.This adventure movie also managed to not make me bored during its 2 hour runtime. Yes... you do have to sit through some of the clichés. But they are short enough that you don't really mind.The script is your typical romantic adventure treasure hunt movie. Fine. But you can predict everything in this movie. The spectacle and visuals made up for it though.Now, there is a bit of ''in your face'' social messaging regarding gender roles, which I thought for the lead actress and her role was fine. Because it had the right payoff. But they shoehorned the romantic preference for the brother. I did not have a payoff, it was just kinda.. there.But all in all, just good old adventurous fun 7/10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Movie Review -Disney seems to be doing fine now days with several remakes and adaptations. Those golden days of Disney won't come back now as they were ruling this Fantasy Adventure Genre like nobody else. One of the biggest attraction in this millenium was 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' (2003), and the entire series to some extent. The next films in this series couldn't match the first one and recently their last film in the franchise was way lower in terms of set standards. People aren't much happy with the news of POTC franchise being shelved forever and that new POTC Film with the female character in lead role had already been lashed out even before the first look release. Audience is missing such films now days and this new flick in Disney's amusing park - Jungle Cruise may please audience somewhat on a fair level, if not high. Jungle Cruise is entertaining and quite interesting with fantasy theories too but the most beautiful thing about the film is, it tries to use those old lost tools of Classic Films like Pirates Of The Caribbean and Indian Jones (first three films).It is based on Disneyland's theme park ride where a small riverboat takes a group of travelers through a jungle filled with dangerous animals and reptiles but with a supernatural element. This might remind of 'POTC : On Stranger Tides' and somewhat of Indiana Jones as well. It uses the same old tricks and even if it is too outdated, it still works because of new storyline. The problem is, all this is too mainstream and outdated for 2021, so naturally it becomes highly predictable. The only thing that keeps it interesting is the audience's interest over the same old fantasy adventure tales. There are few things which are just too annoying such as the love story, that's damn too boring and extremely common climax. Thankfully, the film does not drag much and remains steady overall to keep you on board.Dwayne Johnson plays an interesting character, Frank, something unimaginable but who cares when you are in Disney's fantasy park? So, he's quite enjoyable, something what Barbossa did for POTC in negative role, Frank does in positive way. Emily Blunt is rough and tough, very very lovable in almost every scene. Whether it is action, intelligence or tricks, her character has everything. Rest of the cast is okay, nothing much to added here. All the action scenes in the film are shot beautifully with the help of eye pleasing visual effects. Talking about the writing, it's nothing new but still reasonable and pretty complete. The screenplay could have been better though, especially is in the middle portion where it opens all the secrets and leaves nothing for the climax.Jaume Collet-Serra as the captain of the ship takes this cruise through pleasant Adventures. He might have forgot to add couple of twists and tricks which might have worked as surprise elements but it's not a big issue. Few quirky characters would have helped too but it's too much to ask for from Johnson and Blunt. Overall, a little flips here and there but the cruise finds its destination without any big blunders. For today's fantasy adventure flicks, even having this much is too much so Enjoy It!RATING - 6/10*","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

Screenwriters have really tried hard to include some punch lines and stupid comedies, but as of today's film standards those comedies are far outdated and frankly speaking shouldn't be even considered funny by children. It wasn't an adventure movie at all as far the name suggests, moreover just running the scripts to end the film. I suppose Disney have lost the charm. Total waste of 2 hours and the money that was spent for creating this pathetic cruise. Would recommend just to watch it once and never think about it again.","38 out of 85 found this helpful.

(Unexpected great chemistry between both actors) There is great character diversity and the imagery is beautiful. There are two sets of villains. The Germans are a bit repetitive to raiders and provide the least amount of entertainment, luckily the conquistadors save that. The action scenes are brilliant and bring similar thrills that made the made the first 3 pirates films and Indiana Jones so fun.

The movie became even better with some plot twists that I did not expect and some very clever details that were presented. The interpretations of both Emily Blunt who played as Lily Houghton and Dwayne Johnson who played as Frank Wolff were very good and their combination worked very well. The direction which was made by Jaume Collet-Serra it was also very good and he succeeded on creating a bond between his main characters and the audience.

I like Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, but they both felt a bit out of their depth here, probably because of the INSANE amounts of bad CGI. I just watched Dune. I know bad CGI vs. Good CGI and The Jungle Cruise has BAD CGI.

That's what you are in for! Though more Uncharted than the almost-perfect-script the Mummy movie has. It does share many elements, and some of the structure as well. Probably why it is a good release (the old tried and true). If you know not of either, you could compare it to a Pirates of the Caribbean.. which is adequate, as this being based on a Disney ride as well.It is a ""fun"" adventure with fantastic elements, a ""treasure"" to seek, and villains to put a damper on the hero's journey. But in the end, it feels somewhat hollow.. as if it didn't stick the landing or it missed something to tie it all together. The Lore itself is a bit lacking, and the tone is weird, although not entirely bad.STILL! Animal and Jungle Visual Effects are impressive at times. As is the added artistic style throughout (be it the little map animation or enchanting credits, as well). Good characters, interactions and many of the OBNOXIOUS skipper jokes we all love.I might not watch it again (I might, if I completely forget about it ), but I would still recommend it for a Friday-night.** Also.. for a movie with a Spanish cast (which is very good, although too much on the side).. couldn't they help the Rock with his pronunciation?","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Proxima the jaguar was the cutest though... Some of the monsters CGI was kinda ugly but that doesn't matter when you have a great movie all around. It can't reach the heights of the first Pirates movie but nevertheless better than all 4 sequels and overall amazing movie.

All I knew was that it was PG-13 and the Rock was in it, so I had no idea exactly what to expect other than it was going to be something to do with the jungle and something to do with a cruise.The plot is a basic adventure story with a few twists thrown in here and there. In some ways it was reminiscent of Pirates of the Caribbean Curse of the Black Pearl.Because I don't want to give anything away I will just say, the best part of the movie for me was hearing my 12-year-old laugh at the corny dad jokes and some of the other scenes in the movie because if you can make her laugh out loud at some silliness then you've produced a good movie.I give this 4 out of 5 of my own arbitrary popcorn awards🍿🍿🍿🍿","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

Which is Joseph Conrad's ""Heart Of Darkness"" But let's be even more frank, they drew nearly all inspiration from ""The African Queen"" which is why Dwayne looks the way he does. Yes, I suppose Universal Studios could sue Disney for stealing the template to ""The Mummy"" (1998). But, hey...hope Disney steals a ""Fast..."" storyline at some point.This movie is fun. And that's all you should be concerned about. For those who forgive Marvel movies for the same offenses, sorry you refuse to draw the same comparisons. Perhaps you are too dense to see how often they cycle through the same stories. And too illiterate to see they hide their references well.This movie wants you to like it. Emily wants you to like her. And that is admirable.Forget the woke-ness of its message. In any other world the ""plucky"" Blunt would be knocked cold from any male dockworker. So you already know this is a fantasy already, since she can defend herself against the roughnecks (I dare her to pretend to do so in real life). But she's eye-candy to the King Kong, which is The Rock. And that's all she's called on to do.Have fun.

"6","/10","It's the kind of journey that you would enjoy once, but not twice.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8038852/?ref_=tt_urv","nataliabatsko","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur145118680/?ref_=tt_urv","6 April 2022","Despite the fact that this isn't Disney's first adaptation of a theme park ride (Pirates of Carribean, Ghost mansion and Tomorrowland already got theirs), this is my first experience with these types of movies. Back in Summer 2021 my mom watched this movie and absolutely loved it. She even told me that this is a must watch, since according to her, it was a good fairy tale. So I gave it a try. And I wasn't disappointed.The story centres around an adventurous heroine Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) who has one goal in mind: find the legendary petals called the tears of the moon that can heal any sickness along with her brother MacGregor (Jack Whitehall). But no one believes them and think that they're joking, especially due to the fact that Lily is a female scientist and back then, no one took them seriously. So both set themselves on a journey to find the petals with the help of Frank Skipper (Dwayne Johnson), while also avoiding Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons) who also wants the rare objects to himself.Let's start with the good stuff! First of we have the visuals! They are really bright and colorful. Not only the jungle itself, but also the cgi animals that live in like pink Dolphins, talking parrots and a pet jagaur named Proxima. All were amazingly and realistically done. Second of all, the main characters were likeable. With Lily, we truly support her during the dangerous journey and believe that she will succeed. She's a smart and witty protogonist, whose performance by Emily Blunt was a step up from her role as Rita Vratarski in Edge of tomorrow (which was bad and bland). There's another character named Frank Skipper portrayed by the Rock himself. At first he seems like a silly and goofy sailor who likes telling unfunny jokes and later tries to tell Lily that the adventure itself is a rather risky one. But later in the movie, he tells a backstory about his past (which is a huge spoiler, but it's similar to Maui's in Moana.), which explains why he's constantly working as a Skipper in a cruise for a long period of time. But that ""cannibal"" jungle tribe was mostly forgettable, I mean, they give more context to the story, but as characters, they're not as great as the main duo. I can't say anything about MacGregor either. He's was pretty bland in my opinion, because he doesn't progress the plot in any way. But he was a little bit funny when he tried to interract with Proxima and he thought that the jaguar's going to eat him while all she wanted is to play. The worst element of the movie has to be the villain. Let's just say that he's a very crazy prince who wants to get the petals away from Houghton and use them for evil purposes. He feels out of place for a fantasy feature like this by being a historical figure. It just feels like a sore thumb. Also the ending was very predictable when all characters reach the mystery cave. Again, I won't spoil anything, but if you've seen Moana or any other film like this, then you know what's going to happen, which is sad, because I was invested in the journey and the ending was just generic.As for the acting, I think that everyone was invested in their performance, which makes the roles that they are portraying believable for the audience. Especially Johnson and Blunt, who felt perfect for Skipper and Lily respectively!But regardless of what I've said, Jungle Cruise is a decent flick if you want to have a family movie night or just to watch it if you feel bored and want something whimsical and magical, yet interesting and with an adventurous tone. Disney fans may either enjoy this or not, depending on each fan. As for people who are not interested in such movies, it's better to skip it. I thought it was alright, it had cool ideas to work with, and they were executed nicely. It's just not the most memorable movie done by Disney.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

They know that, in order to do that, they have to make movies like Jungle Cruise, so they do. But they're very careful not to enforce any traditional ideas of gender or morality, but rather to gently tip the scales in the direction of progressivism. As long as their movies accomplish that, they're glad to continue to entertain, and this movie is definitely entertaining.That said, Emily Blunt shines in this film, as she so often does. Johnson is charismatic, as well. Credit where credit is due, both of these actors have staying power for a reason, and they're wonderful together. Also, the music and cinematography definitely whisk you away to the magical world of Disney and you're glad to go for the ride.Like lots of modern films, the simple story starts to get bogged down by too many moving parts plot-wise, and the CGI distracts, from time to time. For adults, it will annoy occasionally, but for kids, they'll eat it up.Speaking of the kids, I encourage parents to not put their parenting on hold, just because you're watching a ""Disney"" film. On the contrary, watching a Disney film circa 2021 means you BETTER be involved as a parent, as you watch with your kids, and Jungle Cruise definitely makes that clear. It's a different world now, and we can't pretend otherwise, But for the most part, Jungle Cruise helps us forget that for a while, and does so with aplomb.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's a Disney movie, so ya know... I expected the usual cheese fest... but it actually wasn't bad! It even had hubby's attention the entire time, which is highly unusual. Didn't look at his phone once (a true rarity). We both had more than a few laughs.I grew up going to Disneyland at least once a year, so the movie was very nostalgic for me in the beginning.Emily Blunt steals every scene she's in, as per usual. Jack Whitehall... yes, please, I'll take as much of him as I can get. I've seen The Rock in way worse roles than this one. He is his usual cute self.Anyway, this movie is great fun and even slightly ""naughty"" for Disney, what with the alcohol and the gay character and the interracial romance. The movie is rather phantasmagorical in parts, but it's all in good fun; it's rather creative, and we had a great time watching it.The only super cheesy part in the movie was the ending, which I expected because... it's a Disney movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

He's the most dynamic actor in this film and his comedic performance as the Prince hits on so many levels. I don't think this film would have been as enjoyable with anyone else in the role. Dwayne Johnson delivers a performance that is slightly less ""The Rock"" than the vast majority of his films, and I'll give credit to the director for forcing some comedic nuance into that performance since it's something I really haven't seen from him before or since. For example, in Red Notice, he's back to playing The Rock all over again. It's a safe thing to do, why bother with exploring acting skills and giving a unique performance? That's not what he gets paid for. He gets paid to be The Rock in blockbuster films. It's chancy to mess with the formula when a few hundred million investment dollars are on the line.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is what one should expect from a movie called ""Jungle Cruise"" by Disney. It's not terrible, it's definitely not boring. I honestly enjoyed it as much as I would have enjoyed a budget horror/thriller film filled with cheap scares. I guess, cliché becomes cliché because it is easy to entertain people.

Director Jaume Collet-Serra has given us a film that's entertaining but, not entertaining enough. There is barely any genuine humor in the movie & a lot of tedious exposition. Dwayne Johnson's Jumanji franchise is so much better. The action set pieces are fantastic. The visual effects are phenomenal. Dwayne Johnson is brilliant as Frank Wolff. Emily Blunt is spectacular as Lily Houghton. Johnson & Blunt share this effortless camaraderie in all their scenes together. Edgar Ramirez is effective as Aguirre. Jack Whitehall is amazing as MacGregor Houghton. Jesse Plemons is outstanding as Prince Joachim. Plemons' performance is the highlight of the film & I wish he had more screen time. Paul Giamatti is good as Nilo Nemolato. The supporting cast is impressive. Jungle Cruise is worth a watch if you're a Dwayne Johnson & Emily Blunt fan. Just keep your expectations relatively low.

In essence, it's a mesh of Pirates of the Caribbean and The Mummy, with the former being the bigger influence. It's nowhere on their level of quality, though, but in the pursuit of that, it does end up being entertaining enough that it is a decent watch. Adventure escapism.The Rock and his charismatic self in the jungle (shocker) with the charming and gorgeous Emily Blunt make a fine duo, easily the strongest part of the movie. They work well off each other. Their banter, them one-upping each other, the eventual romance, it was fun. Add in a side-kick brother extra comic relief character and a cool pet and you get a team that you can certainly get behind in a journey through the Amazon.The villains, though, were lame. Jesse Plemons as the German prince was hilarious at times but they goofed him up too much. Way too cartoony. The discount Captain Barbossa could have been the intense one instilling some much-needed thrills and tension but I guess Disney just doesn't like going there anymore.Visually, the movie can be a looker at times, especially with some creative transitions and cool cinematography. BUT it is also overly reliant on CGI and as an adventure movie trying to mimic those classic ones, it falls way too short in terms of giving you that REAL feel by going on location or having proper massive sets and having a nice blend with CGI. The greenscreen usage is also apparent in several areas taking away from the good shots and giving you that ""ugly"" feeling. The OST wasn't anything special but did the job.The plot is a standard adventure mystery affair. One person is trying to find a mystery, hires a specialist to help them traverse the locale and chaos ensue. A few twists here and there but nothing major or shocking. Still enjoyed the dedication to the adventure vibe. However, I did not like how the movie is 2 hours long and yet it feels as if it's running, perhaps has something to do with the editing because there were far too many cuts. Let moments breathe.All in all, not a bad time if you're looking for an adventure movie. A bit too childish but still enjoyable. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 6/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie's pace is on point, Action on point, CG Effects 'Well done.But I finished the movie with a slight empty feeling.Couldn't put my finger on it for a while. Then it clicked. The soundtrack / Score. To me a great adventure movie should have a memorable soundtrack. When we hear the Jaws theme, We know it, Indiana Jones, Halloween, Jurassic Park. These scores make a movie great. I found the music to be a very generic orchestral score. It's strange, James Newton Howard has scored some great movies in the past, and his soundtracks have been noteworthy. Here not so much. All in all a great movie, slightly let down by a score that just isn't memorable.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Jungle cruise is much of a crowd pleaser film. There is something for everyone, from Dwayne's funny play on word jokes(I have to admit I laughed at most of them, even the guilty pleasure ones!) to Emily Blunt's heroine mishaps, to Jack Whitehall's dry humour. For the first half an hour if your a real movie buff you will notice the uncanny resemblance to the first Mummy(1999). Very similar characters and Very similar story line. But I won't give anything away and even tho very similar, Jungle Cruise proves it is in fact it's own vehicle. It is a welcome return to the summer blockbuster genre, big, loud and most importantly, fun. I have no doubt there will be a sequel as this first adventure proves to be something worth watching. It does get a bit like Pirates, but again, I won't spoil anything. If you know what you like, and this looks like you're kinda thing then watch it as you probably won't be disappointed. Dwayne and Emily's chemistry again proves they knew what they were doing as it is a lot of fun watching the two play off one another. The film slows down a bit in the middle act but before you have time to complain, it roars back into the adventure and fun for the finale. A good fun time for all the family, unless you're looking to take it all seriously, in which case, as Logan would say.....""you picked the wrong film bub!"" Hope this has been helpful and wish you all the best. Until the next time.....May the force be with you.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I expected some charm and cheesy jokes, setting a super low bar for this one, and I truly couldn't wait for it to be over. The dynamic between Blunt and Johnson was forced and bland.

But also the most thrilling.""A skipper and an intrepid researcher, along with her brother, travel through the Amazon whilst searching for an ancient tree with unparalleled healing abilities. The unlikely pair encounter innumerable dangers and supernatural forces, all lurking in the deceptive beauty of the lush rainforest. Jungle Cruise is another adaption from one of Disney World's most beloved rides, and creates a whole adventure from the experience. Disney has had some success with their film adaptions of rides, most notably Pirates of the Caribbean, but the others have fallen short from something memorable. Jungle Cruise exceeded my expectations. It doesn't suffer from trying to find some logical story when the ride has none. Now, that isn't to say this is great or anything. Beneath all of the fun action scenes and excitement, it's a fairly basic story that we've seen a time or two. It takes inspiration from such classics as Romancing the Stone and The Goonies. Sometimes it feels like it's trying to make up for its average storytelling with all the diverting bustle. Honestly, it takes a good 30 minutes of setting up before getting into the promised boat ride. It's smooth sailing for a bit, but without compelling antagonists and a few twists (one being a bit far-stretched), it can't reach the level it thinks it's at.If anything succeeds, it's the chemistry of the two leads. The two are wildly entertaining and perfectly cast in their roles. They're good with the comedy, especially with The Rock's puns straight from the ride, and Blunt has all the skills of an adventurous soul ready for anything. Jack Whitehall slowly grew on me as the movie progressed almost making him feel like a lead as well. Overall, I nice choice of actors. On the ride, we're given beautiful sceneries of the Amazon. A few of the visual effects needed some work, surprisingly when it's just the back ground while on the boat, but it's pleasant to look at. Director Jaume Collet-Serra had big plans for the movie, but may have overstuffed it a bit. What it needed was some time to breathe. Constantly, something is happening, so when we get though slower moments it can ruin the pacing. Most of it comes from time taken to tell a backstory that isn't all that remarkable. But I guess some of the information is helpful. Jungle Cruise is an alright movie. Nothing super notable but a pretty enjoyable movie. With the lack of adventurous movies and ones kids would be interested in (even though this is PG-13), this has been a hit with most general moviegoers. If you're not expecting too much, this is worth the watch. And maybe if you are expecting big things, this could be for you.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The plot is a standard adventure that follows all the beats viewers have become accustomed to. Meanwhile, the cliché romance is about as predictable as a Hallmark movie. Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson are enjoyable and elevate the material with their skills and charisma, but, unfortunately, the lack of genuine surprises stifles genuine engagement. Competency is present in this film but without heart, it all rings hollow.On a technical level, the verdict is the same. The shot selection is adequate without being unique or interesting. The rugged production design is good but undercut by the sterile CGI (which is grossly over-used). The soundtrack is fitting yet forgettable. And the editing does little to impact the experience in a meaningful way. Ultimately, Jungle Cruise takes proven elements of other movies without providing anything new of its own, leaving audiences to accept it as a decent production but forget it as soon as it's over.Writing: 4/10

A side story if you want to call it that.Having the Rock and Emily Blunt in the leading roles is really helping out a lot. Actually wanted to watch this in cinemas. And while as I already said does copy things from previous adventure movies (new and old ones that is), the actors and the effects keep it fresh to an extend.

After watching Jungle Cruise, i just wanna pretend that this movie was made by other company and not Disney, because Disney already releasing Cruella in May and that movie still my pick for best films of the year so far, so Disney already releasing a great yet dark film and they must releasing the light one too, Jungle Cruise is the one, my main problem in this movie is unfortunately the main duo, Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, it's the same case for me like Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater in True Romance, Johnson and Blunt was very good when they are separated, but when they're together, the performance become a mess, for Johnson it was alright, for Blunt it was alright too but sometime it's bad, why?, because they're chemistry is not there, and until one of the last scene of the movie, i started to see it and feel it, but that's it, and that was my main problem and the others was just some cringe and stupid scene but not much, now there is still a fun and good thing in Jungl e Cruise, and the best thing in the movie was the action, James Newton Howard score, and Jesse Plemons amazing performance, those three things really helping this movie and my rating for the movie, Jungle Cruise is almost an ok movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was expecting a sloppy and lazy story, instead I admit that I have enjoyed this old-style adventure quite a bit. It reminded me a lot of those films released during the 90s and the first 2000s. It does not reinvent the wheel, but it is nice to just watch a simple and at times cheesy movie, especially when you just want to relax and you are not up to convoluted or serious stories. Disney also this time had to follow his political agenda, but I am happy that it was reduced to the minimum. Finally, not a movie made for SJWs. If they want to represent minorities and communities, screenwriters need to create more balanced scripts that give more space to the story, like in this case. I liked the locations and the director managed to take me into this fantasy world full of mysteries, the forest is stunning and very colorful, the conquistadores are very peculiar enemies, with different abilities. The main villain is cheesy and funny, I liked Jesse Plemons performance as Prince Joachim. He is funny, and had little screen time, which I think was a good choice. He had his little narrative arc and added the right amount of comedy, then he left when he needed to leave.""Jungle Cruise"" is very balanced and the cast did a good job. Well, with an actress such as Emily Blunt, I was not expecting otherwise. The Rock was pretty decent in the supporting role. Two hours is the correct length for this title, I never felt bored or annoyed and it kept me until the very end, which is what a film is supposed to do. I personally recommend it if you just want to have fun with your family or friends.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is your typical treasure hunting adventure movie set in the WW1 era. I felt the movie was an amalgam of Jumanji and Indiana Jones. I was impressed with the CGI and the jungle setting.The Good - I loved the way they used Nothing Else Matters by Metallica theme. Or was it? Not exactly sure if this is a copyright. I was impressed by the portrayals of the actors involved. Dwayne Johnson was in his typical hero saves the day mode. What was surprising was the character played by Jesse Plemons. I had seen him in Breaking Bad and absolutely despised him, however he plays antagonistic roles well along with comedy. The costumes, themes and cinematography make this movie a delight to watch.The Bad - Well, the plot is banal. I have seen so many treasure movies which feature a jungle, tribals, 1900-esque setting and curses. The CGI and the cinematography involved was good but in some places the CGI was sketchy.Overall, it's a fun movie to watch. No matter how repeated the plot is, I love adventure and fantasy movies. Watch it if you want to kill time :)","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Everything was so overly choreographed to the point that I never felt any danger.So much violence for a Disney film and I don't mind violence but it seemed like every 3 minutes there was a 5-minute action scene with fighting.You knew nothing about the characters and characters don't matter anymore in Hollywood, because it's all plot, action and special effects.Everything was done with 100% foley and voice over which made it sterile. I know it's supposed to be a ride, but can we have a minute break without the camera and actors moving? It was nauseating. I don't think they stayed on one shot more than 3 seconds without an edit. Try to find 10 seconds in the film where they didn't cut to another shot. Good luck.The editing was so disjointed. From medium, to close up, to wide, to close, to medium, to profile etc. And it was only done to keep up ""the energy"" but instead was too distracting.And then the annoying score. It was wall-to-wall music telling us how to feel.Also what was really annoying was the constant rack focus, which was likely done in post, but I kept thinking stuff was out of focus to then realize they were focusing on one actor, and then 2 seconds later they rack-focused on another actor in the same shot. Bizarre.Every action was forced by the characters, which is a sign of bad writing. Don't create actions in a film driven by deliberate poor decisions from the characters. For example, if someone tells you, you will die if you got that way, and then you insist on going that way you are letting poor decisions create the action rather than letting the action come to them.This movie epitomizes the majority of films in Hollywood, all rides, no heart.Lastly, the Jaguar looked so fake.There is a reason why this bombed. Do better, Hollywood.","12 out of 27 found this helpful.

Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt are fun to watch, and compliment each other's characters well. Jack Whitehall's character brings a bit of balance to the intentionally inflated bravado of the other two and helps to form a fun, adventuring trio. This movie has clear inspirations from several recognizable action/adventure franchises, but overall it successfully shows that it has a lot of heart on its own.It's a bit lengthy and complex as it seems like several story ideas were possibly merged into one, incorporating heavy involvement from
more than one antagonist. Use of CGI becomes more and more evident in certain scenes (a la Pirates of the Caribbean) which always seems to slightly diminish the stakes in these adventure stories with their otherwise earthy, antique settings.Overall, a fun movie that tries to represent the spirit of the attraction it's based on fairly well.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

However, what makes it such a forgettable let-down is the procedure of discovering that it drags you out to... no point. This dull but enjoyable Disney journey, quite living up to the title 'Jungle Cruise', is a real drag to nothing. That's what's most disappointing about the film. What makes it feel like a slow haul is the predictable design to the brim with uninteresting fantasy material and a lame antagonist.And it's seriously not just the villain of the tale who is unexciting; each of the lead heroes, including the characters played by Emily Blunt, Dwayne Johnson and Jack Whitehall, are partially dreary. And cannot rescue how tedious the adventure can get.The main point is that although the acting is strongly satisfactory and its plan missed the target, Jungle Cruise is pretty entertaining. There's no doubt against the fact that the majority of Disney adventure fans will leave pleased and fulfilled after this tale. It doesn't necessarily mean that viewers are best left to experiencing the journey in cinemas, but why not class it as true popcorn fun?If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Arriving at the Amazon where the tree is said to be hidden, she enlists skipper Frank Wolff to take her there on his rather dilapidated boat. However, all is not as it seems. Cue lots of actioning and adventuring. Yes, this is indeed an action adventure film...I was skeptical that this was going to be, well, a bit crap... but I was pleasantly surprised. All the characters are interesting and acted well, the sets are amazing (I still can't believe they built that whole riverside town from scratch), and the plot was interesting enough to keep me engaged, despite playing second fiddle to the action. The bad guys were also pretty great. In fact the only real downside was Jack Whitehall's character, who was extremely irritating and completely unnecessary, a bit like Jack Whitehall himself come to think of it. All in all, I found this extremely watchable and entertaining, and is a better adventure film than any Indiana Jones released this millennium...","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Jungle Cruise follows the Pirates of the Caribbean ""let's make a fantasy/adventure movie out of a Disneyland attraction"" style and it does it decently, I'll give it that. It's fun, it's entertaining, it's original ish, and nobody can deny the strong chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt.It's not the most original movie in the world. Actually, it's kind of what you'd get if you take The Mummy (1999) and the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, throw the two in a blender a see what happens. It has resourceful things from both worlds and it's inevitable to think of them but, at the same time, it does it with its own style, and that's what works. So you get exactly what you were looking for: an entertaining enough summer adventure for the family, or that kind of movie you'd watch during a boring and rainy Sunday evening when you don't have any plans and don't wanna think too much, just press ""Play"", laugh and enjoy it.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Easy targets for their era I guess..The CGI seems to cover the screen 80% from start to finish and makes star wars look like a documentary.If youve never seen IJ or Mummy films, thrn it will work and entertain but it felt so Deja Vu I just struggled to get past their similarities.","12 out of 29 found this helpful.

Same with Jack Whitehall. He plays the brother well and when he gets in on the action it's convincing for his character.Jesse Plemons plays a little hammy as the evil German, not a Nazi, and surprisingly brings some good comic relief. The conquistadors are also cool visually and are good as the henchmen. There backstory adds just enough to the story as well.The twist for the Rocks character was one I didn't see coming and was surprised by.Scenery is beautiful as well. The characters aren't super fleshed out and play one note but they don't need to be more than they are.Overall this is the second best Indiana Jones movie that isn't Indiana Jones only behind the Brendan Fraser led The Mummy.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Leaving this aside, we have the other big problem: the mission loses interest as credulity is lost. The fantasy behind heroes and villains evaporates any chance of being interested in the plot and it does not work on almost any level. Leaving aside the promotion of acceptance and empowerment values to which Disney has us accustomed, I must say it with all the letters: the film is not original and it hardly stands up.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

He makes himself more and more powerful with each passing movie, whether it makes sense of not. The Rock is right about one thing.

But it was all in good fun , but they were kind of scary, but I loved every second of it no matter what! I read the reviews and wanted to check it out myself. One thing I didn't understand were the comments referencing other movies that had been done better, I did not see that at all, I saw some slices of Raiders but this thing felt like it did it's own unique thing and did it well! It was totally adorable across the board , cute sweet and very funnny and the play on words I found to enrich my heart with some sort of good vibes and infused me with jolly feelings. I really enjoyed this from beginning to end, I did not see any plot holes cause it explained everything that it needed to and it was interlarded with witticisms and quips and tons of cool stuff! I highly recommend it , but just a couple of times with the angry conquistadors I found myself a lil' too scared! But that's OK, cause it all worked out! :) Anyway I loved it!

The things that the main attraction of the movie Emily Blunt does and the things that happens around her makes her character fun and clunky. Director Jaume Collet-Serra presented this adventure in such a way that in every other scene we see we try to connect it with a movie we have watched before. Clearly the word jungle has enough predecessors but the main thing we remember while watching this film is Jack Sparrow and his adventures. Dwayne Johnson has also given a fun and enjoyable performance. When it comes to pacing, even though the runtime is almost two hours it feels very fast paced. Editing and transitions needed more attention to it. The story isn't something really extraordinary or very good but if we see it totally then it's enjoyable. Overall it's a movie you may or may not enjoy for the second time but for the first time you definitely would like to see the flamboyant duo of Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson are actually GREAT together. The chemistry, the vibe and the humor that they display with each other is perfect for this movie. Jungle Cruise itself isn't perfect but it's a total typical Disney fun film. It has a very Pirates of the Caribbean/Indiana Jones (and Anaconda Hunt for the Blood Orchid if you've seen that) vibe to it with cool music moments and even some romance!If you've been on the ride at Disney a bunch of times you will get a lot more of the jokes then if you are not familiar. The ride Jungle Cruise at Disney is KNOWN for its corny dad jokes, if you bring your dad beware of the dumb jokes that will crack him up! Its a movie any Disney family will love, although small kids might get scared or repulsed at some parts.Cons:
Its nothing new. It will remind you of so many movies when you watch it that it could be a little disappointing because it's not anything out of the ordinary for a Disney movie. They didn't get a little creative in the slightest. If you like Dwayne Johnson you will love this movie, if you're wanting to watch him do something different when it comes to his acting, you're out of luck.There are moments where you feel a little bit of a political message with sexual orientation, feminism (in the early 1900s) and animal rights. Although thats not all bad it can be annoying and out of place for a science fiction movie that takes place in the jungle. Also, the beginning of the film has a slow start.All in all though it is still enjoyable! It's cheap fun entertainment (unless you paid 30 bucks on Disney+) Go watch it for yourself and take a run through the jungle! I gave it a 7/10.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

This action adventure appears to be a direct descendent of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), The Mummy (1999); Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), and National Treasure (2004). Somehow this movie version almost becomes a parody but does not and mostly succeeds in breaking a little new ground in its action sequences and storyline offering its audience more refreshing than expected experience. The animated big cat and several other special effects still have not quite established the maturity of the authenticity needed to completely win over skeptical audience members. And several places in the movie where there are an obvious attempts at live comedic staged reaction that almost fails and loses their timing and punch as well as offering up a few unbelievable staging and remarkable recovery scenes that defy reason to the point of almost breaking the movie fantasy this action adventure that has been casting its spell over the audience.

The music is standout, but what does not work in this films favour is the length of the movie itself and the chemistry between the two leads. You simply cant believe there is any real chemistry between the two. Heck, Jack Whitehall had more chemistry with the big cat in the film than Blunt and Johnson. But nearly everything is done well by Disney in this case and I recommend this one for the kids and family on a Sunday night in.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Basing the story on characters undertaking a dangerous journey based on a myth was a thin premise and done too many times before. Adding supernatural elements was silly. I wasn't a fan of the amount of alcohol consumption portrayed in it, especially since this is supposed to be a kid friendly movie. It was not a good message. Also, the whole myth aspect weren't good messages either. Added to that was the steeling by the supposedly good people. I actually feel that this movie has a lot of things which are bad for kids to see in the portrayed positivity. That being said, I do like how the gay reference was done in a Disney film, although I would have liked it better if the guy was portrayed as more competent. His character at least developed during the film. I liked how they critiqued the sexism of the time and had the female lead be a strong character.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I think I really wanted to like this movie? But in the end there were some fatal flaws: (1) Dwayne Johnson's character, while entertaining and believable just had really poor chemistry with Emily Blunt. I kind of felt like I was watching 2 siblings kiss at the end. It was just awkward.... terrific actors, but terrible romance on screen (2) The special effects were cool, and I loved the scenery, but some of the main happenings in the movie had been stolen from other movies almost polar-by-play, for example, in the scene where Emily Blunt steals the arrow-head from the library and falls off the ladder - kind of a big part of the Movie the Mummy -- some of the elements of the movie also felt like a nod back to Pirate of the Caribbean...in the end, elements of the movie just were not unique enough to be considered on their own merit. I've said it lots, but honestly the movie writers are just copying the SAME. DAMN. OLD. MOVIE. Over and over again! Please stop! Get your own ideas Gens Y and Z. In the end, I felt like they could have done a TON of stuff with a theme of Conquistadors, but they just didn't do any research and they didn't use their brains to try to make something more creative. There were some cheap laughs with the tribe knowing Dwayne Johnson, etc. Which were nice fluff, but in the end the plot just wasn't there to make a hearty movie. A Cheap/Corny Blockbuster through and through, but I guess it had a Disney ""feel good ending"" which I liked, so I wouldn't refuse watching it again if forced.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

The chemistry between the two leads just about works and the inspired addition of Jack Whitehall joining their expedition up the Amazon provides some of the light relief.There are times when the CGI effects completely take over the visuals, which are all very pretty and perfect, but it can take you out of the reality of the situation and remind you this is pure fantasy based on the long running Disneyland ride.Director Jaume Collet-Serra, who impressed with the Liam Neeson thriller The Commuter (2018), keeps things moving at a fast pace and composer James Newton Howard compliments the visuals in much the same way as John Williams complimented Indiana Jones.The film throws everything in, from mythical fantasy to the supernatural to German baddies chasing our heroes around the Amazon, it does start to feel a little bloated at times. By the end you don't feel as though you've been in the jungle like you did in the African Queen as so much goes on, but if it's a spectacular thrill ride you're after then this brings it on in spades.My only gripe is would they really be able to navigate a submarine up the Amazon?","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is jam packed with action from start to finish which is entertaining and the film had a fitting conclusion. The story and legend could have been explained better and the plot felt very flimsy.

The whole thing is wrapped up nicely with a few strange villains getting what they deserve. Well, this would be better if it was in a magical world like Peter Pan, but in our world, it was a bit over the top incongruous. A few things were predictable. I gave it a 6 because I did not feel like sleeping during the film, but I was getting tired of the magic at the end. It was a bit long.

It is nothing more than a visual treat with enough moments to cherish. Coming to performance, Emily Blunt's cuteness and beauty stands above all and feels just like a cherry on top of the cake adding to the positives of the movie. Adventure sequences with some standard CGI/VFX sequences succeed in providing the engaging sequences that form the major part of the movie. Surprising additions like the unexpected suspense and the way they dealt it with the rock music was thoroughly entertaining. Creepy elements and some violence makes this one a stand out among Disney movies. Last but not the least the vibe frames and the light heart moments also adds to the delight the film provides.However, the adventure took its own time to become engaging, till then there are some lag and dull moments. The climax is a typical disney one which feels to be pushed after a near proper ending serious sequence.In the end, Jungle Cruise can be classified as one of the better watchable adventure of the year.Rating:65%","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

When I heard the idea for this film I excepted very little, especially with the very limited source material. However. This movie was a pleasant surprise. Emily Blunt gives a convincing and exhilarating performance, while Dwayne Johnsons character plays well as the exact opposite of Blunts. The movie stays close to the ride without relying too much on the attraction. The side characters contribute a considerable amount and have many shining moments. Some issues arrive in this film for me with its Italian Caricature. This ""Funny"" character is not believable and very stereotypical, never provided a laugh. Other than this the movie never takes any considerable risks but stays true to the Disney formula and succeeds at it. This is a great adventurous family film that should be seen in theatre for best experience.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

An adventurous, scholarly woman and her dandy brother hire a roguish guide to find a mysterious ancient prize, which sounds a lot like the plot of the 1999 Mummy film, just with water instead of sand, and Jack Whitehall can hit harder than John Hannah. And just like the first Pirates of the Caribbean drew a lot of inspiration from the Disney ride, they both added a supernatural twist to their source material, though it was good they kept in so many puns from the rides Skippers.Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson compliment each other in the physical humour, while Jesse Plemons plays their mad German adversary as though he was auditioning for Indiana Jones. That could also be true for the more spiritual enemies the trio encounter; not sure how Indy would get on facing Edgar Ramírezs suitably slithery Aguirre. Personally, I think the film could have done with one set of human baddies, and the perils of the jungle river increased, but the film still works.The CGI is unsurprisingly wonderful, with a suitable number of wild animals running, jumping, splashing and other such natural activities that at times leave their human counterparts looking pretty animated in comparison.An action packed adventure, with plenty of twists, if ultimately a predictable outcome.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Not necessarily a bad thing but usually indicates a wafer thin plot and screenplay.However, Jungle Cruise is a fun action adventure, family friendly, film that harks back to older movies such as Indiana Jones and Romancing the Stone. So if you take it with a pinch of salt and as a popcorn movie where you leave your brain at the door, it is actually very fun. Dwayne Johnson (never my favourite), actually plays well in a softer role and has good chemistry with Emily Blunt who is cleverly cast as an eccentric and determined British Doctor, and elevates the whole film from the charm portrayed in her role.Set in WWI era South American Jungle, jesse Plemons hams it up as a German baddie using every resource possible to find the magic tree before the others. Paul Giamatti also appears in a smaller role and gives a fun performance as he often does.It is all very sanitised and clean for a younger audience, but how can you not have fun with a movie like this? Who doesn't want to be adventuring through the jungle looking for treasures! Therefore, lots of fun to be had, although I would say it is a little overlong in it's runtime causing some lessening in interest in the final third.Overall a fun movie that all ages can enjoy and I am not surprised they are planning a sequel.7/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

My first encounter was as a wide-eyed 11 year old who realized even then this was terrible cornball kitch, but I found it an enjoyable ride as part of the whole Disney suspension of disbelief experience. Scroll forward a whole lotta years and a bemused middle aged me seeing virtually the same ride. Mildly amusing (but truthfully the other lines were too long). This set my expectations pretty low, but I'm pre-disposed to like any movie with Dwayne Johnson. Going into it, it started to look like a somewhat amusing spin on Tomb Raiders with a ready made McGuffin with a real monacle wearing Tuetonic villan to boot. Jumping forward a bit. The Rock is really quite good with deadpan humor. Feed him some really old jokes and he carries them off well. Airplane it's not, but it sets the tone at just the right level, and never takes itself too seriously. The acting on all parts was superb. Each character including the villians came off true to form and I didn't sense a missed note. Half way in I was feeling 11 years old again waiting for the next surprise.

Since it was made to promote the ""Jungle Cruise"" attraction at WDW and it was DISNEY, I expected a lot of entertainment along the lines of PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN. I really admire DWAYN JOHNSON, be he is no Jack Sparrow. The ""special effects"" were Disney-like fantastic... but WAY TOO MUCH for one movie. I was exhausted after watching it, and now - several days later - am having a hard time remembering what the plot was all about. In summation, it was a bad rip-off of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, complete with Germans trying to get to the ""treasure"" ahead of the British expedition.IF... you want to see a really GOOD ""Jungle Cruise"" movie, then pull up the 1951 Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn in THE AFRICAN QUEEN. Both were nominated for Best Actor, as well as John Huston for Best Director. Bogart won the Academy Award. That's where the Jungle Cruise attraction idea came from in the first place. You can sit back and enjoy this movie - you won't have to sit on the edge of your seat for 2 hours.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

No. Asking? OK, asking 'why doesn't this ride have a movie?' After all ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" was successful and popular at some point and even know ""the Haunted Mansion"" was a complete bust we could see something better in the future, so why not ""Jungle Cruise""? It couldn't be hard to come up with a movie about an adventure on a jungle cruise could it? To no shock from any one ,the answer is no it's not. The biggest shock I experienced with the movie was just how fun the cheese can be. This stars Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt as the films main heroes, this should have already been a sign of how unshocked I should have been. They are such likable people and have an incredible ability to turn the worst idea into a fun passable time. They also share some fantastic chemistry that makes their characters really click. It also stars Paul Giamatti and Jesse Plemons as the villains and that right there is enough for me. Both chew their scenery with their branded forms of acting, although Giamatti is not nearly in it enough, Plemons shows up sporadically as an over the top nazi who's more cartoon parody then human and its funny as hell. But its Jack Whitehall who steals the show as the stuffy brother forced along on the adventure. Usually this character can appear as an annoying trope, the Mummy franchise comes to mind, but here he is very endearing and an entertaining character, one who's story can be seen as grating to those who hate ""Woke"" culture being forced into everything, but here it works and it feels natural. These characters are all a blast to watch from one silly and ridiculous set piece to the next. It's unfortunate though that they are forced into some very dark and blurry CGI with another set of villains ripped right from The Pirate franchise. These characters add a twist and some interesting backstory, but come extremely rushed and muddled in night time gloom of the CGI Jungle. These scenes can completely take you out of the quick wit and fast pace plotting that serve the absurdity of it all. Still, it's a good entertaining ride.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

If you liked any of them and chances are you probably did then this film will seem familiar.Dwane Johnson plays Dwane Johnson in exactly the way he does it in every film he makes. He's basically a modern John Wayne. He plays himself in every film he is in.Blunt works well in the film and thankfully this does not turn into the modern version of an action film where the female is the hero and the bloke an inept fool. She and Johnson work well together although I'm not sure their is that magic that suggests romance really.Jack Whitehall plays the comic relief sidekick to Blunt in the way that Denholm Elliot played the inept help to Indiana Jones in Raiders.Effects are very good and don't overwhelm the actors and actresses unlike some films. There's tonnes of it but mostly used to portray the scenery.Overall an enjoyable and watchable family film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

If you throw The Mummy, Pirates of the Caribbean, African Queen, and Raiders of the Lost Ark into a pot with a current Disney spin - you'll find this film. There's certainly drawbacks to that in the form that it recycles many effective parts and pushes a bit of current politics, yet collectively the charm can not be denied.The film succeeds in reinvigorating the spirit of the classical adventure genre, with some creative twists that I did not expect. It does however falter by certain underdeveloped plot points and the overreliance in established tropes and character archetypes. I certainly wish Disney would be more courageous in backing more creative scripts, however I cannot truly fault this film for being a safe yet great time. That's really what it is. It's fairly derivative of a variety of classics, but the stars are charismatic, it's occasionally quite creative, and there's plenty of fun to be found here.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It would be easy to point out how it's a kind of 'cut and paste' rip-off of another of Disney's theme park rides, 'Pirates of the Caribbean,' and then blended with 1999's 'The Mummy.' It would be equally easy to write off the characters like Emily Blunt being little more than a stereotypical 'strong woman' while Jack Whitehall plays her inept younger brother. However, for all the film's faults, the two aforementioned actors, combined with the lead - Dwayne Johnson - they actually make it watchable.Like 'The Mummy' it's about a female scientist (and her coward of a brother) acquiring the services of a local man in a dangerous location (now the Amazon) during World War 1 and getting him to escort them to track down a magical item. Meanwhile, various villains are on their tail - who are generally just 'evil dudes' so don't expect too much nuance from them (even the excellent Jesse Plemons) and Paul Giamatti's contribution is little more than an extended cameo, so don't expect too much from him.Although it's based on a theme park ride, I found the similarities with 'The Mummy' more apparent, but that's just personal taste. The characters could come off as annoying (and very nearly do so!), but are saved by the actors reeling in their own performances just in the nick of time.Perhaps the main 'problem' I had with 'Jungle Cruise' is one that many a modern movie suffers from (in my opinion!) and that's its runtime. It just goes on too long. I could forgive the blatant green-screen filming and cheap-looking computer generated effects if they shaved about twenty minutes from the overall length. It kind of dipped in the middle and the 'effects heavy' action scenes also went on too long.It won't become a franchise like either the 'Pirates' or the 'Mummy' films, because - sadly - it's just too generic to really attain the same status as either of those. It's not a terrible movie and, as I say, that's down to the cast. I'm sure it will keep their die-hard fans entertained and possibly and children who are actually okay with sitting still for longer periods of time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I felt the chemistry between Blunt and Johnson through the screen, which was surprising since they don't seem like each others type IRL.

I don't think the serious scenes are his strong suit and I suspect there's a sassy Spaniard out there somewhere who would have fit that role better. But I do love DJ in general, so it's not like it totally ruined the movie for me. The plot and the flow of the movie was a little scatterbrained at times and I kind of checked out here and there, but overall, I thought it was fun.

Tried to squeeze too many 'Disney Ride' concepts into the film, I guess. The Rock was BORN to play that role, but the CGI and weirdo effects and creatures detracted from his work.We saw it as the first feature of a drive-in double-feature, and, to be honest, if it had been the second one, we would have departed as soon as the plot became entangled with haunted legends and creatures. An old drive-in movie screen hardly does credit to the favourable special effects anyway--see it at a Dolby theatre, or wait until you can see it on your own HI-DEF screen at your home theatre.This, I guess, is the challenge Movie Companies face these days: lure folks to the Big Screen to be dazzled. Yes, but serving 12 dishes at dinnertime will not necessarily enhance a restaurant patron's meal either.Had I been on the Production crew, I would have shortened the film and simplified the tale5/10.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A fun adventure movie with a messy plot","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7286882/?ref_=tt_urv","MovieWarfare","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112855274/?ref_=tt_urv","29 August 2021","Jungle Cruise (2021) is another attempt at making a movie franchise based on one of their rides at their theme parks. The only real success so far has been Pirates of the Caribbean. Most of the time it is Tomorrowland (2015) or The Haunted Mansion (2003). The premise is ""Dr Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) enlists the aid of wisecracking skipper Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson) to take her down the Amazon in his ramshackle boat. Together, they search for an ancient tree that holds the power to heal -- a discovery that will change the future of medicine"". So is this more close to Pirates of the Caribbean or Tomorrowland?Firstly, Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt truly carry this film. Dwayne's scoundrel and charismatic performance surprisingly works well with Emily's posh and outgoing performance. Both have great chemistry together and when they are both bantering with one another, it is enjoyable to watch. The majority of the movie is about the characters on the boat which is what the ride is about. So I do appreciate the fact that they did attempt to keep it faithful to the ride it was inspired by.Jungle Cruise feels like a 90s movie but that is not quite a bad thing in this case. It is advertised as a fun family adventure movie and I do believe it succeeds in that aspect. There are some silly but fun jokes that mostly land and there are over the top action sequences that are fun to watch. We get the 90s comic relief guy and even over the top villains as well. For the most part, it does feel old fashioned but it works and I can definitely see families enjoying Jungle Cruise. There are also some really nice twists and revelations that genuinely surprised me as well.However, the plot is a bit messy in its execution. For example, it takes quite a while for the Jungle Cruise to actually start and even when it has finally started, there is a lot of downtimes that don't advance the plot. The film's length is over 2 hours and it feels way too long. The movie could have easily cut 15-20 minutes of runtime and made it a better film, pacing wise. Dwayne's character, Frank Wolff, is the cliche cynical and shrewd character who is initially unlikeable but gets better later. Jungle Cruise takes almost over halfway in the movie before he actually becomes likeable which was way too long in my opinion. Jungle Cruise also has a villain problem as there are two villains in this film. Aguirre, the cursed Spanish conquistador, who wanted the tree's power to save his daughter but is now immortal and Prince Joachim who is some german guy. Both are chasing the protagonist but Prince Joachim himself feels like a giant waste of screen time even though he appears more than Aguirre. You could cut Prince Joachim and the plot is still the same, that is how irrelevant his character is.Jungle Cruise (2021) has an abundant amount of CGI. It feels like CGI was the first solution to everything by the director and it shows. It wouldn't be as jarring if the CGI itself was good. Unfortunately, this is not the case as the CGI is very noticeable and not great by 2021 standards. The shots, editing and cinematography are also disappointing average and never feel like it tries to do more with it despite it being a big blockbuster. However, the music score by James Newton Howard has got to be the most disappointing aspect of Jungle Cruise. James has done scores for many great films such as King Kong (2005), Unbreakable (2000), Fantastic Beast franchise etc. For some reason, James gives a very weak score for Jungle Cruise (2021). There is no soundtrack here that sticks in my mind and it has no iconic theme like Pirates of the Caribbean.Overall, Jungle Cruise is a fun action and adventure film that is reminiscent of classic 90s films such as The Mummy (1999) but never as good. Thanks to the chemistry of Dwayne and Emily, the Jungle Cruise manages to stay afloat to keep you engaged but it certainly ends up being a very generic and forgettable movie. Nevertheless, it is better than a lot of Disney's previous outings that were based on theme park rides. Not as good as Pirates of the Caribbean but better than Tomorrowland which is a huge step forward.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The story is good, but the scriptwriters IMHO tried to cram a little too much into the first hour so that part does seem rushed. As others have mentioned, there are two sets of villains, one set begin as comic relief then turn really nasty, the other set begin as heartless, yet ultimately become almost tragic. There is also a sub plot in the middle which is not satisfactorily resolved, and the ending, intended as romantic, is slightly macabre.There are some interesting SFX, and plenty of jokes to lighten the mood, without which the story would turn into a Rider Haggard novel without the necessary pathos. And the acting is fine, with good performances all round. Go and see it, and have a good time without taking it too seriously.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

All the best elements from the very best adventure films, all combined into one.

Also Supernatural homage to the Pirates of the Caribbean films baddies and they are being pursued by Germans, led by a very likeable character, that pleasantly had ZERO Nazi references. The always efficient Paul Giamatti added as a great supporting addition, to a superb cast. People will dissect and try to find fault, but I really can't identify any.

You clearly can see the influences from films as The Mummy (1999), Indiana Jones and The Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and The Pirates of the Carribean: Dead man's chest (2006).The script that was used for the final project takes the blame for most of the shortfalls of the film and its cohesion. In addition we have poor character development which didn't give the audience any incentive for emotional investment in the characters.The villain of the movie was not really that interesting or unique enough to create a memorable character. This has been a staple of Disney Films of creating memorable stand out Villains.The film has slow scenes that makes me feel they just added scenes just simply extend the screen time to just over 2 hours. I rather pay for a good quality 1.5 hour film than waste my time and watch a mediocre 2 hour film.Disney has a history of putting out quality product, but this film I feel was far from hitting that mark.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The CGI was impressive and the animals were believable and just check out the leopard on how well that was done.

Chemistry between DJ & Emily was pretty much perfect minus the overuse of the word ""lady"". The film had me reminiscing other films such as POTC & The Mummy. However, the film lagged at times causing it to feel a slight bit too long. Overall, enjoyable- would recommend watching, especially in theatres.(My Ratings)
Overall: 90/100
IMDb: 9/10
Letterboxd: 4.5/5The Review....
If you were to ask my family & friends if I laugh a lot. They would more than likely say 'no'. However, this movie lightened me up to the point of not being able to contain my laughter. It didn't take long for the jokes to start, and though they were ""dad jokes"", I very much enjoyed them.Chemistry between DJ & Emily was surprisingly great. I wasn't sure how to feel about the pairing at first, but they worked well off one another. The only thing I didn't care for was that DJ went from calling his female co-stars in ""Fast and Furious"" 'woman' to 'lady'. It got old quick, but it still works out in the end.It was truly hard to not reminisce about other movies in ""Jungle Cruise"". The constant ""hey lady"" had me remembering ""The Mummy"" with Brandon Fraser, the Conquistadors reminded me of ""POTC"", and the water draining had my sister remembering the second ""National Treasure"" movie. Although this film pulled from other films, I'm sure, it still had somewhat of an original feel.This is part enjoyable and part gripe. I could be wrong, but most if not all the film felt like it was done in front of blue or green screen, and so the lack of ""sets"" didn't give it a true adventure feel, however, the animation wasn't terrible and at parts it was believable depending on the scene.Lastly, the only other real gripe was that pace was good for about 95% of the film. That last 5% kind of lags after a good laugh, or a high action scene, thus making the film feel a bit too long. Again, it was still an enjoyable watch.","14 out of 32 found this helpful.

At an hour and a half in we were checking to see how much was left- and shocked to see how much was left. This movie could have benefited from a good haircut trimming it down. We were all really confused about the storyline. The consensus at the end was- that was weird. We've watched Journey to the Mysterious Island, Pirates of the Caribbean, Jumanji I&II all many times. This movie really lacked the magic. Not sure where the hype reviews came from. Did they watch the same movie? Also not sure who this is geared towards. Too long and scary for younger kids.

Here's some real advice for the people who "" hate everything the rock or Emily blunt is in"" stop watching their movies as you'll keep hating them, then there's the angle it's pushing women as badasses , it works she's great, both can be badasses it really doesn't matter! It's fiction!The other thing, yeah there are great adventure films but who only wants to watch 2/3 classic films ever because they're great? Comparing every new movie to established classics then always making them come up short. Such strange logic, how can you ever enjoy movies if your comparing everything to something already 10/10. This film easily measured up IMO and is this absolutely classThis film is exactly what you want, fun story, great action, funny and makes you forget the stresses of the world for two hours, in my opinion it's a joy and works perfectly.

A few forced jokes thrown in for the children, but they almost have a negative impact for adults. Again, it's all, okay. Nothing special.Definitely not one to spend too much money on.

However this movie goes a step further and fails my expectations of any fun or action whatsoever. The first 10 minutes fly by so abrupt you have to try to focus, in an ACTION MOVIE, on what is happening story-wise. The cast of the movie have very wooden acting, even Emily Blunt, who was a great actor in other movies this year such as A Quiet Place Part II. The movie's plot is incredibly basic and after the hyper-fast first few minutes that it's not very hard to follow. I bet you could fall asleep for a while half of the movie and you would miss nothing because of how many plot points there are that contribute nothing at all. The four extra antagonists besides the main one just might not exist at all, as they serve only as jump scares (which by the way, I'm tired of seeing, Hollywood). The movie's visuals could not be any more bland, the movie is just wood and stone, and nothing else, and it hurts my eyes to look at because of how bored the film feels. The movie is unfunny because the majority of the humor is bad jokes, which the studio prays the audience will find ironically funny, which they ended up not finding funny because comedy does not rely on the irony of it being bad humor and therefore funny. There is a plot twist I shall no say, but it does come out of completely nowhere as an excuse for later events to work out, which gave me the impression the film was being made up as it went along. The one good thing about the movie is one action scene involving the main antagonist killing a handful of scientists in ways unexpectedly brutal for a Disney film. This is only, however, a brief moment of violent bliss before sinking back until a movie that is definition of mediocre. The main set pieces of the movie, you would expect, would probably be breathtaking or cool to look at, but all that it is is just unfortunately bored looking locations. The majority of the fight scenes are basic and obviously not hard to replicate, comprising of punching, punching, and I almost forgot to mention, punching. The film is so trope-filler I could predict every step the characters would take next, and watch them unravel unfortunately accurately. This is an awful movie I would never want to see again. It's not the worst, but if you wish to see it, make sure you buy popcorn, so at least you have a bribe to keep watching.","11 out of 31 found this helpful.

So we now get movies set in the past with strong, smart, feisty females taking on the world and upsetting the status quo. Men back then seem to be mostly bad/weak/misogynistic/chauvinistic etc. Which, to be fair, doesn't seem far from the truth at times. This is fine, as long as the point isn't laboured too much during a movie that it becomes tedious. Emily Blunt does very well in Jungle Cruise, blazing a trail for feminism by wearing trousers and taking on the stuffy male establishment as well as the numerous bad guys. I initially thought that Jack Whitehall was going to remain as the wimpy brother to balance things out (as he couldn't possibly upstage a woman now could he??) but he actually shows some backbone and redeems himself. Anyway, the film is a mix of humour, action, adventure and silliness in the style of Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean. Throw in some dodgy CGI animals and Dwayne Johnson telling some seriously bad jokes, and you have a watchable piece of fun with some exciting moments and a few good laughs. Just don't take it too seriously and you'll be fine.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film does look pretty ambitious so it makes the film so enjoyable, but sometimes it does feels too overstuffed. Now the story in this I'm not a fan of it and the character performance I didn't liked it but sometimes it can be funny. Also the villain they could've give us a better character arc. Now that is just something that I didn't liked in this film.Now if if you love action movies you should watch this movie.

The language, they decide to speak Spanish in several parts and the Spanish in The Rock is really bad, many unintelligible and mispronounced words.5. Animals.

Maybe because it was conceived as a clone, and not as something original.

However his character of being a jerk and a scam artist is nothing more than upsetting. That's just the 1st and 2nd act. Emily Blunt's character is adventurous, mostly feminists, and she's afraid of swimming.The great deal of this movie was their chemistry and hilarious moments together.The weakest part of the movie was the villain and their quest to find a mystical tree that heals and gives life.This German Commander is a mystery. He has no motives or is not a likable character. The only character is the cursed captain who is trapped by the Jungle's curse.The movie had some great moments.

As a ride adapted ride, the story is not really that great. Some of the CGI is a bit off. And there can be some instances that don't really make sense. But for what it is, it can still be pretty fun with some enjoyable action. The characters can get interesting, especially when we learn from the skipper's backstory. And there's some effort put to the visuals and background. The one thing I can say is this is a popcorn film. So I'm gonna recommend this. This is one of those movies that's actually based on a Disney ride. So this could be worth a watch if that interests you. I won't consider this the next blockbuster and it's franchise worthy like Pirates, but it was a decent watch.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The tree is located somewhere in the Amazon. Lily steals an arrowhead artifact from a museum, which is believed to hold the map to finding the tree.She embarks on a journey to the Amazon to find the tree, along with her comic relief brother MacGregor (Jack Whitehall). They hire Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson) to take them down the Amazon river. Frank has a few secrets of his own, and he, too, has been searching for the Tears of the Moon for a very long time.The film takes us on an action-packed adventure ride. In pursuit of them, is the film's antagonist and (another) comic relief character, Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons) - also in search of the tree. Around the halfway mark the film surprised me by becoming supernatural, but I like supernatural and certainly enjoyed that aspect of the movie. (I say 'surprised me' because I never watched a trailer beforehand and merely expected it to be a realistic treasure hunt movie in the vein of 'The Lost City'). The visual effects were good and 'Jungle Cruise' sure does look good on screen.So, if I enjoy supernatural, treasure hunt and adventure movies, why didn't I enjoy the movie as much as I thought I would? As mentioned in the beginning, the film felt like a theme park ride. The film was far too implausible with too many conveniences and coincidences. Whenever Lily fell off a cliff or was flung through the air there was ALWAYS a branch (or rock, or whatever) she could hold on to, and she always fell in the most perfect ways and was able to hold on with very little effort. (Yawn!). Also, she can't swim. Yet, when the situation arises where she simply must swim, she does it with incredible ease AND is able to hold her breath under water for a very, very long time. As someone who can't swim, I know this is impossible. These are just a few examples; the entire film is laden with these unbelievable 'saved by the bell' moments. They managed to overcome obstacles with incredible ease - as if it was a theme park ride...The film's constant slapstick humour voided the film of any possible suspense. Yes, I know this is a comedy, but cracking silly jokes when running for your life just seemed completely out of place. I didn't mind so much the humour during moments when it would have been perceived as funny, but the humour came at the most inappropriate times.Unfortunately, for most parts I found the film too silly and downright stupid to be entertained, and almost stopped watching several times. Oh, and that clichéd, predictable ending...yawn, is it over yet?","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's everything you'd expect from a big budget summer movie, very light-hearted and fun with a lot of set pieces and non stop action. But, and this is a very big but, it's also very derivative, borrowing a lot from other similar movies, as the plot is essentially the same as 1999's The Mummy and thematically it's very much like Pirates of the Caribbean (no surprise here). I always marvel at the amount of money Disney can put into their projects, so it's no surprise that they didn't want to take more risks than necessary to bring this movie into fruition, hence the safe screenplay. The acting is fine throughout, with Jesse Plemons being the highlight as the villainous Prince Joachim. I have to say that, in my opinion, Dwayne Johnson was horribly miscast unfortunately, and although he does a fine job with the material as he's always charming, and his very bad jokes are a highlight from both the movie and the ride it's based on, he seems a bit too big and too old for this particular part. I guess he's part of the no more risks than necessary but I would've gone with a totally different kind of actor. So, in the end, I think the positives far outweigh the negatives and although derivative and a bit forgetful I still had a great time watching this and can recommend the movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Jack Whitehall as McGregor is a comedic relief to watch and Jesse Plemons as Prince Joachim is okay.I didn't enjoyed the story of the movie that really, maybe because I have seen a lot of fantasy with with almost same storyline. There is a twist in this movie on who really is Dwayne Johnson's character Frank but that wasn't really enough atleast for me.As this is a fantasy movie, a lot of VFX is used and it is done in a good way, I really enjoyed the VFX of this movie. The background music of this movie could have been better. The runtime of the movie could have been shortened in editing. Talking about direction, the directorial aspect of the movie is okay. As this is a Disney's product and is targeted to kids and is rated PG-13, don't watch this movie with an expectation of seeing some violent action scenes. There are action scenes where characters get hurt and also die but are choreographed in a comedic way talking kids in mind.So, watch this movie if you have time and you are ready for one more Dwayne Johnson fantasy movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Weak story and a lot of things that don't make sense. The music was really awful at times...too loud, not fitting for the moment, or started playing way too early (for ex: giving away that the scary moment was going to turn happy while still in the middle of the scary). And some of the CGI at the end was SO bad!The good: Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson are charming as expected, and most of the acting is good throughout from the entire cast. There are a good amount of laughs, and plenty of adventur.There are enough good things to make this a fun one-time watch, and although there are many similarities to Pirates of the Caribbean, this is nowhere nearly as good.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Nearly everything onscreen, with the exception of the human talent, is clearly CGI, which continues to steal the thunder of most films produced in this manner, to my reality-loving eye.The story was much as expected: a bit of creative reimagining involving Disney's iconic Jungle Cruise ride and a magical Fern Valley-esque rainforest, a narrative which contained a modicum of sense at the outset but slipped into bewildering, sleep-inducing nonsense by the conclusion.Includes an obligatory nod to LGBTQ proponents that will likely fly over the heads of very young viewers.

That earned two stars. After that, the writers rely upon over-the-top slapstick action, to compensate for a lack of creativity and substance.Unfortunately, I suspect that corporate executives ordered up a mindless hyper-violent video game that should be adapted to film. While the story makes a positive effort at encouraging animal right, that is far outweighed by the objectification, patronizing caricature, and bloodlust, for death of indigenous peoples. Profitable media does not necessarily make good media.This production indicates that the studio has lost its soul in pursuit of profit -- which is the job of every good corporate executive. The real Jungle Cruise ride is not a roller coaster, which this production attempts to be. The ultimate feeling that this digital media barrage of special effects delivers is relief -- when it ends.Yet again, Dwayne Johnson carries the load of showing both compassion and empathy. That alone earned two additional stars. The experience of compassion and empathy is apparently unknown to the writers, who simply take a piecemeal approach of, ""wouldn't that be a cool scene?""","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

As the credits rolled, I struggled to look back and point at any particular moment that I enjoyed.The casting of Dwayne Johnson was a mistake. While he is arguably the biggest movie star on the planet, he just seemed out of place the entire time. He looked goofy wearing his skipper uniform, he lacked chemistry with the rest of the cast and I honestly would have rather seen a Hispanic (or Spanish) actor in the role.Unfortunately, this is not The Curse of the Black Pearl. If a sequel is made, I would like to see something more original. The cursed conquistadors were one-note, the brother's character arc was mildly interesting and the nickname ""Pants"" got old after half a dozen mentions.I enjoyed the initial staged ""Jungle Cruise"" puns and all, but my admiration of this film stops there.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

This is Indiana Jones meets Jewel of the Nile but with the Disney machine behind it, so you're in for some stunning special effects.I think I was smiling throughout the entire movie and let's face it.. based upon how I started this review you can already tell I'm not that kind of person. It's a miracle I even have friends ;)Nah, seriously: this movie is worth watching!Edit: was going to give this movie a 9, but Disney openly going for a gay main character? About time! Plus one! I must say: all the actors did a fine job, Blunt, Rock and certainly Jesse Plemons. Eversince he starred in Fargo I found this to be an excellent actor! His German's terrible though :D.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Generally, Disney live action films do nothing for me, with the recent exception of Cruella. Also, I'm not a big Dwayne Johnson fan and he wouldn't have been my first choice as the male lead, but he was quite good. All of the acting was good, particularly Emily Blunt.The story itself is nothing new, but the screenplay was clever and inventive. One of the ""bad"" jokes Frank tells his passengers seemed out of place as concentrated orange juice wasn't even invented until 30 years later, but it's a minor quibble. The romance between Frank and Lily could've been more convincing-it seemed a little manufactured. Jesse Plemons and Paul Giamatti were both hilarious.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Both Bogart's and Johnson's battered boats were held together with burnt tar and rusty nails and there was steam billowing out from every crevice.Johnson and Blunt fed off each other and the story line was great.

Lily travels from London, England to the Amazon jungle and enlists Frank's questionable services to guide her downriver on La Quila--his ramshackle-but-charming boat. Lily is determined to uncover an ancient tree with unparalleled healing abilities--possessing the power to change the future of medicine. Thrust on this epic quest together, the unlikely duo encounters innumerable dangers and supernatural forces, all lurking in the deceptive beauty of the lush rainforest. But as the secrets of the lost tree unfold, the stakes reach even higher for Lily and Frank and their fate--and mankind's--hangs in the balance.Bottom line is this film may have some issues with its dialog. It does. But the set pieces , musical score , over the top FX visuals , first rate action sequences and the star power of ""The Rock"" along side Emily Blunt trump any of the writings short comings. Disney has put together a fantastic period piece Summer Blockbuster with its Jungle Cruise chocked full of tasty adventure tropes (arcane curses, snakes, evil Germans). Indiana Jones meets Lara Croft with a little The African Queen thrown in for good measure ! That is a winning formula in my book.This film is just pure fantasy wonderful escapism entertainment! Isn't that what we go to the movies for? 8/10.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

At all. It's all her way (many times to her detriment) or nothing...granted the other characters were pretty cartoonish, but the way they wrote her was pretty sub par, primary among the issues is also that she's usually wrong.

Star Wars, Marvel, Pixar, the live action remakes of their previous films and other IP (Mickey Mouse etc.) generates tens of billions of dollars in revenue every year. They've already adapted several of their rides (Pirates of the Caribbean, Haunted Mansion) for the big screen, and Jungle Cruise is perhaps the start of another run of theatrical films based around their parks.While Jungle Cruise borrows heavily from the mysticism of the Pirates franchise (ships, cursed sailors, mysterious tribal villagers, magical McGuffins etc.) none of the characters are more than rough outlines from a first draft. Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt more or less play themselves, Jack Whitehall plays the ""eloquent homosexual"" stereotype with not much to do, Jesse Plemmons probably looks like he's having the most fun playing the bad guy but his portrayal of a WWI-era German prince isn't particularly menacing, even after killing a bunch of civilians in the opening act. The secondary villains never felt important to the plot in any way.The end result is a film that feels extremely derivative of every other adventure film made in the last 30 years. Our heroes avoid disaster, they meet strange people along the way, one of them gets captured, a couple of death fake-outs, you get the drill. Adventures are only thrilling if you care about the people in them, but there's no real character stakes to make you particularly care about whether they get to the McGuffin first or not (unless you count Emily Blunt breaking the glass ceiling or the Rock paying off his boat as stakes)There's some nice nods to the ride, some good costume design particularly during the jungle natives scene, and I suspect younger audiences will like it. It's not a completely horrible film, not even a bad film. Just a film that goes through the motions, goes through all the beats and hits them right on cue, but doesn't offer anything particularly exciting, interesting or memorable.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

If you liked either of those movie series, you'll probably like Jungle Cruise. However, despite some stunning visuals, the plot is long winded so it does get a bit tedious at times while you wait for things to really get going.The casting is OK, Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt work together well enough, Jack Whitehall is also serviceable as comic relief, but the characters do feel like copies of the characters from The Mummy. Jesse Plemons is a quirky villain, but lacking in menace. With all the other CGI villains, Plemons is pushed into the background for large portions of the movie.Overall, it's a decent adventure, it's just not as good as it's peers that it tries to imitate.

"8","/10","Very entertaining for adults","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8164020/?ref_=tt_urv","HotToastyRag","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23581966/?ref_=tt_urv","21 May 2022","My favorite ride in Disneyland is the Jungle Cruise, so it was a cinch that I would see the corresponding film. I had low expectations, since I knew The African Queen was the basis for the ride back in 1955. A modern movie just couldn't hold a candle, right? Well, yes; the story bears no resemblance to the 1951 classic, but it was very enjoyable all the same. In this unrelated film, Emily Blunt stars as an Indiana Jones/Lara Croft action explorer on a quest to find magical healing petals in the jungles of South America. She has a map and an artifact to guide her, and she brings her foppish brother, Jack Whitehall, along, for no other reason than so the audience can laugh at his incompetence. Chartering a run-down boat and a shady skipper, Dwayne Johnson, she soon discovers nothing is as it seems on the river. There are many twists and turns, no pun intended, that are exciting and unpredictable.As someone who has seen The African Queen more than thirty times, I was extremely happy to see all the little touches in the film that paid homage to the original inspiration of the Jungle Cruise ride. Johnson's striped shirt, hat, and kerchief nearly matched Humphrey Bogart's costume. Blunt's character name was Lily Houghton; Katharine Hepburn's character name was Rose, and her real-life middle name was Houghton. Little details like kicking the engine, tying a rag over the pipe after coming under German gunfire, describing the rapids as ""exhilarating"", and the close relationship between the heroine and her brother. I noticed them immediately, but it was even nicer to discover that Disney included them on purpose.I'm sure every modern adult in the audience loved this movie. There's an abundance of modern humor, including the ""bad"" jokes that the Disneyland ride guides tell to the folks on the boat. While no part of the dialogue really belongs in the 1916 setting, audience members who don't care about historical accuracy won't care. There are awkward pauses, sarcastic quips, and superfluous teasing, all of which belong to 2021's style of humor. On a minor note, the Disney corporation is on a recent crusade to be inclusive to everyone, and yet there was a stereotypical ""Stromboli mobster"" villain played by Paul Giamatti, as well as puns making fun of a cross-eyed woman. Just because another character says, ""That's not funny,"" in response to the jokes, doesn't mean children in the audience won't still laugh. It doesn't seem very inclusive to ridicule someone with cross-eyes, when clearly the audience is supposed to laugh at the jokes.Speaking of influencing children, there's a scene (that some would argue is unnecessary in length or at all) in which Whitehall confesses his homosexuality. Once again belonging to Disney's latest ""inclusive"" crusade, it really has no place in the story. To small children who wouldn't understand what Whitehall was talking about, it forces a discussion between them and their parents; I can only imagine the frustration of unsuspecting parents who thought Jungle Cruise would be a harmless movie to show their children. There's another lengthy scene filled with thinly-veiled sexual innuendo regarding the handling of a spear. The double entendre will undoubtedly make adult parents chuckle and feel slightly titillated, but the jokes have absolutely no place in a Disney children's movie. There are also three villains whose appearances are extremely gruesome: they are zombie-like ghosts who have been cursed to the jungle because their own quests to capture the magical petals failed. One is covered in a massive swarm of bees, and another has snakes surrounding him from head to toe. The fellow with the snakes is particularly frightening, because the snakes often swim around under his skin and contort his facial features. I'm in my thirties, and even I had nightmares after watching this movie.All in all, Jungle Cruise was very entertaining. I am an adult viewer, so I could keep up with the action, the fast-paced humor, and the connection to the original ride. But it's not for children. It's too scary, it's too sexual, and as much action that Disney tried to jampack into two hours, I can't help thinking little kids would be bored by historical legends and quests. Adults, you'll probably go see it twice.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. The very beginning has lots of swirling camera movements, and throughout the film there are a few swirls to keep a lookout for, and that will make you sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to gruesome characters and sexual innuendo, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The main villain too is just not evil enough, he is more camp than bad...I understand it's a Disney film aimed at a younger audience (yes I am 35 lol), but for such a big adventure film story it needed more!!CGI wise - some of it hits beautifully but on the whole the animal effects in particular just look bad!

There was no chemistry between The Rock and Emily Blount. This is just silly eye candy for kids. The ending was extremely bad. Far too sappy for my tastes. Too many loose ends left behind. This was sloppily written and poorly executed, even for a kids' movie! As is usual in movie trends these days, they bombard you with so much action and dialogue that you lose track of what's going on. That happened to me at several points. You've got people talking and doing things at the same time and you're scratching your head, trying to figure out what's going on!! This is something that needs to change about movies, this chaotic style that moves too fast for the attention span of people!!","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Starring such talented actors as Dwayne Johnson, Emily Blunt and Jack Whitehall, the film is inspired by the famous theme park ride and liberally incorporates details from it as well, like the boat captain's terrible puns and a reference to the ""back side of water."" It's a great family film!Set in 1916, Jungle Cruise opens in London, during a meeting of scientists. McGregor Houghton (Jack Whitehall) is presenting to the crowd as his sister, Dr. Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt), goes about her mission to collect a precious artifact from the archives. She ropes her brother, a rare gay character in the Disney universe, into the adventure she's been chasing since her childhood, determined to journey into the Amazon to an area called Lágrimas de Cristal and find a magical healing tree called the Tears of the Moon. Lily hates the rough-around-the-edges, scam artist Frank (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) as soon as she sees him, but she grudgingly agrees to employ him as their skipper down the Amazon, with the conniving German aristocrat Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons) nipping at their heels. Many adventures follow and the characters, as different as they may seem, grow close as a chosen family. There's also a pretty unusual supernatural backstory.As with any Disney film, the production quality of Jungle Cruise is incredibly high; each and every small detail in regards to the graphics and overall look of the film has been addressed thoroughly. This film's previously-mentioned punchy one-liners delivered by Dwayne Johnson allude to this film's origins in the theme park ride. The Rock undoubtedly, unquestionably puts on the best performance of the film, and his chemistry with Emily Blunt's character is what truly carries the film through some slow moments when the script seems to lose purpose. Viewers begin to forget the overall goal of the mission as plots and relationships mix. However, this problem only shows up in the last third of the film. Another major star in the film is Jack Whitehall. His character is especially significant given that it's one of the few instances where you can see an LGBTQ+ character on screen, and his struggles coming out in a rigid, heteronormative society are beautifully represented in a heart-to-heart with Frank. In summary, the cast and production quality take this film to a new level, while the script tends to bog it down.Jungle Cruise promotes teamwork, grit, the victory of good over evil, and, my favorite message, that no matter how different we are, there's always something we can unite over. We're always stronger together.I give Jungle Cruise 4.5 stars out of 5 and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. Jungle Cruise premieres on July 30, 2021, in US theaters and for a fee on Disney+.Reviewed by Eshaan M., KIDS FIRST!","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

So being clear I'm not a kid but these Disney movies are just amazing, and there isn't any rule that states that only children can only watch these movies, on the contrary these movies should be watched by everyone as it holds those basic human values that we, the new generation regularly ignores. .So, the story is basic, a regular hero and heroine, a jungle filled with magic, and some bad and cursed guys trying their best to stop these main leads to get an ancient magic that can cure any illness in the world and break their curse so that they can also live a good life.So, apart from the story, the movie is amazing. The thing that I liked about the movie was the character's acting. One of the best things about this movie was its cast. No one would have imagined The Rock in a Disney movie, but here we are, and I'm not disappointed. He did pretty good and Emily Blunt was amazing, as always. There's nothing I didn't like about this movie apart from the story.Acting was incredible, VFX were mind-blowing, and the direction was amazing. So, if someone would ask me if they should watch this movie or not, I'll say ""Yes, it's a good movie, wasn't expecting this amazing movie from Disney but it's a type of movie which isn't only for children. So, yeah, go watch it.""","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Emily Blunt is phenomenal. She gives 100% to the scenes and does everything right. You can't help but fall in love with her right from the start.Unfortunately, everything else falls apart. The story is simple, boring and doesn't make sense at some points. You keep expecting something exciting is going to happen but that moment never comes.CGI is all over the place. It doesn't feel natural and feels like overgrown kids make-believe fighting with dolls.Combining story and CGI, the movie can't decide what it wants to do. The movie stats with tones of color and music suited for a lovely children movie but than displays the most disgusting brutal scenes, for no obvious reason. I am asking, why?Actors are generally great, except Dwayne who doesn't like acting very much. Doesn't matter if it is a romantic scene, action moment or something funny, he always has the same exact face. Which gets boring very fast.Despite good acting, characters are 1 dimensional, some doesn't even have dimensions at all. I've seen zombies in movies that had more diversity and character than at least half of the characters in this movie. Which is a shame because I think that's a missed opportunity.The ending is the most typical and simple you can imagine which didn't bring me any joy or sadness or any emotion at all. It ends with an ""exhausting"" joke which did put a smile on my face because it defined the movie perfectly.Suggestion: Next time, invest 10% of the CGI budget to enlarge the writers room and actually bring life to at least some of the characters. With that, the movie could easily become 8 or 9, even 10 with the right polish.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I went into this cautiously optimistic and came out feeling underwhelmed and bored. Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt are fine. Their chemistry works sometimes and feels really awkward at others but their script doesn't help. The script leaves a lot to be desired along with the runtime leaves me feeling bored. I found myself checking my watch a lot during the second act because I just didn't care about the characters or what they were doing. The plot tends to take a backseat to explain the backstory of the villains and The Rock's characters but I don't really care about the villains or The Rock's character. There are two villains in this film and while one is completely forgettable the other is only held up by Jesse Plemon's engaging and energetic performance. His character sucks but he definitely helps keep me interested. The action started out fun but got bland and WAY too over reliant on CGI which at points looks really bad. The music felt really bland at points but they have a instrumental rendition of Metallica's Nothing Else Matters which was cool to hear. Towards the end of the film, Emily Blunt's character makes a really awful decision that contradicts what her character wanted and what The Rock's character wanted. As it deals with the end of the film, I won't spoil it but I was very annoyed by it. If you want a turn your brain off kind of movie then this would be perfect for you although don't expect a lot.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

As with my piece to "" Cruella"", I was in love with Jungle Cruise.Without giving any plot away, Dwayne pays a captain, ""sailing"" in the Amazon, and plays it off as a "" character"" to tourists. We get the Jungle Cruise that we all know and well, the corny one liners from the Park, the ""scared"" tourists, and yes, going ""behind"" the waterfall.Boat parks at the village, we meet Emily Blunt's character who, after much arm twisting , gets Dwayne to take her and her brother down the Amazon with this ""special"" necklace. Along the way, we meet Indians and a prince with a odd accent who want to derail their plans.There is plenty of adventure and suspense, enough funny one liners to put a smile on your face to think you are back on the attraction.

Another weekend, another option from that media conglomerate Disney! The latest adaptation of Disneyland ride into a big budget movie is Jungle Cruise, premiering in theaters and on Disney+ with Premier Access. Disney had great success with the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, which was maybe the first film adaptation of a theme park ride; and it was buoyed by spectacular effects including the daffy, virtuosic performance from Johnny Depp. Why not try again, right? In a sense, it would seem like a movie based on a theme park ride would need an over-the-top hook like a Depp performance to make it work, but Jungle Cruise has The Rock and Mary Poppins 2.0, so... Anyway, here's how Jungle Cruise fared in its waters.I've never been on the Jungle Cruise ride, so I have no idea if there is a storyline there. I'm going to assume there is not, so the screenwriters had to develop a plot to get the characters on an boat in the jungle and stuff happening. The basics of the plot are that Dr. Lily Houghton (Blunt), a brilliant and adventurous scientist ignored in the science community because she is a woman in the early 20th century, sets out to find an elusive tree with healing powers in the heart of the Amazon. Reluctantly accompanied by her younger brother, McGregor (Jack Whitehall), Lily determined with her wits and an ancient artifact believes she can locate the tree and survive the foray into the jungle. Lily and McGregor engage the services of a riverboat man, Frank (Johnson), who has secrets of his own, to get them deep into the jungle. All the while, mysterious strangers and nefarious villain lurk in the recesses of the jungle threatening to derail Lily's quest. Hijinks, puns, and CGI ensue.Look, the story is ridiculous, but it's a Disney movie. It reminds me of the quest to harness Vibranium from Blank Panther. Everything is so broad and vaguely sketched. The villains are evil for evil-sake - there's no definable motivation or characteristic, except that they are bad guys. It does take too long for the Lily, McGregor and Frank to get on the river and on with their quest. I can see a viewer getting a little bored about 20 minutes in. The movie does pick up when some cool special effects show up and inject some energy into the story. Once you get to that point, it should be smooth sailing to the end.On the positive side, Johnson and Blunt are a good big screen pair. They have good chemistry, even if the relationship is ridiculous. Blunt has that easy charm she carries in every role. She's believable as a plucky and headstrong scientist. It's easy to root for her. Johnson has charisma for days. Even though he is saddled with some groan-inducing one-liners and puns, he sells them the best he can and maintains his cool. I'll also shout out Jack Whitehall. He does a great job of keeping up with his superstar co-stars and even steals a scene or two. While I think the CGI is great, it overpowers anything from Edgar Ramirez and what's worse is that is steals from Pirates of the Caribbean without adding anything special. Nevertheless, the production design and magnificent set pieces are a great reason to see this movie.Jungle Cruise is a fun, summer Disney popcorn flick. It has issues with its plot and pacing early on, but it gains steam as it sails along. Blunt and Johnson do a great job of keeping the movie light and entertaining. Even though the story is ridiculous, you at least root for the characters and can get lost in the special effects, sets and costumes. I wouldn't run out to see Jungle Cruise, but a Saturday matinee with a bowl of popcorn, especially with the family, could be fun.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

All their film releases in recent history have been remakes, reboots, prequels, sequels or spin offs to already existing properties. I shed a tear every time I see what they are doing to the Marvel franchise.Anyway, I was a fan of the jungle cruise ride in my younger years and figured I would give this a go. When it comes to the story you get a pirates of the Caribbean vibe, all the way down to a curse. At times I found the movie forcing some ridiculous interaction or event simply to push the story along. The chemistry between the rock and blunt was good until it turned romantic I guess. The kiss and any events meant to indicate romantic feelings toward each other felt forced and awkward.Overall the movie felt like it was a forced adaptation from a company that continues to milk everything it owns right into the ground. As far as adventure / fantasy movies there are many out there much better than this. I would recommend a skip to this unless you are a die hard disney fan. Even then I think most over the age of 12 would find this movie boring and uninteresting. Some may enjoy it but for this guy, I say save your time.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

They gave the ride a true story. And found a way to develop a lot of the rides high points they the captains character (the rock). Emily blunt was great. Disney did a great job building a strong female character development without making it political. My buddy for and daughters loved it. Which made me happy she came off like a female Indiana Jones she high added to the cleverness of the movie.The cgi characters felt a little like reused pirates of Caribbean 2, but still charming.I was however a bit baffled by the inclusion of things that have been deemed politically incorrect that have been changed on the ride, but are ok for the movie. Not that I thought any of the movie was offensive. Just a curious noteThe only sad part is that the show leaves off with a possibility of sequels, but I doubt Blunt or Johnson have the commitment like Johnny Depp has for continued sequels. I hope I am wrong. And I liked that the rocks ego and big guy tone that is in every movie was downplayed in this movie. He seemed to fit the character more in this movie rather than all his other movies where the character is always built to be a pseudo Rock character.There is so much to like about this movie. But if you aren't hooked in the first few minutes, this movie is not for you. But if you live the jungle cruise ride at all, you will love this movie from the very few minutes.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

The addition of Jack Whitehall was a good choice and added a bit of charm instead of being the typical scared sidekick!Artistically it was beautiful to watch and the music throughout was a perfect pick! At one point the addition of a guitar has a Trans Siberian Orchestra feel and the music followed like TSO.Overall I think it's definitely one of Disney's greatest live action movies and I'll definitely see it again!","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

I have precisely zero memories of it though. Nevertheless, Disney have again transformed one of their rides into a movie, which is certainly no ""Haunted Mansion"" but it's no ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" either.Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) is an English explorer who believes firmly that, hidden in the Amazon basin, is the ""Tree of Life"", a rare plant whose leaves are an elixir for curing any ailment. Together with her brother MacGregor (Jack Whitehall) they head to South America and procure Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson) to transport them up the river. However, they are not the only people seeking the legend, Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons) wants to use the bloom to turn the Great War in Germany's favour and a long dead Conquistador, Aguirre (Edgar Ramirez) may not have ceased his search just yet.Ultimately, I thought it was satisfactory. I liked our three main characters and I enjoyed Jesse Plemons turn as the unstable German Prince. Paul Giamatti has a nice cameo as the owner of the port where Frank recruits his tour patrons from. The action scenes are generally decent, particularly as the film gets going and the gang leave the port. The CGI work I didn't find to be particularly good though, especially in the scenes at night and involving Aguirre's gang. It doesn't undermine the whole movie, but those blurry visuals are one of the things I can remember about it, writing the review 48 hours later.The problem for me was that it never quite kicked up that extra gear to get out of ""average"" and into ""good"". It's doesn't have that one aspect that elevates it beyond competent. As others have said, it's really similar to ""The Mummy"" in terms of both plot and character, but's not as good as that film.I'd probably give the characters another chance if Disney did make a sequel, but I can't see me rushing back to watch this any time soon.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

I know there's a covid thing going on right now. Just choose unpopular time slots. You won't be disappointed. The production value of this movie is really that good. It's an uplifting movie with great cinematography and well paced editing, so that it's really hard to pick up something bad. However I gave 8 out 10 because the plot wise, it's not really new. You'll feel the combined taste of Indiana Jones and The Pirates of Caribbean. The best thing about this movie for me is that the main PC characters are very well integrated into the story. Each character has just the right amount of the purpose, though we don't get to hear about Lily's life much - another deduction point. Maybe that's left for a sequel? Hope there's a sequel.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Watched all becoz of Dwayne Johnson I'm a big fan of him. I do like adventurous film; before I've watched journey, anaconda etc. This film is also that level what I mentioned. There has so many funny scenes with few breathtaking scenes ;while the boat 🛥 was so close to a pothole. That scene made me goosebumps. Throughout the film I didn't feel bore for a while. It glued me with my bed. On the talking of acting : Dwayne as Frank did a great job as he does in every film, Lily's original name is unknown to me however she nd his brother in film gave immense acting skills. Surely to say about culprits : they were all evil except the Prince did excellent play. My cudos to director who picturised such thought. There has far words to say about this film. Hence, I put all this things aside n suggest you if you a adventurous filmy buff, u can go n watch out. I enjoyed the whole movie n my belief u will do, too.I give my rate 8 /10.Thanks,

Neither struck me as being particularly engaged in their roles, unfortunately. About the only thing that I found interesting was the villain. Love that guy!Beyond that there is plenty more to find fault with, from editing mistakes, massive plot holes, improbable situations, and oddly some blatant cultural insensitivity because they're still the go-to bad guys?Then the constant yammering about a woman wearing pants? Oh please.The last act was both the best part and the worst of the film. For sure the most interesting, but also unbelievably frustrating because very little made any sense. We are supposed to just accept certain things even though they are not explained or in actuality just cannot be because they are logically preposterous even within the fantasy world being presented.","6 out of 18 found this helpful.

Cliche characters and predictable ending with a couple of twists here and there, along with some great humor and punchlines, wonderfully delivered by the Rock who does an excellent job as ""Frankie"" and a great case of Emily Blunt as the relentless semi-attractive explorer.Great acting all-around and great scenery capture (CGI = OK) will make this a fun viewing for everyone, on the flip side it's not as good as Inidiana Jones or the PoC, however if you need to choose one new family movie this summer, this should be on the top of your list.Exact score: 77 / 100.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

A Prime example of movie-logic plot. Only makes sense inside of a movie. Better enjoyable on a bigger screen. You might not need to go to the theatre if you want to stay safe. Huddle around with your family and enjoy.Very similar to 'Jumanji : Welcome to the jungle'. That makes this Nock-Nohnson's third Jungle outing.

Here she tries to research a mysterious tree that could cure all diseases. With the help of riverboat captain Frank Wolf (Dwayne Johnson), they can travel the Amazon rivers more easily. Lily must find the tree before others find it in order to use the tree and its possible gift for wrong purposes.Disney based the idea for this film on an attraction from their Disneyland theme park. So the writers of this film had little story to base the script on. This is reflected in the story of the film. To fill the two hours of playtime, they seem to mix up different storylines, which only complicates the film unnecessarily. Many of these storylines are also very similar to stories from other films, so that this film itself does not come across as original. If they had kept some storylines away and kept the movie so shorter, the movie would have been better.This movie is more fun for a younger audience or to watch with the family. But due to the long running time, children can lose interest in the film. Families can also watch other better movies together at home.Older viewers can see the visual effects that things were filmed in front of a green screen or that most of the animals were placed in the film using CGI. The CGI animals can be entertaining for younger viewers. Thanks to the green screen, it is also possible to visualize what people can see when they visit the attraction in Disney World.The acting is well done by most of the film's cast, but due to the size of the cast, not every actor has as much to do with his role. For example, there are too many villains in the film. What works best in the film is the mutual chemistry between Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson. Dwayne Johnson's character also makes a lot of bad puns. Many of these jokes can also be heard in the Jungle Cruise attraction.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The easy going nature of the plot makes for a happily ever after ending. The casting is put together well, and the plot could be seen as boring yet Disney did an effective job of countering that by giving the viewer more. More comical scenes- allowing The Rock to be The Rock. A plot twist towards the end of the film-who is this Frank Wolf? Which leads to a deeper meaning behind the story and the love aspect- unexpected.If you are looking to watch a fun easy going film with (typical Disney Live Action) and you have a full house ready to spend $30 on movie night then this is for you. It may be worth it for a good time and a long time... its 2 hours but felt so much longer than that.

No-one should go into this expecting Shakespeare. But while this will probably be a lot of fun for the kids, it's not quite as engaging for the adults in the audience. Characters are fairly thin, the CGI use is heavy and takes a lot of the weight out of the action. There are a lot of moments that would probably look amazing in IMAX or 3D but fall flat on a regular TV.Disney hit gold with the balance of spectacle and engaging characters in the Pirates series (especially the first), but in the years since they've had limited success repeating the feat with their other ride-based films. This movie doesn't change their streak, but if you have kids it's not a horrible way to keep them occupied for a few hours.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Guess what - it came to be an excellent movie, just like how the viewers were amused by the trailers and teasers. Throughout the whole film, the picturization/storyline and the VFX were tremendous but nothing extraordinary to remember repeatedly. It's just a great movie to watch with your family in this pandemic. The movie overall was spotless; however, the character of prince Joachim seemed pretty dull and witty. Overall it's a great adventure/fantasy movie in quite a while!!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The CGI villains are extremely well done and quite amazing. Emily Blunt is awesome in anything she does as well as ""The Rock"" Dwaine Johnson, follows the Disneyland ride ""somewhat "" in the beginning, then moves into a far more dynamic plot. Lots of action and fun throughout, keeps you on your seat. A few great twists and turns too. Glad to see movies more like this one. No politics or other ""agendas"" whatsoever, just family fun, no cussing or nudity whatsoever either. Great with popcorn and a soda. Sit back and be truly entertained for a couple hours.

The problem is that neither Dwayne Johnson nor Emily Blunt have managed to come up with as strong a performance as Johnny Depp did with Jack Sparrow. And no Geoffrey Rush on top of that.So all in all while its witty and full of well choreographed actions sequences and lavish FX, it just fall short of being exciting even bordering on uninteresting.I'm not sure that the current trend of signing up actors that have a tremendous bodies is really the way to go. Dwayne Johnson is certainly impressive physically but as far as acting is concerned can't say I saw a movie where I found him really good.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

We need more of these kinds of films because they are what most people are sorely missing these days; a check you troubles at the door adventure film that entertains for a few hours then goes away. It's a niche that superhero movies used to fill. Before they became agenda driven drivel that are less interested in entertaining and more interested in indoctrinating.Jungle Cruise is simply a fun ride (pun intended) for the entire family. Johnson and Blunt have great chemistry which I must admit surprised me at first. Johnson is his usual likable self=depreciating self who can be a badass when needed. And Blunt is perfect as the female adventurer with a mind of her own and a real talent for taunting Johnson's character. They play off of one another extremely well. I think that was the key to the movie being so good.Is this a deep and thought provoking film? Of course it isn't. And anyway, if you're looking to movies these days for deep and thought provoking messages you're in real trouble! This is a fun night-at-the-movies movie that will keep you interested and make you smile for a few hours...isn't that all that movies were ever supposed to do? Don't over analyze it, just watch it and enjoy the ride!","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

But this is really by-the-by, Jungle Cruise is an enormously enjoyable Disney adventure flick and its nice to see Disney portraying a character who is subtly hinted to be LGBT.Possibly down to the Worldwide Pandemic thus far Jungle Cruise hasnt perhaps been the smash-out-of-the-park blockbuster hit it might have been Pre-covid, but Disney is more often than not great at this type of flick and gets two thumbs up from me.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

With more interesting characters or a more consistent since of playfulness, the absurdity of the plot might be excusable.

The lore is alright and not much of a treasure hunt concerning the puzzles or creativity in the adventure. The CGI of the villains is awful.Overall: Unfortunately, the movie falls into Disney's cash grab of employing high-prolific actors and having high production in a sub-par story capitalizing on its IP's.

Remaking their classics(or having a spin off), sequels, and the like have been abundant in Disney, and other companies too.With the knowledge that Jungle Cruise is a Disney World ride like Pirates of the Caribbean, I went into this with both excitement and doubts. That said, Jungle Cruise was a worthy trip to the theater.The plot is headed by Emily Blunt(who was the titular character in Mary Poppins Returns) playing Lily, who is in search of a tree who's petals have the power to heal- making for a medical revolution. Along the way, she meets a jungle tour guide named Frank, played by Dwayne Johnson. After a deal, they work together to find the treasure.There is much to admire about Jungle Cruise, such as the cast. It also includes Paul Giamatti, and Disney Channel star Rapheal Alejandro had a couple of scenes. Even though I don't watch much of his work I must report that I perked up when he appeared.The cinematography is also well done, and very pleasing to look at. Some of it looked very real, even though some of it surely wasn't.Frank also tells many puns in the movie, most of which are in his first scene, in an attempt to amuse his tour guide attendants. To paraphrase one of them: ""I had a cross eyed girlfriend once. We could never see eye to eye."" As a lover of puns and corny jokes, they made me laugh hard.There are other funny bits as well, though this by definition is not a comedy. One line in the final scene made me and a friend crack up kind of obnoxiously and we quoted it a couple of times. I won't spoil that one, but Emily Blunt says it and it's a pun on profanity.Despite the joys Jungle Cruise offers, it did have it's criticisms. I mentioned the lack of orginality, though as someone who went to Disney World just once 13 years ago, that alone didn't bother me.While nothing really needed to be taken out, there were some moments that seemed to slow down the movie and sway my interest. I can't think of how I would change these moments, but I did feel antsy when this notion occurred.I did very much enjoy Jungle Cruise as a theatrical experience(Thanks to the pandemic, I haven't seen a movie on the Big Screen since Toy Story 4), but as for my recommendation for others, I would only suggest it for theatrical viewing or as a part of a Disney Plus subscription. I would not rush to buy it for a $20 DVD or $25 Blu-ray before doing either first. (I may own this but I am in no rush as of now.)That noted, with all things said and done, Jungle Cruise is a worthy watch despite it's shortcomings and is worth the ""ride"" either way.Note To Parents: While not too violent, please note the PG-13 rating before taking the really little ones to see this. It may be a little too intense in some areas.*If you enjoy this, please check out and (positively) vote on my other reviews by clicking on filmbuff-05706. I'd greatly appreciate it, dear reader! :)","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

To me the first half of the movie seem to replicate Indiana Jones movies. And then the second afternoon to pirates of the Caribbean. So that's all the creativity Disney has these days to copy other films? The movie was too long for my taste and the CGI was way overused and not that great. The worst part is that the producers trying really hard to create a romantic chemistry between the two main characters but it just did not happen. The kiss near the end was very cringe-worthy. You can tell it was awkward for both actors.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Knew it wouldn't get better, not wasting more time. Cast was fine. Direction was something else entirely.Long version:I grew up in love w pirates of the Caribbean and Swiss family Robinson and i loved both at the parks and loved the movies more as an adult. I have loved most of what Disney makes from the very beginning. Gave credit to movies i didn't personally like but saw the quality in them still. So i was surprised i actually couldn't stand this from the very beginning.The brief moments of funny were so heavy handed i couldn't enjoy it fully. The story is nothing I'm familiar with but that doesn't matter if the movie can't stand on its own. The whole thing was way too saccharin for us. Just everything about it. It was obviously made for kids, fine, per usual. But this is way over the top in some way. I can likely guess it's the Direction. Disney might be trying to form a new method. I've noticed this a few times over the years. This didn't time it didn't work for us.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The tale of the movie was taken from a number of other movies resulting in nothing new. Also the comedy was just endless dad jokes which were not funny. The characters were extremely stereotyped and very predictable portrayed with very ordinary acting.This was not really a kids movie having a major homosexual theme. This theme now seems to have to be included in all children's movies made in the USA regardless of relevance. This so called revelation had nothing to do with the movie but was included to tick a box to appease the minority.Overall a very disappointing movie and which I would not show to children due to the high level adult themes.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Jungle cruise has 2 of my favourite actors - Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt - who deliver smashing performances. Their on-screen chemistry is brilliant, and they display their individual passions clearly and credibly. There's a sweet love story here. The villain of the movie hearkens back to the moustache-twirling days of yore, with a ruthlessly driven mind played brilliantly by Jesse Plemons.The dialogue of the film is witty and entertaining, and remarkably sophisticated, tackling sensitive issues with taste and class. The special effects and settings are authentic and really well done. Set pieces are magnificent and breathtaking. You can almost feel the steamy heat of the Amazon in each scene. The supernatural aspect is a nice welcome twist, always. Just like the Pirates franchise, Disney really knows how to spin off classic theme park rides into excellent movies. The jungle cruise within cruise was a funny meta twist.There's a massive twist half way through the movie that absolutely nobody saw coming, which really changes the perspective on a major character. Bravo script writers. The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is epic in scale, reminiscent of earlier classic adventure films. This is an excellent must watch film.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The only thing that I noticed something off was the CGI, it seems like a lot of stuff needed to be, and should have, been retouched.

Character development lacks and falls into many places known as romance. The special effects are convincing but, the CGI not so much, the editing makes the film very tedious, ruining the experience, the characters do not feel with a thought of the time where the story takes place, the performances are not very remarkable, except for Emily Blunt, who makes the movie more enjoyable.It's a predictable, convenient movie, and it doesn't innovate with a different story.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

For years, movies have been inspired by witty scripts, intriguing novels or even great video games but this is the first time I know of that a film has been inspired by a riverboat amusement ride. While the idea might sound puzzling on paper, the final result is actually a decent adventure film for the entire family.Jungle Cruise manages to work for different reasons. First of all, the locations look absolutely astonishing. It's obvious that most of these locations have been produced in a studio but instead of looking fake, they transmit a magical atmosphere recalling fantasy milestones such as Avatar. The special effects in this film would even deserve an Academy Award.Up next, the story is simple but comes around with a few interesting twists and turns, involving the son of a German emperor, a mysterious indigenous tribe and a horde of undead conquistadores. These elements make the film entertaining from start to finish and provide a pace that will even keep viewers intrigued who have a short attention span.The acting performances are decent and quite sympathetic as well. Emily Blunt for instance shines as independent, resilient and strong woman who knows exactly what she wants and is willing to take enormous risks to make her ambitions come true. Her brother is played by Jack Whitehall who seems a little bit arrogant, naive and fearful at the beginning but who ends up becoming more complex and profound as he turns out to be courageous, loyal and supportive. Jesse Plemons finds an excellent balance between danger and satire when incarnating the son of a German emperor with megalomaniac eccentricities. Every single actress and actor does a very convincing job and manages to make a good movie great.Jungle Cruise is an interesting adventure film for the entire family. The movie is intense but not brutal. The story is creative but not too complex. The length is neither too short nor too long. It's the kind of movie that could equally please a grand-father who fondly remembers the Indiana Jones movies, a young mother who has grown up playing Tomb Raider video games and a young daughter who admires acting super star Dwayne Johnson. It might not be the most experimental, groundbreaking or intellectual movie but it offers two hours of welcome escapism to the whole family.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

* The characters look so stupid throughout the film, Like Lily Houghton(Emily Blunt) getting duped by Frank(Rock)
* The gimmicks pulled off by Frank are so lame that any sane person would see through them, but our Lily couldn't(Oi, someone tell her!)
* Though, it was supposed to be an adventure movie. It never gave that adrenaline rush or a thrill that you would generally get from watching such movies, e.g., Jumanji movies
* The lack of sense of thrill could be attributed to its generic and predictable screenplay
* It felt that Characters meet because the script demands them to do so, rather than creating a compelling scenario for them to meet
* It's like "", Yeah, we need a hero, a heroine and a sidekick for the adventure.""
* Generally, adventure movies have a wafer-thin plot. This film is no such exception to that
* To that, add lack of proper execution. I never really felt the motivation of the characters to undertake such a hazardous mission which is a classic case of faulty execution
* Jesse Plemons was a generic bad guy with a terrible and forced accent(dew it!), Jack Whitehall tried his best to make me laugh but all in vain
* The visuals were striking enough, though, not 200 million worth striking enough but striking enough nevertheless
* Emily Blunt is the star of the show, though her character was poorly written. She brought out her earnest self. Well, Rock is just himself in all movies
* There were scattered attempts at horror, but in the face of poor writing and clunky dialogue. It felt like a squandered opportunity
* The twist in the middle was a decent one and intriguing
* The ending was generic and predictable(Cmon, What did you expect?). I thought they would go the unexpected route, but no!* Overall, Jungle Cruise is partly entertaining but let down by poor writing and shoddy execution

This movie started out as the actual jungle cruise and very quickly turned to Bootstrap Bill and cursed gold coins and tribal indians turning Jack into a fruit kabob. Change the Caribbean to Brazil and switch the pet from a monkey to a jaguar and you've got yourself a brand new family adventure film. An adequately entertaining movie over all, but lacking the chemistry that Kierra Knightley and Orlando Bloom brought to the whole franchise. Disney's scraping the bottom of the barrel... what's next, rename Lightning McQueen and call it Autopia?","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Undoubtedly then their skills should have been sufficient for the task. However, the overall package failed to deliver. Jack was probably trying to play himself as well, but delivered an insipid and uninspiring performance in his role.The movie attempts to cobble together the best bits of Indiana Jones and Pirates of the Caribbean with a touch of The Mummy. This is somewhat like building one aircraft out of spare parts from several other brands and styles. The result just won't fly.In the final wash-up I found myself wandering away to find something more interesting to do.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

An out of his luck boat ride skipper is taking a woman bent on finding a mystical place in order to fulfill her father's dream.On a positive note to mention is the production value, the nice cinematography and a mostly capable direction. Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson also have nice chemistry.However, what's not working is for instance the story flow and how the arc is structured.The movie has almost progressed two thirds of its run time until the gist of everything comes to fruition to actually start off the meaningful plot. The villains are quite one-dimensional, even if one of them gets a half-baked backstory. And please for the love of god cast someone from the actual country if that character is supposed to be from there. Jesse Plemons is a capable actor but the German accent was as fake as imaginable. Same goes for Paul Giamatti.Another bothersome aspect are the character interactions that don't make sense or are only there for cliché points. For instance the comic relief brother is almost the exact same character as in the 1999 The Mummy. Moreover, there's tons of familiarities with primarily two movies, them being Pirates of the Caribbean and the aforementioned The Mummy. It would've served the story well to continue the story built up in the beginning instead of chipping in parts from other movies.Last but not least there's a surprise reveal in the movie that makes barely any sense considering the actions and behavior of that character before. It would've sufficed without and due to the many writing issues of that character the ending was unearned and barely believable.Summing up, this movie had potential but in the end it suffered from wanting to be something that used to be popular and in the meantime something on its own, as well making the end product a convoluted mess. However, it's alright for a Sunday afternoon.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

On the ride, a skipper takes a group of people through the jungle on a boat ride that is surrounded by wild animals and nasty natives. And all the time, the skipper tells bad jokes or puns-some are so bad they are good. And just because it's a Disney movie doesn't mean it is suitable for little kids, because it's not-it's rated 'PG-13'. There are some scenes that might frighten little ones, as well as some of the bigger ones, too-my wife was squeezing my arm on several occasions. Dwayne plays the skipper that is hired by Emily-a sort of Indiana Jane-to be a guide to take her down the river in pursuit of a magical flower that grows only in a certain area of the Amazon. Edgar plays a conquistador that failed in his quest 400 years earlier to find the flower and Jesse plays a Nazi trying to find the flower to help Germany win the war-this story takes place around 1917. The effects are good and the story has a nice twist near the end and if you are a Metallica fan-like me-you will hear a new version of 'Nothing Else Matters'.It's rated ""PG-13"" for adventure violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 7 minutes.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The Rock keeps the mood lively with his many jokes and puns. The production value such as the sets, CGI, wardrobe and the cinematography are top notch; exactly what I would expect from a Disney production. The Rock and Emily Blunt have good on screen chemistry. The pace of the film is fast with quick witty dialog lines and swashbuckling action scenes from both co-stars. The directing is superb. The entire flow of this film is as smooth as soft creamy sweet butter.However, as much as I liked this film, I couldn't help comparing and contrasting this modern day film aesthetics with the older classic ""The African Queen"" (1951) with Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart. It made me think how a remake of The African Queen might have look like today, without the Disneyfication in the script. I think the Rock could have pulled off Bogart's character.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The plot is wafer thin, and padded with so much pointless action it is exhausting. The use 7 cuts minimum to convey a simple scene, sometimes more than 20. It is horrid, like how Wes Anderson does his films now.The jokes do not land, at all. The writing is very poor and they can't make any of the material work. The pacing is rapid fire and the scenes that should be held on to are sped up.The visuals are the worst part of the entire piece, the background looks like poor quality CGI with the characters and foreground stuck on in the cheapest way possible; the same issue they had with 'The Witches'. The Colours and illumination never match up. Neither do the camera angles. Everything is nauseating and ugly. I haven't felt this nauseated since 'Cats' from 2019.Disney sank lower than last year's awful and disgraceful 'Mulan' movie remake. And that says a lot because I hated how that turned out, as did anyone with a functioning brain.Disney has absolutely no idea anymore how to make a movie, let alone write a script; they even lost the technical competency to produce or direct a movie any more. They seem to not know how to do the basic tasks to produce a sequence of scenes that don't look like a disjointed mess.2/10 the worst film I've seen this year, and one of the worst pieces of crap I have ever watched (I gave Mulan last year a 3/10 for much the same issues and they somehow made a worse film.)","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Traveling in time and exciting places, this story is set in 1916 where pants for women for still an issue and traveling to far and unknown places was part of some treasure hunt.Lily (portrayed by Emily Blunt) is the inspirational main character, driven by determination to solve the mystery about an ancient tree which holds the power of healing. She finds her challenge not only in the adventurous journey down the river but also in the fearless skipper Frank (Dwayne Johnson), and their witty rivalry becomes more and more intriguing and entertaining over time.Well set villain Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons) with his German accent and his submarine make the hunt through the Amazonas river even more fun to watch.

the funnies that the main characters delivered were amusing but not in a cringeworthy way.Late 19th Century setting into the early 20th century ,slightly anachronistic but for comedic effect
and of course all the social cliches of that period.Great scenarios for the Amazon delta and some improvised potted history of the early Spanish invaders of the Continent.Had a slight Pirates of the Caribbean flavour to it but not as frenetic.It seems that Emily Blunt ,Dwayne Johnson mixed with Jack Whitehorn's quick fire off the cuff style was a comedy marriage for the trio,
definitely a classic for this 21st century for revisiting.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Especially the dad jokes (which is what the boat driver on the ride does throughout the tour)!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It stars The Rock and Emily Blunt in another Disney production based on one of their many theme park rides, just like the above - mentioned Pirates of the Caribbean. And this in my opinion sums up the problems with this extremely expensive film. It is just way too, seen it all before, derivative.You want a wholesome, fun, family - friendly adventure with some non - threatening supernatural undertones and plenty of CGI imagery? This is it. In completely the same vein as it was in the above films and even earlier films such as the Indiana Jones quadrilogy. As such, it does feel like a cannibalised feature made up of spare parts from earlier, better quality products.So we have Dr Lily Houghton (Blunt) and her comically foppish brother (The Mummy) seeking a magical tree ( all of the above movies) and therefore requiring the knowledge, skills and abilities of experienced, Amazon River boat skipper Frank Wolff (The Rock) and his seen better days, river boat (The African Queen, Romancing the Stone and many others.). Inserted into the creaky, strung together, narrative are bad Germans (Indiana Jones), re - animated conquistadors (not pirates, as in POTC) and innumerable other jungle associated dangers.Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt have plenty of charm, if not a great deal of chemistry (The script never really allows it.). But much as I hate saying it about a $200 million dollar production, their star power wattage is no where near strong enough to overcome the crass, blatant phoniness of this project. Nothing at all seems realistic. It's just so obvious, so much of the movie was filmed in front of studio green screens and the content itself, is over - reliant on computer generated imagery.The pace is lightening quick, moving from one set action piece to another in the blink of an eye. But simultaneously uninvolving, because of the all too rapid - fire editing. The action scenes are cartoonish rather than exciting and largely a turn-off, because of a complete absence of suspense. There's a strong support cast, but talented actors such as Edgar Ramirez and Paul Giamatti are completely wasted in their under - written roles. It must be acknowledged that Jesse Plemons does have a lot of fun, overacting as the head villain of the piece.Jungle Cruise is glossy, escapist fare aimed it would seem at a tween audience and below. It could hardly be claimed to be adult entertainment, even at the best of times. As such, it is rather sad to say it's dull and inoffensive, rather than thrilling and riveting. I was frequently bored. I sincerely hope, no, pray, that this is the last of the Disney theme park ride films.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The poor directing can be illustrated by the fact that the out takes and deleted scenes are more entertaining than the movie. It should be a crime to take great stars like Dwayne Johnson, Emily Blunt and Paul Giamatti and make them drum down their acting ability and talent to fit a bad story.Johnson can deliver a well rounded and good performances in just about any project he takes on, so what is with the corny jokes? You tell me that this was funny? No! This was not FUNNY. Bad is an understatement. Get a good writer please!Blunt had better lines and scenes in the movie, but still the character was underdeveloped. There was a great deal of fact concerning the attitude of women in 1916 portrayed, but if you want to understand this better, I suggest you buy a good book and read the life story of Marie Curie. Do not waste your time watching movies that spin the facts and leave out all the important details.What really surprised me was how bad Paul Giamatti character was portrayed. When you look at the long list of his accomplished performances and what they presented in this film, you wonder what the director was going for here. If you want to see an outstanding example of Giamatti's s acting, watch his portrayal of King John in the movie Ironclad (2011). In the movie Morgan (2016) he plays Dr. Alan Shapiro in a short but powerful performance that works well with the plot and story. In Jungle Cruise his ability isn't allowed to develop the character, Nilo, at all. The character fails to convince and distracts more than supports the plot. His bird was more interesting then Nilo and they don't even mention the bird in the credits!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The problem is the pace of the movie. It start fast and does not let up, without building any reason for you to sign on to struggle/adventure. You don't have a chance to understand why it's all happening. There is no reason for you to care because they give no reason to care. It's all happening so fast you can't keep up and in the end you don't care. The classic 'raiders of lost ark' (as an example) had moments at the beginning of the film to give reason and mystique about it all and the non stop action later on was built up and had reason for me be interested as well as delivering tension and dare. Some 40 minutes in I am struggling to care cause the film makers did not take the time to make it important plus happening so fast I can't follow what the hell is going on. It is the most cheapest shot of action ever, blindly watching scene to scene with thrills and spills with dramatic music but no emotional investment at all. Bad, Bad, Bad! You might as well disjointed and related scenes of action fro a sketch show. Whoever are responsible for this film should never make a film again and hopefully for the sake of film lovers should be rounded up and shot. Sorry folks for the distasteful violence in last comment but watching them being shot .. no matter how painful to humanity, how horrid it is .. I guarantee it is more enjoyable than this film.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I wasn't expecting much from this film, given the source material -- an amusement park ride! -- but thought the sturdy cast could help elevate the material. Even excellent actors such as are on hand here can't help lazy and derivative material. The numerous sexual innuendos are a bit puzzling, especially in a scene between Johnson and Blunt's characters early in the film, apparently to appeal to adults woefully assigned with accompanying their children, but are really out of place and inappropriate. The CGI was expected, and despite such excellent studios as WETA and ILM behind it, was lackluster and unconvincing. Not even worth a view on TV; use the time for anything else.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I kept questioning ""How they did that?"" The only thing I found off was all the violence the characters got in that got repetitive, and some scenes were too predictable but again I understand that's why it's called an action movie.Overall I'd recommend, this movie was also over 2 hours long and I didn't even bother checking the time until the credits.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Sure, they spent some money on the latest ""actor"" to be en vogue, but -trust me- The Rock and Emily Blunt are 5 trillion miles from Bogart and Hepburn; they can barely keep this thing afloat.After having your eyes pummeled by ""great"" CGI (tell me how ""great"" it is in 5 years!), you get a rehashed ""plot"" leftover from Pirates of the Caribbean and that crappy Mummy remake in the 90s. Plus a lot of Indiana Jones tropes to really drive the point home.Sorry, but Disney is over. Yes, this will make its money back (mostly overseas), and maybe even warrant a sequel; but surely Walt is spinning in his grave!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Jungle Cruise kept capitalizing on the jokes and silliness of many of the adventure films that preceded it, and it slowly became goofy and somewhat irritating. While it did have a nice style that followed themes that we've seen, it became a bore fest with cgi and lighting that really started to hurt my eyes.I watched it on Disney Plus, so it might have been different for those who saw it in theaters.Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson are great actors in this film, and they had great chemistry. But they overshadowed many of the other characters, including the villains, who also felt silly and didn't provide any sort of intimidation that you'd like from a film like this one.All in all, a nice comedic watch that slowly becomes more tiring due to the material it keeps exaggerating and implementing, and feels more like a copy+paste of something you've already seen, rather than a homage with a creative spin.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That's the summary of this movie.In other words, you could say that this movie is just like The Mummy: A female English explorer with a fearful brother sets off to a distant land during the First World War to find a legendary, mystical place, guided by a rascal, who initially seems harsh, but in the end the two develop an affection for each other. But you could also describe the movie as a soulless CGI orgy where everything is fake and you feel like you're in an amusement park or in a video game. Basically, a movie like this could now pass as an animated movie. Only the actors are real - but not in all scenes either.Not even the simplest landscape shots in this movie are real. Everything is just green screen: from the tranquil village on the Amazon river, to the dolphins in the water or the pet jaguar. Not to mention the breakneck steamboat ride across the Amazon river that defies all laws of physics. Every Looney Tunes comic is more realistic than what Disney and Co. Present us in feature movies these days. I always ask myself: If kids grow up today and only know movies like these - how disappointed will they have to be when they visit such countries one day and then don't see any jaguars as nice pets, no indigenous people standing around on every corner in colorful feather costumes, who live in fancy tree houses in the jungle, and the boat trips are not like wild rollercoaster rides.How did our Spanish conquistador manage to develop a flawless American accent when he was surrounded by Spanish-speaking people along the Amazon river for 400 years? And why hasn't anyone noticed that he doesn't grow older and never dies? And who would take a submarine into the shallow reaches of the Amazon river? Speaking of river: The Amazon river is constantly changing its riverbed. A 400-year-old map would be completely useless today, because the river branches shown there would either no longer exist today or they would look completely different than they used to.By the way: Didn't Emily Blunt want to free all of humanity from illness and physical suffering by finding the flowers of this tree? Then in the end she gets her hands on one of them and uses it to bring Dwayne Johnson back to mortal life - without knowing at the time that another flower has bloomed. So she would have sacrificed the well-being of humanity for one person who was actually planning on finally dying anyway. Very clever Emily!And Dwayne Johnson looks ridiculous in a purple suit and top hat. However, he doesn't look any better with that ridiculous cap on.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Sounds familiar? You're not wrong. But while the Mummy could leverage this setup with good character development a strong antagonist with a believable motivation and just the right blend of suspense, action and humor, jungle cruse suffers from lazy writing, questionable casting decisions and barely concealed identity politics.First, you can clearly tell who is good and bad in this movie by their diversity score, which ruins at least one major twist as you see it coming from a mile away. And while Emily Blunts character isn't a full blown girlboss (she is allowed to make the occasional mistake) her smugness is hard to stomach at times. Dwayne Johnsons character is probably the most interesting here but is very much held back by The Rock's limited acting range. At least the action scenes do work mostly work and save Jungle Cruise from running aground completely but the whole movie feels very passionless and derivative.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It had some funny moments, big name actors, heck even a sufficient cliche plot that could have cut it. However, who ever put it all together must have been on acid or something! I really don't ever feel dizzy during movies, but man this one almost made me sick. Not only was the plot so incredibly quick that I didn't have time to think, the editing was so bouncy. It felt like the directs didn't want me to look at the cgi sets for longer than a few seconds because they thought I might find them fake. In the very last fight scene there was so much going on with the plot and the screen was jerking between shots so quickly I really couldn't follow along or, by any means, take it seriously.

When they make this kind of movies, they should also take children under 10 into account and avoid kissing and other similar scenes to the max, because that's the drawback of this movie. Acting, emotions and dialogue delivery wise Dwayne, Emily, Edgar & Jack have scored equally well, but highlight of the movie is its cinematography and visual effects, beautifully pictured. Dwayne should start focusing on other genres of the movies too, as it will add variety to his kitty.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It goes on way too long as well. The humor fell flat for us. It's sort of entertaining if you're scrapping the bottom of barrel for something to executed. Whoever made this movie didnt seem to put much into it and to expect the fact that they got Dwayne Johnson to star in it to make it sell. We couldn't even finish it it felt like such a waste of time. If you want to watch a movie like this, go watch the original Jumaji, Indiana Jones (there's tons of those), National Treasure, The Goonies, Zathura: A Space Adventure (if you're felling space-y). They'll give you a proper adventure/treasure-hunting fix.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

While some have been more successful than others (talk to Jack Sparrow), the Mouse House should get credit for trying new things in the wake of so many tired sequels that continue to be churned out like they're on a factory conveyor belt. That said, 'Jungle Cruise' feels more like a pool float in a swampy bayou.Yes, Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson are typically bankable leading actors. Yes, the plot is full of adventure, the dialogue is full of standard one-liners and the cinematography is full of beautiful (mostly CGI) rainforest scenery. Still, the final product comes off as inauthentic, contrived and dull. It's too long, too boring and resembles so many far superior films. It's more of a paper tiger than it is Captain Frank's pet jaguar.We all know that cruises have had a bad stretch recently.

Other than the points I've stated the whole plot was a good idea the visual effects were great and I would recommend the movie to anyone interested in the adventure/action genre. Overall I'd rate the movie 5.5/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Honestly, I was shocked by how much this felt like it should've been Pirates 8: Jungle Fever. I don't think the director had anything to with that franchise which leads me to think that the House of Mouse was really sticking their noses into this one and the director is just the one who got the credit.There's really not a ton to say about this one because it feels so much like going back over ground we've already tread pretty extensively. Yes, Johnson and Blunt are great and add their own charisma and talents to the screen, which is something, but that's not enough to make this feel like anything but a spin-off. It's funny at points, but each of those comes with this reminder that we're just splashing a new coat of paint on something we've seen before. If you're looking for a mindless romp that's fun but hollow, this will work. It's bright and colorful and you wont get bogged down with an overabundance of thought.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There is a really excellent performance by Emily Blunt.( Dr. Lily Houghton), that is straight out of Indiana Jones, and every scene she is in is worthwhile. The problems are her brother. MacGregor ( Jack White.hall). He is one pathetic character, and every scene he is in without Lily is aggravating ( especially his speech at the beginning). The other problem is the villains. Neither. Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons.) nor the Spanish conquistadors bring one iota of menace to the movie. They are so cartoon like they make Cruella De Vil look like Lady MacBeth. As for. Dwayne Johnson ( Frank Wolff), I have seen him much better then this film. Basically he is meh and outacted by the leopard. Basically 10 for Blunt, 10 for the leopard, zero for her brother and villains and 5 for Johnson. That adds up to an average of five which is why I give it 5/10 stars. Again a fair movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Boy was I wrong. This movie is the spiritual successor to Raiders of the lost Ark. Great plot twists and visuals all throughout the movie. The Rock did an Excellent job.

Good family fun I would recommend to anyone.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

My invalid wife was desperate to see this movie so I joined a streaming service to get it for her. Disappointed is too good a word for it. Factor in that the actors were paid millions to do it, fussed over on set and probably got a nice free holiday after the final shoot. They must see the film right? They must know how bad the film is? No probably took the money and ran. The only way to sell the film to the general public, one as bad as this anyway, is to hype it to the hilt. Brainwash me, my poor wife and all the rest who wanted to see a good action comedy to cheer up their lives a bit. To Emily Blunt and Wayne Johnston I say yes, you've starred in good movies in the past but sitting with your partners together at night, at home, you must shake your head whilst viewing this. This isn't acting, its stealing money from people who are desperate for a bit of cheer. I'm sorry to be so negative, I'm just annoyed.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Home to some of the most comedic Disney employees where they created a fun story line that made this ride fun. It was simple and pure. They literally made a gem out of a rock.After destroying two (to say the least) beloved franchises at the hands of Burton and Depp (wonka and wonderland) I was hesitant to ruin my childhood memories of a pointless story-less 15 minute ride at Disneyland. Luckily Disney has learned it lesson and they have nothing to do with project.So when I heard the Rock was taking on the Jungle cruise... I was not exactly thrilled! BUT, Dwayne Johnson successfully rebooted the Jumanji series when the entire world doubted him. He has made his way in the industry literally turning rocks into gems... (pun intended)I then thought to myself, Depp (whom I have much admiration for) would remind me that our favorite gonzo adventurer would always say, ""So we shall let the (viewer) answer this question for himself: who is the happier man, he who has braved the storm of life and lived or he who has stayed securely on shore and merely existed?""I heard the great Doctor himself say, ""Buy the ticket, take the ride.""This Gonzo Gem is an action packed, thrilling adventure through the Amazon that completely reimagined the boring 15 minute ride!And ""Wow, what a ride""","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

How ever the narrative is nothing special, and is Disney basically recycling some of their story elements from the past but changing it up a bit to make it some what more interesting. The plot is similar to Tangled with its premise of a specific plant having the ability to provide healing for all kinds of diseases or wounds, except this film is a treasure hunt race between the protagonists and antagonists similar to films like Atlantis: The lost empire.Villains: This film has two sets of villains, one being played by Jesse Plemons, and the other being a group that has a back story with Dwayne character. Jesse character, is one dimensional that has an unclear reason for trying to locate this plant in order to win a war, something that is only mentioned once through out the film and is never really explored further. The other group of villains were pretty great since they had a connection to the character of Dwayne and the Jungle, but didn't have a lot of screen time unfortunately.Supporting characters: The supporting characters to our protagonists is McGregor and a tiger, that although had some funny moments, didn't really have anything to add to the story besides just being there for comedic moments and has a plot device when the story couldn't carry on its own.Stakes: The stakes were pretty high with some close call moments, and knowing how important this plant is to the characters, specifically between Dwayne and the group which is revealed later, really helps create a strong ending.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
