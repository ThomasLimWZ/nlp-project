"7","/10","Familiar, but Entertaining","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5492452/?ref_=tt_urv","WooderIce64","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur84421527/?ref_=tt_urv","18 February 2020","After the success of the sleeper hit Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, it was only a matter of time before a sequel got made. Jumanji: The Next Level is pretty much Welcome to the Jungle all over again. It's a fun movie, it's cleverly written, and that's about it. It covers many of the same beats, but it's still funny because the premise is something that can be used for a whole new set of different jokes and gags. Spencer goes back to Jumanji, and the others need to get him back. Only this time, Spencer's grandfather (Danny DeVito) and his business partner (Danny Glover) get sucked in too. At the beginning, Danny DeVito is in the Rock's body, Danny Glover in Kevin Hart, Fridge in Jack Black, and Martha returns to Karen Gillan.The main source of humor is people adjusting to being in different bodies and having different abilities, and it is based on the idea of people ending up in the bodies of people drastically contrast with who they are as people. The reason it works is that the audience is somehow able to see Danny DeVito as the Rock, rather than the just Rock acting like an old guy. It's a difficult thing to pull off, and it does so successfully. While the idea of the old guys adjusting is funny at first, it does get old after a while. It funny enough on its own to make it a good time. Much like the previous movie, it carries a strong sense of adventure. It does end on a sequel hook, so Jumanji 4 is inevitable at this point. Based on this and WTTJ, we can imagine it's going to be a fun, entertaining, and enjoyable.","30 out of 32 found this helpful.

Given the above, it's time to wrap it up - «Jumanji: The Next Level» is a solid following of a 2017's movie. It's all about laughter, fun, amusement and adventures, of course.

In fact, it's sometimes even better. Basically, the flick is just fun. The crowd-pleasing body-swapping is amped up to eleven, shaking things up just enough so that they feel fresh. The main actors continue to properly impress in their chameleon-like roles, joined by a few extra treats that perform far better than you'd perhaps expect. Indeed, these new players are probably its biggest asset; a couple of them thoroughly perforate the entire experience despite only having a rather small amount of screen-time. The picture is often funny - though, never hilarious - and is oddly endearing, to boot. It isn't particularly deep or, even, memorable but it doesn't need to be. It's a good time at the movies; what more do you need? Obviously some better theming and, perhaps, a tad of nuance wouldn't go amiss, but it's just not that kind of film really and that's perfectly fine. Even if it doesn't impact you as much as some of the year's best, it'll certainly make you smile and keep you entertained for a couple of hours. Besides, its inciting incident is driven purely by character and it even manages to squeeze some genuine emotional connection, via a well-drawn dynamic between DeVito and Glover, into its otherwise otherworldly proceedings. Its acting is also deceptively simple but decidedly fantastic, fully immersing you in the idea that these major stars are actually four teenagers and two old men. Basically, it's not as simple as you might think. 7/10","279 out of 348 found this helpful.

If you liked that one you will like this. It is very much just more of the same. If it ain't broke, you know.A couple new faces, one of them I really liked seeing. Won't say who it was, but if you're older than 20, chances are good you like the person.The action is like last time, it's entertaining, but not mind blowing. The effects are overall good. The Rock has some, lets call them punching scenes, which I liked. Although the action direction overall, could have been slightly better, tighter.They once again have fun with the fact that the characters ""in game"" represent characters in the movies ""real life"". And I am pretty impressed with how the actors fared. Maybe especially Dwayne Johnson. (I think he's taking some serious acting classes, he's getting better) Overall the cast in this is very likeable.I didn't feel quite that much that I was in a video game, this time around though. Felt more like just an adventure, than an adventure videogame. They could have hammered home a little better.
So yeah, I was entertained, but it's pretty shallow and won't stick with me like, say, the origianl Jumanji. (I watched that as a kid, and it was kind of revolutionary, so of course it stuck) Nice family flick.","194 out of 242 found this helpful.

It's exactly what I hoped they'd add on because that's the kind of thing the first movie did, it tried to work with the stereotypes and elements found in those good old adventure games like Tomb Raider.I also liked that they brought back the WHOLE gang, the reason why movies like this where the most logical thing would be to make it anthologic, that is, with different kids experiencing the game; so when they try to use the same characters that supposedly learned something from their past experience in it, is a recipe for disaster because it's hard to bring all the gang together without it being forced. But i liked the way they did it, it felt controlled and fulfilling in the end.In conclusion, it was a funny, entertaining and creative action adventure movie, it's not gonna win any Oscars but it's so wrll thought of that it's a delight to watch and I feel it never grows old, you can rewatch it and enjoy it all over again","339 out of 425 found this helpful.

I could hear the audiences in the cinema laugh on the jokes and enjoy it as much as my boyfriend and I enjoyed it. Yeah, I have to admit there were some repeated patterns from the first one but along the way they also added several stuffs which brought fresh air to the whole movie.Also, I think the sequel conveyed deeper messages than the first one, potrayed by the characters problem in it, in which we can related to our real life. Lesson I got from this sequel: Sometimes you will hit the end but it doesn't mean it is over. It means, all you have to do is living the present and look it with different perspectives.From the plot of the story, it kinds of light and predictable, but hey, it is a decent sequel you can enjoy with your family. Side notes: They had after credits scene, it might hints about the potential third movie of Jumanji.","295 out of 385 found this helpful.

The remake a couple of years ago struck me as foolish before I saw it, but it turned into a highly amusing movie, with some favored performers. It made enough money that now it is a series. If they continue at this level, it will be a pleasant movie for me to see every couple of years.When we last saw Jumanji, it had been turned into a home video game, and the youngsters were vowing never to return. Well, by and large they do, because the last one turned into a surprise hit. They're a couple of years older, cracks have formed in their relationships, and for various reasons, two of them can't go in, because their avatars are taken by Danny Devito as Alex Wolff's grandfather, and Danny Glover as Devito's former business partner. They've been angry with each other for several years.It's a different adventure, and it makes as much sense as any video game. The avatars get swapped around, so the acting fun consists of watching the actors playing other actors in a FACE OFF sort of way. Dwayne Johnson does a pretty good Devito imitation, but Awkwafina does a better one.This is one movie that is not going to win any awards, but if you're not in the mood for deep-dish suffering nor for something biliously Christmas-like, this is a movie with good performers in roles and situations that will amuse you.","41 out of 50 found this helpful.

This was neither. I felt it was just as strong as the first. Expanding the old characters and adding new ones.
What impressed me though was Kevin Hart and Duane Johnson being able to do the cadence of old men. They showed much more acting depth than I expected from them.
All in all a very enjoyable sequel.","18 out of 22 found this helpful.

I don't know which I like better. The 2017 version is like the ""standard"" version of Jumanji introducing us to an amazing cast and filled with laughs. This movie builds on that concept and takes it further with a more diverse plot and new characters.
What I DID find dissapointing was that I felt that the fight with the villain was too short and over. But darn this movie was so FUNNY. I came out of the cinema with my stomach hurting because I laughed so much.","197 out of 259 found this helpful.

And frankly there isn't much more happening than the last time. However, it is the kind of treatment they went for this time.Karen Gillan gets a different character briefly and justifies it. Jack Black too gets a different character than before. But it is the new ""old"" characters which they added that works smoothly (with ""grease""). How they react and try to understand, takes up the majority of the runtime. That helps Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart to showcase and play with their characters. And all this is thought out so well that it is outright hilarious. Sure it was repetitive but writing and enactment is done so well that every time it landed into laughs. Everyone submerged into their respective characters very well.Action sequences were decent enough to keep you at the edge of your seat. The plot hadn't much but could have delved just a little deeper into two in-game characters than it did, which you'll know if and when you see.Other than that, it expands slightly more into the world building; you may or may not remember it later but you'll surely enjoy watching it. It definitely is a fun time at the theatre with your friends and/or family.However the nostalgia element that was till now missing in these reboot/sequel (s) is hinted at the end. So now I am curious to see how they handle the next obvious sequel, given how well they handled the new elements in this movie.","73 out of 103 found this helpful.

However, in my opinion, the best thing about the film was lovely Karen Gillan as Jumanji game avatar Ruby Roundhouse, a babelicious, kick-ass red-head in a skimpy outfit.The 'abs'-olutely gorgeous Gillan is back for the sequel and hotter than ever, making this a no-brainer for me, but the film itself is an otherwise fairly forgettable retread of the last one, with the same group of friends returning to the game where they attempt to save Jumanji (again) by retrieving another stone (from a barbarian and his horde). This time the gang is joined by two new players, Spencer's grandfather Eddie (Danny DeVito) and fellow OAP Milo (Danny Glover), which leads to not-very-funny gags (repeated ad nauseum) about the elderly characters struggling to understand their situation.The script could have been written by a ten-year-old, such is the level of invention and the sophistication of the humour. The action is, once again, visually impressive (especially in 3D) but heavily reliant on CGI, lacking a sense of realism with little in the way of genuine excitement or thrills to be had. At no point do we feel that the characters are in any real peril, especially given that each of them have three lives to waste, which we all know will be more than enough for them to complete the task at hand.Given how much I enjoyed the first film, I'm surprised at just how average The Next Level is. Another Jumanji adventure is undoubtedly on the cards, and as long as Gillan is there, so will I, but I seriously hope the makers pay more attention to the plot and the comedy next time around.","49 out of 77 found this helpful.

I expected it to be a tired retread of the original classic, but instead it turned into a highly entertaining action comedy. Reading my review again, I was rather po-faced about it and scored it with a rather measly 7/10. But this rather belies my secret love of the movie: it is a film that I can invariably watch and enjoy again and again.This was also a film that raked in a HUGE return at the box office, getting close to the billion dollar number on its $90 million budget. During the spring of 2018, this was an almost permanent resident at the multiplexes (until ""The Greatest Showman"" and ""Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again"" took over the residence for the rest of the year!) . A sequel was inevitableWe rejoin the cast some time after the events of the first film, and the geeky teenage lovers - Spencer and Bethany - are trying, unsuccessfully, to carry on their long distance relationship while at separate colleges. Spencer is struggling mentally; lacking in confidence and momentum and desperate to feel like 'Smoulder' Bravestone again.On returning to his home town for the holidays, Spencer fixes the shattered game. But the console is unpredictable and when the game sucks people into Jumanji this time it's not just Spencer and two of his friends that go in, but Spencer's Grandpa Eddie (Danny DeVito) and his old friend Milo (Danny Glover).When they get there though, things have changed and the mission is a different one. A ""next level"" indeed!This is very much 'much of the same' from the first film. Yes, there's a different backdrop with desert and mountain 'levels' to play through. But the same fun, with exploding avatars and dangerous cake, is to be had again. The script team had to do something different here, and they did that by mixing up the avatars (including a surprising equine player) and throwing in the 'pensioners' to the mix. There is new fun to be mined here from the now nimble-again Eddie and the slow-talking and laconic Milo never quite getting to the point in time.The stars were all persuaded back for another ride. The four avatar leads (Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Jack Black and Kevin Hart) all return, together with the young teens (Alex Wolff, Morgan Turner, Ser'Darius Blain and Madison Iseman). Nick Jonas and his older real-life player Colin Hanks are back. Even Nigel ""Welcome to Jumanji"" Billingsley (Rhys Darby) returns, this time swapping his jeep for a plane.The newcomers to the cast are also welcome. Glover and DeVito are at their cranky best, and introduce a genuinely touching moment into the film. And a new avatar - Ming Fleetfoot - is fabulous in the form of Awkwafina, so brilliant in this year's ""The Farewell"".There's not much more to say on this. If you liked the original, you'll enjoy this one too. Many of the same jokes are trotted out again. The villain (here Rory McCann) is as forgettable as in the first film. It's not breaking any records in terms of originality, but the producers won't mind about that as long as it drags the crowds in again. At the time of writing it has made $320K on its $125K budget, so that seems to be working.Jake Kasdan is again at the helm. But I really hope enough is enough, and they leave it at this. The mid-credits scene might suggest though that greed is going to dictate a Jumanji 4 (or 5 in some people's books). The returns, I fear, from the franchise will be ever diminishing from this point forwards.(For the full graphical review please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.)","18 out of 23 found this helpful.

My Dad, my brother and I thought it was a classic when we first saw it in the cinemas. When Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was released in 2017, I had serious concerns that this was going to flop at the box office. I was proved wrong as I had an amazing time in the cinema. A sequel was inevitable so now we have Jumanji: The Next Level which was fun from start to finish.The quartet from the previous movie return as Spencer (Alex Wolff), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain), Bethany (Madison Iseman), and Martha (Morgan Turner) reunite over the holidays after having gone their separate ways. While Spencer stays at his mother's house, he also has to live with his grandfather Eddie (Danny DeVito). Bored one night, he inadvertently reactivates the game console and once again finds himself sucked into the Jumanji game. Upon learning of Spencer's situation, his friends reluctantly re enter the world of Jumanji to rescue him, and take on the characters from the previous game. The four characters of the game are the muscular Dr. Smolder Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), Zoologist Franklin ""Mouse"" Finbar (Kevin Hart), Commando Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan), and Cartographer Dr. Shelly Oberon (Jack Black). This time, Spencer's Grandfather Eddie is Dr Bravestone and Eddie thinking he has died being in an unfamiliar world. Eddie's friend Milo (Danny Glover) has also found himself inadvertently sucked in also and finds himself in the role of Finbar. Bethany is overjoyed that she gets to play as Ruby Roundhouse, however Fridge is less than thrilled that he has taken on the role of Dr Oberon. Jumanji's guide Nigel (Rhys Darby) pops up to tell them about the new rules of Jumanji and what their main objective is. The quartet manage to find Spencer however he is now a female thief named Ming Fleetfoot (Awkwafina ). Left out of the game, Morgan enlists the help of Alex (Colin Hanks) who is now living a quiet life after being freed from the world of Jumanji having been imprisoned there for many years. Alex adopts his previous character Jefferson ""Seaplane"" McDonough (Nick Jonas) and Morgan is a horse named Cyclone who can only be understood by Finbar. The world of Jumanji is now taking place across the desert, the tropical jungle, and the snowcapped mountains. The team also find themselves against a new threat, this time an evil conqueror named Jurgen the Brutal (Rory McCann) who is also in possession of the Falcon Heart, a magical necklace which can end a massive drought that Jumanji is currently suffering under.Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan pick up where they left off from the previous movie and they still do an awesome job. Even with the changes in their alter egos they are still a crack up and had the audience in the cinema laughing.To sum up Jumanji: The Next Level in a word: fun. It's not the same as the first two sequels, but it's still fun. There was a few moments which stretched things a but thin, but I was having too much fun during the movie.I don't know if there will be a fourth movie, but never say never. I just hope the novelty doesn't wear thin.Sit back and enjoy the fun watching Jumanji: The Next Level. You won't be disappointed.7/10.","5 out of 5 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Not as good as the first one, but still pretty solid","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5318830/?ref_=tt_urv","austinbmoney","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur111066647/?ref_=tt_urv","13 December 2019","It is always hard to make a good sequel to a film that was already really good and defied most peoples expectations. Luckily, Jake Kasdan does just that with Jumanji: The Next Level. Just like the first film, this movie has tons of action and lots of laughs, as well as some great performances by the entire cast. It is not quite as good as the first film, as it retreads a lot of the same ideas, and not all of the jokes land, with some of them feeling quite unnecessary. Also, Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart having to act like they are old people does get a little stale after awhile. There are also just a few scenes/ideas in the film that really did not sit well with me, and could have easily been done differently. It sounds like I am just tearing apart the film, but those are really just some minor things that I would have rather seen done differently in the film, and they do not really greatly impact the overall product. In many ways, this film does things better than the first one did. All of the action sequences were very exciting, many of them were on a completely different level than the first film, both in terms of scale and excitement. Another thing that I loved was that these fully grown actors continued to convince me that they really were teenagers that were stuck in these grown up bodies, and that is something that is really hard to do convincingly. Overall, it was a very immersive film that manages to build a strong emotional connection with its characters, as well as improve and build off of many of the ideas that were presented in the first one. The ending also sets up a pretty interesting concept for a potential third film in the series that I would be really intrigued to see.","11 out of 14 found this helpful.

Also, Chekhov's Gun shall hencforth be referred to as Chekhov's Nunchucks.What? You need more than that? Fine....Jumanji : The Next Level is a direct sequel to the 2017 Jumanji : Welcome to the Jungle which was a soft reboot of the 1995 film Jumanji.Spencer, the lead from the previous film is having a hard time at college and finds himself back in the video game Jumanji. However things don't go as planned and his friends have to jump back into the game to rescue him. This time the game also sucks in Spencer's grandfather, played by Danny DeVito and his old business partner Danny Glover (in the best role he's had in well over a decade).This time however, the players don't get to choose thier characters and this creates an interesting fish-out-of-water situation that the film employs to it's absolute best use. Moreover, the dual roles pull some surprisingly good impressions from our main video game cast and showcases a range you might not expect from stars like Dwayne Johnson or Terry Crews.Jumanji has a tricky line to walk. Adventure/Comedy is a tough sell, yet Jumanji manages to craft a rollicking good adventure with action and peril, while never completely abandoning the humor. There are of course a fair amount of cheap shots and pratfalls,
the movie does feature Jack Black after all. However there's a lot of smart jokes, and humor that doesn't rely on the lowest common denominator. It's exactly the kind of comedy that I love and it never lets up.Throughout the film, there's a lot of heart, exploring interpersonal relationships against the backdrop of the adventure and ends with a genuine punch the air moment. The film is unfettered by politics and agendas and may actually be the most fun I've had at the movies this year.","133 out of 184 found this helpful.

After I saw it, I truly enjoyed the experience. It was funny, watchable for multiple viewings, entertaining, and creative. When they announced a sequel for it I didn't think it was necessary but was going to check it out regardless. The Next Level is not as good as its predecessor and has less laughs, however its a decent action adventure film that attempts to carry on a franchise.
The film takes place around the holidays where the group of kids from the first film get together. Spencer, goes back into the game of Jumanji after feeling unfulfilled and his friends join in. However, this time around Spencer's grandpa and his grandpas friend also enter. Also, this time around the game has changed. The stakes are higher and they have to play through a different level of Jumanji. The crew must band together and get into the right playable character to get themselves out of the dangers of the world of Jumanji.
The film is not as humorous as the first and feels like it has to tread similar ground, with things not being as fun the second time around. There are laughs though mostly through having the grandparent and friend personality shine through in the game. This film also explores different regions of Jumanji and is much more action and effects heavy. For what it is, its a fairly decent sequel though not as entertaining as the first. The addition of Awkwafina also helps the film.
Jake Kasdan tries to push his sequel and follow up the success of the first. It doesn't feel like its warranted but still makes for an entertaining time to close out a busy year in film. Some of it feels like it goes through the motions but for the most part the charm and work of the actors pushes the film to the finish line. I hope this is the end of it but I think the films success will definitely green light the next installment.

Jack Black and Kevin Hart are cringeworthy. Karen Gillan was ok.But the jokes and screenwriting are just horrible. Very few jokes actually work. The characters just stand around and tell horrible jokes every scene. There is no coherent plot.Possibly the worst part about the movie was The Rock. His performance was some of the worst acting I have ever seen. It's sad because The Rock can actually be a great actor (see his movie Faster). But this has to go down as some of the worst acting done by any huge star.The dialogue is so on the nose and expositional at times. The director and screenwriters should never be allowed to work again.Honestly what happened? Who green lit this? The sad part is that this movie will definitely break even or make some money at the box office. But the movie could make a lot more if it was actually decent.","42 out of 74 found this helpful.

It's the same as its immediate predecessor in two ways: firstly, the narratives are pretty much identical and, secondly, they're both fast-moving, fantastically entertaining and ferociously fun. Seriously, it's incredible that the last one worked, but the fact that this one is just as good is somehow even more surprising. While the MacGuffin driven plot is pretty generic, and the villain is extremely basic and unmemorable, it sort of gets away with it given its 'video-game nature' and, more importantly, the strength of its characters. It would be easy to dismiss the writing here and claim that its success comes from its spectacle, but that's just simply not the case. The film works because the characters are so well written and performed. They all have great chemistry, which creates the majority of the fun. This time around, the body-swapping concept is dialled-up a bit, too, which stops it from feeling like it's retreading old ground and allows the excellent actors to experiment even more. It's hard to believe that the 'real-world' actors barely have any scenes at all, which highlights how much the concept works. The big stars completely disappear and fully manage to channel their 'real life' counterparts; this just shows how good their performances are. The movie isn't deep, but it's not trying to be and sometimes that's great. It sets out to entertain its audience for two hours and it achieves that with ease. It's an effortlessly fun flick with a winning formula. I'm definitely looking forward to seeing where this series goes in its third outing (or is it the fourth? No, wait... the fifth?). 7/10","29 out of 44 found this helpful.

WHY?","25 out of 45 found this helpful.

Well anyone who has played video games before knows that there are usually multiple levels which essentially follow the same theme throughout. Hey guess what, the film is called 'the next level' and that is that is exactly what it is. So if you enjoyed the previous one, then it's a fair bet that you will enjoy this one as well.Yes there are some new characters here to add a little more to the story, but the format is essentially the same. Get into the game, solve a few riddles, get past some challenges, defeat some bad guys, and rescue something to achieve the goal and restore normality to Jumanji.The action and humour are just like before and the characters essentially do the same things as before but with a few little tweaks here and there. If you're going into this expecting a completely different film, then you'll be disappointed, but then you would also be a little naive to really expect anything different.Overall it's fun, with plenty of action and a similar vibe throughout to the previous movie. Myself and my family all thoroughly enjoyed it.","10 out of 11 found this helpful.

He enjoyed the first movie in the series, but this one falls flat in every aspect. To start off with, the plot is ridiculous and unbelievable. The reason why they all need to return to Jumanji is that one of the characters for some unknown reason went back and now they all have to go back to get him back. Wow, very creative and very engaging.
Then there's the terrible script-writing combined with awful performances that makes every attempt to comedy fall flat to the ground. Dwayne Johnson is not a particulary good actor and in this movie it indisputably shows.Save yourself the time.","13 out of 21 found this helpful.

It's a sequel, which means it's going to follow a similar formula as the first, switch up a few things and then amp everything up, which it does.Jack Black steals this one for me. He is hilarious and his turn as Fridge and then jumping back to Bethany highlights how sneaky good he is in this world. Karen Gillan was also a lot of fun. Visually it's on point, sounds good and is overall just a fun ride.On the flipside, the gimmick displayed in the trailer of the old men in the young bodies is definitely here and quickly becomes the most annoying part of the movie for me. A few jokes at the start would be fine but it just... keeps... going. I eyerolled multiple times watching this and that's not good.Balance those out and it ends up feeling like just an above average experience. There are moments of laugh out loud humor and fun action but they get counterbalanced by just ""ugh"" moments.Still, it's a fun experience and if you enjoyed the first one then thus is a no brainer and the reverse is also true.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

While the previous film used game avatars and the idea of becoming someone else as a novel take on teenage insecurity, this movie expands the same setup to include the grandparents and their reluctance to accept old age. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart are now playing two estranged old friends, with a large bone to pick. And oh boy, do they pull this odd couple act off!!! It is exactly this back-and-forth between characters that makes the scenes work. The action set-pieces are fun, but the screenplay shines when it slows down for the banter. Jumanji then feels like a movie, that is not made very often today. Action movies always have explosive scenes, but adventure movies have a heart. And that is where Jumanji hits home.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

How would the four characters we loved in Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle be drawn back into the game and 2.) would it be as good?As for question number one, it was a bit absurd, but Spencer (Alex Wolff) was so depressed and emotionally lost that he pined to be Dr. Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson) again. So, he repaired the busted game console in order to reenter it. The other characters, being his faithful friends, went in after him.As for question number two, it was just about as good. I liked the idea of introducing new people to be characters in the game. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart's characters were in fact two elderly men (Danny DeVito and Danny Glover). That small tweak made the movie fresh and funny. Kevin Hart and Jack Black stole the show, the two of them were hilarious.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

This is a direct sequel to Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle that takes place after the group from the previous film's first college semester. When one of them disappears into Jumanji for unknown reasons, it's up to the rest of the group as well as a few newcomers to find them and finish the game.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle made a ton of money at the box office when it came out, so a sequel was inevitably gonna come. Fortunately, it really delivers, but not quite on every front.At the movie's core, it's an action-adventure film that, just like its predecessor, combined video game tropes with it. It has scripted scenes, NPCs that can only say certain things as well as high-flying action. It's still self-aware and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's very funny and witty, as well as action-packed, which is what I was expecting. I don't go into Jumanji expecting some epic, serious adventure; just a fun, action-adventure experience, and I got that.There were some elements in this movie that really stood out for me for both the right and wrong reasons. One element that worked is that one of the main characters' struggles with returning to the group after college because he doesn't see his life as interesting. This was something I could relate to on a personal level, and I feel like many others could too. It works in the film's favor because it also gives him a satisfying character arc that pays off in the end.One element that didn't work was the addition of the new characters. There are two new characters that are added into the film portrayed by Danny Glover and Danny Devito, and while Glover's character is fine, I had a hard time liking Devito's. Don't get me wrong, when we meet him and he still is played by Devito, he can be pretty funny. When we see him in the Jumanji game as Dwayne Johnson, however, he can be pretty unbearable at times. He also has a grudge on Danny Glover's character and the reasoning for it didn't really justify his actions for me.With that being said, there are some areas where the movie rehashes elements from the second film. For example, the characters sometimes get themselves killed through stupid means. There is a person that goes missing in the game. Those are just a few examples of rehashed elements. They didn't hinder my enjoyment of the film, aside from during a few instances, but I thought they were too noticeable to not mention.Either way, despite my complaints, I had a very fun time with this movie. Fans of Welcome to the Jungle will most likely enjoy it. There isn't a dull moment in this film, and I found it fun despite its flaws. Pretty good movie!7/10","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

It infected the overall enjoyment besides some early and overused good jokes (old people doesn't understand video games and old people feel good in young bodies). Pile that with a worse rhythm, action set pieces, and video game story, and you get a really bad sequel.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

They obviously get sucked into the game again, but for a stupid reason - and this time, Eddie (DeVito), Milo (Glover) and Ming (Awkwafina) are along for the ride too.The concept is pretty much the same, with most of the comedy coming from the actors playing the ""real life"" versions of themselves, which is funny when it's The Rock acting like Dany DeVito. Kevin Hart talking really slow like Danny Glover is great to watch. Plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, as Eddie & Milo come to terms with the video game they're in. It's also good to have Nigel (Darby) and Alex (Hanks) back and Awkwafina is funny as usual, but doesn't get too much screen time.Some new settings, with the desert when they first enter the game and snowy mountains for the final act. It's obviously left open for another film, but it does fly by and seems like less than 2 hours. It's fun and easy to like, with not that many flaws, once you suspend believability. I think focusing on Martha & Spencer is OK and the story of Milo & Eddie is very nice. The Rock has less to do and the first half is mostly carried by Black and Gillan, which works for the film.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's still fun but it isn't as pleasant a surprise that the previous entry managed to be.Co-written & directed by Jake Kasdan, Jumanji: The Next Level introduces some new faces and embarks on the new adventure right away. Both Danny DeVito & Danny Glover are welcome additions to the franchise and the returning primary cast gets to play with several different personalities and it sure is more amusing than the action set pieces the film has in store.As before, not much is done to make the characters more compelling. The sense of danger is superficial. The route is predictable throughout. The big-budget set pieces are rendered in splendid detail but none of it enriches the journey by any means. Despite all the switching personalities at play, the entire cast follows the same routine as before and does a good enough job at it.Overall, Jumanji: The Next Level utilises the same ingredients that made the last film work and retains all its playful qualities to deliver an enjoyable, entertaining & sufficiently satisfying blockbuster extravaganza. Just like the previous film, it is a fun-filled popcorn delight that's flushed from memory as soon as it is over, and doesn't try to be anything more than a 2-hour long adventure-fantasy romp.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Naturally, I already had certain expectations before Next Level and to be honest while this movie didn't dazzle me as much as its predecessor, it had its big moments of fun and excitement.Trying to build up on what worked in the previous film, the creators added 2 new characters and a couple of interesting ""in-game"" mechanics. One thing they did well is capture the concept of old people not understanding video games and with that being said it was nice to watch Kevin Hart actually act and play someone else besides Kevin Hart. Rock on the other hand, was not up to the challenge despite packing a truck of charisma and energy which compensated for his acting skills.On paper, Next Level is only 4 minutes longer than Welcome to the Jungle, but because of its flow and occasionally butchered humor it ends up feeling like its half an hour too long. Still, there is nothing to dislike about this movie and the positives greatly outnumber the negatives so if you enjoyed the previous part, then I would recommend to catch this one too as its perfect for friends and family.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Bethany could have join the group from the beginning which would simplify the story and possibly shorten it a little. The Rock and Kevin Hart are both having fun but Awkwafina is probably the best old man. This movie is missing the fade from the real life characters and their avatars.

After I saw it, I truly enjoyed the experience. It was funny, watchable for multiple viewings, entertaining, and creative. When they announced a sequel for it I didn't think it was necessary but was going to check it out regardless. The Next Level is not as good as its predecessor and has less laughs, however its a decent action adventure film that attempts to carry on a franchise.The film takes place around the holidays where the group of kids from the first film get together. Spencer, goes back into the game of Jumanji after feeling unfulfilled and his friends join in. However, this time around Spencer's grandpa and his grandpas friend also enter. Also, this time around the game has changed. The stakes are higher and they have to play through a different level of Jumanji. The crew must band together and get into the right playable character to get themselves out of the dangers of the world of Jumanji.The film is not as humorous as the first and feels like it has to tread similar ground, with things not being as fun the second time around. There are laughs though mostly through having the grandparent and friend personality shine through in the game. This film also explores different regions of Jumanji and is much more action and effects heavy. For what it is, its a fairly decent sequel though not as entertaining as the first.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

And I'm not saying I hated it, but I really struggled to get into it.My main problem is the characters, I found a few of them to be far too jarring for my liking and just plain annoying. Milo in particular for a large part of the film was just frustrating to watch. It just didn't hit the same as the first. Also why the hell is Awkwafina now in absolutely everything. Becoming such a saturated actress already and it hasn't even been long.The humour I found to be a lot more forced than the 1st film, it didn't seem to flow as well and I sniggered a couple of times but that was really it.The plot itself I found ok enough, it was fun watch still and I did enjoy parts. The ending I found a little odd, I don't want to say anything that will ruin it, but there is one thing that I just found weird and really out of touch with the whole plot.The film came out 2 years after the first and you could tell. It had that feel of it being forced out, because they knew it would sell.What made the first so great was the humour and the overall enjoyment of the journey that the characters made. This instalment just lacked on them fronts this time.Listen, it's not a bad film. I know I've basically just slated it, but I did enjoy watching it. It just could have been so much better. I feel like if they took their time with it this could have been really really good. It is what it is I guess. This film is basically what I thought the first one would be, less than average humour with a bog standard plot. It's a 6/10 from me today! Expected better.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Our protagonists have to return to the world of Jumanji to retrieve one of their friends. However the game console is broken, and the game is even more dangerous.

However, there is an added level of unpredictability to the game, so even if you know they will eventually win the game, you can never know what will happen. Furthermore, the characters lose their lives earlier in the film, raising the stakes. The villain is also more menacing and a scene stealer too.

It had the chemistry, had the jokes, the acting and a whole new concept. And what happened then? Two years later another sequel popped up and it has become exactly what I was so afraid it would turn up to be - another cashgrabber. The next level shows no potential, no signs of any originality; old characters haven't changed one bit and in tryings to bring the tension and drama between them they forgot one simple truth - that the characters are supposed to be alive and easy to sympathize. Did I believe in Spencer's inner problems of self-identification? No chance. All the rest of the characters don't even have that. The new characters, played by two Dannys, DeVito and Glover, have like two minutes of screen time and then they continue their tenure in the videogame which is hardly a tenure to begin with, just some ""sucked out of the pinky"" issue that resolves itself as quickly as this movie came out. The jokes are still there but they're mostly connected with the new characters and their new avatars and I have to admit Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson are at their height here again which I can't say about the others. Overall the movie plays it safe and is therefore dull and, I repeat it once again, brings absolutely nothing new to the table. Did we really need a Jumanji franchise?!","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It is actually quite nice to have the characters return to the screen and having the actors and actresses there as well.Visually then ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" definitely is up to par with the previous movie, if not slightly better actually. Everything delivered by the CGI team looks splendid and very realistic. Which is a must for an adventure movie such as this.The movie is nicely carried by the likes of Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, Nick Jonas, Awkwafina, Danny DeVito and Danny Glover. There are also some nice appearances by the likes of Colin Hanks and Bebe Neuwirth.I can warmly recommend that you sit down to watch ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" regardless of doing so alone or with the family. This is an enjoyable and entertaining movie, with something for everyone to like and behold.I am rating ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" a six out of ten stars.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

The movie was fun, exciting, and adventurous but it felt like the 2 new characters, milo and eddie, took over the whole movie. I was looking for that generation talk between the grandpas and the kids. And since the console was a little broken, I was expecting for some glitches in the game like the avatars could've entered the real world in exchange for fridge, martha, milo & eddie. And bethany will be left behind to help the avatars go back to jumanji or something like that. Npcs like nigel could've entered the real world also to give the avatars their task on how to return to jumanji. It felt like they could've done a lot more things that would've made the movie a little more interesting than just the same game but with different level and additional characters. Maybe they will do a lot more on the next one.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I like the fact that they added new players to the game using the same avatars. Kevin Hart playing Danny Glover was hilarious only out done by Jack Black's moments as the Fridge.
The only new character is Awafina as a new aviator. She was good. Doing something that the Rock could not do as well. Definitely funny.
This movie has some good solid laughs that keep me entertained but the action adventure does not seem as good as the original. One or two action sequences stand out but they were ok in comparison to watching the character development in this film

However like many sequels to surprise hits, this film is not as good as the last one. Welcome to the Jungle was such a breath of fresh air, filled with great performances from our four leads, who return for this film. Hart is given so much more to do and is very entertaining to watch, Black is yet again phenomenal, while Gillan, Jonas, DeVito, and Glover are also amazing. The Rock shines, but he felt much more fleshed out in the previous film, while Akwafina felt underutilized. Altogether the film is a fun adventure that continues the story from the previous film, if not quite as engaging as the previous Jumanji films.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The good news is we have the same cast. However, for an unknown reason (lack of good ideas?), regional and ethnic accents are now supposed to invoke hilarity during body-swaps. To make matters worse, two characters are elderly. The ensuing age jokes wear thin rather quickly.This film is basically equivalent to an old, worn-out tire with some shiny new tread glued on (i.e., a ""retread""). It's an OK watch if you keep your expectations a bit low. I give it five (5) stars given I still like many of the characters.PS The ostrich running down the street at the end is a nod to the original film, where the Jungle came OUT of the (board) game, versus the (video) game sucking players IN.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The plot of that movie was very interesting, even though it was similar to the previous movie. The storyline was very well written and everything was well-explained, even though it was very simple and easy to understand. Gladly, the characters were exactly the same just like the previous movie! They were all very interesting, well-developed and really likeable. The casting was the same as before and their acting was really good. The filming location of the movie was exactly the same just like the previous movie, inside the video game. However, there were too many new locations that the video game took place. It was a very intense movie, action-filled and full of epic fight scenes. The opening scene (the introduction of the teenagers) was really good and very promising. The 2nd act was very adventurous and the 3rd act was probably the best part of the movie. There weren't any plot twists, however the ending part was really good and intense. Moreover, the post credits scene was definitely unpredictable and kinda shocking. The CGI effects of that movie were way better than the previous movie and it was very well edited. Overall, it was an enjoyable sequel, action-filled, kinda funny and I would definitely recommend it to my friends. Last but not least, we need a 3rd movie ASAP.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

What made the first installment such a success was the connection between the avatars and their real-life counterparts. Unfortunately, those connections were lost by swapping characters, minimizing screen-time and focusing too much on a couple of old guys.All complaints aside, this film still made me laugh and I am anxiously waiting for the third film.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

However, I don't think it's enough to base a movie around especially when it seems the movie is very very similar to the first film.The film has its fun moments, but there's ultimately nothing that special. It has simplistic themes that are just generic and feels like a needless adventure with the only difference being the characters are swapped into different bodies this time.

The movie/game isn't only the next level, but also a new edition, where like all other games it will be with new adventures, new skills, etc.
The acting leaves me convinced that they are the characters they are supposed to be, which I always find impressive in movies like this with identity-changes, or what to call it.

They found a pretty fantastic formula with the first movie, and they had actors that could embody characters that weren't natural to their physique (mostly), which exemplifies the caliber of actors they selected for these roles.In this movie, the premise is so touching that I hope it is based of a true story that is important to someone who wrote / produced it. Honestly, otherwise, it is the thing I would cut from this movie. It gets in the way, the entire movie. Sure there are some cute moments where the old guys are just happy to be capable again, but ""old people not understanding what a video game is"" is a boring, if not frustrating, trope, and combining it with ""stuck in a realistic video game"", and having to explain it multiple times really took me out of the movie, repeatedly.The ""character switching"" (I'm pretty sure that was in trailers somewhere) also feels like they were just cheating, so it didn't feel as fulfilling where in the first movie they exploited the existing rules to win.Also the new characters, and the random character assignments we're very strong. Having a character make a poor choice (especially as a moose-understanding) is funny and satisfying: arbitrarily random isn't random so it's just forcing the audience to deal with something. Thinking back on it, the new characters, while not vital to most of the game, are similar to the other characters in having specialized roles, they were just sort of lacking in the same amount of humor, due to previously listed reasons.Definitely watch this, just don't expect the same experience as the first movie.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is entertaining and funny throughout the movie.The movie can hardly go wrong with such strong casts such as Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Jack Black, etc. Their acting did not disappoint and their lines were good and well thought of. It has a predictable storyline which is not a surprise for this kind of movies so try not to think too hard and enjoy the movie.","7 out of 8 found this helpful.

The storyline was pretty much the same from the previous jumanji, with the exception of having Danny DeVito and Danny Glover being a very welcome party of the storyline. Both actors did a splendid job of making the movie even more funny to watch, I had a great time seeing them on screen. I also loved having Awkwafina as a part of this movie, and she needs to be in every other one from now on coz she was such a great addition . Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillian, Nick Jonas all did a great job as well.Guys, I am gonna be straight up with y'all. This movie is a lot of fun and had me and my friend laughing literally 80% of the time . And honestly, this kind of movie is really needed right now. Go in there to have a great time and forget all your problems for two hours. Highly recommend to watch this with friends or family this holiday Season.","7 out of 8 found this helpful.

This movie was a complete cash grab by the studio; thrown together quickly, and shoved out into the theaters in order to capitalize off the success of the first movie (which was average -at best).
I saw this with my 14 year old son because he enjoyed the first one. The ""jokes"" (if you can call them that) were incredibly lame, and the acting was was ridiculously bad (not in a ""so bad it's good"" way).
And of course, the end of the movie sets up yet another unoriginal, uninspired, and unapologetically bad sequel. The fact this movie has (to this date) generated $350 Million is both perplexing, and disturbing.","13 out of 27 found this helpful.

Fun sequel overall but despite a shorter adventure feel (switchblade was like one encounter) and predictable twists.Dwayne Johnson and Karen Gillian's chemistry is a treat to watch and both are very effective in the action scenes. Awkwafina is new to the cast and has done a good job. Nick Jonas appears late but leaves a mark. Rhys Darby, Rory McCann and the others get little scope but do a fine job.Overall Jumanji The Next Level is a great follow up to Welcome to the Jungle! It doesn't stand above the first from 2017, not better not worse. If you didn't like the first, highly doubt you'll enjoy this one any more. But it's still funny for those entertained by the first.Overall, it is a good fun movie to watch with your family.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Most of the cast from the last edition is there, but Danny Devito and Danny Glover, as well as Awkwafina are added to the roster, giving the film just the extra spice it needs from all three of them.Films like these have to be all about good fun. The script isn't going to blow anyone away, so it needs to lean on its performances, action and comedic timing. All three are good, with the comedy being the highlight. When watching a light action flick like this you expect to enjoy yourself, which I did, but it was a welcome surprise to discover just how funny it got. Forget the plot: main characters mimicking main characters in different game 'skins' just doesn't get old. In a way it just becomes more clever because all of these actors get to play around with each others roles.Keep your plot expectations tamed, grab some popcorn and prepare to have a few really good laughs. If you're up for that, don't hesitate to watch.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Following the unfortunate traditions of modern film industry, I expected a watered-down, less funny version of the first one. Thankfully, I was wrong.
The plot is rather simple and very easy to follow. It wraps up quite nicely, leaving the viewer satisfied and with all his questions answered. The jokes are still there; with great comedic timing and subtle inside gags, they are enough to make everyone laugh. The actors should be praised, and with improvements to the character(s) of the fantastic leading four, it's nice to see some new faces who contribute to the general atmosphere of the movie.
Overall quite enjoyable, left the cinema smiling. It's what you would expect from a movie as such, but in no way does it make you regret watching it. Would recommend if you're looking for a simple movie with many laughs (not ""we live in a society"", am i right?). Also, just might be the best comedy this year.","4 out of 4 found this helpful.

It feels like they set it up perfectly for this simple idea, and laid the groundwork for nearly infinite sequels that all feel unique, even though they are the same at their core. All you need is to have new people enter the game and inhabit the same characters, and we get to see how the actors handle new challenges. I was grateful to see that Jumanji: The Next Level at least attempted to deliver on that potential. The personalities do bounce around a little and we are introduced to a couple new players, Danny DeVito and Danny Glover. This was where the majority of the comedy was added to the film. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart have a lot of fun presenting themselves as old men, and I thought they did a reasonably good job with it. Also, the personal history between these characters brought the main storyline that worked in the film, because we need something more going on than just the video game in order to keep us emotionally invested.I think where The Next Level fell short of the brilliance that so many of us found in Welcome to the Jungle is in the fact that they felt the need to bring back the same kids from the first movie. No one has long-lasting affection for Spencer or Bethany (if they even remember their names,) and frankly their problems were mostly resolved by the end of that film. It made no sense to use them again, and the writers had to reverse some of the growth they showed originally in order to justify their return to the game. I could see carrying over one experienced player, so you could shortcut some of the exposition and avoid all the aspects of learning how to play that were involved in Welcome to the Jungle, but that's all we needed. Make it fresh and new, with lots of external conflict that needs to be resolved in order to get them to work as a team so they can defeat the game. It seems so obvious, and yet they failed to see it. That being said, I still had a good time watching The Next Level. They found a bit of the magic from the prior movie, and earned some hearty laughs. It pales in comparison to what came before, but I still appreciate that they had moderate success.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Anyway - it had a pretty slow start but was good once it got going. Dwayne Johnson was hilarious doing DeVito same within Kevin Hart doing Glover (Not enough screen time for Glover!)

Once again, Jumanji is ready to battle Star Wars at the holiday box office, but this time it seems the Mouse House will win. Luckily Mr. Johnson has his next film 'Jungle Cruise' lined up, which also takes place in the wilderness, and is made by Disney.Jumanji: The Next Level takes place a year after the events in 'Welcome to the Jungle'. Spencer (Alex Wolff) is an insecure loner at NYU, ignoring incoming calls from his long distance girlfriend Martha (Morgan Turner), who's seemingly having a great time on her own. Bethany (Madison Iseman) is on her way back home for Christmas, after taking a gap year on the other side of the world, while Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain) has been spending most of his time at the gym. Spencer is surprised to find out he'll be sharing a room with his grandfather Eddie (Danny DeVito) - who recently had hip surgery - and realises life didn't turn out the way he wanted after high school. While trying to fix the game, he gets sucked back in and it's up to his friends to once again save him from the different challenges in Jumanji.Co-writer and director Jake Kasdan (Bad Teacher) is back to helm his sequel to the box office juggernaut. But while he tries to refresh the story, by introducing new ways the avatars in the game are able to interact and change, he also forgot to make it interesting and to not just repeat exactly what he did in the previous film. The film drags when there's no action on screen, and is just not as funny, since there's nothing new to begin with. The three big action sequences, involving mostly animals, are exciting and riveting, but the overuse of CGI looks too fake when you are dealing with life-like avatars in a game.Not just the director and writers are back, but also the entire cast, with some new and welcome additions. What has been a wonderful year for Awkwafina, after her success with small film 'The Farewell', is getting even better when proving she's the best part of this blockbuster. The hysterical cat-burglar Ming is just the type of character that felt fresh and though-through. Another new character in the game is a horse, and even that one has more surprises than good old Dwayne Johnson (Fast & Furious: Hobbs and Shaw). He's unfortunately the weakest link in the film, with nothing more than just changing up his mannerisms and voice, there's not much else that changes him from every other part he's ever played before.Karen Gillan (Avengers: Endgame) and Jack Black (The House With A Clock In Its Walls) are comical and get the most screen time. Both are pleasant to look at and get the best lines, especially when their characters aren't exactly what they seem from the previous film. Comedy legend Danny DeVito (Dumbo) plays newcomer Grandpa Eddie and is typically DeVito, which diehard fans will thoroughly enjoy.Jumanji: The Next Level isn't just repetitive and never ending, it's just not as crisp as the beautiful white snow our characters walk on. Besides a few laugh-out-loud jokes and the inevitable by-drums-preceding heavy action packed sequences, this sequel feels lazy and not worthy of its predecessors which both tried and succeeded changing up the adventure-genre. An overlong third chapter in the Jumanji-franchise that Grandpa Eddie would label as just... meh.Originally published on intoscreens","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Although the storyline is far-fetched, I must admit, I really enjoyed this film. The fact that Jack Black, The Rock and Kevin Hart weren't acting the same as they have done in most of there films, made it interesting and the CGI was top form, especially during the Emu and Monkey scenes. The storyline was also written well, and the chemistry between all of the characters, especially the Rock and Kevin Hart, was great. It's harmless fun for the whole family, with decent action scenes, and enough tension to keep you glued to the screen. The various twists and turns throughout the film, made the two hours seem like an hour, and I liked the fact that each character got the same amount of screen time, including the new characters, Eddie (Danny DeVito) and Milo (Danny Glover). Ming (Awkwafina) was also a brilliant addition to the cast, alongside Jurgen the Brutal (Rory McCann), who is well known for playing the Hound in the Game of Thrones. Don't get me wrong, it's not a cinematic masterpiece, like the original Jumanji which was released in 1995, but for a sequel, the director managed to produce something fresh and unique with the same characters. It's not often I can say that I would watch a movie again, but I honestly think that I would give this a second watch, especially as a lot of movies got held back this year. Enjoyable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Jake Kasdan, who also brought you Zero Effect in 1998, Orange County, The TV Set, Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story, Bad Teacher, Sex Tape and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. With the first movie making $962million, it was in the studio's interest to bring these characters back to the big screen, even though Dwayne Johnson's wages must have doubled. This film had one of the fastest turnarounds from filming to theatrical release for a major studio film, with filming beginning in February 2019 and wrapped four months later in May. It was then released in December, seven months later, which was extremely quick compared to most films which are released one year after filming. After seeing Dwayne Johnson's schedule, it's not surprising that they had to get this film wrapped fast. With 14 films in development and due to be released, including Red Notice starring Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot, Jungle Cruise with Emily Blunt, Black Adam, which is a spin-off from Shazam, Big Trouble in Little China and San Andreas 2, he's definitely in demand. Although this movie didn't make as much money as the original, I hope to see these characters again because it has the makings of a decent franchise.Budget: $125million

Main problem with this film is that there are no sense of escalation (next level), with each set piece almost instantly collapsing into a busy spectacle of eluding stampeding animals, running across rope bridges and taking on waves of enemies. There are few hilarious scenes paired with a good dose of adventure, but this predictable film fairly succeeds in recreating the magic from the 'Welcome to the Jungle'. It's just a shame that after that surprisingly successful revival, 'The Next Level' doesn't raise the franchise anywhere above that level. The last part of the movie feels narrative rushed and the ending does not hit as hard as I think director/producers hoped it would. Clocking in at 129 minutes, this felt longer than it had to be, while Awkwafina just seem wasted here. Ultimately, I did enjoy ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" more than ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" - which is WATCHABLE, but somehow lifeless fun. To conclude, if you are expecting a fun film, it isn't the worst option, but it definitely isn't the best.Rating: 6+","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

What I liked about the previous one was that it wasn't a remake of the 90s Jumanji but a completely new story, with great special effects, great acting, a solid story and a lot of humor. In the sequel you have double of everything - except humor, in this one it's literally a laugh a minute.
This is a wonderful family action movie that people of all ages can enjoy. So many good things here:
1: The story. Unlike in most Holywood action movies these days, there's actually a solid story that is made even cooler by the fact that it's taking place in a game, which gives the characters lots of different possibilities. The writers utilized that fact and came up with some very original stuff, which makes the movie all the more interesting, and you can't really predict what's gonna happen. I loved this about the previous movie, the twists were really impressive, but this one tops that.
2. The special effects. Finally the effects are used to enhance the already good story rather than replace it, as it's been happening for years in Hollywood movies. That's what effects are for. There are some really ingenious solutions here and it all looks very realistic and it pulls you into the story.
3. The actors have amazing chemistry, just like in the previous movie, but what I really loved was how The Rock was talking like Danny DeVito's character and Kevin Hart stopped yapping for a change and was talking slowly and taking his time to think like Danny Glover's character (which led to some funny developments in the story). There were some character switches in the game, which was really cool, some actors had to change their acting style because of that - which again led to other funny developments.
All characters' stories were very well managed and linked together, and I was really impressed with Nick Jonas' and Awkwafina's acting.
4 The humor. I don't know how the actors could keep a straight face throughout the movie. I LOVED the subdued, sarcastic humor here. You can still make a movie with no stoner humor, no fart jokes, no rude jokes. All the actors are so natural, there's no trying too hard, so they really pull this off.This is a very entertaining movie with tons of positive energy. It will surprise you more than once, and make you feel good. A great heir to the original Jumanji and a fantastic sequel. Keep 'em coming.","15 out of 21 found this helpful.

The ""action"" sequences are a bit more ridiculous, and I had to remind myself that's ""it's a game"".","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Including what's usually the last one saying put your phone away!! But this time there was another 4 after it!!I tend to slate Dwayne Johnson for playing himself in everything, and his movies being forgettable, but it was certainly entertaining to watch Dwayne Johnson impersonate Danny DeVito and Kevin Hart do his best Danny Glover impression!! This is probably more favourite performance by Kevin Hart, cos he wasn't being Kevin Hart!! That was the best thing about the movie for me. I was surprised to see Awkwafina is in this, I'm rapidly becoming a fan of hers, after The FarewellI doubt i'll feel the need to rewatch it, but for the most part, I enjoyed it and laughed a few times, but something happens about an hour in, and then from there it just got a bit flat for me!!There were too many people in my screening to count, (an 11am Wednesday showing) so I expect it to gross a billionTrailers shown were

The Fast and Furious movies are essentially that and I enjoyed those for the most part. I do look forward to being surprised when something I think is going to be a dumb popcorn movie ends up being something more special like Bumblebee or Edge of Tomorrow.This sequel sits on the low end of that spectrum and is a serviceable enjoyable mediocre popcorn flick. The first was a much better example of a turn-off-your-brain fun movie. Nothing deep or memorable, but you'll be entertained for 2 hours. This is literally more of the same with a few players switched around.The worst part of it is the decision to have two elderly characters sucked into the game. Their whole joke in the movie was that they don't understand what is going on. So we are essentially given the exposition explanation for how the world works ALL OVER AGAIN because of these two senior characters. It's not just once, it's their whole joke of the movie. The whole ""old people don't understand stuff"" is their joke for 3/4ths of the movie and it gets old.The Rock for half this movie gives a superbly awful performance feigning a New Jersey accent as he is supposed to be Danny DeVito's character internally. This was a terrible choice as the Rock is just serviceable actor when given the right material, but he does not do accents well at all. Kevin Hart on the other hand does a fantastic impersonation of Danny Glover, though the whole joke of the movie for him is the talks slow. Thankfully there's a body swap towards the last act so The Rock is back to the normal kid. Awkwafina then becomes DeVito and one-thousand percent does a better New Jersey accent. She's honestly the best part of the movie hands down, but doesn't join until halfway in the movie.Besides that terrible Rock performance, the rest of the movie is essentially just a copy of the first movie with a few little things done differently. It's a serviceable way to kill 2 hours and it has a few laughs, but it doesn't do much different than the first did.It's good the ending here alludes to them completely changing the formula in the 4th movie, but this one should have been the one to make major changes.Again it's not terrible, but it's literally just a copy/paste of the first movie with some pieces moved around. It would have been neat to see them change the formula in this one and make it interesting. Maybe had a whole new cast of characters along with Awkwafina's character. But they chose to play it safe and just do similar tropes from the first one.Of all the holiday fare, it's honestly better than Star Wars: TRoS and Frozen 2, so go and see it and enjoy some dumb fun for 2 hours.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

With some time having passed since their daring adventure in Jumanji, they once again find themselves in the video game world battling a new assortment of dangers, only this time they're accompanied by Spencer's old sourpuss grandfather (DeVito), and a former close acquaintance of his (Glover). A few twists allow lead actors Johnson, Hart, Black, and Gillan to really let loose with their personas, but alas, the remainder of the film chooses to play it safe and rehash many of the same elements as its predecessor (and also spend far too much time on frivolous subplots) rather than adding any new complexities to the story, or exploring any truly novel ideas which could've made for a fresh and exciting new chapter. There's action, there's humor, there's special effects...but there were all of those things last time too. **","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The acting was just as good as in the first one, the effects were great, and the story was just a little more done than a film like this requires. The cast really shows their versatility and comedic acting chops in this one, more so than in the last. Of course the action sequences were over-the-top, but well choreographed.This is an action flick, and it is a good one.

There are a lot of hilarious jokes and funny scenes paired with a good dose of adventure and entertainment. The most thrilling scene is the one in which the characters try to cross a maze of rope bridges, where one wrong step can land them in the jaws of ferocious monkeys ready to devour them!The film fairly succeeds in recreating the magic from the previous film. However you feel something amiss as the film progresses. The comedy and thrilling aspects don't really give out the expected impact to the viewer along with the plot which could have been even more interesting!The cast members give a wonderful performance. Dwayne Johnson shines with his 'smoldering intensity', Kevin Hart and Jack Black tickle your funny bone, Karen Gillan bowls you over with her hot moves. Also we get to see Rory McCann ('The Hound' from GOT) in a 'brutal' role.All in all, this film has its fair share of fun & entertainment, although one would have expected something more out of it.

Going into it, I was hoping to get to see characters I loved in the first film return, Spencer, Fridge, Martha and Bethany. I was hoping to see character growth, as expected from a sequel. My excitement quickly dwindled when I realized the movie prioritized the actors over their actual characters. Make no mistake, this movie, is about Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Jack Black, as they play completely different characters from the ones we were introduced. These new characters, Eddie and Milo, add in my opinion absolutely nothing to the story. They simply get in the way of the character growth you'd expect to see in a sequel. Nick Jonas' Alex unnecessarily returns in this sequel, and while I loved him in the first, his character was completely useless to the sequel. Spencer is MIA for the majority of the film, until he becomes Bravestone again and is now the main focus of the movie again.Admittedly, it's dumb fun. There are amusing jokes, I enjoyed the new environments and location. If you're going into it for the characters, for Spencer, Martha, Fridge or Bethany, don't bother. They're not really in it that much.If anything, Jumanji: Next Level should've been a one-shot spinoff movie, and definitely not apart of the trilogy narrative it's trying to go for.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I was happy to hear that the main actors would be playing different people this time. The Rock does a poor job at Danny Devito but Kevin Hart does a fantastic Danny Glover! Aquafina is a great addition, but overall the action just feels less enjoyable, and even the language is annoying, with a lot of religious cussing.

Pick your avatar! Hold on... I accidentally got sucked into the game for a second. Hey everyone, welcome back to Stream To Big Screen. This weekend we were able to review Jumanji: The Next Level. This is the sequel to Jumanji: Welcome To the Jungle from 2017. This movie again stars Jack Black, Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart. This time they welcome a few new old timers to the series Danny DeVito, Danny Glover, and Rory McCann (the Hound).On Level 1, we must discover the plot. If you saw the first one, then you pretty much will get this movie. Basically, the film brings together a ragtag group of individuals who think they know who they are but this game will ultimately help them find out more about themselves. It happened in the first one, and it happens again here. That's not why you come to this movie.*loses a life*On Level 2, you come to this movie to be entertained, pure and simple. The Rock and Kevin Hart work together quite well. Unfortunately, here they don't get to play off of each other as much as I'd like, but they still give some gems. Do not get me wrong, my viewing neighbor and I were cracking up throughout the movie, but at times the jokes got old. Honestly, just thinking about Kevin Hart doing an impression of Danny Glover and Dwayne doing his impression of Danny DeVito's character was quite hilarious; however, by the end of the movie the old people jokes have worn out their welcome.The movie just felt too long - partly because they overused the same jokes.*loses a life* There were a few lulls throughout the movie, but in the times of action or comedy the movie does a good job of keeping you entertained. And, the direction of the action is good enough to make the audience feel as if they are really in a video game, which makes up for some of the lulls in the movie.Final level of this review, Jumanji: The Next Level is a fun family friendly movie. There are laughs for the old folks and the young. If you liked the Jumanji from 2017 you will like this one. I would suggest during this holiday season that you take the kids to a matinee and allow yourself to get sucked into the game.Call it by its name..... JUMANJIIIIIIIIII!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

After a point this film gets pretty boring and predictable, there is only so much CGI you can take. The ladder crossing scene was easily the best scene in the whole film but the rest of film never raises to that level in terms of entertainment. The first film didn't bore me, but this one bores you and there is no real chemistry between the actors and you feel sorry for the young cast as the final resolution doesn't feel earned. Also I saw the film in 4DX, must say I was pretty disappointed. Having sat through quite a few 4DX films now it all feels a bit same and gimmicky to me, but its probably fun for someone who's never experienced it.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

But it a fun entertaining way. We watched it two years after we watched the first one with this basic cast of characters. The main four get sucked in again and become characters quite different from their own selves back home. One of them keeps reminding the others, we are in a game, those are not real. Each has three lives to give, signified by the three black bars on the inside of their arm. When one meets an untimely death, a few seconds later they drop from the sky back to the others, in a fall that would kill a real person. But they are just characters in the game. So they brush themselves off and continue.It was fun for me to see the inclusion of two veteran actors that I have watched many times in many different roles over the years, Danny DeVito and Danny Glover. They play old friends who had become estranged after they quit jointly running a local restaurant, and now must cope with this new existence in the game.Overall forgettable but a crazy entertaining two hours if you are in the right mood. My wife and I watched it on BluRay from our public library, after dinner and wine. The wine probably helped!Crazy!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

1. Voice changes, this really almost ruined the movie for me, just as the avatar doesn't change for the character neither should their voice.
2. Addition of the grandpas who used most of the movie complaining about a restaurant it wasn't funny or necessary, and the forgetfulness got old quick.Danny Devito should have been used as an avator instead of wasting him on a grandpa cast. there could of been some hilarious scenes done with that.3. too much foolishness wasting their 3 lives, there never felt like danger from the enemy's.4. Introducing new player characters randomly, what is this a MMO game ? how would this be possible on the original board game.5. not as funny or serious as the first one-
I was hoping the game would be glitching since it was broken but that wasn't the case, somehow it turned into a multi level game or sequel.after the credits roll the secret scene looked promising (back to the roots? ie original Jumanji), that would be awesome no more virtual lives.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Game side cast once again nails the one person playing another person routine for rich comedy pickings. The underlying messaging of self acceptance and importance of friendship is nicely done too without being too in your face. Shout out to the choreography too, there's a fight sequence near the end which is very well executed and enormous fun. Well lit too.

"7","/10","Jumanji: The Next Level can be best described as Grumpy Old Men if it happened to be an action video game movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5318920/?ref_=tt_urv","RforFilm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26680166/?ref_=tt_urv","13 December 2019","You know what any kid can relate to? Having to explain video games to adults, especially to seniors. Even I, an adult, can still have trouble when my grandmother wants an explanation of the news she hears about Fortnite or something about Nintendo. Looking at it from their perspective, I can't blame them. Video games are toys that are more complex and involve a level of storytelling that's miles away from the traditional ""Cowboys and Indians"" they played as children. Unlike a yo-yo or a Barbie toy that's self explanatory, video games always have different rules and instructions depending on it's genre. So how do you explain something that's always going to be different? I'd say it's best just throwing them in there and let experience be the guide.When it came to learning about game figuring out how to win, it was oddly the premise from Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle. Yes, it may have been a sequel to the 90s classic, but it was also an enjoyable action movie that got several laughs out of me. It was a big enough of hit to gain a sequel. So how do you continue the story without repeating it? Jumanji: The Next Level doesn't repeat...but also does...in a good way.It's been a couple of years and the group of teenager from the first movie, Spencer, Fridge, Martha, and Bethany have all entered college and haven't seen each other in a while. Spencer is concerned that his dull experience in New York and sad demeanor will seem unimpressive compared to what his friends have done. Still, Fridge, Martha, and Bethany meet up at a restaurant to catch up, hoping that Spencer can talk about his troubles. They visit his house to find him, only to be greated by his grandpa Eddie (played by Danny DeVito) and another senior, Milo (played by Danny Glover).The teens go into the basement to find the Jumanji game they thought was destroyed repaired and figure out that Spencer went inside. But just as they touch the controller, they're sucked in without picking their characters. Martha is still Ruby (played by Karen Gillan), but Fridge is now Professor Shelly (played by Jack Black), Eddie is Dr. Bravestone (Played by Dwayne Johnson) and Milo is now Moose (played by Kevin Hart). Along with two old men confused with the new environment their in, the game has changed and they still don't know where Spencer is.Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is a movie I liked, but didn't love. Jumanji: The Next Level is about the same. There's a lot of different things I like...and elements that seem have not changed for no reason. To start off, Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart do a great job imitating Danny DeVito and Danny Glover. It's like watching Grumpy Old Men if it happened to be a video game action movie. And to see the other actors frustrate over their incompetence. Thankfully, they don't go on too long with that gag, though I can't say why without spoiling it.When the movie cuts to the real world, the scenes are also fine, though when it comes to the characters, I don't know why they put Spencer's character back to square one, making him out of his element. I know college is going to be a different experience for kids, but he was the kind of guy who would have gained confidence from that place, let alone from the Jumanji game. I was hoping they'd say he was going through depression or something more. But, nope, he was just feeling self-conscious...because the movie said to.The other teens don't have much in the way dilemmas their going through. This is probably why the majority of the story goes to Danny DeVito and his friendship with Danny Glover. It's a strange thing to put into the Jumanji series, but it works because both are phenomial actors.As a blockbuster, the movie has plenty of action and tries to continue the tradition of jungle animals out on the hunt. It's not as scary as the original Jumanji of the 90s, but I still had fun, especially within a sequence involving rope bridges and a ton of baboons.I'll give this seven Jumanji video games out of ten. This is an example of a movie that may have added new problems, but it also improves of a lot of things. I had fun watching this and I think a lot of families will have fun too. If you hear the drumbeats, it's Jumanji calling, so take a listen.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

That being said, Danny Devito made this movie good and watchable. Liked it, not much of a plot, but some funny moments and I wasn't really expecting much, so it was good enough for me. Really enjoyed Karen Gillan and Awkwafina's performance was just wonderful. The way she pulled off Spencer's weirdness and awkward body language as well as Grandpa Eddie was hilarious. Actually they were all believable in their respective body swaps. The only one strangely enough that I just couldn't see as believable was Martha being Ruby.

All four of the main leads returned and you can see they got to have fun with these new characters, other than Karen Gillan who still played Martha. I will say that I'm not the biggest Kevin Hart, who plays Milo, fan but in this movie, I can see why people like him. He fully embodied playing this seventy-five-year-old man and it made for some humorous scenes. Jack Black, who plays Bethany/Fridge, was a standout in the previous movie and still was a standout in this one. Dwayne ""the rock"" Johnson, who plays Eddie, also did a fantastic job playing an elderly man but I will say that at times he slipped back into his normal voice. I'm not sure if this is just me, but it defiantly worked for the annoying kid sitting next to me, but the comedy didn't really make me laugh that much. There were some points where I chuckled but nothing that made me laugh out loud. Again, this is probably just a me thing but it's just worth mentioning that I found the humour worked best in the previous movie than in this one. The CGI was all right in this movie but nothing really made me go wow. Really my main issue with this movie is how they made it more complicated then it needed to be. The previous one was straight forward and you understood what needed to be done but this movie just throws in some random stuff that it just doesn't need. In the end, Jumanji: The Next Level didn't really need to happen but I'm pretty sure people can enjoy this movie over the holidays. It ends with the possibility of a fourth movie so who knows what will happen.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It does not have any major event happening that changes the goal, and will certainly not be a surprise in the end. Still, enjoyable, with some funny moments but without being too exaggerated.If you can, go with the flow and don't create to much expectations.

The same cast from Welcome to the Jungle all return, with several new characters in Danny Devito, Danny Glover and Awkwafina being introduced.Similar to the previous films, this film incorporates the video game aspect. Perhaps slightly a downgrade yet there is still an entertaining factor to be had, mainly due to the chemistry of the characters. Great action sequences though at some parts it drags on.What was slightly bizarre is the avatar of Dwayne Johnson speaking like the character of Danny Devito. Did not found this to be necessary and at times irritating.Overall solid follow up.

I grew up in the 90's so loved the Robin Williams first film & totally enjoyed the first Dwayne Johnson entry but this sequel ups everything even better & more fun & more heart.The inclusion of two Cinema legends, Danny Glover & Danny Devito was a Genius idea & added another level of Cinema quality to the film. I grew up watching Danny Glover in such Classic's as the Lethal Weapon franchise & the brilliant & underrated Predator 2, I love Danny Glover he's great. I also grew up watching the hilarious Danny Devito in his Classic's such as Twins & Junior, he starred alongside the King of Action Schwarzenegger in both, Love Danny Devito too.
The kids from Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle are back & abit older & seem to have lost much contact with each other so Spencer whilst feeling lost in the world rebuilds the Jumanji game & goes back to the fantasy Game world of Jumanji to feel like he did before as the handsome & beefed up hero Bravestone. The other friends end up going back to Jumanji to find Spencer & bring him back but there's a couple of hilarious twists, one is that all the characters are now mixed up & there in different bodies than before & the 2nd is that Spencer's grandad Eddie & his old buddy Milo have also been sucked into the Game.
Danny Devito playes Eddie & Danny Glover plays Milo, both hilarious as they end up in other bodies & again it's so nice to see this team back together again with Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart (The funniest I've seen him as Danny Glover's slow & soft speaking Backpack guy), Jack Black & Karen Gillian. Everyone on board seems to be having so much fun & it's infectious on screen, this is full of fantastic fantasy fun & action & adventure & some beautiful set pieces but most of all its full of Heart & deals with the fact of life that we all have to grow old!!!
At the Heart of this sweet sequel is the lovely friendship between two old friends now in their 70's (Glover & Devito) & giving life a 2nd chance & having fun & just to appreciate making it to be old.
A fantastic sequel with much more to say & a way better villain & the humour is perfect, stunning sequel.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie knows what it it is and is difficult to watch if you come in with high expectations. The writing is subpar and many jokes don't have the punch they think they have, but there are a few moments that are quite hilarious. The acting teens leaves much to be desired but the Rock, Jack Black, Danny Devito, Danny Glover and Kevin Hart steak the show with the best comedy. This movie is fun but tries too hard to push its message of friendship and growing older. The message does not seem to flow naturally. The scenery is brilliant and truly reminds me of playing a video game with its bright colors and ginormous animals and locations. I recommend going to a good theater as during the desert scenes it was so bright you could see through the screen and see the curtains behind them. It is a good movie to see with friends and have a good time at.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

'Jumanji: The Next Level' is a action adventure-comedy film directed by Jake Kasdan. It is the second sequel to 1995's 'Jumanji', following 2017's 'Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle', and the third installment, overall, in the 'Jumanji' franchise.
I re-watched the first movie, just to refresh my memory. And after watching the new one, I must say - it wasn't underwhelming at all! Another great film from the world of Jumanji. The stakes feel higher and the comedy is still great.
This time, the adventures continue in the fantastic world of Jumanji, where nothing is what it seems to be. The players must return to the dangerous game; however, their characters have exchanged with each other leaving us the same heroes but with different looks. Moreover, they must find out where the rest of the players are in order to beat Jumanji again.
The gang is back together again, and you would expect everybody to be on par with what we've seen from the first film. Unfortunately, Dwayne Johnson doesn't seem in his A-game acting like Danny DeVito. It seems like everybody else was more comfortable with changing their voices to suit their counterparts that differ from the first, but Dwayne Johnson did not seem as comfortable as the rest of the cast.
This movie does not have a deep story, and doesn't try to be anything more than it is, this movie makes you laugh, keeps you entertained and ensures you leave the theater feeling happier than you went in. They added different skills and weakness for all the characters which brought lots of fun and laughs as well. The movie did take a while to get into, and I wasn't fully intrigued until the thirty-minute mark, but then the movie really takes off.
Overall, the movie does take a while to get going, but when it does it goes full force. Some of the characters bring a lot of laughs and entertainment while other take a bit to get used to. Either way you will have a great time with this movie, and I think it is a good sequel.

This movie does have some of the same magic the first movie did with the cast once again doing an amazing job and the jokes delivering some laugh out loud moments but there is also some kick butt action scenes.

Based on Chris Van Allsburg's book ""Jumanji"", Jake, Jeff Pinker, and Scott Rosenberg's screenplay revisits the Jumanji video game world in its next iteration, on ""The Next Level"". That expands the jungle scenario to include the arid desert and snowcapped mountains, along with the vicious villain Jurgen the Brutal, played by generically evil Rory McCann, who seeks some kind of dominance of Jumanji. In this 'next level' there are herds of terrorizing ostriches and baboons, and ominous castles. The cinematography of Gyula Pados is spectacular, as well as the various CGI effects.The game avatars remain the same: Kickass Ruby Roundhouse, played by Karen Gillan, Hero Dr. Smolder Bravestone, played by Dwayne Johnson, Nerdy Professor Shelly Oberon, played by Jack Black, and Zoologist Franklin Finbar, played by Kevin Hart. Yes, Martha, played by bold cautious Morgan Turner - the college student and ex-girlfriend of Spencer, played by Alex Wolff, resumes as Ruby in ""The Next Level"".Yet now, Smolder Bravestone is the avatar of Spencer's Grandfather Eddie, played by sweet crotchety Danny Devito. Frankin Finbar is the avatar of Eddie's estranged best friend Milo, played by kind Danny Glover. Confusing? Well, yeah.Apparently, a lot had transpired since 2017, when the teens returned from the video game world of Jumanji. It's Christmas. Martha enjoyed her single life (post Spencer-life) away in college. She has discovered her freedom. Jock Fridge, played with street swag by Ser'Darius Blain, is on football scholarship. 'It Girl' Bethany, played by whimsical Madison Iseman, studies abroad. Spencer attends NYU, suffering with his part-time job. Alex Wolff captures Spencer's charming uncertainty. The crew agrees to reunite back home at their favorite diner.Spencer returns home to find he's roommates with Grandpa Eddie, who's recovering from hip replacement surgery. 'Mr. Sunshine' Eddie tells his grandson, ""Getting old sucks!"" We get it.Life also sucks for Spencer since his break up with Martha. Attempting to relive the confidence and courage as Bravestone that won Martha's heart, Spencer returns to Jumanji. He had high-jacked the game, storing it in the basement. The Writers are truly reaching here. Just saying.Surmising what happened to Spencer, the Crew decides to go back to Jumanji. Fridge wisely says, ""Are you out of your mind?"" Well, if they listened to him, there would be no movie. Back in Jumanji, Martha's Ruby is all ""WTF?"" Bravestone is now Grandpa Eddie. Franklin is now Milo. So much for the romantic narrative for Martha. Well, sort of.Dwayne and Kevin amazingly channel Danny Devito and Danny Glover's personas, and their forsaken friendship that is both funny and touching. Bravestone catches his reflection of The Rock, handsome muscular swag. He says that he hasn't looked like that in years. Franklin replies, ""You never looked like that."" Hysterical.In the unexpected sweet moment, Bravestone and Franklin talk about the sadness of their lost friendship and mortality. No one does action Hero like Dwayne Johnson, The Rock. No one does smartass like Kevin Hart. They're funny together. They're screen partnership is all heart. That resonates throughout ""The Next Level"".Karen Gillan is genuine surprise. She displays the sense of humanity in all the craziness, embodying Martha's insecurities. Her Ruby can kick the ass of any man. Yet, all she really wants is to be acknowledged for who she is, which is a strong woman.Awkwafina joins the journey as another strong woman as flite thief avatar Ming Fleetfoot, with the initial surprising persona. Awkwafina deftly provides gravitas and humor as Ming, who seems to carry the movie's message: Life is a game. What makes it beautiful are those we get to play the game with.""Jumanji: The Next Level"" is fleeting entertainment. Totally fun. Big hearted. In ""The Next Level"": No, life doesn't really suck. Rather, life is the game you get to create. And that does not suck at all.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie had no signs of identity politics. The writer(s) and director(s) deserve credit for bucking the Hollywood trend.I enjoyed the last Jumanji movie. It was silly, filled with action and had some decent scenes where characters got to know their new bodies. The second movie follows the same basic model, however, it misses the mark by a wide margin. The film is not fresh nor is it interesting.The main problems with this movie are that you don't feel any investment in the characters and nothing particularly interesting happens other than some low-brow jokes that mostly miss the mark. At each stage, I found myself predicting what would happen next and I was fairly close in my predictions. Also, the final 15 minutes were fairly boring. There was no interesting climax. I kept on waiting for the film to finish.What probably tipped this movie from being very good to average was the acting. With some re-shuffling of bodies to characters from the last film, people like the Rock had to play a different personality that's not their usual role. The actors just couldn't pull it off. I believe better actors were needed to swap personalities from what we saw in the last film. Kevin Hart was just not funny at all and he usually makes me laugh, or at least smile.This Christmas box-office will be interesting. A mediocre Star Wars and mediocre Jumanji. Save your money, or see Cats instead.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

I enjoyed not only the plot which I found it interesting and not boring but also the direction which was different than the first movie. I liked the fact that the game had changed and also some other things inside it. Regarding the interpretations, for one more time Jack Black who played as Oberon was simply hilarious, Dwayne Johnson who played as Dr. Bravestone, Kevin Hart who played as Mouse and Karen Gillan who played as Ruby.

""The Next Level,"" the sequel, is a step forward, with a slower pace and a larger ensemble. It's a more delightful return to this universe, according to the reviewer, than its predecessor.""The Next Level"" picks up two or so years after ""Welcome to the Jungle"" ended. Spencer, Martha, Bethany, and Fridge have all gone their separate ways to college. When Spencer fails to show up at brunch, they all visit his home to realize that he put the broken Jumanji video game back together. ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" is more enjoyable than its predecessor. The movie eases away from making Hart the manic presence he was in the previous film.Incorporating two older characters allows the film to investigate other directions. Action scenes are thrillingly intense this time around.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was not a case of ""I've seen that before"". They've put less emphasis on what we already know - from the previous movie - and focussed more on the new storyline.Once again the actors did a great job changing the personalities of their characters (ie. avatars) to reflect their supposedly personalities in the real world. All top notch actors.While the violence is stylised, it might be a tad brutal for the really young ones. But overall, if you want action, adventure, drama and laughter, this movie has it all. A worthy sequel and a worthwhile watch. You will be entertained.Tip: This movie will make more sense if you watch the previous Jumanji (remake) before hand.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

Only this time it's a whole new map, whole new challenges and even a couple of new characters. What's not to love?Okay, the premise itself is pretty similar to the first one, but that's not really a bad thing in this case. It gives us what we want and it's humorous to see the old players reacting with dread to old challenges while the new players are still coming to grips with what's happening.What I don't like is the fact the relationships from the previous film are pretty much reset. Most notably the romance. Why couldn't these two remain together in between films? What's the point of having them romance each other all over again? That's just lazy sequel writing at its worst.Still, the film is entertaining and it's nice to see Johnson, Gillan, Black and Hart playing yet another set of characters who are controlling them. Seeing The Rock trying to pull off Danny DeVito is pure comedy gold.Nothing much to say, really. If you liked the first one, this is more of the same, but in a good way.

If you're looking for a pretty good time at the movies and a few genuine laughs that you will forget by the time you get home, I'd say this is for you. Relies heavily on comedy but lacks major substance.COMEDY:
The movie brings to the table some actual good comedy but it feels like it almost gets to the point where there are too many jokes. The film relies heavily on its comedy. If you take away all the comedic moments, and focus on the plot and character development, you really aren't left with much.ACTION/ADVENTURE:
The action in this film is honestly pretty strong. There are moments you'll like if you enjoy wildlife action, though, some of the scenes seem to overstay their welcome. They last a bit too long in some areas.SUBSTANCE/PLOT
The plot of this movie is pretty easy to grasp, but lacks in some areas or is overshadowed for the sake of an unfunny (or in cases funny but not when it overshadows what could be a great plot point) joke.THEMES:
There are moments in the film where themes could be very strong. For example, there is a scene where hot guy and hot girl (idk the names but y'all get it) are having a heart to heart convo and it's honestly really human and moving but it is one of the few scenes in this movie I wish were longer. If you cut out a couple of jokes or cut short an action sequence to make another scene or two like this, I think the film would've benefited strongly.PACING:
Pacing is good in the film and never really drags or rushes itself in the case of all but a few action scenes.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Director Jake Kasdan assembles the cast for a sequel and gets a for new senior members.It begins with unhappy Spencer (Alex Wolff) coming home for the festive holidays and restarting the console game of Jumanji.His friends Bethany (Madison Iseman), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain) and Martha (Morgan Turner) find out that Spencer has gone into the game and follow him. They get stuck into a new adventure where they need to get a magical necklace from the big bad brutal baddie.It soon comes to light that two new players have been sucked in the game. Spencer's grandfather Eddie (Danny Devito) and his bickering old business partner Milo (Danny Glover). Eddie has no idea what is going on but discovers that he has the body in the shape of Dwayne Johnson's Dr Bravestone.Milo is Franklin 'Mouse' Finbar (Kevin Hart) is a zoologist who talks very slowly and rambles on leaving everyone in danger. Martha has the avatar of the athletic Ruby Roundhouse (Karen Gillan).Jake Kasdan's father Lawrence wrote for both Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. There are elements here that are straight out of Spielberg's playbook. The rampaging ostriches in the desert could easily be Velociraptors in Jurassic Park.There is not much originality in this film. It is very much a retread of the last movie. The characters bicker, Eddie and Milo argue even more regarding their former diner closing down as Milo wanted to retire.The characters encounter dangers such as rampaging monkeys, they sometimes die in hilarious situations and lose a life. The main difference being that avatars can be swapped and this time the avatars also have weaknesses.The movie was too long with too many dull moments and the feeling you have seen it all before. The antagonists were wasted as they only played a minor part in the film.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Jumanji, it is, after all, exactly a new level of the same game, has good comedy and turns out to be sincere entertainment","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6547934/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","31 January 2021","Certainly, ""Next Level"", as in a good video game, keeps the main components of what came before, while adding enough new bits to keep things playable. Although this is a sequel with characters we already know and has an even more fun narrative dynamic, perhaps the most positive element of Jumanji - Next Stage is the addition of characters that know nothing about the world of video games - and that the public did not know until So. Again under the command of Jake Kasdan, the second chapter of the franchise mixes nostalgia with innovation and manages to be inventive at certain times, but still follows a conventional primer to entertain its audience.There are few conflicts in the plot as a whole, which certainly limits the film to taking big steps towards the more detailed development of that world or some character - with the exception of Danny Glover and DeVito, of course. The duo, which gives life to Milo and Eddie, respectively, bring unexpected layers to the production. I would even say that the heart of this film resides in the form and themes that both figures carry with a quick background that immediately puts a certain comic friction between them. However, this is never taken very seriously, because at all times we notice the care they have for each other. The veterans, in addition to giving a humorous freshness to the previous dynamic, not so repetitive, present their own interaction, rescuing a little of the classic discourse in the construction of messages in favor of breaking the pride and facing the past. The game becomes a catalyst for feelings and a new opportunity for a fresh start in a friendship. The script also, surprisingly, subtly discusses old age and its facets in the modern world. In this sense, inserting them in the midst of young people in a universe that is physically and metaphorically so hostile generates at least curious moments. Mainly, it happens because of the work of the group of actors, who represent the avatars, formed by Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Karen Gillan and mainly Kevin Hart, who is priceless emulating Glover's antics.On the other hand, there is not so much brilliance in the core of young people who bring selectable characters to life, with Alex Wolff, Morgan Turner, Ser'Darius Blain and Madison Iseman still not having so much screen time and this decision doesn't seem to be free. Although none compromises, even for the simplicity of everything that presents itself, we are waiting for the moment that they will return to the game. Exactly the opposite of the scenes shared by Glover and DeVito. Thus, both in the imaginary world and in the mundane life, Milo and Eddie had beautiful and accurate outcomes. Also talking about the epilogue, the film has a post-credits scene that will make the most ardent fans of ""Jumanji"" thrill with joy.As it is a ""new level"", as the film's title already says, avatars have upgrades, although they still bring elements from the previous phase. While Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle (2017) was more adventurous, these novelties bring the film even closer to comedy, without forgetting, of course, the adventures involving animals - a trademark since the book published by Chris Van Allsburg in the 1980s. at this point, it is interesting to see that with the additions to the production, we see more versatility of the main actors, such as The Rock playing a grumpy gentleman, Hart giving life to a calm-spoken elderly, and even Black being a teenage athlete. Awakafina, in turn, also lives different personalities while playing Ming, the avatar of a thief within the game. The exchange of roles between the actors is one of the highlights of the feature and can generate a good laugh.Next Level is actually a DLC from the previous one, an expansion with new characters, scenarios, challenges and dilemmas, but that are still part of the same game, in this case, the same film. So, it is impossible to say that it is a continuity, no matter how much it tries to mature some relationships, they will be taken to the same ends, just as the gameplay will be about the same destination: ""Save Jumanji"". Thus, the same problems as the predecessor appear, in particular, the artificiality of the mission, which is the most uncomfortable. Even though it is ""intentional"" because it is artificial, being a game, it seems that this fact is used as a crutch for the film to be able to do what it wants. In addition to being a disservice to the entertainment modus operandi, it makes the world's previously established dangerousness rules useless. There is a scene in which two characters' fight and one takes a life from the other on purpose, even though each one has only two, as if they already knew that the last one would not be lost, and the previous film establishes that to die there is to die in life real. Another scene, in which another character, who comes close to the end without having lost any life, dies twice in the same trap, even though he already knows about its functionality, just to create an equality with the others. These are just examples to demonstrate how the film trivializes game aesthetics as a mere protocol. So, if it was already difficult to relate or care about the size of the adventurous journey previously, who knows now that it is already fulfilled.The plot is not really the strong point here, from bringing any excuse to return to the world of Jumanji until when then entered this universe, the objective is impossibly more generic. The villain Jurgen, The Brutal played by Rory McCann sums it up well. There is no problem in this case, as the story serves only as a guideline for humorous shots and action scenes that drink heavily from Professor Jones's adventures - the progress of the bridge with the monkeys, for example, seems to have come out of a sequence of the ""Indiana Jones"" saga. It is not by chance that the director and screenwriter is the son of Lawrence Kasdan, the screenwriter of ""The Raiders of the Lost Ark"". And in that sense, the set pieces are really great, especially taking on ostriches with an air of ""Mad Max"". A nice catch from the new Kasdan. These sequences, by the way, are extremely well executed, with exquisite action and comedy coexisting, helped even more by the excellent visual effects.Furthermore, everything is so well structured and, at the same time, light, that the characters without the human conscience of the players (multiplied in relation to the predecessor of 2017) assume their participation as an authentic comedy. Flame (Dania Ramirez), for example, has a visibly programmed sensuality and, in addition, Knife (Massi Furlan) is an unlikely brutality typical of a villain with a halter - without any chance to deviate from his perverse focus. Everything - absolutely everything - is developed with the main function of generating a plausible universe in itself. The action sequences within the video game are longer and take up more time than the previous adventure, giving the plot a real ""adventure game"" feel. The performances, the script (and his jokes), the visual effects that contribute to the result and are never there as mere artifice ... the whole set is part of something bigger, of Kasdan's proposal as director to make these films something, in fact, functional. On this side, realizing that even silly character comments can sound like an almost metalinguistic tool is fun. It is as if, when they discover what their new strengths can do and confess these discoveries aloud, they are giving voice to a gamer who, playing with his friendships - comments the same aloud.In the end, Jumanji - Next Level goes beyond comedy and action to deliver an exciting ending related to a character who knows himself better from the game's adventures. Therefore, it is curious that the person in question knew nothing of this technology, but he is more amazed than all the other characters. Technology embraced him in a simple and quite sincere way too, bringing a somewhat poetic message to those who pay more attention: the possibility of feeling embraced by a technology as archaic as it is engaging, which gives a new reality out of fear (whether to die or be forgotten). Jumanji's meaning reaches the level of representing the chance for freedom; not only physical but also emotional.Jumanji, it is, after all, exactly a new level of the same game. Or better: the original title refers to level. That said, it is the same story (or almost that), the same characters (or almost that) with an added difficulty for the players. These who, being the same (or almost that), act in a similar way, but with what they learned in the previous phase - at the level actually. The two films by Jake Kasdan manage, better than any other copy, to combine cinema and game in an organic way. This is because it is based on the union of the two and not on the transformation of each other. It's cinema with the heart of a game, but it's still cinema. Of course, it may be that you remain in a comfort zone by not moving the pieces towards direct interaction with the audience, but, in any case, it has fun and turns out to be sincere entertainment.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

If you liked that one you will like this. It is very much just more of the same. If it ain't broke, you know.A couple new faces, one of them I really liked seeing. Won't say who it was, but if you're older than 20, chances are good you like the person.The action is like last time, it's entertaining, but not mind blowing. The effects are overall good. The Rock has some, lets call them punching scenes, which I liked. Although the action direction overall, could have been slightly better, tighter.They once again have fun with the fact that the characters ""in game"" represent characters in the movies ""real life"". And I am pretty impressed with how the actors fared. Maybe especially Dwayne Johnson. (I think he's taking some serious acting classes, he's getting better) Overall the cast in this is very likeable.I didn't feel quite that much that I was in a video game, this time around though. Felt more like just an adventure, than an adventure videogame. They could have hammered home a little better. So yeah, I was entertained, but it's pretty shallow and won't stick with me like, say, the origianl Jumanji. (I watched that as a kid, and it was kind of revolutionary, so of course it stuck) Nice family flick.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I couldn't wait for this sequel to drop, but instead of wowing me it dropped the ball indeed. The new characters, albeit played by legends of the game Danny Glover, and Danny DeVito, do not belong in this storyline...and the addition of Akwardfina is just a complete disappointment. Not only is she a horrible actress in general, but she can't even make slapstick in a children's film believable. Johnson, Hart, Black and Gillan do a fabulous job once again and the writers Jake Kasdan and Jeff Pinkner seem to have taken the magical world of Jumanji to the next level yet again. If it weren't for the lame acting at the onset and the addition of these random characters who do nothing to progress the plot, slow the action and dialogue to a snails pace as though the audience were having to look over their shoulders and wonder where grandpa is, it might be just as great as it was meant to be. It's definitely worth a watch, but it's not nearly as good as it could have been. Leaves ya laughing in scenes, frustrated in scenes and afterwards looking at the rest of the family and saying a general meah.","9 out of 23 found this helpful.

And what a linear level this is. After the overall outline, and outcome, of the interesting first period we are succumb to a rather dislodged affair of what, at best, can only be described as a Kentucky Derby of low standard, puerile and noticeably immature game to catapult this embarrassing farce; To enthral is target audience that, as seen, has now dropped to a lower age of understanding that this witless wonder is demeaning of any sense of wit and imagination. This is not merely poor execution of script, at its very core, it is at a level that does not hold its audience in any regard for its art; lazy is too cliché at best, this is a level of the lowest form of direction and experience in film.Once more, we have all the four friends of the previous quest cantering along in the frolics of a new adventure; a new game and fresh locations and each being mixed and stirred with avatars that are based on, and around, their last gathering, at least.It is in this new gathering that we see the dreary four and we bear witness to a small group of friends, who lacking in chemistry, charisma and charm, produces simply too little screen presence here to fill the audience with delight and wonder; it's all a tedious affair, even to the point of adding new faces to the game, Messer's Awkwafina, Glover and DeVito, and their respective personalities', cannot pull this from the quagmire of its astonishingly dull script and poor lacklustre avatar building disaster. There simply is no true aura, no honest connection amongst this new mindset between the players; What was once had is now, regrettably, misplaced and removed. Age has most certainly refused to gather pace but placed a regression of personality and having receded into childlike banter and juvenile charade. Already, by the second level, this has promptly turned into self-parody.","7 out of 17 found this helpful.

At this point, I hope they make 20 films together and I'll be there for every single one. And even in Jumanji: The Next Level, where for the majority of the screen time they are mimmicking Danny Devito and Danny Glover, they are magnetically charismatic, if that's even a phrase. As a whole, the film is more than a worthy sequel to the surprise 2017 film where a video game traps 4 teenagers into a made up world known as Jumanji. In terms of structure, the 2nd film isn't all that different but it succeeds with its enormous heart, winning script, and performance from its 4 main leads and expanded supporting cast. Hopefully The Next Level continues to crush at the box office and the series will live on for many more films.8.7/10","8 out of 11 found this helpful.

Once again, this film follows young Spencer (Alex Wolff) but this time Spencer is struggling with a few personal issues including a recent break up with his girlfriend. Spencer also lives long distance from all his close friends. We soon discover that Spencer still has the smashed up and busted Jumanji video game console from the previous film. Spencer attempts to repairs the console and manages to renters the world of Jumanji. Soon his friends figure out Spencer's recent activity and decide to also renter the game to try and rescue their friend. But this time the game is different; Jumanji is a different world. The players and the avatars have also changed. The players will venture through the Jungle, Desert & Snowy Mountains while looking for Spencer along the way.As a third instalment I was generally excited to see this film. For those who are curious, I gave the last instalment, Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle (2017), a score of 7.0/10. It was creative, fun and a worthy sequel to the 1995 film - RIP Robin Williams.Thankfully Jumanji: The Next Level (2019) brings new and fresh ideas to the screen. There are new elements introduced to make this video game world more relatable for 2019. Plus! While actors are the same, their personalities are different this time. This was exciting and fresh to see, particularly when it came to the actors Dwayne Johnson & Kevin Hart.While there are many elements that are fresh, there are minor issues with the film. Some of these include a weak and forgettable villain. While I enjoyed The majority of this film, it also feels far too long, especially when you reach the third act. This act also didn't carry the same level of humour or pacing in my opinion.Overall, considering this is a third instalment to the world of Jumanji, I'm proud to say it's another positive film for the franchise. While the level of creativity is higher, I only had a few personal issues with this film including a weak villain and that the film's general run time was a bit long. No matter my opinion, there's still plenty of fun moments to have here. I'm honestly excited and curious to see if the creators of this film will roll the dice for a 4th instalment. 6.9/10 - Walkden Entertainment","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

In my eyes, the original Jumanji (1995) is an untouchable classic, with no reboot or sequel necessary. Recently this year, however, I decided to give it the benefit of the doubt and found myself pleasantly surprised. While incomparable to the original, it was a perfectly fun film in its own right with a likable cast and enough enjoyable set pieces to keep the adventure moving. With Jumanji: The Next Level, the adventure continues with Johnson, Gillan, Black and Hart reprising their roles once again. Three years have passed since the events that transpired in Welcome to the Jungle, and Spencer (Alex Wolff) misses the world of Jumanji as he grows ever more dissatisfied with his own reality. After he returns to the world of the game, his friends seek out to rescue him in order to confront him as to why he felt the need to return. Much to their surprise, the rules of Jumanji have changed due to faults with the system, resulting in some hilarious body swap blunders along the way.Along with the four primary cast members (including new additions Danny DeVito & Danny Glover), Jake Kasdan also returns as director and, this time, co-writer. While there isn't a whole lot of difference between Welcome to the Jungle and The Next Level, I wouldn't exactly call that a bad thing. Just like its predecessor, this third chapter in the Jumanji-verse is another fun voyage with plenty of exciting set pieces, witty humour and just enough heart to ensure the whole affair doesn't ring hollow. The ensemble cast (accompanied this time by Awkwafina) remain a great fit and maintain their strong chemistry shared from their preceding outing, as do their younger counterparts who we begin and end the film with. The films antagonist, Jurgen the Brutal (Rory McCann), is, while serviceable enough, the films weakest element. While it doesn't stand out as one of this years most memorable films, Jumanji: The Next Level is still perfectly enjoyable escapism that is worth a watch if you enjoyed 2017's reboot/sequel.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Knowing and witty, it played with its dynamic nicely and was funny and entertaining. Less impressed with this sequel though, that seems more like ""downloadable add on"" rather than a whole new adventure.Disappointed with how his college life isn't matching up to his time in the game, Spencer (Alex Wolff) renters Jumanji. His friends attempt a rescue, but unfortunately, Spencer's grandfather Eddie (Danny DeVito) and his former business partner Milo (Danny Glover) are pulled in as well. The heroes deal with not playing as their previous characters, as well as their two elderly interlopers whilst trying to rescue Spencer and save Jumanji once more.The immediate reason why I don't think ""The Next Level"" works is unfortunately, because of the new dimensions brought it by Danny DeVito and Danny Glover. When they enter the game the idea of having two older people in it is funny for the first couple of minutes, but once that's over you're left with The Rock and Kevin Hart rumbling over the same lines and gags repeatedly. It doesn't help that for all their genuine talents, neither of them is particularly good at mimicking the actors they're supposed to be inhabiting. It's no coincidence that the film is markedly better in the last twenty minutes, when everybody McGuffins back into the characters they played last time. Call me a ""Snowflake"" or whatever you like, but I found the scenes when Jack Black and Karen Gillen pretended to be Anthony's character uncomfortable.The rest of the film is fine, the plots ... meh, the set pieces are sufficient, the visuals are OK - but it's all definitely inferior to last time. The credits scene sets up a sequel in the real world, which to be honest, I'd quite like to see - let's let the kids have their own film.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

They plan to get back together to catch up but Spencer doesn't turn up. He has been feeling down and restarts the Jumanji game. When 'Fridge', Martha and Bethany go to his house they find Eddie, his crotchety grandfather, along with his former business partner, Milo, but no sign of Spencer. They decide they must enter the game to find him. Things don't go as expected... Fridge and Martha end up in different game characters than before and Bethany is left behind... and rather bemused Eddie and Milo end up in the game. It isn't long before an NPC gives them their quest... they will have to face various challenges before they can leave the game; they also still need to find Spencer.Often sequels are a little disappointing but I found this to be as much fun as the original. The main actors are back playing four game avatars but thanks to a fun twist each is playing a different 'real world' person. There is almost non-stop action once they are in the game; this provides plenty of thrills and a similar number of laughs. The effects are impressive and the cast does a great job. Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Jack Black and Kevin Hart really impress as the four main avatars and Danny DeVito and Danny Glover are fun in the real world roles of Eddie and Milo. Awkwafina is a good addition as new avatar Ming Fleetfoot and Rory McCann is suitably menacing as villain Jurgen the Brutal. The story is pretty simple but serves its purpose of delivering action and laughs. Overall a lot of fun from start to finish; well worth watching if you enjoyed the first film.","9 out of 13 found this helpful.

Jumanji 3, or Jumanji 2 if ""Welcome to the Jungle (2017)"" was your first experience, brings the group back together again. It's been a year since the events of the previous film, the gang have all gone their own ways - even Spencer and Martha aren't talking much anymore despite connecting last film. Despite the year that has passed the game still has a way of pulling them back to Jumanji, with a couple of unexpected players added to the mix too. This time, the game has changed, instead of the jungle they are challenged with snowy mountains and arid deserts. New challenges and new dangers await the gang as they attempt to beat the game, in order to escape.Given that this, in video game terms, is the next level - Level 2, there is a marginal step up in difficulty for the players to deal with within the plot of the film. That being said though, I didn't think that the film pushed any boundaries, it was just a lot more of the same. I guess the question to be asked then is, why change a formula that seemed to work last time? Reboots don't often deliver successfully, ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" bucked a trend and didn't disappoint audiences, so why go changing things drastically? The answer is it didn't; it was a little 'samesy' as the last outing - but that doesn't mean it wasn't fun though. This is a charming and fun film which would be suitable for family audiences. The cast all deliver fine performances, both as kids and as their video game avatars.The film delivered laughs and emotions, plenty of adventure, a little character development (from the first film) and, well, it was just simple and easy to watch - hardly rocket science, which in this instance is a good thing. I do not generally have any complaints, the film was decent for what it was, it delivered what was being advertised. It is neither better, nor worse than the previous instalment, and as such I'll give it the same rating of 7 out of 10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Set three years after the now four best friends survived the first adventure, Spencer, consumed by his comparatively dull adolescence, returns to Jumanji where he felt he had substantial purpose as an individual. His friends, worried after not showing up to a friendly reunion, suddenly hear the beat of jungle drums, realising that Spencer has activated Jumanji once more. Only this time, ""Fridge"" and Martha are taken leaving Bethany in reality. Resulting in Spencer's grandfather and long-time business partner Milo being transported to the fictitious world instead as Dr. Bravestone and Finbar respectively. Naturally, the older generation attempting to understand the mechanics of a video game (NPCs, three lives, strengths and weaknesses etc.) creates an unadorned amount of comedy that equally diminishes the character of Roundhouse to nothing more than expositional tutorials.Much of the laughter is expelled at the sights of Johnson and Hart mildly impersonating DeVito and Glover. Whilst the latter has the slow tempo down perfectly, the former is the least ""The Rock"" we've seen him as since, well, ever. Watching him attempt the New Jersey/New York accent was mildly hilarious to say the least. This sequel really revolves around these two characters, whom share a jaded past that seeks reconciliation. Unlike the ""Jaguar's Eye"", they are the true heart of Jumanji. Adequate development to make their differences affecting, without relinquishing much of the humour. Their new strengths and weaknesses, including communicating with animals and Bravestone acquiring just one weakness that was admittedly vastly underdeveloped, appropriately utilised to produce a change of pace when comparing to its predecessor. And, above all else, funnier than their initial appearance. Spencer controls a new avatar, played by the dominating Awkwafina, who really asserts her presence amongst the pre-existing avatars. Oberon, with Black on cruise control, mostly assists with the exposition while indicating his weakness to desert characteristics.Speaking of arid horizons, the jungle has been substituted for the desolation of heat, a dense woodland environment and snow-capped mountain, as the team attempt to reclaim the ""Falcon Jewel"" from warlord Jurgen the Brutal in order to save Jumanji and return to reality. The same criticisms from the first film apply here. The narrative is ridiculously linear and mundanely straightforward that, half the time, the screenplay itself forgets what the main objective is. The feature works best when divulging in exciting character-based set pieces, to which Kasdan acknowledges this by throwing the core contents of the plot to the side for the vast majority of the adventure. It's the exact same premise, just a different location. Kasdan also moderately relies on humour setup in the previous entry, such as Roundhouse fighting villainous NPCs through the medium of rhythmic combat to the tune of ""Baby I Love Your Way"" (ooof such a tune!), which also heightens the sense of over-familiarity. Although, Hart shouting ""No!"" to cake ensured many howls! The villain, Jurgen, much like Professor Van Pelt (remember him? Me neither!) was instantly forgettable and provided minimal menace. The visual effects were noticeably digital, particularly the backdrops, however closeups of ostriches and mandrills certainly harnessed attentive detail.One could argue that the digitised gimmicks and hokey plot conveniences are all part of the game world, and they would be correct. Kasdan once again provides fantastic family entertainment that relishes in bold characterised set pieces, albeit with another less than substantial plot. Employing the exact same formula that made its predecessor a financial success, with a few avatar changes here and there. Granting profitable amounts of replay value in the process.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

As Martha, Bethany and Anthony look forward to reuniting for the holiday season, Spencer distracts himself by rebuilding the destroyed games console from the first instalment.It doesn't take long for the gang to realise that Spencer has returned to the world of Jumanji, but this time they have some surprising company in Spencer's Grandpa (Danny DeVito) and ex-business partner, Milo (Danny Glover).Dwayne Johnson and co do a stellar job with the new adventure, as do the new additions, and while there are plenty of laughs and impressive action sequences, one can't help but feel that the writing has missed a trick. The screenplay is just not quite as good - the pacing lags at times and there are portions of the movie that are pretty dialogue heavy - so not so great for the younger ones who would want to see this movie.That said, it's a fun watch. It's been made with love and you can tell, Karen Gillan continues to shine and the film builds to a satisfying climax. The extra comedic moments allowed by having two senior citizens (DeVito and Glover) also helps provide some real highlights and laugh-out-loud scenes.While not quite hitting the heights of its predecessor, this is still a great watch that will entertain the family for years to come.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Here is this Jumanji the next episode. First one was awesome very funny and true to the name Dwayne Johnson. But this second part was honestly boring from the first minute to the very last. Couldn't find any jokes and I was struggling to keep my attention on the screen. This is not what I expected from The Rock knowing he turns everything into gold. It's a shame in my opinion. Otherwise Karen Gillan is beautiful.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Following a similar plot to its predecessor - people land in video game, get specific powers, must get gem in surreal surroundings to get back - the main twist is that the four lead actors have to play different characters.It's actually a decent idea, until it results in Johnson's terrible attempt at De Vito's character. Hart is actually a pretty good Glover, providing the only slight laughs, with an old man's comments to himself. Surprisingly Awkwafina's De Vito impression is a whole lot better than The Rock's, and she deserves credit for bringing something to the film other than the typical typecast characters. Jack Black is again brilliant playing the shallow teenage girl, however playing a young black man does not sit right. The impersonation fluctuates and at times is just wrong.Visually it's pretty good, and in keeping with the video game environment, but it's long for what it is, kind of entertaining but also utterly forgettable. Not as good as the first one, definitely not as good as the original.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Well, this movie upgraded it's cast from the first one, and it doesn't lose a thing versus the earlier film. I'm not sure if an arcade now will be in time to save our mall (though it would help if they brought movie theaters back into too), but this movie is entertaining and a whole lot of funny.Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Heart, and additions like veteran Danny Devito are all positive in this one. The plot is exactly the same as the first time around, another video game of Jumanji only with real people thrown into the game. If anything, the script is a solid item indeed and the cast brings it off.The film never gives a viewer much chance tro rest. There's action on top of action, just like the video game. If they make enough of these, there will come a day when a marathon of them will be playing, and playing and playing and maybe, just maybe the next game will rescue our ailing mall. A lot of malls are being turned into Senior Housing. Rushing in a good game of Jumanji could improve sales- at the Tom Brady Scooter store.Put your brain away and enjoy this action film.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

And that is something that I rarely say.The story is great. It is extremely clever. There are multiple homages to the first of the ""reboot"" movies but without repeating anything from what came before. Visually it is stunning. Above all though it was hugely entertaining.But the best thing for me was the acting. The actors playing the avatars were wonderful. You were left in no doubt throughout the movie who were the ""people"" behind the avatars. Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Jack Black all put it wonderful performances (which is not to diminish any of the others). Dwayne Johnson is often harshly dealt with in reviews, but in this movie he shows that he can really act.To summarise: I am amazed just how well they pulled it off and at the same time made a better movie.Edit: I see there are a number of people who are down voting this hard and even suggesting that the high reviews are shills. Well I have edited this to tell those poor misguided souls that this is a genuine review. I could not disagree more with all of the negative 1/10 and 2/10 reviews. This is a great entertaining movie.

First Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Jumanji: The Next Level. Back we go to the land/game that is Jumanji. Spencer is not doing well and having saved the old game console from total destruction he disappears and his friends realise he has gone back inside the game. Off they go to rescue him. So that was a little bit confusing. Forget who was in which body last time, and open your mind to the wonders that include Danny de Vito inside Dwayne Johnson's body. There is some superb acting from Dwayne as we totally see the character of Danny throughout. He's becoming a great comedic talent. Oh and he still smoulders. The game players discover they have new strengths and weaknesses which bring out whole new ways to die. Lots of action and a fair bit of humour provide a good old jolly family film just in time for Christmas. Did I mention Dwayne Johnson still smoulders.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

However, the rules are different, there are new deadly locations & there are additional players.Jumanji: The Next Level is a fantastic film. Director Jake Kasdan has given us a movie, that is as action-packed & hilarious as its predecessor. The new locales make for more thrilling set pieces, each more insane than the previous one. The visual effects are flawless. The 3D is eye-popping. The performances are the highlight of the film. Dwayne Johnson is spectacular as Bravestone. Jack Black is mesmerizing as Oberon. Kevin Hart is outstanding as Mouse. Karen Gillan is amazing as Ruby Roundhouse. Awkwafina is brilliant as Ming. Johnson, Black, Hart, Gillan & Awkwafina have given us performances unlike anything we've seen from them before. Nick Jonas is good as Seaplane. Rory McCann is great as Jurgen the Brutal. Alex Wolff, Morgan Turner, Ser'Darius Blain, Madison Iseman, Danny DeVito, Danny Glover & Marin Hinkle are awesome as Spencer, Martha, Fridge, Bethany, Eddie, Milo & Spencer's Mom, respectively. The supporting cast is impressive. Jumanji: The Next Level is a must watch for fans of Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle(2017).

"4","/10","A decent quality movie at 1st sight until the latter time, the next level in runtime, darkness and a downward spiral","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5672947/?ref_=tt_urv","georgenlee-61866","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur96638325/?ref_=tt_urv","24 April 2020","Jumanji was a hit since the original came out and the original had such a 1 of a kind plot that made it famous and adventurous yet good for many to watch. This one while had good visuals and a story, didn't match to the original. 1st of all different cast members, starring Dwayne Johnson (the Rock), Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Karen Gillan, and Nick Jonas. They did fine on their roles though you will NEVER get another like Robin Williams (who committed suicide by hanging too soon R.I.P.). The action was fitting for Jumanji movies and certainly a step over the original, plus quite the adventure of movies, including intense scenes with creepy jungle animals, which added to the story. Now the movie was even longer than the 1st, up to 2 hours 3 minutes compared to the 1 hour 44 minute original movie, so just 2 minutes shy of the original 1977 Star Wars movie Episode IV - A New Hope. Now it's definitely flawed, in fact BIG TIME! with the massive amount of profanity in this movie, like 50 swear words in total, more than what most movies have, with 6 uses of God's name in vain being taken in that way and many uses of the H word and D word along with many others including the F word. I get they wanted to give this the PG-13 route but this was extreme even for that in such matters. Yet like I said earlier it was darker than the original in action sequences. I know action movies are enjoyable but some of the types used in this are going over the edge for what would've been a family movie. This isn't Star Wars, Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter, but neither is this supposed to be Sesame Street, this is supposed to be Jumanji, a fine balance which the original had but this pushed that boundary. Too bad a pity some movie franchises choose to take a darker route as they go on, like Harry Potter did that and so did Narnia and even Star Wars. Same thing with Jumanji. Yet this movie is unique though another flaw happens even before watching the movie, with the fact that I realized when it was in theaters, the theaters including staff and entrances didn't put up warning signs that the cinematography would involve tons of handheld camera work in scenes, making the footage shaky, which can trigger dizziness/motion sickness in susceptible guests and that viewers prone to motion sickness should either sit next to the entrance/exit door or ask the cashier for further admission or just not watch, yet it was definitely different from the 1st movie in that matter as well. I mean also think about the people who might've gotten sick watching this movie, yet the 3D aspects in the 3D versions makes such matters even worse for them. If movies like the Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, District 9, Project Almanac, Jason Bourne, Battle LA or Earth to Echo make you sick, then its the same with this (and Rogue One + Solo). Not everyone's in the same health or physical shape anyway. Anyway the acting as well didn't live up to the original standards and this movie definitely made no match to the original. It's an example of how some sequels (including this) fall flat and inferior to the originals. Some just try to hard to be as good and don't. Now don't get me wrong, it's better than what Star Wars became since the sequel trilogy (and after George Lucas sold it to Disney), but it's not as good as the original and nor is it as family friendly either, with full of profanity along with intense scenes and especially sexual innuendos. If you loved the the 1st movie, then don't go in expecting this to be as innocent as the original. It's definitely the mature version of Jumanji. Just like how Indiana Jones went dark with their most famous hit Raiders of the Lost Ark, this movie took a dark step and took the family-friendly aspect away. This movie doesn't even get 5 stars due to such reasons. While this was refreshing compared to lots of movies out there in quality and storyline, it's not the breath of fresh air you're looking for whereas Mary Poppins Returns was a better sequel to an original movie (like Mary Poppins) than this was to the original Jumanji. Yet you could also watch YouTube clips of it or YouTube fanfilms or even vlogs by the cast members, which this ""movie"" practically was. Never forget the legendary Robin Williams who made the original Jumanji classic and the fact that no one will ever live up to his quality in the movie industry or Jumanji's movies anymore. R.I.P. Robin Williams.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

What makes this film and the last one so captivating, and simply exciting, is the use of situational comedy and the actors performances of others inside their bodies. The film not only improves that fact here, by having different people take a part in it, but also doing the same as well. The main cast throughout the film delivers delightful performances, with the actual people they are portraying now being at least a bit better than they had been portraying their shallow characters from the first one. It is however, easy to forgive the last film from this flaw, as the characters continue to grow in the script in a slightly corny but mostly meaningful way you get to see on screen. The script can be a little messy at times, but its all for good fun, and although some jokes never seem to truly land, the film is plenty full of laughs to satisfy. In the end, the new Jumanji is hardly a perfect film, but it is better than the last, and as the franchise goes on, will hopefully continue to improve in the future.

When the kids came in I was let down quick, I saw the short documentary of the making of Jumanji and the kids weren't in it, so was expecting some new cast. They really weren't needed here because their stories had already been told, because most elements of the movie revolved around them and it made the movie incredibly boring. Having Rory MCann as a lifeless character was a waste of a good actor and his time spent was also brief. Dwayne, Jack, Kevin, and the two Girls were ok, they really weren't given much to work with and honestly at times their characters are ridiculous and unbelievable, but I don't blame them at all. The story is very weak in this movie and what annoyed me the most was the Political Correctness shoved in my face, I don't care who gets along with who, I want to see an exhilarating story where every moment is unpredictable and gripping like the original Jumanji film. This movie is just safe and tries to suck up to an audience with certain political beliefs.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

This film is directed and partly written and produced by Jake Kasdan, who also directed the second Jumanji film.The friends from the previous film discover that the Jumanji game broke down. Spencer (Alex Wolf) tried to repair the game with his own hands, but got stuck in the game. The friends decide to go back into the game themselves to save Spencer. Once back in the game, the friends learn that they are in the body of a different avatar than the last time. Two new players also traveled with the friends into the game, namely Spencer his grandfather Eddie (Danny DeVito) and his friend Milo (Danny Glover). The friends need to explain to the new players what's going on and learn what they have to do in the game this time, to finish the game and be able to return to the real world.
With this new film they have expanded the world of the game by bringing the characters to new places such as arid deserts and cold snowy mountain areas. All these new locations provide new opportunities for suitable action scenes. Despite the new entertaining action scenes, the humor and comedy of the film still comes across as predictable and repeated. The best comedy comes from putting the characters in other avatar bodies. This way you have the little Danny DeVito in the body of the big muscular Dwayne Johnson. Also the quiet older Danny Glover in the body of the busy Kevin Hart.For the new locations in the film, they have really traveled to places to film here such as Canada and New Mexico. With the animals in the film you can still see that they were placed in the film with CGI, just like with the previous film. Because the film is set in a video game, they can use this as an excuse, just like they did in the previous film.The acting is also well done by the cast. It is nice to see the actors now playing their characters in a different way by putting the characters in the different avatar bodies. The film loses some comedy that came to the fore in the second part such as a popular teenage girl in the avatar body of Jack Black. It is special to see Kevin Hart playing a quiet role with the older Danny Glover in the body of his avatar. Kevin Hart is more known for playing excessively busy roles, but he knows how to stay calm for most of this film.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I loved the first one a lot. This one not so much. I was worried when I saw the trailer that it wouldn't be amazing. And unfortunately I was correct. The acting was terrible along with the story. No character development like the first one and no funny moments. It seems that this was rushed and not thought about more thoroughly. I honestly hated that I hated this movie. I really didn't want to. It was boring and I honestly gave it forty minutes before I skipped through it. I found that I had missed nothing and it was just still the same. I think the biggest mistake was not having every character be the same. Actually I wish this movie was never made.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I was especially impressed by the improv the Rock, Jack Black, Awkwafina, and Kevin Hart did for their characters in different bodies. That had me laughing the whole entire time! There were a surprising number of twists involving who was in the game and what character they were portraying. And something happened near the end that ALMOST had me sobbing (then again I don't really cry, but it did have me feeling sad) which I won't spoil. There's some redundancy in this movie, but it didn't bother me at all.

""The Next Level"" in the title actually describes the next level of unnecessary scenes and unfunny, mediocre jokes that add no meaning or weight to the overall plot of the story. The action scene is dull, the CGI is bad, the tension is absent, the pace is too slow, the drama is too shallow, and our heroes' (and heroine's) journey from the beginning until the very end of the third act falls flat. In summary, this is the worst installment of the entire franchise, so far.

In fact I loved it!The characters get sucked into the computer game and have to do some challenges to get a thing and shout ""Jumanji!"" - you know the drill.
This time instead of the tension coming from the ""Breakfast Club"" teen angst angle it comes from generational gaps and the inability to let go of long held grudges.Now don't get me wrong there is nothing particularly new here and some of the sheen has rubbed off since the first movie - we are no longer playing with a new toy here - but it is still very enjoyable.There are lame jokes and action scenes and new characters and fantasy landscapes.
Sure it is just people jumping around the place most of the time but it somehow managed to tap into that sense of adventure that much older films seemed to do so effortlessly.
Watching this did give me a sense of when I was a child and horizons were much further away than they are now.Great family fun!

I though it wasn't going to be as good as Welcome To The Jungle and maybe flop. But thankfully I was wrong for the most part at least. The Next Level is a fun, adventurous sequel that throws in new elements to mix things up a bit. And it's emotional beats are there and are sometimes even better then the first. And that mostly due to the actors delivery. Speaking of the which the cast is pitch perfect again just like the first movie. When I was the Rock and Kevin Hart I couldn't help but think of them as Danny DeVito and Danny Glover because their delivery. The action and the effects are also just as good if not better then the first. I love how the villain was played by the Hound from GOT. Even though he was underdeveloped I still felt like he was more developed then the villain in the last movie. I also loved how Alex came back and helped them that was really wholesome. There are some scenes in this movie that feel Ike they drag on for a bit longer then they should and the pace isn't as tight as the first movie, but The Next Level still offers a fun movie with humor and heart.

The Rock's impersonation of Danny Devito was to look like a moron with his mouth hanging open; the other one spoke in a slow witless drawl. While oldsters might not know the specific game being played, we DO play video games and understand the concept and don't need the basics explained over and over. Heck - we INVENTED video games. I'm wondering how funny people would think this movie was if they were ridiculing other races, other religions, other genders - along with ridiculing people because of their ages.

Kevin Hart's comedic talent was wasted on him being based on Danny Glover (booooring.....). The Rock was similarly not as funny, as his portrayal of Danny Devito was a stretch (enough of the the New York accent already!). Jack Black played the straight (serious) man, which again, is a waste of his talent. He is too funny to waste in that role. The rest of the characters were good.

Using words like God**mn and Jesus Christ, not only used often and in an offensive derogatory way it was used as if it was acceptable everyday language. Heartbroken and beyond angry that the writers sunk so low and disappointed that the original cast would want to see their movie brought down to such a subpar level.

The result is that Dwayne Johnson is lots of fun as a cantankerous old man, Kevin Hart is utterly amazing as a loquacious old man, and Awkwafina is very funny as two very different people.Once again, the lovely Karen Gillan is overshadowed, but that's not entirely her fault. Unlike the other actors, she only plays one character, and it's a particularly bland character. Jack Black is also underwhelming in a new role but improves markedly when he gets to play his role from the first film.Anyway, the story is entertaining, the new characters are hilarious, I love Awkwafina, Gillan is very hot, and all-in-all I found this tremendously entertaining.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The quality of the movies is constant so if you liked the first or the second movie you will probably like this one as well. I always have a lot of pleasure watching any of the Jumanji movies. There is that right amount of humor mixed with adventure. The CGI's are well done, giving the movie an extra little thing that adds to the adventurous feeling when your watching Jumanji. The cast is like usual very good in Jumanji. Every character and actor adds something special to the plot. I'm normally not a fan at all of The Rock but in Jumanji Dwayne Johnson is actually funny to watch. And even if the story is basically the same in all Jumanji movies it's still entertaining, that says enough about the quality of these movies. I'm not done with Jumanji, I could watch another one.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

In this movie the rock intimidates Danny deVito very poorly, every time when the rock intimidates him, I was very annoyed. Also the third act started kinda poor but starts building up very well, I also thought the first and second acts was done amazing.

I felt like the writers just had a blast creating the story because they were able to enhance the personality of veterans and newcomers of the franchise through the reality and in the game itself especially with Spencer's grandfather and his friend who honestly had the best relationship in the film. Though there are some scenes and jokes that do drag on, most of the comedy and thrilling action more than make up for it especially with that quite touching ending. Plus, I love that the film allowed the plot to expand on more worlds and regions with new abilities/obstacles instead of rehashing the same ones again. I highly suggest you watch it this holiday season if at any other reason to watch Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart act like two old men which was actually quite convincing.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I Enjoyed that film as well but to be honest this one is way more funnier and entertaining. Some added characters worked like charm. Dwyane Johnson and Kevin Hart just stole the show with their electric chemistry here. Jack Black too was top on his game with Karen providing the necessary balance in the plot.
The performances are surely the highlight of it. Though I really wanted to see more from the 'Actual' real life versions of themselves. I find them a tad weaker here in comparison with the previous film. There's gotta be some applause for Smart Writing as well. The screenplay is well crafted with fast pacing and enthralling sequences. Although it became a bit predictable after a certain point but it never bored nor became tiring. As there is something in every scene whatsoever; whether it's action or comedy stuff. You get something in every sequence to cheer you up. A well directed and executed movie that should have a little bit more character depth and some twists in my opinion to Bring out the best in it. Nevertheless a High Recommendation for Mainstream Adventure movie lovers. Grab your seatbelts and just enjoy the fun ride. Don't think much. As this was only supposed to give you laughter and joy and it certainly succeeded on that front.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is a direct sequel to the 2017 Jumanji:Welcome to the Jungle and third in the series, counting the original from 1995. This movie is fast paced, humorous and entertaining. There are several cameos such as Danny DeVito, Danny Glover and Awkwafina that are very good-Nick Jonas & Colin Hanks return as well, and there is a surprise cameo from the 1995 original movie. There is a twist here; the body occupations are switched. Dwayne is occupied by Danny DeVito, Jack by different teens and Kevin by Danny Glover. Karen has some funny inhabitants, too. This one also has more diverse settings than just the jungle, including snowy mountains and treeless deserts. The ending is a hint for a sequel and there is a scene right after the end credits start that ties in with the original 1995 movie. It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, language and some suggestive material and has a running time of 2 hours & 3 minutes. If you liked the last one, then you should enjoy this one, too. It's a real game changer that I would buy on Blu-Ray.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Even though some of the ""awe"" is gone from the first, they did many of things to bring some new awe. Alot of twists too. If you seen the trailers, there is alot they aren't showing you that you will not expect.The cast did a great job with their spot on imperinations of who they were supposed to be. The comedy was great and there was never really any flopped jokes. Though if you haven't seen the first, you may not get many of the jokes. And for gamers there are things they do that make you say ""Yep, thats a video game for you!"".I have no real complaints. I'd only say if you have little kids, there are some animals that may be scary to them. In one scene a man is feeding some hyenas small pieces of meat. At which point he says the meat is the hyenas trainer.

AAA quality as always with everything from vfx, cgi, stunt co coordinating, and shots. Really great job done by everyone which is apparent by the budget.Story:
You will see a lot of reviews about this saying its better than the previous film, well it is. This had imo a better plot, acting, comedy, villain, cast, and story. It's interesting all the way through all being said it is very cheesy, goofy and many things are predictable. There are a lot of coincidences and good timing for the sake of plot direction.

It had the potential to be an excellent movie. The action, the story plot, the humor, the actors and actresses, everything was there, but one thing killed this movie. The language was terrible. For a Christian, it was extremely offensive. GD was used so much, it was ridiculous, but not just that one. The language was uncalled for. It was terrible! My husband and I was disgusted, and I would highly recommend anyone with a smidgen of conscious to skip this movie. If you have younger children, it's a definite no.
My suggestion, if they decide to come out with a third movie is clean those filthy mouths. Consider your audience and young viewers. Would you be that filthy toward a Muslim or Buddhist, and disrespect their gods? No.
Then please use that same consideration to the Christian viewers. Whether you support our values or convictions or not, you're still putting our money in your pocket when we're viewing your movies. Realize this too, when we watch you in this movie, and see you use this kind of profanity toward our God, it's really hard to support you as actors and actresses in other movies.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I can see it as an entertaining movie for children, but certainly not one for the whole family. It never should have been made into a franchise.

This movie is not only adventures but it tell us too much about the important lesson of life that is ""life is precious and it has It's up and downs but you bare lucky to have one son l8ve like its only time you have"". Enjoy friendship and value your friends buz they will help you everytime.it show how friends play a vital role in our life and it give lession that how we survive in certical situation. I don't want to give spoiler but I love the scene where martha said to spencer that with you I am free I don't need to show off I can be who I am. We all must have a person like that in our life. Too much messages are there. About the movie the level of danger is more than previous part. The character of villain is less than previous jumanji but its a great acting . The riddles are easy too. There are new levls new adventure. Two new playing character and so many new strength for old characters. I am a big fan of adventure movies and I always watch a movie like a kid. The kid inside me felt awesome and joyful while watching this movie. I am waiting for the next installment of the franchise. This is great all the character were to the point. Chemistry of kevin hart and the rock is always great. All n all go and watch the movie with any one friends family boyfriend , girlfriend ex , in-laws or even enemy.

The same characters, with the same personable actors (plus a twist), in the same setting, doing the same things, while calling out that they're doing the same things.But then the casters and writers, having nothing to do, decided that they'd spice it up a bit by injecting some absolutely breathtaking racism.First, the character of Fridge declares that he ""don't know why he hang around with White people"", as though the situation unfolding is the fault of the White race. He then declares horror and disgust at being given a White avatar.Flip that around. Imagine any White person put into a black body and saying ""At least last time I was still White"".This is not OK. It's not OK to write, or to say, or to stand on the set and take the paycheck for shutting up.Then they cast Nora Lum, most famous for her audio-blackface ebonics. I'll go ahead and laugh at that, because I'm just a ignant White boy, but I'm astonished that black people haven't long since cancelled her.Credit where it's due, Kevin Hart does a superb Danny Glover, and the rest of the headline cast (Lum aside) are solid enough. That's the shame of it, they could have made a fun movie here if they hadn't poisoned it up front with toxic, festering and overt racial hatred.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The trailers were on point and the first film was such a nice surprise, so I had high expectations for Jumanji: The Next Level.
SYNOPSIS:
It's been a couple years since Spencer (Alex Wolff), Fridge (Ser'Darius Blain), Martha (Morgan Turner) and Bethany (Madison Iseman) succeeded in their quest through Jumanji. Spencer, going through a tough time with school and his relationship with the crew, causes him to explore the realms of Jumanji again and the crew now has to go back in to save him.DIRECTION:
The same exact direction as you saw in the first film. I have no problem here and the direction does still allow this film to hold my attention until some point through the third act at which point I was checking out.WRITING:
The majority of the problems I have with this film are right here in the script. It's already a tough task to make essentially the same film while still adding enough to not feel entirely similar. After seeing the trailer, I was excited to see The Rock playing Danny DeVito and Kevin Hart playing Danny Glover, but one of the big problems to me was the dialogue for both of them. The film constantly plays with the fact that Glover and DeVito don't realize they're in a video game. It was funny for the first act and then a little into the second act, but I was sitting there wondering ""when are they going to stop acting like they still don't remember they're in a video game."" I understand if this were to be a real situation that it would be hard to believe, but they didn't play it like it was hard to believe, but that they didn't understand and then they understood and then they didn't understand and then they understood (no, I didn't accidentally repeat that twice, that's just how they were portrayed in the film). Maybe I'm nit-picking, but at some point I want the writing to make a decision on whether they want the characters to understand or not. Another issue I had was a similar issue I had with the first film. An underused villain. I get that adventure is the big picture of the film, but when you barely build up a villain, I feel no real threat when the crew and the villain meet face-to-face. Lastly, I won't give it away, but there was a decision made in the writing at the end of the film that I borderline despised. I know that's not true criticism, but I spent my whole drive home and a couple hours into this Chicago Bulls game trying to think of a way to explain it without spoiling it. So, if you really want to know then DM on here (if that's even a thing) or on my IG @YourGuyJYACTING:
I'll start with saying that The Rock wasn't great as Danny DeVito. I would say sub-par, however, he's charming enough on screen where I started to not notice as much. I think Jack Black and Karen Gillan were great just like from the first film. Now onto the bread and butter and that is Kevin Hart and Awkwafina. Kevin Hart is so good at playing Danny Glover that I almost wish he stayed playing Danny Glover in every role he's in. To me he really saved this film and kept it fresh enough to keep me entertained. Then in comes Awkwafina hot off her performance in The Farewell into a much more exciting role. I loved her in Crazy Rich Asians and I liked her in The Farewell (even though I wasn't a fan of the film) and I loved her in this. ESPECIALLY, when there's a certain switch to her character. She KILLED it from that point and I really can't wait to see what she does next.CONCLUSION:
This film was good enough from start to finish that I wouldn't say it's not for anyone. I feel this film will be less enjoyable to adults than it will be for kids (which this film is more catered towards) as it does feel very repetitive throughout the film. It was also good enough where I would recommend you do see it, just when it comes out on DVD so you can see Kevin Hart's and Awkwafina's performances.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I expected the same formula in the 2nd installation, and I got a much worse version. The Rock and Kevin Hart play characters whom are inhabited by elderly folks, and they flat line it. It turns out that The Rock can only play himself. I genuinely cringed 2 or 3 times at some of his accents. I had just told a friend before I went that the nice thing about movies starring Dwayne Johnson is that they are never awful. Never amazing, but never awful. This movie was about as close to awful as big budget gets.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

So Jumanji : the next level is directed by Joe kaplan and stars everyone from the first one along with Danny devito as Spencer's grandpa. So Spencer for some reason goes back into the game and the gang go back in as well , to save him ofc. Only this time , Spencer's grandpa and his friend also get stuck . Unlike last time they don't get to choose their avatars and so fridge becomes Jack black , Devito's friend becomes Kevin Hart and Devito himself becomes the Rock ! , All these actors trying to imitate another one , especially Jack Black as Fridge was hilarious and made place for a lot of running gags and one liners which landed.in the end , Jumanji the next level is fun , adrenaline fueled and has the best cue and montage for "" welcome to the jungle "" by gun's and roses.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Briefly: the full package for a friday escape with the girls. Assuming you're the girls I'd like to know.Not only is every actor vivid, it's a lot easier to appreciate the talent they bring to the role since most of them are effectively playing double roles. It is quite darling to see the Rock try to be Danny Devito and although he could be more convincing in that capacity, he tries so dang hard it's fun to watch.Later the one called ""Awfafina"" plays the same character. I only know her from Angry Birds 2 and the IMDB clickbait but I was quite impressed.In addition to all of this, there were moments I did actually find profoundly moving.My one real criticism is there is a pretty weak reason to get them back in the game. Yes, they go in after one of their own but his motivations feel very abstract and the soft pedalled relationship drama that forms a half-hearted C-plot is not what anyone came to see.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Jumanji: The Next Level - Jake Kasdan Directs A Hugely Entertaining Sequel With Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Jack Black, Kevin Hart, Danny de Vito, Nick Jonas & Awkwafina","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5378543/?ref_=tt_urv","helenbassett","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur101877629/?ref_=tt_urv","3 January 2020","I was really looking forward to see how the new Jumani cast would work with the original cast members, and it was a total blast. Director Jake Kasdan seamlessly wove Danny de Vito, Awkwafina and Danny Glover into Jumanji: The Next Level, each bringing their own skills to the gaming world.Our original four high school kids are now Freshmen at College, and some handling it better than others. Alex Wolff's Spencer is still the nerd of The Breakfast Club crew, and coming home for Christmas he gets to share his bedroom with Grandpa, played by Danny de Vito, and convalescing after a hip operation. Fun! And Spencer is in no rush to meet up with his pals from detention. He just misses being Dr Bravestone. Do we blame him? Of course not, who wouldn't miss being Dwayne Johnson. Have you seen him? But the kids broke the game up at the end of the last Jumanji.And when Spencer doesn't arrive his pals come to find him. Ser'Darius Blain again plays Fridge the athlete, Madison Iseman's Bethany is still loving her phone and Morgan Turner's Martha is still loving Spencer, but they never seem to connect anymore. In real life anyway. And when they turn up at Spencer's house they also meet Grandpa Eddie and his friend Milo played by Danny Glover. The old timers have some unfinished business from a long time ago. But the kids are more interested in finding Spencer. And guess where he is.But with a broken game the characters aren't playing correctly, and we have extra unexpected avatars. Who are more than a little surprised themselves. This could take some getting used to! As a sequel the film more than lives up to its predecessor, with Danny de Vito and Awkwafina excelling as Dr Bravestone and Ming Fleetfoot. Although not always in the right order. The avatars we met in the first movie including Karen Gillan's Ruby Roundhouse, she's still awesome, terrific Kevin Hart's Mouse Finbar and Jack Black's Shelly Oberon are back again for the desert adventure. Casting for both films was incredible. They all work so well together. And Bethany has a whole new sleek body to discover. As well as no phone. Again. But Nick Jonas's Jefferson Seaplane is still in one piece. Thankfully.And of course Jumanji is again in great danger, this time from the marauding Jurgen the Brutal, played by Rory McCann. And with new skills and weaknesses our players must do what they do best to save Spencer and Jumanji. And it's terrifically funny. I cannot say I'm a fan of gaming but Jumanji is one hell of a ride, with the new wilder levels and fiercer CGI animals. Some of whom even escape out of the broken cartridge box. But that's a whole other level.With vivid cinematography by Gyula Pados, new desert vistas and snow covered mountain peaks to climb, the prospect of death always hangs over our avatars, with their three lives and counting. And we get through them pretty rapidly just explaining the game. But lives in Jumanji live on, so fly, fly, and maybe see you next time.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Really good film all round. 10 out of 10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Thats right...this is not a sequel, its reboot of the last Jumanji movie..And it shamelessly has the exact same cast. And the same story..and the characters relearn the same lessons...how boringI guess this is technically a movie. Its long enough and stuff happens...But there is literally no story. Just several random skits loosely tied together by...ummm...hmmm...the same characters...but not really?Ok you don't introduce water that can change bodies to just to cover up the fact that for some reason the director told The Rock to do this whiny girls voice...Who is he supposed to be sounding like? None of the other characters ever..>EVER have or had an accent..so why him..why now? And if you are going to use it then why change it halfway through? Did they change directors halfway through? How was the water supposed to deter people from getting the Jumanji berry?How did they fix the game? If the game only had 4 characters availabe at the start why are there now 6 characters. Why is the boy the same character?And strangest, the funniest part of the movie is the animators trying to hide the fact that this horse has no wings..yeah they never actually show the wings lol","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

And taking them into a whole new adventure with a few new twists with the characters. If you love the second movie Welcome to the Jungle. You will love this movie which takes the characters in new adventures and exciting action set pieces. The fun humor.The plot follows Spencer (Alex Wolff) who is feeling distant with his friends Fridge (Ser Darius Blain), Martha (Morgan Turner), and Bethany (Madison Iseman). Spencer now has his grandfather Eddie (Danny DeVito) living with them. Which Eddie friend Milo (Danny Glover) comes to visit. When Spencer brings back the game Jumanji ands pulled in. His friends try to search for him and gets back into the game. The twist is Eddie and Milo are also pulled in and are disguised as Bravestone (Dwayne Johnson), and Mouse (Kevin Hart). While Fridge is now Shelly (Jack Black) and Martha is still Ruby (Karen Gillan). The new adventure of Jumanji is to search for the stolen gem that is captured by a group of bad guys.The plot is similar to the first movie with new twist. Which the twists makes it a lot of fun. Seeing Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart's interpretation as Danny Glover and Danny DeVito. Fresh faces, fresh humor, and a lot of action sequences. From some crazy dune chase sequence with the characters being chased by a herd of ostriches. To a swinging walkaway bridges with characters being chased by monkeys. And a showdown fight scene with Karen Gillan and Dwayne Johnson fighting through an army of guys. It is not short on the action.I love the cast ensemble. Dwayne, Karen, Jack, and Kevin are all fun and great. I would love to see another adventure with them. Nick Jonas makes an appearance which is fun. New additions like Awkwafina, Danny DeVito, and Danny Glover brings some fun fresh energy into the movie as well.The plot may be nothing new to the series. Which is similar to the second movie. But it sure as well is a lot of fun with the cast, humor, and action.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Me because I was hoping for it to be good since the last Jumanji that came out in 2017 witch I thought was a pretty solid comedy and remake this movie did have some funny scenes like jack black in all of them he was my favourite part of the movie to be honest Kevin Hart was funny too but The Rocks Danny DeVito impression got old after a few minutes and it was starting to annoy me same thing when they switched and that girl was Danny DeVito also same as last time the villain was stupid but to be fare this is better then most reboots that come out it was probably a 7 in the first half but that just dropped during the
second half of the movie it just got boring but the action scenes were r

Liked the characters and the story was pretty ok. But this movie, was the icing on cake. This movie was way more funny than the first film and had a better story in my opinion. The acting was very well done, from Dwayne Johnson having to act like Danny Devito and also Awkwafina having to do the same thing. There really isn't much to say about the score cause there wasn't a whole lot of memorable tunes. But the pacing in my opinion was very well crafted. This movie was a surprise to me cause it was so funny and entertaining. Definitely would recommend this to anyone.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Good fun.'The Next Level' is more of the same. Also fairly good fun but now the novelty has worn off.

I had such an appreciation for how that movie was done which is important when I say that I love these 2 new jumanji's even more. I think the way they went about the whole game and how the characters took the form of developed characters inside jumanji was an ingenious portrayal. Even more so in the second movie, it allows for a certain level of comedic relief which is what this franchise was built on. I think the 6.7 or 6.9 ratings are seriously low for such a well put together movie which is why I consider the new films to be massively underrated. The two new jumanji movies are a MUST WATCH and you are missing out on a great piece of pop culture if you refuse to do so.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I haven't laughed that hard watching a movie in a long time, since I don't find a lot of comedy films to be all that humorous. This was so much better than the first one. In fact, the first film was boring. Sequels are usually bad, but Jumanji: The Next Level was unique. You can tell the writers put in a lot of effort compared to the previous film. Watching The Rock and Kevin Hart act like old men was hilarious. I loved how it was a mixture of different themes. The background setting was like a combination of science fiction and Game of Thrones. This movie was proof that sexual banter and toilet humor aren't needed to create laughter. The jokes were actually clever for a change. There were also some heartwarming moments and valuable lessons. I guess you can't watch this without watching the first one beforehand, but just as a warning: you will be bored out of your mind with the first movie. You will definitely enjoy this one!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A ""Game"" cast brings the fun in a sequel as good as the original","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5320511/?ref_=tt_urv","bankofmarquis","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur10919398/?ref_=tt_urv","14 December 2019","Did you enjoy the previous JUMANJI film where Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan were video game avatars of 4 teens sucked into a video game? It was alot of fun, an unexpected big hit and, inevitably, spun a sequel.Well...if you liked the last one, then you'll like this one, for JUMANJI: THE NEXT LEVEL pretty much delivers the same type of fun film, but avoids the cliches and lack of energy that a ""quickie"" sequel inevitably delivers.Credit for this should go to returning Director Jake Kasdan and a ""game"" cast that are ALL back from the previous film. While the plot is fairly similar (4 teens are sucked into a real-life video game where they can be trapped forever if they cannot ""win"" the game), the twist of adding 2 old folks (played in the real world by Danny Glover and Danny DeVito) almost derails the fun, but this winning cast and passably exciting action sequences steers this film into an enjoyable entertainment activity.I am a big Kevin Hart fan - and he does a great job of channeling Danny Glover in his character. He really brought the charm - and the funny - from the get go. He is ably assisted by Karen Gillan, who doesn't really have anything new to do, but brings the same ""kick-butt action with a wink in the eye"" characterization and energy as the first film. The surprise for me was Jack Black who I thought was very, very funny and energized. If anything, I thought his characterization was BETTER than the previous film. Only ""The Rock"" fails to equal his previous efforts - and he is just fine (he is ""The Rock"" after all). When you are talking about a team of actors playing against each other in an action/comedy and ""The Rock"" is the weak link, then you are in good shape.A fine addition to the proceedings is the always watchable Awkwafina as another character in the game while Nick Jonas returns as the avatar Alex and Rory McCann (the Hound in GAME OF THRONES) is very fun as the ""big bad"" in this film.The action scenes are fun, the characters are enjoyable to spend 2 hours with and the puzzle that they are trying to solve is clever (enough) that you will be able to pass a few enjoyable hours with your family this Holiday season.Letter Grade: B+8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The VERDICT:Overall, Jumanji's return was a very entertaining and decently balanced film. It somehow manages to make the familiar, same adventure we have known be fresh, with well written lines and humor to keep you engrossed in the film. For such a brisk pace, it manages to keep things well juggled, finding a nice medium between story, action, and comedy that it should be entertaining for most audiences. And with this cast that you get, well you will not be disappointed to see how well utilized most of the group is, something I can't brag about enough in this modern era of unbalanced delivery. Still, the film fails at the end to really capitalize on the story telling components, and has not quite achieved the full integration effect for me that I hope to see, especially given the weaker antagonist. Looking at this though, the movie is definitely worth a check out and I hope you guys give a theater visit given all the special effects and humor.A WORD OF CAUTION, if you are thinking of taking younger audience members be warned there is lots of strong language that little ears may repeat. Take note of that before planning.My scoresAdventure/Action/Comedy: 8.0

That they believed the world wanted a new take on the classic Robin William's starring family film with boardgames being turned into video games? There was no way surely that the new Jumanji would be any good.Well almost a billion dollars at the world wide box office later and solid reviews from critics and audiences alike proved us all wrong, as director Jake Kasdan and his all-star cast showed that a whole new world of Jumanji wasn't actually that bad of an idea.As is the case with anything so successful, Jumanji didn't lay dormant for long as it gets the core gang of Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Karen Gillan and Kevin Hart back once more for a return to the world of a dangerous interactive game, but this time there's far less surprises in store as Kasdan and his team mostly re-heat what they produced in the 2017 outing.With expectations so low the first time around, audiences found themselves surprised by the amount of solid laughs and cast chemistry that was found in Welcome to the Jungle but The Next Level can't find that same style of unexpected delights, even if it swaps up avatars between our players and introduces geriatrics Danny Glover and Danny DeVito to this new adventure.Everything that takes place in Next Level is fairly predictable and slight, with Kasdan and his cast unable to conjure up the same unexpected magic they did first time around even if the films bigger budget and more large-scale spectacle will keep viewers interested and the tween audience glued to the screen throughout.With the same setup of the gang having to battle a dastardly NPC and save the kingdom, it makes it harder for all the banter and character beats to shine through even if all performers are clearly having another bout of good times, with Johnson and Hart having the most fun doing their best impressions of DeVito and Glover.It feels as though now the new financially viable series is in a place where further installments will have to push the boundaries narratively quite a bit further should it want to remain relative, as while its fooled us all once and to a lesser extent twice, a third time would be a bridge too far for a franchise that has become one of the most surprisingly popular of the modern era.Final Say -Still watchable and instilled with fun performances, Jumanji: The Next Level cant hide the fact its story and jokes have quickly started to feel a little stale, with a fresh approach needed when the next installment hits.2 1/2 pollen weaknesses out of 5","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The gang is back together again, everyone is home from college for Christmas break and are suppose to meet up for brunch, but when Spencer is a no show, it sparks the gang's curiosity to go and find him since not returning anyone's texts or calls.
Spencer has some insecurities and is feeling blue, he and his girlfriend or on a break, which causes him to return to the game. This time, they've added a couple of new guests, which formulates an even better team that makes this movie even more humorous.
The environment turns out to be different in the game along with the storyline, and also makes this film more interesting.
If your a Dwayne Johnson or Kevin Hart fans, you're in for a treat watching this film, you'll be introduced, to the two new Dannys.
Danny Glover and Danny Devito, they make this film even more hilarious.
Make sure you have stitches available, you may bust a gut. I give this film two Thumbs up.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There's a reason this movie's rating is so close to the ""Welcome to the Jungle"". It's just as good, in the best way possible.I mean, sure, you have an occasional success story where a first film is good, and the second is just far and away better (seemingly 99% of which are solely thanks to James Cameron), but mostly what we want from a sequel is a return to the same positive experience we had before, and this movie delivers beautifully. I laughed just as much, loved every character, found just as many new videogame in-jokes to admire. There was just enough of a twist on the plot to keep it fresh, yet still in touch with the first movie, and the same can be said for all the new characters--it all fit right into place.This could easily have been called Jumanji: Vol. 2. If you liked WttJ you'll like TNL just as much, for all the same reasons.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Because there was enough in both film and video games (in the 90s) to criticize and to put in as a jokeOne-dimensional characters, villains whit exaggerated plans, badly rimmed graphics, animals moving in circles instead of having a real AI. Or the stereotypes of foreigners.But no puff cake, the whole film is so empty and not saying as if you had taken 20 steps back. Everyone in the film is super annoying and super unpleasant, so I kept shouting ""shut up"" every 3 minutes.
Everyone is telling the same jokes for almost an hour and a half, really, again and again.
And I can't decide until the end of the film who's going to poke me more Danny DeVito or The Rock. What is Grandpa Eddi because has he Alzheimer? Is he demented? Is he stupid? Do you just pretend? What is he?
At the end of the film they try to be really emotional and pseudo-philosophically too late.
Also in this film I had no impression that what was at stake nor that the characters were really in danger
but when Danny DeVito said growing old wasn't hell, I got the cold vomit.
Movies should finally stop lying. sometimes the glass is half full and sometimes half empty but you shouldn't lie about the liquid in it.But what I think is the worst thing is that the film made nothing of its premise. A lot of bad second parts have that they restore the status quo from part 1 and tell the same story again here it would have actually made sense and I also find it interesting that Spencer voluntarily goes to video games to be back in paradise but then it became Idea didn't finish and that's the worst. The film is a knock knock joke without a punchlineThe bottom line is still a competence because film and he uses some film tricks but nothing really irritated me objectively, I give the film 3 out of 10 points, subjectively I give it a middle finger.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Too late! That was the first thing I did.In recent years, the terms ""Remake"" and ""Reboot"" have become very popular in Hollywood. Much to my annoyance. In most cases, these knockoffs are just a shadow of the original. Not to say abominably bad and horrible to look at. The biggest example of this (for me personally anyway) is the movie ""Ghostbusters"" from 2016. If Bill Murray was no longer among the living, he would have turned around in his grave. A needless copy without humor and full of recycled ideas. A few years ago when I was told that a remake was being made of the famous film ""Jumanji"" (with the unparalleled Robin Williams in a leading role) from 1995, I was shocked. And certainly when it turned out that Dwayne Johnson hijacked the leading role. Yet another redundant and ridiculous attempt to imitate a past milestone.To my surprise, however, ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle"" turned out to be an exceptionally successful experiment. And that's because of the unique idea to replace the ""Jumanji board game"" with an old skool console game where four innocent students are teleported into and where they need to complete a quest while playing a character in this game. It's the only way to escape the game. Not only was it a funny movie (due to the interactions and personality contradictions between the real youngsters and their avatar in the video game). The concept was also original. Adding video game features such as NPCs, cut scenes, and the fact that each character has a limited number of lives, was a masterful move. It's not without reason that the film was a real success in the theaters. And the inevitable happened. The sequel ""Jumanji: The next level"" is a fact.Unfortunately, as I feared, this new sequel doesn't take the saga to a new level. To be honest, I thought it was simply an uninspired story that simply tries to take advantage of the previous film's success. An easy solution to squeeze the last dollars out of a milked-out project. The novelties can be counted on a broken abacus. Not many, in this case. The characters are all still the same. This time supplemented with two old grumpy retirees (Danny DeVito and Danny Glover) who used to be business partners when they owned a thriving restaurant. As with every new level in a video game, the environment in which the adventure takes place is different from the previous level. So you'll be presented with a sandy location with associated oases. And also, our friends will encounter a completely different fauna on their path.The most successful aspect of this sequel is the fact that the different characters were initially mixed. That makes for hilarious moments when you see Dwayne Johnson imitating the characteristics of a Dany DeVito. But besides that, there's nothing innovative to discover in this sequel. It's a well-known story with a new look. It's the same as when a new ""FIFA Soccer"" version is being released on the game market. Graphically it may look a bit sharper and some new players and options have been added. But otherwise, the look and feel are similar and you have trouble discovering the points of improvement. Well, ""Jumanji: The Next Level"" was entertaining and packed with sometimes masterful CGI. A good alternative to fill a pleasant movie night. But the source from which creative ideas are created is exhausted. Let's hope they bury the game ""Jumanji"" in a well-hidden spot once and for all, so nobody can lay their hands on it again. I think we've had enough of this.More reviews here: movie-freak.be","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It was a bit slow and I couldn't really see where they were going to start with, but once they all landed in Jumanji it was incredibly funny.I thought that Kevin Hart was superb in this one as Danny Glover's character Milo.Jack Black does a superb job as ""Fridge"" and as ""Bethany"". While the newest addition, Awkwafina as Ming made a fantastic Danny DeVito as Eddie, but didn't wow me as Spencer.If you want that to make sense you'll have to watch it. It's a shame that 'The Rock's' character doesn't lend itself too well to being the person who's playing as his avatar, because he has to be like a superhero from the start, but he doesn't do a bad job.It also brilliantly shows the generational gap between Grandparents and the youth of today. Sometimes it's a real struggle to explain everything, repeatedly.This franchise is so open to go on for ages with the right scripts. I hope they don't ruin it by rushing our film after film just to make money and that they invest in the stories as much as the gimmick.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There does not seem to be sufficient introduction to its main plot device of Jumanji, which means that you have to have watched the first movie to understand what's going on. A lot of the themes explored in the sequel also require you to remember what happened in the first movie. I feel like there is an unwritten between movie makers and movie goers that this is not ok. Every movie should be a standalone thing.2. The last 40 minutes of the film goes downhill. It's like a different team took over the movie and wasn't sure what the first team wanted and didn't have the vision that the first team had. It all just sort of ends, and the interesting themes that were introduced in the first half, don't get a satisfactory resolution in the 2nd half.Having said that, this movie is still pretty great. I watched it back to back with Red Notice, another Dwayne Johnson vehicle, and the first 5 minutes of Jumanji had more acting talent and interesting material, than the entirety of Red Notice.One of the main interesting things about the first film is that the 4 main actors were playing against type. In the 2nd film, the story makes them do that twice. They play one set of characters and then switch to a different set half way through the movie. This was so entertaining to watch.There are a few interesting emotional themes at play. The main theme does unfortunately require the watching of the first movie for full appreciation, but oh well.Also great to see Danny Glover and Danny DeVito. They are not phoning it in, like so many other old actors nowadays do.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I wish we'd have had more of Aquafina and Nick Jonas.A lot of the rules of the game this time round make less sense than the first movie but it doesn't matter because it's still a lot of fun.Don't forget to watch for the extra scene in the credits!

In its 1 hour 55 minute runtime, it never runs of out steam. There are some laugh out loud moments in the movie, but in general, the movie is amusing and will definitely bring a smile to your face.All the actors have done a incredible job in the movie, especially in the body shifting scenes. The players in the game have actually done a pretty good job at embodying the teenagers and the elders. This must have required a great deal of skill. Kevin Hart and Jack Black steal the show in this regard.The special effects in the movie are also pretty decent as well. The ostrich chase scene is the example of that.The story is also coherent. It is simple and ties all parts of the story. It is not like Nolan's movies and it should not even be. The story is befitting to the movie.Overall, it can be watched as a wholesome family entertainer.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The sequel from 2017 is not good but the 2019 sequel is slightly better than it. This film has basically the same plot as the original although it does differentiate in a few places but its repetitiveness leads the film to be predictable. I was able to predict what was going to happen before each ""level"". Since I felt it was predictable, I did get bored during some sequences. The film has a noticeable lack of tension due to its repetitiveness and predictability. I knew the characters would be fine and make it out of each situation okay. The script is nothing too good either. It isn't terrible but I felt it lacked a little bit of charm and caused some of the jokes to feel a little forced although a handful of jokes got a smile or chuckle out of me. The video game characters played by Dwayne Johnson, Karen Gillan, Jack Black, and Kevin Hart did a pretty good job. In the first film, they had to impersonate only one character but in this film they had to impersonate two or three and I felt they did a great job at that. In the first film, I felt Jack Black was the only funny character but in this one Jack Black and Kevin Hart were the funniest ones. Gillan and Johnson were able to get a laugh out of me though in a couple of areas. Unfortunately, the acting from the real life characters, besides Danny DeVito and Danny Glover, was not so great. They do not have any chemistry together and just felt awkward around each other. The action set pieces are new and unique in some areas but similar and repetitive in others. They were entertaining yet a little boring at the same time. Some of the technical aspects are just okay. The music is bland and boring but the cinematography is serviceable. The visual effects were mostly below average in the first one but they were better here although very shotty in a few areas. Overall, Jumanji: The Next Level is dumb popcorn fun with good acting and chemistry from the video game characters but its predictability, repetitveness, and lack of tension takes away from the film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Bland, generic villains, no opportunity for some really clever video game jokes, and nothing to prove warranting further movies. As amazing as it is, it's slightly better than Welcome to the Jungle, but that's only because of the antics of Danny Glover and Danny DeVito. Kevin Hart is funnier impersonating Glover and Dwayne Johnson is fun as DeVito. The movies lack the heart and soul of the original, and Sony can't make good movies anymore. Making a wacky video game movie is perfectly fine with me, but I don't know why they're doing it with Jumanji. The original is a fun action, adventure fantasy with great practical effects. It has some laughs, but it's no comedy by any stretch of the imagination. I miss the primordial jungle with giant spiders and man eating plants. They really need to get back to their roots. There are some fun video game moments, but there's not enough of them, and the ones we do get aren't strong enough to be clever or entertaining. If you've seen the trailer for Free Guy, that's a movie that's getting the video game stuff right. Wreck-It Ralph is also more entertaining for it's antics. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is the gold standard for video game movies, and Jumanji just can't get there.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So the dialog is written to keep audience in a happy place and without going deep into ""what and how"" the story unfolds with it's twists and turns almost flawlessly, so 2 hours pass with ease.
All the actors play nicely separated (physically and emotionally) characters and this alone makes this movie a good watch. It's a very borderline family show. Perhaps 12+ is the most suitable age as there are very general sexual references and mild language present.

I then saw Jumanji 2 on the TV (didn't wanna go to the cinema) and although totally different to 1 and not even close to the quality of that, I unexpectedly enjoyed it. They didn't try to mess with the original and they did their own take on the film; a simple, family-friendly, easy-fun one. That said, Jumanji 3 is pretty mediocre and makes me conclude that it was unfortunately a mere result of the huge box office of Jumanji 2. Three things to sum up:1) They ruined any suspense I could have during the movie, because while watching it I realized they had - chronologically - put all the main scenes in the trailer. So, the whole time I knew what was coming up. Awful! (That said, I think the plot was pretty predictable anyways).2) they tried to make a funny movie for all ages, so half the time that a ""funny"" scene was coming up, I was just sitting there, feeling like I'm watching cheap stuff. The only thing that saved it was some likeable actors.and 3) regarding the acting, Awkwafina was not suitable for the part and I'm sorry for the meanness, but Nick Jonas was forgettable and Karen Gillan was replaceable - I don't understand what Gillan brings to the table and gets hired in such films, other than she can look sexy with good make-up.Overall, I kind of enjoyed my time in the theater, but the film is very forgettable. You get out of the cinema and you're like ""Hm, yeah, it was cute, I guess"".","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

There is also a tribute to Alan Parrish-I like this version of the expanded worldview or ""rules"" and is actually another introduction to youth movies. The ending may be predictable, but it does not obscure the smoothness of the overall plot and the tacit understanding among the actors","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Although there are many similar films, they have not yet reached the point of rotten streets.The subject matter is good, but it is a pity that both films are very ordinary.
The first one was at least entertaining, and the sequel is clearly not going to go on, forcing a lot of jokes that are not funny.
It's neither funny nor tear-jerking, and the only feeling is that this popcorn movie is duller than an art house movie.
It is not easy to make such an interesting subject matter so boring.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.
