I mean, I don't have to tell you, you know what it is. Another Sony ""masterpiece"" with a generic script based on a revenge plot. The humor was cringe-worthy, the action wasn't even that good (and poorly shot), the whole film looks like a rap video. The story makes zero sense and the ending is incredibly stupid and anticlimactic.Thanks for Michael Bay cameo though, and I guess the credit scene had Jerry Bruckheimer in it for some reason? Probably an inside joke.I never thought I'd say this, but damn I miss 90ties Michael Bay. If you have to milk these franchises, at least give him the directing spot so I can enjoy his slow-mo, non-CGI explosions, women objectification and American flags.","49 out of 69 found this helpful.

Its chief failing not the age of its key players but the fact they seem to be forever apologising, for the fact.There are men and women in their 50's in the force, so why all the lame jokes about grey hair, sagging physiques and more?Plus the need to drag on board secondary characters, apparently to carry the action side of this flick cause the lead characters are ""sooooo over the hill""?

However, this threequel manages to pack in more heart and maturity than its predecessors. Bad Boys for Life brings all of the explosive fun the series is known for, but takes the franchise in new and exciting directions by choosing to be more reflective in nature.","26 out of 46 found this helpful.

I looked into it a little closer.1st. Batch of the feebs mentioned that they were disappointed in the directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah (some even were bothered that the directors are both Muslim).2nd. Batch of the feebs were on about ""the movie focuses too much on Feminism"". Are you friggin' kiddin' me? The women were awesome in the movie .3rd. Batch of the feebs were all bots. Rating 1-star and adding few lines of nonsense (I counted 103 bot reviews).4th. Batch of the feebs were just human beings with bad taste.Here is what you need to know without:
1. The movie is well directed.
2. The story wasnt perfect, but what is?

Swearing and all that. But that aside and not even close to comparing this to the Lethal Weapon franchise, the next entry into the Bad Boys series is here. Many have been waiting for this for a long time. Not sure why that was (many speculations about that), but let's just enjoy that it is here.It also feels like both Martin and Will never left ... the roles. It feels like they are those guys. Maybe some parts of them do match to their personality, who knows? Having said that, the movie is quite predictable, but also quite fun overall. I cannot be mad at some of the flaws and the convinient timing of certain events. Nor the added relationships and backstories that might feel detached to a degree. If you can just watch it, without thinking too much, it'll be ok. But I reckon it is time to rewatch the first two movies again ... (4 Life though?

Bad boys for life is the third bad boy's movie. I would say that was a fun messy movie a symphony of violence and comedy. There was a lot of violence and I lounged a lot. There was a some stuff in the third act I'm not gonna say what happens with the third action sequence is where myself the most and then it went completely jumped the shark and I was like that was fun. The movie has lot of funny moments, there was a lot of part where I chuckled I didn't laugh all everything the movie laughs there's almond. Which is surprising because considering they have not been in Bad Boys since 2003 and Lawrence has not been too active for the past decade because of unfortunate family issue. This movie is better then other ones because it has a much more structured plot and better direction with were it wants to go. I do not want to give away too much detail with the plot. However, you are getting yourself into any action movie with gunfights, chases and explosions. However, that may not necessarily sound appealing. But it definitely feels better if you watch the first two movies to see what you're getting yourself into, but this could also be your first one and you'd still fit right in the movie. The director for Bad Boys 1 & 2 was Michael Bay. Who is known specifically for the extreme quick action movies. Now the new director duo, Bilall Fallah and Adil El Arbi brought back some of Michael Bay's craziness. Nevertheless, they also brought a new angle were the movie is not so one-dimensional anymore and they has some real life problems which Mike and Marcus have to overcome. This makes this movie so much more satisfying. Because it has been a 17 years wait. If you are going to watch this movie, I think the fact that you should not take this too seriously and only to watch just for enjoying it. Because thinking too much and maybe looking for plot holes will make your experience sour. The way the movie ended there might also have a fourth Bad Boys somewhere in the future. Both of the main characters are facing suffering with Marcus Brunette consider retiring from the police force after becoming a grandfather and decided to focus on his family but Mike Lowery quickly realizes he's not what he once was, and he might have to leave from the police force. They both feel vulnerable which definitely something that I wanted is in the past movies. Because nothing felt like a threat to them. Their relationship was in deep trouble because they were making their ways of impression that they have been doing throughout their whole lives. They all did exceptional work in their parts, but in the past movies having Will and Martin taking too much of the movie. Overall, if we're talking a good action movie with two great action stars with phenomenal chemistry. If you're a fun of this franchise oh boy I cannot wait for you all to see this goodness. I cannot wait to see what the response is and if you're not a fan this could win you over and It is my favorite movie of 2020.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

Maybe the earlier entries hold something dear to his heart and he wouldn't have allowed this to go off the rails.The biggest casualty is the riffing between the Lawrence and Smith, which practically rips the soul right out of the franchise. The laughs from the first two movies came from the strong chemistry between the two leads and how they could argue in the middle of gun fights, car chases, etc. Here they just sound like an old married couple who have grown tired of each other.The other casualty is the action scenes. The great Sam Peckinpah once said of the violence in his films that he wanted the audience to feel the impact of getting shot. Modern day use of CGI and such does the exact opposite. It feels more like you're watching somebody else play a video game. While some praise the visuals, I criticize its effect of pushing the viewer further away rather than drawing them in.This could have been like Lethal Weapon IV and had some fun with its theme of the loose cannon dealing with aging. Instead its more like Beverly Hills Cop III and becomes a sad entry in an otherwise solid franchise.","279 out of 400 found this helpful.

The comedy?For me this latest installment of the franchise is weak on all of the above, so much so Martin Lawrence just became irritating and actually had no other function in the film other than retiring then coming back then retiring again.A 2 hour film which in places dragged and one of the weakest silliest plots I've ever seen in a film which disappointed me.Nowhere near as good as the 2 previous and especially bad because of Martin Lawrence so my score for this complete waste of time and money is,Rating 6 out of 10","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

Its a darker movie that drowns in despair for large part of the film and Smith and Lawrence dont have the comedy sparring of old to balance it out.

We're used to overly exaggerated action scenes in this kind of movies but here it just gets ridiculous. The chemistry between Will Smith and the normally always funny Martin Lawrence is completely lost. I could count the funny moments on one hand, and even with those I had to force a smile.

Not that it is bad (although it is not great) but it isn't a film I expected to see in 2020. I watched it anyway because I thought it might be fun - but I was wrong because it wasn't. It very much feels tired and pointless; maybe a different film was sold to those involved, but this feels churned out and lacking in energy. The plot has no roots, with contrivances and developments just thrown onto the table whenever some device is needed. It makes for a very hollow experience - and I say that as someone that went into this pretty much happy to get a generic action movie, as long as it was a fun one.While the plot is undeniably a mess, this was to be expected. The attempt at age-related reflection and repercussions doesn't fly one bit, and seems forced into a franchise that has never even glanced in the rear view mirror. What is a bigger disappointment is that the action and comedy is lacklustre. The second film was not great, but it had some very enjoyable action sequences, and plenty of excess. In this one there is the excess, but not much to enjoy in the same way. I didn't really find any of the action sequences to be thrilling or well delivered; they seemed obvious and overdone. The comedy is the harder thing to see fail - but it does it to itself by failing to make more of Martin Lawrence. In order to make the reflection and aging of Smith's character more engaging and real, it was important that Lawrence could be his anchor in a way that is grounded and funny. Lawrence does do that, but the film doesn't make enough of him - he feels side-lined for too long, and his material is not strong enough to get the good from him. Smith does his best, looks great doing it, but his material is hard going whether it is his unfunny banter, or the heavier material that we are supposed to care about. The supporting cast are decent but nothing more than that because there is not much for them to do.In the end, this is a so-so film at best, but not one that inspires much excitement or justifies its mid-credits cocky link to a fourth film. It has a lot of money and polish, but there isn't much heart to any of it - not from the people involved, or from the viewer (who will mostly be passively watching).","15 out of 30 found this helpful.

You would expect Miami detectives Mike Lowery (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) to be retired or dead by now.Here they are still going strong but Marcus is now a grandfather and he thinks about calling it a day.Mike though is almost fatally shot. His past as a rookie cop comes back to haunt him. Isabel Aretas is a widow of a Mexican drug cartel head. She has been jailed for a number of years and has now escaped with the help of her son Armando.Now they are hell bent on revenge on the people who put her and her late husband to jail as well as take back their power in the Mexican cartel. Armando has been trained to be a fledgeling gang leader and assassin.Isabel is a witch using her powers to incite hate. She also has a past association with Mike.Bad Boys for Life is a noisy cartoonish action film. It has over the top stunts, some humour and a laughable plot which really cannot be taken seriously.Will Smith who is now 51 is in good shape. Martin Lawrence who is only three years older looks rather portly and out of shape. However the two leads still have a good chemistry.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

But the movies do deliver adequate entertainment, but keep in mind that this is your typical Smith and Lawrence movie, for better or worse.The 2020 movie ""Bad Boys for Life"" does carry on in the spirit of the previous movies, combining elements of action and comedy in a good enough blend. So if you enjoyed the previous movies, then you will also enjoy this one, no doubt about it.And while there is an abundance of sarcastic and humorous banter between Smith and Lawrence, then it is something that sort of wears thin quite quickly, just as it has done in the previous movies.""Bad Boys for Life"" has a lot of action, which is what made the movie bearable for me, as I am not a particular fan of neither Will Smith or Martin Lawrence. They tend to be very monotonous in their performances, and if you've seen one of their movies, you've essentially seen all.Visually then ""Bad Boys for Life"" was quite good. The action sequences were very well executed and it felt like you were right there in the action alongside the actors and actresses.I am rating this movie six out of ten stars, as it was good entertainment. But this is hardly a movie that warrants a second viewing for my part, as I am not overly fan of the franchise or the two main actors.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Okay. Definitely Not On The Same Level as the First Two.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5466659/?ref_=tt_urv","plasticanimalz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2613818/?ref_=tt_urv","7 February 2020","I think if they were just going to go for a dumb action movie, they should have wrapped this up in 90 minutes. Going for a full 2 hours, there needed to be more explored and have more depth. Bad Boys and Bad Boys 2 were both highly entertaining and fun, this was more of a paint-by-numbers action film with nothing new or special, sprinkled with a sort of old and tired version of Will Smith and Martin Lawerence, and a few cool elements that were never really explored.Directing - mediocre, script - mediocre, acting - decent (with the exception of DJ Khalid, he's terrible, why is he 'acting?'), action - okay, music - great. I think if I had to sit through this and it wasn't Will Smith and Martin Lawerence, I would probably like this a lot less. They do have good chemistry, I just felt like they were doing this for the paycheck and weren't that committed. I'm not saying Will needs to hang up his action booties yet, but he needs to start doing yoga and limber up and hire an Asian guy as his stunt double. He looks cool and is cool, he just moves like an old, stiff man. He's an old man in a young man's game and it shows. Basically, Keanu Reeves is the only middle-weight action guy over 40 who can still pull off action. Dwayne Johnson, John Cena and heavy weight action dudes can more easily pull off getting older 'cause they just need to punch and give guys the clothes hanger and people cheer. Smaller guys like Will, Keanu, Tom Cruise, we expect Jackie Chan and The Matrix. Basically, gymnast meets kung fu, but looks cool holding a weapon. I'm guessing with all the training Keanu had to do for The Matrix, it paid off, and he still holds up to the younger guys. Simply, Will and Martin need to step it up, or they need to sneer and use their brains more, and be the rugged detectives.The most exciting parts was AMMO, which they trimmed their role in the film so they wouldn't upstage Will and Martin, which they do. AMMO is basically the tactical sexy squad of GQ models and hot women. And the bad guy, also very GQ. So, they had some actor / actress eye candy, the film had that going for it, it just needed more. Also, they never really explain or make sense of the bad guy being a drug cartel guy who just happens to know Krav Maga, be a sniper, and a motorcycle expert? That made no sense. Like, did he serve in Afghanistan since birth? He was a little too good at too many things to seem realistic, which kills tension.And why is DJ Khalid in a movie? This is the second time I've seen him in a film and it makes zero sense. The man can not act. He's straight up terrible. All I can think when I see him is, ""Why is this guy in a movie? He can't act."" When he opened his mouth in Pitch Perfect 3, people in the audience started laughing at him. Not to mention, he's music sucks, and he's not cool. Mixing beats is easy and his mixes are generic and lame. It escapes me how he is even a thing. Like, I feel it's some kind of joke 'cause he has no talent and seems like someone's uncool dad.Wait for this as a rental. I wish I would have done that and saved myself almost $25 between the ticket and snacks. You don't really gain much from seeing this in the theater as the action was not all that great, and I would have rather had the ability to pause and take breaks. Nice to see Will and Martin back together, it's too bad it wasn't better.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

The storyline follows our favorite detective duo for one last case. Marcus is ready to retire and Mike think's he's crazy. As a new set of killers arrive in town, Mike and Marcus may have one last good deed left in them as a dynamic duo. This movie was codirected by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah; who also co directed Black, and stars Will Smith (Independence Day), Martin Lawrence (Martin), Vanessa Hudgens (Spring Breakers), Alexander Ludwig (Vikings) and Charles Melton (Riverdale). The storyline in this was just okay but the action scenes do their best to make-up for it. The film relies on the witty banter and chemistry between Lawrence and Smith. That aspect of the move is very entertaining. The movie is well paced and had a fast and furious feel to it in many ways. Overall this was a fun family film that is worth your time. I'd score this a 7/10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The whole Ammo team seems unnecessary, Badboys is about Smith and Lawrence.. My interest in the ammo team was the same as my interest in the ""new recruits"" used in expendables.. Zero! I watched the film to see bad boys not a fictional team that takes time away from them.. Anyway other than that the only other thing that bugs me is how they've rewritten Mike and Marcus story to fit in the new plot.. Like how would Marcus not notice that Mike went undercover during their academy days.. Fall in love, bust an international drug cartel boss and never bring it up with Marcus.. Seems like the writers just lost interest with that but as its a comedy aswell I guess it can be overlooked. Action scenes are brilliant, comedy is great and the plot moves along nicely. I hear there are plans for a 4th, if that is true then I hope they make it about Mike and Marcus and drop all that new team for a new generation crap..","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It has some genuine character moments and laughs with Marcus and Mike throughout its runtime, and any fan of the series should watch for the classic chemistry of these actors alone.However, this is a much different Bad Boys, and many fans are going to hate it.Michael Bay was perfect for this series. Bad Boys 2 is and always will be an action classic. The sequel's set pieces mixed with its innovative, frenetic action was enough make it stand out, but legends Will Smith and Martin Lawrence gave the script the comedic and charismatic gravitas needed to thoroughly entertain.One of those two things is still true for the series' third and presumably final entry.Bad Boys for Life needed to be a 2.5 hour behemoth of an action movie, and it was never going to be. This is very muted take on the outlandish series with only glimpses and stabs at its former glory.The new directors tried to take this movie in a more genuine, heartfelt direction with more focus on interesting characters and plot developments instead of funny scenes in between grandiose action.And it works for much of the runtime. It isn't near the spectacle or guilty pleasure that BB2 was. At all.But, does it have to be? Many fans would argue that it does, though I suspect this movie will age decently, because some of the dialogue and comedy between its stars is gem-worthy.As a third and assumed final entry for Marcus and Mike, this movie ultimately fails to live up to its predecessors, and it knows it from the jump.Yet, as a entertaining romp with a couple of characters that I genuinely enjoy, Bad Boys for Life is a good way to waste a couple of hours.6.7/10 for me, rounded up to 7 because it was fun.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Martin Lawrence is so much... fleshier. Will Smith, albeit in better shape, is also thicker and both are noticeably older. With that being the case, how could it be as good?It wasn't, though it wasn't bad. The movie didn't have the Michael Bayisms from part two, which is a plus. This time it was directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah who still tried to deluge us with action whenever possible.The plot eschewed drugs this time around in lieu of a more personalized crime. Someone wants Mike Lowery (Will Smith) dead and the assailant is a super-criminal. This is not a Marvel movie, but you wouldn't be blamed if you believed it was based upon the killer pursuing Mike
Lowery. This guy could rival Wolverine with his speed, agility, and kill strikes.The plot was a bit thick. Whether it was as a means to make it international or as a means to be clever or maybe even just to have a greater emotional impact--in any case, I would've preferred it to be simpler.I have to admit, I was distracted part way through the film by the myriad updates and calls I got about the death of Kobe Bryant. It was hard to stay focused after that. I was never a Kobe fan because he played for the Lakers, which is a rival team, but I respected the hell out of his game. I only hate good opposing players and I certainly hated Kobe, but it was purely sports related.Sorry for that mid-review tribute. BBFL, no spring chickens, still funny, not mad I watched.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's set up as a finale, but isn't really - Mike (Smith) and Marcus (Lawrence) are back as the smart-ass Miami detectives who drive around dangerously in their Porsche - or minivan. Some things have changed since the first two films, but not much - Howard (Pantoliano) is still the Captain, they still don't play by the rules, and they still call themselves ""bad boys"" often. This time, a Mexican gangster's wife, Isabel (del Castillo) and her son Armando (Scipio) are after revenge on Mike for killing Isabel's husband.There's a couple of 'twists' - none of which are as big or impactful as they're supposed to be. Smith and Lawrence are still good together, always wisecracking and joking with each other, but there's not really many overtly funny moments or laughs. They team up with the AMMO team, a new police squad led by Lieutenant Rita (Nunez) and her three Millennials (Hudgens, Ludwig and Melton), who are presumably there for the sequel(s), if/when Mike & Marcus retire. AMMO are OK, but don't provide too much.There's still a few car chases, lots of explosions and unlikely stunts, and plenty of gun battles. If you've seen the first two, you know what to expect. It's not a bad action/buddy-cop film, but - can't believe I'm saying this - it might actually miss Michael Bay directing. At times, it takes itself far too seriously and is more earnest than it probably should be. Could've done with a bit more humour and fun.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

And in many scenes, they hit that sweet spot by bringing outright out-loud laughter from the audience.The background of this story is that these two have worked together for twenty plus years and, during this time, created havoc in the Miami Police Department by being both hasty in their actions and unconventional in their investigative methods. The directors, Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah put this right up front in the opening scenes when they have the detectives drive through Miami at recklessly high speeds in Lowery's 911 Porsche.Burnett wants to retire but gets yanked away from fulfilling this dream when Lowery gets riddled with five bullets from Armando (Jacob Scipio), an assassin riding a motorcycle down one of Miami's boulevards. In another early scene, we see Armando breaking his mother Isabel Aretas (Kate del Castillo) out of prison.Isabel is intent on revenging an old score which resulted in the death of her husband. She asks Armando to kill all that had to do with her former husband's death. One of the aspects of Isabel that the audience is made aware of early is that she sees herself as a witch of some sort.Directing the detective's work over the years was Captain Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano). After Lowery's shooting, he brings on his newly formed AMMO (Advanced Miami Metro Operations) squad to solve the case of all the current assassinations by using data and more conventional crime resolution techniques. This team is led by Lowery's ex-girlfriend Rita (Paola Nunez).Lowery won't be held back and goes out to find his assassin and finally convincing Burnett to come out of retirement to help him one last time.The rest of the film is about the slight conflicts between the AMMO squad and Lowery and Burnett's tactics on finding and dealing with the assassins.The AMMO team has some hilarious interactions with Lowery and Burnett, which helped set the stage. However, it was Marcu's comments to Mike that got the most laughs. One funny scene was when Mike names the color dye Mike uses to cover the gray in his goatee.However, what didn't work was the convoluted shootouts, two specifically, one in a warehouse garage and the other in an old hotel that was confusing. Just too much noise and shooting that didn't make a whole lot of sense.Smith was his typical smart-alecky competent self. As such, he was perfect for this role. Lawrence was terrific as the sidekick attempting to bring some sanity to his partner's life. Pantoliano was solid as a police captain. Nunez was good as Lowery's former girlfriend and leader of AMMO. Castillo was okay as the woman looking for revenge. Vanessa Hudgens, as Burnett's all-knowing supportive wife, was terrific. Chris Bremner, Peter Craig, and Joe Carnahan wrote the screenplay. Directors Arbi and Fallah did a good job of bringing both action and comedy to bear.Overall: There was nothing memorable about his film or story, but it was a fun experience.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I mean which criminal son who has never met his father be so willing to go to the other side. And I also wished that Martin Lawrence had a bit more part than just being out of shape cop.

When I heard that the dynamic duo, Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) were returning to the big screen, I did think that it was going to be two geriatric cops, shooting guns on there zimmer frames, but it was surprisingly full of intense action. Martin Lawrence did get on my nerves after a while because he couldn't keep up with Superman, Will Smith, who looked as young and fit as he did in the first movies. I also wasn't impressed with the comedy throughout the film, which didn't have the punch that the first movies did, but with that aside, it was good to see them together again. When I also heard that Michael Bay wasn't returning to direct the third instalment, I thought that there was no way that this movie would work, but I must admit, it fits in well into the franchise. Although the action was pretty far-fetched, it was put together well, and the tension, kept you glued to the screen. On the downside, it's nothing that we haven't seen before, and once the plot is revealed, it's not the type of film that you would watch time and time again, like the previous films. That's not to say that it's a bad film, it's just that it lacked that special Michael Bay, over-exaggerated but original action, and I missed the funny humour. The new AMMO team was a great addition to the cast, and it was good to see Agent Howard taking control of the misfits again, but once the situation takes a turn for the worse, the film gets serious and it turns into your regular cops and robbers type of movie. It's still worth a watch and I'm sure that audiences will enjoy it but it won't go down as the best in the franchise. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Adil El Arbi & Bilall Fallah, who brought you Image in 2014, Black, which is highly recommended from movie-goers, and Patser in 2018. As I haven't seen any of there previous work, it's hard to compare this movie to anything that they have done, but after watching the bonus material on the Blu-ray, I can see that they took this project seriously, and they worked closely with Jerry Bruckheimer and Will Smith, who also produced this film. Personally, I thought this was going to be another one of those movies that a franchise could do without, but I was surprisingly entertained. I wouldn't be rushing to watch it again, and there weren't any moments that struck a chord, but I have seen worse.Budget: $90million
Worldwide Gross: $425millionGenre: Action, Comedy, Crime, Thriller

This is also the first Bad Boys movie to be not directed by Michael Bay.
The movie takes place in Miami where Mike Lowrey(Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett(Martin Lawrence) have to face off again a mother and son pair of drug lords who causes havock to the city,and it's more of a personal investigation for the two(not going into much spoilers though). The movie takes only a few minutes to set up and it's a less energetic ride than the rest of the movies. The chemistry of Will and Martin is still great in here and shows us an enthusiastic Mike and an almost retired Marcus. The supporting actors were one dimensional yet exciting. The villain here is better than the last two movies and had some characterisation in it. The cinematography was actually better than the last two, had some really good shots and was actually ""colourful"" than the last two. The music was okish and they underutilized the theme song. The pacing was okay. It was comedic,at some points.
The main problem of this movie is that this was an exhausted movie. In the second movie,Bay set up the action scenes to a top level and this movie failed to even reach half of it's. Maybe because the characters are at their 50s now or maybe because the production cost was lesser than the last one and the existing sequences weren't even that exciting. You won't get the feel of the first two movies in here except for the character chemistry. It was also less funnier than the last two.
I recommend this movie for all the Bad Boys fans and buddy cop type movie lovers. For those who admire ""Bayhem"", you'll be dissapointed here.Rating- 6.5/10Sony Pictures

The ride together mantra that seems constantly repeated throughout the film made it feel like I was watching a boring version of a Fast and Furious movie.

ACTIONThird Bad Boys movie starring Mike (Will Smith) and Marcus (Martin Lawrence) as they are older. And apparently, there's a historical connection between the killer woman, Isabel Aretas (Kate del Castillo) who was married to the cartel who wants Mike killed and her biological trained killer son, Armando Aretas (Jacob Scipio). There are subtle influences from the ""Fast and the Furious"" movies as well as the Danial Craig's rebooted James Bond movies because of the very heavy drama and minuscule comedy. The first and second ""Bad Boys"" movies have more action which is why I liked them more as opposed to this one, at times does not even appear to belong to the first Bad Boys movies. But like the James Bond movies with Danial Craig, more people prefer the 'soap opera' scenarios than the fun Bad Boys movies that made them what they are in the first place. Go figure!!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The dialogue is much sharper and funnier and not repeated over and over by 15 year olds at school after watching it funny but actually funny, funny. It has plot twists where the other two barely even had a plot. The two originals Will Smith and Martin Lawrence team up with a special team called AMMO who are made up of a group of typically politically correct characters you find in mainstream films nowadays. Martin Lawrence is considering retirement and Will Smith acts exactly how he did in the 1995 original which works in the films favour. The plot and the action is at times over the top but that is what the audience is expecting.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But their relative calm is shattered when Lowrey is brutally gunned down and left for dead. Surviving the ordeal with his friend by his side, Lowrey heads out on a quest for vengeance, but the truth behind the attack may be more than he could have imagined.For such an apparently successful franchise, the Bad Boys film series has been just about the most sporadic I can ever remember. The first sequel was a massive surprise, arriving eight years after the original graced our screens, and now the third film in the series has arrived, a massive twenty five years after the first one. The phrase 'make hay while the sun shines' doesn't seem to have registered in the makers minds, seemingly confident of the apparent enduring appeal the series will have, although it's apparently had an impressive opening weekend and a fourth film is now in the works (that I'm guessing we'll see in about 2050!)It's careful to deliver all the goods the audience is expecting, and so is wisely crammed full of fast paced, explosive action, slow, moody views of the Miami sideline, cool, slo-mo shots of the stars sliding their jackets on and the wise-cracking banter between the pair. It's testament to the lead stars that they can seemingly switch their on-screen chemistry back on like a tap, last on screen together seventeen years ago but laying it on like it's just been a day. Despite a darker, grittier edge to the plot, there's still loads of effective, funny humour on screen to take the edge off, as well as an admittedly clever, unexpected plot twist at the end.It's surprisingly better than the first sequel, despite sharing it's suffocating over-indulgence and at times uncomfortable blur between the heroes and the villains. Still, one hopes this really is the end, and we don't really have 'Bad Boys for Life.' The thought of a senior citizen Marcus and Lowrey, with zimmer frames and hearing aids (but still with their foul mouths!) coming at us in quarter of a century's time is too much. ***","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Have a look through the review section, there are just waves and waves of 10/10 reviews with identical ""users found this helpful numbers"", which I think have been balanced out by actual people down-voting them (good on you).This movie somehow manages to be a blemish on the strictly average, but good in a b-grade movie sort of a way, legacy of the Bad Boys franchise. The first movie was okay, the second embraced its silliness completely and in my opinion, while very crass and low-brow at times, is very entertaining and re-watchable. The action sequences are unique and without having watched it in years I still remember the ""Reggie"" scene, the shootout with the Haitian(?) gangsters through the wall, Marcus getting shot  the mortuary scene, the big shootout at the end and many other things. Bad Boys two also felt like a more comprehensively planned out movie and was as tonally consistent as it could be.Bad Boys For Life is terrible, Smith and Lawrences characters have become incredibly cliche parodies of their former selves, which was already a pretty cliche buddy-cop dynamic. There are some awful narratives propagating through this movie, with Marcus being an even bigger wuss than ever and Mike being an even bigger moron than ever. All the new characters are laughably one-dimensional and make for some pretty painful dialogue and moments. Most of the action is not even laughably bad or ridiculous, its almost sad how bad or stupid some of the action sequences were. One particular moment that made me question what I was seeing was when Will Smith slid along the ground on a mechanic's creeper (skateboard thing) while spray paint cans explode behind him, it looked so clunky, almost as if they couldn't be bothered trying a few takes with it.Apologies for the rather poorly formatted rant, but to be honest this review is kind of befitting of the movie that it regards. Bad Boys For Life was a bafflingly poor and disappointing entry into this franchise. I'm all for dumb action-comedies, but this movie is weighted heavily towards the ""dumb"" side with the ""comedy"" and ""action"" aspects looking rather malnutritioned by comparison. I actually don't know how Will Smith and Martin Lawrence were okay with this script and the final product, but I suppose neither actor has actually been very good at picking roles or signing off on good movies. Hopefully this review provides a bit more of a perspective on the movie than all the ""10/10 The Bad Boys are Back, this actor/actress is good, the comedy/action/emotion gripped me by the nipples, you wont be disappointed, best movie I have seen in 2020"" reviews that are plaguing the Bad Boys For Life IMDB review section.","84 out of 138 found this helpful.

Don't get me wrong I loved the original, and tolerated the sequel, Bad Boys For Life takes the spirit of the previous 2 and injects genuine heart and sincere struggle, it reflects on one's mortality and ask tough questions about when we cease to be what we hope to be. We get old, life takes on a different meaning, do we embrace that or go in the opposite direction and chase what we were instead of what we aspired. Both Will and Martin are as cheeky and dynamic as ever.

The plot consists of the usual cop movie clichés as some wicked underworld types with their own twisted sense of honor force the aging detectives to team up with a younger, more tech-savvy generation of cops, while also working out their own (extremely) personal issues. Shot in a kinetic visual style with nice looking scenery, some recognizable returning characters, and the expectedly super violent action scenes, a few which are exciting, most which lack a definitive spark and eventually become redundant. After a decent start the pace lags, the humor becomes stale, and the finale piles on the absurdities, despite some occasional attempts at emotional depth. It manages to get as far as it does thanks to Smith and Lawrence who do their best to show that they've still got some gas left in the tank. **","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I believe that this movie was good and this was mainly due to the fact the Michael Bay was not the director of the movie in which I'm usually one to back him but after watching 6 Underground and Transformers The Last Knight, I just can't trust this guy even for mindless fun anymore. But yes, this movie was surprisingly really good and a fun time in the cinema.The chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is the major factor as to why this movie is funny, they simply have good on screen chemistry which is what a buddy cop movie requires to succeed. The acting is serviceable for the movie too however, there is one scene in particular where I thought Will Smith's acting was really good and this occurs whilst his character is trying to persuade Martin Lawrence's character, Marcus Bennett to not quit and I felt an emotional impact within that scene which is something I did not expect coming into a comedy/action movie.On another hand, the action sequences were done really well and yet again, thanks to the fact that Michael Bay was not the one directing the movie, the action sequences did not have 60 cuts from 300 different angles as every Michael Bay usually has but it flows extremely well where cuts aren't as regular as you would aspect. During the final huge 'battle' sequence, it was simply jaw-dropping beautiful to see and I can't really explain it but it was extremely stylistic and it blew my mind while I was watching this movie.As for the plot, well, there isn't anything incredible about it, it's a serviceable plot for what the movie sets up to achieve but let's be honest here, nobody goes to these sorts of movies expecting a thought provoking or life changing experience, well, at least I don't.All in all, this is a good time in the cinema but there isn't anything spectacular to it or anything but it sure is a good time in the cinema.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

The film has plenty of diversity that actually works (and that is very, very rare). The story is reasonably predictable, however, what surprised me was the lack of identity politics. When you expect a ""girl power"" moment (like every other film has pushed for the last 5 years), this film doesn't deliver. That's so refreshing. The decisions made by characters actually make sense (again, very rare today).However, the second half let's the film down a lot. Stupid chase scenes that reach farcical, plot holes like Swiss cheese, twists that defy credibility, action scenes that feel like a budget film.However, it's fun to watch. If you're looking for a mindless Will Smith film, this is fun and doesn't tax the brain.Points lost for the second half being weak and almost incoherent at times. If it matched the first half, I'd probably score it 9/10","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

"6","/10","""The Boys Are Back In Town""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5463950/?ref_=tt_urv","westerfieldreviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112001790/?ref_=tt_urv","6 February 2020","""The Boys Are Back In Town""Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah teamed up to finally bring the long-rumored Bad Boys 3 to life after over a decade in order to reinvigorate the franchise with more new installments certainly on the horizon. ""Bad Boys for Life"" sees Martin Lawrence and Will Smith returning nearly sixteen years later to reprise their roles as detectives Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowry respectively, as they tag along with a fun team of newcomers. ""Bad Boys For Life"" is an entertaining film that offers exciting action and plenty of laughs for everyone to enjoy throughout its two-hour runtime, with the exception of a few hiccups and humorless scenes/jokes that occasionally fail to land. The narrative found within ""Bad Boys For Life"" takes a backseat causing the film to bring summer early.
""Bad Boys For Life"" picks up seventeen years after the events of ""Bad Boys II"" and rehashes some of the same plotlines we have seen before. Detectives Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and Mike Lowry (Will Smith) are still going strong, but after witnessing the birth of his grandson, Marcus decides that it is time for him to step into retirement. The film transitions over and introduces us to a new duo of antagonists, that being crime boss Isabel Aretas (Kate del Castillo) and her son Armando Aretas (Jacob Scipio); we pick up with Isabel as she breaks free from prison with the help of Armando. With Isabel broken free, she vows to enact revenge on the men she deems responsible for her husband's death. Isabel sends Armando to the states with a hit list, and at the very top of that list is none other than Mike Lowry. Shortly after Armando's arrival, tragedy strikes prompting the film to jump forward in time by six months. During that six-month interval, Armando assassinates several of the targets all while building an empire in the city of Miami. With the case now being personal, Marcus and Mike are now determined to bring Armando to justice and end his killing spree once and for all. However, the bad boys are forced to enlist the help of the newly created, Advanced Miami Metro Operations (AMMO) unit which is comprised of four fresh faces, Kelly (Vanessa Hudgens), Dorn (Alexander Ludwig), and Rafe (Charles Melton) who are led by Rita (Paola Nuñez), Mike's ex-girlfriend. With our team fully assembled, they go forth meeting several colorful characters while shooting and laughing their way to Armando until the final body drops.
""Bad Boys For Life"" on many fronts is simply put, a fun film. Immediately the film reintroduces us to the stellar duo of Lawrence and Smith (it's as if the film knows they are it's greatest assets) and it feels so right. From the film's opening moments, the apparent chemistry both Lawrence and Smith exude on-screen feels completely natural for the long-standing crime-fighting partners. Regardless of if they are bouncing jokes off of each other and sharing a laugh or verbally mocking one another, this dynamic duo brings every moment to life in a riveting way that will have audiences smiling and laughing until the very end. When talking about the cast, it should be noted that every member pulls their separate weight. The newcomers from the AMMO unit being Hudgens, Ludwig, and Melton all do a serviceable job of being entertaining more often than not, despite being completely cliched one-note characters. All across the board, the major takeaway that I walked away with after viewing ""Bad Boys For Life"" is that everyone was having an absolute blast while on set. Another strong mark for this film is its high octane action (it was partially sold on it). ""Bad Boys For Life"" features a total of three different action set pieces; a close-quarters shootout, a high-speed chase that devolves into a shootout, and a final shootout in a ruined local. These action sequences are distinct in their visual presentation and feel wholly unique when next to one another. Unfortunately, when you look past the scope of the film, nothing done is enthralling or interesting. However, the film is not a complete generic snooze fest given the variance of the environments and the dynamic gimmicks that are added as a bonus ingredient in every shootout. But, barring a few small moments within each action sequence, everything committed within ""Bad Boys for Life"" has been displayed and executed substantially better in other bombastic action blockbusters.
Despite ""Bad Boys For Life"" being the only movie in the three-filmed franchise to not be directed by Michael Bay himself, Arbi and Fallah do a fairly good job of replicating his style as the film displays very clear shades of Bay. Does the story take a backseat to the action? Check! Do the characters crack a joke every few seconds? Check! Do several of those jokes fall flat? Check! Is the villain a false menace that accomplishes nothing? Check! (You get the point) ""Bad Boys For Life"" was not directed by Michael Bay, but it was certainly crafted with all of the ingredients from his shop. The film features a shallow plot with story beats that are quite frankly laughable at times but is enjoyable due to the fun dynamics that are on display by the cast and crew. ""Bad Boys For Life"" refuses to reinvent the franchise which some will find problematic, while others will find it endearing; personally, I do not love it or hate it, I am indifferent on it, I enjoyed many aspects of the film, but on the flip side could care less about just as many. However, if the next installment (which is definitely on its way) releases in a timely manner and takes no creative leaps forward, all of the glitz and glamour found here will certainly fade away next time.Final Verdict: C-","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Bad Boys Forever is a grateful attempt to update the franchise created by Bay for modern times, questioning some old traditions and respecting others","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6018836/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","22 August 2020","Almost twenty years after the release of the second part, Bad Boys presents a change in its creative team for this third part. Michael Bay leaves and Belgian directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah enter. Although the direction is not of Michael Bay, known for his exaggerations, the tone remains similar, as the production is of no less exaggerated Jerry Bruckheimer (Top Gun, Top Gun, Bad Boys), alongside Will Smith and Doug Belgrad. After a relatively successful streak in 2003, stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence return to what would be the ""final mission"". Smith and Lawrence, who in their mid-90s were in their 30s, are now fifty in the midst of the new scenario in which we live.Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) has a grandson and is about to retire when Mike Lowrey (Smith), a bachelor and his partner for decades, suffers an attack and is on the verge of death. Upon returning, Lowrey seeks revenge and Burnett tries to leave his hectic life behind, while the police department receives a new, younger team, made up of Lieutenant Rita (Paola Núñez), invasion police officer Kelly (Vanessa Hudgens), the muscular nerd Dorn (Alexander Ludwig) and hacker / sniper Rafe (Charles Melton).The duo Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah abuse the panoramic views with paradisiacal scenery, sports cars and luxurious life. To enhance the look of our time, there are even photo filters that you can easily find on an influencer's Instagram. This, of course, serves as a reference to the first features and to connect with new viewers. The script by the trio Chris Bremner, Peter Craig and Joe Carnahan bet on the successful chemistry between Smith and Lawrence - although the moments of laughter are far less inspired and frequent than in the previous features. Furthermore, without the same physical form as before, the action sequences lack more intense pursuits or more realistic fight scenes, without so much editing, as in John Wick, for example. This third part deals with the virtue of talking about the past, guilt, redemption and legacy becomes inevitable, and these issues are not always addressed with good will. Fortunately, in the case of ""Bad Boys Para Semper"", good humor is the thread used to sew the weight of time together with the action scenes that conquered the audience 25 years ago, but without losing the charisma while showing that things have changed, and that is part of it.
The arrival of the team led by Rita brings an interesting counterpoint to the ""old guard"" police. The group has a potential friction between Lowrey and Rafe, in addition to a probable romance with Rita, while there is a clear intention of the directors to create a ""legacy"", passing the baton to the new generation. Vanessa Hudgens' lineup is not for nothing - and there is even an Easter egg with a comic strip about it - and here follows the predictable clash between veterans and newbies, while we see different approaches. For example, just like in aerial shots, where we see larger scenes clearly made by drones, we also see flying robots and cell phones themselves in action. This dynamic between the older police duo and the younger officers is one of the things with the greatest potential in the film. However, this is somewhat wasted, as there is not enough screen time for the characters. They lacked sentimental connections, which they could eventually share, to make their relationships more interesting.The directors also explore the neon ambience that has become almost mandatory in the most recent music videos (especially in reggaeton music videos) and the addition of two big names in contemporary music, like Nicky Jam in the role of one of the main cartel dealers and the producer DJ Khaled playing (albeit almost as a cameo) an butcher and illegal arms and ammunition seller, is also part of the attempt to modernize the franchise and contextualize the current image of a culturally diverse Miami. And look: already as a reflection of our modern times, there is a certain discussion about violence. We know that many of the successful films in the ""Rambo Era 2"" had a very debatable motto, with the American ""hero"" murdering 300 Vietnamese to save four Americans. In the story, Lawrence's character and the conclusion itself (and the villain) approach this theme with more consistency and verisimilitude than in other times.
At the same time, ""Bad Boys Para Semper"" still skids on already tiring stereotypes of films about cartels and Latin American culture, such as the Mexican villain who is called a witch by the American duo because she prays for Santa Muerte, a figure popularly known for Catholic culture in Mexico and strongly associated with drug dealers and cartels; female police officers who still play the role of femme fatale during the mission that requires a certain level of disguise; and even some decisions made by the protagonist duo in the course of the film. Ironically, the sequel also tries to correct other narrative vices of the genre, showing one of the young policemen as a rough man as a guy who just wants to work in the more technological part of the police and live away from the violence that marked his past; while another takes the liberty of biting Mike and Marcus with sarcasm and the certainty that he knows the things in life that only youth brings.This is also the most dramatic film of the three. Tragedy strikes at once and continues to emerge, punctuating history throughout the duration. Real losses are felt here, giving greater weight to the work. But this does not mean that humor is left out - with the very fine chemistry between the protagonists. And how great it is to see Martin Lawrence back on the big screen after a long hiatus, demonstrating that he is still a master at making artThe atmosphere of reckoning and completeness built in Bad Boys Forever almost justifies the uncompromising tone of its predecessors, which for a younger generation can be read as outdated, while for those who cling to the nostalgia of the 1995 film the conclusion can be that the first film has ""aged badly"" if they decide to revisit the plot from the beginning. However, the third part comes to show that it is never too late to recognize and settle your pending issues with the past full of mistakes and guilt to create a present without resentment and a legacy worth remembering.Bad Boys Para Semper lives up to the phrase repeated over and over in the three films in the franchise: ""we walk together, we die together"", but this time it is said in unison by more people. Since Marcus' son-in-law, that same 15-year-old boy who was bullied by the two main characters in Bad Boys II; even the captain lived by Joe Pantoliano, star of one of the most courageous decisions of the script in this feature. The atmosphere of returning to a franchise so beloved by fans and its good ambience these days are the perfect components of this meeting. Here, the villains are the best in the franchise, and are closely linked to the story of the heroes. Entertaining, genuinely funny and, to the general surprise, emotional, the film rescues old-fashioned entertainment - when Hollywood still cared about more than effects and action. Something called humanity. The film, moreover, is clearly an attempt to not only continue the story, but to start a new wave of sequels. New characters are introduced and some of them are due to return in the next feature - which has already been confirmed. The whole supporting team presents a new dynamic with the protagonists and is very fun.It is important to emphasize that to enjoy the film, it is necessary to buy the idea of the simple plot, which prioritizes action and fun without compromise over verisimilitude. Not only for action scenes that go against the laws of physics, but also for some events that are poorly explained in the plot, in addition to an unreasonable script twist. Betting on the clash of generations between the secondary cast and the main duo, it is clear that the very direction of Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah move between their own identity and several reverences to the cinema of Bay. Therefore, we have both the presence of the absurd (villains with bazookas in helicopters) as well as an action dynamic much more focused on an aesthetics of the choreography of movements and points of view that often transport us to visions of cameras embedded in vests or drones. Finally, Bad Boys Forever is a grateful attempt to update the franchise created by Bay for modern times, questioning some old traditions and respecting others, especially the companionship of Mike and Marcus.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Bad boys for life features great character development for the the two leads as well as some of the supporting characters.

I just thought id have a glance at the reviews here after having seen the film expecting the ratings to echo that disappointment but was amazed to find out so many people loved it, makes me wonder if maybe they have all been payed by the production company to keep viewer numbers up, each to their own i suppose.Personally i thought it was really lacking in any humour and the attempts at humour were very forced and awkward, just a lot of we're both to old jokes, there was no story line as such, well there sort of was, but it was a pretty lame excuse for a plot, and it was completely unrecognisable to the 1st films, I'm not saying that instantly made for it being a bad film but the majority of the other reviews are saying ""if u liked the 1st two you'll love this one? It was just a bit cringeworthy in places, some very overly American emotional tug on the heart strings bits that were pretty pathetic and very cheesy and predictable.And now for a more general rant:
Just recently i have noticed more and more that alot of films massively overdo the action visual effects and stunts to the extent that i almost find myself getting bored from action overload. I know that sounds ridiculous when talking about an action film but hear me out. I mean there is so much happening on the screen with the hugely over exaggerated shot em ups and impressive unnecessary elaborate stunts with out any story line what so ever, im beginning to think it is done deliberately to daze and distract the viewer from the fact that the film is lacking in any real structure or content and is in fact crap.
If your staring wide eyed and open mouthed, drooling slightly, at the barrage of pretty colours and blur of movement on the screen, your unlikely to notice that there was a script let alone how bad it wasFor example why when on a motorbike mid chase winding through traffic and trying to shoot at someone with an uzi would u think i know what would help with my shooting accuracy lets pull a wheelie at the same time or a stopie (travelling along on just the front wheel) whilst trying to shoot. Very impressive that this stunt guy can do that but why? What did it actually bring to that action sequence? Silly little thing to pick up on i know but when this sort of thing is going on every minute of every film it just gets a bit daft. Its as relevant as having a hit man doing a 1 handed handstand off the bike while weaving through traffic and trying to shoot, very impressive but bloody ridiculous.
I'd just like the emphasis to be on making a decent very watchable film rather than lets fit in as many daft stunts and shoot outs as we can and make this into a visual circus.If I am, as i suspect, correct in my thinking that this is all just distraction from a glaringly bad film then it is obviously a tactic that is working - judging by the reviews attached to this curd of a film.

It's like they wrote them terribly on purpose. The lines delivered by smith and lawrence seemed forced and again, they seemed to be acting poorly on purpose as if they were being blackmailed or something and did the absolute worst job they could do. Lawrence delivers lines and is in my opinion a funny guy based on passed movies and his sitcome; Smith has never been funny but at least decent in line delivery. The time was rubbish on line delivery. The writing may actually be the first movie in history to be written by A.I. as either it was a computer script that wrote the script or some intellectually impaired adults at summer camp that had a ""scary story"" writing contest. I've seen Lawrence do some pretty funny roles as a female dressing up and sometimes it required latex and ""overweight person"" suits. That's the first thing I thought of when I saw Lawrence; it looks like he's wearing a fat person suit and looks sad. Yes, people get old and it shows (no really with Smith so much) and no grey hair, no aged and weathered wrinkled face on Lawrence, just a big fat turkey neck. The ""chock full of action"" in the ""TOP"" review was obviously written by someone who worked for this company or that person is a very......very very VERY simple person who really does enjoy the very.....very very VERY simple things in life. The stunts are not worthy to be classified as mediocre, you'll see better action on the golf course with Adam Sandler movies and the filter they used to give it that ""smokey/dusk"" effect to add that ""miami-sunset"" feel to the actual natural light was painfully insulting to my vision as it served no effect other than to balance the unnaturally white hot sunlight and act as a tint to reduce glare. I may be exaggerating a tiny bit on the 4 minutes before I decided to create an account after reading the poorly masked copy writer who (or very very very simple person) which had the top comment that made me waste my time, but looking at the pause on the stream; I was close. I made it to 4 minutes, 25 seconds...the part where they get out of the car after narrowly missing a bus and Smith making a really dumb remark (shame on you AI writers!) about ""don't throw up or spill something or whatever on my corinthian leather man!... then they get out and Lawrence bangs the door of the not very impressive looking car Will Smith seems to have a sexual relationship with the way he over exaggerates numerous times within the course of 4 minutes ""don't do this/do that"" repeatedly in regard to rules about his car. I was really looking forward to a good show tonight and decided to as how can a comedy go wrong with Lawrence in it and Smith there to do some great acting and filmed in beautiful Miami...damn was I wrong. This may be a fun movie for children; I'm not sure, I won't watch anymore. of it but decided to refute the guy's bullspit about the movie along with it's fake ratings that lured me in to a sequel I thought couldn't go wrong. This dribbe I'm writing is FAR more entertaining that the movie I bet and you this probably isn't the type of movie you need more than four minutes to determine it's a failure. Enjoyed the first movie somewhat but this is garbage. Don't waste your time, or do waste your time. I used to write copy for companies pretending to be a regular person while knowing to spam key words no more than five percent of 500 words for organic rankings with google and know how these huckster-bamboozling-pay4raters work and you should too. I could recommend some good movies instead of this flotsam with actors who appear to be doing it out of fear of blackmail, a death threat, or are so stoned out on pills or alchohol they are incapable of the once great timing and believable acting they had. Oh well. Hope this saves someone some time.","12 out of 16 found this helpful.

Zero flow and continuity. The plot was thin spending zero time on the twist and areas of story development they should have really focused on. Too much focus was spent on the fact they're getting old. WHO CARES. Ultimately they turned a fast paced military ops level action movie into a family drama at best. Very very disappointed. I hope they have the common sense to bring Michael Bay back.Action sequences were good, but there was also a significantly less amount of action scenes vs the 2nd. But once again, all the action sequences and comedic ""bad boys"" moments were diluted by the lack of pacing and action based flow that bad boys 1 & 2 had from end to end. The comedic moments are meant to be the breath of fresh air from the tense action moments. Because the film didn't have this pacing, the comedic moments made the jokes fall flat most of the time.I'm very happy Bad Boys 4 is on the works. BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL DIRECTOR!!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This was actually in the making for quite a while and has finally seen the light of the day.As usual, the script of a movie coming back after this long has to be something to do with lead character's past and Bad Boys is no different. Anyway, this time around the bad boys are chilling back in Miami having done little in the previous decade. While Mike still has got his adrenaline going, Marcus is all set for a retirement life as granddad. That's when the past comes to haunt them and Mike along with his unconventional Bad Boy methods has a hard time trying to find answers.This Bad Boys is slightly different than its predecessors. It obviously touches on how age has caught up to the lead characters and draws humour from the same. The movie also focuses on the team surrounding bad boys and not just Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. This movie kind of sets up for a young brigade takeover with actors like Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig and Jacob Scipio. The movie also has some music celebrity presence with DJ Khaled and Nikki Jam. While Will Smith does look younger than his Youtube videos, Martin Lawrence surely looks much older and suitable for the retirement talk which is carried throughout the movie. Although the movie starts with some cliched humour it does pick up itself as it goes along. The actions sequences are pretty decent, not too heavy or overly done.Overall Bad Boys for Life does offer a good bit of nostalgia, that Miami vibe and some classic action entertainment. But eventually still makes you wonder if there should be any more additions to this franchise.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

At some points the movie was simply hilarious and the combination of the interpretations of both Will Smith who played as Mike Lowrey and Martin Lawrence who played as Marcus Burnett worked as well as in the two previous ""Bad Boys"" movies. The direction which was made by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, it was very good and they did an excellent job on how they presented the plot and its plot twists, something that made it even more interesting and not boring. Lastly, I have to say that ""Bad Boys for Life"" is a nice action movie with plenty of action and also comedy that will make you laugh a lot and enjoy it very much.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

As the movie opens, Mike and Marcus are driving their Porsche at top speed while Miami cruisers are following. Turns out that Marcus' daughter is about to give birth to his first grandchild. We then go to ""San Maria Ixtel Prison, Mexico"". A female prisoner, with outside help, manages to escape. The woman is Isabel Aretas,
and she is keen on taking revenge against everyone, including Mike, responsible for sending her to jail and killing her husband. Isabel sends her son to Miami to handle it... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: after a 17 year hiatus, the Bad Boys return, sans director Michael Bay. Instead the helm is given to newcomers El Arbi and Fallah, two up-and-coming directors from Belgium in their early 30s and making their US directing debut. They do amazingly well in fact (and I don't say this because I hail originally from Belgium myself!). But the key to success is of course the return of Will Smith and Martín Lawrence as the buddy-cops. In particular Lawrence is effective as the retiree wanna-be. Indeed the movie features a ton of (R-rated) comedy and doesn't take itself too serious (which couldn't be possible with Michael Bay directing). Of course there is also the over the top action scenes with correlating (and R-rated) violence. ""Violence is what we do!"", reminds Mike. The photography is eye-candy from start to finish (it feels like a two hour commercial for Miami).""Bad Boys For Life"" opened wide last weekend and exceeded all expectations, both critically and commercially. (Sony has already announced that 4th Bad Boys will be coming.) I finally saw it this weekend. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at in a large theater was attended very well, with the audience hollering and hooting at all the right moments. As for El Arbi and Fallah, up next for them is ""Beverly Hills Cop 4"". If you like buddy cop movies or are simply a fan of Will Smith or Martin Lawrence, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Bay himself makes a hilarious and welcome cameo as a reminder that we're all glad he's not directing but he's sort of still involved.Martin Lawrence's Marcus who often played second fiddle to Smith and ended up just yelling incessantly has a logical conclusion his arc in this movie and Smith gets a fun arc in this movie. The extra characters looked bad in the trailer but work here tremendously. The action is satisfying and coherent and the references, callbacks and other nods were solid and exciting. And Loren Balfe's music is exhilarating.Everything is treated with sensitivity, there's real love here, modern sensibility, and empathy.

Martin Lawrence does a great job in the film. He adds the perfect amount of comedic relief. A personal complaint in the film is I feel like the plot often reveals things or takes jumps that don't really work with me or that feel unearned, and that can affect the story and flow of the film.

However this piece feels a little contrived as it steers more towards pleasing a wider audience than it does towards appealing to the original Bad Boys fans and fanatics. In attempting to be something for everyone films with cult followings like this one tend to loose it's essence and ultimately becomes nothing for anyone. Even still there are a lot of fun witty and what will most likely become classic scenes in this film which are worth seeing. On another note the common theme in the industry at this time to play with the re aging effect is something which should be greatly reconsidered, it was well done in The Irishman for a meaningful purpose in that particular story but is becoming way over used. All in all had this Bad Boys For life been the second installment of the trilogy and the sequel had been the last of the trilogy that would have been much more fulfilling an end to this saga, but since it wasn't we take it as we can get it.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Just a dull, humourless, cheap, rehash of old plots and tired formulas.Now in their 50's, Miami's finest are in the twilight of their careers. Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) is in denial though, still single, still working out and still taking down bad guys by any means necessary. Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) is ready for retirement though and looking for some peace and quiet, particularly as he has a new granddaughter. Their plans are thwarted though when a Mexican cartel returns to Miami and sets their sites on Mike, for his previous involvement in the incarceration of the boss.""Bad Boys For Life"" feels like a throwback, but not in a good way. Not in a ""return to the Nineties"", high concept, action thriller type of way. It's a throwback in the sense it's what sequels used to be. A cheaper to produce, pedestrian, follow up - designed to take money from people who liked the last one. And fair play to them, it has been timed perfectly to make as much money as possible.Everything about it is run of the mill. Bit of action, but nothing you haven't seen before. Bit of comedy, but nothing that last beyond the end credits. The story does have a little twist that I didn't see coming, but it comes pretty late after a well-worn story about taking out everyone involved in this old case. It's overblown with its emotional points too, including the death of a major character, which is then hilariously glossed over once the film reaches its conclusion. There's nothing specifically bad about it, it's just lacking compared to its contemporaries.It's irrational I know, but the title bothers me too. Given that it ends with such a sequel-baiting post credits scene, why wasn't this ""Bad Boys 3"" with ""Bad Boys 4 Life"" to follow it up?","24 out of 37 found this helpful.

It is entertaining and has some humour to it, but this third film seems rather laboured. It seems that this movie is trying too hard to be like the first films, but it is disjointed and at times rather flat. There are some good ""action' parts to the film, especially towards the end of the film. But much of the movie was just nonsense; bullets flying everywhere, people hiding behind cars which are apparently bullet proof, explosions which cause no damage; just stupid portrayal of deadly reality.However, it is supposed to be a ""comedy"", so that makes it OK? Perhaps film makers might need to look at the phrase ""Comedy"", but without ridiculous violence.Don't get me wrong, this was an OK movie, it has some comedy elements to it, but it is not a great movie.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Bad Boys for life will give that to you. I truly wasn't expecting myself to be thoroughly entertained and focused into an action movie like this. . Usually action movies are fully action packed with less focus on a story and less dialogue. This on the other hand was well balanced with all three and I'm very happy with it.
Mike and Marcus are near retirement but a mother and son drug lords are on a killing spree in Miami with havoc and vengeance. So the bad boys for life are in it for one last time together to stop the drug lords.
Surprisingly Michael Bay did not direct this third installment.Adil Alarbi and Bilal Fallah did and they did not disappoint at all. There were so many good scenes . One scene involved Martin Lawrence wanting to do something repeatedly. It was very funny. Another scene was horrific , I didn't want to be in that room. And a third scene that had me almost fooled . But one scene really got my maternal instincts up , feeling sad and emotional. Alexander Ludwig (Vikings), Vanessa Hudgens ( Highschool Musical) and Charles Melton (Riverdale) have small roles in this installment. But if there is a fouth one, they might make them bigger. I personally liked Ludwig's role, didn't buy Vanessa's acting and Melton was annoying. Every time I see Vanessa in a new movie, I'm convinced she needs to stick in musicals. And work more on romantic movies. They suit her more.
They gave us such a beautiful view of Miami at night, I was blown away. I was surprised they didn't play Inner Circle's Bad boys song that much or at all.
I absolutely loved every minute of Bad Boys for Life. It was purely entertaining with a good story.","36 out of 61 found this helpful.

A lot of the time you don't know what's happening. The worst was when Martin Lawrence's character falls off a ledge at a hotel but you have no idea how because of all the cuts. Did they even try? This feels like a cash grab. I usually find Will Smith charming even in bad movies but he couldn't care less in this. Martin Lawrence actually had some laughs.

It was an honest portrayal of the years that have gone by and where these cops would be now. In my opinion it was both Will and Martin's best performances out of all 3 movies because it was the first time we got to see some range from each of them.
I was really shocked that they killed off a long standing, main character of sorts so very entertaining.
The addition of the tech team makes sense as alot of crime elements have gone this way. Ivr read some comments about this being a feminist move but that's the biggest load of bull I've read. The team consists of 2 males and 2 females, all of which are skilled in their own area and act them very well.
The only reason I can see for people hating on this is that they have 'grown up' with the films and can't accept that they themselves haven't aged thus the characters couldn't have either. If they had they would find the main characters embracing the lose of eye sight etc as a hilarious anidote to that.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

The pace alternates between hyperkinetic action scenes and ponderous scenes that seem better suited to Lifetime.The action scenes are excellent, vibrant, thrilling, expertly choreographed, executed and photographed.The central plot is a simple tale of revenge with a few complications involving treachery, deceit, and betrayal. However, with considerable screen time devoted to six or eight subplots (including the B-story bromance), efforts to reboot the franchise and set up a sequel, and a few ""obligatory"" socially-conscious elements, the main plot and subplots seem underdeveloped. The plot also bears striking similarities to the plot of another recent movie with one of the main characters in a similar role confronting a similar villain, which tends to put a few cracks in the fourth wall.The film credits two directors and three writers. At times it feels as if somebody had spliced together scenes from two entirely different films.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It has the same feel, filmed the same way, which you see straight from the beginning, music is the same, plenty of wise cracks and violence and even Smith and Lawrence' chemistry still works.
The plot isn't too bad, it's not The Godfather, but you don't watch these films for an engrossing storyline, it's an action film, and that's what you get, as you did in the first two.

The actions were okay, but it wasn't like what it was before. It lacked the feeling that the original Bad Boys movie had. The story didn't feel original, and it felt like they just forced that storyline to get another sequel. I didn't care about the bad guys, and the sudden changes in their personality didn't help anything. The only highlight of this was that we get to see Marcus and Mike together again. The humor was still there. However, the other addition to the cast kind of annoyed me. I don't think they were necessary.SHOULD YOU WATCH IT: Just for the laughs.

For the record , Smith's the bad-ass narcotics officer with an itchy finger, Lawrence his calm, level-headed partner. Together they crack open drugs ring while leaving a trail of devastation in their wake. Marcus's daughter Megan (Bianca Bethune) has given birth to a baby boy from Megan's fiance Reggie (Dennis Greene). Marcus and his wife Theresa (Therese Randle) are proud their new grandson. Mike and Marcus's fellow officers, including Captain Howard (Joe Pantoliano), gather at a bar to celebrate Marcus becoming a grandfather. Meantime, in a Mexican prison, inmate Isabel Aretas (Kate Del Castillo) is muttering an incantation that draws a guard's attention. Isabel grabs a knife off the guard and stabs her, with the other inmates jumping in and stabbing her to death. Other guards take Isabel outside, only for her son Armando (Jacob Scipio) to help escape. This time Miami detectives Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) must face off against a mother-and-son pair of drug lords who wreak vengeful havoc on their city. Then Rita (Paola Nunez), who has just been promoted to lieutenant and is also Mike's ex, informs them that she is also now heading AMMO (Advanced Miami Metro Operations), which employs a younger team of police officers: Kelly (Vanessa Hudgens), Dorn (Alexander Ludwig), and Rafe (Charles Melton) . Ride Together !. Die Together !. Whatcha gonna do?. If you can't stand the heat, get out of Miami !.This routine cop comedy-thriller of Jerry Bruckheimer's brash ode to excess. This fast paced picture packs noisy supercharged action scenes ,thrills, loud pursuits, lot of violence and murders. The wacky police Smith, always on the edge, and his partner the gentle and good father Lawrence again give nice performances with special chemistry between the two actors. They go after and run afoul a nasty villain well played by Jacob Scipio and his stubborn mother, Kate del Castillo. Furthermore, a lot of familiar secondaries appearing, such as: Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig, Charles Melton, Paola Núñez, Theresa Randle, Nicky Jam, and Joe Pantoliano. The violence, blood explosion, car pursuits, and destruction are unmediated. This epic caper features at least one imaginatively choreographed car chase and, as you might expect from Bruckheimer, some impressive effects sequences. Even running time is excessive. Way over the top, the picture is morally off-killer, designed for laddish lunkheads with a thirst for the lowest common denominator. Sequel Bad Boys for Life (2020) follows same formula as the previous installments, though here the detectives are more mature and experienced. Again steady Marcus is a married man and Mike is a lone wolf. As long as as it's taking pot shots and at macho attitudes there's plenty of comic play in this set-up, happily exploited by the charismatic pairing of Smith and Lawrence. Unfortunately, the film is a couple of rewrites short of 'developed' and thriller configurations are stale. The motion picture was professionally directed by Adil El Arbi, Bilall Fallah, though with no originaly, because they copy the main situations of the known franchise.'Bad Boys' trilogy is made up of: ¨Bad Boys¨ (1995) by Michael Bay with Smith, Lawrence, Téa Leoni, Joe Pantoliano, Marg Helgenberger, Nestor Serrano, Julio Oscar Mechoso , Lisa Boyle Michael Imperioli. ¨Bad Boys¨(2003) by Michael Bay with Martin Lawrence, Will Smith, Jordi Mollà, Gabrielle Union, Peter Stormare, Theresa Randle, Joe Pantoliano, Michael Shannon, Jon Seda, Yul Vazquez.

Police Detectives Marcus (Martin Lawrence) and Mike (Will Smith) are two of the Baddest cops, now going through new challenges in life. Marcus has decided to finally retire and someone is out to kill Mike for personal revenge. Marcus and Mike soon join a new elite team within the Miami Police Department known as AMMO. This team, along with Marcus and Mike, are focusing on a new dangerous villain known as Armando Armes from Mexico.If you've seen the previous two Bad Boys films, you'll generally know what to expect- cheeky banter between our leading heroes with bonus action. The difference with this third instalment; however, is we now have a new pair of directors to helm this third instalment. Even with new directors I'm thankful to report that this film feels consistent with what director Michael Bay perhaps would have done with this instalment. It's also respectful to the original two films, even bringing back returning side characters.A main praise point for this film is the fact that there is a greater focus on characters and the furthering of their relationship more than ever before. This film could very easily have been a simple cash grab loaded with brainless action, but it's not just that, it's more. As plot, it's darker than the other two and even manages to surprise the audience with a few twists.Unfortunately, it does feel like there is less action here, but what does happen is mostly enjoyable with the added element that is random comedy. In regards to the action, I was slightly disappointed with a certain chase scene which seem to have been filmed in an odd frame rate, plus it's obvious that there is a higher use of CGI throughout the film.Overall, Bad Boys fans will generally find joy in seeing a further character development along with a few surprises along the way. It's a plot that is next level in their friendship as well as taking on a new threat one last time. Slightly less action than previous film but more plot development than ever before. If you need to switch off from the world for a while? Watcha gonna do? Bad Boys for Life Y'all.7.0/10

"7","/10","Third time really is the charm as the ""Legacy sequel"" to Bad Boys gives us the best incarnation of the franchise yet.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7732537/?ref_=tt_urv","IonicBreezeMachine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117926588/?ref_=tt_urv","8 January 2022","Having recently become a grandfather, Detective Lieutenant Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) contemplates retirement so he can spend his days with his family, while Marcus' friend and partner Detective Lieutenant Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) intends to stay on the force ""until the wheels come off"". When Mike is shot in a drive by shooting he nearly loses his life as Marcus stays by his side praying for his recovery. 6 months later, Mike has recovered and intends to hunt down whoever ordered him killed while Marcus has since retired and initially refuses to re-enter the fray. After pressuring his captain, Conrad Howard (Joe Pantoliano), Conrad reluctantly allows Mike to join the tech based task force AMMO (Advanced Miami Metro Operations) headed by Mike's ex-girlfriend, Rita (Paola Nunez), in a consulting capacity where Mike soon learns the attempt on his life and deaths of several other law enforcement officials are tied to someone from Mike's past.In 1995, audiences were treated to the buddy cop action film Bad Boys which served as the directorial debut for Michael Bay and launched the careers of established TV stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence to film stardom. Audiences were then treated to the belated sequel 8 years later reuniting the Bay, Smith and Lawrence for Bad Boys II which doubled the gross of the first film, but with a production budget 6 times larger than the first one also didn't yield as impressive margins. Discussions had been had about reuniting the team again for a potential Bad Boys III, but budget constraints were an impediment to any meaningful development on the project. Movement was made in 2015 when Smokin' Aces and The A-Team director Joe Carnahan joined the project with the intent of filming both Bad Boys 3 and Bad Boys 4 but after numerous delays, Carnahan also dropped out due to scheduling conflicts and was replaced by up and coming Belgian-Moroccan directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah who had made a name for themselves with their gritty crime films 2015's Black and 2018's Gangsta. After a 17 year Journey the film carries all the over the top energy that captured audiences with the first film, but adds more weight and character that more than elevates above the bloated annoying second film.Adil & Bilall despite being newcomers to the series do a good job of handling the film and making it fit in seamlessly with the established entries in the series while also putting their own stamp on it. While the movie does copy some iconic shots from the first Bad Boys film (I'm sure you can guess which ones), Adil & Bilall have their own eye that makes the film a much more technically polished and accomplished piece of action filmmaking than the series has ever been. This directing duo knows how to frame and film action with a good sense of pacing and build up and establishment of spatial geography so we know where characters are relative to one another and we can fully immerse ourselves in the sequences and appreciate the pyrotechnics and visual artistry that went in to making these scenes so intense and engaging. The climax in Mexico City is a wonderful setpiece, and a sequence in the middle of the movie has some cheeky nods to John Woo where Mike uses a creeper seat in a way that'll be very familiar to those who've seen Hard Boiled.The characters feel like they have a lot more room to breathe this time around as Adil & Bilall keep their running time down to a reasonable 2 hours and keep the film streamlined enough for story beats to push forward while also allowing for the loose feeling from the first movie that allowed Smith and Lawrence to improvise some charming exchanges between each other. Lawrence does well conveying a more aged version of his character who having just become a grandfather is questioning whether he can keep going on with things as they are or retire to spend time with his family. Will Smith is still playing Mike Lowrey with similar arrogance and swagger, but there is a noticeable slowdown that Smith conveys with his character and an added layer that he conceals an added layer of darkness to his character. The revelations about Smith's character in how they relate to the plot are pretty over the top, but the movie seems to be aware they're over the top with scenes such as Marcus watching something in his spare time that does kind of foreshadow the revelation to a degree. The AMMO team I thought was an okay addition as the more tech reliant team contrasts well with the old school approach of Burnett and Lowrey, but aside from Rita I didn't feel like there was much distinction among the other members of AMMO, but there was just enough that I never found them intrusive or annoying.Bad Boys for Life won't convert naysayers of the franchise, but for those who have fond memories of Bad Boys (and to a lesser extent Bad Boys II) this movie will give you what you loved from the first movie with some added polish and style that makes good use of its charismatic talents and generously sized budget. The movie has that level of dynamic action and humor you look for in a movie like this that makes it easy to overlook the ridiculousness of certain elements and go along with them. If this is an indication of what Adil & Bilall have in store for further projects I can't wait to see what they bring to their upcoming Batgirl and Beverley Hills Cop 4 takes.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

A quarter of a century. That is absolutely insane. The first film also happens to be the film that brought Michael Bay into the film making world, for better or for worse. I as excited, albeit a little cautiously optimistic about this latest installment. Its the first to not be directed by Bay but the trailer for this looked funny. Bad Boys For Life turns out to be a fun time, really strengthened by the two leads and their chemistry.
The film follows detectives Mike and Marcus. They are older now and are thinking about family and retirement. Mike does not want to admit that age and retirement is something they should consider but decisions in that matter become prevalent when a new threat emerges. Mike is attacked by a mysterious assassin who immediately becomes a threat to the pair. With the help of a younger police force team named AMMO, the Bad Boys make one last stand.
Side note, I kept thinking ""damn who is that hot chick in AMMO?"" Only after the film was over did I realize it was Vanessa Hudgens, boy she looked different here. Anyways, the film's action set pieces are set up very well. Its not as relentless or nauseating like a Bay film. The plot and writing is not all there and I feel like it could have used a stronger sense off plot third act and onwards. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are typically great in this. The humor and chemistry between the two has not lost a bit and it brings an air of nostalgia .
The truth is, the two characters are growing up and its nice to see the two deal with these changes that comes with aging. They aren't who they used to be but boy do they come damn close with all the action involved. This is a surprisingly entertaining time at the movies, which is the best you can hope for. There's been some bad stuff out in January 2020 but finally I see something that lives it up. Bad Boys for Life.

Sure it might be predictable at times but that's what makes it fun and pair that with some comedic offerings from the two stars, its even more enjoyable. Not many big explosions this time because of no bay, but the two directors making their debut did really well and made and enjoyable movie.

That's primarily because the movie actually brings some emotion and character development into the fray, making for a much more personal and easy-to-engage-with experience overall. You actually care about the protagonists this time around and they both undergo their own individual arcs (though Lawrence's is frustratingly undercut in favour of Smith's). The first hour of the flick is actually rather unconventional, taking its time to set up exactly why we should care about its central 'investigation' (in stark contrast to its predecessors). The plot, in general, is less complicated this time; there's no confusion about what's going on, which makes for a much more compelling picture overall. There are also plenty of relatively subtle call-backs and cameos (including a rather bizarre appearance by former series helmsman Michael Bay) that even I - someone who thinks the first film is alright and the second film is terrible - found amusing, so fans of the franchise should be in their element. After about an hour, things slip back into slightly more generic territory as the narrative starts to hit the beats you'd expect it to. However, this segment is enjoyable despite being fairly generic. It features more than one exciting action sequence and, generally speaking, moves at a fairly fast pace. The wider experience just feels as though its heart is in the right place. There isn't really any uncomfortable sexualisation, misogyny or homophobia. Plus, the picture has a much more, shall we say, modern approach to its 'macho' undertones. It's not a fantastic film, don't get me wrong. It still falls into the trappings of its genre and it isn't the most gripping affair, either. However, it's a solid action-comedy (it's actually rather funny in places) that should keep you entertained throughout. 6/10.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Comedy and over the top gore ususally works in horror comedies like ash vs evil but adding it to Bad Boys in such a big volume was a weird design choice. There is absolutetly no consequencea to characters actions and story resolution was rather silly and post credit scene really daft. People who saw the movie will know what I mean. How one could redeemed after this rampage and killing such a important character. This remains a mystery even to the movie producers. Who signed off on this?

Although the two brothers can't escape the years, Martin Lawrence is a little fat and evil. The brothers who originally called brothers and brothers have a gap in their senses. The film still continues the previous style, popcorn + teasing routine. Because of the change of directors, there is no such thing as the best in action scenes. It may also be that the director plans to use more obscure ways to highlight the material of the two brothers' ages. The film as a whole is still quite smooth, without delaying the plot or showing off the feelings. Some of the continued roles are still the original cast, and the details of the casting are still commendable.If there is a problem, there must still be some. You said that the special operations team was out and helped the brothers to arrest the criminals. I understand that after all, it's been a dozen years. But I think this son of Smith is quite brutal. I used to kill my father for not killing my eyes, but I didn't want to hurt the innocent; when I finally knew that my father was born, I fell away at once. The power of abilities really makes the whole show look bloody. Smith's romantic and suspicious appearance in this play as an illegitimate child makes me really unacceptable. Although he is older, his figure is still online, and he has never shown his longing for his family and children in front of the entire film. He should still be as good as the first two films, swaying the nightclub, and it will also be lawless. The image of men at home forms a strong contrast.As a movie fan, you can see the continuation of the Jedi police is still satisfied. Although it does not support the behavior of fried rice, every ip that can keep you in mind is also a memory of your youth. The ip are growing and we are also on the road of time Moving forward...","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Welcome to Miami... again.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5538932/?ref_=tt_urv","bob-the-movie-man","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur49208568/?ref_=tt_urv","9 March 2020","Will Smith seems to have been having a lacklustre period in his career. His genie from ""Aladdin"" got a rather lukewarm reception. And his last movie - ""Gemini Man"" - billed as a big summer blockbuster - failed to impress. True it wasn't a commercial disaster (raking in at the time of writing about 150% of budget), but it's still a film on a plane for me that, even if I'm bored, I'll say ""nah"" to.Perhaps it's for this reason that Smith reached for an old and reliable property to dust off for another outing.And, do you know, it's not half bad.I only recently saw this one, right at the end of its UK cinema run, because frankly it appealed to me like being hit round the head with a cold fish. Martin Lawrence is an actor who just grates on me enormously. I'm sure he's a lovely chap; kind to animals; donates to charity; etc - but I generally just don't find him funny. (Here though he has a killer line about condom use that made me chuckle.) It feels to me like he is on implausible ground here re-treading the role of aging detective Marcus Burnett. One look at Burnett lumbering along and you would think ""well, he'd never pass the medical"" for the on-street role he's portrayed doing. His buddy is detective Mike Lowrey (Will Smith), who has a sordid past that is set to catch up on him.Since we start the story in Colombia, where Isabel Aretas (Kate Del Castillo), the witchy wife of a notorious deceased drug baron, is sprung from prison by her son Armando (Jacob Scipio) in what I admit is a clever and novel way. The Aretas family is bent on revenge - - and a key target in their sites is Lowrey.Burnett is newly a grandparent and hell-bent on retirement. But with Lowrey and his associates with a target on their backs, will there be one last chance to ""Ride Together, Die Together""?Not seen the first two movies? Not to worry! There are movies, like LOTR, where if you've missed the first two movies in the series you will be left in serious ""WTF"" territory in trying to watch the third. This is not one of those movies. The story is entirely self-contained, and refers to events never seen prior to the first film in the series.But whether the movie is for you will depend on your tolerance for loud and brash visuals and music with the knob turned up to 12. Directors Adil and Bilall (Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah - Belgian film school buddies best known for the critically acclaimed 2015 feature ""Black"") - don't do anything by halves.There is a scene in ""Lost Series 3"" in which Sawyer, Kate, and Alex have to bust young Karl out of the mysterious room 23 where he is being tortured by having his eyes kept open while watching a collage of images continually smashed into his eyeballs. This movie feels a little like that after a while.This is not by any means a criticism that it's poorly done. There is some truly stunning cinematography of the Miami skyline by Belgian cinematographer Robrecht Heyvaert, including a 'pull-back' drone shot from a conversation on the top of a building that is quite AWESOME! And there are more than enough ""fast action - then slo-mo - then fast again"" shots to keep music-video junkies happy!The music score by Lorne Balfe is also pumping, adding a dynamism to the frantic action scenes that keeps you entertained.The screenplay by Chris Bremner, Peter Craig and Joe Carnahan is assuredly familiar: it's not going to win any prizes for originality. We've seen the cartel/revenge plotline played out in multiple movies over the years. And we've also seen the ""buddy cops with aging partner taking retirement"" angle from the ""Lethal Weapon"" series. This just sticks them together.Will Smith and Martin Lawrence wise-crack their way through the comedy well-enough, though for me it never reaches the heights of the pairing of Smith and Tommy Lee Jones from MiB (or indeed Mel Gibson and Danny Glover from Lethal Weapon). Elsewhere we have Vanessa Hudgens as a cute cop, still trying to break through from ""Disneyfication"" into mainstream flicks. For one horrible moment, when I saw her name on the cast, I thought she might be the love interest to Smith. But no. That honour goes to Mexican beauty Paola Nuñez who, with only a 10 year age gap, becomes a less gag-worthy pairing. She plays a female leadership role (every 20's film now needs one) as the head of a new crime division.Also good value is Joe Pantoliano reprising his role as Captain Howard - Lowrie's exasperated boss. Playing it by the numbers, every film like this has to have one!Where the plot does add some interest is in a surprising scene mid-film and a twist that I didn't see coming. But this twist felt - in the context of the release date or the film - like a mistake (a ""Spoiler Section"" in my review on the One Mann's Movies web site discusses this).All of this happens of course against a backdrop of a body count of bad guys being killed in ever more graphic and gory ways, while the good guys generally dodge every bullet, grenade and crashing helicopter heading their way.It's that time of year when films are released to die. Where studios drop their movies that are never going to trouble the Academy and are not deemed worthy of summer or even late spring release. But they should have had more faith in this one, for it's not half bad. True, you may need a couple of paracetamols afterwards, but if your corneas and ear-drums can stand the pace, its not short on entertainment value.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Between the end of the 90's and the beginning of the 2000's Badboys 1 and 2 made laugh a lot of people. Movies had amazing action sequences and good comedic moments. After more than 10 years since then,they released a new chapter, that was completely unexpected. Jokes are not particularly funny or original, but some of them made me laugh. Will Smith clearly dominate most of scenes. Martin Lawrence cannot reach his level, and this makes him more like a side character. In previous movies was definitely better. As for the rest of the cast, I cannot say that I am impressed, most of them are actors that I have never seen on my life, except for Vanessa Hudgens, and a few cameos such as The Weeknd and DJ Khaled.Action scenes are overall good, but I cannot say the same about the special effects. From a production of this size, I was expecting more. Especially towards the end, you can actually see how poor animations are made. I have watched indie movies, that have a smaller budget than this one; and have better visual effects. However action scenes are very well conceived and extremely dynamic. Extra points for camera shots.The story is uninspired. Writers could came up with something different, but they decided to play safe and go for an overused narrative scheme, already seen on cinema many, many times. Overall is a decent movie that manages to entertain for a couple of hours. Soundtrack is nice and it fits perfectly on every situation. For sure the worst movie of the trilogy, but not so bad as many people thinks. I personally enjoyed it a lot.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

For this movie although, the plot is actually above average and might surprise you. That said, it is imperative that you watch the previous 2 movies if you're critical on character development, plot direction, transitions etc. Beware that some scenes might feel a bit slow and may hinder your experience.Execution: 7 - 7.5, considering the plot, the directors did a pretty good job. For a threequel expected to fail below expectations due to a 17 year gap from the previous movie, the execution of the story truly stood out. From the comedic timing, sub amazing/cringeworthy fights, and dramatic conflicts over material objects. This movie definitely deserves a watch.Acting: 6.5 - 7.5, nothing special, above average at best. If you were expecting a monologue filled with vivid imagery and verbosity this ain't it chief. Most of the dialogue/facial expressions were based on comedy, as expected. Hence why no specific scene was truly memorable. Only actor that did stand out a little bit was Joe Pantoliano (Captain).Music score: 8 - 8.5, some great bangers with the music choice, beware you may burst into a sing-a-long.Action: 7.5 - 8, not mind boggling or exceptional but very good nonetheless, the use of guns, explosives, and raw power all serve a beautiful purpose, which is enjoyment. The fight choreography is a bit iffy but works.Comedy: 8 - 8.5, will you laugh? yes, will you cringe? maybe, is it worth watching the movie if you're into comedy based pieces? yes.... to an extent.

It doesnt take a lot for me to be entertained (note: favourite movie ever is Heat, followed by the Godfathers 1 and 2) and i can really enjoy some popcorn entertainment, provided its well made. Like Armageddon or so... or Midway.But this? This was just horrible. Honestly, the first hour was promising. Great filming, not so bad acting, and quite some well made action sequences.But then something weird happened, exactly after one hour. It was as if the whole movie changed at 60 mins. Another director, new producer, new script and .............. no more fx budget.It was just SO weird. We were entertained, had a great night and than.......uhm, yeah what? I can hardly explain how much the 2nd hour differs from the first. Its pathetic and mindblowing.Normaly I would say do NOT watch this, given it a 1. But now I say: go watch it, and be amazed how a movie can be ruined after a nice start.Horrible.

The supporting cast are ok, although most aren't used much, and although Will Smith doesn't quite pull off the emotional gravitas the finale requires, it's a fun and enjoyable film.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

In addition, to a great performance by Martin Lawrence who was the MVP in my opinion, all these points are the positives. Now, let's talk about the negatives, first of all, this movie has too many plot twists that feels very inserted into the story just to avoid the possibility of its pointlessness. In addition, why did they add a witch to the story?, seriously this feels really pointless. I mean, I like the addition of the Teen Team, but other than that not very much.

Isabel has a secret weapon with son Armando, played by Jacob Scipio, ready to party in Miami like there's no tomorrow. For those on the hit list! But two old cops are limbering up for the fight. Right to the hospital, as Martin Lawrence's Marcus becomes a granddad, and fancies life in the slow lane of retirement. While his partner, Will Smith's Mike, wants to see more miles on the Porsche before he's ready to settle down and call it a day.Directors Adil El Arbi & Bilall Fallah have created a really funny cop film with Bad Boys For Life. I didn't see the two previous but I'm guessing they follow the same pattern.Isabel now suited and booted in Victoria Beckham designer gear gives Armano, let's call him Junior for now, the hit list. And Mike just happens to be on it. But instructed to kill him last. Of course Junior has a will of his own, he quite happily finishes off the local drugs lord, his family is in charge again now that Isabel is back. And Mike is taken out too. Not exactly in the right order, so Isabel is pissed.While he's is in the Twilight Zone Marcus prays that if Mike makes it he will hang up his holster for good. A vow he makes good on, and spends his days getting in his wife's way and blowing things up! He's up to date on the soaps, but people are still getting killed out there. And Mike back in the Porsche is trying to figure out who the sharp shooter in black is, and who will be next. When he discovers a lead, Joe Pantoliano's Miami PD Captain Howard lets him sit in on a gig run by Paola Nuñez's Rita. Mike's previous girlfriend on the force, and there's no love lost. She has a crack team of newbies including Charles Melton, Vanessa Hudgens and Alexander Ludwig. The first not impressed by Mike and the last totally intimidated by him. He's built like a tank but has anger issues so does the nerdy computer stuff. Their team codename is AMMO, although occasionally they use plastic bullets. Not very rock and roll. And although he's an 'adviser' to the team. Mike sometimes has to make executive decisions. That guy will really get himself killed. With Howard suggesting he like Marcus might think about retiring soon too. Marcus needs glasses and Mike dyes his goatee for heaven's sake! But there's still life in the old dogs yet and when the shooter gets too close to home, they are ready to saddle up one last time. Motorbike and sidecar style. With a big dog!It's a terrifically funny script by Chris Bremner, Joe Carnahan and Peter Craig, with plenty of firepower and heat. Miami is a riot of colour with cinematography by Robrecht Heyvaert and the non stop action directed by Adil & Bilall never lets up. It was totally not what I was expecting and I had a blast. Will and Martin still got it.","36 out of 63 found this helpful.

First two movies were not taking themselves seriously and have very cliche villians. And Bad boys for life's best addition to series is its villian. Villian in this movie is not so cliche like the first two and this situation brings some kind seriousness to the movie. Seriousness can be considered a good aspect of the movie because character are older now so it very fits the story.
If you like first two movies then you should watch this one too but I think 2nd movie still the best one in the series and shooting 4th movie is unecessary. Probably they continue it with characters included in 3rd movie but trilogy should be for the series.

""Bad Boys for Life"" brings back our favorite detectives, Marcus and Mike, in a surprising third installment with admirable production values.It's the darkest film of the series yet which helps to make the stakes feel as real as they can be for a Bad Boys installment, though it makes for an uneven tone. There are early scenes with the main antagonists that can be redundant, and the movie will obviously require some suspension of disbelief. This is all balanced out with gritty and entertaining action sequences. The chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence doesn't miss a beat, and the new cast members (especially the AMMO team, new allies for Marcus and Mike) are also fun to watch.Major movie releases in the winter have been known a lot to be average or bad at best, but for me and others ""Bad Boys for Life"" was a surprisingly fun time to start out 2020.

This film is directed by the duo Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, who have also directed the films Black and Patsers.In the film, the detective duo Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) are again investigating murder cases, where the victims seem to have something in common. Among the victims are also some people who knew Mike and Marcus personally. During their investigation, the two realize that they are no longer the young detective duo as they used to be. For this reason, she is advised to collaborate with the new younger ANMO elite team consisting of Miami police officers. Together with this team, the two have to unravel the connection between the murder cases and stop the perpetrator. The two must now also take into account their older age and try to keep their ego under control.The two previous Bad Boys films were directed by Michael Bay, who gave his own sometimes somewhat exaggerated action to the films. For example, he made sure that the action scenes seemed a little more energetic. Michael Bay does have a cameo in this film, but is otherwise separate from it. Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah have portrayed this film in a somewhat quieter way, but still manage to fill the film well with entertaining action scenes. The quieter way in which they present the action in the film also fits with the older characters. For example, they have made this film entertaining for fans of the film series.That this film is only their first international action film for the directing duo is unfortunately reflected in the technical field, because the transition between the actors and their stunt doubles can sometimes be seen. You can also see when a green screen was used in some explosive action scenes.The film is also supported by the returned duo of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. The two together still have good chemistry as friendly partners who sometimes ridicule each other with their personal problems. Will Smith also comes across as he did in the older films. This was before Will Smith was a big Hollywood star and he really went to great lengths for his film roles Martin Lawrence had already retired as an actor for this film and only played small roles or acted more in TV series. It is nice to see him again in a real role. The rest of the cast also provides good and appropriate acting. The actors of the new police team put down their roles well without overshadowing the two main characters, which happened in the third Expendables film, for example.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film stars Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig, Paola Núñez, Charles Melton, Kate del Castillo, Nicky Jam, and Joe PantolianoIt is the sequel to Bad Boys II (2003) and the third installment in the Bad Boys franchise.Detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett join the Miami Police Department's special team AMMO to bring down the ruthless Armando, who is on a mission to kill Mike at his mother Isabel's orders.Trust me the film is not very disappointing, the film might not be as entertaining as it's previous two parts but still the film entertains in his own way and the film has it's own demerits but still makes the film a decent one time watch.The plot of the film is half baked and the execution is passable. The only savior of the film is probably the duo of Will and Martin as the new characters doesn't excites much. The villain of the film also doesn't looks that impressive.As far as acting is concerned apart from the iconic duo of Will and Martin none of the character looked impressive and many of the jokes also looked forced upon. The screenplay of the film is fast paced but is predictable and cliched. The only twist of the film also doesn't excites much.BGM of the film is loud and VFX is good, the car chase scenes were impressive. The climax of the film is little bit above average but doesn't disappoints much.Despite of the demerits of the film the iconic duo of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence makes this film a decent one time watch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's not as good as the first two but after twenty years, what else would you except. Will Smith is fine but this movie (all three of them actually) belongs to Martin Lawrence. Lawrence is very likeable, and very funny, in ""Bad Boys for Life"". The script for this movie isn't as sharp as the first two so Lawrence's material takes a dip every now and then but he manages to build up such goodwill that any minor stumble is quickly forgiven. Will Smith's weaker moments are more distracting. After Smith's career killing slap at the 2022 Oscars, whatever appeal he still had is all but erased. All that said, I liked ""Bad Boys for Life"" and I hope they make another movie.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"6","/10","It's surprisingly okay","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5624340/?ref_=tt_urv","MovieWarfare","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112855274/?ref_=tt_urv","10 April 2020","Bad Boys was the film that pretty much launched Will Smith into action fame. The first two films which were directed by Michael Bay were the most Michael Bayest film ever. Both films had cringe dialogue with fart jokes, sex jokes, and treating women like objects with the dumbest and pervert camera shots for women with lots of explosions. Also an incredible amount of F-bombs. Honestly, the Bad Boys movies suck a lot and it baffles me that it managed to even get a third movie. However, this time it isn't directed by Michael Bay and that was enough to get me interested in this movie.25 years after the first movie I got to say that Will and Martin still have great chemistry and their banter is still one of the biggest highlights for this movie. I was worried about this as Martin Lawrence hasn't been in a lot of films but this movie shows that they still got it. Additionally, the movie makes their characters have more depth instead of being loud over the top cops and that was very interesting. The action scenes also have a lot less shaky cam which makes it so much easier to know what is going on compared to the previous films. The movie also does comedy much better than the first two movies with moments that actually gave me a chuckle. There are still some sex jokes but  and fart jokes are gladly gone. Also, the story is actually a lot more compelling compared the first two movies by making it feel more personal instead of ""hot girl gets kidnap by a bad person"". On that note, the villain is more memorable as it feels like they have a personality and has a believable motive instead of being a generic 80s cannon fodder. The stakes in these movies feel high and more important to the characters.However, this movie feels very generic and conventional and doesn't really add anything to the action genre. It's just a typical action movie that is not as terrible as the first two. The action scenes while much more visible, lack a lot of the high octane energy from Michael Bay movies. I hate the first two movies but there is some pretty crazy action in them such as the freeway scene in Bad Boys 2 but in this movie, they are just really tame. Furthermore, the movie also has a surprising amount of blatant CGI and green screen which are very noticeable in action scenes. It's very obvious when they green-screened a stunt double with Will Smith's face or Martin's face and it can take you out the movie sometimes. Finally, without spoiling the story, there is just one moment near the end of the movie that really irritates me when a character makes a choice that makes no sense as there was no proper build-up to it. It just happens and it doesn't feel deserved or believable.In conclusion, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. However, the franchise is still quite bad in my opinion and this movie doesn't make me change my mind. Maybe the 4th movie which should be called Bad Boys 4ever steps up the plate and takes more risk.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Saw it the first two nights it came out the 16th and 17th last week. As a fan of the series it was great just seeing Will and Martin back again but the plot holes couldn't be ignored. Remember this series runs in real time, as seen in 2 with mentions of 9/11. 4 issues listed here from worse to least. Also, HOW TF did the bad guy keep popping up at the exact places our Cop Duo is, without using any trackers, spies or even tv cameras or social media postings?!?1) TIMELINE - The whole ""start"" / reason for the plot is based on events that take place 1 year BEFORE Marcus and Mike become partners. Biggest plot hole here. In 3, the plot is said to start in 1995, 8 months before Isabel's son, the assassin is born in 1996 as shown in the movie. Problem is Bad Boys 1 was in 1995 and after the pool fight Mike tells Marcus ""I've been your partner for 6 years and I've been your boy all my life"". This means they've been partners since 1989 at least. *** Don't give the fans a timeline and dates to follow in 3, if you're gonna completely ignore the series foundation plot and timeline events. ***2) MISSING CHARACTERS - A few characters should have been in this movie but were left out with no explanation or mention of : a) Fletcher - Computer Hacker from 1 & 2, should have been in A.M.M.O. for 3. b) Sinclair - Internal Affairs Officer in 1, The Judge in 2 (mentioned but not seen) ""Judge Sinclair signed the warrants"" ""You just love missing Capt. Howard off don't you?"" These 2 should have been in the 3rd one especially Sinclair. KEY missed character there. It should have been Sinclair to have been the glue / rally call to give the duo motivation to catch the assassin. (Much like how Capt. Howard tells them in 1, ""Do what you do, only faster!"" ""I'm always taking it for you right? Do it for me!"" and ""it's time to get lucky, go do what you gotta do"" There was room for a surprise reappearance from a character in 3 for comedy value but not for plot value.3) REALISM - 1 & 2 have been keeping this realistic to a point but 3, goes left field more so with the very last scene in prison. Telling the assassin ""an opportunity has presented itself for you to knock off some of that debt"" . There is NO WAY possible to knock off multiple life sentences without parole, for killing a Judge,a lawyer, multiple cops and civilians. (yes it's just a movie but with realistic boundaries at least it was in this series) This is impossible in this day and age. ** This isn't the first time we've seen such in Hollywood, recent example F&F Jason Statham's character, but another story as F&F stopped being realistic after the first one.** Also opening chase scene was entertaining but plot wise dumb, reckless and would not have happened. Mike and Marcus have been chewed out for much less.4) BREAKING THE 4th WALL - In 3, this was done with overkill. I don't know how many times ""Bad Boys"" was mentioned within the movie itself.

Still, there are other obvious characteristics of these films: they always have a bad antagonist, color saturation, shooting and the famous 360° turn of the hero. Now, with Bad Boys For Life, a constant for the worse is the reiteration that twenty-five years have passed since the first Bad Boys, therefore our protagonists are older, and in the film they make this clear again and again and in different ways. Shapes. Which means that although they want to be aware of the time that has passed, it also means that the iconic Bad Boys cannot be fully enjoyed.The antagonists this time are written with the full intention of giving them greater depth to the past, it is a shame that they both fall into stereotypes and to top it off they are not at all interesting just like the villains of Bad Boys 1 and 2. This part, as seen has said, they wanted to give it more importance and something with which the protagonists could feel more related and are not just the bad guys in turn, because as expected everything reaches a conclusion where the third act is without a doubt the worst of all three films being incongruous and conventional.The biggest intrigue is perhaps, Bad Boys being a Michael Bay project, how much style did the film maintain? Did the quality improve with Bay out of the Director's chair? Bad Boys is one of Bay's best films. And his style is part of the franchise, that would be the answer.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

'Bad Boys for Life' is an action-comedy film directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah. It is the third installment in the 'Bad Boys' franchise. The film follows detectives Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) reuniting once again when someone starts murdering people involved in an old case.
I enjoy a lot with the 'Bad Boys' movies. They're not well loved by critics, but audience viewers seem to enjoy them, and I was excited to see this one. It's not like the first two films at all and seems to settle down and take itself more seriously and I loved it even more for it.
Will Smith and Martin Lawrence don't skip a beat coming back to these characters after over 15 years on hiatus. The embodied the characters perfectly, yet still mange to show character growth from when we last seen them in 'Bad Boys II'. I was unsure going into it with the younger police officers played by Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig and Charles Melton, but it brought something that I think was needed to the story, and all three did a great job as well.
This is my favorite film in the franchise and it's mainly because it had the most focused story. From beginning to end it knows what it wants to be, and it doesn't get jumbled in between genres as I find the other films to do. It's comedy lands when it needs to, and the action sequences are fantastic.
Overall, I know we are still in the beginning of 2020, but this film has a real chance of making my to ten favorite films of year. It's a giant adrenaline rush with lots of laughs, and some unexpected twists along the way.

This might even be the best of the three instalments, and I left the movie feeling satisfied. If you want leave your brain on standby and watch some fun action look no further, this is great from that perspective.But this is not a very good movie and I cannot allow myself to give it a better score than 6/10. I would like to, but this is has too many problems and lack too much in script, directing and story telling that 6/10 is actually generous.I would put this movie in the same category as Demolition Man and Commando (continuing the 80's and 90's references) - pretty bad movies but still guilty pleasure and fun to watch.Do not expect too much, leave your brain at the door, buy some popcorn and sit down and enjoy.

However the this movie took its own time of almost 50 minutes to get hold of me. From there on the whole movie feels like its everything we deserve from the franchise. Thing to be praised in the movie is how they adapted the buddy cops to the modern era. Followed by the intense action sequences and twists which were a surprise delight as they happened late in the movie. Although it is set in a colorful tone, the movie never forgets its darker elements that are provided by the mysterious mom and her son. As usual Will Smith and Martin Lawrence deliver the bad boys as expected. Last but not the least the cinematography of the climax fight adds to the biggest delight of the movie.Coming to con, the movie takes its own time to become engaging while the action sequences went a little over the park as the movie progressed which was kind of weird but adaptable.Bad Boys succeeds in entertaining yet again as its bigger, better and enjoyable.Rating:69%","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, the film injects new energy into the franchise while staying true to its roots.The plot centers around Mike and Marcus facing a formidable new enemy, forcing them to confront their pasts and the toll that years of police work have taken on them. The chemistry between Smith and Lawrence remains a highlight, with their banter and camaraderie providing both laughs and heartfelt moments.The action sequences are well-executed, featuring high-octane chases and intense shootouts. However, the film's pacing occasionally stumbles, with some scenes feeling drawn out. The addition of a younger team of cops adds a modern twist but sometimes shifts focus away from the main duo.""Bad Boys for Life"" succeeds in delivering a fun and engaging ride, even if it doesn't break new ground.

Will Smith had zero chemistry with his supposed love interest and every scene they shared just didn't work.
Writers completely turned the previous idea on its head, shook it about and threw it in a wood chipper and by changing the Bad Boys formula it just didn't work, putting Martin Lawrence in retirement for near enough the whole film and the addition of AMMO unit was just weird and unnecessary. It really was reminiscent of 21 Jump Street but without the comedy. Action wise jumping on to helicopter rope ladders and riding motorcycle sidecars with built in machine guns is something out of a 70s Bond film (it's been done). It's almost as though they're trying to make a Fast & Furious franchise when a standard, well made sequel that stuck to the original bad boys idea was what I wanted.Martin Lawrence delivers a few funny lines, Vanessa Hudgens Looks stunning. Other than that it was just your standard B movie directed by Paul WS Anderson.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

.
In this action film, Mike and Marcus join a new elite team in order to take down a ruthless drug cartel.
.
Even though we were introduced to these characters 25 years ago (I feel very old), the same energy and electricity is there. If anything Mike and Marcus age like fine wine. The one thing that turned me off was all the CGI in the action sequences; I miss the days of stunt men/women and real explosions. Aside from that ""Bad Boys For Life"" has tons of action, laughs and huge revelations. The most important part of this film is the chemistry between Smith and Lawrence and that is definitely not lost.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The premise of the film sees a hitman go after the cop duo which forces them to reunite and hit the streets again.Main Character
Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back together again and they haven't lost a touch, in fact this may be their best performances yet in this franchise. The film focuses more on Smith this time but it really works he is still the cocky but loveable police detective that you want to root for but in this film he really has to deal with some dramatic things and he does it really well and makes him a better all round main character. Lawrence is in a different place as a character but it also works for this film, there is a clear difference between the two characters in this film and it allows them to explore their friendship in greater detail. Also their chemistry together is once again really strong and it will keep you highly entertained throughout this exciting film.Supporting Characters
Joe Pantoliano is back as the captain and he is actually given more screen time in this film and he is just really funny in this film, he is a great addition to this franchise and fits in excellently with the two leads of the film. But this film tries to add a group of new characters including Vanessa Hudgens and they just aren't interesting at all, they just feel like a roadblock to our main characters and it feels like they were just added to get some younger actors to be in some of the action scenes. Also, even though the motivations for the villains were fine the characters weren't particularly interesting and they weren't that compelling.Story
In previous Bad Boys films the villains motivations have been very basic, but credit to this film that it tires to give the villains a reason for going against our main characters and I thought it was handled pretty well. Smith's journey throughout the film is also well handled and his character evolves as the film progresses which I would argue hasn't happened in the previous films. However, the last act is pretty cliche and by the numbers, it is a shame as the film tries but falls into a pretty basic conclusion that isn't that interesting.Script
The script is actually really good in this film, the humour is there like the previous films, it had me laughing throughout. But what suprised me in particular was how well the drama was handled in this film, in previous Bad Boys reviews I always criticised the lack of drama but that is not a complaint in this film and I feel like this film has a great blend of humour and drama.Style
This film has really exciting and hard hitting action scenes, the films hand to hand combat is the best in the franchise and Will Smith delivers even when he is around the 50 years old range. You will be entertained as things explode and go a bit crazy for our characters, but for some reason this film felt much longer then it actually is. The action scenes sometimes go on for a bit long and the film's pacing does make the film drag a bit.Overall
Overall this is a really fun film, I would argue it is the best Bad Boys film yet but it is just a good action film and nothing special, though if you are looking for a fun action film to watch then Bad Boys For Life is a good film to watch.Rating - 7/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is the sequel to Bad Boys II and the third installment in the Bad Boys franchise. With Will Smith and Martin Lawrence reprising their iconic roles and they're joined by Paola Núñez, Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig, Joe Pantoliano, Charles Melton, Kate del Castillo and Nicky Jam. The film was written by Chris Bremner, Peter Craig and Joe Carnahan. The latter two whom wrote the film is two great writers, the work they did on the screenplay and story is great. I think the characters are well written this time around and their story ideas are fantastic for the Bad Boys franchise, AMMO is also quite great and fitting for the movie of our more aged detectives, with each member of AMMO distinct from each other and some are more interesting than others but the characters do the job.Miami detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett must face off against a mother-and-son pair of drug lords who wreak vengeful havoc on their city.Did I miss Michael Bay in the director chair? The man who brought the first two films to the big screen, mostly no because of how I don't think he would have done a third film justice. Meanwhile Adil & Bilall does something different, something unique, but yet familiar. It's more personal and realistic in a way, like this quote Burnett is telling Lowrey ""You're human, just like the rest of us"" and it summarizes the film in a way, in how these characters are human beings and not really the action heroes we know them as. Adil & Bilall created some truly great and memorable action sequences, their visual storytelling is also on point. Whilst Michael Bay wanted to outdo himself with doing bigger and more explosive whilst keeping the comedic moments going. Most of the comedic moments in Bad Boys for Life feel more natural, the banter between Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett is still amazing. I also think the performances of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence were excellent, might be the best in the franchise, but I also want to praise Kate del Castillo as Isabel 'La Bruja' Aretas, Paola Núñez as Lieutenant Rita Secada and Jacob Scipio as Armando Aretas, they were great. I also liked the editing and Lorne Balfe's musical score was fitting and overall quite great.Though I loved Adil & Bilall's film, I would have liked to see what Michael Bay would have brought to the screen, it would have been different but probably an extremely entertaining film. Bad Boys for Life is a worthy sequel and is a well thought-out sequel that's both impressive and enjoyable, good at both the drama side and the action side.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

But...as life would have it...I ended up attending this film - with a giant attitude of ""this is gonna stink"" to accompany me.And...I was wrong. I was really, really entertained by this film.BAD BOYS FOR LIFE presents Martin Lawrence's Det. Marcus Burnett and Will Smith's Det. Mike Lowry still ""in the game"". One wants to keep working and the other is looking to retire (if you take a look at the picture, you can figure out which one is which). The two battle like an old married couple while taking on some crooks in ""shoot 'em up"" action scenes.And...what's not to like about that? Smith and Lawrence still have strong chemistry on the screen and the action scenes - staged by new (to me) Directors Adil and Bilall - keep things moving at a quick enough pace, not too fast that you get a headache, but not too slow that you start punching a hole in the plot.And...as is typical of these types of films...the plot is paper thin and just is a reason to have these 2 banter and to have shoot-em-up scenes.But that doesn't matter.Ably helping the boys out is their put-upon Captain (the always watchable Joe Pantaliano reprising his role from the previous 2 films) and the members of the ""AMMO SQUAD"". These are young cops who are set up to replace our 2 heroes. Normally, this band of youngsters would be arrogant a-holes who end up being too cocky and are outwitted by our heroes, but this film puts that convention on it's ear and the ""Ammo Squad"" are actually a pretty good addition to this film series.The filmmakers left the door wide open for BAD BOYS 4 and...I can't believe I'm saying this...I'm actually looking forward to it! Certainly not an Oscar contender, but an entertaining ""blow-em-up"" with 2 charismatic leads that play off each other well. Everyone involved knew exactly what type of film they were making - so they made that movie, with no apologies.Letter Grade: a solid B7 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film has got everything The Humor, Action, Emotions etc. starting from Miami and ending at Mexico the plot twist landed perfectly as audience might not anticipate it. Camerawork, editing and background music everything contributes to make this film very much watchable and enjoyable just like any Masala Bollywood Movie. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith's chemistry is as usual a LIT their onscreen love and hate relationship yet brothers for life just brings old memories back.
The only thing which felt incomplete was the AMMO team lead by Rita Secada played by the gorgeous Paola Núñez as this team gave the flavor of modernize tools and techniques and provided their support to the Old Dogs of the game but really it would have been a delight to see some street fights from AMMO team especially from Venessa Hudgens & Paola Núñez herself but sadly it didn't happen but nevertheless the film is entertaining and for Bad Boys lovers it is a must watch as this might be the last installment from this franchise.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I remember seeing the news for Bad Boys 2 and being concerned because it had been a while since the first and the first was a GREAT action film. Needless to say, the upped the comedy and the action and delivered a good, solid action film again. When the third was announced, I was happy. Sure, I didn't need a third but - they got the second one right so they could get this one right too?No.The comedy wears thin, the editing (last fight scene) is so sloppy it's hard to tell what is going on. They followed Blade 3's idea of allowing a younger ""team"" into the picture too (and we know how well that worked out for the Blade franchise) and the writing is downright lazy and laughable (not in a good way). When you get to ""the"" reveal, you WILL roll your eyes.The directing captured the madness of the first two films but - other than that - this was just a cheap, ugly mess of a cash in and for why?!

And though both Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are both starting to/blatantly showing their age, they don't hide it, they celebrate it!One of the earlier scenes involves a footrace between Mike and Marcus and it very much like a Parent/Teacher race on a child's sports day, with Martin Lawrence being the slightly out of shape teacher who refuses to be beaten by the parent(honestly cannot think who that would be!) and Will Smith, the still physically active parent who is starting to loss their natural fitness but could still have a good run around on a Sunday League Football Game but is not willing to admit they can't beat a twenty -something to the ball, so is breathing out of their butt!Anyway, I digress(as usual), I'm not going to go into the whys and wherefores of the story, suffice to say just as with Bad Boys(Mike's Friend) and Bad Boys II(Marcus' sister), the problem revolves around the boys/men/near retirees personal life and involves people being out to get them.Will Smith is definitely back to best playing these action roles and this is one of his most beloved characters, he still has the swagger and the fun and adds his trademark emotional connection to the role. Martin Lawrence, though slightly looking like the eyeball guy from Britain's Got Talent and a bit like a chipmunk, retains some of the best lines and adds the anchor to Mike's exuberance.He also has one of the best comedy moments I've seen in a long long time, involving the aftermath of a rubber bullet. I was crying in the cinema with laughter. Joe Pantoliano is back as Captain Howard and has a lot more to do in this film than previously and provides some of the most funnily exasperated lines as well as one the films stand out emotional moments.They are joined by a new team, Paolo Nunez as Mike's ex-love interest/Police Lieutenant/ boss Rita, Vanessa Hudgens as girl with a gun Kelly(starting to develop her action skills and branch out from her usual roles), Alexander Ludwig as Dorn, the hard as nails, soft at heart tech guy and Charles Melton, with muscles and an ego to give Mike a run for his money. These four works very well together as a team and are a great addition to the Bad Boys.The Bad Boys song makes several appearances and each one is its own moment of little Gold, including Good Men (definitely catchy!).Bad Boys for Life is as good the first two films and does exactly what you want from a Will Smith action movie. It is a perfect Saturday night watch. And both me and Shell agree that is was the best film we've seen at the cinema for a long while and are happy that it has done well enough for Bad Boys 4 to be in the works already.Bad boys bad boys

Popcorn flicks are 9 times out of 10 cookie cutter scripts that serve one purpose, to let your forget your troubles for 2 hours and enjoy things being blown up or shootouts occurring that you would never see in normal day to day live.Did people forget that the average day for a cop is pretty much boring? They are not chasing down international drug dealers everyday where they have one assassin who is the best trained and can take out an entire squad on their own?Did people forget that most police officers, even narcos do not have the swagger and personality of Mike Lowery but are more like a Marcus Barnett (Married Kids, trying to have a peaceful existence)If you walked into Bad Boys 4 Life expecting anymore than what was promised via the previous 2 films you set yourself up for failure.Bad Boys 4 Life, even under new directors, still entertains and has some great laughs because it never set out to be an Oscar Contender, it was made for the exact same audience as a Fast & Furious movie and the expectations to be that were met from start to finish.One thing BB4L did accomplish significantly is that it shows neither Will nor Martin have lost their comedic touch and make us remember why we enjoyed the 1st two films as much as we did.Also, BB4L is a natural progression of getting older, living off the Lethal Weapon Mantra that we're not too old for this stuff, and it is true, while Will and Martin are in their 50's and one is definitely ready for greener pastures they still delivered.So stop trying to act like every film needs to be Oscar Worthy, they don't. They need to accomplish one thing... Be Entertaining, and BB4L delivered!Marcus and Mike are back.","19 out of 32 found this helpful.

No one here will surprise you.Writing- Wack. Will and Martin needed more to work with. It was so dull. Bad Boys 2 may be easy to hate in some aspects, but that movie is hilarious at all the right moments.Quality- I hated the direction and cinematography. Everything was so shaky. A quarter of this film felt like an Indian dance music video.Overall, wouldn't recommend it unless it's free. As a major fan of Bad Boys 2, I am only here to tell others to not waste their time.

This is a sad depiction of the superficial movie creators (and watchers) that this movie tends to attract. No creative people, but wallets and smart investors.

Hands down, this one is my favorite. Its gives you all the comedic action your accustomed to in the opening minutes and doesnt stop there. You can see early on that while the same, Mike and Marcus have aged physically and mentally from the last installment. They dont try to hide it either. They play off one another and their age. Compared to the other two movies though, this one has a more personal feel to it from start to finish. It does have its typical ""young cop vs old cop"" banter with some of the actors/actresses but it just works and they blend with this ""world"" well together. I for one think it was very well filmed, edited, and scored. For the most part it doesnt have too many over the top action sequences that make you roll your eyes due to unbelievablity. Knowing what I was going in to see, it was nice to be surprised with liking it even more than I already expected to.

"3","/10","Minus two stars for AMMO and plot holes, minus five stars for the plot twist","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5420994/?ref_=tt_urv","thebricks","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur37569728/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2020","Much better than Bad Boys 2, if you turn your brain off all the way, it's an enjoyable movie. If you don't, you're going to regret paying for the film. This movie definitely had some studio interference going on on the level of what happened with the new Star Wars film.My first gripe, the special investigations unit, AMMO. Please, if a sequel is made, do not bring them back. The only reason they were included was because some suit in a studio demanded young, hip, hipster types to appeal to the teen and twenty-something demographic. They were just awful. The original movie was far more grounded than this one. While they got the tone right, AMMO just stuck out like a sore thumb. It felt like something out of a dumb TV show on a network. There's a saying, ""Jack of all trades, master of none""? I know the studio feels they are clever trying to hit all the demographics, but sometimes, you just have to commit to one so you don't make a joke of your project. You can have young cops and detectives without making them utterly annoying. I won't even get into that bizarre, cringe-worthy club scene. Holy cow.My second gripe, the plot holes and inaccuracies. It's 2019, if you've seen Mythbusters, watched National Geographic shows and First 48, are familiar with Miami, a lot about this movie is going to rub you the wrong way. If you've ever seen a First 48 set in Miami, prepare to be massively disappointed. It's just about the most boring place you'll ever see. For some reason, while LAPD always gets faithfully depicted on screen for the most part, Hollywood thinks Miami PD is like some big vacation where everyone is hip and shows up to work like they're hanging out on the beach. Also, Mike does things that are all but guaranteed to get him fired and force the department to pay out millions. Especially that first car chase scene, what was up with that?Last gripe, oh man, this is a big one, that plot twist. Man, that was so bad. Whoever wrote the script and directed had no idea when the movie was made. I believe Mike Lowery was working at least a few years before the first movie, so there's no way what happened could have happened. The timelines do not match up by a country mile. He and Marcus were good friends and established, so they had to have been working for a while. Where did all this hot mess come from? After the last scene of the movie, I should have given this zero out of ten stars but I enjoyed myself, so I'm being generous.This was almost a great movie. It's a shame some suit ruined it trying to make it a franchise. Sorry guys, it's not. It's never going to be Avengers. They did this to the last Bourne too and completely sold it out. I almost hate to say it, but it's starting to seem like I'd rather stay home and stream than go to the movies anymore. The streaming sites are doing some amazing stuff for only $6-12 a month. Why go to movies anymore for this? Seriously.","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

When the reviews went out i really was interested in see the new intallment, so a went to see it and man, really surprised me, this movie is better in every single thing that the two first movies aren't... the cinematography is better, the directorial work is better, is more funny, more suspensiful and with better action, and the best thing about the first films are even better! Smith and Lawrence are great in this movie!! But the two best things about this third movie is the script and the directors, first this script is better than the two first movie combined!! Is personal and really take this characters in a actual arc trought the movie. Change Michael Bay was the best thing that this franchise ever did, i mean c'mon he has his unique style, that the directors of this movie tryes to replicate, but he doesnt know how to tell a story! This movie put the story first! Yes, the explosions are there, the action are there, the cars chasings, but you understand everything! Its not a mess like in bay's movies. This was one of the most fun and exicted buddy cop movies i've ever seen and for sure the best Bad boys!Ps: Martin Lawrence is hillarious!!!","14 out of 23 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A Part-Meditative Part-90's Nostalgic Action Comedy, Best Bad Boys Film To Date.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6072524/?ref_=tt_urv","ObsessiveCinemaDisorder","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur77520024/?ref_=tt_urv","7 September 2020","Bad Boys For Life ReviewOld school cops Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett, assisted by a new elite police team AMMO, team up to take down the ruthless leader of a Miami drug cartel, Armando Armas.The buddy cop movie was my favorite genre growing up and fortunately for me, there was an overabundance of them through the nineties. Whether they were good or bad, I loved them all regardless because I enjoyed the core dynamic of what they're about: male friendships.Directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, who have taken over the directing reins from Michael Bay, understand this completely and competently deliver a great third Bad Boys movie, a movie sequel nobody was asking for. They deliver all the things one would expect and deliver some nice surprises along the way.Will Smith and Martin Lawrence's onscreen chemistry is still vibrant and is the price of admission. They are like real inseparable best friends who are ribbing each other all the time. It seemed like they're ad-libbing a lot of the zingers between takes. The lines seem so natural at times that a screenwriter would have to pull their hair out in the middle of the night on caffeine to chisel dialogue to that level.The jokes are hilarious and they are many laughs. Essentially, Will Smith does the action and Martin Lawrence supplies the reaction. It's a simple gag that doesn't seem to get old. Initially, it seemed like Martin Lawrence's deliveries were a bit slow, like he was getting over some illness, but it was more on point as the movie progressed. There's even a great follow-up to the Reggie scene from Bad Boys 2, one of its funniest scenes.The action sequences are over-the-top but tame in comparison to the sequences directed by Michael Bay (who has a little cameo as a wedding party guest). What can get more high-octane than that highway scene from Bad Boys 2 anyways? For an action comedy, the comedy portion is the bigger sell than the action portion. Whenever there are action scenes without the two leads, the film begins to feel like a by-the-numbers action movie really quickly.The script, by Joe Carnahan, Peter Craig, and Chris Bremner, dives deeper into Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett, who are the archetypal 90's buddy cop duo. The script explores further into the spiritual aspect of Martin Lawrence's Marcus character, which was previously done as a character gag in Bad Boys 2 (""Woosah!"") and have stitched it into a meaningful story about a gun-toting action hero wanting to renounce violence and bloodshed. Yes, this movie gets deep at times in unexpected ways.Will Smith's Mike Lowrey character can only exist onscreen in a movie. He's a movie cop whose rich parents have died and left him with great wealth, but he chooses to be a cop anyways and uses that money to buy flashy clothes and sports cars to chase bad guys with. He always shoots first and asks questions later, knowingly endangers the lives of citizens in car chases, and openly claims that he loves shooting bad guys to death. If this person existed in real life, he'd be diagnosed as a psychopath.This film pries that open and deconstructs that in a fascinating way. There's a scene where Mike Lowrey actually is disappointed that he is required to use rubber rounds on criminals and Marcus repetitively tells Mike there is something mentally wrong with his love of police violence through the whole movie.The script forces the audience to consider all those faceless henchmen and villain kill counts in the previous Bad Boys as something that really happened and watch as the characters contemplate their own atonement. Dramatically speaking, Martin Lawrence steals the movie as he gets to show new depths with his character.If the movie gods ever allow it, I'd like to see what this writing team would do with Lethal Weapon 5, as Riggs and Murtaugh have similarly been reduced to being action hero archetypes after Lethal Weapon 2 and could use this type of deconstruction. Directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah are working on the fourth Beverly Hills Cop, so I'll settle for that.Bad Boys For Life will probably be most satisfying for fans of the series who were there since the beginning. For first-timers watching this as their very first Bad Boys film, it will probably be a great one-time watch, but it won't have them looking up the back catalog. There may be no point doing that anyways as this is probably the best of the three.","14 out of 23 found this helpful.

I'm a life long Will Smith fan & have been since the very early 90's & Will Smith is my all time favourite actor & i was so excited when it was announced by Smith & Lawrence that they're back for a 3rd film. I really feel like i grew up with these characters as i watched the first Bad Boys over & over on video bk in the 90's, so i have big Nostalgia love for Will Smith as Mike & Martin Lawrence as Marcus. There's definitely a loving heartbeat to this entry as we see our favourite buddy cops operate in our modern times that's full of futuristic technology & new ways of policing using gadgets & new young blood on the police force that are all tech savvy & our old school cops still wanna do what they do best in their old school ways. A change of times & our cops are aging & have lost a step or two but their hearts are always in the right place. I loved the story here, the script, the look of the movie, the music & the emotional weight of the piece. Martin Lawrence gives the best performance of his Career & Will is excellent & gives the feel that his kick-ass legendary Bad Boy Lowry is trying so hard to still be who he was but in a totally different modernised world. You get the feel to that Will is trying to hang on to his action star image as an ageing actor & i love him even more for being so vulnerable here. Truly a terrific actor & an incredible performance. No actor has ever meant more to me than Will Smith. This could actually be my favourite Will Smith performance!!!This excellent movie was like an invitation to see old friends again & i loved every minute of it!!! Bad Boys for Life is an instant CLASSIC, a modern action buddy-cop Masterpiece.I believe Bad Boys for life to be an instant CLASSIC.I grew up watching Smith & Lawrence on video with the likes of Independence Day, Men in black 1&2, Bad Boys 1&2, Wild Wild West, Enemy of the State, i, Robot, Blue Streak, Big Mommas House & more so it's great to see them both older as I've grown with them & it's nice to see Martin back in movies!!!!Bad Boys for life is much more grounded in ways compared to the other two films & is more on the grittier & darker side of action but still with plenty of humorous bits & funny banter between our favourite Miami cops but there's a hell of alot more Heart & emotion throughout this action thriller.Will Smith's Mike Lowry is much more a troubled & lost guy in this film & Will shows his outstanding talent as the incredible serious actor he has become, here Smith gives one of his best performances as this older & more emotional version of Mike Lowry who is usually known as the super sexy & super cool super cop but here he's every bit the damaged cop & lost soul of an older guy without meaning or a family of his own, he just has the job. Also Martin Lawrence gives the best performance of his mostly comedic career as an older, wiser & less violent or crazy, settled down family man & granddad version of Marcus Burnett, he acts serious often as well as be funny but it's another heartfelt performance.This is old school cop's in a new age of technology, gadgets & weapons & it's full of thrillingly action set-pieces. As said, our hero cops are older & can't do what they used to do & are realising they can't beat the clock. There's a Nostalgic sadness to the performances here especially Will Smith's because it's like having to except his glory days are over & he hasn't got anything to show for it whereas Marcus has a family that growing with his new grandkids. Smith shows alot of emotions on his face & there's a sadness to his performance that carries a heaviness of feelings throughout the film, a deeper Mike & a more personal Will Smith in his age both combined for a real deep & dramatic performance.The danger is more brutal & frantic than ever here & it's all shot beautifully by new director's so there's a real fresh & exciting approach to it all & the cinematography & look is stunning & extremely colourful & pure eye-catching visuals on screen, the best looking film in the Trilogy. We also get their excellent Captain back again played by the excellent Joe Pantaoliano & a new younger high-tech team of Cops called ""Ammo"" that are there to help out our cops. The villains this time are an extremely deadly cartel from Mexico that really wants to kill Mike Lowry for reasons that uncover later, this movie is action packed, shocking at times & full of mystery & excitement all wrapped up in a fun Action packed Cop thriller, a great movie & one of the best action films of the genre in years.Nostalga & heart make this bad boys film great meaningful entertainment & one that can be watched countless times. Love Will Smith y'all & big love for having Martin Lawrence back.Great entertainment from beginning to end.","36 out of 69 found this helpful.

It wasn't filmed the same way as the first two, 4K is awesome but somehow it just makes this movie super boring along with all of its wide-panning zoom drone usage. It had its couple of moments, but sincerely nothing more. Bad Boys is probably in my top 3 along with T2: Judgment Day, where very rarely does a sequel get to be as good or better than the original, but what the heck happened here?! Felt like I was watching a over-the-top soap opera that had millions invested into it. What a sad waste & way to ruin a perfect franchise. Then again, i might've just had my expectations way too high.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Did Will Smith do it as a favour to a less famous mate who needs a career lift? The jokes fall way wide of the mark as they are so predictable and the twist is ludicrous. Clearly there will be more to come but include me out.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

It had a lot of swearing, blood, explosions and freaking tons of humor that was all my adolescent mind needed at the time. As I grew older and (hopefully) wiser I've excluded any possibility of a triquel to ever arrive in theaters but this day has finally come and I went to see it and boy I felt like a child once again. Although the movie has changed and it doesn't have the fast pace and as many explosions as it once used to (under the careful supervision of maestro Michael Bay) it covers it all up with freaking gazillion tons of humor, drama and great action. Will Smith is back in the saddle again after the failure of Gemini Man and roars fire into Bad Boys For Life. It's also nice to see good old Martin Lawrence at his side who seems to have vanished from the big screen since late 2000s - their duo is unstoppable and I felt like no time has passed since the sequel; it tied up the stories told in the first two movies almost perfectly and had time to tell new ones, did some nice character development and played a little with nostalgia, in a word, a triquel worth waiting for.","12 out of 20 found this helpful.

The film turned Mike to a, frankly, quite unlikeable character, who's motives very not justified at all. The comedy did not hit it off, there was little to no emotional fulfillment, and the action sequences were so over the top to the point where there is no chance that either Mike or Marcus should have survived. The cast was unimpressive, and the big twist at the end was seemingly just done to have a twist, totally unnecessary.
The characters are supposed to be 20 years older than in the previous movies, and where as one of the charaters is acting older than his age, his trigger-happy counterpart seems like he is still 21 and not 51 years of age.
Do not go in to this movie expecting any sort of consistent or memorable plot, you will have forgotten this movie within a couple of days","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Everything that's expected of a Bad Boys film is definitely accounted for but it also successfully modernises the franchise. Finally letting them grow as characters, acknowledging their age and stopping running away from their vulnerabilities, embracing both them and the newfound telenovela vibes.Will Smith & Martin Lawrence have still got it. Their chemistry is intact when it comes to the comedic rapport as well as the genuine care they have for each other. It's very satisfying to see Martin Lawrence get some serious emotional beats to play with early on and it's equally rewarding to see Will Smith open up in between all his usual quips and effortlessly cool presence.They're supported by a group of younger newcomers who would usually be a red flag in case it backfires like it did for Expendables 3. However, Charles Melton, Alexander Ludwig and Vanessa Hudgens are all so likeable that they become welcome additions with Paola Nuñez elegantly leading the group and Joe Pantoliano being super stressed out with reliably hilarious results.Adil El Arbi & Bilall Fallah accomplish the tricky task of paying homage to the master of destruction who preceded them whilst still bringing their own style. There's some inventive shots, lots of carnage and the action finds a different rhythm by cutting less. Lorne Balfe's score thankfully doesn't forget to include the classic theme in between all the new very dramatic flourishes.","80 out of 176 found this helpful.

However, I can't dwell on such a little thing when Bad Boys for life gives us everything that all the others give us. Action adventure, hilarious ness with Lawrence jut bringing that humor. Plus, nothing beats the part when they pull it all together to ride or die.

The chemistry is still there between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, i have not laughed so hard in a while, it kept me laughing throughout the movie.The Amo cast was also good, they brought more relief in the group if there was any tension, just a wonderful movie to go relax and have a good time.Storyline was very interesting, a lot of good writing was involved.

The hacking was a bit unrealistically quick but still doable. Also, some elements would be stupid in real world but are still in the movie to intimidate the viewer and visually tell about the characters, but in a movie it's ok IMO.Regarding the negative reviews; I think there's something different in this movie that comes from Will as he ages and spiritually matures, he seeks an alternative to violence and tries to incorporate that into violent action movies (spies in disguise is a prime example). This is what irritates some people, because it should be a violent action movie after all - but it still is, and I think it is indeed brave and much needed to bring something new into the genre, and I like it. But if you wan't ""none of that peace talk"" or get excruciatingly annoyed when people try to stay non-violent this movie maybe isn't for you.","31 out of 63 found this helpful.

Meanwhile, Isabel Aretas (Kate del Castillo) escapes from a Mexican prison with witchcraft and her son. The two set out to take revenge with the finale being Mike.The boys are back and they are better in one respect. Essentially, they have become Riggs and Murtaugh. Marcus is now doing too-old-for-this... Mike is edging into mental melodrama with the reveal. The reveal is an interesting one. I would have liked a de-aging sequence with Driving Miss Daisy. There is still plenty of ridiculous action after getting away from Michael Bay. The best of the franchise continues to be the duo's chemistry. The airplane sequence is hilarious. The main flaw is that the couple gets separate for a large chunk of the movie. They need to be together every second so that they can maximize that magic. This is obviously aiming for more sequels and the one that I would keep is the muscle man pacifist.","14 out of 25 found this helpful.

"8","/10","How to make Good Bad Boys - Subtract Michael Bay","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5419688/?ref_=tt_urv","CuriosityKilledShawn","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0102816/?ref_=tt_urv","19 January 2020","I don't think that the original Bad Boys is a great movie (or a particularly good one) but it WAS lightening in a bottle and the correct mix of talents at the right time. It kickstarted the career Michael Bay and turned Will Smith from a TV star into a movie star. It took an unusual amount of time for the sequel to arrive and by the time summer 2003 came around we were treated/subjected to Michael Bay at his absolute worst with full creative autonomy. Bad Boys II is one of the most utterly repugnant films I have ever seen and I once thought that it killed the series forever. In the nearly seventeen years since its release there has been lots of talk about a Bad Boys III but with the once high-flying, then stalling career of Will Smith and the non-star power of Martin Lawrence there was never a right moment.Thankfully, the long wait meant that Michael Bay was off the project. Instead Belgian filmmakers Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah are calling the shots and new writers are involved, and it's far, far superior to either of the previous movies with some truly shocking moments that will have you holding your breath. What a happy surprise.Marcus Burnett and Mike Lowry are now in their 50s and feeling the toll that their lifestyle has taken on their bodies, though Mike is in denial about it. They know that they are nearing the end of their careers and partnership but are finding transitioning into the next phase of their lives difficult. Meanwhile, a maniacal villainess down in Mexico is planning a series of revenge executions with Mike Lowry as the final target into backstory before the events of first movie and ties them all together.The bad guys in the first two movies were just cardboard cut-outs with little-to-zero motivation while Marcus and Mike themselves had rather poor character development, relying too much on the ad-libbed chemistry between the stars and the perceived idea of childish ""cool"" that they were supposed to exhibit. Bad Boys for Life delivers so much, much more than that. Not only is the directing more mature and restrained but the writing is far superior, giving everyone depth, meaningful dialogue, and some really involving conflict and character development.This movie is ""Bad Grown-Ups"". Michael Bay makes movies for angry teenage boys, but Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah have superseded him and delivered the absolute best in the series so far. You could call it a million times better than Bad Boys II but a million times nothing is still nothing, though it's better than that. I went in with expectations lower than minus infinity and was quite surprised and taken aback. Lorne Balfe even brings back Mark Mancina's original themes, which Trevor Rabin unwisely ditched for the second movie.I'd like to see Bad Boys for Life be the success that it deserves. Will Smith's career has been a trainwreck for a long time now, and with the recent bomb of Gemini Man still haunting him it would restore his credibility if Bad Boys for Life did bigger business than Bad Boys II. The theatre I went to was packed for an afternoon showing, so it's looking promising. They've made a silk purse out of a pig's ear and in the process they have, by accident, bigged-up the first two movies. Michael Bay does make a cameo as a wedding announcer, but that's the limit of his involvement, and everyone is better off for it.","24 out of 50 found this helpful.

I liked the story. Lawrence and Smith had no trouble finding their natural chemistry again, like they had in Bad Boys 1 and 2 as well. You could notice that Michael Bay was off and El Arbi and Fallah on.
I missed a moment were Burnett and Lowrey encouraged each other verbally around bad guys and then reach for their guns (BB1: ""It's for your lack of respect for other people's property). I also missed some experimental camera work (BB 2: ""A bullet in the head will really mess up your extensions"").
I enjoyed what the AMMO team brought to the table. This could have been worked out a lot better, I think. Hopefully they do that in Bad Boys 4. Hudgens, Ludwig and Melton did a great job, bringing their own humour and style.
There were some references to the other movies, but there could have been more. I really hope there will be a next installment with the same directors, and that El Arbi and Fallah will have a very rich career ahead of them.
If you liked this movie, then check out Gangsta, El Arbi's and Fallah's film before this one.","12 out of 22 found this helpful.

This is a stupid movie. Full stop. No redeeming, ""but if you like..."" or ""if you turn your brain off..."" No. This is just stupid.It's been 17 years. Seventeen. Since the last ride with the boys and time has not been kind. Martin Lawrence was funny once. He's not now and, frankly he doesn't seem physically up to the task anymore. Will Smith, he's exploded since then and now, looking at him in this role again is just wrong. He's trying to have fun with it and take it seriously at the same time and it misses entirely.As for the rest of the cast, it's filled with a lot of beautiful people, and that's all there really is to say here. They make for a great visual but it all feels forced and awkward.Fortunately, Michael Bay is the master of ridiculous action stuff. The man has been doing it for years... So why are there so many spots were the effects look worse than anything in Bad Boys 1? There were maybe 3-5 instances of just awful effects work in this, explosions and fire that look like somebody whipped it up 20 years ago. Bay! Come on! This is the one thing that you're supposed to be good at! What are you doing? That's not to mention the parts that look like old, bad 3D gimmicks, which is sad because I don't think there's a 3D version of this movie.So it looks bad. The people are pretty but not given anything to work with. The story! The story will save us. Bay is obviously known for his stor- Oh. Whoops. This is as ridiculous as you'd expect from a man that thought ball jokes on Transformers was gold. Whats really crazy is how eerily similar a part of this was to Gemini Man... but oh well.Seriously, there is nothing here. It's pure nonsense, which to be fair, Michael Bay has flirted with that a lot, but this is taking Bad Boys and turning it into a cartoon. I'm talking Transformers: Age of Extinction levels of Bay.Steer clear.","30 out of 72 found this helpful.

I'll be honest, I don't remember seeing the first two Bad Boys in their entirety, but I loved this movie. I went to watch it a few days ago and I really enjoyed it. It never felt bland and you were always glued to the screen. The comedy and action sequences were always appealing. You were always in for a treat when watching the movie. I liked how they played up the characters ages and made it part of the story. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have some serious chemistry and it showed through the screen. It was an entertaining movie and one that I would recommend. I'm excited about the fourth part and hope that it's better or as good as the third one.","28 out of 64 found this helpful.

Wanted to stop it right in the middle, it was so boring. Annoyingly boring. Nothing to do with the good old BB....Very poor acting by all the young actors. Very poor. Especially the females - total failure, including the ""witch"". If this is the next generation of actors then Hollywood is doomed.The ""Bad Boys"" looked so silly at moments with that old crap ""for life"" and the fist bumping. Unfunny or clichéd jokes, absolutely nothing new as a story line. Who wrote that crap and why?!?Martin and Will looked very bad, seems like aging got them hard.
They were great in the old BB films but it seems they've lost the magic of Mike & Marcus.Sorry to say it but this film was not needed. 30 minutes after it's end I already don't remember most of it. One of those films you won't remember the day after.Another killed franchise in the bag, WTG Hollywood...Disappointing.

"9","/10","An Unexpected Surprise","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5471852/?ref_=tt_urv","aidanratesmovies","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur48282208/?ref_=tt_urv","9 February 2020","With some much needed change in direction, an improvement in action and humor, and as always the beloved chemistry of Lawrence and Smith, Bad Boys For Life truly harnesses the potential of the franchise by doing something different and graciously succeeding. The film is largely entertaining, with action pieces that are no longer so much in your face, but feel more personal and thrilling than before. Martin Lawrence and Will Smith truly continue to harness the films energy to a point, providing some great comedic and far more serious performances than before, making their characters not only more round, but likeable. Directors Bilall Fallah and Adil El Arbi truly take the film to the next level, with some clever set pieces, use of story, and by far some amazing visuals. The film is oddly beautiful, which is not only refreshing from the sun drenched look of Bay's style before it, but also fits well. The style does seem a bit odd, considering the previous ones are oh so different, but it works in a way that doesn't seem too forced or too out of place. The use of the new team, Ammo, in the film is a well appreciated addition, and makes for some quite humorous moments. The villain also seems far more rounded than in previous films, and provides for a quiet interesting arc. The biggest problem I had with the film, is the progression of the story, and pacing throughout. The film bounces around a lot forward with things moving rather fast over large periods of time, making it seem kinda choppy. It never felt too long, but it felt like a lot to process given the circumstances, and felt like it could have been better handled, and/or more condensed, which does dwindle from making it a bit better than it could have. In the end, however, Bad Boys For Life is a perfectly enjoyable and surprisingly refreshing sequel, that finally harnesses the talents of the stars involved and makes for a worthwhile plot that is not forced and cliche, but actually interesting.
My Rating: 9/10","34 out of 80 found this helpful.

It was incredible to see the chemistry pick up right where it left off 17 years ago. They fell right back in to the roles of Marcus and Mike. The story was what you would expect, Wild, action packed, funny, with a bit of campiness. Not every movie is made for the academy, so don't expect this to be one either. It was a hell of a lot of fun, I laughed, got surprised, and even a touch emotional at times, and that's all I ask from a movie.

I don't know the character flow in the first half felt forced and not good, no comedy, no action, pure drama, and many unnecessary scenes.
-
Then there is halfway into the movie or more like 75% in, it's like they got the old script writer back in or a new script to work with (the airplane scene), they went back to being into their old characters from the previous movie, funny dialog, action, quick wit...etc, and from here on until the end it got pretty good, so I have a feeling this was the real script , and the first half of the movie was make it up as you go to fill in the extra timeline...really if you watch the first 12 minutes (to find out who the villains are, then fast forward to about 50-75% in) it will be a good movie.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

They did not!Over all, ""Bad boys for life"" is a nice actionflick; mediocre but in fair OK.
The film has its flaws though, the script for one. Editing and direction being the other two. By their own they're not killing the movie but together they sort of do.The script has a story that, I'm sorry to say, does not work all the way. It's just way too long without any tension torgue. The editor and the directors (There's two) seems to work together, usually a good thing but here they copy the style of Michael Bays original style of direction. It's just copying, without any sort of personal touch to it. Lots of slowmo etc without any reason for example. Ok, but they're in the wrong places.As I see it there's two ways of making this film awesome.
1: Working on the script to make it much, much more tight.
2: Cut the film down to 90 min, maximum 100 min.An ok film. Not more. I thought it would be better.Grade 5/10","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Well that's no much longer guys.It felt like a late 80's or early 90's movie. That would be okay if it was done with style but it didn't have that either. It was formulaic and generic. It makes sense due to the fact the movie lost every talented director and resorted to par talent and studio knowledge.
The plot was weak. It felt needless. The only thing I can say in the positive is that the pacing was constant. However the fact that the plot was weak, the core was generic, whatever the pace did for the movie, it was lost due to multiple eye rolls. Many pillars were used to hold this movie up that were very unnecessary to the plot. There is no weight or urgency. And when a plot is established, a power ranger like entity is introduced to establish needless variety and unrealistic content. Sexy swat. Asian Justin timberlake, Viking, no axe and venessa judgement packing heat.
The old movies were corny action, but it was stylish and grounded in the creative teams vision for the movie. It was hip and current. Ya it still had generic plots but it was carried by style, humour, action and none of it felt forced and the chemistry was relevant. This time the directors felt foreign to the material besides being a action movie and will smith being the lead. They leaned heavily on will smith and his Brody, gangsta attitude didn't quite fit with his age and felt forced compared to the originals. The movie was always about the boys. I did like the times Lawrence shined. But those are very few and far between. Instead the director made a plot that centered heavy on will.
I am not a fan of Bay. But that's not to say he knows his stuff. When it comes to in your face style and entertainment, Color and sound that melts your senses, a few cut and pasted scenes (hahaha), he's good at what he does. So I hope he does do a bad boys 4 and they aim more towards a lethal weapon 4 vibe.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

I mean Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are fun to watch together, and have this budding chemistry that makes the films work, and action scenes are awesome, but the villains and the plot in the last two films pretty much went nowhere.But that all changes with Bad Boys for Life, here the plot is pretty well told has the two main characters realize that there age is catching, and that there not has young has they once where. And this time the villains have a bigger part, and has a somewhat connection to one of the main characters. But not just depends on Lawrence and Smith, the supporting cast also really shine.

But this man what was this...You know the biggest complaint most people had about the second one was what a whiner they turned Martin Lawrence into, so what did they do in this one they made him an even worse whiner (I really did not think that was possible). Lawrence was so whiny he was just annoying and any chemistry he and Smith had in the first 2 is completely gone.The directors also never heard of these guys but did anyone else notice they were just rippin off Michael Bay. Trying to do his style and failing at it terribly. Not to mention the story line just plain stunk, I am not sure who wrote this but wow it was sure a poor script.Save yourselves if you enjoyed the first 2 don't sully them by watching this one.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Yes, it probably has a lot to do with him not directing and only cameoing in this. And I would've rated this even higher if it weren't so damn long. Seriously. This and the aforementioned & referenced Lethal Weapon 4 have that plus some more in common: WAY TOO LONG, WAY TOO MANY HOMAGES, WAY TOO MUCH BAD CGI IN CLIMAX and WAY TOO MUCH USE OF THE TITLE SONG.Okay, got that out of the way. I really liked this movie!Hilarious, great action, beautifully shot with so many wonderful color schemes, great chemistry with several tear-jerking scenes and to top it all off: two SOOO incredibly gorgeous actors, I instantly fell in love with the villain: Jacob Scipio and Will Smith's other comic relief: Charles Melton. Two names that will mean something to me in the future, I bet.Um. I digress. This is the stereotypical 90s Action Buddy Cop movie that could never happen in real life, but always enjoyable on screen. With one of my least favorite buddy cop tropes, the ""I'm getting too old for this sh#t""/5-days to retirement, Marcus almost loses his best friend/partner Mike during a drive-by shooting and the two are out to find the killer and resolve that case.I actually never really wanted to see this. I saw part one ONLY because of its popularity. In fact, I have it recorded I saw it on February 26, 2012, almost 16½ years after its release and I thought it was just okay. Nothing against Will Smith or Martin Lawrence. I like them, for sure. I just hate Michael Bay. I ONLY watched his Transformers movies (all but #5 when I seriously could NOT TAKE THEM ANY LONGER) for the fact they were SOOO BAD, they were unintentionally hilarious. Much like the Twilight movies, The Room or Birdemic: Shock and Terror.And when it comes to part II, never saw it. I had my fill with the first Bay music video/movie. So, technically, I can't say this is the best Bad Boys, but it's certainly my favorite one.Now, granted, like I said above, there was a lot of overkill in this movie - for the love of GOD, I never want to hear that theme song again. But I thoroughly enjoyed the action, sights, chemistry, humor and devotion of the two leads.Not to mention, my two future husbands: Jacob and Charles.***Final thoughts: Wow. Talk about timing. They must've known the pandemic was coming. They actually released this part 3 in the movie dumping grounds of January. This is SUCH a summer release! How did they NOT have faith in it?","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The only reason i am giving it a 3 is because of the title and Will Smith. The acting is mediocre, the writing is weak and the directing amateurish.
The writing is so bad and predictable with cheap jokes flying everywhere. It made me suffer listening to the dialogue.
At the beginning of the movie I was nostalgic and wondering why Martine Lawrence disappeared as an actor but by the end of the movie I was questioning how he became an actor in the first place. It was cringeworthy watching him. The new actors are so made up/fake, they look like they came from a bad soap drama.
Really dissapointed in this movie that I had high hopes for. Kept checking the clock waiting for it to be over and didn't even care how it ended just as long as the suffering stopped.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was a modern twist on the age-old Cops vs Drugs story. Cool, fun, and funny; it' a playbook that works. Bad Boys II is a repeat of the same thing. Drug war while being cool, fun, and funny. Also a great watch.
I have really been dying for this movie to be made and to be released, and it SHOULD HAVE BEEN the same playbook, instead it went in a completely different direction.
This new movie made NO sense at all. Action was okay, but the plot was sooo stupid. It is just so hard for me to even believe the plot; even if I try to believe it, it is just so stupid and childish.
I was only happy to see that they brought back so much of the original cast but I realized they only did this for show. Overall stupid and they have set this movie up for future, additional stupidity for a potential Bad Boys IV.Btw, it's fake reviews that gave this movie such a strong rating.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Other than the nostalgia there isn't alot left, poor and predictable story, action scenes are badly over exadurated and the acting isn't great (I'm looking at you DJ Khalid) Will Smith carries the film almost entirely and Martin Lawrence tries his best but it feels like he's forcing the jokes and they don't land, only one or two that made me chuckle. The AMMO team are just extras and make scenes cheesy which isn't great. Overall if you like the first two films you'll tolerate this one but I think everybody would agree its time for the franchise to come to an end.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I always liked the humor and action these movies provided. The villians is what usually attracts me, like the Russian in part one or Johnny Tapia in part 2. The villians in this one clearly knock the other 2 out of the water. I love how they never give anything about the villians away in the previews, so when your at the theatres it gives you that element of surprise. I thought without Michael Bay they were going to ruin this franchise but I was definitely wrong. The director here captured everything on film the action, the humor, the sadness, the whole level of love that the partners share of one another. I felt like I was in Miami sitting in the back seat of every scene in Bad Boys 3. With all that being said this probaly is my favorite movie to ever see in theatres or possibly ever seen. Go watch this in theatres, you will not be disappointed.","21 out of 50 found this helpful.

It's more an attempt to re-start a dormant franchise (Bad Boys 4) and to give Sony and Will Smith another bankable series or to say like this - it's more a cash grab for Hollywood nostalgia than a commentary on nostalgia itself. In a way, it feels like a version of ""Gemini Man"". Scenes of high speed chases are just not entertaining at all (actually they are quite boring). Comedy part of the movie are, also, not enough to lift the film out of the doldrums of mediocrity. it's just another generic, modern day action film - easily digestible and largely forgettable.Rating: 5- (Average and forgettable)","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

If you wish to watch an action movie and pass a good time, without thinking (too much) about the past memories of the previous two movies and our Bad Boys' wonderful experiences and adventures together, then, that's the movie for you; on the other hand, if you want to see a Bad Boys movie and enjoy once again the charm, joy and chemistry so dearly felt in the previous two movies, then as a fan, I'd like to hint to have your expectations a little bit lower and set the quality bar two to three notches down.Whatever your decision and impression, pass a nice time watching a nostalgic little treasure.","7 out of 13 found this helpful.

Wasn't looking for anything other than a big dumb silly action flick and it didn't even deliver that. It's been years since I've been so baffled by a movie this bad getting generally positive reviews.Martin Lawrence was painful to watch. The dialogue was wooden and 90% of the jokes didn't land. Even in a packed theater on Saturday night there were maybe 10 times that got chuckles and only 2 or 3 solid laughs.Apart from a few highlights scattered throughout even the action scenes were dull.It's been ages since I considered walking out of a movie, and I would have if anything else was still playing in the cineplex I saw it, but unfortunately it was a late show so I stuck it out.As a counterpoint, one of the two girls I took to the movie enjoyed it, the other hated it even more than I did. That's the only reason I gave it four stars, rounding up from the 33% of our party. Left to my own subjective opinion, it would have been 1.5-2.5 stars at best.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

When a movie begins at break neck speed with an OTT car chase with gravity & physics defying stunts to a hospital because someone's having a baby, you know the producers /directors aren't taking their own movie seriously & that's exactly how this movie should be viewed, as a children's cartoon, a very expensive children's cartoon.
The story / plot is something you expect a teenager to write after binge watching bad boys 1 & 2 & quite literally every scene is from ""how to direct the Michael Bay way"", the stunts are excellent but they are just ""stunts"" nothing looks real every scene looks as tho its a ""set"", every car chase, bike chase looks impossible & unrealistic.
Why oh why do writers think it's clever & imaginative to ""create"" characters that are unbelievable, if this were a fantasy set in middle earth or a sci-fi epic set in the far flung future the characters that make up A. M. M. O. would be no less laughable, the notion that a police force anywhere on this planet would create a multi-million dollar task force with access to every database in existence & then allow a bunch of screw ups with mental health, authority & gender issues to do with it as they wish is laughably childish, perhaps the writers watched far too much Power Rangers in their formative years.
The story itself which by anyone's standards is garbage is literally killed off half way through the movie with a jump then of 6 months in which nothing has happened, nothing, a whole 6 months where no investigation or incident has taken place to then only resume with the re-emergence of the main character, to say this movie is dumb is an insult to dumb, even dumb isn't this stupid.
If this were just one of the many garbage TV shows that netflix, amazon or Disney were vomiting out I would at least understand but this is a theatrical release to cinemas, movies like this are not going to attract movie goers to shell out their hard earned cash.
The list is endless when it comes to disappointing cinema releases, whether it's one off story's or part of a franchise but there are few gems out there, unfortunately you'll need to dig through the garbage to find one.
We may live in an age of PC gone insane but it seems it will always be ok to have a dig at the ""white man"".
Given how small & meaningless the story/plot of this movie is its runtime is about 40 minutes too long, alas it would seem a 4th instalment is hinted at the end of this, hopefully it's cumulative worldwide box office takings will extinguish that threat, if not then hopefully they'll hire better writer & give the audience something worth watching.
Neither a comedy or action movie, yet it is laughable how the ""evil"" villain that murders indiscrimently is lauded at the end as much as the so called ""hero"", then you realise the majority of ""murders"" are of white people, about time you came out with it Mr Smith after all it's glaringly obvious.
I've given this 3 stars for the brilliant Joe Pantoliano, had he been in the entire movie I would have given 5 stars, the movie itself gets 0 stars, everything in this movie has been done to death before, within the previous 2 Bad Boys movies & the Fast & Furious & Transformers franchises.
Not so much bad boys, bad boys, more bad movie bad movie.","15 out of 36 found this helpful.

We have our very own flavor. Watched this movie now in nyc and thought it's a Hindi action movie with a weak script and paceless direction and editing. There are too many scenes taken from old Hindi movies but badly done. Clearly the directors, Adil and Bilal have been influenced by Bollywood but they need to know that just copying scenes is not enough , they have to work in the screenplay and make it their own. If you want to watch slow motion action then Bollywood is the best in the world at it. Bollywood has the best editors in the world for time mapping editing. Please go watch some hindi action movies .

Everything felt forced. The first two installments were amazing for what they were. Yeah, they were over the top for the most part... I mean, it's a Bay film. But that simply means the action sequences were likely explosively exaggerated. But at least the acting was there. I'm sure some will refer to the first two has cheesy but the charisma between Smith and Laurence was so natural. You can feel the 17+ year gap in this most recent film. It's choppy. It's too scripted. It's not the same over-the-top scenarios we wanted. The ""Miami"" illuminated colors are there but that's honestly about it.

Time has passed also for the characters. This time everything is about age. They can still kick ass but there are other things important than an adrenaline driven life.
The directors; well let me tell you the change of pace certainly benefit the movie.
This time action is secondary to comedy and even some dramatic moments never present in the previous movies.
This time Will Smith left his ego behind and allow Martin Lawrence and Joe Pantoliano to shine; this one has very emotive moment and some brilliant comedy ones.
But Lawrence is basically the movie. Without him the movie could not even exist. He is the big motor behind and you miss him when is not in the screen.
The younger police members are basically the YOUNG PEOPLE REPLACEMENTS. Are there but did not change anything or even have some character development.
The bad guys are quite OK this time. But sadly the ending was too lazy to squeeze more juice out of the characters.

"3","/10","Retire Already","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5969549/?ref_=tt_urv","Cineanalyst","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1888886/?ref_=tt_urv","6 August 2020","""Bad Boys for Life""--thus far followed, mind you, by a movie based on a video-game hedgehog and another ""Dolittle"" disaster--might end up being the highest-grossing theatrically-released picture at the box office this year. Maybe it is the end of the world, after all. The timing of this release really was fortunate, too, when one also considers the national and, indeed, worldwide protests and unrest that has erupted against police violence since then. Beyond an interesting footnote, however, ""Bad Boys for Life"" is a bad addition to an already tired series. Moreover, the first two installments directed by Michael Bay bore, at least, an authorial stamp, as distasteful as I might find it; they were movies demonstrably made by someone--dare I say, an artist--with a unique vision. 17 years after ""Bad Boys II,"" this reboot follows a trend nowadays of reviving long-dormant series, including once again trotting out the aged cast to mingle with new characters, to attempt to brand them as franchises in the fashion of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. There are even mid-credits sequences here, for crying out loud--one of which is there explicitly to set up future projects. ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" (2015), Ghostbusters"" (2016), ""Halloween,"" ""Ocean's 8"" (both 2018), along with Arnold Schwarzenegger in yet another Terminator movie every few years, or Harrison Ford in another Indian Jones adventure are some other examples of this trend. Seems many don't mind that the movies tend to be rubbish.Sure, some of the jokes here are funny, but most of them aren't, and the action sequences aren't terrible, but in that respect it pales in comparison to the non-stop car chases of ""Bad Boys II."" Way too much exposition is required here for more than a couple chases and shootouts to be allowed. Inexplicably, some think it more interesting to learn an intricate and entirely new backstory for one of these cardboard-cutout characters than to see them driving cars around explosions for a couple hours. Not me. I don't like telenovelas and soap operas; I like them even less than Bay's senseless hyper machismo, although I'm glad to be rid of the homophobia, hints of racism and general misogyny of Bay's gaze from the first two movies. I'm not sure that jokes about wearing a condom when fornicating with a witch is necessarily progress, but I guess I'll take it over Bay's camera lingering on views of the posteriors of young women and girls while Will Smith and Martin Lawrence make a point of how heterosexual they are as though it were funny.Yet, in this and every other way, ""Bad Boys for Life,"" directed by others, is a derivative, watered-down imitation of Bay's style coupled with the same formulaic franchise building polluting most of cinema recently. Despite the praying of Lawrence's character, these two are still terrible detectives--assaulting witnesses, neglecting warrants and killing suspects rather than arresting them (not that they could convict them after all the laws they break to catch them anyways). They're only older and slightly gentler than before. Meanwhile, Miami remains blighted by an ugly orange-and-teal color scheme. Editing remains choppy, and the zooms, whip pans, low-angle slow motion and pauses for character posing is carried over from the Bay handbook. I had my hopes up when the duo seemed to finally being seriously discussing retirement in this one. They should already.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

Having grown up in the time period between the first in the franchise and this film I am really able to appreciate the real life timeline development of the characters. Knowing the difference between Will Smith and Martin Lawrence's characters you can see that this film perfectly depicts how they would have changed over the years. The film still has great chemistry between them, loads of action and the dry humour you would expect.

A long time gap since Bad Boys 2 which I still say was the best in the series out of the three. Cause of Michael Bay's over the top action and explosions. For good or worse, if your into Michael Bay's movies. The third movie is done by a direction Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah which the budget is a little smaller than the second movie. The action sequences are still exciting but a little under control with its still cinematography and less fast editing like the previous movie.The plot follows Detective Mike (Will Smith) and Marcus (Martin Lawrence) are still battling it out with retiring. Since Marcus is ready to call it quits after his daughter just had a baby. While Mike still wants to be in action in chasing bad guys. Meanwhile, Isabel (Kate del Castillo) breaks out of prison and has her son Armando (Jacob Scipio) assassinate several people and one of them being Mike. Since Isabel and Mike had some kind of history. She wants to tie all the loose ends. Which puts Mike and Marcus back into action and now working with a new team in their unit called AMMO led by Rita (Paola Nunez).The film is a lot of fun and has some fun humor with Mike and Marcus arguing with each other. Mike is still stuck in his old ways of doing things. Marcus is trying to find peace within himself. Mike is dragged back into action when his past catches up to him. With the villain this time wanting to get revenge. Mike and Marcus are teamed up with a new unit called AMMO which they approach things using technology like drones, using non lethal weapons, and strategizing. It was a fun team up with old school detectives being hands on, shoot first and ask questions later. Versus a team that tries to contain the damage than cause it.The film does have some exciting action sequences. A few car chases and motorcycle chases. And a climatic shoot out in an old building. May not be as crazy and over the top with its action like the second movie. It is still entertaining and exciting. And a lot of action if that is all your expecting in a Bad Boys movie.Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are great in delivering their characters. It is fun to see them back. And I would love to see more sequels if they can keep it exciting. Joe Pantoliano returns as their overreacting Captain. The new AMMO team that works with Mike and Marcus is lead by Rita (Paola Nunez), and her people Dorn (Alexander Ludwig), Rafe (Charles Melton), Kelly (Vanessa Hudgens). The AMMO team is a fun addition to the movie. The villains Kate del Castillo and Jacob Scipio being a mother/son duo was an interesting mix to the plot.Overall, Bad Boys for Life is a good action comedy. It has a lot of fun humor and action to make this movie worth seeing on the big screen. It may not be the best in the series. It definitely is a good comeback after a long time apart from the last movie.","19 out of 50 found this helpful.

My first takeaway is that it's mainly a mix of action and comedy, just like the first two ones but the chemistry between Mike Lowery (Will Smith) and Marcus Brunette (Martin Lawrence) is better than ever before, which is surprising considering they haven't been in Bad Boys since 2003 and Lawrence hasn't been too active for the past decade because of unfortunate family problems. This movie also eclipses the other ones because it has a much more structured plot and direction with were it wants to go. I don't want to give away too much detail with the plot but you're getting yourself mainly into any action movie with gunfights, chases and explosions and even though that may not necessarily sound appealing, it definitely feels better if you watch the first two movies to see what you're getting yourself into, but this could also be your first one and you'd still fit right in. The director for Bad Boys 1 & 2 was Michael Bay, who is known specifically for extreme quick action movies but in my opinion, the Rotten Tomato ratings were really harsh with 1 getting 43% and 2 getting just 23%! Now the new director duo, Bilall Fallah and Adil El Arbi, brought back some of Michael Bay's craziness but they also brought a new aspect were the movie isn't so one-dimensional anymore and has some real life problems that Mike and Marcus have to overcome, which makes it so much more satisfying. The ratings for this movie (76%) also might be so much more of a jump because past watchers feel nostalgic for this since it's been a 17 year wait. If you're going to watch this movie, I stress the fact that you shouldn't take this too seriously and only to watch just for enjoying it since thinking too much and maybe looking for plot holes will sour your experience. The way the movie ended, we might also have a fourth Bad Boys somewhere in the near future. Both of the main characters are facing hardships, with Marcus Brunette considering to retire from the police force after becoming a grandfather and deciding to focus on his family while Mike Lowery quickly realizes he's not what he once was, and he might have to leave too. They both feel really vulnerable which is definitely something that I wanted in the past movies since sometimes nothing felt like a threat to them. Their relationship was in deep trouble since they were clashing their ways of thought and what they've been doing throughout their whole lives. The support actors are really strong with the likes of Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig and Kate del Castillo who all did exceptional in their parts, with the past movies having Will and Martin taking too much of a portion. All in all, I would recommend watching this movie if you just want to have a good time and kick back for a classic. It's even better if you watched the former movies because this has been the best one yet!","18 out of 48 found this helpful.

The acting by the two lead actors seem routine and tired and the forced attempts to revive the chemistry and banter from previous films simply fails.
The story is way too predictable and generally disappointing.But what I found disgusting was the racism in the film.
Why did Will Smith's character espouse racist slurs on several occasions when his love interest is of the same race he slurs?
And why repeatedly play on outdated stereotypes about age?
In this day and age where we should do an effort to move beyond bigotry and racism, it's just awful, outdated and really really bad taste.This film should not have been made.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The first Bad Boys was born out of producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer will to create a blockbuster out of promising new talent. We had Martin Lawrence, Will Smith and Michael Bay all trying to prove themselves in what would be a career launching movie for almost all of them. It had a catchy title that made no sense, charismatic leads, a director with a great eye for action and all of them hungry for success. The second one was born out of arrogance. They all had established themselves as huge stars and just thought they could do whatever they wanted. It resulted in an insane movie with over the top action and no sense of direction, just the whim of stars who had no one to tell them no. This one is born out of desperation. Martin Lawrence's career didn't go anywhere, Will Smith has been struggling for the last few years and Michael Bay didn't even return to direct. So they took the lazy way out and made another Bad Boys movie. I never thought I would miss Michael Bay's directing, but I do, this one could've used his talent. I kinda feel bad for the duo directing this movie as they are probably talented as their Belgium work can attest, but the writing is just terrible with the new AMMO millennial team being the best example of all that is wrong with this movie.

It feels more of a fast and furious movie than a Bad Boys movie. The acting is bad, the story is terrible and predictable. There are so many things going on screaming unrealistic that you can't catch a break. It lost touch with reality unlike the previous movies and it became more of ""phone gets hacked in 3 seconds"" police tv show kind of movie.It is really a sequel that didn't need to happen but happened just to fool fans and grab their money.

""Whatcha gonna do when they come for you?"" In this third entry of the franchise, those song lyrics are what we are asking cocky and aging Miami detective Mike Lowery (Will Smith). An old case comes back to haunt him and a scorned lover comes back to hunt him, and he may or may not have his old reliable partner Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) by his side.It's been 25 years since director Michael Bay introduced us to 'Bayhem' with his first feature film, BAD BOYS. It took another 8 years for the sequel BAD BOYS II, and now 17 years later, we get this long-anticipated third film. Only instead of Michael Bay (who is listed as a producer and makes a cameo), Belgian directors (and former film school buddies) Adil El Arbi and Billal Fallah are directing. Fans of the franchise need not be worried, as the two expected and necessary elements are present: partner banter and Bayhem action.
Detective Mike Lowery (Smith) is an old school bull with a badge, and Detective Marcus Burnett (Lawrence) is simply ready to ride off into the sunset of retirement as Pop-Pop with family, including his new grandbaby. Also back for his third run with the bad boys is stressed out Captain Howard played by Joe Pantoliano and the ever-present Pepto Bismol.Isabel Aretas (Kate del Castillo) is sprung from jail in Mexico by her son Armando (Jacob Scipio). Mother and son have two missions: take back their drug cartel, and take revenge on those responsible for her arrest and the death of Isabel's husband. Oh yeah, Isabel is part-witch and a former lover of rookie cop Mike Lowery. What a tangled web ... and that's without including another surprise twist. Their revenge checklist includes many Miami dignitaries ... and a vow to make Lowery the last to die.There is another surprise near the beginning of the film, and that motivates Lowery to get involved to help solve the string of murders - not yet aware that he's on the list. Of course Detective Burnett is drawn out of retirement and they are forced to work with a new Special Forces team called AMMO. Surprisingly, neither of the 'Ms"" stand for Millennial, and instead it's Advanced Miami Metro Operations. The team is led by Rita (Paolo Nunez), another former Lowery lover, and includes badass Kelly (Vanessa Hudgens), hulky computer whiz Dom (Alexander Ludwig), and wise-cracking Rafe (Charles Melton) as a verbal sparring partner for Lowery.What follows is car chases, shootouts, fancy weapons, drones, and helicopters. And lots of one-liners at stressful moments. Lawrence is especially effective with the banter, and fans will be happiest when he and Smith are jabbing back and forth. This time, much of their grief towards each other focuses on mortality and growing old. The partners are close, but their life philosophies vary greatly. Of course we do get the fiery finale, and this one involves a helicopter and a stunning hotel that's been left in ruins.Chris Bremner, Peter Craig, and Joe Carnahan (originally slated to direct) wrote the script, and for the most part stays true to what the fans want - banter and action - while making note of the 17 years that have passed for these bad boys, ""Ride together. Die together"" always seemed like an absurd phrase for two cops, but the partner dynamics are in full force here, even though this movie (as well as the other two) are closer to live action cartoons than an actual police thriller. The end credits scene sets us up for BB4, and if they wait another 17 years, I calculate Will Smith will be 68 years old. Instead of a Porsche, he'll be driving a Buick.","12 out of 33 found this helpful.

If you've been a fan of this franchise for the last 25 years like myself, you'll notice some awesome call backs to the past films. The chemistry between Will Smith (Mike Lowrey) and Martin Lawrence (Marcus Burnett) is undeniable; they picked up right where they left off in 2003. It's unsurprising how hilarious this film is, as the 2 leads excel with their comedic timing; especially Martin. This is the funniest he's been in a long time; I now understand when Will said that Martin has the ability to be funny without losing the sincerity of the scene (paraphrasing); it's not forced but it flows well with the scene. What DID shock me is how emotional I got during a couple of scenes. When I say that, you may be thinking that Will was the one that made me tear up because he has the acting chops to invoke that emotion but you would be incorrect. It was actually Martin who had me teary-eyed in a few scenes, he dug deep and showed that he can play a dramatic role when he needs to. The action scene were great; it'll have you at the edge of your seat because, y'know, it's a Bad Boys film and the camera work in the 3rd act was amazing. This film will have you laughing, crying, angry, and there are some ""OH CRAP"" moments in there as well. It also builds towards an expansion of the franchise, which I'm all the way here for. I'm definitely going to be watching this film a few more times and will have a pre-order for the Blu-ray as soon as it becomes available. It's my favorite trilogy along with John Wick...Buy your tickets ASAP!!!","17 out of 49 found this helpful.

IT'S OVER!!!.... AND NAUSEATING!!!
ENOUGH!!!!
Sorry, but someone had to SHOUT IT!!!!
And now the review!!!
First time feature film directors have made a HORRIBLE movie!!!
There isn't room to go into how many levels this movie FAILS on!!!... however, for you eternal optimists, I'll list a few.
1. Unrealistic and I mean WHOLLY unbelievable storyline!!!
2. Sub-par script.... Absolutely failed to coax ANY humor out of the ""Dynamic Duo"".... Truly... It's EMBARRASSINGLY BAD!!!
3. Uninspired acting.... Martin Lawrence looks and acts like he's late for bed or has just woken, but hasn't had his morning cup of ""joe"" yet!!!... Will Smith looks as though he's about to collapse... Everyone else just acts like they're under the influence of large doses of cough syrup!!!
4. Amateurish scene designs!!!.... The scenes come off looking like a television with the contrast setting cranked all the way up.... the brights are blinding and the darks are black... Very annoying!!!.... However, not nearly as bothersome as the overuse of colored lightening and this strange haze that seems to permeate most action sequences!!!.... Why is there pink powder exploding in an automotive repair shop???
Oh heck.... I mean... ETC. ETC. ETC. ... IT JUST GOES ON AND ON AND ON..... DON'T BELIEVE THE ""10"" REVIEWS!!!
Y'all are smart enough to know those are used to BOO$T a rating for commercial proposes and are BOGU$.... RIGHT???
Okay then.... TRUTH???... When the hype is over and the receipts are counted, this movie will be declared a flop!!!.... and RIGHTLY so!!!!
Hollywood is on a losing streak like I've never seen before.... C'MON GUYS!!!.. ONE GOOD MOVIE... PLEASE!!!!","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Supporting actors spoil the broth.

More bad: it lasts too long. What is it these days that all these action pictures last 2 hours or more? Unless the movie is rock solid gold, I get bored after 90 minutes...The good: same old, same old. You get a rehashed version of the same Bad Boys movies that came before and it does beat staring at the wallpaper. Not to be too harsh, it is an average formula action movie and with a lot of coke and popcorn it is a reasonably enjoyable action movie.Suited for who? Of course entirely suited for the old Bad Boy fans, who undoubtedly will be disappointed. Younger fans might simply be bored.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was really good to see them together again.

However after watching this film, felt that this was another film from the 1990's to adapt to the current new age era. The original was released in 1995 with the second film eight years later in 2003. Now it's seventeen years later from the second to this third instalment.The action is solid as they do in these films but nothing exactly stood out in terms of great over the top action scenes.Years later, the chemistry between both Will Smith and Martin Lawrence is still there but a lot of the back and forth banter is just tiresome and irritating. Lawrence is incredibly more annoying here than he was in the previous films.Also the constant callbacks to the Bad Boys theme song with the characters singing the song and alluding to it was off putting. It was okay one time but it was a running gag continuity throughout the entirety of the film and the more it went, the more annoying it became. This was simply a nostalgia technique to make fans reminisce but one didn't find it humorous.The third act twist was intriguing but something to add to make it more worthwhile. Ultimately it was predictable and felt forced.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A Rare Long-Delayed Sequel That Knows How to Pay Homage While Still Being Entertaining","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5418270/?ref_=tt_urv","CANpatbuck3664","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur63857399/?ref_=tt_urv","18 January 2020","The previous movies were so bombastic and fantastical that someone making it more serious would have been a disservice. Bad Boys for Life plays with the action where they don't re-write the book but it has the same flavour and they were pretty inventive. Are the action scenes silly? Absolutely, during an action scene, someone bumps the separated passenger car from a motorcycle to avoid an RPG missile being fired from a helicopter while the passenger cs firing a minigun that's mounted to the car. You're either going to think that's hilarious or the dumbest thing you've ever heard. But that's one of the reasons I love Bad Boys 2 so much, you just surrender to the ridiculous nature of it and it becomes a ""how can they top that?!"" situation from scene to scene. But the action is well choreographed and decently shot in Bad Boys for Life. Its surprisingly brutal at points too, character are ended and blood sprays everywhere! I don't remember that in the previous entries so much but it was a good decision to swerve into the R rating instead of having one foot in the Pg-13 area too.When you're making a sequel, a well placed callback is an art. Make it too obvious and people roll their eyes, too subtle and they miss it (and people later complain if the team even watched the old movies... I blame the Star Wars fandom for this). Even the biggest of the big budget movies fall flat on their face trying to do this sometimes but the creative team on this movie played their cards just right. I would be about to complain about something not being carried over from the original movies, they would make note of it. Something would be too crazy or unbelievable, Martin Lawrence would crack a joke. I'd lean in to whisper a line from one of the other movies, Will Smith would reference it. Not all the jokes work but overall this is a pretty polished script for an action movie. The dialogue is funny, the story is easy to comprehend and we get some more growth for Marcus and Mike without it being groan inducing. I tip my hat to the writers and the director for making a pretty tight movie.I can't tell you how refreshing it was to see the our comic duo back to their old tricks. I was really impressed with Will Smith specifically, he slipped back into this role seamlessly. He managed to pull off Mike Lowrey but he regained his charm and his ability to be funny. I like him as a more dramatic performer but it brought a huge smile to my face to see him in this kind of movie again. Martin Lawrence has never been a thespian and while he retains his comedic chemistry with Smith, this might have been the movie where I truly noticed how uncomfortable he is as an actor. I didn't hate his performance and he was very funny but where Will can hit the more serious notes on the scale, its just not his forte. The performance that really captured my attention was Paola Nunez as Rita. She knew how to play this type of role without being corny but she still sprinkled in some humour. She had solid rapport with the rest of the cast, she performed her action beats (I can't speak to how many or what stunts she did) capably and was able to keep up the femme fatale nature of her character. I'm going to remember her going forward. Alexander Ludwig, Vanessa Hudgens and Charles Melton were all good, Ludwig has a couple of funny scenes and while Hudgens isn't give much room to stretch, she accomplishes what she needs to with the material that she was given. Joe Pantoliano is a cartoon character but he got a couple of chuckles out of me and his character has always been broad so it at least was consistent with the rest of the franchiseThe villains are still the backseat characters in this but I liked what they chose to do with them. I can't get too far into it without venturing into spoiler territory, the arc isn't new but I thought the execution elevated the material. Its actually a pretty tired trope with them being out for revenge but much like the rest of the movie, there was an inspired effort to sell it. They're easily the most well defined and human antagonists in the franchise. Their motivations are clear (even if we run into the same old crap about them having the ability to win but putting it off so the heroes must ""suffer"") and Bad Boys for Life script was smart enough to underscore the drama but to make fun of itself in small doses later. A couple of Marcus' one-liners about them really got me laughing. So in a movie that had all the warning signs about just functioning as a cash grab, this was another area where I was thankful that they didn't just phone it in.This movie could have been a true disaster. Long gestating sequels are busts 9/10 times, there were several different writers and directors cycling in and out of this project and neither Will or Martin are at the top of their games anymore. But if someone is looking for a blueprint or a reference guide on how to make a sequel years later to a popular project, this could be used. They callback to the previous movies when its appropriate and its never frustrating or lazy. On top of that, there's some exciting action, Will and Martin are right back in the swing of things and the script is pretty sharp (for the genre). It could have been even better yet but I went in with low expectations (the trailer was a mixed bag at best) and I walked out happy that I took the time to go to the theatre to see this. Bad Boys 2 is one of my favourite guilty pleasure movies so its hard to top but Bad Boys for Life is a fun trip back to that period in action movies (late 1990s- early 2000s) and I thoroughly enjoyed myself. It would actually grade out between an 8 and a 9/10 but its still not a fantastic movie so I'll round down. If you're looking for something undemanding and still fun or if you fondly remember the previous movies, this is worth checking out in the theatre.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

If you are new to the BBF, then you will ALSO LOVE THIS FILM.This film has simply has it all:
This movie is just over 2 hours long and you know it is a good movie when the time passes by and you are stunned thinking ""can I have more?"". The plot wasn't exactly great but this is my being overcritical; it was good enough to carry the film over but with powerful performance from Will Smith and Martin Lawrence you know they will steal the show. This is not to discount the supporting new cast, and some old, to which they all helped to build this into a near perfect film.The narrative continues pretty much from where we left off from BB2 but the story and the cast have gotten older and wise (ummmm!) and sillier. For me the standout performance was MARCUS (Martin Lawrence), I am not sure what wavelength this guy was on but boy did he put the BAD in Bad Boys for Life.10/10 go in and enjoy this film :)","13 out of 50 found this helpful.

And it's not that the previous two were such cinematic masterpieces, but the point is they're really fast fun flicks that you can wholeheartedly enjoy without having to squirm in your chair or feel stupid for watching it.
Not with this one. Jesus Christ, Martin Lawrence doesn't deserve this. After all he's been through, to turn him into a has-been with this title is just inhumane to the guy. First half hour was the longest half hour I've had in years. Exposition, exposition, exposition, shaky camera action sequence. Then more exposition, even more exposition, the mother of all that is exposition, and then another shaky cam action sequence.
The dialogue is trash. It's Netflix-tier. And whoever wrote the script decided that the most relatable thing to do is to just throw a bunch of pointless and irrelevant mentions of youtube and 4chan, which is just awkward to sit through.
Add toxic sarcasm, cheap moments, ""jokes"" that could only be followed by cricket noise and, as I already said, unnecessary exposition, and you feel like you're sitting through a powerpoint presentation, rather than an actual movie.
It's not that Will Smith doesn't still have it. It's not that Martin Lawrence isn't still funny (which he absolutely is). It's not that Joe Pantoliano's rage isn't wonderful. It's just that they handed the rights over to some young amateurs with handheld cameras and said ""here's a bunch of money, film this fanfiction"".
It's horrible. There isn't a single original thing in this movie and the few moments that actually manage to get a genuine laugh out of the audience are immediately followed by garbage.
Hollywood used to be beautiful, man...","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

More times than not they don't. The actors have usually aged so much that they struggle to pull off the same characters and they've often lost a lot of their chemistry as they've changed as actors/people over the years. 'Bad Boys for Life' doesn't seem to have suffered from any of those problems. Being cops allows the actors to age and still be believable as their characters, and Will Smith and Martin Lawrence have such strong chemistry that even if they did lose some of it over the years there would still be more than enough left over.The thing I loved most about this movie was that the villains were genuinely menacing. There's a great prison break scene at the beginning that sets the tone perfectly, and let's the audience know that these are extremely dangerous people not to be messed with. Once you have an interesting antagonist the rest of the film just takes care of itself.The only faults I'd suggest with the film are that the amount of time Lawrence's character spends not wanting to be a part of the police side of things is too long. It drags the film down while it's happening, and while I get that that's what his character is about, I still think the film would have been stronger without it. Also it felt like too often the day was saved by someone else popping up out of nowhere at exactly the right moment. Otherwise though I had a really good time with this movie. It was funny, action-packed and had a great plot. This is one not to be missed.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

A dead one.
I watched the first 2, back in the day, on DVD, when there were no other new releases to watch. Sadly, somehow, this is not even on a par with those. I really like Will Smith. But..he does not need the money and I never took him for one for the attention. Clearly, I was wrong. Nothing to say about the film, because there is nothing to it. If you are going to spend 50-100 million on a film, can you at least spend $500 on the script?
Embarrassing. I originally gave this movie a 5, because I like Will Smith and because for some reason this became a trilogy...and I would be a hypocrite, since I have now seen all 3.
Hope we can officially call them Bad Movies. Even Inner Circle deserve better. Thought COPS was bad enough. What are you going to do when they name another movie-thing after you?
Inner Circle and cinema audiences, the real victims. Shame this movie did not come out a few months later, when the world ended up in lockdown.

In general I like this kind of movies, enjoyed the first two. The score for this one is an insult to the original ones. Anything above 6 points seems like a paid review. I don't like to rant so I'll keep this short.Very bad CGI. CGI used for no reason, like why do you need CGI for a simple fight scene? Like a REALLY simple one, two guys just punching each other and chasing for a bit. Two stunt man would do perfectly here with much better results. CGI fire everywhere.No humor, the jokes were just bad, did not land or didn't make sense.On the same line the scrip was super bad, dialogues seemed forced.Plot, like whatever , it could be OK if everything else was better. It's not a movie that is supposed to make you wonder what's next etc. But the background story of the whole situation doesn't make sense if you watched the other two movies.Will Smith did a great job but could not save this project. The best part of the movie was to hear the song again. All the rest was a bad joke. Like they did not have the time to work on it and make it watchable, as it's not.Two stars, one for Will and one for the song. No idea how anyone can give this 10, even as a joke.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The actors were simply not ready to be back on the screen for a kind of production that had so much potential which has all gone down the drain.In a time where expectations of the audience and the competition with good actors in the market are both high, Will Smith should know when to resign and perhaps retire. You are simply not doing your past success any justice by throwing away so much investment in such roles with a performance like this. I won't even get started on Venessa Hudgens' unnecessary involvement on here.Also, producers should also know it takes more than a successful old title to simply reboot it years later. Storyline was no less than pathetic and a genuine waste of time. There was 13 of us watching it on a saturday night and honestly we could not wait for the credits to roll.Overall, bad acting, poor storyline, weak supporting roles, pathetic comedy okay maybe a few good action scenes but they are too filled with unnecessary cringeworthy jokes. Please stop rebooting good titles like Bad Boys and Charlie's Angels because they not only turn out to be a waste of investment for producers but also a disappointment for it's audience.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Michael Bay is still a producer on this third instalment, that initially launched his career as a director of highly explosive action blockbusters, but it's Belgian directing duo Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah who get a shot at directing their first big budget Hollywood film.One last ride, but the stakes are higher than ever. They gained a bit of weight, their hair lost its colour and they're ready to retire. When we meet our bickering partners in crime, Miami P.D. detective duo Mike Lowrey (Smith) and Marcus Bennett (Lawrence) are on their way to the hospital to meet Marcus' first grandchild. At the same time, Isabel ""La Bruja"" Aretas (Kate del Castillo), violently escapes from prison and takes control over a Miami-based cartel, pulling the strings via her son Armando (Jacob Scipio). What happens later that night back in Miami, all links back to the Miami police force and will change our buddies' lives forever.Bad Boys For Life has been in the works for over a decade. The script was never good enough for our stars to sign up for, but in hands of Joe Carnahan (Narc), Peter Craig (The Town) and first time screenplay writer Chris Bremner, we get a fast paced, action packed and to the brim filled with jokes story that keeps your attention for the full two hours. Even when not every joke lands, the chemistry Smith and Lawrence bring back to the screen, that feels particularly nostalgic to fans of the previous two films, is endearing and smile inducing.Lawrence hasn't been in a lot of films for the big screen in the last 10 years, after his own Big Momma-franchise bit the dust in 2011. Seeing him come back to form in a graceful way that reminds us of his comedy heydays, is a warm reminder of his talent, that will make you want to rewatch his older hits. It's great to see Smith back in an action comedy, when it also looks like he's having a lot of fun on set. His Mike is the main star of this story, who also gets an eye-opening third act that hints at a possible fourth film. And if this chapter does well, why wouldn't the studio try and make this into the franchise it so desperately always could have been.A bunch of new side characters get introduced, most of them in the form of younger team members on the squad. Each one of them has a well rounded personality, yet lacks a bit of background in why they act the way they do. Besides Vikings' Alexander Ludwig as bouncer-turned-IT-pro, which comes across a bit awkward - but that's part of the gag - and team leader Rita (Paola Nuñez) who's had a romantic past with Mike. Joe Pantoliano is back as the foulmouthed loud Captain Howard, stealing every scene he's in, while the fresh new British actor Jacob Scipio, who plays bad guy Armando, knows how to command your attention with his piercing eyes and stand tall next to well known actors such as Smith.What especially stands out is how different yet classy the action sequences are compared to Bay's typical style of explosive car wrecking highway car chase kind of ""Bayhem"". Particularly the whimsical yet stylish cinematography by Robrecht Heyvaert (Adil and Bilall's 'Black') combined with Lorne Balfe's (Mission: Impossible - Fallout) rousing score in one scene that starts of in a club, to then evolve smoothly into a car chase to then turn into a gunfight and motorbike-explosive-neon-lit-extravaganza, is extremely well choreographed and reminiscent of last year's John Wick 3's horse riding motorbike chase through New York. The thrilling action pieces blend well with the enormous amount of one liners and throwbacks to earlier chapters. A few shocking unexpected moments will have you gasp for air, while surprising cameos are there to amp up laughter.Bad Boys For Life is a successful international feature debut for Adil and Bilall, who - after witnessing this - could possibly revive a franchise like Beverly Hills Cop any day now. All thrills and gags, without ever toning down the gore and profanity, this chapter is without a doubt the strongest and most engaging one out of the trilogy. An action comedy that delivers on every level.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Ever since it came out, I've been using the term ""bad boys 2 effect"" to describe franchises that became better by becoming much dumber like the fast and furious movies and independence day.I was hoping for the same trademark Michael Bay chaos, fittingly christened ""Bayhem"" by media critics, to find out to my dismay that Bay wasn't in the driver's seat this time, instead he was replaced by a duo of Indie film makers that chose to stage this movie with more restraint, which was a bad choice from the start. This series doesn't work in third gear.In the beginning the flabbergasting attempt to tell a more mature cop drama inbetween Will Smith action posing for instagram stories almost works, but the makers wanted to have their cake and eat it too. The movie thus alternates between dramatic moments of death, vulnerability and a very shy non-committed look at toxic masculinity, and the inappropriate non-sequitur humour Michael Bay properties are known for. In the end, neither works and the drama falls as flat as the jokes. The confused tone isn't even consistent between characters in scenes themselves. It feels like all the actors separately were supposed to get cue cards on whether to act funny, cool or dramatic in a scene but an assistant accidentally scrambled them all beforehand and was too scared to tell anyone.There isn't really much here to draw your interest, neither in fluff or substance. The story is thin, acceptable for an episode of a tv series maybe, the action is mediocre and unimaginative, the visuals are repetitious and uncreative (I appreciate the effort to make yellow the new ""in"" colour but nobody's going to take inspiration from this film) and the acting is really off. Didn't these characters used to have chemistry? Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are back together after 17 years and they look like they'd rather be anywhere else doing their taxes.Look, I kinda hate Michael Bay, most of his films are bordering on unwatchable but his frat-boy-with-the-heart-of-a-teenager hand was desperately needed here. His films, more often to their own detriment than not, are made with maximum visual impact in mind. They are loud, expensive, dumb and extreme. They're almost a hundred percent icing with sparse crumbs of cake, but if you like icing at least you get a lot of bang for your buck. Bad Boys 3 in contrast is a bit more crumb with sparse icing. Either go full on action schlock or do a serious crime drama, you can't do both at the same time in such a borderline passive way and expect to swoon an audience.I mean what's even up with that title anyway? Bad Boys 4 life is the title you use for the fourth part not the third one. Try harder, think dumber!","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Personally, I think it helps the movie that it was NOT directed by Michael Bay!! You can actually see what happening during the action. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence are so good together, I love their chemistry. Lawrence does not kook as heavy as he does in the trailer either. Sadly the line I hated from the trailer ""We're not just black... We are cops too!!"" made it in to the movie.There Are one cool action sequences but nothing really stands out. There was some dodgy CGI at times (maybe 3 or 4) during the action scenes, but it's a minor gripe.I liked the villains, a lot more than the two drug dealers from the first two movies. Joe Pantoliano steals all his scenes as per usual. Vanessa Hudgens was fine as was Paola Nunez and Alexander Ludwig.There was something I hated and there is something at the end, that I thought was cheesy as hell and I just didn't buy this change from a certain character!! Its my biggest problem with the movie.There is a post credit scene that hints at a Bad Boys 4, but it won't be the Bad Boys that we know.","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

That's 2 hours i lost in my life. The producers and writers need to find another job. Damn.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Much more Good rather than Bad. Let's get the bad out of the way first.Bad Points:° For the first third of the movie none of the jokes landed and I put my hand on my forehead and hoped to God it would pick up jokes wise° Martin looked terrible but I understand that he couldn't workout to get in shape for the movie° I feel AMMO were slightly underutilized° The Captain Howard issueGood Points:° Some of the jokes after the first third had the theatre bursting out with laughter, some of the loudest laughs I have heard in awhile. (I'ma penetrate this man's soul with my heart) 😁😆😂° The Villain was Super cool, I mean he had Flavour pouring out of him. Everything he did was smooth. There is a scene with him and a group, it was Super Cool.° The Whole feel of the movie radiated Vibrancy and Colour 🌉, it was very easy on the eye🎉° Some of the Action scenes were Amazingly Impressive, a slow motion scene with Will on a bike which was astounding, a scene near the end of the movie where the camera is innovatively used with Paola Nunez and also a scene near the end where the camera is used greatly again with the Villain and his Mother° The soundtrack had a great set piece theme, specifically the bike chasing the helicopter theme° Paola Nunez is Super Hot in this movie 💖As a movie on it's own it is a 7 but I had an incredible crowd and the theatre was on fire once it got going and for that reason plus the Realization of the Good points, it's an 8 for me.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

I remember that year like yesterday. A friend invited me to see this movie with friends and family on his birthday. Unfortunately I couldn't go but the fascination with the movie stayed especially when Diana King's song Shy Guy was playing on television all the time and I love that song. Still one of my favorite songs of all time and it was great marketing for the movie. I eventually saw the movie and luckily it didn't disappoint. The hype around the movie remained. Bad Boys was a classic and every year Will and Martin would get asked to make a new movie together.I don't remember much about part 2. I believe I generally liked it but it wasn't as good as part 1. In part 1 the dynamics were the best. Everybody was memorable. In this part I also feel like with part 2 it's mainly Mike & Marcus stealing the show.
I thought the villains were terrible in this movie. The storyline regarding the bad guys was absurd and easily the worst aspect of the movie. It made the movie feel generic in some ways.The thing that I loved was the dynamic between Mike & Marcus. The jokes were hilarious and gives big nostalgia vibes. It was enough for me to like the movie. Not only the jokes between them but with the supporting characters worked very well.Overall I think it's worth the watch if you're a fan of the franchise and don't expect too much.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

You can definitely tell that Martin hasn't been doing any kind of acting for a while and as the movie gets going he starts to find his grove and get alot more comfortable. Will came ready for this and did his thing i would say.
Overall this Movie met my expectations and they did a great Job. Straight up i would give this movie a 7 but because they produced a movie 17 years later that didnt suck i gave it a solid 8.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The action otherwise is cheesy with bad guys standing waiting to be shot or hit and thousands of rounds missing the good guys when just one bullet from a bouncing Smith finds its mark. Why are Mexicans the only bad guys around? How does Smith, an average beat cop, afford all these expensive cars? I guess the bling is an attempt at ratings.

It was hilarious and the two leads had terrific chemistry. It was dIrected by pre Transformers Michael Bay. Very sleek and cool looking but not so over the top that it was tiresome. The action was cool, but the film was very funny. Then came Bad Boys. I hated it!!! It was an unrestrained Michael Bay over the top film that he just can't help himself make when he's got free rayne. It was watchable only because of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence but it wasn't nearly as funny as the first one. Then came the trailer for Bad Boys For Life and I was sceptical. 3rd parts are usually very weak messes and it had been 17 years since the second film. Also, to release it in January which is usually a sign that a studio does not have confidence in the film. I was not expecting much.Well I am glad that I was wrong. Bad Boys For Life is definitely better than the second and as good as the first one!!! It is the funniest film of it's kind I've seen in a long time. Will Smith and Martin Lawrence return as Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett and are as good as they have ever been. Their chemistry is still there after almost 20 years. Of course it is a buddy cop action film, but it us primarily a laugh out loud comedy. It is the type of film that gets so many laughs that you can't hear some of the dialogue after. It is hilarious!!! The film is directed by Bilall Fallah and Adil El Arbi. They do take a bit from the Michael Bay school of action but even though it's sleek and frenetic it isn't as over the top and exhausting as what Michael Bay does. That is a good thing. The story is standard for the franchise. Marcus and Mike team up to get a drug lord that is out for revenge. The heavy is played by Kate Del Castillo as a wife of a Mexican drug lord who wants to avenge her husband death. She is very good. She sends her son to Miami to kill those involved in his father's death. The thing that the film does best apart from the comedy is that it flashes out the characters of Mike and Marcus well. We care about these guys and you could see they care about each other. Will Smith is a much bigger star but the film's biggest laughs belong to Martin Lawrence. He is so funny as Marcus that he steals every scene. Will Smith is the straight man in this duo. Also, it was great to see Joe Pantoliano as Conrad. He also brings laughs and needed weight to the story. Is it great? No. But in a time where sequels are so common that they are instantly forgettable it is pleasantly surprising to see a sequel.that really tries to entertain. And this one does!

"5","/10","If you go to the film theater with basic expectations of having fun, Bad Boys For Life gives you that, so I recommend it.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5412607/?ref_=tt_urv","msbreviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur79118814/?ref_=tt_urv","16 January 2020","If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)I was never a big fan of the Bad Boys films. Firstly, I'm not too fond of Michael Bay as a director (as a producer, he's fine). The way he directs his action sequences is incredibly choppy, filled with questionable CGI, very hard to follow, and we all know his passion for exploding everything. Oh, and I can't forget about the constant product placement (amazing how in a brutal explosion, everything is destroyed except a gorgeous-looking Audi car that remains intact). Secondly, the storytelling always felt extremely generic and unsurprising. So, obviously, my expectations weren't very high...Maybe that's why I enjoyed Bad Boys For Life way more than I anticipated. This movie should be a lesson to the Fast and Furious franchise. To make a mindless entertaining action flick, the lighthearted tone has to be well-established from the get-go. Despite the fact that the third act deals with absurd emotional twists worthy of a Mexican soap opera, the screenwriters are able to find just the right amount of harmless fun. I didn't watch a single clip before the film, and ten minutes in, I acknowledged that its goal was to simply be entertaining without taking itself too seriously.Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah balance the more dramatic family issues with the ludicrous action very well. The latter sequences are much better than Bay's. The car chases, even when containing a few too many cuts, are relatively easy to follow, and they pack that necessary adrenaline rush. There are a few surprising shootouts that are filmed to make them look like one take, which definitely brings something pretty uncommon to this kind of formulaic action movies. Technically, I think both directors did an excellent job, especially considering that this was their debut feature film.However, the story brings everything down. I believe Mexican soap operas might have better scripts. The dialogue reaches such a cringe-worthy level. Every essential plot information is given either through lazy character interactions or by that magical computer that every generic action movie possesses with which the main characters can basically know everything about everyone at the click of a few buttons. The comedy is quite hit-and-miss to me, a lot of the jokes didn't land, but some did make me chuckle. Overall, the screenplay is as cliche as it could be, and that last shot... I hate it. In the end, it's the cast who saves the boring narrative.Will Smith and Martin Lawrence share fantastic chemistry, and their banter is always entertaining to watch, even if it isn't as hilarious as it could be. I liked Lawrence more than Smith, maybe due to the non-action, family comedy bits that worked seamlessly. Nevertheless, it's dumb fun, and it's plainly visible that the actors had a blast shooting this movie. The whole cast transfer the joy that they had on set to the screen, and it's pretty noticeable. Watching Alexander Ludwig (Dorn) outside Vikings is always a pleasure (I so wish that he gets more important roles in the future), and the whole AMMO team (Vannesa Hudgens, Charles Melton, Paola Nunez) is all compelling enough, even if the characters are two-dimensional.It's simple: whether you enjoy the Bad Boys saga or not, this is undoubtedly the best installment of the franchise. If you go to the film theater with basic expectations of having fun, Bad Boys For Life gives you that, so I recommend it. It's a pure popcorn-entertainment action flick with recognizable actors who all share great chemistry. With Michael Bay out of the director helm, Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah deliver surprisingly good action sequences, considering this is their debut feature film. The formulaic, cliche, soap opera story is straight-up ridiculous at some points, and it carries such an aura of predictability that when it tries to introduce an emotional twist, it merely becomes absurd. The last shot feels like a call to Hollywood to make more sequels, which sort of ruins the whole ""Bad Boys one last time"" tagline... I'm extremely undecided on which side this review should fall, so I'll base my decision on the answer to the following question: ""Am I going to (want to) see this movie again or another sequel?"" Honestly... no.Rating: C+","5 out of 27 found this helpful.

While it didn't make a huge dent in the box office back in 1995, the first Bad Boys film is now revered by some as one of director Michael Bay's better films. That's not exactly what I believe, but there are some massive fans of these movies out there. I enjoyed one and two for what they were, but I never felt the need to rewatch them over and over. Upon the initial release of Bad Boys for Life, nearly 17 years since the release of Bad Boys II, I decided to revisit the previous two films. I still find them to be very entertaining, but lacking in many other areas. Maybe that's why this review may seem almost too positive for a film like this, but it's been a long time since a franchise has turned itself around this well.Bad Boys for Life picks up in real-time, 17 years after the events of the previous film and nearly the entire cast has returned, which was nice to see. Marcus wishes to actually retire this time and the violence is what is keeping Mike going. Due to some unexpected circumstances, a vengeance plot is set in motion, which finds them on the hunt for the Aretas family. With a lot more drama than the last two to really make you care about these characters, this film, in terms of characters and story, is eons better than anything presented in the last two.In many ways, Bad Boys for Life is the Fast Five of this franchise. It took the existing characters that you know from previous films, introduced a new team, made the family and friend aspect very strong, and those aspects in turn just made for a more enjoyable experience. It's still filled with cliches and moments that make you roll your eyes, but if the rest of the movie is well done, sometimes those moments can be likeable. It sounds weird to say this about a Bad Boys film, but I found myself shocked or feeling emotional on a few occasions, due to the plot twists. I didn't expect this movie to connect with me as much as it did, but I had a blast with it.In terms of new direction, it was nice to see Michael Bay stand back and support a new vision. Directed by the duo of Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah, they presented a film that was not short on action but also felt very laid back in comparison to the previous films, which also worked with the story, as Mike and Marcus are now ageing. Most of their work is on foreign projects that I have not seen, but I may actually seek some of it out. These two guys seem to be very talented behind the camera. I will gladly see another Bad Boys movie, directed by them or anyone else, as long as they stick to this new direction.I didn't bother mentioning Will Smith or Martin Lawrence off the top, because if you're a fan of either of them and like the last two films, then there's no change here. They both share the same charisma and chemistry that they did over 20 years ago and I don't see that going away any time soon. Bad Boys for Life injects drama into an overblown action franchise and grounds it in reality. I can actually see newcomers liking this one more than the previous films and due to some new backstory revealed throughout this movie, the previous two aren't exactly necessary, even though there are some great callbacks sprinkled throughout. I would definitely recommend checking this one out, especially if you liked the last two. This is a much better movie than I was expecting.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Although the first two movies were hit success, it was only because of the chemistry between Will Smith and Martin Laurence. Bay's humour is non existent, the bad guys are one dimensional cartoon villains and and some gags, especially in the second one, were obscenely sexist and homophobic.Now directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah , this one has far more going for it than any thing in the first two movies. The villains are far more nuanced with the motivation of revenge, the stakes are higher and the heroes - unlike many other older men in action sequels - deal with old age. Marcus is ready to retire while Mike still wants to chase the game. There is a hilarious montage in which Mike puts on flashy suits to go interrogate some snitches, while Marcus rests compfortably in his recliner chair in his dressing gown. In both instances, things don't exactly go down as they intended.I really enjoyed this movie. Which is saying a lot since many of Will Smith's movies of late - as well as other action films - have let me down. So this was nice change.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Twenty-five years later, seventeen after the second film, Smith and Lawrence are back with Bad Boys For Life, this time though with no Bayhem in tow.When Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) is targeted by a demon from his past, he and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence), who he's dragged out of retirement, must team up for one last ride together. The trouble is, are their old school ""Bad Boys"" tactics much use in today's world?Leaving it so long to do a third film is something that could have backfired however, thanks to the chemistry shared by Smith and Lawrence, Bad Boys For Life is very much worth the wait, the two of them throwing themselves into proceedings with the same passion and ferocity as before. The pair of them just bounce off each other so well, Smith's more serious approach combining to hilarious results with Lawrence's comedic performance, as it always been.What the franchise had been missing before was a sense of consequence to the pair's often reckless approach to cleaning up the streets. Thankfully this is something Bad Boys For Life brings to the franchise and it makes for much more emotional and satisfying ride, with something at stake rather than just mindless action.The notable absence of Michael Bay behind the camera is a blessing in disguise for the film as well, with Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah delivering pulsating and coherent action sequences that hark back to the 90s era of action movies, which was a prime decade for the genre. Lorne Balfe's work on the film's score accompanies the action quite brilliantly also, which goes a long way in giving the film more energy.Bad Boys For Life may be the third film in a franchise some may have forgotten about being dropped in January, which is sometimes seen as a studio dumping ground however, it turns out to be the first surprise of the year and the best of the trilogy at the same time.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","The best Bad Boys movie so far","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7483672/?ref_=tt_urv","kingofdanerds","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur123289852/?ref_=tt_urv","26 October 2021","Fans of 90's action fondly remember the 1995 film Bad Boys and the same goes for the sequel, Bad Boys II. 17 years after Bad Boys II, we get the third installment titled Bad Boys for Life, released in 2020. While the first two films were directed by Michael Bay, this film is directed by Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah and stars Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. The film was a critical and financial hit. With critics, this is the best reviewed film in the series. The film was a surprise hit considering it was released in January. The film came out a couple months before the COVID 19 pandemic, so while it was a box office hit then, I can only imagine what more money it would have gotten without COVID.Mike Lowry and Marcus Burnett are getting older, having been together for 25 years on the force. Marcus (Martin Lawrence) plans on retiring but when a Mexican cartel tries to take out Mike (Will Smith), Mike and Marcus get together for one last time.I do like the Bad Boys movies. They aren't perfect by any means, but they do have entertainment value of which I can easily return to a lot. It is nice to see Lawrence and Smith back on screen together after so long and they do not disappoint. Lawrence's character, Marcus, is a cop that has matured and knows that it is time to retire and live life whereas Smith's character, Mike, has not grown up or matured. This is all executed fairly well and adds more to the characters of Mike and Marcus. As always, Lawrence and Smith play off of each other fairly well and gets some pretty good laughs throughout the entirety of the film. With the first two films, both Lawrence and Smith shared the screen equally, but here, it is made clear that Smith is the star. Which, doesn't sit too well with me. I would rather prefer that both Lawrence and Smith were the big stars and less focus on Smith, even though Smith is a badass as always. There are these new characters that are apart of this police program called AMMO. A few of the characters are interesting but some of them are hardly developed. The action in the first film was over the top but fun but while not as over the top this time around, we still get some pretty good action scenes here. I also find the film a bit more violent this time around with more blood being seen throughout the film. There are at least two moments where the film does surprise me and I do not want to give anything away but they really come out of nowhere and just surprise the hell out of me. The first two films never did anything like that. The villains are better this time around. The first two films had generic foreign bad guys that kidnap a girl and it is up to Mike and Marcus to save her and take out the bad guy. This time around it is different because the villain is a bit more personal to the characters, which ups the intensity and stakes for the characters.I think this film benefited from the fact that it was 17 years since the previous film. This time gap allows the writers to expand upon the characters a bit more and that is what I find to be this film's strongest part. For those that are fans of the previous two films, this film gives you what you like most out of those films.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

But this? The humour is bad to the point of embarrassing, with Martin Lawrence being worst of all, his jokes are just cringing. Maybe if you're 12 years old and this was the first action comedy you saw, you'd find it funny, but for grownups with a little more experience, not so much. Even the action scenes are lacking, with an almost total lack of realism. One can accept the disregard for the laws of physics, with unlimited bullets and no recoil, the bullet proof tables and other silly stuff, but it's just too much overall. Also, the support characters are nothing but cardboard characters, with the exception of Joe Pantoliano. All inn all, the film is approaching level terrible, and this being one of the most watched movies of 2020 is just sad. I read that director Adil El Arbi have been picked to direct Beverly Hills Cop 4. Now that is one movie I intend to skip.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

However that does't mean that this is bad movie by any means.Highly enjoyed things like the action and comedy. My complaints about the film would be about pacing for starters felt couple times in it like scenes dragged bit and didn't even really need to be in there. I also felt the chemistry between the two main characters wasn't as fluent as it was in previous films.My only other complaint had to do with the excessive use of side characters. This is more suppose to be buddy cop film but it didn't feel that way because it was bogged down by them and they personally detracted from the story bit.Overall this was still very good flick and def think whether you're fan of the series or not they'll still be fun to had.","2 out of 14 found this helpful.

He is terrible in this movie, very cringeworthy stuff. Martin Lawrence is great as always, and it's good to see him back. Joey Pants is good, and there are beautiful locales, tight action sequences, and a few genuinely funny scenes. But the other 90 minutes is either boring or flat-out bad.The new villians are so bland you'll forget they exist, even as you're watching the movie. The look of the movie has taken an odd 'digital' downgrade. It just looks cheap. I was watching this in 4k and it only exposed the flaws. The story bits are cliché after cliché with no attempt to put a spin or twist on very tired concepts. The scene where the detectives watch the kids play sports is especially egregious, I've seen in at least 25 other movies. Super Troopers did a good parody of it many moons ago.This captures the classic feeling of Bad Boys a few times, but left me unsatisfied.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Will Smith is awesome, a great funny character with a hard drama scene. Kate Del Castillo played an evil woman, she's great too. Paola Núñez is lovely and strong, the same thing with Vanessa Hudgens, two great actresses. The film is funny and full of action, I laughed and I was thrilled with the chases and action scenes. The film is about working together, two good police fellows, also a team of different races: black, white, latino, asian. There is some race stereotypes but not a big deal, Bad Boys for Life is a comedy after all with a good heart for racial inclusion. The film meaning about friendship and team working is amazing.

Except for Will Smith and Joe Pantoliano, the movie is one big miscast with people like Vanessa Hudgens and Charles Melton who are obviously only in this movie for their looks and have nothing else to offer. The action is underwhelming and their is zero chemistry, not even between Smith and Lawrence.The final nail is not even the terrible story and conclusion which forces a lame origin story down your throat, but the whole presence of Martin Lawrence who does nothing more than scream, yell and make the unfunniest jokes you've heard in a while. The Bad Boys are done.","2 out of 13 found this helpful.

Kate del Castillo - an excellent actress, appears only briefly (what a waste of talent) - and yet she still manages to create a detailed presence with the few lines and scenes given her.
Jacob Scipio - (Kate del Castillo characters son in the film) - does an excellent job of portraying the familial loyal son with doubts. Unfortunately, the writers couldn't be bothered portraying him with any kind of real personality, regular speech patterns or wit (shame on them).
I could go on, about how good the actors and actresses are in this film... but I'd far exceed my submission length here... so, I'm going to try and sum in up in a few sentences.
The movie is about the original 'Bad Boys' - but it should NOT have centred itself (almost in its entirety) upon them.
A man/woman who has enough hatred to kill you, is NOT - by definition - a bit part! - They must have a reason, unless you're dealing with a complete sociopath (in which case, there is still a reason!) - and that reason shouldn't appear in the last 2 minutes of any Movie or the last 5 pages of any book!With all of the above in mind - the entire casting effort was excellent - great actors and actresses who were under used in soooo many instances - but still excellent.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

That saves this film from being the worst of all times. Horrible cliche driven wannabe expendables movie. The acting is below par for both Lawrence and Smith. A mail in performance that's more obvious than Martin's off season weight gain. All of those involved in this film should be ashamed off pounding out the drivel they played off as an attempt at the third instalment of Bad Boys. A once incredibly respectable and well written, directed and produced action experience has finally exposed Hollywood's inner soul...garbage. They wanted money from Tik tok loving adhd automatons and sadly, they got a little from this effort. If you can call it that. This movie is worse than Robocop 3 if you can imagine.
Save your time, save your money. Go watch ""Hunt for the wilderpeople"" or maybe an episode of ""Chopped"". Because this movie sure as hell doesn't cut it.","2 out of 13 found this helpful.

Mike & Marcus reunite for one last ride, to take down the bad guys.Bad Boys for Life is an awesome movie. Directors Adil & Bilall, have recaptured the magic that made Bad Boys(1995) & Bad Boys II(2003), huge box office successes. The action set pieces are the highlight of the film. Another strong point, is the effortless camaraderie & banter between Will Smith & Martin Lawrence. All the one-liners are hilarious. I just feel that there are some scenes that are unnecessarily dramatic. The original Bad Boys(1995) is my favorite movie of the franchise. Bad Boys II(2003) just gets a slight edge over this movie. Will Smith is spectacular as Mike. Martin Lawrence is outstanding as Marcus. Vanessa Hudgens is amazing as Kelly. Alexander Ludwig is great as Dorn. Charles Melton is superb as Rafe. Paola Nunez is brilliant as Rita. Kate del Castillo is perfect as Isabel Aretas. Joe Pantoliano is excellent as Captain Howard. Theresa Randle is good as Theresa. Bad Boys for Life is a must watch for fans of the Bad Boys franchise. Can't wait for Bad Boys 4!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Despite being advised against it by his captain Mike goes rogue and decides to investigate his own assassination attempt and sadly can't rely on his old partner who has decided that he is going to retire...First thing that is fairly noticeably absent here is Michael Bay's direction; this third instament is very much less wham bam thank your mam which acts as both a blessing and a curse....Bad Boys For Life takes on a much more serious tone than its predecessors (which I suppose is oddly inevitable), but sadly it simply doesn't work in its entirety...So once the story gets established and everything is in play the film becomes rather monotnous and mundane lacking in both firepower and any kind of pzazz. I like both Lawrence and Smith both individally and in their respective roles here, but they are both underwhelming acting as if they are both contractually obliged as opposed acting as though they genuinely care.The story is quite weak as are the villains and the ludicrous plot twists which all culminate in a semi-involving film, but certainly nothing more than that. I quite liked the change of pace (moreso with Lawrence's character having to accept his age and Mike Lowery still being the more child like of the two) but it sadly never amounted into being a wholely involving picture.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

The VERDICT:How can this movie live up to the legacy before it? Truth is... it really can't, but to go so long and be this put together, I give it applause. Bad Boys For Life is a lot of fun, and full of the rush we fell in love with a long time ago. It brings the past and present together in a manner that should help rope fans in, while never losing sight of the goals and story it set forth. Good use of characters, balancing the comedy with a special effects ridden action set, and tying everything together with that champion acting leads to one of the best reboots I've seen in a while. Yes, it still has some balance issues that have not been perfected, primarily in getting the right time for some action moments, some comedy elements more fine tuning, and most importantly working out their bad guys a little more. Still, this is one for the theaters for me and I encourage most to pay the trip to enjoy it in surround sound. From all this my scores are:Action/Comedy/Crime: 8.5

I saw his Instagram, and he mentioned the movie. You can't deny he has a talent, for making you curious. So I checked the movie out.

The movie have the right balance between drama and humor. In fact to me is the best since the first day ive found the movie because is both a cop vs bad guys, is a supernatural movie(watch it) and a comedy when is time.Mike and marcus are older now, and the movie uses this for better. There is alot of jokes about getting old, and alot of jokes between mike and marcus, and this timemike have a new porsche 911 carrera 4s 2018(a reference to the first movie)
another new thing is that now they have a supporting team of cops, and there is many good scenes with the team and the bad boys.And the ending...between the music, the photography and the style...is one of those great endings that makes the movie even better. Yes, there is violence, jokes and car crashes, but for me the third movie make everything more easy to watch because feels more coherent, even the soundtrack is more fun because is a mix between instrumentals and songs that work just when you want them to listen.In many ways, have the 2000 feel and never become excessive.I have watched alot of times this movie, to the point that i remember every scene. Paola nuñez and vannessa hudgens shine here, and theres many jokes between the drama that make it easy to see it everyday.For fans, listen the whole soundtrack in youtube, theres alot of good instrumentals to listen when u want to.Deserves the best rating

In all honesty it began to run out if steam in the second entry. That being said I'm happy to say that this was actually quite good. It took me a little while to get into it because it's such a different film than the others. It's not as flashy and it's more story and character driven. Theres a fair amount of schmaltz as we encounter Mike and Marcus getting older and focusing on more ""life"" oriented stuff. But before you know it they find themselves the targets of an assassination revenge plot. The movie is self aware and smart and so much humor comes from that it. The action is a bit more subdued and realistic to connect with modern Audiences and it all just finds a right balance. But don't get me wrong it's still gory, edge of your seat and really, really hilarious. The movie also benefits from a strong supporting cast which includes a smoking hot villain and the handsome Alexander Ludwig, hell even Vanessa Hudgens wasn't too bad. This entry really pulls off the rare feat of taking an aged property and making it feel modern while keeping it retro enough to appreciate the nostalgia. Of course the film isn't perfect it can be a bit too hammy in spots and the direction feels a little too amateur in moments. But all in all it's a fun thrill ride with a big heart that deals with some real stuff.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

Why not flip it around? It's not that the USA has no gun problem and isn't half full of morons. Even the color grading and scenery is an offensive stereotype (""Miami looks clean and beautiful / Mexico is full of old and dirty buildings""). In 2020 you gotta try something new!What a waste of time this was.","2 out of 23 found this helpful.

It was *the* 90s action movie - that perfect blend of characters, comedy, and Michael Bay-ishness. I heard such good things about installment 3 that I got kinda excited...maybe this could make me forget part 2? Unfortunately, this movie felt like it was about 25 years late. The characters were just caricatures of themselves (also, Martin Lawerence is somehow a worse actor now?). The villains were as cheesy as the twists. The action was laughable. Plus, the portrayal of policing here felt comically out of step with this moment. I wanted to see the Bad Boys ride one more time, but maybe I just should have watched the first one again. There were some genuine laughs throughout, but not everything needs another sequel.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

I rewatched them both before this and while a bit dated, they'e still all that. This instalment even plays on that a little, with running in-jokes about getting older between Mike and Marcus. They largely fall pretty flat, but they tried.
However, there's no hiding that Martin Lawrence is just bad here. 90% of his lines are delivered in a druggy slur, and his comedic timing is entirely absent. Since he's also clearly not an action star, that makes him a massive liability, and he drags everyone else down around him.
Will Smith can't really carry it and the AMMO team are interesting enough, but the baddie's best moments are spent in their respective first 2 min on-screen, and there's a lot of dead air in-between those scenes and the finale while we talk about non-story, family, filler stuff.
It's okay. Lefty lawyers will hate it - there's a lot of disregard for the law and collateral damage including what must be dozens of civilian fatalities during a chase scene - but it's still mostly dumb fun. It's not nearly as big or especially as fast as it should be, but it's still okay.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

When you watch the title, if you haven't seen a movie, and you're susceptible the mainstream media subliminal tactics, you're most likely to assume, that is a comedy movie.

I think the Bad Boys movies minus Michael Bay are just lacking, and I don't like the approach taken for both this one and Ride or Die. Bad Boys for Life was a little more tolerable than Ride or Die, which I thought started kind of boring and then became aggressively bad by the end.Bad Boys for Life, like that fourth film, makes strange decisions on where to take its aging main characters. There's a tension in trying to keep things breezy, silly, and action-packed while also acknowledging these characters are getting older. It's just not funny enough, and the action just doesn't satisfy like it did in Bad Boys II. To be honest, the action scenes were also a little forgettable in Bad Boys 1, but there was a charm there because it was the first, and because it has that '90s feel to it. It was immature, but in a youthful and sort of fun way.I placed a lot of blame on the directors when it came to tearing into Ride or Die, but now, I don't want to blame them entirely. I think this third film looks and moves okay; better than the overdone fourth film. Maybe I'd become a member of Team Adil & Bilall if they got their hands on a better script and directed it in the future. The writing for Bad Boys for Life and Ride or Die... not good in either instance. The new characters sucked in Ride or Die, and they suck when being introduced here in Bad Boys for Life.I just don't like these newer ones. Bay brought some flair to things, and Martin Lawrence and Will Smith were both funnier and more entertaining in those first two. These last two? I'm indifferent at best, and genuinely irritated at worst.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Martin Lawrence is fat and I felt like he didn't give a damn about this movie. He was like it is what it is folks.

The movie is set in Miami, 17 years after the last film, and follows the story of two Miami detectives, Marcus Burnet and Mike Lowery, played by Will Smith and Martin Lawrence, as they chase down an assassin named Armando. The movie also features a great cast including Vanessa Hudgens, Alexander Ludwig, Paola Núñez, Charles Melton, Kate del Castillo, Nicky Jam, and Joe Pantoliano. The chemistry between the cast is amazing, making it a fun and enjoyable watch.

And yet, here we are with fresh blood trying to fix what seemed broken. A good movie needs not only characters but solid character development - that's what we've learned about movie making.Now, here we have two characters and they haven't really been given a lot of development so far, so what do we do? We give 'em some! And while this drama unfolds in front of your eyes, a great share of nostalgia, a decent portion of ""coming of age""-breeze and a constant reminder of the final ultimate point-of-no-return end of the protagonists' relationship - you quickly start asking when something will blow up? Because, huh, you got me there, I actually came here just to see that in the first place. But instead we're treated with characters who not only play to be, but really appear tired.And, subsequently, we should be treated at least with our fair share of action, right? I mean, even the The Dark Knight Rises paid off in that sense. And the action in Bad Boys for Life is big - on paper. But it's unbelievable unimaginatively captured and put to screen. Yes, the colors are the there (just like Bay), the lights shines nicely on everything we need to see (just like Bay), the dialogues are sometimes stereotypically snotty (just like Bay) but, and what am I saying here, BUT this certain Mr Bay would have made this movie more fluent, more, *trembling here* gracious.Right after I saw BBFL I went home, turned on Netflix, watched Bad Boys II and was blown away by how good this movie looks even by today's standards, 13 years later. Even the CGI is mostly bearable. In BBFL the camera angles, movements and focuses are sometimes just lazy compared to Bay's work in the two previous movies. And then there is the music - once again compared to Bad Boys II, it's generic, sometimes even non-supportive, thin and sits bad in the mix at times. To be honest, the music of Bad Boys II wasn't necessarily original, but it had a drive, it pumped and blasted when it had to. BBFL's music, however, is just a collection of phrases and instrumentations we've heard I-don't-know-how-many-times. Lazy would be a good word to describe it.Bad Boys for Life is the best ""movie"" of the three (if you go by by-the-book rules) but it's the worst Bad Boys film (if you loved the first two ones for what they were - and are).","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
