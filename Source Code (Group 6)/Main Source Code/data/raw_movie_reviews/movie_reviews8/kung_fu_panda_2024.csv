They would notice the diminishing charm, the losing essence, and the fading magic of the storytelling that was once prominent but now are gone.The franchise has regrettably become a cash-cow, which serves nothing but one lone purpose: to mint money for the studio and their executives. I think they should stop now!","77 out of 84 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Not awful, but certainly not good","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9664362/?ref_=tt_urv","emwilliams-02657","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur154787957/?ref_=tt_urv","8 March 2024","I think the title of my review says it all. If I had to come up with a word to describe the film, it would merely be, ""passable."" I chuckled a couple of times and my kids (6 & 7) loved it. At the end of the day, I suppose that's money well spent. That being said, I am a huge fan of many DreamWorks franchises, including the first 3 KFP films, with the 3rd installment being the weakest of them, but still a good time. Compared to KP4, which didn't really add anything to the franchise, the 3rd film is a masterpiece. I found the pacing and the humor of KP4 all over the map. It felt like the film was rushing the audience along without time to really feel any of the emotions it wanted us to feel. It felt like a Saturday morning cartoon rather than a memorable addition to the KFP film canon.So, in the end, I'm glad my kids loved it because I am promptly going to forget everything about this movie. When I think of KFP, scenes like Po finding inner peace in the ruins of his village in KFP 2 will always readily come to mind. I will continue to laugh at the jokes in the first 3 films, but even now I'm struggling to recall the best jokes of KFP4 and I just saw it not even an hour ago. The best, most enduring part of this movie is callback to villains of the previous films. Otherwise, it was one big colorful, fast-paced ""Meh.""The kids will enjoy it though.","112 out of 133 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Kung Fu Panda 4 offers a fun, above-average animated experience but stands as the weakest link in the series","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9670025/?ref_=tt_urv","kevin_robbins","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur131783850/?ref_=tt_urv","10 March 2024","My wife and I caught Kung Fu Panda 4 (2024) in theaters last night. The storyline introduces a new villain, a chameleon with shape-shifting abilities, aiming to take over the world. The chameleon seeks to use the staff Po received in Kung Fu Panda 3 to open a gateway to another dimension, summon kung fu masters, and steal their powers to become unstoppable. Simultaneously, Po must find his replacement to train as the next Dragon Warrior. Can Po save the world and find his apprentice simultaneously?Co-directed by Mike Mitchell (Trolls) and Stephanie Stine (Major Motion Picture debut), the film features the voices of Jack Black (School of Rock), Viola Davis (The Help), Awkwafina (Crazy, Rich, Asians), Dustin Hoffman (Tootsie), James Hong (Big Trouble in Little China), Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad), and Ke Huy Quan (Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom).The animation, animal universe, and the introduction of the new villain were excellent, as always. Viola Davis was a great addition, but Awkwafina's presence felt awkward and annoying. The absence of the Furious Five was noticeable, and the two-father subplot was just okay. The film strikes a good balance between lessons and comedy, and kept us laughing throughout. While the ending was rewarding, it didn't quite match the brilliance of previous films in the series.In conclusion, Kung Fu Panda 4 offers a fun, above-average animated experience but stands as the weakest link in the series. I'd score it a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once.","45 out of 58 found this helpful.

It wasnt *terrible,* but it was just really lame and a major step down from all the previous KFP movies. Yes, even the third one. Not as much of a step down as megamind 2 mind you, but its definitely there. Firstly they ditched a lot of the voice actors from the original series, and so what they did was they either shoehorned them out of the story with some lame excuse, or just not gave them lines and just had them appear silent. The emotional depth is there, but again, its just a step down from what we've grown to expect from kung fu panda. The movie has a lot of filler and pointless subplots, po is reduced to a whiny baby in the first 10 minutes of the movie, the pacing is off, and the villain, OH MAN the villain was weak. Again, not the worst thing in the world, but her motives were purely contradictory from things that were established in the movies universe, shes never portrayed as a real threat. (remember back in KFP 2 when it was stated that lord shen literally killed a king fu master early on? The worst thing the chameleon does in this movie is push a guy down a flight of stairs. Oh no.)
the action was there i guess, it had some creative and somewhat exciting action scenes, the animation was pretty good overall, especially with the chameleons morphs (Probably just because there isnt an ""animators strike"" going on as well)
its definitely kung fu panda, but it just feels like they forgot a couple ingredients for the stew, so to speak. It just ended up being a step down from what we were expecting. Not terrible, just disappointing.","51 out of 67 found this helpful.

Comedy is getting worse and worse; even if I prefer the humor of the first two movies, the third managed to get some laughs out of me, this one didn't. I wish the directors understood that what made the first two films successful was how deep the story was and how well the characters were developed, something that was lost in this one. Yes, it's a movie for kids, but the previous ones were also and they still managed to touch on dark themes and be enjoyable for adults; I'm currently 22 years old and I never got tired of watching Kung Fu Panda 2, laughing, crying and getting emotional like when I was 11.

And I did like the different kind of energy Awkwafina brought to the rest of the cast.

A predictable story that has charm and heart as it shows you're never done learning.Jack Black just isn't capable of phoning it in at this point, once again bringing 100% and imbuing Po with the same energy and endearing quality that he had from the beginning. Awkwafina is the ideal counterpart for this double act and their chemistry almost makes up for the lack of the furious five.Viola Davis brings a commanding presence and some solid humour to the chameleon which is needed more than ever considering how weak the villain's motivation is. Bryan Cranston and James Hong remain a wonderful double act and Ian McShane deserved something more substantial for Tai Lung's long awaited return.Director Mike Mitchell and co-director Stephanie Ma Stine ensure the action has the speed and satisfying choreography whilst taking time for some stylish flourishes. The animation is as vibrant and detailed as usual, keeping the same style as before opposed to a post Spider-verse reinvention.The score by Hans Zimmer and Steve Mazzaro disappointingly goes unnoticed for the most part, which kinda felt like a given. Anytime it does stand out it's only because it's using some of the pieces from the previous films which are always a joy to hear and still evoke so many emotions.","15 out of 27 found this helpful.

It's certainly not bad, as some people say, but it's not necessarily ""good"" either. So, Po has to give up his title as the Dragon Warrior and become, what, ""The Mental Consultant of The Valley of Peace""? But, he just doesn't want to be promoted and wants to keep being the Dragon Warrior. Then a bunch of goats just come in and say that Tai is back. So long story short, Po teams up with a fox named Zhen, who says that a villain named Chameleon is going to (guess) take over the Valley of Peace. This is where many spoilers come in, so I won't say the rest. So, overview:
Story: 7/10: Decently intriguing story, fine by me
Animation: 9/10: Polished, like the last few. Nothing to say here.Characters: 6/10: I feel like some of the characters were, well, unused, especially Chameleon. The movie just wastes her and some other characters.Kids will enjoy it, and I maybe laughed a few times but only 3 or 4 times. Maybe the problem here is they were working on a lower budget ($85 million) compared to the previous films in the $100 million - $150 million range.Overall, I'd give it 7/10. Fairly decent but not much to enjoy here.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

-DreamWorks has created another fantastic world filled with stunning design and animation.-Fluid movement combined with great animation makes a fantastic place to enjoy the adventure, loaded to the nines with that same splendor found in Kung Fu Panda.-The animals hold so much personality, which when mixed with the gorgeous setting, creates a vivid world that is pleasing to the eyes, especially in 3-D.Strong Voice Acting
-A fabulous cast comes together to bring the animals to life in ways that create engaging characters.-Jack Black is the martial arts mammal and is still as ridiculous as ever with his clumsy, goofy, and naïve self that continues to melt our hearts. Somehow, he still gives some heart to his performance to bring out the deeper levels of Po's character development.-Awkwafina is a newcomer to the game and brings that sass and attitude to the fox character, Zhen. A great personification of the actress, she's a welcome addition to the world, with her humor fitting well into the animal antics.-And Davis rounds out the acting with a solid performance. The chameleon has a poignant prose, and her status is well-matched to Davis' strong demeanor, deep, icy voice, and threatening attitude that the actress carries well.Funny At Many Parts
-If you are a fan of Kung Fu Panda humor, chances are you will find enjoyment in the fourth installment.-Po's adventure is loaded with quirky dialog that is innocent and jovial. His naivety is charming to watch, but I like how Po engages with the cavalcade of characters who spice up the antics.-His dads come along for the ride as well, forming a fun substory that held its charm and cuteness. The little intermissions from the story helped keep the humor fresh and blended nicely to the ending without going too far out of the way to accomplish it.-Altogether, the movie accomplished much in this department and stuck to its roots for simplistic chuckles and laughs.Deep Story Components
-Despite being a kid's film, Kung Fu Panda 4 still manages to give some deeper plot elements that were very relevant to me.-Po's journey keeps evolving with each film, requiring the clumsy oaf to face the changes life throws at him and take the lessons to heart.-It did not matter with whom he engaged. Po somehow manages to find those vulnerabilities and engage them in a manner that feels legitimate and authentic.-This helps reign in the movie from becoming too comedic and helps viewers invest a bit more into the film and complete this journey with the panda.Entertaining End Credits
-The first half of the credits gives you more animated goodness with our characters and brings some nostalgia that I quite enjoyed.-A cover by the lead actor's band accompanies the scenes and provides a solid track that matches the theme of the sequence.-Surprisingly, the song is also quite a good cover with comedy and rock beautifully combining into an engaging and energetic track.Cute And Balanced
-The movie accomplishes much in being an entertaining film for all ages to enjoy.-One level is the heavy emphasis on silly antics, laughable clumsiness, and the censorship that cushions the violet components of the movie.-Yet, Kung Fu Panda 4 is not pulling punches either. The movie provides plenty of inside jokes and elements for parents and older members to enjoy that helps expand who will enjoy the movie.-Such a balance is what I loved in nineties movies and this film felt in touch with that balance.Action That Works Super Well
-Surprisingly, I really loved the action of this film and found it to be one of the better sequences I've seen in a while.-The animation is a solid display of computer-generated imagery, with strong attention to detail to display the martial arts in an accurate manner.-Dynamic fight sequences unleash the tension of the moment and hold anime level quality of fast punches, wicked reversals, and physics defying finishers. All with that magical twist representative of the lore.DISLIKES:More Of The Same
-It's a great movie, but the fourth installment still is more of the same design and function as the others.-While the base is important, I would have enjoyed the movie adding that twist and edge that the first two movies held.-Or at least reintegrate the other characters a little better to help give a bit more climactic suspense into the movie and elevate the movie's inclusion of many new characters.A Rushed Finale
-Another instance of timing issues, this film still struggled to perfect the final battle and finish.-Po's part they knocked out of the park, which was the saving grace of the movie. While the planning, character speeches and last-minute solutions were the weaker elements that needed another ten to fifteen minutes to make it worthwhile.-Even the touching speech at the end felt a tad drowned out by the quick wrap up, only saved by the transition to the fun credits and the promise something more could still come from this film.Predictable
-No surprises here. King Fu Panda Four doesn't add too many twists or surprises that I could not predict early on in the film.-There isn't much more I can say. So don't expect any mind-blowing moments, but in a way it doesn't matter.Tries A Tad Hard To Be Funny
-And like always, Jack Black and the crew sometimes try a bit too hard to get a rise out of you.-Some lines are a tad over-emphasized, a little too much push to get the line out and get you to laugh.-Other running jokes become stale or annoying, never knowing when to quit. I suspect such antics will be enjoyed by kids, but viewers like me might just roll their eyes at the constant reiteration.The VERIDCT:
Kung Fu Panda's latest installment may not be the most unique experience I have had, but it certainly is one of the more fun movies I've gotten this year. Sticking to its roots, Po's story continues to be a fun adventure filled with family-friendly laughs and balanced storytelling for all ages to enjoy. Beautiful design and animation make the world come to life and strong voice acting helps to further develop the characters we've grown to love. And with action that is very fitting and perhaps some of the better fights I've seen in a long time, the movie accomplishes much in a shorter run time. Sure, a few twists could have broken up the monotony alongside better character usage. A less rushed ending also would have helped this movie end on the strongest foot it could with that wisdom meets humor, but the entertaining credits are a blessing. With everything incorporated, I give this movie:Animation/Action/Adventure: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.5.","48 out of 87 found this helpful.

Its a fun watch overall. Welcoming back Jack Black as Po is fantastic, he's still measuring up the character as fantastic as when I first saw him in the original, and his cover of that Britney Spears song he does as Tenacious D was exactly what I wanted
The addition of Awkiafina was perfect. What!? Is she just doing voice-overs now? Viola Davis voicing the new Big Bad, Chameleon was the nail in the coffin for me. Having Ian McShane come back as a Ti po only proved that Chameleon was the best villain in the series yet and the plot serves as Fan service to those who love the franchise made this whole experience worth it
I was nervous about the film because from the trailer I knew that this was out with the old and in with the new. Jack Black has become a bankable star since the first flick. Is it possible that his paycheck was so big that they could not afford to get Angelia Jolie and Jackie Chan in a voice booth for a few hours to come up with just a handful of sentences? They were missed greatly.However, despite my disappointment of not seeing the old characters in this new movie the new movie does not suffer too much for it. I feel the thunder once more.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

If you want to introduce a successor then you have to nerf the MC or other villians. The makers had an opportunity to utilize all the previous villains but they missed it. They could have atleast give Po a good shining moment and they kind of missed it too. They could have made the main villain more influential like Tai lung or Shen.Po is quite young to pass the torch and atleast they he should have a big moment before he could agree on doing it. They took about 9 years to make this movie and still felt rushed.I THINK THE BIGGEST ISSUE WITH MOVIE WAS ITS LENGHT. They could have give more screen time to all the important characters.","34 out of 45 found this helpful.

I also watched the fourth film. To be honest, I believe this is the weakest movie in the series. Yes, they reduced their budget, but the animation quality is outstanding. Jack Black is a wonderful person, and his performance in this film was equally impressive. The Super 5 kung fu masters do not appear (as a cameo) in the film, so there is no voice acting. The Chameleon character is not bad, but she is weak compared to other villains. I didn't like her motivation very much either. I would like to see more Tai Lung scenes. Zhen was not a bad character, but it was voiced by Awkwafina. That is why I was annoyed by this character. Also, I didn't like the dragon warrior chosen in the finale at all, and it wasn't the right choice. There will be two more new movies. I hope they make better decisions on those two movies.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

After I watched this movie, I can tell you that this movie was fairly good. Yes, it was not. The best part of the Kung Fu Panda movie series, but it was entertaining. If you decide to watch the movie for the purpose of a deep story and compelling events, you will rate the movie 4/10 and you will not like it at all.

As for the shortcomings of this film, as I said previously, its story is very simple and has many similarities with previous parts, in addition to the fact that the escalation of events is very fast and that the villain of this film has weak motives and some jokes and events are repeated from previous parts. I cannot really say that this movie is the best part of Kung Fu Panda, and I also cannot say that it is a disaster. Rather, it is an average and enjoyable movie, and I hope that this movie will be the Series finale.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Yes? No? Just me? Alright I'll shut up. Po must train a new warrior when he's chosen to become the spiritual leader of the Valley of Peace. However, when a powerful shape-shifting sorceress sets her eyes on his Staff of Wisdom, he suddenly realizes he's going to need some help. Teaming up with a quick-witted corsac fox, Po soon discovers that heroes can be found in the most unexpected places.To start off, the movie was slightly underwhelming with all the high expectations I had especially with how much I like and appreciate the first 3 films (particularly the first one). What makes the Kung Fu Panda movies, and the big DreamWorks movies in general, is the emotional aspect. You really feel a very solid connection with the characters in the movie and root for the protagonist from the bottom of you heart. In this film, this was not present. It felt like it was a bit too rushed with a bunch of forced comedy which wasn't always that funny. The story was a bit cliché but the idea of the antagonist was pretty smart. However, there was so much lost potential with this character that I felt would really have elevated the movie. Just like ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" where the villian was one of the best animated villain I've seen. Now the movie definitely serves its purpose as a childrens' animated film and that can be realised by the 417 million dollars it raised in just about a month.So if you have kids or you are one, then definitely check it. However, if you're a big fan of the franchise and prefer not to ruin that for yourself, then it's better if you avoid it.Score:6.5/10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The villain is so completely underdeveloped, with no real backstory, no coherent motive- the writers couldn't even bother to give her a name. Most importantly however, nothing of importance happens in this movie. There is zero growth or change, and the characters you have come to love in this franchise don't even make any important impact on the plot. The writers should be embarrassed, because this was some lazy, cash-grab garbage.

Removing these elements would diminish the movie's appeal, leaving it rather ordinary. The absence of charm and personality in the characters is noticeable, raising questions about the decision to strip away the very elements that contribute to the story's greatness.It's evident that the writers may not have shared the enthusiasm for Kung Fu Panda, and witnessing the once vibrant world of the film diminish in the hands of new creators is disheartening. The exclusion of the fearsome five proves to be a regrettable choice, and the absence of Oogway further compounds the disappointment. Unlike the menacing Tai Lung, Lord Shen, and Kai, the Chameleon lacks the same intimidation and evil presence, resulting in a notable loss of heart.

I was laughing quite a lot and I still felt like there was a a certain charm with characters like Po and his Dad's. But as the movie progressed, particularly after the first half I began to question the direction the director chose to take. This was certainly due in part to Awkwfina's character who is bland, generic and uninteresting and takes up so much of the movie.

The Kung Fu Panda series has entertained me since childhood. I watch these films in a soft-minded way, like a child. But this time this film paled in comparison to other films. The action, comedy, humor and emotion in this movie were very weak compared to other movies. It doesn't have the same level of impact that was there in the first movie. Dumping old characters to establish new characters was a bad decision. Whereas this used to be a major part of action and comedy in the movie. I think the makers forgot the difference between the web series and movies of Kung Fu Panda. If a sequel is made then it should be made like the old movie and not like this movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Movie Review -Our dragon warrior Po is back, but without the furious five. But don't let that worry you, because he's got another companion this time. As nature's rule goes, you must have thought about Po passing his dragon warrior suit to someone someday, right? He took it from someone, so he must find a successor. Kung Fu Panda 4 is about Po retiring from his duties as a dragon warrior and taking on a bigger job. Despite this sentimental thought, the writing never becomes emotionally forceful or suppressive. It's a fun flick, just like the previous three films of the franchise, and that's the best part about it. You follow nature's laws and make it look acceptable-something that Toy Story 3 did way back in 2010. KFP 4 manages to score well on merits with its reliable writing and immensely enjoyable screenplay that follows all the traditional methods of the Kung Fu Panda franchise and yet cooks a delicious dish from different ingredients.Po, the Dragon Warrior, is enjoying his adventurous duties just before Master Shifu comes and makes him acquainted with several facts that he must face-sooner or later. Master Shifu commands Po to find a new dragon warrior, a successor, so that Po can take over the bigger duties of the spiritual master of the Valley of Peace. There is a new villain, the Chameleon, a powerful sorceress who can shape-shift into any animal she wants and wants to capture every city and realm. Po, along with his new companion, Zeon, heads to Juniper City to take down the Chameleon. Will Po be able to stop the chameleon, or will he fail to make the right decisions?Written by Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger, and Darren Lemke, Kung Fu Panda 4 may not be a great story, but it's not boring or bad at all. Yes, it looks repetitive since animation films in this zone have to have positive endings and mainstream emotional drama. However, it's not dragging. The screenplay is engaging, and there is a lot of comedy for kids, youth, and adults. From ""No secret ingredient"" to ""Change is a must"" or ""It's never too late to do the right thing,"" we have come a long way with this franchise, and the fourth one just proudly salutes that spirit. Entertaining, hilarious at times, thoroughly humorous, and action-packed-that's what Kung Fu Panda 4's screenplay is all about. It may go wrong with a stretched ending where we know that the villain is going to be defeated, and it takes a little longer than expected to come to that mandatory point, but thankfully, it does not fall flat.The voice cast has done well again. Since there was nothing bad to do, let's say, they have been nice and perfect. Jack Black is your favourite Po, Awkwafina is your new, soon-to-be favourite, Viola Davis is the deadly Chameleon, Dustin Hoffman is our master Shifu, and then you have Po's fathers, James Hong and Byran Cranston, with plenty of funny punches. Ian McShane is Tai, a small but important role. The entire town's gang shouting ""violence violence"" has been ""bloody"" hilarious!The quality of the animation work by DreamWorks Animation was never questioned before and won't ever be. The studio has done amazing work with the production design, visual effects, and 3D development of this blockbuster franchise. I can never forget little Po's cute panda face from the first film and how cute he has looked while growing up until now. In Kung Fu Panda 4, we miss Po's gang, but the underground gang can be called a new discovery here. How they react to wise words and chant violence without being sarcastic made my brain and heart both laugh together. The background score was okay, and the editing is pretty decent. The last 10 minutes could have been trimmed better than this. Mike Mitchell's new tower of Kung Fu Panda is made from the bricks of previous Kung Fu Panda flicks, so it's not completely different and new, but like nostalgia merging with the energy of a new generation. Overall, a healthy and heavy Panda flick that must be enjoyed if you don't want to disturb your ""inner peace."" Now, don't say ""dinner, please,"" or I'll start craving.RATING - 6/10*","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

With ""Po"" being told by ""Master Shifu"" that it is now time for him to move onwards and upwards - much to his chagrin - he must recruit a new dragon warrior so he can retreat to more cerebral pastimes. Luckily, though, the ""Chameleon"" has designs on obtaining all the powers from those now consigned to the nether realm and using the powers of Kung Fu to take over the world. ""Po"" has to be put his promotion on hold and along with his new-found, and useful, foxy friend ""Zhen"" try to thwart these heinous ambitions. Though there's plenty of action and self-deprecating dialogue the storyline really is too much of a recycled affair. Even the panda has been drawn into the multi-verse and to be frank, I'm a bit bored with that theme now - especially as it's never really accompanied by much in the way of jeopardy. Yes, this is an entirely predicable story that, in this case, misses out on the characterisations of his pals from the ""Furious Five"". It's watchable and the story well paced; there's some fun to be had in the wobbly, mountain-top, tavern but I think I've already forgotten most of it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Maybe predictable but nonetheless amusing. Come to think of it, good portion of the scenes were full of detail, kudos to the animators.Final verdict - without much expectation, see it for the good energy it delivers.Oh and they should definitely either stop with this one OR bring back the Five and someone with the likes of Tai Lung (instead of just using his spirit form over and over). I'd stop with this one and call it a winning streak.P. S. - and an important one! Awkwafina's voice is the WORST choise for Zhen, crudely miscast....maybe for a side character yes but total dismatch with the small and tender fox.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

-Hit Me Baby One More Time 🔥🔥🔥Now onto the negatives...
I think Viola Davis's Chameleon is a cool and intimidating villain, however compared to the last three villains, she was a bit lackluster in terms of originality.Not to say she was bad or anything, but I think her motives were kind of weak and could've used more character development and screen time.The pacing I think also was a little too fast for my taste,
which especially the emotional moments kind of fell short and could've used more depth.Hans Zimmer,
although was still great in the music, he felt pushed aside with the pop/rock songs that are irrelevant and doesn't quite meet the level of KFP 1-3s musicAnd if you were hoping that the Furious Five would star a role in this movie, DO NOT THINK SO, keep your expectations low!But I can definitely see why the budget for this movie is tremendously low compared to the last installments is because they cut so many actors such as Angelina Jolie, Seth Rogen, David Cross, Lucy Liu and Jackie Chan.P.

Gary Oldman and JK Simmons do not have any lines for Lord Shen and General Kai.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I don't get why Po has to become the spiritual leader and find a successor to become the next Dragon Warrior. Umm, he is not even that old. He can spend his younger days as the Dragon Warrior fighting enemies of peace. It's like Peter Parker immediately retiring after getting his powers to find a successor and becomes his mentor. It makes no sense. Why should Po become a spiritual leader in his youth? They show a bunch of new villains that Po defeated or sent to the Spirit Realm. So where are their movies? Anyway, this film expands the Kung Fu world with the addition of Juniper City and its inhabitants unaware of The Dragon Warrior or any of Po's adventures in the trilogy. Got some Zootopia/The Bad Guys vibes. If Oogway's stick can steal kung fu from previous villains, why not do that temporarily to defeat a new villain and give the stolen kung fu back to the Spirit Realm lol. The Chameleon is a really good villain. The absence of The Furious Five did not bother me. Zhen is a nice character but why choose her as the next Dragon Warrior lol.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The story didn't stand out much, and the characters didn't develop much either. The main villain seemed strong, but her motivations and how she got defeated were kinda silly. And the Dragon Warrior made some really strange choices. What bothered me most was how the movie treated past villains like they were just animals, they were lifeless and their animation was different from before. The action scenes were good, but somehow they didn't feel as awesome as the ones in the first three movies.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Of course you can count on Jack Black's charismatic charm to not let you down, but that's mostly all it has going for it. Well, that and some really good animation, but that is to be expected. It also has Awkwafina being Awkwafina (unsurprisingly), and comedy that's at least smile-worthy, but its lack of a strong, compelling story unlike all its predecessors make it the weakest installment thus far. It also doesn't help that the villain here is insanely over-powered on paper, but is presented horribly, making her the weakest of the 4 Kung Fu Panda villains, and worse, the most boring.For all its shortcomings however, it's still an eye-catching, high energy, swell time at the cinema. The best thing we can all hope for right now is that the series ends with this movie, because everything the Kung Fu Panda franchise could offer, it has to exhaustion, and they might as well end it on what is still a relatively high note.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This kind of thing usually means lazy uninspired cash grab. Many reviewers think this movie is just that. For me, I actually enjoyed it. I've enjoyed every Kung Fu Panda movie, with the third movie being my favorite. I don't love these movies, but they're quite entertaining, and visually pleasing. The stories for these films are pretty straightforward and predictable. The villains are often fairly one-note, with a smidge of depth to them. However, the films make up for these things with fun characters, amazing action, and gorgeous visuals from the backgrounds to the character designs, especially regarding the villains. The movies also have good themes and messages that are poignant not just for kids but everyone.Kung Fu Panda 4 delivers all of those things for me. I was admittedly hesitant about the film given its lukewarm reception and knowing that the Fearsome Five are barely in the film until the very end. That was a red flag, as was Awkwafina's character, Zhen. It was strange at first not having the Fearsome Five not there. Given Po's new personal dilemma in the film it did feel even stranger that they weren't included. However, as the movie progressed, I stopped caring that they weren't there, as the new side characters did a good job at picking up the slack. Po's father figures were also quite funny to watch.Was this film needed? Not really. Part 3 wrapped up the story nicely. However, as far as unneeded sequels go, you can do a lot worse than this movie. I think the film does make a valiant case for its existence and it being the final film instead of part 3. The theme of the film is that nothing can stay the same forever, and that's okay. Po needs to let go of his current status so he can move to another stage in life and pass the torch on. Though, admittedly, it is a bit forced given that Po is still in the prime of his life. You also have Po going up against a villain who has all the powers of everyone he's fought previously. All those things make for a decent finale, assuming this is the final one. We'll see about that. This is Hollywood we're talking about.I thought I would hate Zhen's character, especially after her introduction. With how a lot of movies have operated these past several years, I was expecting that she would be the real protagonist, while Po is rendered a second ringer, and make him look like a fool who hasn't learned anything from the past three movies. There were a few moments where it seemed to be going that way. However, they don't do that. While Zhen has a very important role, and has a significant arc, it's still primarily Po's story, and they respect the character.The visuals are still amazing, and definitely worth seeing on the big screen. The fights are still on point as well. The villain is cool. The villain in part 3 is still my favorite, but The Chameleon was quite entertaining. I actually thought the humor was some of the best in these movies. The humor in the Kung Fu Panda movies have always been hot or miss for me, but here it was more hit than miss.Overall, I think it's a solid addition to the franchise. Youn kids will certainly have a good time with it. I think it's worth seeing on the big screen, particularly if you have kids.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

For the first time in almost a decade, comedy icon Jack Black returns to his role as Po, the world's acknowledged most unlikely kung fu master. Some familiar characters are here to support him on his journey along with some new relationships which refresh this beloved franchise.Po, the Dragon Warrior (Jack Black) is about to experience a transition in his kung fu role in the Valley of Peace. Kung Fu Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) informs Po that he is needed to become a spiritual leader and to choose and train the next Dragon Warrior. This new role is a challenge for Po as he enjoys butt-kicking moves to counter villains and questions his fitness for a new cerebral role. While searching for inner peace we are reminded that for Po everything comes back to dumplings. Resisting his new role, Po determines it is necessary to first thwart a powerful new sorceress, Chameleon (Viola Davis), who can shapeshift and seeks total kung fu domination. He finds an unlikely partner in a tricky thief, Zhen (Awkwafina) who ends up teaching him that heroes can be found even in a den of thieves.The computer animation of this film is so beautiful that, in the beginning, it almost appears to be 3D. The backgrounds are stunning and you'll love the various scenes in this wonton wonderland from DreamWorks Animation. I really enjoyed the interaction between the unlikely duo of Po and Zhen and the comedy created between their two characters. I absolutely love the new villain Chameleon and Viola Davis really illustrates how small and stylish stature doesn't impact the extent of evil evident in a character.This film's message is that true change comes from within and that support from family and friends makes a great impact while helping to enable that change. After all, every step someone takes, no matter how large or small creates a footprint for others to follow.Kung Fu Panda 4 gets 5 out of 5 stars from me and I recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. This movie releases in theaters March 8, 2024 so go enjoy this hilarious new chapter in a favorite action-comedy franchise!

I personally have enjoyed every film up to this point. But as the films progress there's always the possibility they will eventually begin to lack in quality as we've seen in previous animated franchises (I'm looking at you Ice Age). While I do feel this way with this new film it's still a good film worth watching. After an 8 year stint, the franchise may have lost some of its steam but still has enough to keep me interested. This film isn't anywhere near as emotional, and heartfelt as the other films, with those depths definitely playing a major factor in what made the others so special. I do not consider this a spoiler since the filmmakers themselves have confirmed that the Furious Five (Tigress, Viper, Mantis, Monkey, and Crane) are not in this pretty much at all. And there absence is very much felt throughout especially when it gets to the final battle. However I do also appreciate the maturity, and overall bravery of the franchise to be able to move on from these beloved characters, it's just would have been better if what they replaced them with had the same amount of potential as they did. What we ended up getting with Awkwafina as Zhen the Fox is not that. She is an appealing character but is she a promising alternative to the Furious Five? No, By a mile she is not. So I can't fall in love with this new character if all I'm thinking about is 'where are the Furious Five?"" I can't help that I've just grown to love those characters, and now I'm having to accept something far less impactful. Viola Davis as the Chameleon works well voice wise but just felt like a lesser version of Lord Shen. Her shape-shifting ability is interesting but despite that she is defeated way too easily. She's certainly not the most memorable villain in the Kung Fu Panda franchise. I'd even say she's the weakest of the four. On the positive side, Jack Black always makes me smile, and at this point owns the role of Po. It is a perfect marriage of character and actor. He is clearly having a great time in this film which makes me all the more happy to be in the company of Po. Dustin Hoffman making his return as Master Shifu is always a warm welcome, and has not lost any of his touch playing the character. I love that even though we are in the fourth film Shifu still struggles with patience and inner peace which makes him a three dimensional character to me. Ian McShane returning as Tai Lung was a major reason I went to see this, and even though he didn't have much screen time, he still leaves a big impact on the story. McShane plays him with such grace, and ferocity its quite remarkable to hear. The backgrounds of this film are amazingly done, water looks realer than ever, and the color pallet is widely varied. From the bright pinks and green of the peach tree to the dark grays and blacks of the night. Beautifully done, and a joy to look at. The music by Hans Zimmer and Steve Mazzaro is very nostalgic to me as they reuse some of the previous themes from the past films. Zimmer collaborating with Jack Black to recreate a Britney Spears song is absolute genius. So in the end this film was definitely not a waste of my time, but I would be lying if I didn't say I did end up leaving the theater unfulfilled. I look forward to what this franchise does next. Skadoosh!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

So, I was happy to see the fourth film in theaters, especially after missing the second and third films. While Kung Fu Panda 4 isn't quite as good as the first or second films, it is better than the third, so there's that.Probably the biggest problem with the film is the plot. It's not a bad plot; far from it. It's just a little predictable. Part of that can be blamed on the trailers, which almost spoiled the whole thing. But even the stuff that wasn't shown you can at least guess for the most part. When you meet the character of Zhen for example, given the circumstances and what Po is going through, you can predict pretty easily where they'll end up at the end. With that said, there is a really good twist involving Zhen that I genuinely didn't see coming. There's also a solid message about accepting change thrown in.The cast and characters are great. Jack Black is fun as always, and hearing him sing Brittney Spears at the end got a good laugh. The Furious Five were missed, but their absence didn't hurt the film. Dustin Hoffman is definitely sounding his age, but he still gives an energetic performance. Po's two dads work well together and get some solid laughs. Zhen is likeable and it's good to see, or rather hear, Awkwafina give a performance that doesn't feel forced. And the Chameleon is a menacing villain with a good motivation, though her scheme is a bit too similar to that of the villain from the third movie.The animation is great as always and doesn't have the obnoxious editing of the third movie. The action scenes are well choreographed and a ton of fun, especially the one that takes place in the tavern. And most of the jokes get good laughs; most of them. There were some that had me rolling my eyes, like the goat fighter that of course does that stupid scream. Thankfully, the jokes that work outweigh the ones that don't, like the bunny kids who are vicious little psychos; they got the biggest laughs.Overall, Kung Fu Panda 4 is a worthy addition to the series and I would recommend it for fans of the films. If you aren't a fan, however, it probably won't change your mind.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

You can tell production had plans to meet everyone's expectation. You can tell they really wanted their big End Game moment, with Poe finally resolving his issues with his past enemies, as well as with the other upcoming changes addressed in the film. They did the best with what they got, and I really appreciate the crew for giving their best efforts! They clearly weren't given the budget to pull off such a cool concept. You have to have more than 85 Million to bring in big names like Jack Black, Awkwafina, Viola Davis, Bryan Cranston, as well as Gary Oldman and JK Simmons. It's not like the limitations they faced weren't obvious.This film was most likely affected by the strike. It was either rushed or delayed by the company, as you can tell by some of the recycled animation concepts. If it wasn't the strike, it was definitely The Wild Robot. You can tell what production Dreamwork's really cared about and it wasn't Kung Fu Panda 4, that Chicken Run sequel, or Megamind 2. Even though the project was rushed, the story is entertaining. I have a habit of guessing the plot of films, and guessed the plot of this film two minutes in. Still, the show tackles concepts both adults and children can relate to. Honestly, the animation of this film is so beautiful. If you didn't feel completely immersed by those gorgeous landscape shots, you went into this film already expecting it to fail.Unfortunately, Dreamwork's is slowly losing itself by following in the same pitfalls as Disney. This is basically their Strange World. It had little marketing, and I'm sure was just meant to bring in some spring break money. It's great to have groundbreaking concepts like The Wild Robot come to life, but that doesn't mean your other films should suffer. Why put all your budget into one major blockbuster when you could even the playing field and have 2-3 big hits?","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

""Kung Fu Panda 4"" isn't one of the great animated films. It's a cash cow, a franchise milking the panda's popularity for all it's worth. The sequels keep rolling out, each one less inspired than the last.Years later, this movie struggles to justify its existence.

Meanwhile, Po remains as charming and strong as always, displaying development that fans of the series will definitely enjoy.The dynamic between Po and a new character, a grey fox - Zhen, that mirrors him in some ways, was another highlight, providing both humor and depth to their interactions.Character development shines brightly in this installment, especially in the evolving relationships between Po, his adoptive goose father, and his biological panda dad. These moments are handled with care, adding emotional weight to the story.The NegativeWhile the film is packed with funny scenes that had me laughing out loud, the editing sometimes felt a bit rushed, leaving me wishing for a few more moments to breathe and fully appreciate the visuals. Similarly, the cinematography occasionally seemed scattered, making it challenging to grasp the full picture of the action unfolding on screen. Hence, the rapid pace of editing and the chaotic cinematography were the main detractors from an otherwise enjoyable film experience.ConclusionDespite its few flaws, Kung Fu Panda 4 delivers an epic story of adventure, humor, and heart. The film's endearing characters, music, and humorous moments make it a worthy continuation of the beloved franchise. The laughter, the thrills, and the touching character arcs create a cinematic experience that's both entertaining and emotionally resonant. My final rating is a solid 7/10.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A Worthy Sequel to a Beloved Trilogy!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9670021/?ref_=tt_urv","KFstudios2009","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur156175536/?ref_=tt_urv","10 March 2024","First of all you need to know that ""The Dragon Knight"" Netflix show isn't connected to the sequel. So most importantly just watch the film trilogy. It's really damn good, and just the creation of a clumsy but at the same time badass kung-fu panda was just fantastic. So jumping to the film, I have to start of saying I was very skeptical. Based on the low reviews, and negative thoughts from the fans, I had my doubts. But no. This movie was just great. Fantastic. I can say it was the least good from the four movie franchise, but I don't say it was bad. Just my least favorite. Still, the returning of the Dragon Warrior (aka Po) couldn't have been better. He is a local hero in his valley, and ready for new adventures. When he spontaneously meets a fox thief called Zhen, he finds out about a new villain that is about to make some chaos, known as The Chameleon. So, as most heroes would do, he settles out for a new adventure, trusting his fate in the fox friend. So that's when the big action starts. From that moment, it was a growing excitement and absolutely great entertainment. The multiple storylines and character development was here, Po didn't have much development but at the same time we got to know most of his backstory in the trilogy. The new fox character (Zhen) was a surprisingly good character, I wished that the furious five could be here (Po's old friends, and this is not a spoiler!) but Zhen did just carrie the role greatly as Po's new fellow. She is very likable, and her backstory makes her a convincing character. I think the film did a great job at showing friendship and that everyone has its up and downs. I can mention the villain lastly, The Chameleon, that is a form-changing witch that seeks only that one thing: Power. Personally I don't know if I liked her a lot. She was ok for the film, her design looked very great, but as a villain it's the least interesting. She could have that one thing, one detail, that could make her a more rememberable character. Besides that, not too bad. The runtime for the film was perfect, there wasn't one moment I was bored, and the action, dialogues and animation makes it very stunning for a family cartoon. The action sequences were fast-paced and epic, and the transitions, fighting moves and cool drawn angles made it a great cinematic experience. The ending is good and closes the movie perfectly, including the Britney Spears song: ""Baby one more time"" but singed by Jack Black, the voice actor for Po. He gave the song a new, fresh look and I really liked it for the end credits. Summarizing, Kung Fu Panda 4 was a good family film, it still has the grip, I really liked the new character, as well as the action, music and animation. A worthy sequel to the beloved trilogy, and something you should definitely watch!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

It doesn't quite hit the same high notes as the first couple of movies did, feeling a bit like they're just going through the motions.The movie throws in a few new faces and keeps the action rolling, but it kinda feels like we've seen it all before. The excitement of discovering what Po and his friends are up to has faded a bit, making this more of a cozy movie night pick than a must-see blockbuster.

The film again doesn't have to do much to entertain the fans of the Kung Fu Panda franchise and DreamWorks studios. The animation has been upgraded super well, the action sequences are choreographed well, and the magic of Jack Black shines bright as ever. The only thing that left me hanging once again as did the 3rd installment was the lack of much adult and dark storyline which I loved DreamWorks for. The plot feels very kid-friendly and although it's not a bad thing, it leaves you wanting more. The ending was decided in the first 10 minutes and the rest feels like a filler of what could have been an amazing journey in the life of the dragon warrior. Although the lack of Furious Five wasn't a big downgrade, I really wish to see the seriousness of Kung Fu Panda 2 in the future although it's very unlikely.PROS:CONS:","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

While the animation is undeniably breathtaking, with vibrant colors and fluid action sequences, it's not enough to compensate for the lackluster narrative. The story feels disjointed, as if it's merely stringing together loosely connected plot points without a clear direction.Moreover, character development takes a backseat in this installment. Po and his friends feel like caricatures of themselves, with little growth or depth to their personalities. Even the introduction of new characters fails to inject freshness into the franchise, as they are underdeveloped and serve merely as plot devices rather than fully realized individuals.One of the biggest disappointments of Kung Fu Panda 4 is its missed opportunity to explore deeper themes and emotions. The earlier films touched on themes of identity, belonging, and self-discovery with poignancy and depth. However, in this installment, these themes are barely scratched upon, leaving the audience yearning for more substance.Overall, Kung Fu Panda 4 falls short of recapturing the magic of the franchise. While it may entertain younger audiences with its flashy visuals and slapstick humor, longtime fans will likely find themselves longing for the heart and soul that made the series so special. It's a disappointing entry that fails to live up to its predecessors' legacy.","15 out of 29 found this helpful.

I like how each movie has felt like a steppingstone on Po's journey of self-discovery. In KUNG FU PANDA 4, Po (Jack Black) has been the Dragon Warrior for a while now, kicking butt and taking names. His Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) has told him he is now ready to name his successor, while he becomes the new spiritual leader of the Valley of Peace. Meanwhile, a power-hungry shape-shifting sorceress known as The Chameleon (Viola Davis) is on the hunt for Po's staff of Wisdom, to summon past masters from the spirit world and steal their kung fu. Sadly, the Furious Five are not in this installment, probably due to budget constraints. Instead, Po teams up with a thieving fox that reminds me of a female Sly Cooper, Zhen (Awkwafina). Yes, I know you've probably heard Awkwafina's unique voice way too often these days, but her character in this isn't as grating and annoying as it has been in the past. I like the message of this movie, that change isn't always bad. Overcoming your fear of a significant change in your life is a part of life, for all of us. The animation is top-notch, the action scenes are fun as is the voice-acting. Jack Black and Bryan Cranston really go all out, I love how they got Ian McShane back as well. It didn't pull me in like the last 3 did, but I think that's because it's not aimed towards people who have grown up with this franchise. A little bit more towards kids than the last 3. KUNG FU PANDA 4 might be the weakest in the franchise for that reason, but I still enjoyed it. If they do make another one, I hate to think it'll be a cash-grab, like this one almost is.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This film has everything we need from the Kung fu panda franchise except for some parts which I didn't like but overall it's a worth watch.Talking about the storyline yes I think director & writer gets it right this time because it has an engaging storyline with a new journey or a mission that Po has to go to get things right. A journey filled with lots of humour and emotions add into it.But what I'm disappointed about that they didn't do justice with the characters like Furious 5. I mean After Po they are the souls of the Kung fu panda franchise and this film completely washed that characters and instead they just keep it for the small cameo which I felt is a total injustice.Cinematography & screenplay is very good and enjoyable specially the chemistry between Po & Zhen is quite good and carries the whole film around. Dads are awesome and their did their part very well.Action sequences is totally unique and brilliantly choreograph in the film specially 1-2 scenes with Po is simply brilliant.Visual effects & sound design top notch no complaints over there and same goes for the humour for the Po's character which won't bore you and keep you laughable till the end.Overall I had a great experience watching this film after a long time and if you are fan of this franchise then this film will definitely puts a smile on your face.....","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Po is joined by Master Shifu (a red panda), Tai Lung (a snow leopard), and Zhen.That said, this movie, in this premise, is good. That's because of the great animation this film has. A great animation I say because it has a lot of secondary animation, that is motions generated as a reaction to the movement of primary motion by a character. Other good thing is the production design, that is very good too, cause goes very well with the characters, feels fluid. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer, is fine too by reason of makes me feel in the mood that the sound director wanted me to feel at that moment. And the movie has a satisfactory comedy, made me laugh a lot when I was watching the movie.Nonetheless, this movie has some problems too.The writing in this movie is a problem due to the fast pacing because some character feels flat, like the villain, who have no motivation at all in this movie. I mean that she doesn't have a good backstory or something to be interested. Feels flat.I wanted to see the furious five in this movie. Cause in the other movies they were needed, but in this movie they were not even showed. That's sad.In conclusion, this movie is good, a solid movie, that has a lot of good things and some flaws.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie Kung Fu Panda 4 (2024) was incredibly fun and funny with beautiful animation, likable old and new characters, fun and amazing looking action sequences, and great voice acting; the villain was cool but could have been in the movie more because of what she can do and who voices her, with the movie occasionally being predictable, which is why I say this is not as good as the first two films but is as good as the third film.Jack Black is once again fantastic as the character Po making him still a funny and likable character, with him being used to the Dragon Warrior title and protecting people everywhere in the valley of peace; I do like the premise of him having to train someone else to be the new Dragon Warrior despite not wanting to, but also having to come to grips with himself by accepting change to his life. The new character named Zhen, voiced very well by Awkwafina, being a thief dragged in to help Po on his mission to stop the main villain, was funny and a likable character with her and Po building a good friendship and working well together throughout the film, and her learning to trust people again after something that happened in her past. Lastly, you have Po's dads Mr. Ping and Li, voiced great again by James Hong and Bryan Cranston, who were funny, and they follow Po on his journey thinking he might not be able to defeat this new threat but also learn to change for the better; also, though Shifu is not in the movie that much, Dustin Hoffman voicing him again is great and he had some funny moments with him trying to get Po to find a new Dragon Warrior.The villain The Chameleon was a cool enough villain with Viola Davis doing very well in voicing her, though she has a plan of stealing other kung fu masters fighting skills to take over the valley of peace, she needed more of a backstory and needed to be on screen more because of how cool she was; also, though Tai Lung is not in the movie that except for the third act, it was still cool to have Ian McShane back to voice him. The animation was beautiful with its pretty landscapes, details/textures on the characters, and being able to be fast paced when needed to for the action; the movie was very funny, and the action sequences were amazing with the fast-paced animation style and nice visuals making them incredible and fun to watch. Last thing, the movie can be a bit predictable at times so you might know where it is heading, despite it not harming what I think about the film, there were a couple of moments I was not expecting.This is not as good as the first two films but is as good as the third film, and considering this is the fourth entry in the series, it could have been worse that what we got since fourth installments in big, animated franchises like this can be bad; luckily, Kung Fu Panda 4 (2024) was very fun and funny with beautiful animation, likable characters, fun and amazing looking action sequences, and great voice acting. I will end by saying that this is a nice ending to the Kung Fu Panda franchise, and they should stop here without making another one; DreamWorks has made a fun set of animated movies for us to watch with a likable main character and a likable actor voicing him, that being Jack Black, which is why I highly recommend watching these four movies whenever given a chance.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Fans around the world have been eagerly waiting for this animated installment; however, adding more films to an existing franchise always comes with risks such as losing originality and screaming for innovation, which is very important when it comes to adding new entry to the beloved franchise. The Kung Fu Panda series is considered an exceptional example of animation excellence due to its seamless blend of humor, and action-packed scenes filled with heartwarming moments- successfully captivating audiences from young kids to adults.Unfortunately, in 'Kung Fu Panda 4' there's a noticeable fatigue that may leave fans disappointed - ideas just don't seem fresh anymore when compared to its predecessor, although some charm still remains within parts thereof. However, the differences in writing and direction are palpable and sadly, it's very unfortunate for a movie that many of us have been waiting for.It's difficult to ignore that the narrative and character development in ""Kung Fu Panda 4"" appear stagnant and rather pedestrian. The once lively exchanges between adored characters have lost their charm, making it challenging for viewers to stay invested. Although the premise remains true to its root, the plot feels repetitive without introducing anything fresh or imaginative. Consequently rendering a sense of repetitiveness like watching Po's story replayed instead of progressing further. This movie falters with pacing difficulty within the first half and an absence of engaging subplots resulting in struggling progression.The screenplay is serviceable but doesn't quite spark the same level of imagination as its predecessors. It seems like the writers relied too heavily on a formulaic plot structure that ultimately failed to engage viewers fully. Nonetheless, there are some standout moments in the film when they explore themes surrounding adaptation and growth. One aspect that's always shone through in previous ""Kung Fu Panda"" films was their lively ensemble cast - each character brimming with individual charm and eccentricities. However, this time around we find less depth in characterization overall; while certain scenes still capture our attention at times, there just isn't enough chemistry between voice actors and their respective roles to leave us truly invested along every step of Po's journey for instance or any other protagonist featured throughout Kung-Fu-panda 4 series..It appears that the narrative structure of ""Kung Fu Panda 4"" has a formulaic quality, giving the impression that the screenplay ticks boxes instead of delivering an engaging story. Unfortunately, this inflexibility eliminates any organic progression in character development and plot trajectory which we've grown accustomed to in past installments. Displeasingly, while trying to win over new fans with younger generations as its target audience, it overlooks loyal followers who have matured since its initial release back in 2008. It's unfortunate for the latter audiences because storytelling and character arcs appear mediocre at best; they failed where once they excelled hence losing their ability to engage audiences like previously achieved by their predecessors - particularly disappointing when comparing both first/second halves of the movie given how slow things become chronologically. ""Kung Fu Panda 4"" fails to match its predecessors in terms of the clever humor woven into its conversations, as well as the complexity and depth that come from the carefully constructed layers seen in earlier installments.While the narrative of ""Kung Fu Panda 4"" may not have the same impact and grandeur as its previous installments, the voice performances remained the highlight of the movie. Jack Black once again brings his exceptional talent to the role of Po, and Awkwafina's vibrant and engaging portrayal adds a new layer of interest to the story. The film regains its momentum when Po discovers himself amidst an old tavern community where Zhen brings new life to it all. This breath of fresh air elevates the movie beyond its formulaic plot making us reminisce why we were so enamored by the franchise in its inception: through heartwarming interactions within this community adding depth only genuine affection can provide.DreamWorks Animation has once again demonstrated their exceptional artistry in ""Kung Fu Panda 4"". Audiences are transported into a beautifully rendered ancient China with rich and vivid backdrops that leave viewers captivated. The exhilarating action scenes elevate the senses, particularly noteworthy is Po's encounter with an impressive stingray thanks to its fluid animation which showcases the franchise's ability to deliver top-tier visual narratives. Despite these breathtaking moments, some pacing issues hinder it from reaching its full potential as they slightly take away from the overall impact of this masterpiece's spectacle on screen.In all its glory, the movie delivers a story about accepting change and embracing a new way of living - and in this case, it's a new way of being a hero. This theme resonates with audiences of all ages, from kids who are mostly experiencing changes in transitioning from childhood to teenage life and adult audiences who are facing new adversaries of life. This is where I think the movie shines and finds its footing, offering another poignant message that is both timely and relevant for everyone. Just as we witness Po steers and sail through the challenges of this new chapter, the audiences are reminded of how important it is for us to be resilient and adaptable in this ever-changing world. The introduction of the new character, Zhen voiced by Awkwafina, helps to underscore the message of ""embracing change,"" providing a fresh take on the value of this theme. The movie has successfully relayed the message throughout the narrative and serves as a stark reminder that change is inevitable and we have to accept the fact that all we can do is just to live through it, a lesson that holds true outside the movie theater.Despite its flaws, ""Kung Fu Panda 4"" is still a family-friendly movie that can provide a pleasant viewing experience for all ages. While it may not have the same impact and level of entertainment compared to the first or second film, which I think is the best in its series, it's a safe continuation for those who have followed Po's adventures since 2008. It's similar to finding an extra dumpling in your bamboo steamer - not necessary, but a small, delightful surprise. In conclusion, ""Kung Fu Panda 4"" may have its evident flaws and mishaps, but it still offers a worthwhile viewing experience for new and old fans of the series. While the storytelling and characterization may feel lackluster at times, the film's stunning animation and meaningful themes help to elevate making it a rather mediocre and not an extraordinary experience. It may not be the standout chapter fans were hoping for, but it's a gentle reminder that, like Po, we must all learn to embrace the changes life throws our way while holding dear the memories of the past.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I wish it was just Po as with the previous Kung Fu Panda.Binge-watching the trilogy right before this, I've noticed they follow the same formula. The antagonist gets a dark and ominous intro, typically at the movie's beginning. Po faces a new challenge to advance in the Kung Fu world, only to hear of a villain calling him out and about to wreak havoc in the middle of it. In the end, good triumphs. It becomes quite predictable, and even Po's relationship with Zhen feels a bit too on the nose.Visually I think it's the same as all the movies. I like that it was consistent because I think the animation's timeless and kids of different generations can enjoy. I was curious to see at who the movie was aimed at, because the first Kung Fu Panda movie came out in 2008. I was 9, and everyone who saw it then is grown up now. So would it still be a kids movie for those of us who saw it as a kid then.I think the movie fits into the franchise. I think it had a little more going on, it wasn't as simple as the earlier movies. In terms of production quality and how good the movies are, I think all 4 movies are pretty similar. But it's like having the same good meal over and over, eventually it won't have that same magic to it. And that's how I felt about this.The movie fit directly into the franchise timeline, but in real life I think it was made too long after the first movie; maybe even too long after the previous one back in 2016.It's still pretty funny. I loved the ""inner peace, dinner please"" line, and the running joke about the urn that keeps getting destroyed. I think this has more jokes, But the earlier movie's had more knockout laughs. Pretty formulaic in its structure like the previous three movies.I absolutely loved the cast, especially Viola Davis and Awkwafina, whose voices are distinct. However, throughout the entire movie, I couldn't shake the feeling that maybe they didn't have the budget to hire the rest of the Furious Five back. Viola Davis was spectacular, but I found her character less compelling than the previous three antagonists. Tai Lung, in particular, still stands out as the most menacing presence in this movie even though chameleon was the big bad. While Viola Davis did a great job, I felt Chameleon could've been better. My expectations were high because the previous three movies aimed for memorable villains, and I really love Kai from the last one. Chameleon, unfortunately, didn't feel as special and seemed like a blend of previous villains.I enjoyed it, not as good as I thought it was gonna be though. This felt like a Po special, or a solo spinoff. I wish the rest of the furious 5 were in it. I do like how it set up the possibility more sequels though; instead of just going straight to rebooting a franchise this felt like it was soft-launching the new dragon warrior.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I can see it being appealing to children only, unlike the previous movies that came with strong messages, great storytelling and content to inspire different age groups. It lacked the emotional gravitas that each movie successfully put. The 1st dealt with Po's self-esteem and struggle of self acceptance, the 2nd dealt with him having inner peace and embracing his past, and the 3rd built upon the previous two and dealt with Po's identity and his journey of self discovery. This one felt unnecessary and hollow.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

This movie is one that parents can enjoy with their children. It's no Shrek or Monsters, Inc. Which are a couple of the best animated movies for all ages, but I enjoyed my time at the movies and I know my almost 4-year old did as well. There are so many good one-liners. Jack Black and Awkwafina's delivery is of course incredible. EGOT winner herself, Viola Davis, voices the villain and does an incredible job. She won the Grammy making her an historic EGOT recipient for the audiobook narration of her memoir. Why? Because her voice is that good. Finally, the violent children are the best part of the film.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Nothing more and nothing less, but the first movie in particular was far better than I expected it to be. For that reason alone, I'll always give the sequels a chance. I have to admit though that I thought this franchise had reached its conclusion with the third instalment, which was eight years ago now. Well, after watching this fourth instalment, even though I didn't mind watching it, it's not as special as it once was. Here's why I feel this is the weakest Kung Fu Panda movie.About to become a new leader for his people, Po (Jack Black) must find a replacement for his title of Dragon Warrior. With the emergence of a new villain in The Chameleon (Viola Davis), Po teams up with a new character named Zhen (Awkwafina) and they embark on a journey to find her. Her powers can bring back previous franchise villains from the spirit realm and Po may have to face some old enemies along the way. She can also shapeshift into anything and anyone, including our main characters, which is a trope many movies have done before, but it was enjoyable enough here. Look, there just isn't the same amount of heart as the previous movies and the biggest glaring issue is the absence of the Furious Five.The Furious Five (for those of you unaware of the previous movies) is an elite team that eventually put Po in the position he is in now. Their presence as side characters throughout the franchise was honestly what added to the stories. This time, they are completely written out in favour of one sidekick and a smaller budget for the movie. This bled through and became a distracting piece that just felt missing. I'm sure a far better film could've been made that didn't include them, but having the same energy as the first three, while not nearly as much fun, made Kung Fu Panda 4 kind of feel pointless, even though I still enjoyed watching it for what it was.This is a movie that will probably find a large audience with kids, but I'm not sure how many adults will find this one entertaining. For being a movie about Kung Fu, there's also a lot less action and it's by far the shortest entry when you take out the credits. In many ways, this feels thrown together for a quick cash grab, which I honestly understand if you're a studio thinking about which franchises can still be profitable, it's just that more care could've easily been put in. This is in no way a bad movie, it's just a watchable animated sequel that had a few nice moments. With a couple of solid laughs and a touching finale, I'll recommend this one to kids, but it's not something to rush out for.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Swapping out Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, David Cross, Lucy Lui and (mostly) Seth Rogan for Awkwafina, the film teams Po up with an in-the-know thief and sends him on a quest to defeat the mysterious shape-shifting Chameleon who holds an iron grip on one of China's most dense cities. It arguably makes up for its lack of furious five with its inclusion of Po's two dads - who, incidentally, could easily be mistaken for a gay couple if you haven't seen the previous picture (or maybe their co-parenting really has blossomed into romance, who knows?) - because they're really fun and it's nice to hear James Hong and Bryan Cranston do exactly what they need to. Jack Black continues to impress as the eponymous panda, while Dustin Hoffman is still surprisingly engaged with his small yet important role and Ian McShane has fun chewing up the CGI scenery once more. Viola Davis does decent work, but her villain is easily the weakest in the series and just isn't all that threatening overall (despite everyone saying she's Po's most dangerous foe to date). Awkwafina isn't bad, by the way, but her character isn't particularly interesting - primarily because her arc is extremely predictable (at least to me). The narrative in general is a little bit weak, and the themes certainly aren't as potent as those of the first two films. Thankfully, the animation is still excellent and, while not as stylised as that of the previous picture, brings genuine vibrancy to even the stalest of plot beats. There are several really enjoyable set-pieces that perfectly toe the line between being silly and awesome, making sure the protagonist remains as goofy as ever while still being able to do some serious damage when he needs to. It is interesting to see him take a more measured approach to most of his encounters, and his actions - both micro and macro - reflect where he is in his overarching development. The experience is entertaining pretty much from start to finish, even though it does have a few rough patches. In particular, it doesn't get off to the best start, and initially seems like it's maybe only going to be one or two steps above one of those spin-off shows that just doesn't have the charm of the movies. However, it soon settles into itself and is considerably better than that, cementing itself as a proper cinematic entry in a film series that's never had a bad entry. Though this is certainly the weakest of the four, it's still an enjoyable and well-crafted 'Kung-Fu Panda' picture that keeps you engaged for its duration. It's a solid effort, despite its flaws.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

But that's too generous to put as a title.The signs are all there. The plot is practically nonexistent. There is no story, no journey. They scrapped everything they could, and replaced it with whatever they could fit into the 85mil$ budget. Which is about half of what the first movie used to cost, with adjustment for inflation. While I wouldn't specifically call the ""plot"" of this movie bad, it is one avenue they could've pursued with this franchise - the way it is presented is, like I said, done with the grace of a TV episode. And not an installment. I mean - this is the only movie I can recall that doesn't even have its characters introduced. That's right - their names come up as if some part of the script was abandoned. And, judging by the leaks and rumors regarding production - that may very well have been the case. I just... didn't believe that a mistake so unprofessional would make it to the big screen.With that budget - there's obviously no music. Zimmer is credited for using his originals, but whoever wrote the little here-and-there ambiance for this movie - did an even worse job than the third installment.And the only thing I can say about the characters... granted that there's nothing to say for the lack of them - is whom Dreamworks chose to voice a character, who is supposed to be ""foxy"". I don't think it was for the lack of budget - with 85mil$ you can probably get one or two professional voice actors and\or actors. But the person they got, and with the importance of the role they got for her... Well, it's deplorable. These are the characters kids watch. They connect with them, they idolize them. And if Dreamworks is actually ""selling"" ""this"" to the kids... That's on top of that person not being an actress or a voice actress. And having no voice and no business to do with voice. Again, if this was a TV episode - I wouldn't be so shocked. A guest voice, guest character, some promotional stuff. They wouldn't check every bio. But is this really how they want to revive the franchise?I prefer to watch movies in their original languages. I never had problems with English. But for this one... may as well watch a dub.In conclusion, I'll say this: It's one of the movies that made me lose my braincells in 15 minutes, and which I actually closed to take a deep breath and reconsider. The opening was just that stupid. And cringe. Last time I had this shock was Dolittle(2020). And, to be entirely honest... This is better. After just turning your brains off, maybe taking a deep breath... you can more or less enjoy this ""TV episode"". If you are a fan of the franchise. But if you, like me, couldn't stomach its TV series - don't expect this movie to be anything better.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

We are big Kung Fu Panda fans and were excited for this release and, unfortunately, it fell pretty flat. The kids who were 12 and under had a good time but no one was really blown away. My 14 and 17 year old's were extremely bored. The plot is incredibly predictable and will offer little to no surprises. The moments that were intended to create levity were underwhelming and rehashed from the previous KFP installments; though I did have 2 or 3 places where I had a small chuckle. For little kids there were some fairly intense scenes that could be scary but no one had bad dreams that night.Where this movie has positives is in the messages that it promotes and in the fight scenes. At the end of the day it's still a Kung Fu Panda movie and you do get some action.Overall, your kids might like it but it's a pretty formulaic and predictable offering.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

While not outright terrible, it fails to capture the magic of its predecessors, making it the weakest link in the series. The storyline feels uninspired, and the humor often falls flat. Additionally, the antagonist, Amelia, lacks the depth and menace of previous villains, which detracts from the overall impact of the movie. Furthermore, the inclusion of reincarnated old villains adds little to the plot, as they contribute nothing of substance. While Kung Fu Panda 4 may entertain younger audiences, longtime fans will likely leave the theater feeling disappointed.I also took some time to research other reviews, and the general consensus seems to echo these sentiments, with many critics expressing similar disappointment with the film's execution.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Flawed but Fun Fourth Installment to Kung Fu Panda","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9683260/?ref_=tt_urv","jaredkjacoby","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur111679790/?ref_=tt_urv","17 March 2024","Shifu assigns Po to pick the next Dragon Warrior. However, Po does not want to give up his status that easily. When the day comes to pick the next Dragon Warrior, he picks himself. One day, a small fox named Zhen breaks into Jade Palace and attempts to steal and break stuff inside the Hall of Heroes. When Po captures her and imprisons her, the fox agrees to help Po stop the shapeshifting sorceress known as the Chameleon who wants to conquer China by stealing the skills of all of Po's enemies. Po and Zhen venture off to Juniper City where they receive a lot of negative attention.Kung Fu Panda is probably my most watched animated film of all time. I remember watching that DVD I could not count. I did see the sequel in theaters, but not the third. I wanted to see this fourth installment just because I love the first three movies and the trailers did make me curious about where the story would go. On a day where nothing went as planned, I still got to see this movie. Did it brighten my day or did it make me feel like I was climbing the stairs to Jade Palace?Kung Fu Panda 4 is a movie that does not match the quality of the original trilogy at all. Not by a long shot. For starters, the Furious Five are not in this movie at all except one cameo. I always thought they were such cool characters and want to see more from them, but they feel wasted at this point. The story has a lot of familiar tropes like the scene of walking in a tavern and raising an army for the final battle. In fact, that is a plot point similar to Kung Fu Panda 3. I feel disappointed with how Tai Lung is utilized here. He could have played a bigger role in the story and interacted with more characters, particularly Shifu. Seriously, that was a missed opportunity here. Lastly, I feel the movie is a little too short. Yes, it is a fast-paced adventure packed with action, but with a story like this, a lot of the problems I have could be fixed if the movie was just a little longer. Some of the characters could get a bit more development and we could learn more about the antagonist. With my negatives out of the way, let me talk about what I liked about this movie.Kung Fu Panda 4 has several issues, but I enjoyed overall. First of all, the voice acting is terrific. Jack Black has not lost a bit of enthusiasm or heart as Po. He brings his A-game here delivering some great emotions and a lot of the funnier lines. Po is just as likable as ever. I like how he is just a normal nice person who doesn't make a scene about, particularly when he shares his cookie with Zhen. Speaking of Zhen, I like this character a lot. She is a nice refreshing take on the lovable rogue who steals to survive. Her twist in the third act surprised me a little bit, but the movie foreshadows it in a clever way. Also, her character is just adorable. She is a snarky fox with a lot attitude and a speedy fighting style. Awkwafina is excellent as Zhen. She handles her snarking scenes very well, but she excels in her dramatic scenes in the third act. Her acting comes off as genuine and she has a very sweet emotional scene here. She is known for comedic roles, but I think this is Awkwafina's best performance I have seen from her so far. Po and Zhen share great chemistry together. They bounce off each other's personalities perfectly and their banter made me smile several times. It helps that Jack Black and Awkwafina have a lot of fun interacting with each other. I can tell that with this film, they are probably friends in real life.As for the supporting cast, Po's dads have a really fun subplot that shows how concerned they are for their son. They go on a journey themselves to make sure Po is safe. I enjoy them because they are good, but flawed dads who will stop at nothing to protect their son. I particularly love Bryan Cranston's performance as Li Shan. He plays a character who tries to be intimidating and scary who is actually a big chicken themselves. I can see that Cranston had a lot of fun here. James Hong is really good here too. He does not sound any different here than he did from 2008. As for the rest of the supporting cast, we have a trio of cute but deadly rabbits who are awesome, Han who is a fun, but underutilized leader of a den of thieves voiced by Ke Huy Quan and Captain Fish who is kind of a unique character who again, I wish was utilized a bit more. I see a lot of potential in the supporting cast, but the movie focuses on Po, his dads, Zhen and the Chameleon the most.Speaking of the Chameleon, I am mixed with her. Tai Lung, Shen and Kai were all amazing villains for different reasons, but the Chameleon lacks the coolness of them. She has to earn more of her powers by copying the powers of Po's enemies. However, what she lacks in fighting style, she makes up for with her manipulation and shapeshifting abilities. Also, I get the feeling that she is more loathsome than the other antagonists because she is more reliant on cheap tricks than skill. I like Viola Davis' performance as the Chameleon. She comes off as a cold, ruthless leader who can intimidate anyone. Davis seemed like she was having a great time voicing this character. The cast of characters are great overall, but there can be improvements for sure.The story focuses a lot on trust and how to take more responsibility. Po does not want to give up his position as the Dragon Warrior. I do not blame him. I get the feeling that he likes being a hero not just because it's cool, but he enjoys helping citizens out and that has always endeared me to Po. That being said, the movie shows that he is being a bit selfish and immature about his task to pick the next Dragon Warrior. One message I like is that the idea that it is never too late to do the right thing or become a better person. Since one of the main characters is a thief who has quite a reputation in Juniper City, this is meant to encourage audience to change their lives when they are in sticky situations like this. I wish it was a bit more tapped on because it is a great message, but that is only a minor complaint. The humor is not bad but not hysterical. It had me smiling throughout, but I did not laugh hard often. Never cringed either though and that is just as important. Cringeworthy comedy can be a death sentence for a movie like this, but Kung Fu Panda 4 avoids that. I like what they tried to do with the story. They tried to take a different approach by having a new successor to Po as the Dragon Warrior and have him go to a new city where he has no recognition. I like that Po is now the one guiding his friend to become a better person and fighter. Not everything worked with the story, but I liked it.Despite having the lowest budget of the Kung Fu Panda movies, I think this movie looks gorgeous. The textures, the character designs and movement look great. The environments are creative and fit the chaotic Juniper City well. The action scenes are a ton of fun to watch, though none of them top the first movie's insane scenes. To be fair, topping the first movie's action scenes is extremely hard because that movie has some of my favorite battles in any movie. In this movie, Zhen is so much fun to watch beat down enemies much bigger than her. Her speed and trickery give more depth to the fights. Po gets a pretty awesome fight scene in the fog. The fight at the tavern is memorable too as it showcases the contrasting personalities of Po and Zhen perfectly. The climactic battle with the Chameleon is fun to watch because she takes full advantage of her powers and the powers of the villains she stole from. The action scenes are awesome and there are plenty of them.The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Steve Mazzaro is quite good. It is epic and has plenty of memorable tunes. The sound design is great as well, especially the scene with Po fighting in the fog. I like the muffled sounds as it is a touch of the mystery of being surrounded by fog.I enjoyed Kung Fu Panda 4. It is nowhere near as good as the trilogy, but it is a solid addition to this awesome series of animated films. I think this movie had a lot of heart put into it despite its faults. Kids and adults will have a good time with this one. I felt like my experience with this movie is the one thing that went right with my day as nothing I planned went through except this. I am happy I got to see one of my favorite characters on the big screen one more time.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Jack Black remains a vocal powerhouse as Po, and the animation is decent, though lacking the wow factor of the earlier films.However, the plot feels reheated. Po faces a new villain, sure, but the whole ""teacher seeking a successor"" angle treads similar ground to Po's journey in Kung Fu Panda 2. The villain themself, the Chameleon, is forgettable, and their motivations feel underdeveloped.While the action sequences are undeniably fun and flashy, they can't quite mask the sense of deja vu. If you're looking for something fresh, Kung Fu Panda 4 won't deliver. But for a familiar serving of kung fu fun with a side of Po's charm, it's a decent watch. Just don't expect a groundbreaking story.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I remember my excitement on the last day of school, waiting to be released so I could go see the first movie in theaters. I remember getting a box of Eggo waffles that had the characters printed on them and finding out I could get a pillow of Po's face (which I got). It's a pivotal part of my childhood, was my favorite movie for a long time, and still holds up to this day. The second movie is also fantastic, and the third is really good, albeit with some flaws. And this fourth entry, while easily the weakest link, still provides a good time at the theater.The easiest positive I can name is the animation. The settings and especially the fights in this movie look amazing. The choreography and uniqueness of the action outdoes pretty much every other movie in the franchise, where the fights are epic yet simple hand-to-hand combat. Here, characters interact with their environments a lot more, using pillars and tables as projectiles and defenses and using weapons that litter the areas. This is where the film shines brightest.Another positive I can give is the voice acting. Jack Black continues to lead these films as Po, and Viola Davis brings so much to the antagonist. Her voice alone can make The Chameleon an intimidating figure in any scene. While many may consider it a nostalgic cashgrab, Ian McShane's return as Tai Lung is still great, and he has a few lines in here that really cut and remind you why he was such a threat in the first movie. And finally, the film is only 94 minutes. So if you don't like it but want to finish it, it won't eat up more than 2 hours.However, that briefness lends itself to a critique I have: parts of the film feel a little fast. There's very little breathing room for the characters to just sit and relax, with the plot going from scene to scene to scene. The few moments that do lend themselves to a breather are cuts back to Po's dads as they follow him to make sure he's alright. If there had been an extra ten minutes that allowed characters more time to develop, I think it would've helped a lot.My other big critique is the amount of humor in the film. It's also something I think the third film does, while the first two had a much better balance of humor and serious moments. There are several moments where a character will drop an unnecessary one-liner that, at best, got an amused exhale out of me. I don't hold it too much against the film, because it seems to be something that plagues a lot of contemporary movies and was likely demanded to be included by the executives. There were plenty of jokes that worked, but I think that a little less would have been a lot more.But at the end of the day, I don't hate this movie. It was fun, it has a good message, and most importantly, the little kids watching the film enjoyed it. They were all around the age I was when the first film came out, and that just reminded me of my own excitement 15-16 years ago (jeez). While it may not be the peak of the series, it still has a good place, and I wouldn't skip it if I were to marathon the movies in the future.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Shrek, Madagascar, How To Train Your Dragon, The Croods, etc, reminding you of the pedigree this studio has. KFP4 keeps the same animated wonder of the previous films, the thumping sound track (I've had the film version of Crazy Train on my commute soundtrack for weeks) but - possibly due to the strikes in Hollywood - lacked the heart the last films had with it's casting, leaving Po a lot more isolated than integrated.He's now been the great Dragon Warrior for 16 years, yet they still have him asking why, and rather than developing him, they have him developing others. He can kick butt, he has the staff from KFP3 (as seen in the posters), yet what else has he taken from the other outings ?The quest - cos there's always a quest - is a telegraphed setup for the final reveal, that gave me Zootopia vibes, not helped by Po's walking partner being a sneaky fox.The main villain is a sorceress chameleon, capable of great change on the outside, but seemingly not so much on the inside, which never really gets unpacked. Is it all just for show? She can become whomever she wants, sound like them, yet isn't them. The first two films had villain motivation front and centre, this needs more walking to find.We watched the action in 4DX. The extra meta was fun; you get tossed around in the fight and chase scenes, you get wet in the water scenes and the puffs of air as things fly past, yet compared to Elementals, it lacks the subtly in scenes; at times being a Panda to the face.One big take away; my kids really want to see Shifus back story. Maybe a break from the Panda could get the world back in line.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The cast and voice acting was fine. The characters are fine, though I do wish the Furious 5 and many of the characters from the previous films were in movie. The story is alright but could've been a lot better. The jokes were weaker than the previous films, some did get a chuckle out of me but most were less funny. Chameleon was byfar the most disappointing part of the movie in my opinion. For such a unique kind of villain, I feel she was a pretty lame and failed to live up to her potential.Overall, Kung Fu Panda 4 is decent but ultimately disappointing entry in the Kung Fu Panda franchise that leaves a lot to be desired.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The first three films were each a comedic masterpiece. Everything in them - the characters' background and their species, the culture, wonderfully written music, the voice acting - was carefully crafted and harmoniously put together to reach perfection. The scene beats, the timing, the punch lines, and most importantly, the animation connecting it all together and making the most out of subtle tones in the actors' voices - everything in them was so exquisitely done that it's an absolute joy and inspiration to watch them every time. They are surprisingly profound and never fail to jerk a tear or a dozen from me.I rewatched the first three films before seeing this one and I had this unsettling feeling that they were going to screw the fourth one up. Sadly, I was right. The whole film feels extremely cheaply made by someone with zero comedic sense. Or they just didn't care much and carelessly and lazily slapped the whole thing together. Everything feels rushed, all the jokes fall flat on the face, the timing is completely off between and within the scenes, and the animation is so disconnected from the voice acting that it's just painful to watch. Every choice the directors make in this film feels just so very wrong. Some of the voice acting from the original cast is still fairly good (except for James Hong who was pure genius in the first three films, but in this one sounds like someone is choking him), but they still just do not click with whatever is happening on the screen. The plot is a complete mess, nothing happening makes any sense. The majority of new character voiceover is uninspired and boring.This franchise was incredibly resistant to the sequel decay seen in many other productions, and the first two successors to the initial masterpiece did an incredible job at maintaining its legacy, and improving on it. But sadly, they did not quit while ahead and their greed for more money doomed them to the same old sad outcome. Sure, they'll still make a ton of money off the brand name, especially compared to how much they clearly spent on this film, but at least in my eyes this will always remain as an unnecessary disappointment. I can only imagine what the other two new films are going to be like.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Tai-Lang for example went from a powerful villain with deep and dark thoughts, to a weak and confused character who can't even fight.The plot of the movie isn't really interesting. The introduction to the story is a little hasty, there is no real challenge, no epic battles, and the ending is kind of stupid and obvious from the beginning.But all this being said, I had fun watching it, and I hope the franchise doesn't end here.

I'm a big fan of this franchise, so much so that one of my first reviews was for the original film. I have to admit though after seeing the third film I felt the franchise had come to a suitable conclusion and the franchise would stay as a strong trilogy. Add dreamworks poor financial state with box office flops like Ruby Gillman and awful straight to streaming releases like the new Megamind sequel and here we are with a fourth Kung Fu Panda film. With that in mind it would be easy to think this was a desperate cash in on an already established franchise and one that could damage the integrity of the original trilogy. I am however happy to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this outing.The big controversy with this film was the omission of the furious five that appeared in the previous three films and had become fan favourite characters. The film goes some way to explaining where the five are while this new adventure is taking place however it's about the most basic explanation they could have given.The five are instead replaced this time around with a new companion Zhen. Voiced by Awkwafina Zhen is a thieving fox whose sticky fingers often get her into trouble. Her character was a pleasant surprise, based on the trailer I thought I was going to find her character annoying however she wasn't and actually had a big part to play in the story rather than just being a companion so that Po isn't alone on his travels. That being said however she doesn't compare to the furious five and I did still miss their kung Fu antics but I guess the budget didn't stretch far enough for the voice talents of the likes of Jackie Chan.One of the things that has always been so consistent with this franchise is strong themes and lessons that both children and adults can relate to. This time around the theme is around change and how difficult change can be but how actually sometimes change is necessary in order for us to become better versions of ourselves. Yet again this is another strongly conveyed message and one that I can certainly relate to in my own personal life at the moment.With slick action sequences and witty quips this is another Po outing for the whole family to enjoy.Plus this film gives us the brilliant Tenacious D cover of Britney's Hit Me Baby One More Time, what's not to like?","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The main character did nothing new or special and pretty much behaved exactly like you would expect him to behave. No character growth whatsoever. I think with Jack Black's retirement, the makes are trying to move the main role from being Panda to some other animal so they can keep milking the series forever. Its odd that the movie series is called ""Kung Fu Panda"" with an emphasis on ""Panda"" but now the dragon warrior will be someone completely different.

The story was at least as good as any of the other ones the animation was good and the voice acting was great. And there were no annoying slow parts, it was a great movie, we enjoyed it thoroughly. If you get a chance to see it in 3D, it's worth it I think that made it even better. It's also about the right length for this type of movie, anything longer is tough to get through with children, anything shorter feels too short. I would recommend this to anyone with kids or anyone that was a fan of any of the other movies.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I decided to inform myself as little as possible and went with very low expectations. The problem of the film was seen very quickly: it is that animal that gives foxes little honor. The character is unfriendly and his story generates revulsion. Is redemption possible for someone capable of doing what this secondary character did? The film teaches that yes; Our experience indicates not. The general tone of the characters oscillates between naivety and stupidity. Even the villain literally copies the same strategy as the villain from the previous film, demonstrating that creativity is a very rare commodity. I decided to test myself; If I laughed three times the film would fulfill its purpose. And I laughed three times but precisely at the more secondary characters who fortunately were good food relief. The ending offends intelligence with Kung Fu panda getting along more than well with the murderer of his mother. With the plot twist they gave to the film they killed the saga and in the process gave a very minor shine to the funny furious five who barely appear. Medium film, nothing to celebrate.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The villain is admittedly very cool. Her abilities are unique and she looks cool. Her motivation is just that's she's evil. The first scene was super cool and I was hopeful and then it all went down hill. The big issue is the characters are just annoying and refuse to make logical decisions. It was frustrating to watch.

This 2024 installment sees our hero, Po, grappling with a midlife crisis that's less about sports cars and more about who gets to wear the fancy Dragon Warrior title next.The plot is as comforting and predictable as a reheated bowl of noodle soup. Po, in an existential twist, is no longer just the belly-flopping warrior we've come to adore but is now also the Spiritual Leader of the Valley of Peace. The catch? He's got to pass on his butt-kicking legacy. Enter a shapeshifting baddie, the Chameleon, who, in a move that screams ""villainy 101"", brings back three of Po's greatest hits... er, I mean foes. Because, why invent new characters when the old ones can still pack a punch?But fear not, dear viewer, for our tale introduces Zhen, a plucky fox with the street smarts of a big-city guide and the kind of character energy that screams, ""I've got an action figure in production."" Zhen leads Po on a merry chase into what could easily be mistaken for a tourist's guide through the Chameleon's lair, ensuring the movie's set-piece quota is well and truly met.""Kung Fu Panda 4"" is the cinematic equivalent of a warm hug; it's nice, it's light-hearted, and it's got that adorable factor cranked up to eleven. It's like watching your childhood teddy bear earn a black belt in cuteness. The movie serves up a sense of closure for the franchise that'll make you feel emotional, offering a farewell that feels a bit like leaving a childhood friend behind.However, let's address the panda in the room - the plot does feel like it was copied and pasted from the ""Big Book of Animated Movie Clichés"". It's as if the writers were playing a game of narrative bingo with plot points from the previous films. And while the journey is enjoyable, it's akin to ordering your favorite dish at a restaurant only to find it's not quite as satisfying as you remember. It leaves you full, sure, but nostalgically longing for the zest of the first dish.In conclusion, ""Kung Fu Panda 4"" is okay. It's not going to redefine the genre, but it'll definitely make you want to hug someone (or something) fluffy. It's the kind of movie you watch when you need a reminder that the world can be a cute, cuddly place, even if it's just for 90 minutes. And while it may not have the punchy impact of its forebears, it's a farewell that reminds us why we fell in love with a kung fu-fighting panda in the first place.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I will say there's some that has let me down like how the story didn't take enough time to make the franchise a comeback and some characters like Chameleon and (sometimes) Zhen being uninteresting, along with the fact the Furious Five only appeared right at the ending and didn't provide any room for the movie. But it can still provide what makes the franchise enjoyable thanks to stunning action scenes, some enjoyable throwback to some of the characters from the previous film on the third act, and animation that's as amazing as ever. Maybe fans of the franchise may enjoy this, but I don't think you should keep your expectations high since there will be instances from this where you may probably feel the franchise wouldn't be the same without. It feels that the movie doesn't have much awesomeness as the first three were, this one was just decent.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Can't say that I remember the second movie's plot also, but the main idea is pretty rememberable. Po against all odds and then he prevails and manages to save the day and make us laugh, with a little bit help with Jack Black's voice.This time his nemesis (voice of Viola Davis) is a little bit less powerful then the regular and his team doesn't get any screen time. Awkwafina, on the other hand, gets a lot of runtime and once again is dubbing a second character in an animated movie, until we are starting to get suspicious about what she has on Hollywood producers, that she keeps on getting so many parts on so many movies.We get a side quest of Po's dads and a body-learning quest of Po and a new character, which is taking place in the big city, not such as the small village plot, we got until now. It's a short runtime movie, with a tight plot and less characters, though some of the regulars still get their small part.It's a quest of going to the next level of the main character, which is demonstrating that growing up and learning never stops or getting old and you've got to move forward, even if you are doing the coolest job that you can possibly think about doing until the rest of your life.And when you need to pass the torch and let go, it is definitely the time to let go and use as a consultant. Maybe the DreamWorks team can start thinking about fresh ideas that doesn't involve Kung Fu, Panda bear and same story line, with a slightly different story. It was a fun ride of 15 years, but it is the time to move along and forward to something new and exciting.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The third movie ended on pretty good note there wasn't any need of a 4th movie.But I wasn't surprise because this is well on franchise which can bring millions of dollars and Hollywood try to squeeze every drop out of franchise until they can't squeeze no more.And Po doesn't need choose another dragon warrior because he is doing fine he's young I don't know who's idea was this because it's pretty terrible even if the wanted to make another sequel they should of made about another one of panda adventures with his buddies.That fox and chameleon might be worst character design and characters in the franchise they brought nothing new to the table. Again another female character who already knows everything she is at the same level as the dragon warrior she doesn't need any training she shown as pretty perfect character from the start. We love panda because of his flaws he has to train hard from the first movie and he defeated his enemies even when he was at disadvantage.And then there is disrespect towards previous villians Kai defeated master oogway the strongest character in the franchise but didn't even get one scene in the movie.Chameleon was just disappointing character against every other previous villians don't have to say much about her.Also the furious five was missing from the movie which I don't understand and got replaced by Po's dad's and fox. This didn't felt like Kung fu panda movie to me.If the really wanted to make a new apprentice than it should've been either tigress or Tai lung. They were ready at that time but they improved and learned from their mistakes.I don't like giving this movie such a low score but it was pretty bad 3/10 at Max.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Disliked how un-utilized some very important characters were, and the new fox character was underwhelming and bland, along with the villain, who lacked the depth of the other antagonists of Kung Fu Panda. This movie was obviously catered to a younger audience, and did not hold against the last movies. I really wished I had just waited for it to stream instead of seeing it in theaters. It had an interesting premise, but it felt rushed and bland. The lack of the furious five really irritated me, and Tai Lung and especially other villains felt out of character and unused. Very disappointed.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Her voice is extremely grating, and she has the range of a shallow puddle.The movie itself is boring and cliche, full of meaningless scenes that lack heart and cohesiveness. Here's an example: In the first movie, Po was not good at kung fu, and only dreamed of it. Both himself and his teacher had to get over their preconceptions in order to train him to be the dragon warrior, complete with an emotional montage to show how much they have grown.In this movie, the fox played by Awkwafina is a master kung fu artist because...well just because, okay? She never trained, she has no morals, and she tries to steal and cheat constantly. She even embarrassed Po at kung fu instantly as soon as she met him because...well just because, okay? She doesn't need a reason, even though Po has had three movies to grow and master his fighting, shes just better because...she just is.There is no moral lesson to be had here in this movie, no real character growth, and no engaging plot lines. Its just lame joke after joke, while the two main characters wander around with no real sense of urgency or threat. This movie is exhausting to watch.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The backup(criminals) wasn't as what I wanted to see which is the furious 5 who could've helped po more a lot than them all combined . The movie was good but was little too short for me I know its animation but probably it's bcs there was too many villains and probably couldn't had all the voice actor to be in this movie cause it would take loo tong too finish but I also think the po's villain should've fight for revenge on po but again it would take too long too finish. No oogway, few second of the furious five, po really was just being a panda in this movie. A lot of life lesson we can take from this movie. Chameleon in my opinion is not buff or strong as the other po's villains, she just take thier powers with her magic but still can't beat po bcs she wasn't mastered any kung fu since getting rejected from being into training in the jed Palace. The henchmens is same as her, so so so weak, the wolf gang in the second movie was much stronger in my opinion but the rest is ok lah for me. Just not the ending I hoped for but its ok as long I'm happy too see tai lung fight against the henchmens I'm good so yeah now the trilogy is over. Def a Goat trilogy along other Goat trilogies and it proves there hasn't been a bad movie yet in this franchise.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

It is enjoyable, and the visuals are absolutely amazing, but the ridiculous parts and scenes, which made Kung Fu Panda so appealing till now, even for adults, was very lackluster and pale. The jokes were far and in-between, thus making this 4th edition the flattest of them all. In fact I was the only one in the cinema who giggled 4 or 5 times. And there was silence in the rest of the hall. Unfortunately the director put too much weight on the fighting scenes and way too little on humor.

Unfortunately this was made by directors who are responsible for movies like ""Raya: The last dragon"" and ""Shrek: Forever after"" AND none of them has anything to do with previous movies of Kung fu Panda. This movie is predictable and boring. There is no plot twist, no surprise and voice actor Awkwafina is terrible, life-less and tedious as one mediocre voice actor can be. I hate her for many reasons and this movie just proved my point. There are minimum moments which are somehow entertaining or memorable but in general this was really excruciating to sit through the whole movie. With previous 3 movies I got the sense how creators grow up and evolve with their targeted audience. In a cinema there were more people who were in their twenties and thirties without children than I expected and it makes sense, since first movie has been released in 2008. This latest movie doesn't get the ""legacy"" which was logically supposed to follow. I am so disappointed, it should have ended with the third movie, not this trash. However I am sure modern kids will like it.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

But sadly and unfortunately it was just a money grabbing and milking opportunity for its makers. Nothing seemed like that I was watching a film from the kung fu panda franchise. The characters, the environment of that china taste, their culture and vibes all of that was missing and especially this wasn't a film on our PO. No character development for him and his companions it was the same po that we left in the KFP3. I mean each part was special because it showed us how he developed into a better version of himself. But here he was just that same old po with less humor and more unnecessary action part.They put this out just to seek a quick money grabbing opportunity for the production house.So thats it, I hope if they make a 5th part of the franchise they don't ruin it as they did to this one.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Zhen is the only likeable character in this, too bad her succession ark is badly exploited. I was in the theatre alone: at least no one could see the pain in my face. The most ""powerful"" scenes are blatantly stealed from Kung Fu Panda 1, especially the goose advice scene. There are cool editing techniques but there're clearly not enough to save this shipwreck. Lastly, Tai Lung's return is what I'd define a full-house mockery: it speaks three lines and is gone, nonetheless the trailer pumped up the audience for its return like no tomorrow.Overall, a waste of time and money and absolutely excruciating.

The 3rd movie felt like a nice wrap-up for the series. However, modern movie studios just can't give up on milking a franchise. Now we have a 4th entry in the series. Is this movie justified, or is it just another cash grab?Jack Black is still great as Po. He still hasn't lost his charm and continues to deliver a hilarious and charismatic, vocal performance. I also love that his character Po is still a badass dragon warrior. He is always the most skilled fighter in the room and I am glad they didn't make him weaker for the sake of it. Awkwafina is again voicing another sidekick character. She is fine but that is mostly because her character isn't written to be unbearable and that makes Awkwafina bearable. Their characters do have a fun buddy dynamic throughout. Speaking of buddy dynamics, it was nice to see James Hong and Bryan Cranston return as Ping the Geese and Shan the Panda again. Po's fathers have their own, fun mini-adventure in the movie.The animation is beautiful. Not to the extent of other dreamwork animated movies such as How to Train Your Dragon or Puss in Boots: The Last Wish. However, it looks very appealing for the most part. The action scenes are still very entertaining with its well choreographed Kung-fu scenes. It was also nice to see Ian McShane return as Tai Lung even though it was clearly done for nostalgia bait.Unfortunately, the story is predictable and boring. Po is required by Master Shifu to pick the next Dragon Warrior but Po doesn't want to and wants to remain the Dragon Warrior. This idea in itself, can be very interesting as he could potentially have to choose between his friends, The Furious Five. Sadly, they are not even in this movie so instead we get a new character in Zhen played by Awkwafina. Oh wow, I wonder who Po will pick...Po and his dynamic with The Furious Five have always been a highlight but removing that, makes this less interesting. The villain, The Chameleon, is also extremely underwhelming. She can steal the Kung-Fu of martial artists, including previous movie villains. Her motives are weak and her presence is just not menacing enough. They try to say throughout that Po might finally meet his match but they don't do a good job of convincing us that this is true. If anything, the big final battle feels like the easiest fight that Po has ever had so far. How is The Chameleon a threat if the Furious Five weren't even needed?! Ke Huy Quan is also in the movie but his character has no depth at all so it feels like a glorified cameo. Additionally, many of the jokes didn't land. I hate that they leave awkward pauses cause they clearly thought we the audience would laugh.Overall, this 4th movie had no reason to exist. The story is not meaningful enough to justify its existence. This will be the start of the second trilogy but the ending itself doesn't do much to make me interested in more. The ending is a fine ending to wrap up the series (again). Hopefully, the 5th entry is a lot better and this time, make sure The Furious Five are actually in the movie!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Honestly I'm kind of surprised at the more mixed reaction this seems to be getting compared to the rest of the franchise.This definitely feels like it's more content to have a fun ride than have a meaningful message compared to the other films but it succeeds at the latter to a degree that it didn't bother me that much. The animation is gorgeous, I think that's something we take for granted too much nowadays, especially given the smaller budget and I also thought it was really creative visually. It's consistently very funny and yes it might be childish humour but I don't know what else I'd expect from this kind of movie. Jack Black is effortlessly watchable (listenable?), Awkwafina is proving to be a perfect comedic sidekick not to mention James Hong and Bryan Cranston who have a surprisingly fun subplot. I didn't really care much for the villain this time round, a bit of a waste of Viola Davis if I'm being honest, and I did think the climax could've been stronger but those are most of the things holding it back for me.I knew exactly what I wanted from Kung Fu Panda 4 and it pretty much gave me want I was hoping for. It's not particularly deep, compared to the standard set by the other movies that is, but it's still a very enjoyable ride. I doesn't reach the heights of the second film for me but this is a really solid entry in a surprisingly reliable franchise.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Master Shifu suggests Po that it is time to select his successor and get promoted as a spiritual leader but Po doesn't want to give up on being the Dragon Warrior. A fox bandit named Zhen tries to steal ancient weapons at Jade Palace and Po stops her. As per her information, Po goes on a mission to stop a Chameleon at Juniper City after knowing she is a shape-shifting sorcerer wanting to steal the Kung-Fu techniques. How does Po stop her and will he be able to find his successor, forms rest of the story.Without the Furious Five, somehow this straight forward good vs evil story doesn't elevate itself above it's predictable screenplay. Jack Black as Po tries to entertain along with Awkwafina as Zhen. Some of the humor does work but the rest come out as generic. That extra fun element from the last 3 films is missing here, despite the threat from the villain being established well. The reason for Po being asked to give up his duty as Dragon Warrior by Master Shifu is not justified. Also, much effort should've been put in presenting Zhen apart from the basic character arc. Visually too the film doesn't stand out like it's predecessors and without the Furious Five, the action too appear repetitive. I am still going with a lenient rating because of the voice cast and couple of new characters who didn't get their due. If another sequel is made, I hope the makers concentrate more on the writing.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

But yet I am yet to see many people praise it, so I chose to do so!Most complaints I see are about the villain, not having a proper back story, and no furious 5, but I don't think people realise the furious 5 have never been the focus in Kung Fu PANDA, it's even in the title, and the enemies have never been good!Tai Long was only evil because, he got denied dragon warrior as Oogway saw darkness in him, but he would have never been evil in the first place, even this fourth film, proved that, with his final words to Po.Lord Shen was IMO the best, but his efforts was pointless by the third film, as they brang the pandas back.And also he was only evil due to a prophecy, which if he was never told he'd likely would never have been evil!!Kai I think was a decent villain tbf, no complaints whatsoever, but at the same time he wasn't very memorable!And now we have the Chameleon. Who grew up on the streets wanting to learn Kung Fu but couldn't because she was regarded as too small, let me just point out some things that proves she was a good villain, I know Mantis exists, but she grew up on the streets, in a city that didn't even know of the dragon warrior or the Furious 5, so in her city of course kung fu wouldn't be taught to her!And even so the focus was never for the enemy, it was for the new dragon warrior, who had a really good story I reckon, this fourth film is clearly to progress the story, to the next step!I really do think this was a good movie!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was funny heartwarming and some good ole kung fu action.

But while reaching the very end, i don't know why i wasn't surprised not to hear a single word of them. Even the AI can see the reason behind the failure of this movie and why not bringing those 5 main characters ""manage the budget by not having to bring back the big-name actors for huge roles."" and reading the reviews that highlight some interesting facts makes me realize how right that was.For second i couldn't believe they might ruin such masterpiece for money, especially when they themselves were surprised by the success of the first two season. And the amount of revenue that they couldn't never dream about. But i guess we all can be wrong.Let's get back to season one, it didn't have glories VE. It won't be exaggerated if i said there were barley any in compare with new one. It was very basic, yet the crowd was overwhelmed, did the director or even the writer ever asked themselves why? Bringing back all those old characters yet missing the main important one is like spitting in the face of the audience, i mean please next time call it Kungfu panda but with the absent of PO too. How about that? Or Kungfu panda and make it a documentary about Jodo.It used to be Kungfu panda despite the Dragon Warrior being the core of it, but it wasn't really that simple, because we found out the Panada being good at Kung Fu (and everything else) was the main story, however since season three at least, the whole idea was shifted, even the creator fails to see what they were once thinking about. Even while they bring nostalgia back.You know what? You killed this franchise twice already it is enough, let it die in peace and go the next realm, you brought it back just like Chamilion did with all those warriors. The funny thing is you made the same mistake Shifu did in the first movie, but he learned his mistake eventually, you made a movie you didn't believe in it in the first place but for the sake of risk you give it a go with small budget and huge VE. While this movie itself speaks to you when it says, ""it's what's within that count"". Now thinking of it, i really feel the producers and all those behind this work was represented in the Chameleon while we the audience were PO and we were taking as PO was Characterize in this movie.I would have like it if it was only a table with the six main character speaking in a journalist event.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

As a young artist myself, this movie was more than the fourth movie in the franchise, it was for the fans, made with so much love and care with lots of hardwork. This movie was not so easy to make, and so what I'm saying is that we should appreciate animators, storytellers and musicians even more than we do, because without the art majoring students, there wouldn't be any creativity or something that reunites us for laughs and good times.

Dialogue exchanges are cringeworthy, resembling poorly written soap opera scripts from the '80s. Not to mention the egregious overuse of clichés that would make even the most forgiving viewer roll their eyes in disbelief.As if the lackluster storyline wasn't enough, the film's pacing is akin to watching paint dry on a rainy day. Scenes drag on for what feels like an eternity, leaving audiences desperately yearning for the end credits to roll and put them out of their misery.Even the production value falls flat, with laughably cheap special effects that wouldn't pass muster in a high school student film project. It's as if the filmmakers raided a bargain bin for their visual effects budget and called it a day.In the end, 'Unnecessary Chronicles' is an insult to the art of filmmaking and a waste of precious time and resources.

Or was this a strange attempt to make Kung Fu Panda relevant for today's audiences? Regardless the cast was wrong and without the 5 it didn't feel like Kung Fu panda, it felt like one of those weird spin offs they make at Christmas.They could have done so much more with this movie, they could have created a bad guy in the shadow realm, they could have reused Tai Lung or a corrupted master Oogway, they could have made the main protagonist even better but evidently they cashed in and marketed the hell out of it.A real shame as I think that's it for the magic of Kung Fu Panda, if they make more...they've already made their bed with the latest and weakest addition.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A worthy fourth entry in this popular martial arts series that exudes the signature charm of its predecessors","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9792208/?ref_=tt_urv","MrDHWong","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18374284/?ref_=tt_urv","16 May 2024","""Kung Fu Panda 4"" is the sequel to 2016's ""Kung Fu Panda 3"" and the fourth installment in the ""Kung Fu Panda"" franchise. Directed by Mike Mitchell (""Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo"", ""Sky High"", ""Trolls"") and featuring the voices of Jack Black, Awkwafina, and Viola Davis, it is a worthy fourth entry in this popular martial arts series that exudes the signature charm of its predecessors.In the Valley of Peace, Po (voiced by Jack Black) is enjoying his life as the ""Dragon Warrior"" while also helping out his adoptive father Mr. Ping (voiced by James Hong) and biological father Li Shan (voiced by Bryan Cranston) with running their restaurant. One day, Master Shifu (voiced by Dustin Hoffman) informs Po that he must choose a suitable successor to take over as he is due to retire to become the Valley's next spiritual leader. Meanwhile, an evil shapeshifting sorceress known as ""The Chameleon"" (voiced by Viola Davis) vows to summon all of Po's previous adversaries to absorb their kung fu powers and use them for her own sinister needs. As Po struggles to find a new beneficiary, he decides to postpone his decision making to team up with a cunning fox thief named Zhen (voiced by Awkwafina) to stop the Chameleon from achieving her goal of ruling all of China.Since beginning all the way back in 2008, DreamWorks Animation's ""Kung Fu Panda"" series has gone on to become one of its most popular franchises, grossing more than $2 billion at the box office. In addition to its humour and action sequences, the series also owes a great deal of its success to the respectful, well-researched depiction of Chinese culture shown throughout each of its films. In fact, the first film was so successful in this regard that it even caused a national debate in China over why a Western animation studio could make a better film about their culture than they have ever done up to that point. Now sixteen years after its debut, the franchise now welcomes a fourth film to the series with ""Kung Fu Panda 4"", which still contains most of the same fun you'd expect with a few other surprises along the way.Much like the previous sequels, this one shows us how much Po has matured since becoming the revered ""Dragon Warrior"" in the first film. As the story begins, we watch Po effortlessly fight a large stingray terrorising a seaside community before heading back home for his duties at the restaurant operated by both of his fathers. No longer viewed as a clumsy buffoon by others, Po is now highly respected among the local citizens of the Valley of Peace, so much so that he has numerous admirers lining up to meet him. Though he has now stepped up in the world, Po has never lost sight of his roots, remaining true to both himself and to those who have cared about him from the very start.However, Po's time in the spotlight is set to end soon after Master Shifu informs him that he must stand down in favour of an inevitable successor taking his place. Of course, Po does not want to leave his heroic position and shows his childish side once again by making a comedic display of choosing himself over the potential candidates lined up before him. This leads to Po having a brief but deep discussion with Master Shifu on making important decisions about life whenever the opportunity presents itself. Po then tries his hardest to meditate on what he has learned but finds it difficult due to him becoming distracted by his own stomach. It's interesting to watch Po attempt to balance his fun-loving instincts with his adopted warrior persona, as it shows the growth in his character over the course of the preceding films.Another thing that the ""Kung Fu Panda"" films can attest to is the impressive visuals. Even after more than a decade, the older films still contain some rather beautifully shot scenes that make this world of the Valley of Peace look straight out of an ancient Chinese artwork. This film shows how much technology has advanced since then, showcasing the sweeping landscapes of certain locations like the mountains covered in mist or the peach tree surrounded by pink blossoms blowing in the wind. Each place looks like it has some kind of history behind it, even a seemingly cliched bar full of criminals that only serves the purpose of setting up an obligatory action scene.But it's not just the locations that look nice, it's also the characters themselves. I couldn't help but notice the attention-to-detail paid to the fur on Po's body, especially when he is fighting against his enemies. The way the strands of hair flicker about and how the light shines off them looks more real this time, which is even more noticeable after rewatching the other three films leading up to this one. With that said, this is easily the best-looking film in the series so far, and things can only get better from here on out.As mentioned above, the evolution of Po's character is part of the main appeal of the entire franchise, and it is primarily thanks to Jack Black's loveable performance in the role. Black has always excelled at playing characters who are funny but are still able to be taken seriously if the situation calls for it, which is a trait that fits Po perfectly. You can't help but want Po to succeed at what he wants in life, even if that means reluctantly stepping outside of his comfort zone. To my surprise, this film appears to have toned down the usual fat jokes and slapstick humour in favour of comedy more focused around Po's banter with his new travelling partner Zhen.On that note, Awkwafina is a nice addition to the cast as Zhen and her chemistry with Jack Black is solid. It would appear that Awkwafina is certainly making a name for herself in the world of voice acting, as this is yet another project that uses her unique voice to the film's advantage. At first, I expected Zhen to be another one of those generic sidekick characters added for the sake of moving the story along, but she actually manages to stand out on her own terms. Zhen has worked her way up from the bottom, developing street smarts and a sassy attitude that makes her the ideal type of character to play off someone like Po. I enjoyed watching Zhen and Po interact with each other, and the two also make a fine fighting duo together.It's also fun to watch Po's two fathers Ping and Shan work alongside one another, with the pair often finding themselves in some humorous situations. Anyone who watched the third film will remember that these two did not like each other at first due to them conflicting over who was Po's real father, but here they have since buried the hatchet and learned to collaborate on certain projects together, like running the restaurant for the locals. Like Jack Black and Awkwafina, James Hong and Bryan Cranston have a nice comedic dynamic playing off each other's conflicting views, which adds some emotional weight to how much they care about Po in the long run. I wouldn't mind seeing a spin-off focusing around the two of them, as the potential is definitely there.In the villainous role, Viola Davis is clearly enjoying herself as the Chameleon, a powerful sorceress with the power to shape-shift. She feels like more of a threat than most of the other villains in the previous three films, especially considering how she is able to change into either of them whenever she pleases. Without giving away too much, the Chameleon's backstory was interesting in the way it parallels with both Zhen and Po. Davis plays into the Chameleon's most sinister traits, making her the most dangerous enemy Po has had to face since becoming the ""Dragon Warrior"".Now four entries in, the ""Kung Fu Panda"" franchise may not be breaking much new ground in terms of storytelling, but this film is still just as fun as the ones preceding it. There's enough humour, action, and nice visual eye candy to hold one's attention for its short 93 minute runtime, which is more than can be said for most other family-oriented entertainment released nowadays. According to some research, this film is meant to be the start of a new trilogy, and there is certainly room for more enjoyable antics from Po and the other characters in the not-to-distant future. So long as all of the cast members are able to return, I'm curious to see what happens next.I rate it 7.5/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

A well-crafted backstory provides insight into the character's motivations, struggles, and ultimately, what drives them to become the antagonist. It allows viewers to empathize with their journey, even if they disagree with their actions.In the case of the Chameleon there's a missed opportunity to delve into her past and explore what led her down the path of villainy. Perhaps she started as a humble reptile living in the shadowy depths of the Forbidden City, unnoticed and unappreciated by the other inhabitants. Over time, feelings of resentment and envy festered within her as she witnessed the fame and glory bestowed upon the skilled martial artists?Driven by a desire for recognition and power, the Chameleon could have embarked on a quest to master the ancient arts of kung fu, only to find herself continually overlooked and underestimated by her peers. Each rejection fueling his bitterness and fueling his thirst for revenge against those he perceives as his tormentors. Alternatively, her backstory could explore themes of betrayal and deception.Just stating she wanted to learn kung fu and no one taught her made her want power does not cut it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Like the previous 3 movies before this one, Kung Fu Panda 4 features a stellar cast lead by the awesomely funny Jack Black. Dustin Hoffman, Bryan Cranston, and Ian McShane all reprise their roles from earlier installments and are joined by franchise newcomers Awkwafina, Ke Huy Quan, and Viola Davis. The film is also directed by Mike Mitchell who is responsible for such hit films as Sky High, Shrek Forever After, and Trolls.When I heard that this movie was being made I was both very excited and very nervous. I am a huge fan of this franchise and loved the first three movies so I was excited that it was getting another installment. On the other hand, however, I was very nervous because I did not want them to ruin the franchise by not letting it end. There are many, many franchises that have been ruined because the producers just could not let it die. One example that I can think of this happening to is the The Walking Dead franchise (seven different TV series' and counting with movies on the way). I loved the original series and admittedly have watched and enjoyed most of the shows that have come after it, but at what point will it end? It needs to end!Anyhow, back to the subject of this blog. I am very happy to say that the Kung Fu Panda franchise is far from ruined. Kung Fu Panda 4 takes you back to the Valley of Peace where we find Po struggling with the knowledge that he cannot remain the Dragon Warrior forever and, he is also challenged by a shapeshifting Chameleon (Davis) who is hell bent on being the greatest master of kung fu ever, no matter the cost. This movie has everything; suspense, laughs, (another) awesome villain, and even some lessons are learned along the way. Not to mention a rendition of Britney Spears' "".... Baby One More Time"" performed by Tenacious D that can only be described as AWESOME!I absolutely loved this movie and I hope you do too. Skadoosh!","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's usually to be expected for movies to depreciate in quality as new sequels are released and that's what this felt like. The story was mostly forgettable and not as in depth as I would've wanted. However in its defense, kung fu panda is directed mainly towards a younger audience. I personally think there's just nothing about this movie that makes it better than any of its predecessors.However I do think there is a good message in the movie and I like how there's moments where the antagonists and heroes are contrasted directly. For example there was a scene in the film where Mr ping explained to po how change was a good thing while the antagonist was explaining how it was bad in the scene directly after. I like these kind of inclusions in movies like this because it shows the difference in motive and develops character. I also enjoyed Tai Lungs parts, in which I thought he had good lines. Otherwise this movie had some average action scenes and sequences throughout, nothing crazy. I don't think this installment was necessary in the kung fu panda series but it's not trash either.

Title: Disappointing Sequel: A Critical Analysis of Kung Fu Panda 4Introduction:
Kung Fu Panda 4, the latest installment in the beloved animated franchise, was met with much anticipation and excitement. As a fan of the previous films, I eagerly awaited the continuation of Po's journey as the Dragon Warrior. However, upon viewing the film, I couldn't help but feel a sense of disappointment. In this critical analysis, I will delve into the reasons why Kung Fu Panda 4 failed to live up to its predecessors and why it ultimately fell short of expectations.Plot Recycled and Predictable:
One of the major drawbacks of Kung Fu Panda 4 is its recycled and predictable plot. Unlike the previous films, which introduced fresh and engaging storylines, this installment felt like a mere rehash of familiar themes. The narrative lacked innovation and failed to offer any surprises or twists that could captivate the audience. Instead, it followed a formulaic structure that felt tired and uninspired. As a result, the plotline failed to hold my interest and left me feeling disengaged from the film's narrative arc.Forced Humor:
Another notable flaw of Kung Fu Panda 4 was its reliance on forced humor. While the earlier films seamlessly blended witty jokes with heartfelt moments, this sequel seemed to prioritize cheap laughs over genuine humor. The jokes felt contrived and often fell flat, relying on slapstick comedy and juvenile gags rather than clever wit. As a fan of the series, I found myself cringing at the attempts at humor, which seemed out of place and disconnected from the overall tone of the film. Instead of eliciting genuine laughter, these forced attempts at comedy only served to detract from the viewing experience.Stagnant Character Development:
In addition to its lackluster plot and forced humor, Kung Fu Panda 4 also suffered from stagnant character development. One of the strengths of the previous films was their focus on the growth and evolution of the characters, particularly Po. However, in this installment, the characters seemed to remain static, with little to no development or depth. Po, in particular, felt like a caricature of himself, lacking the emotional depth and complexity that made him such a compelling protagonist in the earlier films. Without meaningful character development, I found it difficult to invest in the fates of the characters or become emotionally invested in their journey.Forgettable Addition to the Franchise:
Overall, Kung Fu Panda 4 can be best described as a forgettable addition to the franchise. Unlike its predecessors, which left a lasting impact on audiences with their memorable characters, engaging storylines, and heartfelt messages, this sequel failed to leave a lasting impression. Instead of building upon the strengths of the previous films, it fell short in almost every aspect, from its recycled plot to its forced humor and stagnant character development. As a fan of the series, it pains me to say that Kung Fu Panda 4 missed the mark and failed to recapture the magic that made the earlier films so beloved.Conclusion:
In conclusion, Kung Fu Panda 4 failed to live up to its predecessors and ultimately proved to be a disappointing addition to the franchise. With its recycled plot, forced humor, and stagnant character development, the film fell short of expectations and failed to capture the charm and wit that made the earlier films so memorable. While it's always difficult to see a beloved series falter, I can only hope that future installments will learn from the mistakes of Kung Fu Panda 4 and return to the high standards set by the original film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

We had a great time and I do not understand the people's expectations after seeing the rewiews. It deserves at least a 7 in my case an 8. Also the soundtrack which has rock cover of Britney song oops I did it again is also an enjoyable version. For kids and adults I do recommend Kung Fu Panda 4 for an enjoyable time.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

However, the film falls short in several key areas. The voice acting lacks the depth and nuance of previous installments, detracting from the overall experience. Moreover, the storyline is highly predictable, lacking the innovative twists fans have come to expect from the franchise. Disappointingly, it also omits the crucial development of Po becoming a 'spiritual leader,' a significant narrative arc anticipated by many. Despite the stunning picture quality, these shortcomings render ""Kung Fu Panda 4"" a rather forgettable chapter in the series. Its failure to deliver on both character development and plot innovation makes watching it feel like a missed opportunity and, frankly, a waste of time for loyal fans and newcomers alike.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I have always been a huge fan of the Kung Fu Panda series. For me, Po is the absolute star every time he returns, but it's their past villains that really stick with me. The new villain is an interesting character, but she doesn't have enough background information to resonate with the audience and keeps making illogical decisions. There's no real climax, as the theme is vague and it feels like little more than entertainment. The stereotype structure is clearly laid out before the audience (becoming hero-lesson). DreamWorks tries so hard to maintain this structure that it feels like they don't care about how the audience actually feels. They had all the pieces, but the pieces didn't come together in the right way to tell the right story. The animation is okay, and some of the lines are funny and meaningful as usual, but everything feels too contrived. A good family movie for kids, Po is entertaining as usual. Don't watch 3D.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie introduces a character, Zhen, in which we may meet in the next two movies. The antagonist, The Chameleon, didn't really have anything going on except than bringing past antagonists (Tai Lung, Lord Shen, General Kai) back. The execution of the antagonist could have been way better and her backstory doesn't really look well written compared to the rest of past antagonists. In my opinion though, I feel like the second half of the movie was better than the first half but that's just what I believe. The action and music met my expectations. Most of the jokes were quite funny. Although the plot of the movie could definitely improve, there seems to be a lot of ideas as to how this movie could have been better such as including Shifu more. In comparison to the other movies in the Kung Fu Panda franchise, I could see this as better, worse, or even the same level as Kung Fu Panda 3 depending on how you see it. You might think this movie is great because it brings new characters to the master trilogy (KFP 4,5,6). You might think this movie was bad because it wasn't exactly the same as the student trilogy (KFP 1,2,3). Anyway, I believe you should watch the movie because it introduces Zhen and their bonding relationship with Po for the next two upcoming movies (in which 6 total movies were planned since 2010). Hopefully the writing for the upcoming Kung Fu Panda movies will be better than Kung Fu Panda 4.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Kung Fu Panda 1 and Kung Fu Panda 3 were my favourite. They all had emotional touch. Kung Fu Panda 4 also has a message but it is very small. The writing couldn't convince me in any emotional way. The only time I get emotional was when Tai Long appeared because it's nostalgic for me and I'm a fan of Tai Long, say whatever you want to say, I'm a fan of Tai Long, it's not a spoiler because he's clearly shown in the trailer. I hope this franchise never ends. I want the same good old feelings with upcoming Kung Fu Panda movies. In King Fu Panda 4, I hate one thing and it's cinematography. Like what happened to the classic makers? The picture was so dark in terms of lights that it's hard to watch it even after using a torch. It's a small story, they just expanded it. In my personal opinion, whoever decided to make a film on this story, was a bad idea because this could have been done in some kind of web series or something because the story is not worth showing in big screen. And it's just my personal opinion. Justice was not done with the characters of Furious Five. They are my favourite characters too. I have a message for the makers. See, not everybody has time to watch the web series or something like that. In the next movie, please take your time and write something big. You know, it's not about the action always, it's about the story, it's about the emotion, it's about the message. Kung Fu Panda 4 couldn't deliver it. It's just one bad film, I will not say bad, but it ranks third in my list of favourite Kung Fu Panda films. If you make hundred Kung Fu Panda films, I will still watch it. But please work on the writing for the next film. I wasn't disappointed by this film Kung Fu Panda 4 but the story is very small, they just expanded it and made it longer. For that reason, I rate this 5 out of 10 or 2.5 out of 5.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

If you only keep the good parts of the movie and remove any extra unnecessary scene you get a 20 to 30 min medium movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Indeed, Dreamworks has all their chops in fine form throughout. But, no degree of production value can overcome a weak script that only offers ten percent value on the run time.This remake lacks the emotional depth and intrigue needed to carry through a 90 minute presentation.

It's not just a step back for the franchise; it's a full-on plunge into mediocrity. The charm, wit, and heart that defined earlier films are nowhere to be found, replaced by a threadbare script and lackluster visuals that suggest a much lower budget and a disheartening lack of effort.The plot is predictably dull, lacking any of the inventive twists or emotional depth that once captivated audiences of all ages. Where previous entries in the series were bolstered by exhilarating music and stunning cinematography, this installment feels utterly uninspired. The sound effects were forgettable at best, and the visual flair that animated the earlier films has dimmed to a mere flicker.As a fan of the ""Kung Fu Panda"" series, I was left not only disappointed but genuinely saddened by this film. It felt like a hollow echo of what once was-a franchise that had skillfully balanced humor, action, and poignant moments now reduced to a mere shadow of its former glory. Watching ""Kung Fu Panda 4"" was an unequivocally disheartening experience, leaving me to mourn what could have been a vibrant continuation of a beloved saga but instead ended up as a dismal, time-wasting affair. DreamWorks and the creative team behind this project have not only let down their audience but have also done a disservice to the characters and movies we've grown to love.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The fourth installment, Kung Fu Panda 4, introduces Po, a character who is a martial arts master, and his mentor Master Shifu, who tells him a new Dragon Warrior must take his place. Po sets off on a mission with a companion who sells him short to fight a villain with a more terrifying skill set. The skeptical ally is a shifty fox thief named Zhen, who Po strikes a deal with to track down a ""empress of disguise"" who aims to acquire kung-fu expertise through magic and trickery. Zhen is meant to blur the lines between good and bad, but by the end, all the good guys are on the same side, so this moral ""blurring"" only lasts for so long. The franchise continues to improve with each installment, showcasing the power of emotion, animation, and character development in children's movies. ""Kung Fu Panda 4"" is a new installment in the popular animated series, featuring the beloved hero Po at a career crossroads. Po is being asked to give up his dream role as Dragon Warrior and pick a successor, but he still has an imposter syndrome that makes change frightening. The series introduces a new enemy, The Chameleon, who threatens Po's existence. Po teams up with a Corsac fox named Zhen, who is an orphan-turned-thief and teaches the panda not to trust anyone. The film also introduces the Furious Five, Tigress, Viper, Monkey, Crane, and Mantis, who have been in each ""Kung Fu Panda"" iteration so far. The Chameleon and her Komodo dragon guards provide a visual break for viewers, while sometimes dipping into different animation styles. Some missteps include a pelican character controlled by a fish in its mouth and three cute bunnies who appear adorable yet are deeply psychotic. Despite these missteps, the filmmakers manage to pave the way for a new franchise direction, find new ways to entertain us, remind us of lessons like ""It's never too late to do the right thing,"" and end the movie with a Black-led cover of Britney Spears' ""...Baby One More Time."" The film offers a memorable goodbye and a glimpse into the future of the franchise, offering valuable lessons for other filmmakers to learn from. Mike Mitchell, a seasoned animation director, is stepping into the Kung Fu Panda universe for the first time, aiming to lead the series in a new direction. The movie, which follows the conclusion of the trilogy, has a deliberate focus on succession and moving on. While some parts feel like fanfiction, the film never attempts to force viewers to return to the previous films. Kung Fu Panda 4, the latest installment in DreamWorks' underrated movie series, follows Dragon Warrior Po as he faces the challenge of passing the torch to a new martial arts master while dealing with the threat of The Chameleon, a shapeshifting sorceress attempting to steal his kung fu mastery. Despite some missing or altered elements from previous films, the film features new additions and expertly choreographed fight scenes, making it another worthy entry into the series.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

But of course, any beloved franchise with box office potential can never be left behind in Hollywood. Kung Fu Panda 4 still carries the fun vibe of the first three instalments, but it also commits the mistake of cinematically replacing the Furious Five with a new character Zhen (voiced by Awkwafina). Budgetary concerns, by the looks of it? The film is budgeted at $85 million, as opposed to the $130-150 million of the prequels. I also read somewhere that the film was supposedly planned as a live action/animated hybrid at one point; wonder how that would've turned out. In the current version, the makers haven't tried anything unexpectedly new; they've stuck to the basics of what made the earlier instalments work.Anyhow, it's safe to say that sequel #4 isn't terrible. But it doesn't quite scale the heights of the previous three, even with a stronger antagonist (Viola Davis). Jack Black is still in fine form voicing Po, and the same can be said of some of the others like Dustin Hoffman, Bryan Cranston, James Hong, Ian McShane. Ke Huy Quan feels wasted. I especially loved the equation between Po's dads that led to some situationally funny moments. Po's persistent food obsession still finds the space for the occasional one-liner. The set-pieces offer some slick editing gimmicks which I've only seen in animes and martial-arts-based video games, but they aren't all that memorable, which is almost how I'd describe the movie altogether.P. S. Hans Zimmer's score is overshadowed by Tenacious D's rendering of ""Hit Me Baby One More Time"" during the end credits.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Generally colour was more subdued, which wasn't as effective.The movie was saved by the voice and fox character inhabited by Awkwafina. She was funny, petite and agile; plus acted as the perfect balance to Pandas huge bulk. Her feminine style touched subtlety on the theme of Panda's closeted asexual side in a clever way. The unspoken theme of Po's sexuality came very slightly to the foreground in an intriguing way.Awkwafina is still very underrated as the comedic genius she actually is. She is one of those people who are able to be hysterically funny without effort. This is the second time she's saved a movie from disaster: Nicholas Cage's ""Renfield"" was really her film.Her character also injects the adorable ""aw"" factor each time her little paws open.Po was his usual loveable self and appealing in his boyish innocence. His two male fathers provide another insight into the hidden soul of Po as they fuss over their beloved boy.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was so bad that I refuse to accept that It's canon. I was so excited for it yet, I regret watching it. There was no depth to the plot and the villain's purpose was nothing; If you compare it to Tai Lung, Lord Shen and Kai's story, it's insulting to the triology. The characters held no power and the story was so very rushed, such that it is completely obvious that this film was made just for the sake of a sequel. The animation style changes were so ridiculous that I will not make any further comments on those. Anti-climactic except for that one scene where we see a glimpse of the Po from the previous movies instead of him being presented like a joke. Just no. Don't watch it.

I'm a huge fan of hers but less is definitely more.The characters are good, story is a bit predictable as an adult but I don't think kids will see the twists coming as easily. The design is always stunning in these films, It was a curious choice to leave the 5 out but in this film it'd have made little sense paying those actors for a few lines.A great little addition however, with cinema prices reaching insane levels it's hard to think a family trip and food to watch this for £60 is really worth it, as a £10 dvd it's brilliant, I do think price can affect score massively, I have the subscription so see unlimited films for £11 a month.

However, I found myself occasionally distracted by my phone, which made me lose attention at times. Despite this, I managed to see most of the movie.The chameleon villain is particularly interesting with its shapeshifting abilities, and the twist involving the thief was well-executed, even if it was somewhat predictable. Tai Lung's return is amazing; his kung fu scenes are peak excitement, although his presence, unfortunately, doesn't last forever.In the second half, the Po vs. The thief rematch is intriguing, as it isn't a typical evil vs. Good battle but rather showcases a good gesture from the thief. The animations in these scenes are, once again, impressive, and the overall execution of the scene is solid.The highlight, however, is the ending fight. It is done so well-the direction, the movements, the animations-everything is fantastic. The Po vs. Evil Po scene is just wow, leaving a lasting impression with its intensity and visual brilliance. However, it feels like the villains were nerfed, which somewhat reduces the stakes.The scene where the villains bow down to Po in respect was good, though it felt a bit underwhelming. While the animation throughout the movie is fantastic, living up to the high standards set by the previous films in the series, this installment has its ups and downs.Overall, Kung Fu Panda 4 is a good movie, way better than people said, to be honest. It's even better than Part Two, which I gave a 7 out of 10. I'd rate this one a solid 7.5 out of 10.While the original trilogy felt sufficient, Kung Fu Panda 4 still adds something valuable. As you watch, you get the sense that the story being told is necessary, which justifies the continuation of the series, even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of its predecessors.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That might be true, but, that doesn't make it a bad film. As all the Kung Fu panda films, this one is also full of little dialogues that make you think about life, always trying to include the Chinese wisdom in a very easy way to understand and apply (even for the kids). In my opinion, that has much more value in a film than just some vain jokes. In this movie, Po has to understand that changes are good and common, not easy to accept but that's part of the life and sometimes we just need to move on in our life and share our knowledge and experience with others.A movie for kids doesn't that it has to be full of silly situations and laughs all the time. A good message to make us think in our life is enjoyable too. That's why I always prefer any Kung Fu Panda movie or even How to train your dragon instead something like Despicable me.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Pretty Good Fun But Not Quite Satisfying as a Kung Fu Panda Movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9711190/?ref_=tt_urv","Clank_Zoka","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur68925761/?ref_=tt_urv","31 March 2024","So... on Saturday I went to see the latest instalment in the Kung Fu Panda franchise ""Kung Fu Panda 4"", which features the returning voices of Jack Black, Dustin Hoffman, Bryan Cranston and James Hong, along with Viola Davis and Awkwafina as new characters in this film, so before I start my review of this film, I should probably go over what I thought of the other Kung Fu Panda films, I grew up watching them and I really like them a lot!, they are super funny, beautiful to look at, emotional, action packed and with solid music and wonderful characters and voice acting, with the exception of 3 just being mostly quite good, the first two movies are quite flawless in their own right and I like them a lot!, so now we got number 4, which is a make or break at this point and so the movie was released earlier in the month and I heard it was good but fans weren't too pleased, but that didn't stop me from being excited and seeing it, so I went to see it and..... sorry KFP fans, I really enjoyed it, I found it to be pretty good, easily EASILY the weakest film of the franchise but I still had a fairly good time despite a few flaws that hold back this film from being great so let's talk about it!Good things first off is the animation, it still looks just as spectacular as the previous films, still looking vibrant and stylised, it's not quite Puss in Boots 2 but it still remains the same looking animation but still fantastic and with new editions as huge standouts, the action and martial arts is creative and fun to watch as to be expected and the colours are certainly there!, the voice acting is once again top-notch, the characters we know and love are... no different but still their charming selves, the score by Hans Zimmer and Steve Mazzaro while not as good as the previous films' music is still nice and gets the energy going for the most part, the new characters weren't bad, I liked Zhan and the Chameleon they were decent characters that I enjoyed particularly from their vocal performances by Awkwafina and Viola Davis respectively, I did mainly chuckle and got a few laughs for the most part, it kept constant with the tone and energy for the most part, it was really nice to see these characters and this world again on the big screen after 8 years, it's lots of fun and I wasn't bored, I didn't checked my watch that much and I didn't wriggle about unlike a certain OTHER SEQUEL, it was a nice experience, maybe not as memorable as maybe the last movie but it was still good, it had a nice-ish conclusion that I did kind of like, plus the cover of ""Baby One More Time"" by Tenacious D is AWESOME!, absolutely love it!, they could do more covers because it's fantastic,However!, there are flaws and a lot of people seem to point out, well not sure if everyone else has 'em but for me it's very VERY predictable like even before watching, I knew exactly what was going to happen, it follows the same format beat for beat and it's not hard to see why it doesn't standout like the previous films, it reminded me more of Cars 3 than anything else (Seriously think about it), while Zhen is a decent character, it's just another Awkwafina character that's kinda no different from other characters she voiced, she was good don't get me wrong but I'd prefer if we had the Furious Five once more because that would make more sense and then Zhen could join them or something?, but nope they are completely gone which is a shame but hey I wasn't completely bothered by it, Po and the rest of the previous characters are still good but don't add anything new of substance just... themselves, the inclusion of Tai Lung is interesting, hell even Lord Shen and Kai could've been better established here but... they feel like.. fan service and nothing else... I mean it's kinda cool to see them again?, but they contribute to almost nothing and really feels like a cop-out, plus while most of the humour work for me about 20% perfect didn't land or wasn't funny enough, the previous films at least balanced, humour, drama and action out nicely, this one does leave out drama which is what makes these films so memorable and super strong, the villain the Chameleon is decent and has a cool design and the animation on her is spectacular, she's just another villain but unlike the previous three, she does not have much of a connection to Po other than taking forms of previous masters, she was decent but nothing more than that, the Dads are fine but they contribute to almost nothing and could've easily been back at the Valley of Peace than follow Po, but those are the flaws I had with the film.So despite how much of the film had quite a bit wrong going for it and how it could've been better established as a Kung Fu Panda movie with story, characters and conclusion could've been handled better, ""Kung Fu Panda 4"" is a pretty good, while yes it's the weakest of the films and less impactful, BUT.. I didn't mind it so much and I did have a fairly good time watching it, it has heart, humour (mostly), the great animation and characters we all know and love return and amazing music and action, everything else really doesn't come together as Kung Fu Panda movie and feels like they're doing it.. just because and cop-out at the very end with very not-so-special new characters I'll be honest, but just go in to have fun, even if you are a fan of Kung Fu Panda, just accept for what it is and I seen so much hatred for this film and even the director as well, I think it's a bit too far so chill out and just enjoy what you enjoy, maybe ignore the fourth film all together and stick with the first three?, I understand the disappointment and sharing so many opinions on it, but at the end of the day, it's gonna have it's fans so.. like what you like and let other people like what they like even if you don't like it, so yeah.... not a great movie but... pretty good, not sure the need for another film but maybe a series or short would make sense???, ehh skadoosh and all the rest of it, oh and by the way Mr. Beast cameo ruined the joke from Kung Fu Panda 3, if you know.., you know..I'm going to be generous and give ""Kung Fu Panda 4"" a 8.2/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I definitely think the first and second movie are better but I think it's tied with the third, but the movie does lack the deep meaning we've seen with the first 2 movies. I did believe that this movie would be disappointing when I saw awkwafina was casted and the furious five didn't have much of a role in it but it's really not as big a blowback as some people make it seem, I am as everyone else disappointed with the previous villians who I anticipated more from and they frankly behaved in ways I couldn't see them behaving in the movies they featured in, especially tai lung. Who I as everyone else believes done dirty, Overall this was a fun movie but not the best kung fu panda movie. It lacked the thought provoking element of the other movies, had its share of plot holes, and had awkwafina, and the main villian here is decent but not nearly as catchy as the first 3 we've seen, the plot definitely felt rushed especially regarding jen who I still barely know anything about but it didn't make the movie unwatchable. I believe the trilogy was perfect and this movie wasn't really necessary but I'll take it i guess.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was enjoyable. Also quite funny.It was pretty predictable, but hey, its a cartoon for kids.Plenty of action. Jack Black is great, as ever. Lots of other recognisable voices.The feeling on the way home seemed to be that this franchise has run its course and its time to end.Some interesting ideas in this, well executed. Had a good time and a laugh for 90 odd minutes - what more can one ask for?Not really much else to say but that silly char count.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But Po and his new fox sidekick Zhen have other news. They've teamed up to learn lessons about loyalty and take down the villainous Chameleon, who can rip the Kung Fu powers right out of your body, thanks to some kind of shadowy magic that... I think has something to do with an emerald staff? Honestly, it doesn't really matter. What matters is the sight gags, the actual gags, and the lightning fast stunts, and there's more of those here than a Jackie Chan marathon. The animation looks amazing with tons of visual effects and punchy cuts, and the voice cast nails it too - Awkwafina makes a great match with Jack Black and all the old regular voices. Even if *I* didn't fully get what was going on, the bunch of 6 and 9 year olds I took along were glued to the action. So line up KFP4 for the school holidays, if you've got kids you'd be a kung fool to miss it.@WatchItWombat.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Everything Po was, is and became through the last 3 movies started from 'Becoming the Dragon warrior', to 'Finding about his Past, his Heritage, His People, His Core..' was rather swiftly or otherwise substantially undone. Dreamworks should've stuck to their writing pads and should've concentrated on expanding the lore of the characters had been already introduced than diluting the universe of characters that were introduced in previous movies. (I'm saying this as an Movie-only watcher; I haven't verified whether the universe has been in a way that doesn't make viewers: Adults, Youngsters or Children feel excessively Juvenile) Sufficient to say, This Partially or Completely Unecessary belonging in the perfect Kung Fu Panda Trilogy. It'd have been better if A Furious 5 movie would've been made, I'd have rather watch that than this disappointment of a movie or whatever this ended up becoming..","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
