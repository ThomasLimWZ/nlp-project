"5","/10","A big pile of nothing","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7398229/?ref_=tt_urv","guskeller","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur88854575/?ref_=tt_urv","1 October 2021","Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a one trick pony that doesn't land its trick. The entire movie is filler stalling for its final battle, yet that showdown is disappointing. Yes, it is between two marketable comic book characters, but that's all it provides. The villain is underdeveloped and uninteresting, the imagery is sloppy and cluttered, and the choreography is nonsensical. Because there is no coherent style or vision, the sequence ends up being a big, ugly mess. Normally, the details of an action sequence wouldn't be so significant, but that's all this film invests in.Everything about the story is rushed, repetitive, and uninspired. There are no intimate moments to allow things sink in because the script lacks substance worth meditating on. The humor is okay at times, Tom Hardy is talented enough to have chemistry with himself, and effort went into the CGI (though it was overused). However, besides that, this production is pointless. Even the violence is unsatisfyingly suppressed for that PG-13 rating. Undoubtedly, some fanboys will be content with a mediocre fight between two characters they recognize, but as a film, Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a noisy pile of nothing.Writing: 2/10

"5","/10","A very bland movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7590513/?ref_=tt_urv","siderite","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3146136/?ref_=tt_urv","27 November 2021","I've seen both Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson act their behinds off and it was great. I've seen humor and dark humor work wonders for DC. I've seen Michelle Williams look beautiful and amazingly desirable. None of these feature in Venom: Let There Be Carnage.Instead you get a constant gay married couple bickering between Venom and Brock which is supposed to be insightful and funny, but isn't, a cardboard psychopathic villain that could have been sympathetic with just a few edits, a pointless villain girlfriend that has no influence on the plot of the film whatsoever, even though she has a superpower she is inconsequential, a pointless hero girlfriend who is there just to be a damsel in distress, copy pasted from the bad Spiderman films, a policeman who is there just to be the always late to the joke guy and... Dan? Who cares about Dan?! I swear the most interesting character in this film is the mean Chinese lady at the store. There is no chemistry between any of the characters. None!But the worse problem is that there is no story, no tension, nothing to solve. The interaction between hero and villain is minimal yet stretching imagination and both their paths when separate are boring uninteresting bad writing.Even the CGI fights feel pointless, as two blobs fight each other by hitting and throwing each other. Venom knows ALL the weaknesses of a symbiont and does nothing with it. Brock knows his symbiont and does nothing with it.The more I write in this review the more stars disappear from the rating, so I will just stop. This could have been the exact same movie with ten times less budget, cheap CGI and unknown actors. No one would have noticed a difference. And there is one end credits scene that is more interesting in its implications than the entire movie!! Ugh.","126 out of 189 found this helpful.

It's fun and pretty funny with some entertaining action.It's also very messy with regards to the story, action and dialogue. The action isn't as good as the first and neither is the music. The story brings no value. And there were some stupid moments.I also can't stand that it's not rated R. I could say that about the first, but it did a great job of pushing the limits while also not having too many moments where it was obvious it would have been better with blood. This movie has SOOO many moments where it could have been amazing if they went all out. It felt so censored.I try to always have no expectations going into a movie. And I knew going in that even though I loved the first one, that doesn't make this one bulletproof. But looking back on it, a movie about carnage could have been so much more. It was underwhelming. Also I wish I got more development from Cletus and Carnage.One more thing, Tom Hardy and Andy Serkis are awesome. But writing and directing are talents that very few have. I think it shows here and I would have preferred veterans at those crucial positions.I'll caveat this review by saying I couldn't understand a lot of the dialogue, especially from Venom. We'll see if that changes anything when I watch it with subs.Edit: I watched it again with subs. It didn't help. Still underwhelming. So many parts just feel off. And some scenes are straight up bad (cooking breakfast scene smh). Changing it from 6 to 5 stars. Sad face.

"7","/10","A Carnage Of Mediocre Elements and Action, Offset by A Venom Of Comedy","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7395846/?ref_=tt_urv","rgkarim","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25226117/?ref_=tt_urv","1 October 2021","LIKES:The Animation:
I'll give them props on their design for making the symbiotes come to life, Sony's latest dive into Venom's creation is very good. Tight forms, great fluidity of the black ooze that makes him up, and those sensational teeth are perfect for bringing him to life. The movement is fluid, it goes super well during the movement pieces, and the tendrils acting out the comedy moments are awesome. When Carnage appears, that chaotic redness is not quite a vivid as the comics, but definitely has the blood element and chaos of the malicious symbiote. It's grimy and viscous, and has the sinew of the tendrils that offers a little more of the nightmare that Carnage is known for, including his devilish bladed arms.The Music: I know a soundtrack for a Marvel movie is not the most noticeable feature, but much like the first film it's got attitude, beats, and some layers to it. Some symphony work goes alongside the fanfare sound effects to help make the inspiring pieces we love in super hero movies. It's the rap times though that really work and man are they awesome. Rap beats carry the harder attitude of the Venom world, with that no consequences edge that works to go with Venom's attitude. The end trailer song was my particular favorite and I liked given the sweet tones of the chorus and the verses bringing the hardcore beats.The Acting:
Certainly not the Oscar's level others have hit, but I enjoyed the performances of the cast on this installment of Venom's chronicles. Tom Hardy essentially acting with himself is certainly the highlight, with a natural flow to the chaos of the lines that he seemed to write for himself. Hardy as Eddie has the same nervous, loser attitude he conveyed in the first, that awkward atmosphere he brings doing super well to act as the moral compass to guide the ever aggressive Venom through the world. As Venom, he's hilarious, still acting like a newborn/toddler who can't take no for an answer and wants to eat everything he can for his survival. I loved the lines he delivered as Venom, I loved the joy, horror, and vulnerability he brought, and the commentary is certainly one for the books for voice acting. Harrelson still does his job well as the insane serial killer of Cletus, especially that eerie, unsettling longing that he seems to have with his darker roles. While not the most insane of a serial killer, he works well enough for the direction they took him, and they sort of corrected the hair for me so that's a win. I can't say he was my favorite villain character, so there really is not much I can say outside of a solid delivery for his backstory and that longing of something serial killer roles thrive on. Michelle Williams wins for a fun support, but again she is not utilized the best in this film and could have had more involvement on so many levels for me. The times she was on board, she was funny, a good nonverbal and verbal acting mixing to bring some of the more unique comedy moments I've seen in Marvel in some time.The Comedy:
Hands down the best part of the movie is the comedy and it is funny. Like the last installment, that dynamic relationship between Venom and Eddie is solid, a duo who play so well off of each other despite being the same voice. The aggressive personality bossing around the meeker personality goes super well, and Venom's mannerisms and taunts are a wonderful comedic tool. Then, they start using the internal monologue even better with Venom, showing that combative mindset distracting Eddie from answering normally, especially when Venom pushed enough to cause Eddie to outburst. Finally, when you see Venom get the driver seat a little bit, the writing works well with Venom exploring the universe a little more. His speeches, his jokes, and so much work with this new angle to Venom and again I was cracking up at the vaudeville humor he brought, alongside the commentary of the movie. And as I said, Michelle Williams does well in her roles, sometimes acting as a prop and other times a fantastic medium that blends all the styles together. There are a few things that Harrelson does that are funny, but they are in the backburner for me and lost to Venom's constant banter.The Mid Credits Scene:
Hands down the most exciting part, Venom's extra scene shows great promise for the series in so many ways. It's still got great comedy and chemistry you have been seeing for most of the film, but does not just act as the comedic finish Marvel likes to do. No there is some story behind it and then a nice surprise to set up the future of our dark symbiote. I won't say more to avoid spoilers, but Serkis and company get props for this one.Dislikes:
The Plot:
My friend may have liked it, but for others like me, the plot is again a rushed mess that does not utilize the characters well. The focus on the comedy allows for development of Venom and Eddie's relationship, and though not massive improvements or anything revolutionary, it works well for the buddy comedy approach. Yet, where it really went wrong involved everything else in their lives when I was watching this film. Where Anne was a key factor in the first film, became more of a side piece in this, with her plot elements opening up some comedic factor, but little else past this. The whole Eddie moving on with life and trying to adapt to the new stakes, was kind of rushed and lame, even to the point of conflict that happens in this film. The story with Cletus was... okay, and a driving factor for the decisions of how to get to Venom, but I can't say it fit with the story I had envisioned for the psychotic serial killer I know Cletus to be. And for Shriek's inclusion, held promise, but as she was not a symbiote, so she was not too ingrained into the full story. Venom's second installment does not have the same cohesiveness that other Marvel film's do and it's a shame again due to what they could have executed.Carnage feels a bit too controlled:
If I remember several comics and cartoon shows correctly, Carnage was a force that was chaotic, deadly, and insane, hence why he was able to be such a dark and threatening force. In this movie though, I don't think his utilization matched that and in fact made him a little too logical. Certainly there are moments where that primal force of hunger and death seeking are seen, but I can't say I was impressed with the other ways they took the symbiote and his host. There was no impending terror of them hunting, no close calls and horrific sequences that haunt your dreams. As for his other powers, I guess I expected more based on what the trailers showed off, but that did not happen for me. The blades were more design than used and even the projectiles were minimized, which with Carnage minimal is not way they usually go. Carnage is one of those villains whose execution requires a lot of study and detail and the direction I took only somewhat filled that craving.The Action:
Or better yet lack of it. Venom's second film is still heavily comedy based and seems afraid to embrace the action that a dark tale could really execute. Looking at the movie as a whole, there was about fifteen minutes total that we saw of this film and that's sad when comparing to so much of the other Marvel films. Most of the scuffles are one sided displays of CGI slamming that really offers no suspense or horror, so I can't say it was that exciting for me. Then the climactic ending, was kind of bland for me, again given what I've seen in the other Marvel movies. A ten minute bout of a few punches and slams that, while appropriate as a start, did not use the powers that we as fans know these monster have. Where was the dance of crimson blades a crazy, scarlet symbiote could unleash? Where was Venom's strength utilizing the environment to combat those blades and use tricks to offset the strength of Carnage? Where was Carnage's mutations evolving out and further surprising us? The answer is not on the final cut, though I did enjoy the clever use of sound bringing more of the hosts out. The final ordeal is anticlimactic for me, and did not live up to the potential that these two titans are known to bring, and could have used about 15 more minutes at least or at a few other conflicts to break it up.The VERDICT:
Venom 2 was okay with me, but it's not the best comic book based movie to come out of the woodwork. Certainly the visuals and attitude of the movie are there and the acting brings that world to life and does well with the established dynamics. It's biggest strengths for me were again the comedy and the mid credits scene, the former being the biggest selling point for fun for this film. Yet, the movie's plot is still a mess and the handling of Carnage, while not the worst, there was a lot of potential they missed out on in his use. Look wise he's great, but the Carnage I know and the Carnage I got, did not match for what I had hoped to see. In addition, the action was very limited and did not really satisfy the buildup they were trying to make. As such, the movie is okay, and fortunately has enough special effects and music to get a trip to the theater for a see. My scores for this film are:Action/Sci-Fi/Thriller: 7.0
Movie Overall: 6.0-6.5.","189 out of 305 found this helpful.

"3","/10","Not even a turd in the wind; it's just nothing.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7578978/?ref_=tt_urv","Pjtaylor-96-138044","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26820801/?ref_=tt_urv","24 November 2021","At least 'Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021)' is brief. That's pretty much the only praise I can send its way. I mean, it's genuinely terrible. Frankly, it's almost unfathomable how a team as talented as this can turn out something so amateurish. It honestly feels unfinished. Having said that, it's actually difficult to properly review, because it's just... well, nothing. It's not even boring. It's totally empty, a meal comprised of zero calories. It's also insanely forgettable. If you asked me to recount its plot beat for beat, even while the credits were still rolling, I'd seriously struggle to come up with a coherent answer. As I said, it's difficult to properly review. Perhaps that's because reflecting on it is like trying to remember a bad dream; by the time you try to articulate it, it has already slipped from your mind. Perhaps it's because it leaves you feeling totally apathetic, unequipped to even think about its events, never mind its shortcomings. Perhaps it's because the flick is genuinely less boring than many movies deserving of a similar, or even marginally better, rating, but also genuinely worse than most of those same movies. A bad movie is better than a boring one, I suppose, but a movie that leaves you feeling nothing, not even annoyance, is surely the bottom of the barrel. It goes in one ear and straight out of the other. It's awful, but I can't bring myself to get worked up about it. I'm aware that I haven't even begun to delve into its cavalcade of issues, but I just can't bring myself to do so. That in itself says a lot. I'm totally ambivalent about the piece. It isn't fun, but it isn't boring; it isn't competent, but it isn't offensive; it isn't anything, but it isn't... well, anything. In the end, it will leave you feeling like Venom himself: hungry for something with a brain. Heck, even a bar of chocolate would be more fulfilling. 3/10.","242 out of 332 found this helpful.

Naomie Harris is also great but underutilized in this movie. It has a short run time but the film benefits from the length. Yeah, it has its typical superhero overblown CGI fest ending.

Maybe he can help find the remaining missing bodies? Unfortunately, this leads to... Carnage.This is at least as big of a mess as the first one was. It's less ironically fun, because this time it's on purpose. Then again, it is also substantially more enjoyable for that same reason. It's been a long time since I've seen something that had such wild writing. Try to go in knowing as little as possible. You will definitely not guess the places it goes. The comedy is much more successful, with the highlights being Ms Chen(Lu, master of the deadpan. Please give her a spin-off. You don't even have to take her out of her convenience store. Have her just react to bizarre things that happen right in front of her) and Anne(Williams, way more into it this time, which is definitely in part down to the incredible material they give her). It's hard to overstate how hilarious these two are. The action and CG is a lot better. If all you really want out of this is to see these iconic characters in live action, it will deliver on that. If you can roll with how ridiculous it is, as I did, you will be extremely entertained. If you cannot, this is going to exhaust you, and that is the only way that the 88(!) minute running time(if you don't count the end credits, and since those have only one additional scene(which is mindblowing), and it comes soon after they start running, you might as well leave the moment you've seen that one. The cinema staff will be grateful for it) won't fly by, to the point that it'll seem like you just sat down and then the movie ended. In fact, in that case, it will probably feel twice as long as it is, if not more.This features disturbing content, with a lot of implied violence and gore. I recommend this to anyone who thinks it will be their kind of thing. 7/10.","51 out of 115 found this helpful.

Although it was critically panned by critics and somes fans alike, it became a decent success. The sequel is nowhere near the previous film, even though the previous film suffered from uneven tone all thanks to Sony and Tom Hardy's idiotic mindset to make a clown out of the
morally grey character to appease the kids and the director who understood the property correctly, aiming for a horror, mystery and sprinkled gallows humor story.Andy Serkis known best for his motion capture roles as director does his best with an abysmal storyline and banal script. Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson two of the most reputed actors are wasted as they barely give good performances. Naomie Harris as Francis is also grossly under utilized and so is the supporting cast of Detective Patrick Mulligan, Anne and her fiance Dan and lastly Mrs. Chen. Music score is bland compared to the first film which added a sense of urgency, tension and thrill, CGI is downright atrocious beyond words as expected with a budget of 110 million in today's day and age when the plot revolves around cgi heavy elements.Sony just trying to pass it off as blockbuster whereas its absolute garbage and much much pathetic compared to the first film. The characters of Cletus and Eddie is absolutely out of touch from their comic-book counterparts where as Eddie as an investigative reporter is clueless like an imbecile and Cletus as a serial killer is nowhere near the unhinged psychotic murderer from the pages of source material. Shame as i was really excited for the first ever appearance of Carnage. Even the intro of Carnage is pathetic and suffers from pg-13 rating whereas he should be bathing in the blood of his victims and was such a huge threat that Venom allied with Spiderman to defeat him.","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

And as you would expect, the visuals were something to behold and really brought venom and carnage to life. They worked well with the story but it felt somewhat rushed, despite this being a 2hr movie, but it was atleast there and they gave Cletus and Francis a reasonable back story.What disappointed me was the action, or the lack of. From the title and name, well you'd expect Carnage to be chaotic and destructive especially considering he was attached to an already violent psycho unlike venom, and he was but everything felt held back; Venom too, though it kinda made sense considering where Venom and Brocks ""relationship"" was with their rules, yet you still expect him to be unleashed especially towards the end when going against carnage, who was supposedly sooo much stronger and venom feared. It was also surprisingly not bloody, despite the violence. Part of me feels like the rating could be the problem, which restricted the creators from exploring darker more violent themes. They didn't even show venom properly feasting when chopping heads off, not even the chickens.A bit anticlimactic as well, the venom vs carnage fight could have been it but the action didn't deliver. Great visuals though. When we came out the cinema, I could hear everyone talking more about the post credit scenes than the actual movie itself. It's kinda sad having that as the highlight.All in all, I think it's a good movie, most definitely worth a watch but it just felt like they didn't let everything out the bag. It's a really fun and funny movie, just needed a little more chaos.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

Eddie meanwhile wants a more conservative approach feeding Venom chicken and chocolate as he knows the eyes of the authorities are still upon him and he has to convince the world that Venom is dead and no longer a threat.At the same time; serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) has selected Eddie to interview him in San Quentin and the two form an unusual connection as Cletus cryptically speaks to Eddie which underlines a deeper motivation.With the help of Venom; Eddie is able to decipher clues found on the walls of Cletus's cell which leads authorities to several of his victims. This results in a rapid rise in status for Eddie and fast tracks Cletus for execution as his main means of leverage is now gone.This leads to a rift where Eddie and Venom split and each has to struggle to adjust to life without one another.At this point, the film has mainly been odd bits of whimsy between Venom and Eddie around the establishment of the plot and threat. However, things go into chaos mode when Cletus becomes infected with a Symbiote and turns into a destruction spewing death machine known as ""Carnage"".Cletus and Carnage both have their own agendas and Cletus uses Carnage to exact his revenge as well as locate a figure from his past that is as big a danger as he is.As any fan of films of this genre knows; this scenario leads to a showdown between the central characters which are awash in abundant CGI, loud noises, and destruction. While this is not a bad thing and certainly one of the main reasons I enjoy films of this type; the film never seemed to fully click for me and as such was not as good as I thought it could have been.In many ways, the film reminded me of how comic-based films were done before Marvel started their own studios and their phenomenal run of hits based on their work.There have been multiple attempts to adapt comics into films over the last few decades and many of them have not lived up to expectations or failed outright. One of the biggest reasons is in my opinion is that those behind the projects were hindered by the studio, wanted to put their own spin on the material and strayed from the source; or failed to show the attributes that made the characters so appealing to fans.What we often get is action sequences and CGI galore but without stories or characters that fully draw in the audience and fail to capture the essence of the comics.Director Andy Serkis has done a great job with the visuals of the film but the tone seems off. The early part of the film is filled with comedic moments that are either hit or miss. Some of which was almost to the point where I wondered if it was supposed to be a parody.The plot is fairly linear with nothing unexpected as it is simply bad guys get loose; bad guys cause death and destruction, can the heroes stop them. The climactic scene lacks any ""wow"" moments for me as it was mainly CGI characters rapidly moving around causing damage to one another and their environment. There was no real tension for me and the ultimate resolution seemed a bit anti-climactic.For me the best moment of the film was a mid-credits scene that really popped as it sets up all sorts of interesting options and indicates that Venom may be about to graduate to bigger and better things.For now; the cast is solid as is the CGI; I just wish the story was more engaging as it had the potential to be so much more.3 stars out of 5.","21 out of 43 found this helpful.

Not a big surprise, it was predictable that a sequel was coming after the first one, they couldn't just stop right there. The first film was very, very bad. Mediocre, generally speaking badly made. This one was not the best, but it wasn't a total disaster either. I expected nothing great, and I didn't got it either. It was just a decent sequel. The plot is taking place a short time after number one, and Eddie Brock has to hide his second face, Venom. Meanwhile, Eddie is doing some crime work for the society and arrests a psychopath with a dark, hidden past. What gave the movie six starts? The dramatic backstory of the main antagonist, and how it was presented. I got a better understanding for him, and he had a nice development. The second good thing was the fun relationship between Eddie and Venom, and how they had to deal with living together and treat themselves as allies. A fun little thing that can give a laugh or two. Technically speaking did Venom 2 have nice editing, too. I liked when the ending title ""Let There be Carnage"" came with bright letters with some fast motion transitions and cool effects at the ending credits. The things that lead the rating some lower, though, was that the story was empty in the third act, and that was really bad. The action sequences were boring, too, and could have been done in a much more epic way. They could for example have better camera angles and better music to make the scenes float better. The second thing I have to poke at was the plastic acting. Tom Hardy is good as an actor, but he could have played better here. The thing is that he didn't fit the role so much. The antagonist did have good development, as I mentioned, but his acting could be more realistic, too. His acting depended mostly on effects, and his potential he could have, was lost in the visuals. After all, I think that Venom: Let There be Carnage, was a decent sequel, fine enough, but could have been made much better. They are going to make a sequel to this one, and I hope they can do things a little better this time. But this one is definitely better than the previous!","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

When a dangerous psychotic serial killer Cletus Cassidy gets his hands on the Carnage symbiote, Eddie and Venom must put their differences aside to stop the dangerous killer from reigning terror upon anyone else. So first off, Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock/Venom I thought was great. The only problem I really have with his performance is not so much as the Eddie Brock side of his character, but more of the Venom side of his character. In the first Venom, his voice and characters mannerisms when it comes to Venom was more sinister while here it sounds more like a jokester that imitating Venom instead of playing the sinister Venom we have all come to love, but other than that, Tom Hardy's performance is fine. Woody Harrelson's Cletus Cassidy/Carnage was also fine, but not as dark as I was hoping for him to be, as I felt he was trying way to hard to be the sinister character we hoped for, but instead gave us a performance that was somewhat different than what we were expecting. Michelle Williams's Anne Weying I was also glad to see make a return for the sequel. Naomi Harris's Shriek was probably the most interesting character of the entire film although I felt that they could of explored her character's past a bit more than what was shown. Stephen Graham's Detective Mulligan was also a great addition to the film, although his character left me with more questions than answers. Overall, Andy Serkis's take Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a sequel that is just fine enough to be part of Sony's new Spiderverse and a alright addition to the Venom franchise that also looks forward to the future for Eddie Brock and Venom. Rating 7/10.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

As a 90's kid seeing the first on screen portrayal of one of the most menacing villains of all time, was spectacular especially because Woody Harrelson played Cletus Kasady perfectly. Thoroughly unhinged and viciously hilarious.While the story is that of a basic showdown between the 2 Ultimate Symbiotes, the duel never fails to entertain. Some of the dialogue has gotten slightly more ridiculous in its attempts at humor which can seem a bit over the top at times especially with what seems to be a new voice for Venom which is much more zany than the first. The visuals are what we all come for and they're executed brilliantly by motion capture master/director Andy Serkis. They were able to capture the pure chaos and blitzkrieg that came with these iconic characters in the classic comics/90s animated show. Tom Hardy is once again fantastic as Eddie Brock. The body horror aspects are even more so this time around which also add an extra element to the insane experience. Overall it's a phenomenal sequel that so many have been waiting for and it sets up a ton for the future of the Venomverse/sonyverse.","85 out of 179 found this helpful.

Better action sequences (they're lit properly and most of the time it's clear what's going on)
AND
a better villain! Woody Harrelson always gets the right tone and his performance is ferociously entertaining.Also, Mrs. Chen. I love Mrs. Chen.As for negatives, the villains have a backstory that could have been interesting but is never explored. Also, there are several plot elements introduced at the end that really don't make sense and are ever explained. But none of them were particular important enough to kill my enjoyment of the movie.Lastly, the soft PG-13 rating kills the action.

The introduction is cliched, lame, unbelievable, and so childish. Same with the dialogue, how the characters behave, and the overall tone of the movie. The first one wasn't good to begin with, and this one just took it down a hundred notches. It's not even worth wasting popcorn on, if you're thinking of a brainless film to enjoy. I don't understand why Sony keeps cranking these things out, only to re-boot them a few years later. Just do it right the first time. Nothing more needs to be said - just utter chaos.

He interviews serial killer Cletus Kasady to get whereabouts to his victims bodies and to confirm his crimes. Kasady on the other hand is trying to reconnect with his childhood friend, Frances Barrison. He becomes one with Carnage moments before his execution and he can now carry out his plan.One thing I will say about Venom: Let There Be Carnage is that the villains are huge improvements over the bad guys in the first film. The first film had very generic and one-note scientists that just talked about experiments. Riot was also sadly wasted. Cletus Kasady on the other hand oozes with horror even before he becomes one with Carnage. Woody Harrelson makes this character work with his emotions and eerie politeness. The scene where he is telling Eddie about how he killed his grandmother and mother stands out to me for its creepy atmosphere in an otherwise goofy comedy. His relationship with Frances is also well done and it gives him a solid motivation for his character. Even the most evil people can have a person they love. Speaking of Frances, I really liked her too. I felt bad for her at times and I liked her power. Naomie Harris played her well. She looked so broken mentally. And of course there is Carnage who is incredibly frightening. However, I think the film misses the opportunity to make him more frightening because of the rating. It would have made his kills more effective as he rips through crowds of security officers even as they beg for mercy. Overall, the villains are great here despite some flaws.On the heroic side of the story, the movie focuses a lot on the relationship between Eddie Brock and Venom. Their chemistry is what made me enjoy the first film so much as well as Eddie reacting everything weird happening to his body. It helps that Tom Hardy gave one of the most cracked performances I have seen in a blockbuster film. The first Venom film had Hardy doing so many weird things on screen you would believe seeing in a comic book film and saying several hilariously bad lines. His performance is more tame here and while it is better, I think I prefer his take in the first film. Venom on the other hand is a riot. He is much more rebellious here, but he is making a genuine effort to bond with Eddie. The scene where he cooks breakfast for Eddie is both hilarious and oddly sweet. Their chemistry still works here for the most part, but their banter can get old because it can get repetitive when they stay on certain topics. However, the entire time, I could not help but think of them as an old married couple arguing. Their friendship will either make or break this film for you.As for the other narrative aspects, this film is an improvement over the original in several ways. The story and characters are better which makes it easier to get invested in them. We get to see more of Venom's personality and insecurities which makes him more likable. The comedy is mostly funny. You can tell that this movie caters to the fans who loved the first film with how much it focuses on the banter between Brock and Venom. The tone of the film is much zanier and goofier than the first film. However, it does get darker once Carnage makes his appearance. The humor is funny and usually well timed. The audience had several laughs throughout their antics. The dialogue still has a few lines that made me wonder who green-lit the dialogue, but it is better here than in the first film.Production-wise, I really love the looks that Carnage and Venom have. They look really cool and menacing. Carnage has a horrifying introduction that I think will scare a few people. His design oozes with creepy and coolness. This is one of the scariest villains in a comic book film I have seen from a visual standpoint. The action scenes are fine. The final fight between Carnage and Venom is a lot of fun to watch, but I think I liked the action in the first film more than the action here. The first Venom film I feel had some pretty underrated set pieces. The only standout fight here is the climax which is good because Venom and Brock need to use their wits more here than in the last film. The soundtrack is oddly solid. I did not expect to enjoy the musical score as much as I do, but it had some nice spooky atmospheric music in the score.Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a sequel that takes several steps forward and several steps backwards, but I ultimately enjoyed it. What I really respect about this movie is that the filmmakers knew exactly who they were catering to. Not the critics who bashed the first Venom film, but the fans who loved it for its insanity. They went all out with this sequel. For that reason, if you did not like first Venom, you will not like this film. If you had a great time with the first film, you will have a blast here too.Oh, and stay through the credits. Something very important happens.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

A short super(anti)hero movie? AMAZING!Venom: Let There Be Carnage isn't a great movie and has ALL the clichés of most superhero movies, but it was enjoyable. I found myself laughing a lot at Venom's one-liners and again, I enjoyed how SWIFT this movie was. That was refreshing.Despite some exposition, this is one of those sequels YOU MUST see the first one to understand this universe. And that's too bad. I rated the first one 2/5 stars and didn't care for it much. This is absolutely the better of the two.Eddie Brock & Co. - or the alien symbiote, Venom - are still fighting over superiority when they have a break-up. Simultaneously, the guy who used to bartend at Cheers turns into both a supervillain and Venom's greatest foe. Will Eddie make up with Venom in time to stop the Carnage?Yes, this movie has the age-old Superhero trope I hate so dearly: ""I don't wanna be a superhero anymore! I quit!"" usually found in the second chapter. Superman II did it, The Dark Knight did it, Iron Man 2 did it, hell, Spider-Man 2 did it, just to name a few of hundreds of examples. I hate it with a passion. So, when it happened here, I tried to remain calm. Mercifully, when Venom's on his own, he does have some fantastic and hilarious scenes. This one gets a pass because we hardly ever get to see the other side of this equation. All we usually get is the whiney non-superhero.That and some of the lazy writing's are probably the most problems of this. Everything else was fine or actually good. No one was terrible and the special effects were 10x better than the original. Recommended.***Final Thoughts: My friend with me said: We have to wait for the mid-credit scene. The second he told me that, I knew 100% who was showing up. Despite that, listen to my friend. You need to see it.","40 out of 105 found this helpful.

Venom: Let There Be Carnage happens.The writing in this was absolutely horrific. Nothing about the origin of Venom, Carnage or the symbiotes is explained in any capacity. Plot holes are taped over shoddily, and the build up to Shriek's breakout makes little sense. Since when are symbiotes capable of hacking computers? And into top secret government files in about 20 seconds no less. The movie feels like it was written by a teenager; most notably when Harrelson roars the movie's title from the top of a church spire near the climax for no apparent reason. The dialogue is filled with corny one liners and zingers that never land.Stephen Graham's character was a bright point but he was given a criminally low amount of screen time. Tom Hardy's performance was great as always, and his relationship with Venom was the only decent part of the movie. It's a shame to see his talents wasted in such a bad film. It's baffling how a property with such great source material can be butchered so horrifically.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

We see how this ripples into society and how they perceive monsters. It's a different kind of Marvel (Associated) movie. It certainly takes a lot of cues from Universal's monster outings of the 30s. Which in turn makes for a chaotic ""super"" movie that harkens back to when they were more experimental in the early 2000s. Not bad at all, just not what you anticipate.I highly enjoyed the detective story on hunting down Cletus's past by using picture clues from Cletus's cell like Eddie was looking at his own comic book. I was disappointed that those elements seemed to fly by into payoffs that felt very coincidental or chopped down for time. Besides some little exposition, this made the later sleuthing moments feel pointless in the end. In my opinion, I would have enjoyed more if the detective work was slower and led to run-ins along the way with both man and monster. This would have lent more to Eddies journey of finding co-existence and his own humanity as he continued to understand Cletus and how he naturally has coexistence with his own humanity and inner monsters.The action was on point in this film and has you excited for the next attacks and scenes. They felt like comic moments from Maximum Carnage (minus Spidey).I also enjoyed their natural use of a Mutant in this flick. Where the MCU continues to drag their feet, Sony will take jabs.The end credit scene definitely enhances the movie and helps it feel like a bigger chapter of Venom than a footnote. Some would say, the credit scene alone is worth the price of admission if you are a comic fan. I can't disagree.Overall outside of my gripes, I really did enjoy this and look forward to watching it again.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Tom Hardy's American accent (I nationalized it to American rather than just San Franciscan cause it is in NO WAY an SF accent) is also barely audible. Woody Harrelson is to me one of the greatest actors of all time and he did not disappoint. Naomie Harris was forgettable. Overall the movie was too quick. Could have had ten more minutes of material, maybe learning about Cletus' murders rather than them putting it into a montage in the beginning. Certain elements like that made the film seem rushed, which it most certainly was at only 85 minutes of actual film before the credits rolled. I'm all for short movies if they get the job done but to me this one didn't get the job done entirely.Other than Harrelson's performance and the after credits scene, most of this movie is forgettable. Three stars go to each of those factors.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

He makes a brilliant villain. I can't fault his acting. But 5 minutes into this cinematic soup and I was thanking god it was only a standard length film. I can't say my expectations were high but I thought there would be some suspense and maybe a sliver of horror. You have to wonder if a film is worth watching when you keep ending the lines yourself and when every character is a badly cut out cinematic stereotype it gets tedious.This film tries to give the villain a back story which at least explains why they turned out like they did. It's a kind of modern woke way of portraying the nuance of good and evil and level the playing field a little. Unfortunately it makes Woody's character all the more 2 dimensional and pointless.This is effectively a kids film with some juicy adult stuff thrown in. Considering the average 12 year old is pretty familiar with carnage via their games console I think many 12 year olds would find this a bit lame. With all that and the cringey CGI, it wasn't Woody's finest hour - and a half.","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

The worst part is the writing, none of it makes sense.It shows throughout that Hollywood doesn't know how to write anymore, the dialogue is bad, and their understanding of these characters are not there. All the lessons from the first are thrown out entirely, and everything that was great from the first are not here for the sequel.For some reason it's not about telling a good story, or having fun with making a movie, it's about ""narratives"" and using their ""platforms"" to spin some garbage narrative that doesn't fit reality, or even fiction.

The story is very short and doesn't really give any characters any depth. Carnage looked and sounded terrifying! The first scream of carnage definitely startled me not gonna lie.When we came out the cinema, I could hear everyone talking more about the post credit scenes and its implications than the actual movie for the most part. Great visuals though.All in all, I think it's a good movie, most definitely worth a watch but it just felt like they didn't let everything out the bag.

1. The CGI looks good which helps to prevent Carnage (Woody Harrelson) and Venom (Tom Hardy) from becoming too cartoonish.2. Both Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson provide as good as a performance as they can.3. There is fantastic chemistry between Woody Harrelson and Tom Hardy, which makes it a shame that there aren't more scenes with them two in.Cons:
1. The pacing is horribly rushed, as story-lines and conflicts are introduced and then resolved almost instantly.2. The character conflicts are exceedingly flimsy and thus uninteresting, for example that between Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) and Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) wherein they fall out of an engagement (which lasts about a minute), but in the next scene they have together they're friends again.3. The writing is incredibly lazy and it's clear that not much thought went into it. An example of this would be when Venom and Eddie Brock rally to defeat Carnage and Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) by uttering the cliche that they're stronger together than apart (even though their fallout was violent and Eddie Brock forces Venom to fundamentally change his diet, whilst claiming that Carnage and Cletus Kasady aren't symbiotic even though the inverse is true for them.4. There are too many forced conflicts which take screen-time away from the more interesting conflicts and story-lines.5. The comedy is hit and miss, but mostly miss as it felt that it was largely for immature audiences.6. Considering that this movie was about Venom and Carnage (two ravenous man-eaters), in addition to a prolific serial killer featuring and child abuse being brought up, this movie should have aimed for an R-rating but instead it played it safe and thus was more boring than it should have been.7. The movie was a little tonally all over-the-place as it kept introducing humour into the serious moments which cheapened said serious moments immensely.8. Despite there being few relevant characters to the story, most of them are still given barely anything to do.","15 out of 25 found this helpful.

It's great to see actors from this side of the pond but did it help to make a great film?Sadly not.Eddie Brock attempts to reignite his career by interviewing serial killer Cletus Kasady, who becomes the host of the symbiote Carnage and escapes prison after a failed execution.Firstly I have to thank the Marvel for one very good thing . The 97 minute runtime . If only they would make all their films this length I might enjoy them much more than I do.This isn't a great film . The story is unimaginative and the action and CGI is pretty dull which is really surprising considering it's directed by the master of CGI , Andy Serkis.Incidentally some of this film was made down the road from where I live in Bedfordshire, England .Without a doubt the best thing about this movie is the humour. The banter between Venom and his Host , Eddie Brock , is really funny . The latter being the straight man for most of the time.I'm not sure the world needs a third instalment of Venom .

Let's be straight: the first Venom movie was not good, but I still enjoyed it because of the humor. However, this movie managed to take away a lot of that comedy and created a plot that was even worse than the first one. There were so many plot conveniences that rushed the movie forward. Our main villain is just another crazy dude, nothing more than that.Of course they kept the PG-13 rating. Man Venom would be SO fun if there's gore. It pissed me off that these production companies wanted some good bucks instead of making a competent movie. The camera editing were just all over the place. I can barely comprehend what was going on. This made the action scenes messy with no fun.Even worse, the relationship between Eddy and Venom evolved in such a cringe way. Not all the humors landed, which was disappointing. Their relationship carried the first movie, but this time there's just no way.Obviously the post credit scene, which was surprising to many. However, considering how much of a joke Venom is, I'm not so optimistic about this decision.Overall, just a messy disappointment. You can basically watch the post credit scene on YouTube or something and skip this movie. 3.5/10.Go watch Titane instead, that's an actual good movie.","54 out of 110 found this helpful.

Each of the side characters have more to do, the humor is a lot less cringe, the VFX are better, and the action is more clear. The story itself is more engaging too because there's a lot less exposition needed this time around but that doesn't mean it wasn't a bit underwhelming. Director Andy Serkis wanted the movie to feel like a rollercoaster; a wild ride that ramps up and ends without being too drawn out. He managed to succeed in that idea but the origin of Carnage felt half baked for such a fan favorite Marvel character. A large reason for that is the heavy focus on Brock's complicated relationship with Venom. Although the chemistry worked a lot better than in the original movie, audiences had already seen it before. Carnage deserved much more screentime because he's one of the biggest draws to the sequel and is extremely interesting in his own right. The entire cast did a phenomenal job portraying their respective roles but some regurgitated plot points from the first movie are done here too such as Symbiote vs Symbiote, Venom and Eddie's strained bond, etc only done better. If you are a fan of Marvel or Venom/Carnage this movie is definitely worth a watch but if you aren't this movie might not change your thoughts on the superhero genre as a whole. It's worth noting the end credit scene is an 11/10 though.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The humour between Eddie Brock and Venom works once again in this one and is something I wish we had more of in the first film. It knows that the relationship between Eddie and Anne didnt work so we get less of that and more of these funny bromance moments between Eddie and Venom. Woody Harrelson kills it as Carnage.The Bad- although I liked the humour I feel that some of it doesn't land as well as it should have especially with the more side characters. Also feel like Carnage was very underwhelming for a character as big as they are in the comics.Overall Thoughts- Overall Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a fun blockbuster that is sure to get some laughs out of audiences while providing some good action and is a definite improvement on it's predecessor so I'm going to give 'Venom Let There Be Carnage' a 7/10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, for me, the sequel - ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" - delivered even less. And I found aspects of it positively distasteful.Positives:
Negatives:
-- Firstly, virtually nothing happens. It's not too much of an understatement to say that the whole plot can be summarized as a) a villain is introduced; b) the villain teams with another villain and c) Venom defeats them. It's just all so bland and linear, without any sort of discernible story arc.-- For a movie pitched more at the comedy end of the Marvel spectrum, the script is unpleasantly violent. (And, yes, before Marvel fan-boys attack me with comments, I know that this Sony/Marvel offering is NOT part of the official universe). There are numerous points at which I thought ""Ugh!"" and a nasty taste entered my mouth: the butchering of a 'Family man' prison guard, pleading for his life; the brains of a very polite young grocery store boy being senselessly smashed in; and the massacre of a priest in his own cathedral. (Actually, I have no idea what happened with the priest during the ""power-up"" scene - - a cut by the censors perhaps?) My issue is that, tonally speaking, there is a horrible mismatch between these unnecessarily violent scenes and the lighthearted and flippant nature of the rest. It's like putting a vicious gang-bang rape in the middle of ""Ant Man"".Summary Thoughts on ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"": You'll already judge from my balance of comments that this one just didn't work for me. Even as a ""park your brain at the door"" action movie, I thought it felt lazy and lacklustre. My advice? Save your money and go and watch ""The Last Duel"" instead.By the way, there is a mid-credit monkey (end-credits scene in onemannsmovies speak), worth staying for, which ties this Marvel offshoot to another sector of the Marvel catalogue. However, note that there is NO post-credits monkey!!! Like a whole bunch of us in the cinema, you'll feel pretty foolish if you sit through the interminable titles just for the film to end and the lights to come up!

As a lesser comic book nerd, I don't know everything about the character but I know enough to feel like that black blob on screen isn't Venom and his amorphous, indecipherable blob enemies were pretty much as generic as could be. BUT! We ended with a promise of Carnage and Carnage has always been a favorite.Well, much like I still don't think this is really Venom yet, I don't really think this was Carnage either. First of all, these characters just... One's Black and the other's Red. That's pretty much the main differentiating factor between them (aside from tentacles). We also struggle with the relationship between Cletus and Carnage not being as it should be but... Artistic license! Fine! The ending is infuriating though, with the exception of one thing in the post credit scene.These movies just feel like a cash grab to me. A soulless journey to line Sony's pockets without actually making movies with any real significance at all. Everything about them is so generic and bland. Like in an effort to avoid the Spider-Man connection they've left out everything that made this character unique and interesting. Here's hoping his next appearance leads to something better but so far... I think both of these are completely skippable movies.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The Felix and Oscar feuding between host and symbiote seemed forced and grew more tiresome than amusing. The CGI action sequences were severely deflated by bad cuts and worse lighting, diminishing one's ability to identify who was doing what to whom.

Sure, I watch them because they are entertaining enough for what they are. But it is not something that is important for me to get to watch, as I have little interest in superheroes and such. But given the production scale and CGI of the Marvel movies, of course I watch them for the entertainment.And ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" was actually a standard run-of-the-mill Marvel movie, with some back and forth in the first two acts, and then a massive CGI showdown third act. I guess the guys at Marvel have one formula that they make movies after.Writers Kelly Marcel and Tom Hardy put together a movie that was entertaining enough for what it was, and something that felt like it fitted into the Marvel scope of movies. So on that account then ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" was doing well enough. However, if you look at the storyline objectively here, then it was a bit flaccid and lacking in-depth contents. It was essentially just flashy CGI and symbiote fights. And some attempt at sob stories with Brock and Anne.In terms of characters then ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" felt somewhat lacking. The characters felt one-sided and one-dimensional, with the writers not doing much to let the audience submerge end delve into richly detailed character stories and archs.Speaking of characters, then the Venom symbiote was the star of the movie, no doubt about it. And it was certainly fun to watch Carnage on the screen. I am not familiar with Carnage as I never read the comic books, but of course I know of the character as I am no strange to the world of comic books. The human characters in the movie felt like they were mostly just fillers. Personally, of the human characters in ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"", then I found Mrs. Chen (played by Peggy Lu) and Frances Barrison (played by Naomie Harris) to be the most interesting in this movie.I found ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" to be as the 2018 movie, watchable for the CGI and the action, but mediocre on the contents in terms of script and storyline. It is hardly a movie that I will be sitting down to watch a second time.My rating of ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" lands on a bland five out of ten stars.","50 out of 104 found this helpful.

Because if so I think you missed Carnage's character, which is intended to be scary. He's the symbiote of a serial killer who finds enjoyment in the killing of others. Are you telling me you wished his roar was at a whispers volume? Wow.This movie deserves more than what it's getting, they first gave rise to a Marvel villain who's completely underrated and gets no attention. When this movie came out they ENHANCED how scary he is, sorry if you thought he was ""too loud"" for you, but sounds like you don't know what a jumpscare is. Not only that, but people are saying, ""I disliked the first one so I dislike this one too"" just keep your mouth shut. If you didn't like the first one, then why bother seeing this one?!

It's an insult to the talents of Michelle Williams, Naomie Harris, and Robert Richardson. But most importantly, it was an insult to my time, as it took much more from me than merely ninety minutes.The first ""Venom"" was bad for its reasons, as it was tonally inconsistent, with Tom Hardy and director Ruben Fleischer having conflicting ideas on what the movie should be. In the end, Fleischer's darker take overpowered Hardy's goofiness. Throw in weak characters and plot, and you got yourself one of the worst movies of 2018.""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" has addressed one of those problems, as it swings the tonal pendulum entirely in the other direction, resulting in self-parody.The sequel picks up where the last film left off, with Eddie and the alien symbiote, Venom, learning to live together within the same body. The two of them seem to be ripped from a Capra screwball comedy, as they're sparring in slapstick fashion.Marking his return since the post-credit scene in the 2018 original, the deranged serial killer, Cletus Kasady, is about to be put on death row. But before that fateful day arrives, Cletus and Eddie's paths cross, resulting in the birth of Carnage, the T-1000 to Venom's T-800. Cletus and Carnage spark their symbiotic relationship, one that seeks the doom of Eddie, and the rescue of Cletus's longtime flame, Shriek.Replacing Fleischer, who was busy with ""Zombieland: Double Tap"" and currently working on ""Uncharted,"" is motion-capture wizard, Andy Serkis. It's a fitting lateral move, considering he's worked with visionary directors such as Peter Jackson (as Gollum in ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) and Matt Reeves (as Caesar in the ""Planet of the Apes"" trilogy), two people able to seamlessly blend visual creations within reality.Serkis hasn't fancied himself much as a director, with ""Breathe"" and ""Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle"" being so underseen that they may as well not exist. With ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage,"" Serkis has landed on strike three, hopefully landing him in director jail.There's an erratic and jerky quality to film, one that tries to reflect the inner torment between Eddie and Venom. Locations become interchangeable, and so does logic as character motivations become lost in the struggle. Much of the actors seem lost as well, with Michelle Williams (way too talented to stoop this low for a paycheck) constantly trying to find a reason to exist beyond just being the contractually obligated ""love interest that got away.""Things quickly become hard to follow, with Venom acting as Eddie's inner monologue, butting in at every possible moment with one cringe-inducing line after another. Integral information is doused while three characters speak at the same time, making the effort needed to keep things straight not worth it. Once Venom and Eddie split up their bromance, you're relieved as it means a few moments of peace and quiet.There also seems to be an inevitable ugliness to the ""Venom"" films, as Matthew Libatique turned in the worst work of his career in 2018, and now the legendary Robert Richardson (a frequent collaborator with Quentin Tarantino, Oliver Stone, and Martin Scorsese) produces his most drab and cheap-looking work. At some point, you have to wonder how many people are involved in this franchise just for the money.Definitely not here for the cash is Tom Hardy, who has deepened his involvement by receiving the first writing credit of his career. Hardy has always delivered 110% for each of his roles, even if it wasn't in the best interest of the film. With this sequel, Hardy, as well as Harrelson, have dialed things up to a ""Looney Tunes"" level of zany. There's at least some unintentional comedy in their line readings, with a highlight being ""I'm a real boy and you're just an amoeba!""The badness of ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" made me appreciate other comic-book films even more. Marvel may be getting stale with their formula, but at least it works on a fundamental level. And based on the post-credit scene, we'll have to see which side of the coin wins out, a battle which I am not looking forward to.","10 out of 16 found this helpful.

I was fine with it, to be honest. Things don't need blood or gore to be brutal, and I think this film did it okay.What I really disliked about the film was the detective and Naomie Harris' character. Those were the weakest parts of the film, neither of them needed to be in it.The best part was the Carnage fights, especially the third act. They really knocked it out of the park with the effects and such, and sure, it would've been cool to see blood and gore as well.It was better than the first one, in my opinion. The villain was much better, not counting Naomie Harris' character. The story was more compact and low stakes. The humor worked better. VFX looked much better etc.If you expect blood and gore, you might not like the film. It's a very hit or miss, and for me it worked. 7/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, it did not quite meet my expectations. The first 'Venom' was definitely better, and not anything glorious in its own right.

It would have been hilarious if they brought Juliette Lewis in to play Shreik. Instead, Naomie Harris was cast, and she basically just plays her role from 'Pirates of the Caribbean'.The movie just felt a little too goofy and tame to feature characters like Venom and Carnage. They swap terror for explosions and destruction with a PG-13 rating.Bottom line, what Heath Ledger and Christopher Nolan did for the Joker, Harrelson and Andy Serkis were unable to do for Carnage.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Instead relying on the special effects way too much.The first movie was slightly disappointing (if you watched the trailer you saw everything of note) but it did lay the ground work and back story for Venom and Eddie Brock. This sequel presumably takes place some time not far off the first movie and Eddie is tasked with interviewing death row prisoner Cletus Kasady. The movie essentially follows a collision course between Eddie and Cletus.Ultimately the movie is fairly predictable from start to finish. The story is lacking, rushed and seem forced upon us from the off with little motivation from any party. We do get some back story of Cletus, but the whole time you are expecting more of a connection between the main characters that never happens.My biggest issue however is the over use of Venom. The effects for the most part of exceptional and seamless. We seem Venom in full form a lot (too much) and we also see Venom partially separating him self from Eddie so they can have face to face conversations on a frequent basis, which makes absolutely no sense. They also amped up the character of Venom to be an unruly teenager type jackass who holds all the cards, which is fine, but it was just so overused and the humour failed to land.All in all the movie looks incredible, it just doesn't go anywhere and doesn't develop the characters at all. It's worth a watch if you enjoy Marvel movies however this is definitely one of the weaker entires in its expanded universe.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I cannot understand how this passed multiple screenwriting phases. This is vomit and dog feces on a screen. I wasted my time watching this movie. Ever since Logan, Marvel has been downhill ever since. I'm begging and pleading Marvel to return to its roots, and put it massive budget to proper use. This is not what Stan Lee would stand for if he was still with us. I feel disgusted and repulsed by what I just saw. This is movie was just an armature performance and a mediocre story at best. At this point they are just churning out movies for the sake of being relevant and creating box office numbers. The only point where any marvel movie is interesting now a days is after the initial end credit where there's a 30 second to a minuet teaser for the next movie. How far has marvel fallen from its heights. Do better marvel, your fans deserve it.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

The movie knows how to tell an understandingbly villain motivations, a great character arc for Cletus Kasady and for me the villain in this film is better than the first one. There some great moments playing during the fight scene and the fight scene is an improvement but sometimes they decided to throw in some cartoonish jokes.

I feel like including carnage in a PG-13 movie is a little strange, as how carnage is a brutal serial killer on the marvel comics, its a little odd seeing him coated in PG-13, you can see this clearly during carnage's rampage at the prison. Another problem was that sometimes the writing was a bit sloppy, the writing is not horrible, but the film just could have been written better in my opinion.Overall, this is a fun film with some problems, but for what it is, it's pretty good.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

For a hero or anti-hero to have a decent story at least there has to be a story, a motivation, and also a worthwhile villain. In this case they managed to destroy Spiderman's most important villain (Carnage) by including him in a story where the producers, screenwriters and director did not know what to do. The big mistakes: repeat villain; the villain of the first Venom and the one in this film are almost the same. Cletus Kassidy's lover does not use the name Shriek (her character's name) and does not even use all the powers that correspond to her according to the canon. Woody Harrelson's look varies between Venom 1 to Venom 2 which marks a disaster in the aesthetic continuity of the character. Venom's character becomes increasingly unbearable and doesn't generate any sympathy at all. So much so that one begins to miss the Raimi version of this character. Considering the derivation of the character, it is absolutely correct to affirm that Venom will never be able to star in a decent movie since the scripts are by rule horrible, the direction lackluster, the production is not ambitious and the attachment to respect the legacy of the character is non-existent.","17 out of 32 found this helpful.

I had my concerns about this film, and I had almost no expectations, but from the PG-13 rating to the drastically short run time I knew this film was going to be in trouble.While in certain respects this film does certain things better than the first, it tragically also does things even worse. The films tone is all over the place, trying to be comedic yet maintain it's dark tone. Half or more of the jokes don't land, and are terribly placed.Tom Hardy is great as Eddie Brock/Venom as expected, Woody Harrelson is great as Cletus Kasady/Carnage. Yet that is the most praise I can give Carnage, because he is extremely watered down to fit this PG-13 rating. When Carnage was revealed it should have been terrifying, I should have been shaking in my seat. He has the presence, and the acting from Woody Harrelson carrys it, though disappointingly falls flat.None the less there's still enjoyment to be had from this film. Great cinematography, CGI, score, all these things elevate the film. What should've been, what could've been a dark horrifying thriller of a film depicting these characters accurately instead falls on it's face due to short run time, terrible pacing, and incompetence or unwillingness from the studio to push the PG-13 rating or go for the R rating.Although there is excitement to be had from the implications of the mid credit scene, I am personally still left with concerns for the future.4/10.","40 out of 86 found this helpful.

Usually the sequel should be better, as a rule, the main characters are revealed on the new side, the universe of the film expands or the answers left by the viewer in the original are given. So in the second part of Venom all this is not. This is the same film as in 2018, only with a new story, which is also worse. Of the pros, you can note the excellent acting of Tom Hardy and a good picture.

And they enjoyed it, so kudos to the Hardy/Serkis team. The phrase that both resonated with after watching was ""the film did not take itself too seriously.""I did notice that Hardy was listed as a co-writer, along with Kelly Marcel. So kudos to Mr. Hardy, and I think he strove to keep Eddie Brock as an old school style Marvel hero, with his personal life in a shambles. I'm not comic connoisseur like my kids, but that was my take. And perhaps working with Ms. Marcel, they were trying to amp up the romance in the film?I'm not talking about the bromance between Brock and symbiote (although this film is a sort of successful couples counseling if you want to view it that way). But between Carnage and Shriek....granted their relationship has clear problems based on their powers. On screen I felt the chemistry had more problems, and as much as I appreciate all things Woody, his unnatural born killer here felt a bit wooden to me.Or maybe it was dwarfed by the CGI. Here is another point where my kids and I differed, they liked this more than the polished/refined CGI they've seen in other Marvel movie product. To me, it was just too omnipresent. But yeah, I've drifted far out of the demographic from when I first introduced my young lads to the 60's Spiderman cartoons. (Reminds me that one of my sons really dug the soundtrack here btw...)Anyways, the body surfing by Venom was the high point or me. Recommend watching it with people you love who really want to see it, then all is good, right? Hell I should give this a rare 10 just for that ;>","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The mayhem and destruction that comics and all the animated series brings in for Carnage was unjustified for the film. I went to a theatre half-full (sadly, Covid times) with Marvel fans mostly everyone had a similar reaction as hootings and shouts at a typical first day Marvel launch was missing.The movie was a long-awaited project for MCU fans, and it did fall flat on the expectations as the film lacked character arch for one of the evilest villains in Spider-Man Universe to show how Carnage became what it was, the gore and glory of the madness he brings in. Meanwhile, Venom was shown quite soft and funny what it's not supposed to be, nonetheless, it was delightful to watch Tom Hardy play the character with its twists and turns of punches it brings in. Another thing I felt missing about Carnage was the psychotic voice it always portraited, the film felt monotone flat on it.The movie screentime was typically very short for what you expect a superhero-comic movie to be and could have gone easily longer to add more depth to it. I believe they could have made it more gore like how Deadpool and Logan are but surely the box-office mattered much more to the producers.The only thing that got me excited to jump off my seat was the post-credit scene. Boy O Boy! It was worth it all for that moment. Excited to see what Marvel got in the bag for future projects.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

As for the film itself it can be a mixed bag at times, but I did enjoy it. Woody Harrelson's character takes more of a center focus than Tom Hardy and the titular character- which can be interesting but also a bit frustrating cause the film feels like its missing the point. No matter what you thought pf 2018's Venom, it was clear that Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock/Venom was the best part- so why underwhelm the audience with needless drama just to further the plot and come up with something more original? That being said, Harrelson's character is rather fascinating to watch unfold on screen- and they do give him a bit of a heart, which is also great to see as well. There are tons of funny moments throughout the film in its entirety. The soundtrack is nothing special, more of the same from the first film, but the plot is kinda all over the place. It feels like Director Andy Serkis doesn't quite know what to do with the films titular character- especially when it comes to tone. They could have made a lot of the scenes with Venom a whole lot more enjoyable and less harsh to watch. That being said, the film itself is very entertaining, I was never bored with any of it, even despite its flaws. Yeah its messy and yeah it can be predictable, but despite Serkis's bland directing- the film does manage to gain a lot of empathy from the audience and prove to be quite a blast to watch. If you are looking for an extraordinary film, this isn't the one for you, go see Shang-Chi instead, but if you're looking to kick back and relax- and maybe just enjoy yourself- this may be your cup of tea.My Rating: 6.6/10.","12 out of 37 found this helpful.

It fully embraces the cheesy 90s camp that many loved and derided about the first film. It can be fun, but also feels like we've advanced so much farther in the genre beyond this.This movie felt like a sprint. It's a quick 90 minutes that moves at lightning pace. Not much time is spent in the way of characterization, especially for Cletus Kasady. The Eddie and Venom bromance takes up most of the runtime, which is wise given that was the highlight of the first film.The plot is pretty generic and really only feels like it's there to set up the inevitable Venom-Carnage showdown. The fight is good, but man could this movie have really benefited from an R rating. It feels like we got a needlessly neutered version of Carnage.This movie isn't anything to write home about. The mid credits scene is about the only thing you'd be missing by not watching.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

I can say you're gonna find more comedy in this one than the first one. However, the comedy is too overdone and overused. Meaning you laugh at it a couple times, but then it gets to a point where it just gets repetitive and then you just sit there with a forced laugh, a straight face and slightly annoyed. Kinda how I felt half of the movie, which is not good. I THINK that Carnage should've just been a movie by itself and only about him, THEN we have Venom vs Carnage. But unfortunately, too much felt crammed and rushed into this. If you're a fan of the first one, I still recommend you go see this one just to see what's up. I can say this though, you're gonna think it's nowhere near as the good as the first one and you'll see exactly why. P. S: You'll LOVE the post credit scene!","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

A movie should grip at your emotions, how can this happen if we don't care for any character? Who are we rooting for?Sound harms venom we got it, why repeat it so many times? The audience isn't that dumb. Throughout the movie information repeats itself a few times to make sure the viewer gets it and it isn't subtle at all.The VFX are better than in the first one.

The cinematography is nice.Overall, a movie you wouldn't remember in a year.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Director Andy Serkis and star Tom Hardy, who also penned the story, play up the strengths of the first Venom and double-downs on the comedy.It is a funnier and more confident movie than the first. I laughed a lot at the gags. Tom Hardy's committed double performance as Eddie Brock and Venom, constantly bickering like an old married couple, remains the price of admission.The first Venom had a sluggish uninteresting first act, taking a long time setting up its story before Venom and Eddie Brock ever meet. In Let There Be Carnage, Andy Serkis compensates with a straight-to-the-point approach that moves like a rollercoaster and dispenses with self-important world building and teasing the next installment, which becomes the film's strength and weakness.Unfortunately, at a 97-minute runtime, Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson do not have enough time to chew scenery and build a dynamic between their characters and are rushed along to service the plot.There are also less oddball spontaneous moments like Eddie Brock climbing into a lobster tank in the first film. It's hard to tell with its rapid pacing. The comedy, centered on ""what the heck"" moments, could have benefited from more awkward pauses. Every scene is truncated in such a way that I expect there's going to be a 2-hour director's cut on home video release later in the year.The adults who have read Venom since the nineties are all itching for an R-rating. There are missed opportunities for some R-rated violence that will have the adult comic book fans thinking about what the real Venom would really do. Personally, the CGI-laden fights were the least interesting parts. It is during the fights the film feels like a Marvel film, which it isn't.What Venom: Let There Be Carnage will appeal most to, in fact, are ten-year-old boys. To them, Venom is the coolest looking irreverent comic book character and kids can enjoy it as a fun dark thrill within safe PG-13 parameters.The ideal audience for Venom: Let There Be Carnage is the adult comic book fan father taking his ten-year-old boy to a matinee. They'll laugh together at all the gags and cheer along when criminals' heads are being eaten. Afterwards, they go home and the mom asks the dad, ""Why did you take our son to that?"" The dad struggles and replies, ""I can't explain it... it's just fun!""While it won't elevate the Sony Spider-man Universe franchise out of its underdog status from the dominant Marvel franchise, Venom: Let There Be Carnage's biggest strength is that it doesn't take itself that seriously. If you liked the first Venom, you're most likely going to enjoy the sequel. If you didn't, then definitely no. It is that simple.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The scenes for some reason feel wrong?? Almost like a collection of poor quality drawing board ideas that were FILMED before being finished. Really cringy acting and horrible jokes do a great job derailing any hope of a positive experience from this movie, which is confusing because Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson are both amazing actors. The CGI effects used for ANYTHING venom does (talking, crawling, moving around) reminds me of a PS2 cutscene. The sense of humor this movie has is virtually nonexistent, with the bad one liners and outdated references. The almost childlike arguments between Venom and Eddie made me squirm in my seat with discomfort as the theatre remained silent and nobody laughed.Save your time, money, sanity, and soul and do NOT go see this monstrosity.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

When Venom was about to be released, I had zero interest, and being a Spider-Man fan myself, that shocked me. I just didn't think a villain story that only exists because of Spider-Man could've worked on its own. To my surprise, while Venom wasn't a great movie by any means, I ended up having some fun with it. For that, I was certain they could improve on it with a sequel and Venom: Let There Be Carnage does just that. It's still not that good, but the novelties are cranked up to eleven and I had a blast with those elements of this film.Picking up after the first film, Cletus Kasady's (Woody Harrelson) history with Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is about to come to a head. With Kasady on death row and about to be executed, he stumbles upon a way to escape, which eventually turns him into the even more villainous Carnage. Hellbent on nothing but destruction, Carnage poses a real threat for Venom/Eddie. Other than a couple of surprises along the way, that's pretty much it for the premise. The movie wanted to pit Venom and Carnage against each other and it doesn't do anything except that. The fight and the journey to that fight is what made the movie worthwhile for me though.Tom Hardy is one of the most gifted actors out there and his quirky performance with Venom (himself) is what sells these movies. If it wasn't for his commitment to this role, these movies would be absolutely terrible. On top of that, Woody Harrelson clearly knows the type of film he's in because every moment he's on-screen is a joy to witness. He doesn't have the same relationship that Venom has with Eddie, but that's also what made it more entertaining. His character is a murderess, evil convict, but Carnage is even worse. This makes for a climax that feels earned, even though the cast is just having fun most of the time.The weakest portion of the first film for me was the fact that I didn't care about the relationship between Eddie and Anne (Michelle Williams). Her character was barely in the film, but you were meant to feel the loss Eddie had after breaking up with her. This time around, she's given a little more to do, but she also feels like she's more aware of the type of movie she's in. Even though the first movie was a little self-aware, they've now fully leaned into that. Venom: Let There Be Carnage is nothing but silliness, but it's very entertaining silliness.Overall, Venom: Let There Be Carnage probably won't win anyone over who didn't like the first, but I'll still say it's a better movie as a whole. It's a very breezy 97 minutes and it doesn't waste any time with side plots. There are quite a few weird and bizarre scenes, but it works if you're aware they're doing it on purpose. Andy Serkis as the director here took the things that worked about the first film and just did more of that, leaving the excess in the past. If you're just looking for a simple, fun time at the movies, Venom: Let There Be Carnage is purely that. There is also a major post-credits scene that says a lot about the future of Marvel. I will give this one a mild recommendation.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

I enjoyed it because it had a simple but interesting plot, plenty of action scenes that were combined very well with comedy and in general it was entertaining. Its short duration helped it to become interesting and not boring but if it would be rated with R it would be even better. The direction which was made by Andy Serkis was good and he followed the same pattern as in the first movie of ""Venom"" and his touch was obvious through the whole duration of the movie. The interpretations of Tom Hardy who played as Eddie Brock / Venom, Woody Harrelson who played as Cletus Kasady / Carnage and Naomie Harris who played as Frances Barrison / Shriek were very good.

Despite this, now we have VENOM: LET THERE BE CARNAGE, a movie that is created with decent enough concepts and intentions, but which, in execution, ends up being one of the uninspired and difficult to stomach superhero films of the past couple of years. The Disney superhero films are known for their use of awkward humor, for better or for worse -- LET THERE BE CARNAGE, a Sony-produced film, makes Marvel look like comedic geniuses by delivering an onslaught of flat and downright boring comedy that makes this Venom film come across as the worst buddy comedy since the Will Ferrell Sherlock Holmes movie.The previous Venom movie -- which, although by no means great, looks amazing in comparison to its sequel -- included a decent amount of humor that revolved around Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock, a struggling journalist, and Venom, a parasitic alien who attaches himself to Brock and begins a strange friendship with him while supplying superpowers. The humor was very much a polarizing aspect of the first film, and with LET THERE BE CARNAGE, Hardy (who is both a writer and producer on the film) and crew decide to double down on the humor and get rid of almost everything else that could have made this movie even the slightest bit interesting.The film has almost no actual plot besides the relationship between Venom and Brock, and a cheesy serial-killer villain played by Woody Harrelson who also gets a symbiote similar to Venom (but more powerful somehow? This is never explained) inside him because he bites Eddie and tastes his blood. Not once was I actually invested upon either the villain or the protagonist, nor were there any stakes for any of the numerous CGI fight sequences that fill this movie. I understand that the filmmakers were looking to create a goofy and ridiculous action romp that doesn't take itself too seriously, but they neglect almost everything that makes a movie good in the process, rendering any attempt at camp moot. If one makes a ridiculous and goofy movie, and then proceeds to forget good plot, humor or characters, I don't see any point in producing said movie.None of the acting is terrible in this, but Hardy, Harrelson, and especially Michelle Williams feel as if they're trying to make the most of a script that was written without much thought or care injected into it. The expository dialogue near the beginning of the film feels like it was taken from an ""exposition dialogue generator"" that someone Googled for lack of a better source. Some of the jokes throughout this movie are somewhat funny in concept, but in execution the punchlines rarely land, making the majority of scenes feel as if the characters are part of an inside joke that nobody told you about.I must say, I was skeptical going into LET THERE BE CARNAGE for one big reason: the runtime. The movie clocks in at exactly an hour and 30 minutes, which is the shortest it can physically be while getting a theatrical release from the studio. Very few movies I have seen can make that short of a runtime work, and almost all of them are either animated films or horror films. Going in, I expected LET THERE BE CARNAGE to be a rushed and disorganized experience to some extent, and unfortunately I was spot on. The first 30 minutes seem as if the writer was trying to get through as many exposition plot elements as fast as humanly possible, making none of these elements feel believable or interesting at all. Even though I didn't want to sit in the theater with this film longer than I had to, I feel the movie would improve if 15-20 minutes were added to give the characters more weight or to give the story more of a dramatic pulse. Instead, it seems the filmmakers did the bare minimum that was possible in the storytelling department, which at the very least makes for a movie that won't waste too much of the audience's time.It seems that VENOM: LET THERE BE CARNAGE is making more money than any film to be released since the beginning of the Covid pandemic, which makes me lose some of my faith in humanity (Although to be fair, I contributed by spending eight dollars to see this film). I am just hoping that this success doesn't mean the studio will decide to fund three more Venom films of the same quality. In about two months, I feel that the world will forget this movie existed, save for the after-credits scene, which is more interesting than the rest of the movie combined even though it makes no sense. Maybe I just have no sense of humor, but VENOM: LET THERE BE CARNAGE struck me as one of the biggest misfires of the year from a major studio, and I very much hope that if more movies are made with these characters that they vastly improve almost everything.D.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

Now finding a sort of peaceful co-existence w/the Venom symbiote, Eddie Brock, Hardy, has gotten his life sort of back on track (being an ace reporter again & living w/the fact his ex, again played by Oscar nominee Michelle Williams, has moved on). Into this fractious détente comes a call from a death row inmate, played again by Oscar nominee Woody Harrelson (who cameo'd in the last film), to tell his tale (where we've seen in flashback Harrelson's romance w/another disturbed inmate, played by Oscar nominee by Naomi Harris, cut short when she used her power, a banshee type scream to escape during a prison transfer but gets shot by a cop but not before deafening him). W/Harrelson's story published, he believes his & Hardy's life are entwined even inviting him to his last meal where he takes an opportunity to bite Hardy thus infecting him w/Venom & creating Carnage (which prompts an explosive outbreak from prison) whose sole goal is to reunite w/Harris & take revenge on their foes. Definitely better that the first film now directed by ace mo-cap performer Andy Serkis but it still has an air of 'what for?' hovering above it since Venom doesn't exist, at least for me, w/o the presence of Spider-man so the film ends up being an unabashed cash grab w/o a hint of irony or subtlety.

But even that gets, shall we say, overly abundant. And, without subtitles, a good deal of Venom's dialogue is hard to understand because of how his voice is processed.The cast is along for the ride - so points for people working for that studio money. Although I could have done without the product placement. Why not just call the chickens ""Sony and Cher""? That would have been a much more apropos and funnier tie-in.My biggest problem is the CGI. It just looks quite video gamey and out of sync with the world of the movie - which is odd since Serkis is usually a master of bringing synthetic cinematics to live. I suppose it is more the appearance rather than performance that breaks the illusion for me. It was constantly on my mind while watching them that Venom and Carnage looked drawn ON the film space but not organically IN the film space.Otherwise, it is mostly mindless brain-eating fun.Oh, and Woody Harrelson's hairpiece is also distractingly not of this or any other world. I hope it is the next Klyntar in the series.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's a plot that definitely divides, the comedy might not be to your taste, the characters might not be for you and the plot might be either too tame or too extreme. Below is my personal thoughts, bare in mind it's from the view of someone that enjoys marvel films and watches a lot of them, but not keen enough to give a toss about the marvel universe. (Skip to final para if you can't be arsed with the in depth).The Comedy: I personally found the comedy element to work really well. I sniggered a good few times and I don't think it was overdone and used in a way that didn't affect the plot.The plot: the plot I found ok. It focused a little too much on the character arcs of Eddie and Venom, it wasn't offputting or anything drastic, but I feel like we could have got more from it. Seemed to lack that ""wow"" factor. But overall it's definitely watchable and not overly confusing or challenging. You can sit back and relax and just simply watch with ease.Special mention to Woody Harrelson who I thought did a really good job. The character Frances I found really jarring and I just could not get into it. I can't overly pinpoint why, but from the get go she was dead annoying and couldn't be bothered whenever she was on screen.The CGI overall was done really well on the whole. Maybe a couple of minor dodgy moments, but when you have a film so heavily reliant on CGI then it's bound to happen. But overall I was impressed.Overall, the reason I think people will be very polarised on this, is because the plot just isn't very meaningful. It's a lot of carnage and nothing else too much on value. I personally liked that as I could sit back and just zone out almost and watch a fun film. The films comedic elements will also be a little opposing as peoples sense of humour will always be different. But it's harmless jokes and fun.If you like your heroes to have humour, like a lot of action and enjoy Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson then it's 100% worth a watch and you will enjoy. 7/10 from me.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

First, I'm not familiar with the comics, so this review is based solely on the movie. Second, the first one was way better in my opinion. I gave it a 9/10.The visuals were pretty good in the whole of things. I didn't really see anything that made me cringe at the CGI. It was fluid throughout. The biggest thing I look for in CGI are vehicles and buildings and I was pleased how both looked. Everything felt real, especially, when they were getting destroyed.The fight scenes were both cool and fun to watch, as well as a bit messy. While it wasn't difficult to understand, or follow, some of the scenes seemed to be cluttered with a lot of stuff. This made the overall enjoyment to be had, hard.As with the first film I enjoyed the relationship between Eddy and Venom, however, the comedy between the two felt a little to forced. Like life had actually gotten to them and they were tired of each other's BS.The other titular character, Carnage, was cool to see. Somehow he felt under utilized and kind of wasted in this film considering it was supposed to be about him. I didn't end up liking Woody Harrelson as the Carnage character, but I did enjoy him as the psychopathic killer. It felt like a classic Woody being Woody.As with the fight scenes the story felt messy too. At times I felt like there was a weird jump in sequences or the timing of why we were brought to a certain place. It just didn't sit right with me.Overall, not a so bad movie. It didn't leave me as moved or happy as the first film. The relationships felt wasted and droll. Visually stunning, but sequentially a little messy. You may or may not be pleased with how it turned out, but I will say it was a least worth the trip to the theatres.That's all for now, I hope you enjoy the show!","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Perfect tool for Carnage. It is all about Woody Harrelson being Woody Harrelson. If you have seen him ranting in Zombieland and the sequel, you know what I mean.Tom Hardy (Venom) has to be the most over-rated actor in the history of cinema. He looks like some kind of klutz, Deputy Doofy from the Scare movies, a mental defective carrying around a psychotic sociopathic parasite that wants to be a comedian. Just the most bizzarro dumb & dumber you can ever imagine.Perhaps the most blatant point that everyone ignores is that there is no SPIDER-MAN in the Venom movies. Spider-man is the arch-nemesis of both Venom and Carnage. There are literally hundreds of comic books about Venom or Carnage or both of them fighting Spider-Man. Dozens of trade paperbacks. So how do you do a series of Venom/Carnage movies without Spider-Man? WTF??? How lame is that?","29 out of 63 found this helpful.

The story telling was unoriginal & very juvenile. Boring & very predictable. It felt too safe with no risks, especially towards the end. I was barely motivated enough to finish out the last 20 minutes of the film. We all knew what was going to happen to the characters at the end.Some positives.. The acting was great. The characters were (are) great. I enjoyed the movie's fast-pace flow, to a fault. I'm also glad they embraced the silly side of the Venom-Eddie Brock duo. Tom Hardy as Venom/Eddie Brock is entertaining stuff.Venom has always been one of my favorite characters in the Marvel Universe, so it's a little disappointing for the first 2 movies to turn out the way they did. This franchise (still) has a lot of potential to do something great, and not just above average at best. I'm hoping Sony turns the keys over to Marvel like they did with Spider-Man. The Marvel universe could use an anti-hero, like Venom.I am glad to see the movie did VERY well at the box office. Last time I checked it was 3rd on the highest (domestic) box office list, behind Shang-Chi & Spider-Man. I'm looking forward to see how the 3rd Venom movie or appearance turns out. I'm hoping for a Spider-Man/Venom crossover.My rating on Venom: Let there be Carnage is a 6 out of 10. Or 61 out of 100.If you lower your expectations enough, you just might like it.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Another thing the movie significantly improved on were the action sequences. Having a director like Andy Serkis on board means we can expect top notch CGI, and we definitely got that. The final fight scene was spectacular in its visuals. What I liked the most about LTBC is that the film has a very concise goal in what it is trying to achieve. It knows it is over the top and outright insane at time, but that is precisely the elements that people loved about the first one. Andy Serkis simply takes the good elements, and amplifies it with a little more polish.Unfortunately, the movie achieves all this at the cost of many film-making principles, and did feel underwhelming at times. The plot is razor thin and rapid cuts in the editing does make things confusing. Apart from Eddy and Venom, there is very little care given to other characters, and I expected them to make a more compelling Carnage, who wasn't utilized well. Naomi Harris's character of Shriek also felt half-baked, and she didn't have much to do. Given it was only 1 hr and 37 minutes, the movie could have taken another 20 minutes to tell a more compelling, fleshed out story, which would have enhanced LTBC's strengths.Overall I give this movie a 7/10, which might seem a bit high given my criticism, but ultimately it came down to the fun factor and ""buddy cop"" dynamic of TH and Venom which is the highlight of the movie. In terms of filmmaking, LTBC is underwhelming in contrast to other MCU films, but that unorthodox approach is what makes it a fun experience, and allows me to overlook it's downfalls. It is somewhat refreshing to have a movie that doesn't follow MCU's formulaic script, while still entertaining us with plenty of fun moments. That post-credit scene ensures we will be having a very interesting showdown between Venom and this ""other guy.""","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Andy Serkis, what a talent.Not only a legendary actor (renowned for his skill in front of the camera) but an utterly phenomenal director (behind it) who succeeds in impressively rescuing a franchise (previously doomed to fail) by finding a tone to strike which previously didn't work in the debut installment of Sony's current anti-hero trilogy. Ergo, rather than creating an unintentionally hilarious film (like 2018's ""Venom"" - a genuine embarrassment of a movie, comparable to Sony's other stinker, ""Morbius""), he instead opts to construct a sequel that happily pokes fun & guffaws at the camp absurdity of its own nonsensical concept (aiming effectively with intent - refraining from manufacturing yet another misfire), alleviating the jarringly misplaced seriousness of his predecessor & allowing the audience laugh with the script, rather than laughing at it - which is a hugely important distinction to make - resulting in a vastly improved (& genuinely funny) approach that ends in a far more enjoyable viewing experience, balancing comedy with genuine character development & also, a surprising amount of darkness (featuring the heavy implication of shockingly gruesome deaths happening out of view throughout - for fans of gore) too.Hence, ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" (the title as subtle as you should expect the rest of the production to be) is one of the most humourously flamboyant - unrepentant in its silliness - & intentionally homo-erotic narratives (delivered in a tongue-in-cheek wink manner on screen - capitalising on the theme of two men cohabitating inside one increasingly less reluctant male host like a bickering married couple) I've seen in a major blockbuster (Tom Hardy playing 'Eddie Brock', blatantly the bottom boyfriend - having a lover's tiff with his partner, the top symbiote - a guy he occasionally permits entry to his body - words I never imagined I'd be typing out) in recent years. Forget the heterosexual romance... Michelle Williams has been friend-zoned. This goes unrepentantly GAY & I loved it.Additionally, Woody Harrelson joyously has visible fun on set, chewing scenery as the ridiculously nefarious antagonist 'Cletus Kasady' - admittedly two-dimensional in his characterisation & not exactly original (in his powers / abilities), yet developed just enough for the impression of complexity to be suggested - so he's not a stereotypically forgettable ""bad guy"", but thankfully (by comparison) does fulfill his basic narrative purpose, in contrasting against the main guy, resembling the lesser of two evils, giving us someone deliciously ominous to oppose.Plus, with Quentin Tarantino & Martin Scorsese's frequent cinematographer (Robert Richardson) at the helm (with Fabian Wagner - another phenomenal DoP residing over additional photography), over-seeing the visual quality of the filmmaking, it's rare to witness a piece within this genre look so goddamn good.Therefore, by the standards of most generic blockbusters - 2021's follow-up to the recent box office hit feels like a pleasingly welcome accomplishment.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

We are supposed to watch a bloody movie, but what a shame a movie that is not suitable to watch even in the halls
The conclusion is that the movie ""Venom 2"" has no creativity, it is just a commercial movie that only wants money, there is something that made me happy, and it is an advertisement trick that was very interesting and this is the only creativity in this work
6/10 By the way, this is a lot of rating for a movie
Thank you.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I think it was the case, in the first, where Tom Hardy was testing the boundaries of the role.Here he looks more at ease with his character.VLTBC is effectively a buddy/buddy movie but whereas you have smart talking cop and his straight laced partner here we have the same except both cops inhabit the same body.I must say, I chuckled along to quite a lot of Venom's one liners.The plot is silly but perfectly plausible in the universe. And at only 90 minutes long it does s great job in entertaining.I would say the end credit scene is worth waiting for.It is what it is. A popcorn film. It isn't pretending to be anything else and is directed well by one Andy Serkis.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I absolutely loved getting to see more of Venom and Eddie's relationship. They had good character development as they lead to live with each other and I think Michelle Williams as Anne was good too. She has some fun with the role. However for a film that is titled ""Let there be Carnage"", I think it needed more. There's only boss battle between Venom and Carnage and it comes out right at the end of the movie. And despite being touted as an impossible fight to win, Venom easily defeats him. Which isn't a surprise, you are watching a Venom film after all. You know the hero wins. But it just didn't help to make Carnage look like a real threat. And I also think the film needed more backstory on Cletus and Shriek's relationship. It didn't do much to make care enough about them. But I think if you are a fan of Venom there will be lots to still like and have fun with. After all Venom and Eddie are clearly the best part of the movie. There is also is a great post credit scene.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The dynamic between Eddie and Venom is what makes this movie great just like the first one. Carnage is a great villan and Woody Harrelson does a good job. Didn't care much for his love interest Shriek, the actress did a good job just the writing doesn' do much for her.

Unfortunately, what we have here is very much more of the same - sloppy storytelling, disjointed pacing and phoned in performances. Harrelson seems like the perfect Kasady/Carnage casting choice on paper, but he just doesn't fit right in the role somehow. The plot is boring and utterly predictable (hero loses his powers only to have his love interest kidnapped so has to get them back to save her... am I talking about Spider-Man 2 or Venom 2? Answer: both), the film just doesn't do Carnage justice at all, and the CGI effects seem worse here than in the first film. Hardy still does well with his Brock/Venom relationship that has more spats than a troubled marriage, Michelle Williams who plays Anne is much better here than in the first film, and Naomie Harris was actually pretty great as Shriek. Overall it's not terrible, but it should have been a lot better. Maybe third time will be the charm?","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The symbiote lives in Cletus Kasady, a death row inmate who wants to see Eddie Brock while in prison and is now an enemy in avenging him.Venom: Let be Carnage is an equel directed by Andy Serkis. Didn't really expect much, but it looked a long way from the first movie. Andy Serkis displays a sense of horror in this film. However, in fact, throughout the film, it does not give a sufficiently horrifying impression. It can be said that the visual appearance of Carnage with his attacks looks scary and terrible. In fact,Carnage's brutality didn't look satisfactory. It's unfortunate for the character development part of Carnage and Cletus Kasady isn't so great that throughout the film their potential is not apparent. A Carnage who is predicted to be capable of savage tapil does not give a fierce appearance. Likewise with Cletus Kasady who actually looks quite dangerous. It's the result of the film moving so fast that it all feels so undeveloped. Venom and Eddy's conflict seems to me to be unimportant and unnecessary. This is because the conflict between them does not have much impact on the film so Carnage as the main enemy has no value. Too much focus on the story eliminates fight scenes that could otherwise give it its own charm. And one more thing, the scene of Cletus' letter why should it be depicted with a cartoonish feel. I don't think it fits. Overall, this movie is still good even though it is far from the first film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I feel like a character like Carnage, given how gruesome he is in the comics; deserves even more satisfying kills and the movie should've been longer... felt like alot of things happened and they needed a longer run-time to make the movie seem less cramped. Andy Serkis is a incredibly talented man and is one of my favorite actors and I know this is one of his first BIG movies he has directed ( know he's directed a few movies but nothing to this caliber) I'm hoping that he can direct the next Venom and do a even better job than he has already..

Or at least the two could have occasionally come face to face in between and then finally meet at climax for the final showdown (like in spiderman 3, spiderman and sandman's rivalry) but sadly they have just one sequence and thats it!VENOM carries forward those hilarious Venom-Eddie banters from the 1st part and this is the only thing that clicked. We really had a good laughter session while witnessing venom and Eddie argue.You ultimately realize, this film is more focused on the Eddie-Venom relationship rather than Carnage and this disappointed me but still i quite enjoyed it thanks to the comic timing of venom and some decent action at the end .","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film is directed by Andy Serkis, the director of Breath and Mowgli.In the film, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) still lives in the same body with symbiote Venom. Eddie tries to revive his journalism career by interviewing serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) in order to find more clues about the murders he is suspected of. When Kasady attacks him, he also gets a symbiote called Carnage and knows break out of jail and cause mayhem, Eddie and Venom must now make up their differences and stop Carnage.After the first Venom movie, this sequel is making a movie that fans have been waiting for, as they now use the character Carnage. Director Andy Serkis has experience in conveying characters with multiple personalities in the same body, having become famous for playing the character Gollum in The Lord of the Rings film series.Because of his position as a director, he helps to properly transfer the effects in the film. Because he has looked at most scenes with an eye for detail, the symbiote scenes also come across more believable in this film compared to the first film. He knows how to provide entertaining action scenes. He also helps Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson play their dual roles in the film.The weakest point of the film is unfortunately the story, because that was largely conceived and written by Kelly Marcel alone. In other films she has worked with others on the film scripts and has independently written the screenplay for Fifty Shades of Grey.This is reflected in this film. Fortunately, the comic moments come across well, because she got help from Tom Hardy here. The romantic scenes that play a major role in the film appear weaker, so that the viewer doesn't really care about the romantic scenes. The ending is also a bit rushed. Tom Hardy comes across well and believable again in the dual role of Eddie Brock and Venom. The two characters come across as a couple stuck together in the same body and trying to make the best of it even though they don't always agree. Woody Harrelson has been seen by fans as the perfect casting for the role of Cletus Kasady and Carnage since acting in the movie Natural Born Killers. He manages to portray the role in the film in an appropriate and comical way, but he is a bit counteracted by the lesser script. Michelle Williams and Naomie Harris play their roles well in the film, but if they had been given less time in the film, the lead roles would have had more time. This could have made the movie a little better.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's more or less the same with a larger emphasis on being funny and failing pretty miserably at it. These are dark characters, especially carnage, and they NEED a rated R tone. Instead they lean into making it more family friendly oriented so they can get a PG-13 rating and make more money. The design of Carnage was amazing and Woody does a great job as Cassidy but there is very minimal character building with him and especially his pointless girlfriend/wife(?) that serves no real purpose other than being able to Make sounds that bother the symbiotes. This seems like a movie that should have went straight to streaming just like the first venom did.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Read all the comics up to Maximum Carnage, played both video games and even love the Green Jellö music. And from its announcement I knew it wouldn't hit its full potential since they weren't going to go full bore with an R rating. Cletus Kassady is one of the sickest serial killers in comic book history and they completely fumbled on fleshing him out properly but tone wise his scenes are more appropriate than the silly slapstick relationship between Eddie Brock and Venom that somehow manages to be even more ridiculously absurd than the first one...not sure how.This is absolute garbage and the ONLY reason I gave it 2 stars was because 80% of Carnage/Cletus scenes are okay and Shriek kicks butt.

"5","/10","Hardy Sells Out Again but Venom 2 Only Survives Because of Sheer Campy Fun","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7433082/?ref_=tt_urv","CANpatbuck3664","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur63857399/?ref_=tt_urv","11 October 2021","Most people who liked the first Venom (me included, it was a mixed but diverting effort) were in agreement that the most enjoyable part was watching Eddie and Venom goof on each other and their banter. I'm pleased to report that they actually listened to the fans and they included much more. A lot of the dialogue is off kilter and hammy but it also delivered the only laughs I got in the movie. Tom Hardy is trying his best again, he's less of an action hero and more of a comedian in this one and while a lot of his material falls flat, some of it did land.Leading into the performances, although his effort was consistent, a lot of Hardy's performance was undercut by how goofy and poorly stitched together the rest of the movie was. He's an extremely talented actor and its cool he got a story credit but he couldn't punch his way through this. Woody Harrelson looked really bad in the marketing, it wasn't his fault though. His acting still dialed up way too high on the overdone scale but how they choose to use his character is bizarre, there's so little character motivation for his clash with Eddie Brock and his subplot with Frances is so undercooked, I just can't put that on him. Speaking of Frances, how did they get Naomi Harris for this role? She gets nothing to do, her character is poorly written and she's all over the place. I've liked her so much in other things, I just felt terrible for her. Ditto for Stephen Graham as Detective Mulligan, he's shown up in some terrible stuff before but there wasn't a chance here with how half baked his character was. Lastly, Michelle Williams is back but she's an afterthought and other than some of the random hi jinx, she's given nothing to do.The first Venom was pretty reliant on the CGI for the action, I thought it was pretty good actually but Venom 2 largely offers more of the same. I wouldn't say they're bad or even lacklustre but serviceable is accurate. Carnage is affected by the dramatic side of the movie so when he starts throwing stuff around and causing havoc, its not emotionally wrenching but it looks okay.I've listed as many positives as I can, Venom's achilles heel is the story and its handling of the characters. Small issues right? With how they handle Cletus/Carnage there's almost no conflict, its also the same with Venom and Eddie. There's no serious threat to their friendship or their partnership and while their bickering is amusing, it doesn't amount to a story. Let alone what they do with Frances and Detective Mulligan, it all amounts to a giant mess. I don't know if I've ever seen such a high budget movie that had so much work into it that was so slapdash and carelessly thrown together from a story perspective.If I were to take any kind of emotion out of it, Venom: Let There Be Carnage would be up there with Old and Wonder Woman 1984 as the biggest misfires I've seen lately. Lucky for Venom 2, there is such a things as being enjoyably bad. There a lot of campy gold here and it sustained me through the rest of the crap. So while I can't recommend seeing it in theatres, if you're into so-bad-its-good movies, this could be worth a watch. I'm not sure if I want a 3rd one though, there was a lot of potential after the original Venom, if this is the direction they chose to go, maybe its best to call it quits.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

No actor was pushed further to the back than Williams who was stuck with a weak ""damsel in distress"" arc while Harrelson and Harris take turns over-acting the other making their pair of villains some of the weakest in recent comic-book movies memory.And then there is the performance of Hardy as Eddie Brock. He is sleepwalking his way through this film, looking like he has very little interest in what is going on and just wants to grab his paycheck and get home.Some of these sins could be forgiven if the CGI elements - and the battles between Venom and Carnage - are interesting. Unfortunately, they just are not - they are ""fine"", but nothing interesting or original, so this film is destined to get washed off the shore (and memory) as quickly as a sandcastle is washed away on a beach.If you are going to check out this flick, make sure you stay for the ""end credits"" scene (which is only, thankfully, about 2 minutes into the credits), it is the best part of this film.Letter Grade: C+5 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","23 out of 49 found this helpful.

The first Venom did not do it for me as well as many others. It split audiences into those who really liked it and those who hated it. It felt like there was no middle ground. But with the change in directors and the thought of Carnage being part of this story, it did bring me to want to go out and see it. And though this may have got somewhere that the first didn't, it didn't get to where I would've liked to have seen it go. Here, it embraces campiness and doesn't take itself as seriously as the first. I feel like they were trying to make up for last time. As campy as it tried to be, I don't think it quite understood how to utilize it. For me, the beginning and end embraced it the most. When it did, I found myself sort of enjoying it. We saw this with Malignant last month, but this is another movie that feels like it could've been some b-movie found in the back of a video store. Had it not tried to force itself to be comedic and take some things as serious as it did, maybe it could've gotten to that level. Mainly, it's the story that disappoints. There's so much to unpack and they do so in around 90 minutes. I love the runtime, but it moves by so fast there is literally no room to breathe. There's hardly a quiet moment. After some time I just wanted a break.Somewhere within the second act, the movie kind of loses what it's trying to be. The story becomes messy and can't decide where to go. Most of the comedy takes place in here and some of it does land. This whole section is like a side plot that could've worked elsewhere. Tom Hardy pulls this movie together. You know that he loves being Eddie and Venom and wants to make the most of it. Woody Harrelson is a good addition to the franchise, but I don't think his character was nearly fleshed out as he could've been. Carnage has some big shoes to fill, and though the movie doesn't do him justice, the fight scenes are great. The action is a lot of fun, though it can be too much. Everything turns to CGI, but much like Godzilla Vs. Kong, we're in it for the action scenes. I will note the production design, especially in the last act looks great. They had the right atmosphere going to match this haunted looking church. Maybe it's just me, but it put me in the spirit for Halloween. Overall, this didn't live up to the hype. It felt more like a filler movie within the franchise, besides the great after credit scene. I was entertained and everyone in the theater was too. But if you're looking at the story, it's rushed, messy, and not all that great. Andy Serkis had the right idea and so did most apart of it, but they couldn't quite get to where they wanted to be.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

So it surprised me when I found myself enjoying this one! It's pretty much what you'd expect coming out of the first Venom and just a lot of the same, but ultimately improved in some areas. The one thing that I did enjoy a lot more was that it didn't take itself so seriously, it seemed to have a lot more fun and have a lot more jokes mixed into the movie. I especially loved the Venom and Eddie relationship and how they portrayed it as an old married couple bickering. Their relationship and arguments are easily the most entertaining parts and setup some of the best comedic moments. However the story and movie itself felt extremely short. Before I knew it, it was over and it felt like nothing major really happened. The film moved very fast and felt like was rushing through the plot points and never took any moments to breathe. It felt like it should have been 15 or 20 minutes longer as the story was just too short and didn't seem to have enough substance. The movie just felt like it was missing something. It didn't feel like it really had iconic Venom moments either, like in the first movie did. Tom Hardy is great as the lead once again but much like the first film, he feels underused. He is absurdly entertaining as he argues with Venom though! Woody Harrelson also seems to be having a lot of fun as Carnage but again doesn't really have that much to do in the movie (and his wig is terrible). I also really didn't care about Cletus' girlfriend plot at all. And this just goes back to the story not having enough depth or substance to it. All the expositional scenes seemed to have been cut, there was nowhere for the actors to act. It felt like they didn't know what to do with the characters, only knew that Venom and Carnage had to fight. The only character to really improve from the first movie was Anne, Michelle Williams' character. Instead of her just being the love interest, she actually has a part in the action here. I love Andy Serkis, so I feel like I'm not the best person to critique his directing, which is pretty medium, but I feel that he brought a lot of interesting ideas to the table. Thanks to him, the CGI is much improved over the first film, to the point where the third act doesn't feel like a complete CGI mess. The action is cool and some of the stuff with Carnage is way more brutal than I expected it to be. But it doesn't feel like the iconic fight that it should have been. Also I'm so sick of mental hospitals being in superhero movies... it just reminds me of New Mutants (and who wants to remember that??). But, to redeem itself, the movie plays it's one f-bomb card perfectly! The whole movie had this sort of campy and cartoony vibe to it which isn't much different from the first film, but I'm still not convinced it fits the character that well. It's fun but it doesn't make for a very good or memorable movie. HOWEVER the end credit scene completely redeems it as it is extremely mind blowing and really important to see if you are a Marvel fan! Like this end credit scene makes the whole movie worth it, and is one of the most aggressive and shocking end credit scenes I have ever seen from a business and creative perspective. The movie itself has its moments and was really entertaining to me, but overall is only a slight improvement over the first film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A good sequel, but too short","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7449655/?ref_=tt_urv","sjhunt-50458","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur139540570/?ref_=tt_urv","16 October 2021","Venom (2018) was a hugely conflicting film between fans and critics; many people really enjoyed it and many disliked the film, fortunately I am one of those who really liked it, so I was excited to watch the sequel, especially knowing that Carnage (one of the most beloved Marvel villains to ever be written) was in it.First of all, I really enjoyed Eddie and Venom's dynamic in this film, which is great as it was one of my favourite things about the original; so those of you who may not have enjoyed Venom (2018) but liked the dynamic between the two characters, you may be satisfied with the sequel too. I also thought that the film displayed Tom Hardy's acting much more in this film. I wasn't originally hugely amazed by his performance and accent in the original but this film sold me on him more, which is great as I am incredibly fond of Hardy in his other roles such as Max in Fury Road (2015) and Alfie Solomons in Peaky Blinders (2013-), and also as a person in general. And I think that the CGI has improved since the first; I never had a huge problem with it in the first film, other than a few shots being off, but I couldn't find anything wrong with it in this movie. Woody Harrelson also is of course great as Cletus Kassidy, he is one of the funniest and coolest actors about today. One thing I'd like to add is that it's very consciously silly at times, more than the first I'd say. So if you didn't mind the goofiness of the original, then you won't have a problem with this one. But it won't be for everyone.However, my main complaint is that I thought it was way too short. I didn't think it was enough to fully dive deep into finding a connection with the characters of Carnage and Shriek. Like I previously mentioned, Harrelson performs greatly and so does Naomie Harris for that matter (who plays Shriek), but the film is too short to appreciate them enough. I wouldn't go as far as saying that Carnage was underwhelming; I thoroughly enjoyed some action scenes involving him, but we didn't get enough time with him to appreciate him enough. I wasn't expecting the next Thanos, but I did want more.My final thing, is the mid credit scene. You MUST stay for it, definitely one of the coolest mid credit scenes we've ever seen in a comic book movie. It will for sure get you excited for future appearances of Venom.Overall, Venom: Let There Be Carnage is good comic-book movie worth seeing especially if you enjoy the first film and Marvel in general. You can definitely tell Andy Serkis is involved with this one, as it's very goofy at times and silly, but it can be quite dark and creepy at times. Just the main thing holding it back from being better from the first is the short runtime. But I very much enjoyed my time in the cinema watching this one.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Eddie seems otherwise normal but when danger arises, Venom may protrude from his body or even transform him into Venom in order to deal with it. This time the plot concerns how the reckless actions of Venom gives rise to a new foe which scares even Venom himself. Why that fear should exist in him (it?) is glossed over in the film but perhaps is explained in some other medium in which the characters exists, like comics or whatever, so, in that sense, it excludes the casual viewer of this film.The principal antagonist is Cletus Kasady (played by Woody Harrelson). With Frances Barrison (played by Naomi Harris), they are star-crossed lovers, following a well-worn trajectory: boy meets girl, girl is forced into high-security detention due to an X-Men kind of superhero ability, boy becomes even more of a mass murderer than he was before and...you can guess the rest, I'm sure.I saw a trailer for this film in the cinema a few weeks back and it looked interesting enough to take a chance by seeing it, even though I hadn't seen the original film in this new franchise which is, no doubt, the origin story of the Brock/Venom pairing (not quite as formidable a pairing as Brock/Richards or Brock/Perkins but still). Generally I found the film amusing enough for the odd couple antics of Brock/Venom. Well, since I've never seen the TV series ""The odd couple"", maybe the better analogy is to invoke the antics of an old couple which bickers most of the time. Most of the humour comes from Venom but maybe I only understood what he said about two thirds of the time, due to the special effects applied to generate his voice. There's violence in the film but I don't remember it being too shocking (I saw this today), however, if you are squeamish, I suppose the appearance of Venom out of Brock could be a bit much for some although it's more anodyne body horror than anything else. Otherwise there's really not to much to wag your finger about. There was frequent talk of ""brains"" in the film but, again, any horror or violence is only intimated. The ""M"" rating the film has in Australia is appropriate.If you can say that the narrative arc of Kasady and Barrison is shown here, maybe you can also say that other characters' origin stories as superpowered are also shown but once again, I'd guess that to get full value from those scenes, you'd need to be immersed in the lore of this world from other media, like comics etc.Maybe others will get more value from the Kasady/Barrison narrative arc than I did and rate this film higher than me. Which is not to say that I don't realise that Kasady does raise a fair point to Brock late in the film. This film was entertaining enough but even the usual Marvel teaser during the end credits didn't leave me with the desire to see the next Venom film. I do have a vague recollection of that original film being received negatively by audiences and critics, which was confirmed by looking at the Wikipedia page for it in writing this review. That being said, I might be interested in seeing that Venom origin story...and I missed the chance to record it on FTA commercial TV the other day...so...maybe next time? I would hazard a guess that the humour works better in this first sequel, in any case...although...I found the character of Doctor Dan (played by Reid Scott) a wet blanket in this film. There's not much sophistication to his time on the screen. Maybe he's not bad...he's just drawn that way?","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

To be quite honest, I found this film funnier than any mainstream comedic film that's been released in the past couple of years; one scene in particular in which Venom was attempting to make Eddie Brock cry had me rolling in my seat, practically crying of laughter myself. Make no mistake, this sequel takes the camp and goofiness of the original and amplifies to a degree so absurd that if you find yourself unable to adapt, you'll certainly despise this film.However, I enjoyed the silliness of the first act - it was genuinely funny, filled with slapstick comedy and great chemistry between Venom and Eddie. And if you enjoy this type of comedy, you'll probably enjoy this movie as well. However, if you came into this film to see action, and I'm assuming most people will have that same desire when they're buying a ticket to this movie, then you'll be very disappointed.There is barely any action in this film, and when there is, it's as watered down as my father's whiskey on the rocks after leaving it to sit on the table for two hours. You may have heard director Andy Serkis say that this film ""pushes the PG-13 rating to its very limits,"" and that's a bigger joke than any gags present in this movie. The violence is so bland that it's practically directionless; everyone's favorite Spider-Man villain, Carnage, is about as threatening as a Build-a-Bear plushie. Sure, you see him cause a little havoc, but it's nothing too graphic, or disturbing, or menacing, especially when compared to ""The Dark Knight,"" a superhero movie that actually did push the PG-13 rating to its limit.So, if you're not getting good action, what are you getting? A good time. Like I said, this movie is so silly that I found it practically impossible not to have a grin on my face for the majority of its run time. And even though I did find myself disappointed with the lack of grit, I was entertained enough to look past that and roll with the punches.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"","","Big whacky fun with some intense visuals and scenes that improves upon the first outing.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7534400/?ref_=tt_urv","Darwinskid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur12357883/?ref_=tt_urv","10 November 2021","I thought the first Venom solo outing from 2018 wasn't all that much to write home about if I am to be perfectly honest - It didn't have much style to it, and the filmmakers were clearly unsure of how to best present their subject matter. Understandably it can be hard to find solid footing when you're working without some very integral parts of the titular character's mythology, but the movie made enough to warrant a sequel and decidedly went with a different director, this time by the multi-talented Andy Serkis, and brought in popular enemy to Venom in Carnage. The over-the-top and silly attempts at comedy are better staged and executed than they had in the first installment, the cinematography presents a more vibrant look that blends blues and reds together quite well and effectively, and despite it's PG-13 they manage to execute Carnage surprisingly well enough. Woody Harrelson to no surprise does pretty well as Cletus Cassidy, Naomie Harris is a delight, Michelle Williams feels like she really wants to take part in this production unlike last time where her face read ""paycheck gig"" repeatedly, and Tom Hardy looks to be having a fun time going all out as both Eddie Brock and as Venom respectively. It's short and fast paced, probably the best way to go about it given that the first one often dragged here and there, the post credits scene is definitely going to talked about for years to come. Not a great movie, but fun for an afternoon.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The pacing in this movie is fast that it leaves zero room for the movie to slow down and take time to breathe. I feel like for some people this kind of pacing with work for them but for me I kind of wish it slowed down because everything in this movie felt bullet-pointed. The first act of this movie went by so fast that once we hit the climax of the movie, I was like Oh wow it's nearly over. But that's not to say I didn't enjoy what I say in this movie. I feel like all of the actors in this movie were having the time of their lives. Tom Hardy did a stellar job once again and brought so much of the humour that I really enjoyed. I'm not fully sure why but to me Woody Harrelson just didn't work for me in this movie. I could tell he was doing his best and trying super hard but I just didn't really care for him and his character in this movie. I mentioned the humour in this movie earlier and I feel like it might work for some people and not for others and surprisingly it worked for me. I caught myself laughing quite a bit while watching this movie. The last thing I'll mention is that Andy Serkis was a great pick to helm this project and direct it. In the end, Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a VERY fast-paced movie that has a slow first act that picks up in the second. There is only one post-credit scene that you should definitely stick around for.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

On the other hand, his relationship with Venom sometimes works, other times feels too childish and over the top.The villain Cletus Kasady, played by Woody Harrelson, is one big missed opportunity, especially considering Carnage's origin and evolution in the comics. His motivations are superficial and too cliché, while the performance itself isn't really impactful or memorable.At times, it felt like the script didn't know what it was going for or that it was all over the place. The movie itself is too rushed and definitely deserved some more development, as well as the secondary characters who are in the movie for no particular reason.The VFX aren't well done or impactful, neither is the soundtrack composed by Marco Beltrami.In the end, this movie fails at being one exciting story for the Lethal Protector.

Not everything has to be a perfectly made masterpiece - especially superhero films! I think people forget this a lot. It's great if a movie has gorgeous cinematography, a plot that makes perfect logical sense, impeccable pacing ETC but the MOST important part of a movie is that it's enjoyable to watch! And Venom 2 was enjoyable to watch!It felt like a wonderfully refreshing change from the usual Marvel films. I think Marvel films have been loosing touch on what the original appeal of superheroes & supervillains are - it's just goofy, wacky fun that plays with an unrealistic concept! And you know, sometimes it's really cool & it works out when they experiment with more serious, dark or morbid stuff, I'm not saying it all has to be PG silly kids content, but I'm sick of how *not fun* superhero/villain films have been lately. Venom is fun!The plot is fairly simple & straightforward. The A plot is ""This serial killer has a symbiote now & we have to stop him"" & the B plot is ""Venom & Eddie are having relationship troubles"". Or ""friendship troubles"" if you want to be in denial. Anyway, I liked this. I liked how it wasn't overloading my brain with 50 plotlines to follow. It was simple, fun & an enjoyable watch.I thought the ""bigger villains"" of this film where more interesting & fun to watch than from the first film (especially Francis) & thought they made pretty good foils to the main characters. I did feel that sometimes the pacing was too breakneck fast & at points very jarring & inconsistent but also I think it fits the chaotic vibe of Venom pretty well, it just was a lot for me personally at some points.The GCI on Carnage was a lot better than what was going on with Riot in the first film & the action scenes where better too honestly. I appreciate how it leaned into the chaos more than the first film, but I wouldn't say it's hugely better. They're about the same level of enjoyability overall, honestly.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Just off the end credit scene alone; for all my marvel fans, this is the moment you've been waiting for.Let me get back to the film, Venom: Let there be Carnage uses the same structure as the first installment( established the tone, introduced the issue, showcase issue with character development, end with an action-filled battle). This time around, the film updates us on Eddie and Venom's relationship while gradually building the plot up by introducing characters; resulting in a cinematic climax between Venom and Carnage. The comedy aspect is more engaging and funny.I enjoyed this film, making this more comical server better displaying Eddie and Venom's relationship. I am confused about the creation of carnage because it isn't clearly explained, especially if you are versed with the first installment. Also, I question the similarities to the first. Not enough for me to not like this movie nor say it wasn't better.Verdict: If you are a Marvel fan, you should already watch this film. This is better than the first; yes, there are some questionable aspects: the similarities, clarity, and subordinate characters' importance. Yet overall, it's a funny, action-filled movie!6/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

In regards to the first film, this is definitely better. The first one took itself way too seriously and was very poorly lite. This film definitely becomes much much goofier after the opening scene and has more of a sense of personality to it than the other film. There isn't a lot of personality as it becomes very formulaic. All of the acting is pretty bad but in a fun kind of way. Tom Hardy is definitely having a lot of fun and gives the best performance but Woody Harrelson and Naoime Harris are so bad that they are funny. Their chemistry is nonexistent and even leads to some logical issues in the final battle with Harris's powers. The visual effects range from pretty good to awful in the span of seconds. There is a scene where Woody Harrelson in his Carnage form is breaking a cage and it looks absolutely awful but the rest of the visual effects don't look bad at all. The action and editing are both pretty bad but it's more the fault of the editing than the actual action itself. The editing is very fast paced and cuts very rapidly where it can be somewhat hard to see what is actually going on. This is an improvement from the first film though. One major thing I will give the film is its enjoyment and runtime. It's very short plus it's hilarious. Most of the time it's unintentionally funny but still very funny none the less. I found myself to be laughing at the film a lot more than usual. Even though I don't have a lot of positive things to say about this, I would definitely recommend checking it out. Watching it with friends would probably be the best option.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Awesome Action-packed Fun Sequel, A Very Entertaining Buddy Movie, Both Venom's Are Awesome.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7766460/?ref_=tt_urv","lukem-52760","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur90278387/?ref_=tt_urv","16 January 2022","I loved the first Venom & i also really enjoyed this fast-moving sequel, it's a damn good thrill ride with a more faster moving story & shorter running time. Hey both Venom films are Awesome fun.No bloated superhero epic here & that was so refreshing & felt 90's old school. Also the film looks fantastic just like the first film so that was nice that the visual style was continued & that the lovely San Francisco setting was kept. Everything looks great & so it should with the ridiculously mega budgets these Marvel films get. ""Carnage"" is alot of fun with many humourous moments & kinda feelgood feel to the film which i liked alot. Venom is full of fun & winds up Eddie most of the time like a weird double-act but within one person lol. Comedy & special effects are what makes this Venom film stay very entertaining. Yeah the first mega-hit Venom is probably/maybe the best of the two for it's story, main villain & first interactions between Eddie & Venom but this sequel is only just behind it for a fun piece of fantasy entertainment & at it's heart it's a buddy movie. Tom Hardy also looks best here as Eddie with his Beverly Hills Cop style jacket that just gives him an 80's feel & feels iconic right away. I still think the first Venom is the better film of the two but hey i love these Venom flicks & need more lol.Tom Hardy is excellent again as Eddie Brock who this time is investigating a serial killer, played by Woody Harrelson, whilst still Tryin to live his crazy life with Venom. The fun definitely comes from the interactions between Eddie & Venom & there's lots of fun moments & the two are a really nice team to watch on screen, so much so that i hope there's more Venom films in the works. Yes this Action-packed sequel works because of the Eddie & Venom relationship but it's also nice to see everyone else back again to help Eddie (his Ex & Dan) & this time their up against that serial killer when he escapes from Death Row with a new Symbiote inside of him called Carnage, a deadly Red one, & there's lots of Action & stunningly beautiful special effects. I enjoyed the scenes where Venom goes out alone without Eddie & ends up in Clubs & things. The villain is of course played by Woody Harrelson as Cletus Kasady, it's a pretty decent performance for what it is but it's also nothing particularly special as Woody feels miscast, he's not a strong enough presence to play the villain here & is zero intimidating or scary at all but that doesn't really matter because it's Carnage that is Awesome when he's on screen & i just love watching Eddie & Venom no matter who their fighting.Michelle Williams is very good again as Eddie's ex Anne & is such a strong actress & a welcomed presence. I still love the relationship between Eddie & his ex & her fiancee Dan. It's the fantastic look of Venom & Carnage that standout magnificently on screen & the end fight sequence is Awesome & very Gothic in style with it's abandoned church setting.Also a welcome surprise was the great British actor Stephen Graham as the main Detective of the film, that guy is a fantastic actor. Naomie Harris as another villain named Shriek who was ok in her part but nothing special.Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a faster paced movie than the first & with the characters we love so alot of fun to be had with this fun piece of Popcorn Blockbuster entertainment.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The film introduces Cletus Kasady (Harrelson) as a disturbed killer and his partner Frances (Harris) early on, before focusing on the odd-couple relationship of Venom/Eddie for the first act, which is quite fun. Anne (Williams) and Dan (Scott) are back as Eddie's ex and her new partner.Mulligan (Graham) is the cop trying to figure out what's going on with Eddie and has a link to Kasady & Frances. Besides Tom & Woody - both good to see having fun with their characters - no-one really gets much screen time, but things move along very quickly (only ~90min total), as the final showdown when Kasady becomes ""Carnage"" inevitably happens.Some solid CGI, which is required, but a poor soundtrack and a bit of a nothing plot. Feel like we needed more Dan & Mrs Chen (Lu) - the comedy aspects are done quite well and some of the action is good, but there's nothing really new or too exciting. End credits scene is worth waiting for.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

And the movie tries to communicate that without making it to on the nose about that ( but still being a few times).I liked the movie, I liked the lighthearted but important exploration into what is actually the relationship between Venom and Brock on a sentient level rather than just a biological one. I would have liked the delivery for it to be more subtle at least until the end where the direct approach would be good.I very much liked the way the Casady was portrayed ( I understand it is not close to the comics and all that...) and the human aspect of his relationship with Shriek the delivery here might have been a little bit better.But I also understand that the outside constraints of the movie where such that many things had to be toned down which is a pity as a much more serious approach to the ""gray area"" would have been welcome.The action is ok but mediocre, however it is in tone of the movie and I hope that in grand scheme of things this movie will fair better.But I did enjoy it and even if a bunch of things where on the nose and not really well executed I had fun watching various section.So yeah the movie might not be top of the line but don't let the negative views bother you too much, it is fun and campy in its own clumsy Brock way ^_^ and if you like Tom Hardy being all confused and somewhat cute with Venom and Woody Harrelson having a good but subdued performance this might be a fun one time watch.Also Dan is a cool guy.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

( another massive gamble risked on a ""comic book movie"" that fails once again, as why do they gamble? ).As when will film studios give ""super hero films"" the respect deserved.All they want to do is cash in on the hope of the audience that the film might be great, but end up letting down the audience with mediocrity.Like the first film ( to a lesser margin but still too many times ) there are scenes where characters in the scenes do not act or react like you can believably accept as an audience member. It takes you out of the film & you can't then truly enjoy the experience from start to end. Once again the special effects are top notch but are let down by another lazy script.We need quality character arcs ( with a bit of dark humour from Venom which there is in the movie, but could have been better still if the script overall was better as unfortunately the script got a bit too far fetched ).Venom could have been a truly great series of super hero movies as quite frankly if you would have had a proven Director & writer team like Jonathan Nolan ( writer ) & Christopher Nolan ( writer & Director ) make Venom & Venom 2 you would have had a 10 out of 10 film with Tom Hardy as the lead actor, however we did not get proven talent in the Director & writing roles for a blockbuster film so it ended up OK.Marvel unfortunately has been on a seriously bad decline since Disney got their hands on the franchise, as they really killed it off as compared to some of the absolute Marvel disasters at least Venom is still an OK watch however all these films had the potential to be a lot more than it proved they would be & that is simply because the corporations & the people with the power decided to put unproven Directors & writers in charge of these big budget films ( they gambled big, then lost big too ).","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Story is a conceptual mess. Okay editing. Some scenes are redundant or oddly out of place. Ok CGI. At times it made it hard to follow the action scenes. 4/10.On screen: Because of the script, the acting was bad all around. It seemed like Tom Hardy was just there to get each scene over with. Character decisions were questionable which made the acting unbelievable. Okay Cinematography. The lighting on the action scenes made it hard to follow. 2/10.Content/Impact: This movie could've had a serious message about the correlation between child abusive parents and its effect on people, which in this case would be the serial killer Cletus Kasady aka Carnage. Could have been controversial if they made the antagonist more sympathetic, it would have made a better, more believable character. This is so because in real life, people aren't all good or all bad. That complexity is what makes humans human and in this case would make the antagonist more believable. Lastly I don't understand why Naomie Harris, Shriek, takes these roles or the fact that the filmmakers still create these demeaning roles for black women in a predominantly Caucasian cast. In this film, also in the Pirates of the Caribbean movies she plays Tia Dalma aka Calypso, she plays a powerful black woman who is and can be controlled by her white counterparts. These filmmakers are perpetrating this stereotype that the only way black women can be powerful is to be controlled by white men. Throughout this movie she's told to shut her mouth and gets slapped around a lot. This Imaging just demeans black women and to let us know that black women are only here to provide servitude and are less than. 1/10.Overall: Terrible problematic movie. Only silver lining, if any, is the after credits scene. 2.3/10.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Now that isn't speaking too much volume to the movie itself, because it still suffers the same pacing issues the first one has.There are some pretty good moments scattered throughout the movie that stick out well and there are some things that probably should've been expanded upon more or had more in-depth coverage of. The action was improved much more compared to its predecessor and it looks great. The villain is awesome, and Woody Harrelson did a fantastic job of portraying Cletus Kassidy. Tom Hardy as usual has done a phenomenal job for both the voice and acting of Venom/Eddie Brock. I noticed complaints about Venom's voice but it wasn't all too different from his first film either.My main complaints that I found with the film was the lacking in Carnage's motivation/goals and the development overall. There were so much things that didn't stick out well for me with how Carnage was portrayed as a symbiote, and it just had me more so confused- similar to Venom's sudden change for staying on Earth from the first movie. The movie is incredibly fast, and burns through its short runtime giving the audience everything it has upfront. The best way to put it is the first hour of the movie contains the Eddie/Venom relationship, and the last half hour is Venom VS Carnage for the rest. Unfortunately, it just suffers the same pacing/writing issues that the first one has, but because of how chaotic and packed it is, it's much harder to see the poor pacing/writing.The movie overall is totally for fans of Venom and Carnage, it was never intended to be a down-to-Earth replica of the comic books and it was definitely not meant to be taken seriously, it's a fun movie nevertheless and it engages with the audience with its comedy and action scenes. It's a great time to watch the titular antihero go against his arch nemesis in cinema.I would recommend anyone to see it if they enjoyed the first Venom, but those that didn't really enjoy the first one probably won't see much of an improvement here other than some small updates made to the fights and relationships. The post credits scene is worth the film alone, but that to me is what takes away from the film in its entirety. The post credits scene is remarkable and probably one of the best post credits scenes we will ever witness, but it takes away the attention from the film itself. Regardless, Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a great action film full of mindless absurdity and chaos that will satisfy avid MCU and comic book fans for the vast majority.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The comedic chemistry between Eddie and Venom is the core of the film, resembling a romantic drama except they argue about eating human brains and the break-up involves literally infecting other human hosts. Anne, Dan and Mrs. Chen come along for the ride. However, the sequel is still let down by a rather unconvincing serial killer with not much charisma nor backstory.

People get mad at once upon a deadpool for being censored but if they had to do it that was the best way, same with this film, it gets more hate than it deserves. Let's start with the positives, the church fight is absolutely stunning with incredible shots and fight choreography. The part where carnage extends all of his tentacles out as he leaps towards venom is absolutely amazing (but still a little forced but it isn't really being forced if it looks awesome). The film's witty humour and interesting character relationships give it a high rating in my book. Now for the negatives, it's short runtime and occasional forced scenes and jokes set this back to a 7 from what would normally be a 9, however it still makes me belive in this song marvel universe, a cinematic universe shouldn't contain just a bunch of Batman v supermans and Tom cruise the mummys to set up everything and have people wait for the good stuff (which isn't really that good) but this doesn't do that and instead strives to create a good movie (until it's end credits scene that everyone says is the best part and the only good part but they're just biased toward, haha connected universe go brrrrrrr) and I think that's what they're trying to do with morbius as well, I hope the trend continues to kraven the hunter, I was a little scared with the whole ravencroft bit but after seeing the film, not to upset, I did wish for more screentime from shriek though, anyway I'm excited for the upcoming movies in this universe and I hope this review convinced you to see it in theatres.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

In fact, one could end up having a good time if one can vibe with its ridiculous aspects.Directed by Andy Serkis (Mowgli), the story is simple-minded and plays out as straightforward as possible. Serkis understands the strengths & limitations of the script and simply takes all that was silly & schlocky about the last entry and turns it up to 11, while also making sure it doesn't overstay its welcome by breezily pacing the events and wrapping the whole journey within 100 mins.With everything from visual effects to performances falling all over the place, the film finds its footing in the bromance unfolding between Eddie Brock & the alien symbiote. Among the new additions, Woody Harrelson surely has fun with his role. And on the narrative front, it is somewhat more focused than before but then it also keeps all the preposterous elements in tact to deliver the loony thrills.Overall, Venom: Let There Be Carnage brims with an unabashed charm & freshness that its predecessor lacked and makes for a big, dumb, silly & fun popcorn entertainer that viewers will either enjoy or not. It is well-aware of its boundaries, is more than happy to function within those constraints, and never tries to be anything more than that. Only minutely better but definitely more bearable than the previous chapter.","2 out of 21 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Venom: Let there be Silliness","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7530577/?ref_=tt_urv","MoviePeek","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur139667078/?ref_=tt_urv","9 November 2021","Venom Let there be Carnage marks the return of the titular gloopy goofball that was last seen in 2018's self-indulgently titled Venom. That outing saw the hulking black slime boy Venom go up against another symbiote who was a slightly different shade of black, charcoal? Grey maybe? He was a little lighter anyway. This made the climactic battle between these sloppy boys one of my least favourite finales featured in recent superhero movies. All in all, I wasn't a huge fan of the original, it came and went, and I haven't paid it much attention since.The sequel has one big thing going in its favor, that is this time around the villain is distinguishable from the protagonist due to his blood-red design. But having a villain that looks reasonably different from your main character does not a good film make, and with the influx of quality superhero movies of late, Venom Let there be Carnage is going to have to pull a rabbit out of a hat to compete. The good news is the sequel may not pull a rabbit from a hat, but it does perform a trick that is brisk and surprisingly amusing.Eddie and Venom are trying their best to live in harmony with one another, but this odd couple is struggling to share one body and find a lifestyle that suits them both. Eddie is trying to rebuild his career as a journalist and the story of notorious killer Cletus Kasady may be his ticket back into the big leagues. Of course, things take a turn for the worse when Kasady gets hold of a drop of Brocks blood, thereby transforming him from a deadly serial killer into a deadly serial killer with superpowers.Despite the darkness inherent in the premise, Venom Let there be Carnage is a surprisingly breezy and fun affair. That may come as a disappointment to some who were expecting a dark and shocking tale, but for me, it was a welcome change of pace. I genuinely had a good time with the first half of the film which never for a moment takes itself seriously and knows as much as the audience does, just what a silly premise this whole thing is. This allows the sequel to up the gag count and focuses on slapstick old-fashioned jokes at the expense of Venom and Eddie.This is what I liked about the film most, and far more than in the original, here it is clear that Tom Hardy is having a good time playing the character, particularly the Venom symbiote whose deep strange voice was able to deliver some of the films most amusing moments. This is of course is a departure from the original, which frankly took itself far too seriously. Remember that moment when Eddie jumps in the lobster tank and starts tucking in? Well, the sequel is way way way more of that.So, the film delivers plenty of laughs, but unfortunately when the film isn't focusing on the Brock/Venom relationship things are decidedly less interesting. None of it is by any means awful, but it's dumb and sloppy.Cletus Kasady gets a decent amount of screen-time and the film admirably tries to give him a sympathetic backstory and more human motivations that the audience can relate to, but it doesn't really come together. On the one hand, the film portrays him as an unhinged nut-job, but on the other as a tragic figure. At no point did I feel sympathy for Kasady or relate to him, however, he was fun to watch. Woody Harrelson returns from the first film and now sports a red wig that does not look laughable. Harrelson chews up the scenery like no one else and tries his best to make Carnage three-dimensional, but if nothing else he succeeded in making Cletus entertaining.However, Carnage isn't the only bad guy Venom has to deal with this time around, as Cletus has teamed up with his old sweetheart, Frances Barrison aka Shriek. She inexplicably has super scream powers, a gift she has had since birth. The film makes no attempt to explain these powers, and it doesn't make a whole of sense, but hey-ho just run with it. She and her beloved and his newfound gloopy pal are out to paint the town red (with blood) and rekindle their love. Shriek was by no means complex or three-dimensional, but she was fun and the conflict between her and the Carnage symbiote was interesting and gave the trio a conflicted and complex dynamic.Where so many films try to build a cinematic universe of set up sequels and spin-offs, Venom Let there be Carnage tells a surprisingly focused and intimate narrative that expands on the best parts of the first film. The film is junk food, it's not good for you and you probably shouldn't enjoy it as much as you do. It's a dumb silly movie that never takes itself too seriously. Its brisk and breezy nature may leave some fans enraged, but for me, it was a vast improvement on its predecessor and delivered a surprising number of laughs. A film like this is a welcome change of pace, and there is more than enough room for big superhero movies, as well as smaller goofier gloopier ones too.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This is not fully one of those superhero-action fight-em ups- or maybe even meant to be one of those in the first place. This...This is a romantic comedy.The first Venom had Eddie Brock growing to care for the creature taking up residence in his headspace and leaving him floundering in a lobster tank. There was all of build-up between these two characters, a lot of tension, some character growth, all this talk of compatibility-And now we finally got to see two absolute train-wrecks figure out their place in the world and in each others lives. Is it good? I mean, it's a super-hero action movie rom-com, so I would temper your expectations to a low boil. Is it fun?

When you learn to right a story you have a beginning, middle and end, they forgot that part.Unsure why they'd rush it, so either they did it to fulfill contracts or just had no ideas, there was no real story here, it was easily the worst story I've ever seen in marvel, it felt like 30 mins too short, just ended, killed stories dead, was just like, dead, bye, generic ending leaving another sequel as an opportunity.Woody was horrible in this, I'm shocked to say that but he was so bad. They should kill this dead now, the first was mediocre and this killed any buzz for this character.The only way they could save this is to tie in another franchise, venom should never be a stand alone again as they've proven here they have no ideas, passion for the character or interest in making a deep world for brock to inhabit, such a surprise but this after that awful ten ring film has me worried that the future of anything outside the home run franchises are not going to be as good .Personally the only way to resuscitate venom for me is one character and that's deadpool, possibly Spider-Man but I think style wise a venom deadpool colab is the only way this character ever has a chance of being relevant or exciting again.I liked the magazine cameo for Stan Lee but I fear now he's gone that there's a real hole in the quality in these films, was Stan the heart?Anyway don't waste your money on this.

Marvel doesn't take Venom character serious in the movie, so this movie gets 6/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Surprisingly the Woody Harralson side of the story was by far the worst part. Overacting, cringe lines... Etc. The overall plot was rushed and cut up. I'm not sure if this movie was supposed to be longer and it was condensed but this may be a movie that improves with a directors cut that adds like 30 more minutes. The action is decent with decent CGI. Jokes landed 50 percent of the time and Tom Hardy stole the show.

What this movie did better than the first one was that it developed the villain more than the first one but in its only 1 hour 37 minuet run time it seemed a little rushed. If the movie was not so focused on making jokes similar to that of Deadpool but less funny, they could have developed the story/characters. The villains did have cool powers though.What infuriated me most is that they still don't explain how Venom dies in the first movie and then suddenly appears inside Eddie's body in the next scene.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Not the greatest piece of cinema in the world, it was never trying to be genre defining or anything like that, just a damn good time. This is just a really good, fun, exciting time at the cinema.....shove a huge handful of popcorn in your mouth and enjoy the ride!!I will admit I was a little hesitant about a sequel to ""Venom"", it could go either one of two ways. One, be a warranted sequel that expands the story/world or Two, just be a cash cow!! Thankfully in this case ""Venom: Let There Be Carnage"" is most definitely the first scenario..........well ok maybe a little bit of both haha.Tom Hardy (Eddie) and the relationship he has with Venom is once again the main attraction of the film. It is written so so well, fantastic comedic elements that actually have you laughing aloud. (Which sadly even some comedies actually struggle to do). Picks up right from where we left off with them having banter and arguments together is simply brilliant !!I'd also mention that Michelle Williams and Tom Hardy have a great chemistry on screen. Their story in the first film felt so believable because of this and once again they thrive of one another performances.Directing, action, story and CGI are all on a good level and actually feel as if the people behind it really cared about the product.Sadly though there are a couple of parts that don't work that well for me personally. Firstly Woody Harrelson, just doesn't really suit this film to me. I love the guy I think he is a terrific actor but I'm not sure he was cast correctly in this. His performance isn't awful or distracting, its just I feel someone else could have fitted it better. That also goes for Naomie Harris, it just doesn't seem to fit to me. Again she wasn't awful or bad, I just didn't think she was best suited to this. Neither of these complaints are really really negative, just a bit of a nitpick.Overall this film did exactly what I wanted it to do. Don't trash all the good work that was set up in the first film and actually try and expand the story/world of the film. 65% out of 100 its a average/good film just like the first one. Its perfectly fine and does its job, nothing sensational about it but then again it didn't need to be!!!!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Introduce a bad guy and every good guy or anti heroes unite their power to bring down bad guy/s.The only thing that can surprise the audience is the mid post-credit scene and I won't write anything about it but it was an important mid credits for the future of Venom.This is the second movie directed by Andy Serkis that I have seen and I don't think he has done a bad job. I'm not gonna mention much about actings but apart from protagonists, Stephen Graham did a very good job as detective Mulligan.I really liked the relationship between Eddie Brock and Venom and this relationship leads to some funny scenes in the movie. The relationship was the strongest aspect of the movie.There are some things I didn't like in the movie.First of all, Villain was not so effective, it was just there to challenge the hero.The other side characters don't have appropriate character developments, they are just there to serve hero or villain. There were some illogical mistakes but since it is a superhero movie you just can ignore them for example, symbiote finds a character's place just uploading itself to the computer, how is that possible I didn't get it. Since the movie doesn't take itself so seriously these illogical situations can be ignorable.Briefly, It's like the first movie but this movie is not an origin story so you can expect more from the sequel but don't expect it because you can easily be disappointed.It is not better than the first movie, just don't ignore illogical situations because the movie is so superficial and not detailed. By lowering my expectations I enjoyed the movie and had a fun time. If you like superhero movies you'll enjoy it but don't expect much and don't forget to watch mid-credit scene. Until you see the mid-credit scene you shouldn't leave the theater.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

To be straightforward, this sci-fi action sequel doesn't deserve the hate it's receiving. Fans who loved the 2018 predecessor's action and character focus will likely be pleased in what this one has to offer.First of all, the film grabs our attention at the start and lets us know a little information about the antagonists. The pacing is charming, but not so pleasing when the next 30 minutes portray what's happening at the moment with Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and alien-like companion, Venom.Surprisingly, there's a frequent sense of comedic fashion throughout the new events. Seriously, there's small but fruitful touches with jokes that'll actually give you a solid laugh. Unsurprisingly, Let There Be Carnage brings us back to the enjoyable science fiction-themed action sequences involving Eddie Brock and Venom vs. The antagonist, Cletus Kasady. It's really witty to witness Woody Harrelson as Kasady.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Everything about this movie seems rushed and not taken into consideration about the portrayal of their characters sure the cast do their part even woody did a good job with portrayal of Cletus but the carnages voice doesn't match his intent. Overall I'm hoping that Sony/Marvel should at least consider how fans feel before making a rash decision like this. Good design bad portrayal.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Unfortunately Venom 2 did not have an engaging or Compelling story and I was very hyped for this movie. I will say that the CGI was great and the fight scenes were amazing. The story focuses way to much on Eddie and Venoms relationship it makes them turn into a couple who constantly argue with with each. The movie had a great villain with Carnage and but the secondary villain was really boring with not a lot of scenes or character development. Not only were the villains quite boring but the side characters too. Fans of the MCU will like the post credit scene tho!As always Tom Hardy plays Eddie and Venom to perfection. Woody Harrelson plays Carnage and he was really good playing the psychopath but doesn't get a lot to do in the movie. Stephen Graham plays the most boring side character I have ever seen he was underused and has no character development at all.Overall the movie could have been way better but unfortunately it ended up being one of the worst sequel movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is an absolute necessity because its huge.These Venom movies are really hard to critique because as a movie it really shouldn't work. I hate Tom Hardy, I don't like Michelle Williams and was never a fan of Venom. So it absolutely baffles me that these 3 are the sole reason that I enjoyed both these movies. The chemistry between Eddie, Anne and Venom is a ticketseller. I mean I struggle to think of other superhero movies with such a naturally funny chemistry than these 3.I'm still not sure if I liked the previous movie or even this one but I just know that I had tons of fun watching it. Venom is actually a love story not a superhero action film, when you think it like it makes perfect sense. The newest addition Cletus was an absolute spot on cast, Woody Harrelson really nails the deranged monster Kasady is in the comics. Carnage looked cool and brutal, just how he is supposed to be.But this isn't a good movie, it was extremely rushed, had pathetic pacing, little to no cohesivity, bonkers direction and poor technical showcase. I had no idea this movie was even out, almost no marketing was done for it seems. It was criminally short and Cletus was woefully underused. This movie is the very definition of a frantic mess with barely any substance. The only likable part of the movie as I said were the interactions between Eddie, Venom and Ann. Exactly like the previous one and thus gets the same score as the previous one too.Watch it but have absolutely zero expectations. Watch it for the accurate casting of Cletus and Eddie-Venom-Ann. But most importantly watch it for the mid credit scene. There is no way you're gonna hate that, trust me.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Now, Venom 2 certainly understands it's a comic book movie (and it's refreshing). The film's pace is lightning, brisk; zero time for exposition. You want to understand the characters more? Go watch the first film.Regardless, this movie was great to watch after a stressful day at work. Were any of the scenes particularly memorable? Not really (albeit I did find Carnage weirdly horrifying). Was it poignant? Nope. But it was fun, and did not bore me. I have to respect the effort. It was entertaining, and sometimes that's all I need.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

He's much more into the marvel universe than I am. Seems like he enjoyed it; I enjoyed eating the popcorn (at first).From what I gather, the plot follows venom/eddie, a chaotic-good anti-hero duo, as they try to lead a ""normal"" life in a not so normal world. Since marvel movies are cookie cutter, I kind of knew where this movie was headed, but after a while, it started to remind me of another movie: Inside Out.!! SPOILERS !!: Inside Out is about a young girl dealing with depression. The movie represents her emotions using personas (one for sadness, anger, happiness, etc.) which are little beings living inside her head that talk to each other. The movie uses the conversations between the emotions as a way to guide the girl's emotions (and by extension, the audience). What I liked about Inside Out was it wasn't afraid to tackle tough issues. Even though the movie was made for children, I was still able to relate to it, as a grown man, and it left an impression on me.So what does this have to do with venom? Well, venom is essentially eddie's alter ego. He serves the same purpose as an imaginary friend, being there for eddie when he's at his lowest. He's there to talk to eddie when no one else will. Mental health is an important subject, and men's mental health is often ignored. I thought, for a second, that this movie would actually go there, that eddie would actually talk about his problems and venom might help him get through it. I was about to get interested in the film...but nope.... it was back to the noise.Unfortunately, movie execs don't like taking risks and prefer falling back to the tried and tested formula of entertaining people: lots of fights, action, little talking and cliffhangers for the next run-of-the-mill film.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

I was expecting a decent movie at best. This movie managed to exceed my expectations! I am apparently in the minority since I actually liked the first movie. Sure, the first one was a tad dull, but I still liked it. Now, this one just left me at the edge of my seat the whole way through! Much like the first movie, the CGI was phenomenal! The action for sure didn't disappoint. The set design was amazing. The movie was dark and gritty, but it definitely had its moments of heart and humor. Tom Hardy gave a good performance and Eddie Brock/Venom, but Woody Harrelson really stood out as Cletus Kasady/Carnage. I mean, who doesn't love a good villain?! He was deranged, charismatic, and just all-around fun to watch. My main complaint is just the sheer amount of language in this film! The writers must have the mouths of sailors! My other complaint was that I wasn't big on the character of Frances Barrison/Shriek, who was played by Naomie Harris. To me, she just felt like an attempt at the famous relationship of Joker and Harley Quinn. Also, She-Venom made a once again unnecessary return. This end of my review may sound like me just bashing the movie, but I'm really not trying to rip it to shreds. I am just showing what kept this movie from being a ten-star film in my eyes. Let me also add that the post-credits scene left me and the rest of the theater very excited!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Fine Follow Up to the Original. Features Two Great Characters","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8934464/?ref_=tt_urv","Reviews_of_the_Dead","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23318905/?ref_=tt_urv","17 March 2023","This was a movie that I saw the trailer at the theater when I was with Jaime and I told her how excited I was. It is interesting though is that I'm late to seeing this, almost two years later. If a film isn't horror, it is difficult for me to find time at the theater. That is even for one of my favorite comic book antiheroes and villain. Regardless, I finally checked this out.We are picking this up where the last one left off. Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) visits Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) in prison. The latter is a serial killer and Eddie is the only person he will talk to. This puts our lead on bad terms with Detective Mulligan (Stephen Graham) because he doesn't understand why. Cletus is cryptic in what he says to Eddie though. I did want to say that the change in hair here was noticeable since I watched this back-to-back with the original. Doesn't ruin it, but I digress.There is also back-story of Cletus. He was kept at a school with Frances Barrison (Naomie Harris) with whom he loved. She has a superpower that allows her to do a supersonic shriek. This also becomes her name.Venom is back with Eddie and he notices drawings on the walls of the cell where Cletus is kept. Through this, they learn where the bodies of Cletus' victims are. This causes the governor to re-instate the death penalty for Cletus. Eddie is invited to watch. Things get heated with Eddie getting too close, Cletus biting him and blood getting into his mouth. This causes an interesting change in our villain and a form of the symbiote meshing to him. Carnage is created and wreaks havoc like this name insinuates.Where I want to start then is that I think this is a good follow up. We are picking up as I said where the last leaves off. Anne Weying (Michelle Williams) is back. She doesn't know for sure if Venom is still with Eddie or not. Their relationship gets even more estranged though when she becomes engaged to Dr. Dan Lewis (Reid Scott). There is also more character development as Venom has a fallout with his host as well.Then from there, let me go to Cletus and Carnage. I think that they handle this well. It is interesting to see how violent we go while still keeping that PG-13 rating. It is impressive to be honest. Harrelson makes a good Cletus in my opinion. I'd also say that the rest of the cast is also good. Hardy, Williams, Harris and Graham are all the best performances with the rest of the cast rounding this out for what was needed.There is a gripe that I have here though. This leans too much into the comedy. There are things that just took me out of the movie as they're playing it for laughs. I don't know if they're trying to capture what Deadpool did or what, but I wasn't a fan. It is a shame though as this is well-made. The lower run time from the earlier is good. The effects are solid. It goes heavy CGI, but I think the budget works there. They have Venom, Carnage and Shriek do things that would be difficult to do practically. I'm on board for most of what we're doing here. The tone is just off for me.In conclusion, I'd still recommend this. I love what they're doing to tie this in with Spider-Man and the rest of the MCU. That has me intrigued. I still enjoy my time here watching two of my favorite comic book characters facing off.My Rating: 7 out of 10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

When they announced the second chapter I was very excited only for the presence of Carnege, already from the trailer I noticed a lack of care in the CGI but I thought that maybe they still had to work on it. Unfortunately this was not the case, the duration already made me doubt, but the dress does not make the monk. I go to the cinema without any expectations, when I came out I was very sad. I have never seen a film worse than this, the dialogue is nonsense, the action scenes are incomprehensible and I was really disappointed with the scene after the credits. Not to mention Carnage, very badly done and meaningless. Finally I can only say that there cannot be a film about Carnage without a small drop of blood, truly shameful.

My only issue with this film is its runtime - I need to see more fights.Let There Be Carnage continues where Venom left off, and it's a great start to an already notorious anti-hero. The best part, however, is it continues this path while keeping in mind our social values and expectations need to be addressed to truly hit the best note. Venom begins to get a personality (aside from a lousy pun-cracking monster) and explores himself and who he is in the context of Earth and humanity. As Venom acquires these desires, they get in the way of Eddie's goals and this strife allows for both characters to evolve and develop in their own ways. As always, our hero will come out on top and the same goes for Venom and Eddie, though this time around they have a stronger relationship that's built on more than just power and an semi-obligation to protect the world from ""eevil"".I take that back - no, not the good stuff about the movie but the thing where I said ""something something one thing I didn't like""; I've actually got two. Twined together with the runtime is the actual narrative and character development, which took a slight beating from only getting an hour and thirty-odd minutes to go from zero-to-antihero. We only see a snippet of Venom's development and Eddie's outlook on the world becoming more aligned with his goals, and that's not enough to really flesh these guys out. If only this were at least two hours long and R-rated - that'd be the cherry on top of the cherry, which also happens to be on top of another cherry.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Imagine watching a Deadpool movie, without Deadpool, it's PG13 and about 20 minutes have clearly been edited out. Also, take all the background music and editing techniques from a 90s, live-action Batman movie, include all the action and CGI in the trailers (because you've already seen it all) and you get this movie. It mostly feels like a mash of Hollywood tropes older audiences have seen countless times.With that said, what carries this movie are the characters. It's so entertaining watching the relationship between Eddie and Venom grow throughout these movies. The banter and dialogue is surprisingly well done and most of the jokes in these scenes are funny. So yes, oddly enough, the best part of this movie is the comedy between Eddie and Venom.All the actors do a serviceable job, but we really only care about Venom, Carnage and their human counter-parts. Although, Ms. Chen is a very lovable character. I actually want to see her return. I will say, Woody really leans into the cheesiness of his character. That Batman reference wasn't random, he feels like a villain from a 90s, live-action Batman movie. The only thing missing from his protroyal were cringey one-liners.This is basically a great movie being held back by too many things. When Carnage came onscreen a lot of the action felt sanitized and heavily edited, then I remembered that this is PG13. You're going to ""Let there be Carnage!"" without an R-rating? It makes no sense. I also think Andy Serkis wanted to make this movie feel like a Saturday morning cartoon from the 90s. Well...he accomplished that. So if that's what you're expecting, you'll probably give this a higher score.I was also hoping for more action scenes I haven't already seen. This movie would be much more enjoyable if you haven't seen all the trailers. There is a ""surprise"" mid-credits scene but honestly, just have a friend tell you what it is. You should just wait to watch this on streaming.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I found the banter between Brock and his symbiote to be more wearing than entertaining and the conclusion a CGI constructed mess. I liked this sequel a little more, but I wouldn't go as far as saying that I thought it was good.Whilst interviewing serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson), some of Eddie Brock's (Tom Hardy) symbiotic blood is introduced to Kasady's system. This goes on to generate Carnage, a powerful red symbiote charged with the psychosis of its host. Escaping from prison, Carnage tries to rescue Kasady's long term girlfriend Francis Barrison (Naomie Harris) and then find a way to get their revenge on Brock. However, Brock and Venom are not finding life together particularly copacetic.I really wanted to get there this time, to like this one. I like Andy Serkis, I like how committed to playing the character Tom Hardy is, acting as a producer this time and getting his friend Kelly Marcel to return to write the film with him. I liked the cameo roles for British actors, Rosie Marcel, Scroobius Pip and most high profile, Reece Shearsmith, in a role that was a real surprise, as I don't think he's talked about it anywhere.But I just didn't manage it. The bickering between Brock and Venom is rarely (but not never) funny, and again becomes tiresome quite a lot of the time. There's a lot or praise for the tight runtime, but I felt that came at the expense of the story, which is really basic and leads to the under utilisation of several characters - most notably Naomie Harris' Shriek villain, who appears retrofitted into the story to make the conclusion work. I understand the change in Carnage's origins, in order to differentiate the film from the first one, but I didn't like it. The CGI work isn't particularly amazing and the final fight has been done before.The post credits scene was intriguing, but for me, I'm as excited that the character can get into the hands of better storytellers, as for the actual reveal of it.","13 out of 29 found this helpful.

There was so much potential and I feel like I could have been great if it was 20-30 minutes longer and there was more time to let the story develop. The first venom was almost 2 hours long. This one from beginning to credits was around 80 minutes. Too short for how much was going on. I hate giving low ratings but I was so disappointed. Honestly the best part of the whole movie happened during the end credits. The acting was alright. Woody Harrelson was excellent and really one of the only redeeming factors in this movie. I know It is a ""super hero"" movie and they are predictable, but this was beyond predictable. Within the first 5 minutes of this film, combined with knowledge from the trailer, I knew exactly what was going to happen in the movie. I hate being disappointed.

It was what was. A rated R comic book film with a more black comedic edge. Not bad, but not terribly memorable. Now with Venom: Let There Be Carnage we get more of the same only this ti e the film goes for pure camp. It has virtually no story. The villain, Cleatus Kasaday which turns into Carnage is played with over the top glee by Woody Harrelson. He is a serial killer on death row that wants to give Eddie an exclusive interview and reveal certain facts about his murders. He bites Eddie at one point thus ingesting a small part of Venom so he becomes a red symbiote. Carnage. More or less we know the rest. Most of the film which us pretty short at about 90 minutes spends most of its running time with Eddue and Venom's back and forth banter that was also present in the first film. It's funny at times but becomes repetitive. Michelle Williams is back as Anne, Eddie's ex fuance who shows up to tell Eddie she is engaged. All of this comes to a head once Carnage shows up. Venom separates from. Eddie after an argument and tries to join with other humans but they all die. Eventually these two rejoin to fight Carnage. It's all done with the typical CGI pyrotechnics and it us entertaining but the film is so jokey and light that you don't really care about what's happening on screen. Woody Harrelson is funny but not really menacing as Cletus. So really no sense of danger or stakes to be memorable. The first film was better in that at least there was some semblance of plot and stakes for the characters.Uninspired sequel.Grade: C.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Did they hire middle schoolers to write this movie? Do they even care about the plot or do they just want to cling to MCU as soon as possible?Yes, Venom itself was funny at times in this movie, but that's not the Venom I want to see. Just because a movie made you laugh a couple of times, it doesn't make it good movie.The CGI fights are as weightless and boring as the last movie.The movies rushes everything and has a 2000's B Movie superhero writing.Hey Sony, if you're not gonna give Marvel the rights to Spider-Verse, then be it, have fun with it, just please don't bring your horribly-written movies into the MCU and get Spidey back from Marvel after No Way Home and make your Sony-Verse so we don't have to watch it, PLEASE stay away from the MCU.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

If they only went in with an R-rating instead of this PG-13 crap. For serious, A film that stars two mighty lethal and ferocious beasts like Venom & Carnage; not having an R-rating should be deemed as an act of foolishness, period.I know the approach in the first part was pretty similar, however in that case, I could say it was still moderately reasonable. Simply cause that film was cited more like an Origin Story than anything else and it also was in search of a strong base of audience. There, PG-13 makes a lot of sense! But now when they've got what they wanted, this time with the sequel, specifically with Carnage in there, it should have been bestowed with nothing but Gore & Violence.Without those vital characteristics, Venom 2 rather feels like unfinished work. Seems like the makers didn't even care to bring it to its fullest potential! The story is half-baked, the editing is anything but crispy, even the CGI; which was supposed to play a comparatively greater role, looked nasty in places.As for the characters; well, what can I say? It's just that, besides Venom & Eddie; others had little to no significance. Sadly, this involves Carnage as well, shocking right? I know! Given the buzz and all the anticipations surrounding this exotic symbiote; I'm sorry to say his portrayal didn't live up to the hype.The sole highlight and probably the only saving grace here is the Humour and of course this odd yet promising Dynamic in-between Venom & Eddie. They made me laugh out loud at times as well as hit just the right strands of sentiments in a few.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's like the first part, with its half-dead idea and very cowardly implementation, only now the number 2 is in the title. Not to say that there were expectations, but still the interest was encouraging - maybe they would really take a concept with an antihero forced to devour villains, give it an adult rating and spice it up with the incredible charisma of Woody Harrelson? Besides, what a cool opportunity to dissect the brain of a psychopathic maniac through the prism of his relationship with the symbiote.In general, there was somewhere to roam... It didn't work out. Or rather, they didn't want to do anything. They wanted to rivet a boring video sequence with a sad Tom Hardy, not really trying to act out some emotions, a flat Woody with an even flatter motivation, some screaming witch and a typical superhero girlfriend. Oh, yes, there is also a voiceover 'humorist' for the audience and hilarious sketches of conflicts directly between Venom and Hardy. In short, it's just boring, insipid and not interesting.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The first act doesn't have anything substantial happening, and when we get to the second, there's way too much going on. The pacing is all over the place, only broken by a few interesting scenes, such as the one where Venom attends a rave party. The humor hasn't improved drastically as yet, and the main baddie - Carnage (and his human counterpart Cletus, a serial killer) played by Woody Harrelson) - is almost caricature-like. If you expect Harrelson's Cletus to be one of those fascinating psychopaths, then you're probably in for the wrong movie. Nope, this ain't Natural Born Killers. The writing by Kelly Marcel (who wrote the first film) sticks to familiar narrative beats, tucking in not one but two fun jailbreak scenes.I found Carnage's design to be a bit weak. The differentiations lie in the colors and the tentacles; that's sufficient to make the climactic showdown (set in a church, with the church bell having a pivotal role to play) very vibrant. It also sucks that for a film that has too many lines mentioning chewing people's heads off, we don't get to see either Venom or Carnage pull that off in a satisfyingly gory way (yes, I'm looking at that damn PG-13 rating). There's a mid-credits scene that should send almost everyone into a frenzy, and that portion gets a double thumbs-up. The odd dynamic between Eddie and Venom is surprisingly given more weight in the film, and it's safe to say that the sequel has managed to avoid a reiteration of some of the original's poor one-liners. The bottom line here is that the film doesn't take itself seriously, and neither should you!","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

So I was really looking forward to the sequel. Now, I know sequels are notoriously difficult, they usually need to surpass the first to be really noteworthy, and this one objectively almost had it, but kinda missed the mark.I think the problem was it was trying to concentrate on too many plots at the same time. His relationship with Venom, his relationship with Michelle Williams' character, then her relationship with her fiance, the back story of the antagonist, the antagonists girlfriend, the present danger. It just felt kinda diluted because it didn't have the time to develop any of these enough to get you properly invested. So I watched the movie sort of wondering which was the part that was important? And it did become confusing. It sort of felt like the writers knew the whole story, then wrote the screenplay assuming the audience knew what they did.Don't get me wrong, it was still enjoyable, just a little disappointing.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film explored and made it seem to point out that the two are essentially mutual existence by that point. There were some parts though that while made sense is a little let down. The motivations of its villains are quite confusing, too. For some reason Cletus wants to kill Eddie, but towards the end his actual reason for coming to Eddie was quite the opposite. Carnage on the other hand wants to kill Venom for seemingly no particular reason. While it is true that the stakes in the conflict are more personal, the fast pacing of the film made these motivations not relatable. While saying the plot is not the film's strongest suit, it is still pretty decent and enjoyable. There are many moments of fun courtesy of the banter between Eddie and Venom. The action is what was expected from a comic book movie. It was flashy and certainly violent though to a lesser degree compared to other films. Most of the fights were CGI. Did it look cool? Yes it did, but big CGI fights are common nowadays in many superhero films so that one is again expected. As to the performances Tom Hardy certainly delivers the mess that is Eddie Brock. With or without Venom, Tom Hardy's Eddie is a fun character. Woody Harrelson also fit the role of Cletus just perfectly. It is unfortunate though that the other cast members were not fully utilized. Overall, Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a decent superhero thing which is not a bad thing. It could have been better but still decent.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Firstly because of the promise that one of Marvel's most popular villains was finally getting a big screen debut, and secondly that Woody Harrelson had been cast in the part.I said before this film that Harrelson has been in some films that were not great, but I have yet to see him turn in a bad performance.This is true here. With limited background included in the script his performance is energetic and outlandish enough to capture the heart of the character, but not enough time or focus is given to him to really show the level of threat the character has always had.In terms of the title character, Hardy returns where we left him as ""looser"" Eddie Brock who is having issues with his intrusive room mate.The back and forth between Eddie and Venom that was popular in the first film returns. The humour mostly lands but it does feel like the troupe is a little overused at times.The plot is pretty simplistic, and could have been so much richer giving better service to its two leads and a criminally underused Naomie Harris. The story is restricted and seems to have been sacrificed for a shorter screen time.This is a movie that promised and lot, but the delivery left me wanting more, and not in a way that I wanted it too.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Let there be Carnage is more humorous which is alright, but it feels like it was trying too hard to be interesting when it was fine the first time.

Also they tried doing a little too much and the humor was more forced and ultimately did not work. In this sequel, the film was very short and everything happens pretty quickly. It doesn't stall and has a quick build up to the finale battle.Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock is great again and here we see more of the chemistry and friendship with him and Venom. The back and forth and bickering is some of the highlights as the voice and overall mannerisms of Venom shine. Woody Harrelson is solid enough as Carnage and the back story works.Let there be Carnage is quite easily better than the original yet for some reason it has a lesser IMDB rating (5.9 to 6.6). Do not understand much of the backlash received from the fans for this film, it is entertaining, humorous and straight forward. Although somewhat of a predictable storyline where certain parts feel rehashed from other comic films. However people seemed to have taken the film a little too serious.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, it's a rocky relationship, to say the least. Brock also attempts to revive his career by interviewing Cletus Kasady, a serial killer who doesn't trust anyone else. But things go wrong when Cletus also gets infected with a deadly and bloodthirsty symbiote. Brock must quickly find a way to work with Venom and deal with the Carnage brought on by Kasady.Although the plot is pretty straightforward for a comic-book flick, the banter between Brock and Venom is often the film's most fascinating element. Brock is constantly trying to quench Venom's thirst for, well, HUMANS! Leading to some amusing exchanges - even if the humour doesn't land always.Nevertheless, Tom Hardy's performance with the CGI character carries the film through some rough patches. Like Hardy, Woody Harrelson fully embraces the film's quirky, often absurd tonality and certainly enjoys playing the antagonist. Together, they make some of the apparent plot holes easier to ignore.Anne Weying (Michelle Williams), Francis Barrison (Naomie Harris) and Patrick Mulligan (Stephen Graham). They have potentially intriguing roles but don't get much development beyond some hasty plot beats and they end up being the story's weakest links. In addition, the editing is shady in places, indicative of significant trimming, perhaps the right decision.The action is easy to follow and looks great in 3D without being overbearing. While the film meets the basic requirements for comic-book movie enjoyment, its most essential sequence is the post-credit scene that raises the bar for the Venom character.Not only does it change the scope for where he and Eddie Brock will show up next, but it also makes this problematic yet oddly entertaining sequel more than worthwhile.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Or how doing that would create a symbiote so much stronger than Venom?2) The film definitely rushes through a lot of the exposition - for example Cletus' origin is explained through a little post card that he writes for Eddie
3) Bringing back Anne and Dan from the first film was a nice touch, but did feel largely unnecessary as they don't really have any purpose in the film and it's a bit unbelievable that Anne and Eddie would still be friends when Anne is now with Dan.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I love Tom Hardy, but I do not love this flick. I do like it, though. The humor is not QUITE cringe inducing, the visuals work if you convince yourself you came to watch a cartoon anyway, but the actors are swell. In this story two symbiotes duke it out while dragging their human ""hosts"" along for the ride/fight. They are powerful aliens who can be brought down with fire and/or sound. Other than that you have to be crafty to get the upper hand with these guys, and emotions play a large part.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

The only thing that made this film better for me was Carnage, and even then since the film isn't R rated; Carnage doesn't feel as impactful as he should've been.Woody Harrelson did fine in the role, since I feel like he was at least trying with his character. I still don't like Tom Hardy as Eddie Brock, he looks like Eddie but to me he's still not acting like Eddie, because he's still too likeable. This film is also too short, since the last act is so rushed and it makes me think that they cut out 20 or 30 mins of footage, leaving us with only one Venom vs Carnage fight, which is disappointing.Shriek also sucks, she's race swapped for no reason and her character is boring, even worse she's shoe horned into Cletus's backstory which just doesn't work. The action is fine, Venom and Carnage look good visually, but this could've been a great film; if Sony grew some balls and made this a bloody R rated massacre movie.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

His ex's boyfriend did more to resolve the plot. The Chinese shopkeeper did more to resolve the plot.Eddie Brock was absolutely and utterly useless this entire time, getting dragged along, his issues with Venom resolved by his ex and getting one-sidedly beaten by a 60year old Woody Harrelson during the short windows when he was the one fighting.The only time during this entire movie when he contributed was when he reminded Venom that they have the power of friendship on their side and that's why they can win.The character progression in the second movie was essentially the first movie all over again, ending on the same ""we had issues, but we're partners now"" note, but when you see the same thing twice, the second time is inevitably going to be less impactful.Venom 2 was still a pretty decent watch, only this time without the ""cool"" moments i enjoyed in the first one.

Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson are great in the movie. There's also this cop character in the movie that interacts with Tom Hardy Oh, I thought he was great in the movie and I was honestly wanting to see you more of him interacting with Tom Hardy then Tom Hardy interacting with Venom. Well the CGI is not great I thought it was well Incorporated most of the time which is a big plus from the first movie for me. I thought all the storylines we're very interesting and I thought that the Carnage portion of the movie was pretty cool for a PG-13 version of this character. But to be honest I'm sad to say that the movie is just okay. The biggest problem with the movie is the runtime oh, it is way too short. There are plenty of moments in the movie that feel like the studio took chunks out of the movie and left you with a photo real. You also never feel like anyone other than Tom Hardy and then I'm good character development which really sucks because I think the introduction lead you to believe that this movie is going to be really awesome. I feel like I'm honestly if they were to switch out all of these stories this would have been a great movie. And I can't help but Wonder did the studio come in and tell them to chop off a lot of this movie because it's very noticeable in the scenes then there was supposed to be a little bit more then what they are showing. I also feel like this movie was supposed to be rated R but the studio told them to make it PG-13 probably due to covid. I really do feel bad for the team that worked on this movie because I feel like the final product did not do justice to the movie.

I'd recommend him to consider staying as an actor because this did wrong to the actors and the rest of the crew that came up with this rubbish.The story, oh yes. What story?

So i think this film is not too surprising..

They tried way too hard with all the comedy nonsense and make him a ""hero"". Thought end of Venom 1 had established he was no hero but guess they took a step back only to recycle the whole ""hero or no hero"" thing in this movie. It was wack.Thought Carnage/Woody Harrison were great. Marvel's Black Canary *shriek* was great too. Until they found some bs way to make them lose lol. But besides that, they were definitely the best part of the movie.This movie being PG-13 kinda set it back, though I think at least they *tried* not to make it too obvious they didn't want to show blood, since the movie in general was dark and there were still dead bodies all over the place. Unlike Shang-Chi were 2 mini-armies go at each other and someone no one gets so much as a cut.Finally, with mid-credit scene, Venom is officially part of the MCU. Looking forward to see how that will be handled.All in all, 7/10 may watch again, which is 1 point higher than I gave Shang-Chi at least.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I enjoyed the first movie, I would give it a solid 6/10, it was entertaining but Venmo 2 made Venmo 1 look like a masterpiece! It was so horribly bad I don't know where to start. First the writing feels like it has schizophrenia, it's all over the place! It's like two writers sat in different rooms, and came up with two very different movies and then both were so horrible they decided to smash both of them together, hoping two negatives would make a positive! It did not work. The only redeeming quality from this movie was Hardy and the effects, Venmo really did look spectacular. The end fight was uneventful, the romance embarrassingly awkward, and the plot forced. Would the movie have been better if it was rated R, probably but not by much, I also don't understand why they only made it 1 hour and 37 minutes long... adding another 25 or 30 minutes would have made an impact but I am not sure how you would have saved this dumpster fire!

Tom Hardy and Woody Harrelson are respected actors, and Michelle Williams is a serious artist with several enduring cinematic dramas in her repertoire.

This misfit from the Marvel canon has had a decidedly ropy time outside the comics. Between a design that calls for only the most convincing CG and a requisite level of violence that would make investors queasy, it's not hard to see why a quality Venom film that pleases true fans might be a very unrealistic prospect.Tom Hardy is a fan. Thank him for making what little fans got happen, and while the film surrounding him on his first outing was completely forgettable (down to an atrocious music score and even worse end song by Eminem), his turn in the title role was anything but. The interplay between Eddie Brock and symbiote Venom makes or brakes any attempt at an adaptation, and even part 1 delivered. Part 2, while not quite a triumph for the ages, gives us more of what worked well and minimizes what didn't last time around.Hardy is no stranger to dual roles interacting with each other (see his wonderful work in Legend), and his solo scenes with Venom, be they of simple banter or domestic conflict, are the best things in the film, and set it apart in a very saturated superhero genre. Some of the more surrealist touches, like villain Cletus's animated story and Venom at a costumed rave, also take full advantage of the inherently bizarre nature of the premise. It is unfortunate then, that the rest of the film doesn't embrace the madness, or tones it down, courtesy of a studio mandated PG-13 rating (the source of much of the ire among fellow users' reviews). At times, what we get feels oddly sanitized, and thus nowhere near what fans of the character(s) hoped for or deserved.I myself am not a Venom fan (or even a Marvel/DC comics fan at all), though I love the design and premise. It's easier for me to appreciate what did work here. At a slick 96 minutes, the running time did smell of studio interference, but on the other hand, it was nice to watch a more compact superhero film. The humor worked better this time too, with a meaner, darker edge to it that suited the character and again made it feel different from Marvel and DC's output. Same goes with the inky, fluorescent photography, by ace Tarantino-go-to-DP Robert Richardson (of all people...). Add in some loopy scene-stealing turns from seasoned pros like Woody Harrelson, Naomie Harris and Stephen Graham, and there's enough fresh stuff here to endear you to it.There are far worse ways to spend your time.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

When movie got delayed during COVID I knew I was up for this movie I knew I wasn't excited and pumped for this then when trailer came out it did nothing for me nothing at all, the movie and humour was just over top stupid rather then making an R-RATED Venom vs Carnage film because Carnage is evil character, evil looking creature he is and plus a serial killer killed a lot of victim's?? Yeah that movie is for kids who would thought making Carnage PG-13?? Would be good idea?? I love to know who?? You know what everyone you might wanna show Natural Born Killers that's like me making Natural Born Killers with PG-13 that would lamest, laziness, dumbest film of all time in film history like this movie, rather having a dark, gritty, sinister, gore film it is like Disney cartoon film that could been made in 90's. Seriously inserted making Carnage evil character they made like comedy like if this movie was parody like scary movie type this like parody this movie was taken nothing series. The director Andy Serkis is actor known Lord of Rings that's play's little monster Gollum who says my Precious like if Venom was his Precious?? But he made movie like Circus it makes me wanna hate Lord of Rings even more even with this movie I hated everything about movie, it lost so much potential in movie so much it lost it in more then 100 yards, Andy Serkis is terrible director to me he doesn't know nothing to Carnage character nothing at all oh he looks evil but let's make it PG-13 so if Venom is R-RATED it would flop well let me give you a list Deadpool 1-2 was such successful, Logan, Suicide Squad 2, Joker, Netflix Marvel series like Daredevil, Punisher, Jessica Jones I know their aren't box office hit because they are TV series look at success they had. But Venom sadly you had so much things to do with R-RATED but nope let's have PG-13 Circus film, with off-screen kills witch is lame, lame jokes, none of staff I found funny expect for at end showdown let me tell you something this sequel hasn't changed for bit since past 2 years (2018) Venom film sadly to say Tom Hardy character still play's a loser, play's a dumbass type. Only thing they changed wasmore of rememberable villain was Carnage that was it people love it and like it because of Carnage is in movie wow... this movie is forgettable as well next day you will forget this movie slaright away. Story follows detective Mulligan (Stephen Graham), contacts Eddie Brock/ Venom (Tom Hardy) to speak to Cletus Kasady / Carnage (Woody Harrison), a serial killer who refuses to talk to anyone other than Brock following their interview a year prior. After visiting him Cletus goes in Lethal Injection death sentence he turns into Carnage is because before execution he bitten Eddie finger Red Blood turned into like Venom that's how he turned like one. Another character Frances Barrison / Shriek that plays by Naomie Harris I didn't recognize her until I looked cast. Her character didn't do much nothing in movie all she does is screams loud makes your eyes bleed like movie does. This movie is such a waste, waste, waste of Venom a waste in a terrible film if it's written better and if it's R-RATEDit was low level of violence it had (PG13 and all that), do not expect this to be any better don't expect R-RATED please don't if you do your gonna be very wrong about this. Making Tom Hardy single again. Apparently, things didn't work out between him and Anne (Michelle Williams) like in first film wasn't was new Chatty Cathy Venom we had to endure. Here is this sinister, brain-eating, alien symbiote that wants to be a comedian ALL THE TIME. It was flat out amazing how much Venom talked, and not in a good way. Then Venom leaves Eddie body jumps to everyone at streets he goes to party he does a speech to party does a microphone speech about Eddie doesn't want Venom no more??? Making him like cry baby... see I think nowadays Marvel is dead to me superhero films are dead too me very dead flat dead just like with this movie. Look I understand in comics has humour in Venom character I understand you can have Levity that's Fine But not over the top comedy like in 1st and in this movie there's a FULLY blown chaos comedy. There are a difference between levity and a full blown comedy childish comedy trash like you see in kids movies or cartoon films just like since Batman & Robin (1997) takes itself nothing seriously I don't get why people defend film??I expect a Venom movie to have Venom actually fight bad guys and at times be vicious. Not for it be a 'long, unfunny episode' of The Odd Couple. Especially one with Carnage in it. If you expect something different to this sequel well let me tell you something theirs NOTHING different in this sequel don't expect R-RATED gritty violence, don't expect dark perfect script, perfect writing I wish that was but it's not it's full on childish film. This movie is called Let their be Carnage let me tell you this theirs no Carnage in this movie. Their is name Carnage in film but not actual no movie like he goes around kills people show him as that creature going for rampage, film title is called Carnage but theirs no Blood that he does in film, no Venom does Mic-drop like kids film. If you wanna see Carnage without creature all that even it's played by Woodly Harrison go watch Natural Born Killers in 90's film he play's like Carnage but he doesn't turn into creature Carnage but he play's a serial killer that shows more violence more things in it him playing butcher and he butchered girl family.. that should been in this film if people aredefending those 1-2 Venom films they are completely wrong 100% Carnage should never be PG-13 film at all he is evil, lunatic, psychopath character, scary looking guy, something more like sinister type but no you have comedy type of character in movie. Unbelievable I saw this movie for free thank goodness I didn't pay for it at all I didn't pay for first one I saw it with friend 3 years ago I got to see it for free I will never spend a ticket to see movie give my money away to go see Venom in big screen reason I saw this movie is because I saw it for free at my friends place and I wanted to see Carnage in film that's it. Theirs big issue when Venom is PG I don't understand why they can't make Venom R-RATED make that R-RATED but because it's PG-13 because it wants to be related to Spider-Man films so let Spiderman be PG-13 have Venom, let have R-RATED Venom to be on it's own rating of film.. but nope it can't because that's not fair at all even title is called Carnage PG-13 dumpster crap director is god awful he needs to go back to his crave go and direct more 50 other lord of rings crap. Sorry for long review but this is how much crap this movie really is.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

In the last few years, Hollywood has taken a turn for the worse and pushes a lot of politics in films. This film largely avoids the politics and mostly feels organic.There's a lot to like about this film. The story is fun. The action scenes are exciting and the cinematography is consistently interesting. The mix of characters mostly works. You can switch off and enjoy this film for what it is.Where this film narrows its target audience is that the humour is too juvenile and that a few of the performances are particularly wooden. The worst two performances are Harris (Frances Barrison) and Harrelson (Cletus Kasady). They are especially one-dimensional.If you can look past a few mediocre performances (especially Harris, who is usually excellent as per her Pirates of the Caribbean role as Calypso) and roll with the juvenile humour, the rest of the film is plain good fun. It's great that you don't have to feel like you're being beaten over the head with shallow politics for once.I would highly recommend this film to people in their early teens that like a bit of gore and profanity. The gore itself is quite tame but the concepts can be intimidating for quieter and more sensitive teens.I would put this film in the ""highly recommended"" for certain younger audiences. Especially that it doesn't ram politics like most films do today. I would definitely recommend it.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie focuses on serial killer Cletus Cassidy and his rough upbringing. When Eddie Brock is chosen to be his reporter, and Cassidy takes a bite of him, the symbiote suit on Brock breaks off and infects Cassidy creating a ruthless killer like never seen before. Can Brock and Venom stay on the same page long enough to bring him down? This movie is directed by Andy Serkis (Heavenly Sword) and stars Tom Hardy (Bronson), Woody Harrelson (Natural Born Killer), Naomi Harris (28 Days Later), Michelle Williams (Blue Valentine) and Stephen Graham (Snatch). The storyline for this is very compelling and is well written from a plot to character standpoint. The dialogue is first rate and hilarious as are the special effects, which are fantastic. The CGI fits the comics to perfection. The action scenes from beginning to end are wondeful; my one complaint, this is the darkest and most violent and gruesome Marvel comic series, and every kill and gore sequence is hidden by random things like cut away scenes or random tornados 🌪 to hide what are gruesome kills in the comic. The dialogue makes up for it but the lack of showing the kills keeps this from being the masterpiece it had the potential to be. This is a worthwhile sequel I would score a 7.5/10.","30 out of 89 found this helpful.

As a result, the talent of the cast is wasted and any potential for something improved is dead on arrival. And all that is left is uninspired silliness just for the sake of it.I imagine when obnoxious Hollywood directors talk down comic book movies, ""Venom: Let there be carnage"" is exactly the kind of movie they have in mind, and Iron Man (2008) to a lesser extent.Much has been made of the movie's end credit scene; I think it is meaningless.

Before I go to things that I feel like it needs to be improved on, I like to say what I feel is alright. It does have a little disagreement between Eddie and Venom of which does help advance their character arc. It really shows that they're two different characters.Now with the complaints, the story seems to do more telling than showing. That can stem from them trying to do it within a PG-13 rating. With Cletus Kassidy being a serial killer, he's a character best done with the R rating. It's better as well if the movie was at least a half hour longer. That will prevent the story from breaking the role of show don't tell and would prevent the story from feeling rushed. I like to see something like a director's cut where it's pretty much this movie but it's a half hour or two longer and has the R rating. I feel like something with this set of characters could work, just the rating and the runtime just prevents it from going to its full potential.I feel this movie is ok at best and feel like there should have more added to live up to its wasted potential.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Once again starring Tom Hardy in the lead role and this time joined by Woody Harrelson, it is a notable improvement over the original despite not being a difficult task.One year after the events of the first film, Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) is still working as a journalist while also tolerating the alien symbiote Venom sharing his body. Eddie is soon required to conduct another interview with detained serial killer Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson), who is now on death row. After the interview has been completed, Venom is able to deduce precisely where Cletus has hidden his victim's bodies, which boosts Eddie's journalistic career significantly. On the day of Cletus's execution, things go terribly wrong as a red symbiote emerges from him and breaks them both free from prison. This new symbiote refers to himself as Carnage and strikes a deal where if Cletus is able to help him find Eddie/Venom, Carnage will help Cletus reunite with his estranged girlfriend.Honestly, I wasn't all that fussed on the 2018 film ""Venom"". The whole movie felt like a watered down, tonally inept, oddly paced origin story of an iconic Marvel supervillain. Considering how sinister the character is supposed to be, I was constantly wishing that the film was R-rated and had really let loose on the gory detail. With that said, I am willing to admit there were some positive traits that I enjoyed, like how they nailed Venom's physical appearance, voice, and personality. Fortunately, most of the aforementioned issues have been addressed in the sequel, as things feel much more consistent this time around, making it a successful follow-up to an otherwise disappointing original.It appears the filmmakers have listened to some of the feedback regarding the original's inconsistent tone. Instead of awkward attempts at comic relief, all of the humour here flowed naturally through the characters at the best of times, especially from Venom himself. I actually got some decent chuckles out of almost all of these scenes, as opposed to cringing at the cheesy jokes in the first film. Of course, there were some moments that were obviously aimed at younger audiences, which makes sense since this is still a PG-13 marketed movie. However, this outing seemed much better tailored to suit the tastes of both young and old viewers alike, rather than feeling all over the place.To my surprise, this film was directed by none other than Andy Serkis (yes, THAT Andy Serkis, a.k.a. Gollum). Under his helm, Serkis addresses the pacing issues in the original by keeping this one moving along at an almost breakneck speed. As a result, the film clocks in at a mere 97 minutes in length, much shorter than most other superhero movies, which are typically over two hours. Normally I would be dismissive of this type of movie being as short as it is but thanks to Serkis, virtually everything works out for the most part. Despite its short length, the film still manages to squeeze in just enough action, character drama, and genuine superhero fun to satisfy fans of the genre. In particular, the final climactic battle was handled well with the build up towards it feeling earned and not simply there for the sake of an elaborate action scene.In the first film, Tom Hardy's performance in the main role was one of its biggest strengths and that's also the case here with the sequel. Hardy is great at playing the duel role of the mild mannered Eddie and the hungry-for-action Venom. Their dynamic here is considerably more comedic, with Venom's eccentricities frequently clashing with Eddie's wish to get some peace and quiet. It's also amusing to see how characters from the previous film just accept that Eddie is now hosting an alien symbiote inside his body, simply treating it as a normal occurrence.But of course the real focus here has to be on Woody Harrelson as Cletus Kasady/Carnage. Like with Venom, the effects used on Carnage look fantastic and Harrelson's dark take on the character helps emphasise this. Interestingly, I couldn't help but draw some parallels between Cletus Kasady and Mickey Knox, Harrelson's character in ""Natural Born Killers"". Both happen to be serial killers focused on by the media who would do anything to protect their significant other. Whether the decision to cast Harrelson based on that comparison was intentional or a mere coincidence is up for debate but it certainly adds a more threatening undercurrent to his presence in the film.Though I initially had my doubts, this sequel to a painfully mediocre original has proven that a character like Venom is fully capable of holding his own in these series of films. I still would have preferred to have seen a more gritty, R-rated continuation of his story, one where we could actually see him bite someone's head off onscreen, but I'm mostly happy with the direction this one has taken. I'm curious to see where things will go from here. Will Sony Pictures let this Venom appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe or will they keep him as part of something separate altogether? I suppose we'll have to wait and see what happens over the next few years.I rate it 7/10.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

The hero Hardy (Venom) accidentally infects a dangerous maniac (Harrelson) and he turns into the same monster with whom they will swing. And in this part, the helplessness and worthlessness of Hardy's hero as a person becomes too obvious. Without Venom, he's a dummy, and physically can't stand up for himself, and he's not a correspondent, and as a mean person and as a so-so boyfriend. And the hero should cause at least some positive feelings. And then suddenly Venom becomes a positive hero...well, so-so.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's only an hour and a half long, with a hell of a fast pace, and I got the feeling in the final scene that the film was short. I'm serious about the fast pace. The whole movie is just action after action after action that doesn't really stop. On the plus side, it's good that I wasn't bored for a second because the movie kept overwhelming me with a ton of action scenes, which were of course excellent. Carnage comes on the scene and the moments with him were awesome. Of course the film is mostly about Venom, who is over the top here. On the one hand, we get a good dose of Venom, but personally I would have preferred if maybe he wasn't here so much. How can I put this. The pacing is so fast that the film lacks room for any story in the finale in my opinion. It could have done with more dialogue here and there in my opinion, and it just wouldn't have hurt to slow down in places and absorb all the adrenaline the film has to offer. On top of that, when we do get some room for plot, it's mostly comedic scenes, which will probably suit a lot of people, but personally I would have preferred a more serious approach. To sum up. The new Venom isn't a bad movie. I enjoyed it. The dose of proper CGI action was fun, but it was just too much in my opinion. So it's both a cool thing, because there's always something going on, and actually the biggest minus of the film, because you just don't stop and there's always some action, and there's also some comedic dialogue at times, which, while entertaining, in my opinion, unnecessarily brings down the seriousness of the plot. This is my opinion. Like I said the film is not bad and I certainly can't say I didn't enjoy it, but for me it is an above average film that I would rather not recommend. Perhaps only to fans of Venom.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Things seem to occur erratically, attempt to build suspense or drama in some parts and then are completely irrelevant or negated a scene or two later. Anne's return felt like fan service with her hosting Venom for a short duration. Pretty flat script, nothing creative or amazing. Felt like Toby-man 3. Suffering from cramming too much into a script that produced a 90 min film. Not better than the first, and not making the MCU movies sweat at all.

We enjoyed the first Venom movie and when we saw a sequel was coming out for it, we were underwhelmed because of the trailers. It seemed like it was going to be a disaster. But we were proved wrong, this movie actually was a fun time. The actors in this movie made things a lot more enjoyable. Tom Hardy, you always got to love this guy, he's a great actor and pulls off Venom's voice very well. Woody Harrelson looked like he was having a lot of fun playing as Cletus and his voice for Carnage was spine chilling. This movie was fun but we have to point out a lot of problems with this movie. The writing is kinda choppy and the script was cringy and at some points, out of place. They also changed up Dan's character completely! In the first movie, he was extremely kind and likable. But in this one, he's a giant dick and is just an inconvenience to the story. Even the movie takes notice to how pointless he is in this movie. The CGI was decent and Venom's CGI kind of got a downgrade from the last one. But Carnage's CGI was pretty decent. But a lot of the bad things canceled out the good things, nods to the comic books and stuff ripped straight out of them. And that end credits scene, you'll just have to watch it for yourself.This movie was extremely fun to watch and was quite the adventure. It has its flaws and can be kind of stupid at some points but if you're a big Marvel fan, you'll enjoy it either way.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, things go awry when Cletus becomes the host to a dangerous symbiote named Carnage. With Eddie having his own trouble with his own symbiote Venom (leading to Venom leaving Eddie and finding new hosts) Eddie asks ex-girlfriend Anne to find Venom so that he can put a stop to Carnage's deadly rampage...As sequels go Let There Be Carnage is pretty decent, if not quite as good as the first film. It's fairly short and quick to get going; though it's arguable that the first film needed to be longer and a tad slower in order to establish its origin story. The relationship between Venom and Eddie is explored well here; their exploits together are hilarious so much so that they almost behave like a married couple at times; this is highlighted in a brilliant one liner by Dan Lewis at one point in the film. I did like the way that Eddie does everything in his power to try to appease Venom even though it never quite seems to be enough.Once Carnage is unleashed the film begins to go through the gears providing many thrilling fights between Venom and Carnage; Venom facing a more powerful adversary exposes his vulnerability which makes the fights a tad more intense. I wasn't as impressed with Shriek as a character whom for me was not particularly interesting; her extremely loud screaming just seemed a bit silly and given that this causes an issue to the symbiotes she actually acted more of a hindrance than help; again this could have been flipped to have more impact on the symbiotes had it been used better within the context of the story.As far as the performances go then there's not much that needs to be said about Tom Hardy (whom is arguably one of the finest actors of his generation). His interplay with Venom which essentially set the pair up as a double act was both amusing and at times strained as he has to continually try to keep control of his symbiote as well as keeping him happy. Woodly Harrelson is great and puts in a very memorable performance. Naomi Harris (whom I have to admit to not recognising at first) is also superb, but I just wish that her character was more interesting. Michelle Williams does well with what she had to work with, but isn't used very well and I didn't think much of Reid Scott's performance (then again maybe it's not entirely his fault as he felt like a bit of a nothing character). Stephen Graham is also good in his respective role.Serkis fast-paced direction and general sense of fun do help to paper over some of the cracks that exist with characterisation etc and the special effects are also top notch.Whilst this falls ever so slightly short of being as good as the first film, it is a lot of fun and blitzes by at a lightning pace. There was plenty of carnage, but in this film that was a good thing.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

My opinion is that there were plenty of mistakes that don't match the comic book premise. A rushed story that makes Eddie look like a real loser and an incompetent idiot. They make Cletus Kasada all knowing and Carnage a hight tech IT connoisseur who can hack everything :D . The movie had many variations of how to do it but they took it from the wrong end. The short story with no logic was just icing on the cake. The cameo at the end partly saves it.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Hoping for more and getting a lot less. As with all Marvel films, it's worth rewatching to see what I maybe missed with my expectation glasses on.Having Woody Harrelson playing a villian set my expectations mighty high. What with his unique, lovable bad guys (as in his murderous role in Natural Born Killers), and his cheeky, humorous turns in so many other films, seeing him play Cletus wasn't as awe-inspiring as I'd hoped. He actually reminded me of his Knox performance more than on one occasion. His love interest, the screecher called Shriek, played by Naomie Harris, reprising her role of Tia Dalma from Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (not really, but very similar), is poorly underused.Luckily Let There Be Carnage has a shorter running time, as the bickering Brock and Venom can only be used so much, and the fight sequences are cut nicely short. This is no Avengers, but a good enough bad guy/good guy conundrum faced by Brock's double identity.I love Gollum, and the amazing actor who brought him to life, but maybe directing is not for Serkis after all!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But I must say I was left feeling quite disappointed with this one. In my opinion, Carnage's introduction was far too late. Plenty of time-wasting and lazy writing had filled up the majority of the film. Not much had happened until the last 20 minutes, plus the final action sequence felt rushed. Unfortunately, this was not as good as the first one. As a fan of Venom, I felt underwhelmed, but I have not lost hope yet and hopefully, it can redeem itself for its next appearance. That post-credits scene sure hooked me up.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The film feels very rushed, just trying to get to the end as quickly as possible for that post credits scene. The acting is not great, the script is not poor, a major step backwards from what the first film accomplished. Often with some films you see all the best parts within the trailers, this is the case with Venom LTBC, some bits aren't even in the film or have been changed slightly.

The premise of the film sees Eddie Brock and Venom have to figure out their relationship while going against a serial killer and his own symbiote.Main Character
Tom Hardy plays Eddie Brock and voices Venom and he does a pretty good job. I just find his performance as Brock entertaining and clearly somebody who is enjoying himself. He doesn't get much character development but I think there is just about enough here to give Hardy props for his role in the film. Venom is actually given more development and it is executed pretty well, I actually felt feeling towards the symbiote. He is also pretty funny and for me the dynamic between Venom and Eddie Brock is probably the highlight of the film.Supporting Characters
The first Venom film suffered from not creating interesting supporting characters and it is a shame that this film is the same. Woody Harrelson reprises his role of Cletus Kassidy/Carnage from the post credit scene of the first film and I just never got invested in his character. He just came across as a weirdo and a guy with no character. Harrelson is clearly enjoying himself but the character of Carnage is not given the justification that he deserves here. Naomi Harris plays Shriek and unfortunately, she is even worse. She just has these terrible one liners and her over the top bizarre performance is just too much for me and does nothing for me. The great Stephen Graham plays a police officer and it's not even that he is bad, he is actually alright but his character is dull and there is literally no reason to care and it is a shame that such a talent is wasted here. Michelle Williams is back as Anne from the first film and she is just as boring here, I just don't like the character and I have felt like Williams phones it in and signed a contract that she had to be here as she does very little here.Story
The relationship between Eddie and Venom is represented quite well here and I like how we saw more things from Venom's point of view this time around. But it is flawed, the dynamic between Carnage and Venom fails and the dynamic between Brock and Cassidy doesn't work either. The characters don't get enough time to develop and you won't care about anybody apart from Venom and maybe Eddie.Script
The script is okay, the humour was something I was worried about in the trailer but I can't deny that it worked for me. I chuckled quite a few times with Venom having some funny one liners. But the drama falls really flat and is so rushed that when it comes to the big showdown I kind of didn't care.Style
Both Venom and Carnage both look great and the clash between them is way easier to follow then the action in the first film. But the pacing is all over the place, it starts off at 100 miles an hour and then slows down and ties to focus on way too much. It needed a longer runtime to make the audience care about the characters.Overall
Overall, Venom; Let There Be Carnage is an average film that doesn't rise above its predecessor. It is okay and I don't think will bring any new fans but there is a huge post credit scene and that is all that people will be talking about coming out of this film.Rating - 5/10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

But damn, I wasn't expecting it to be such a mess.Again, I had no expectations. The first movie was just ok, not great, but watchable, not one of Marvel's finest, so I knew in my heart the 2nd won't reach that bar. But Let there be Carnage set the bar way lower than it should feel comfortable with.First off, the story was all over the place and by that I mean they made no effort to give us something exciting. Basic plot, extremely poor pacing, lackluster climax. They even introduced characters ( one in particular ) JUST SO THEY COULD SET UP ANOTHER ONE. I'm not even kidding, apart from a flimsy excuse for a love interest, it's only achievement was to set up another character for Venom 3. And to be honest, I rewatched the scene and I can't seem to grasp how this future character gets powers. I know who it's supposed to be, but he seems to get powers by magic, honestly. And let's not even get into how Carnage comes into existence, that's somehow even worse. Simply bad writting.Second, the CGI. Not sure what happened, but it's worse than the 1st movie. It's so overused that it just takes you out of the story completely and it sure doesn't help when it's used to give the antagonist unexplained powers in the climax.3rd, the casting. I'm sorry to say, but Harelson wasn't a good choice, I felt nothing from him, lifeless interpretation. Don't get me wrong, I like him as an actor, but he gave 0% for this role. And no, it's not just because he got 10 mins of screentime, the direction he took or was told to was boring at best. The other characters we already know from the 1st movie and they're more or less the same, so nothing to say about that, same people, same performance, average.I don't want to spoil the movie, that's why I refrained from making this a spoiler filled review, but I doubt anyone would care after they actually see it because there's not much to spoil, nothing interesting or exciting, nothing special or out of the ordinary, nothing stellar to talk about. It's a B movie at most. The only interesting thing is the end scene that hints at a much better movie we'll get in the near future.In conclusion, do not expect anything from Venom: Let there be Carnage. Watch it, eat some popcorn, enjoy the end credit scene, forget about the movie by morning.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Don't pay attention to the haters. I WANNA SEE IT AGAIN.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

It is a fun movie and it has some well directed action sequences. Hardy is great as Brock and Venom is hilarious. Fast forward to Venom, Let there be Carnage, and I can't find anything noteworthy to be positive about. Woody doesn't seem like the same character they set up from the first film at all and frankly, neither does Eddie. With Cletus, he is shown right off the bat to be super sympathetic, hurting, longing which is a far cry from the whacko sprawling messages on the wall in blood. (and don't even get me started on the hair!) The addition of Shriek was pointless as she had no chemistry with Cletus and the storyline overall was pretty uninteresting. The scenes with Brock/Venom were ok but not nearly as fun this time around, mostly due to the lines they gave Venom. His delivery wasn't as good, most of the jokes don't land, and the voice wasn't as deep or menacing as it was in the first either. It felt like they went overboard when they could have just kept the same balance they had before. Also, Venom kept exposing himself with his ""tentacles"" all the time, just randomly when Eddie is around other people. Are you telling me no one ever noticed?? Yeah, right.And while I appreciate movies that don't turn their properties into 3 - 4 hour ""epics"", The runtime is this is just way too short and leaves no room for character development, especially with the supporting players. I think a good 10-15 minutes more might have improved some things but overall, you can't really make up for the bland story, inconsistent acting, and so-so direction.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I am a huge fan of the Spider-Man universe. This is my favorite comic book character. And I am a huge skeptic of the new film universe of this hero. And if it's about the Spider itself and its not the best pictures (it's about Holland) I can talk for a long time, and it's worth leaving it until solo, we'll only touch on Venom here.One of the most iconic villains of Spider-Man. And now for the second film, not the best things are being done with him. I was cool with the first picture, but accepted it as a given. And here comes the sequel. Which turns out to be even worse. So the authors decided to move away from the gloom and cruelty of the character, changed his background, made the plot comical. And it would be fine if it worked correctly. In the first film there were some attempts through the duo of Brock and Venom. But now even this does not catch on.The picture has become shorter in timing. This helped the plot not to sink. But now they don't reveal anything to us at all. The picture is empty and just jumps through the events. We don't see any development. In fact, the film is some kind of filler. The characters are standing still. The conflicts have not changed since the first part. And the second time to look at the same thing, albeit in a slightly different wrapper, is not interesting. The problems of the heroes are sucked out of the finger.Two new characters do not give the film novelty. Yes, Woody Harrelson is charismatic, but this is not enough, and there is not much of him in the film. Squeal is a completely empty villain. Well, Carnage. You really expect something powerful from such a character. And you get a zilch.Humor is not bad in places, but only in places. The battles of the symbiotes have become more watchable. The relationship between Brock and Venom is still interesting to watch. But there's nothing else catchy about the movie. When the scene after the credits looks more interesting than the movie, it means something is wrong. And looking at her, I feel that it won't get any better.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Is it out of some obligation? Does he feel that it would be wrong to upset the fans who don't like changes within the Marvel Universe or does he just need money to add an extra wing to his mansion? He doesn't strike me as the type to really be bothered by either of these things, so maybe he was promised that it wouldn't be so bad this time and it was too late to back out when he realised that this film is actually even worse than the first 'Venom' (2018) film.It's like they're trying to compete with the terrible early 'Batman' films. I mean this could almost rival 'Batman Forever' (1995) as the worst superhero film. And it has so many similarities in the way that it's made.The villains are ridiculously comic book to the extreme and very poorly acted/directed/portrayed in general.Not only that, but the symbiotic relationship between Eddie Brock (Hardy) and Venom (Also Hardy) is stupidly comical, but not in the funny 'Deadpool' (2016) way that it's trying to be.It actually gets very farcical and reminded me of watching arguments between Dorothy and her ex husband Stan in 'The Golden Girls' (1985-92), except that they did it better. At the very least it's like a silly cartoon.Some of the comedy isn't bad, but most of it is cringeworthy and what's annoying is that it could be funny if it wasn't so stupid, which is to say that if they actually focussed on the comedy instead of trying to make it an additional element, it could have worked.The way that it's filmed is odd and doesn't work, because it hasn't been thought through properly. There are mixed styles that don't blend together. It doesn't know what type of film it wants to be. Is it sinister, is it Tim Burton, does it want to be more ""Art House"" cinema? It's actually a bit of a mi^dfu<k in that way and is the whole thing actually a metaphor for schizophrenia anyway?I have to wonder if Stan Lee would have let this be released with his name attached to it, had he still been with us?Tom is fine as Eddie, but the whole story and production lets him down.Stephen Graham, as Mulligan however didn't seem to work for me. If the Marvel Encyclopaedia is to be believed, he might turn up again as another symbiote called Toxin, but is he the appropriate for the larger role? I can appreciate Stephen taking on America and good luck to him, but I personally don't think that he is quite the right fit.As for Woody Harrelson as Carnage, you could make a sandwich out of his Ham, Cheese and Corny performance. He is awful and far too over the top.And is Naomie Harris still playing the witch from 'Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men's Chest/At Worlds End' (2006/7)? Is this the same character years later after drinking an immortality potion or something. I didn't even need to look her up to see where I knew her from, because she was exactly the same in every way. Another attempt to rival DC (Comics) perhaps with a Harley Quinn type character.Just bad, bad, bad!Thank god and all that's holy that it was short.Please Sony, do the right thing, I'm begging you, give the rights to Disney!?253.66/1000.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Here the story and dialogue is all over the place without being fleshing out so your not connected, the plot seems sped/cranked up to get the movie back on track from scenes that goes on a little to long with bad dialogue and no real importance for the movie. And it's carnage and PG13, why?! This movie didn't need much to be a much better film, could even have kept most of the scenes, just write better dialogue, jokes and flesh out the plot a little (they have good actors, just bad lines). And venoms voice, less is more, it's just yelling with effects (right amount first film, this one just makes you aware that you find it ennoying). This movie gave me no other impression then a money grab, they know people like venom and carnage, put a PG13 for bigger audience/demographic so as long CGI venom and carnage are in the movie we don't need any effort in the writing (may be the pandemic faults with the curse of many bad movies being rushed out). As people have already said, they could have just kept the end scene from this one and replace the end scene from the first one, give themselves more time to write a fleshed out story and good dialogue.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It plays with the what made the original film successful. Letting the protagonist take over AND consume us with their natural charm.Hardy and Michelle Williams made the film. As already said, the screenplay is awful. The convenient-for-its-own-good storytelling, Venom lazily becoming the narrator of the film, and the awkward scripting (ie the jokes).I felt that the film biggest problem of the film is that it does not know how to handle the ideas they had. Unlike the more successful Marvel films, it has no grand feeling of an epic. The stakes is pretty much spelled out as the villains is one dimensional played straight and boringly to hell.In addition, the presence of Venom is too much. He is already the internal narrator/voice of reason in the film AND that felt extremely annoying at times. He just cannot do no wrong. Also, the jokes would falls flat for much less comedic actors (i.e. The new MCU actors). Kudos to Hardy in knowing how to camp it up. He, Michelle Williams and Reid Scott (famous for his role in Veep) plays up the aspect of the film really well.Overall, the film is fun BUT empty. Forgettable [5/10].","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is just Tom Hardy talking to himself for at least 70% of this movie, and a lot of unfunny banter from him and Venom. The other 30% is Carnage and his Girlfriend walking around blowing things up and just doing typical evil villain stuff. And in the end for no reason at all they end up at a church getting married and Venom and Carnage fight. Also the creation of Carnage was so quick and sudden, and it felt like the writers did not know how to put Carnage in this film. He basically bites Tom Hardy, then next thing you know he turns into Carnage and his first line is literally ""I am Carnage."" He comes up with his own name on the spot. He then is inside a prison but can create a tornado to escape. Yeah.....I know.They only fight once in this entire film, there is no build up or a fight in the middle to set up the final match. The final match is kinda cool and it is pretty long. Venom does say some funny stuff in this battle, but by then you are already bored to death. Seriously this movie is so surreal to watch. You gets scenes of Venom walking around going into a club making peace speeches. You get Chinese ladies getting controlled by Venom. Venom and Tom Hardy just argues to each other most of this film, I am being serious. It isn't funny and it gets really old quick. They just repeat the same stuff over and over.There is really no real plot to be honest, and the post credit scene makes no sense now that Spiderman: No Way Home has come out. I say skip this movie, it is probably one of the more worst Comic book movies to come out in a while. It isn't in the top, but it is still pretty bad. This isn't Fantastic 4 (2005) bad, but this is pretty much on the same level as Ghost Rider 1 or Iron Man 2.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

As a fan of the first film, I was excited for the next iteration. Let me start by saying, I think there are a few types of people who watch this: Fans of the comics, fans of the general film franchise, and people just wanting a blockbuster action flick or something to throw on, grab a snack, veg out and turn the brain off. This appeals to only one of those, I feel.I liked the movie fine. I also kinda hated it. As far as movies go, yeah, it's three stars. Tom Hardy and a speck of unique acting prowess can't save this movie from the abysmal effects, tired comedy, and simply astoundingly bad writing. I'd argue Woody Harrelson was an odd casting choice for Carnage, and the other acting performances were pretty hit or miss as well. I'm no acting critic, but boy, this script and directing must have been unbearably painful to film.I guess if you want a slapstick superhero, stick to Deadpool? Maybe if the writing had been better, and the effects even 10% believable, this would score higher - as it is, I could not stop focusing on how... just... bad the film looked. The more I thought about it, the worse the movie got. I've seen better independent student project effects than what were on display here.So, if you hate thinking, you'll love this movie!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I like that Carnage is a product of Venom, so watching these monsters clashing with each other is phenomenal.Venom: Let There Be Carnage is about a journalist named Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) who has a dark black, Spiderman looking devil named Venom that lives inside his body. Most of the movie shows Eddie and Venom not getting along, because Eddie is sick and tired of having Venom inside his body and Venom wants to be free to eat people. Venom is very clumsy and destructive and Eddie is frustrated because his apartment is a mess. An assassin named Cletus Kasady (Woody Harrelson) knows Eddie and asks to speak to him before his death sentence is carried out. Eddie visits Cletus in prison, but Cletus antagonizes Eddie with his past and Venom comes out of Eddie's body to choke Cletus. Cletus bites Eddie's hand and tastes Venom's blood. So guess what happens? You have to watch the film to find out.This film has amazing CGI graphics. The graphics look so real and the buildings falling apart when Venom climbs between them look real as well. The fighting scenes between these two titans are so incredible that it makes you want to see more. I expected there to be more encounters between Venom and Carnage and was disappointed that there weren't more. The movie has a good combination of comedy and action. The music is appealing in every scene. My favorite part is, of course, the battle between Venom and Carnage in the church. Carnage is huge compared to Venom and looks more powerful than him because Carnage has multiple extremities which Venom does not have.The moral of this film is to never underestimate yourself no matter your size or strength. You do not know if you can win the war if you don't go to battle.I give Venom: Let There Be Carnage 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. This movie is available in theatres Friday, October 1, 2021. Tremember, like all Marvel movies, you have to wait until after the credits for a huge bonus. You have to stay seated for this one!

Those who didn't watch the first movie won't miss anything, that's for sure. Yes, someone can say that such films are primarily followed by action and graphics. Again, as I said, this film will surprise you. The graphics are more or less there, but here's the action, it feels like the filmmakers deliberately reduced it, adding just a little out of pity for the viewer. I really hoped that there would be something to see, but no, unfortunately, this is not. The film is terrible even for its genre. The maximum that this film will help you think about is the return of money for watching it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's neither bad nor good. It doesn't leave me wishing for a sequel but I'd watch it if one were made. Both Woody and Tom play their roles respectively but there's little depth, which may be the reason I find the film to be so average. The script left little room for character development for these actors to shine. Venom might play better as a darker psychological thriller rather than the typical smash em up Marvel action movie. If contemplating whether to watch, don't watch this movie because you like Hardy or Harrelson, watch it because you like the genre.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The characters are so bland and devoid of charm or charisma. There is constant humor that isn't remotely funny or witty. Venom has these supposedly witty remarks throughout the movie that are more obnoxious than amusing. I don't know if that's how it is in the comics, but here at least they're more unwelcome than anything else. The actors have no chemistry at all Woody Harrelson as a Spider-Man villain is laughable at best and Tom Hardy is boring as fe.ck. He has like no personality compared to even Topher Grace who actually is a step up in Spider-Man 3, believe it or not. The story is completely unengaging and the viewer doesn't give a crap about the character's relationships. The action is terrible and the CGI is unbearably bad. It's so blatant that it's like you're being slapped in the face with the laziness of the makers of the movie. Might have been less awful if they'd at least gone with some practical effects, but it still wouldn't save this catastrophe. Tom Hardy co-wrote the story apparently, and he definitely should stay away from writing in the future. In the end, you're left with wishing that Spider-Man would show up and put all these retarded freaks out of their misery.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

There's a mix of comedy and action which is up to preference if you like or not, but who doesn't like Venom?

Even though that wasn't a great movie, the end product was not so bad, it was pretty entertaining. Here, we can see that the movie is again cut down. The choppy editing and the restlessness of the movie clearly makes a point in saying to the viewers that they are only seeing half of a movie. It felt like at least an hour of the movie is cut out. Scenes jumped from one to the next without any kind of mise-en-scene to it. A lot of the dialogues felt like there was more context behind it that we are missing. Even with such a botched version, there were so many fun elements to this movie. The bromance, the callbacks to older movies through casting and the CGI action scenes were all factors that I really enjoyed. If not for such poor editing, I would have considered this a way better movie. I still feel like there was a way better movie on the cutting floor. I wasn't too excited by the mid-credit scene since that's really the weakest onscreen appearance of that character which doesn't deserve this wildly fun version of Venom.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

While there was a burst of interest in the sequel at the box office for 'Venom: Let There Be Carnage,' it's clear that there was a lot of overhyping at play.There are so many things wrong with 'Carnage' that it's hard to know where to begin. For one, the plot is very much ""so what?"" - to the point where it's basically just a tit-for-tat between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and Woody Harrelson's Cletus Kasady, with two dueling symbiotes giving supporting performances. The dialogue is whack, with a number of intentionally funny one-liners falling flat, a lot due to the forced delivery from the cast (Michelle Williams being perhaps the biggest offender).Sure, some will argue that 'Venom' is basically the anti-hero MCU franchise, but even so, it's too goofy and all over the place to earn a respectable spot on the Marvel mantle. It would be a mistake for the film to be welcomed further into the universe, but assume this is nothing short of inevitable.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Carnage looks awesome and that was worth the price of admission if you're a fan.The bad...half of the movie focuses on the nonsense of the antagonistic relationship between Brock and Venom. It's like a soap opera we never asked for. These squabbles and storyline were completely unnecessary. This also diminishes the terror and intimidation factor of Venom. Never in the comic did Venom make Brock eggs and bacon in the morning while telling bad jokes. Eating chickens instead of people? Oh C'mon. Maybe they had no plot and this was the best they could do. Regardless, I'm disappointed in how they portrayed Venom in this movie.For Marvel fans, check it out for the special effects and mid-credits scene.

The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, thus there are plenty of comedic scenes throughout the story that might make you laugh. The CGI is great, and I like the way Carnage looks.Now moving on to the negative parts, the story isn't very bright. The Venom-Carnage concept had so much potential I was expecting more out of it. Also, I think Woody Harrelson as Cletus Kasady didn't fit the role. His performance was not compelling enough.All in all, Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021) is a pretty average movie, totally skippable. You are not gonna hate it, but you're not gonna love it either. It lacks the charm and freshness Venom (2018) offered, making it a weaker sequel compared to the original.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is very reminiscent of movies I loved in my childhood but with slightly less logic. The acting is terrible? If it's made for kids it wouldn't be so I guess not. The action is uninspired and illegible most of the time but kids have a great imagination. If your child loves action and superheroes and that stuff, this movie is a no-brainer for them to watch. If you're an adult, hopefully you've had a long enough day working to not question anything that happens and enjoy ride the movie tells you you're going on. Verbal exposition dumps happen constantly to maintain it's accelerated pace but I don't think the audience will care that much anyway. If you're looking for character, forget it. If you're looking for an interesting plot, close your eyes. This film is for when your bowl is full of popcorn and your couch full of friends all doing something else at the same time.It has a paper thin plot with paper thin motivations. The pacing has no breaks. Everything is just blasting ahead, unable to wait to get the movie to the next scene. It's almost like the movie doesn't want itself to exist. I can't give it less than a 3 because it's not long enough to really feel like it took your time and I can really see myself enjoying this as a kid.I would recommend for children.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

That cannot be expressed in a film targeting pre-teens.There doesn't need to be gore or intense graphic scenes for the character to be portrayed well, although it could help, but he has to be somewhat scary. Whilst it's good to flesh out characters on both sides of a battle, the addition of a love interest was needless and dull and in all made the fearsome villain come across as a bit pathetic. Carnage is supposed to be a bloodthirsty psychopath, not misunderstood or a victim of mistreatment.Harrelson is an excellent actor who brought even more attention to an already well-publicised film, but this role felt like an utter waste on him. Artistic license is fine but he does not look in the least-bit similar to his comic book counterpart, and that visual intimidation would bring a lot to the film. Adding red hair does not cut it.The CGI and special effects are all good, Venom remaining the same as the first film (and looking a whole lot better than his first film adaptation), but similar to the first film, the villain lacks the 'wow' factor visually. They're essentially the same physically, but on screen Carnage lacks the powerful statement of imagery that the comics create. Again, this could be due to a rating appropriate for a younger audience.By far the best element of the film is the dynamic between Eddie and Venom. It's daft, incredibly well performed by Hardy, and genuinely funny throughout the film. That's great, and humour is needed in any superhero film, but if it's the best thing in a film containing these characters, it's not a great outcome.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

He was more charming and fun, likeable in the first, with this one he just looks dishevelled and unhappy, morose, throughout. I don't see the character, I see a tired and ageing actor.There's way too much CG as well, the first movie was better balanced in this regard. The banter between Venom and Hardy's character was a highlight of the first movie, but in this second one it feels a bit forced, and the movie fails to make Venom a bit more human and likeable I felt - something about the way he appears and is represented, a bit lifeless. They should have taken a page from Pixar's book, and brought a little more humour to the visual representation of the Venom character. Something creative and bright was missing, hard to say exactly, but the movie just lacked for original ideas I felt.So that was the overall impression - it was not very creative, there were no great little bits of character on screen, or chemistry, or just charm.

Honestly venom will be a very fun and entertaining movie for those who simply don't understand the character and just wanna see a movie . But for the true fans venom is just extremely disappointing from its poor writing it's forced comedy and from being held back due to its PG13 rating .Now I wasn't very fond on the first film either and I think it's fair to say this one is a bit better but they haven't changed much in this film . The runtime is just awful you can just tell by watching the movie that had way more to the scenes and it would just cut away to another one it's just lazy and it's the reason of poor character development. Carnage is pretty cool but again poor character arc due to bad writing . And for those who are a fan of carnage well you don't see much carnage most of his killings are off screen IT REALLY (makes no sense) cause in the first film you actually see venom biting peoples heads off but I guess it would be too extreme if either of them did it in this one I just didn't understand it overall if you wanna see a movie I guess you can watch it . But if you truly care about the character's venom and carnage I suggest you skip the movie and watch the post credit scene it's not worth your time honestly .","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

So disappointing.I never really rated the CG in the first film, I think the Venom character looked cool but didn't quite fit too well with live action. When you add in Carnage as well it was all a bit too CG heavy.The plot was meh. I can see what they were trying to do and it wasn't bad, but was instantly forgettable. Woody Harrelson (who is a terrific actor) was quite bad in this and his villain was a bit tired and bland.In terms of action it was a bit thin on the ground and the final big fight scene was fine I guess. Again not bad but instantly forgettable.What more can I say really. The character of Venom is so cool and there is so much potential, but they are just not getting these films right at all.4/10 as it was just about entertaining enough, and if nothing else it was blissfully short.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Venom should really be a darker movie and this is one of the criticisms I have.The story just feels rushed along with the jokes. Whatever way the movie was edited, it felt like they were trying to compress it into a very short time span and the result feels like a poorly edited B-movie. The whole movie just lacks any real passion or feeling, and feels like it was made for the sake of making another Venom movie.It also really bothered me that you could hardly differentiate between Venom's and Carnage's voice in the movie.I'd have no interest in watching it again, and I wouldn't recommend anyone wasting their time on it, especially if you are a diehard Marvel fan.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Carnage is another symbiote, a sort-of repeat from the first film, only this time with a genetic connection to the titular slime monster and a convicted serial killer (Woody Harrelson) in the copilot's chair. Filled with rage, his human component feels betrayed by Brock and frustrated by the system, while the crimson-hued alien aspect behind all the big VFX shots hates Venom for... uh, reasons. Together, they bust an ex-girlfriend out of super prison and blow stuff up while Brock and Venom work through some relationship drama and walk separate paths for an ill-timed stretch.All the best bits are where the main characters, co-habitating a single body, bicker amongst themselves and cause a wacky public scene. The film knows this is what we're after, dives straight in with a hilarious opening sequence inside a bathroom stall, and then runs with that idea for most of the first act. At that point, plot intrudes and we're stuck waiting through a dull splitsville storyline that never really works because the previous film already told us they literally can't survive without each other. Harrelson's scenes as bad guy of the month also under-deliver. Given his success in similarly unhinged roles (Zombieland and Natural Born Killers, for example), I'd hoped he could bring some fire to the part, but there aren't many scenes where he isn't masked by some manner of syrup or hamstrung by dumb, cryptic ramblings. Even on the rare occasions he's allowed to breathe, to add a little exposition, it's all so flat and trite... troubled youth, teased at the mental hospital, torn away from his soul mate... we've seen this story a dozen times already.I'm digressing here. This isn't an irredeemable picture. The effects are strong, especially for the new villain. The inner dialogue between cerebral host and visitor is just as fresh and appealing as it was the first time, although that's also limited by bland story decisions. There's a lot of nondescript goop-on-goop action, though, and the cast hasn't been distinguished enough to carry its own weight. Both major problems from Venom 1 which still persist in Venom 2. The good bits are exciting and unique, but the bad bits are redundant and boring. Another missed opportunity.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

How this got greenlit will be a puzzle for the ages.First of all, is this a Venom movie or some random fanfic about Woody Harrelson? Tom Hardy's screentime is underwhelming. The side characters are fake as press on nails.Second, the plot. There was none.Third, the whole movie seemed like an amateur's take on remaking the original Venom with an autistic lens. Plain weird. Doesn't work. Jokes fell flat, almost like they were told for people who innately don't get humour... Pure undistilled autism. No flame.I don't know what this movie was trying to be if I'm being perfectly honest. It's as confused as the gollum who made it. 2/10 wouldn't watch again.

The source material is being sqeezed to being a empty shell on film.. also possibly Tom hardys worst acting in this one.. compared to his acting in something like the series 'taboo' for example... he clearly is doing these films for fat pay checks. Good on him. Gives him room for passion projects.If deadpool can be R... why not venom? It needs a R rating even more. But instead makes Eddie this pleading sad sack that wants no violence... lethal protector.. what a joke. I cant even recall a single death that had any blood.. in a venom film......

Everyone acknowledges the first film was below average and quite disappointing. Yet, this asinine sequel was far worse. It is very much like the first one in that it wasted a very good cast. It wasted a great concept and certainly wasted prime source material. The character deserves better and this cast and crew certainly deserved more than what we saw at the screen. I can't tell you how nonsensical the plot is when given any rational thought. The CGI actually has gone downhill so much so that it was jarring. When the effects of Spider-Man 3 are better than this all those years later you know they were cutting corners. This is honestly one of the 10 worst comic book movies of this century.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

There's so much more they could do with Venom and Carnage and the whole romantic comedy aspect falls flat every time. This should have been a horror movie and rated R. PG-13 Carnage is stupid. This is a villain that cuts people in half a lot in the comics and he was resigned to a whiny punk with no explained motivation and little screen time.Woody was a terrible choice for Kasady. He never sells it. The CGI wasn't as good as the first movie. Every single aspect of the ex-girlfriend stuff is stupid. The whole dopey buddy investigator thing is stupid. All of the loser stuff is stupid. The way they used Shriek is stupid.The movie feels short. It's more like an episode of a TV show with a higher FX budget. It's very forgettable. There are no wow scenes. It's got a couple of laughs and some weak fight scenes.Wait for it to come out on Disney+ for free. It's not worth going to the theater.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Music choices in the film didn't feel right either for some reason. The film felt very rushed, in terms of portraying the story and quite frankly the strings pulling the story together were in tethers. Would not go to see this film again, would not buy it to own at home. Very disappointed and wouldn't be interested in going to see it again.

There's no one to carry this movie that anyone cares about. Woody is the woke icing on the cake. Can Hollywood investors not understand that when you cast violently woke actors like Woody and Clooney you have a 78% higher chance of losing your money than otherwise? Maybe they just need a write-off. Personally I like making money, not losing it. And that's why I focus on things people want to see and nothing they don't. And I stay the f away from politics. You take a stand? You just alienated 50% of your potential customers. What idiot would do that? Someone with Soros or Bezos money to burn and that's it. So don't waste your time on this one.

Action moments remain to be watched, but there is not enough action in them. For some reason, the venom brutality was avoided to appeal to the wider audience.Everything about the story is rushed, repetitive, and uninspired. There are no intimate moments to allow things sink in because the script lacks substance worth meditating on. The humor is okay at times, Tom Hardy is talented enough to have chemistry with himself, and effort went into the CGI (though it was overused). However, besides that, this production is pointless. Even the violence is unsatisfyingly suppressed for that PG-13 rating. Undoubtedly, some fanboys will be content with a mediocre fight between two characters they recognize, but as a film, Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a noisy pile of nothing.Writing: 2/10 Direction: 2/10 Cinematography: 2/10 Acting: 7/10 Editing: 4/10 Sound: 7/10 Score/Soundtrack: 5/10 Production Design: 3/10 Casting: 7/10 Effects: 6/10Overall Score: 5/10.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Many times I have wondered what made me watch this, it was a ten hour flight so I was running out of movies worth watching so it may well have been a 'last resort' that inspired me.In my defense I did watch the whole movie, albeit an edited for Delta version, mainly because I was always hoping for that; ""this is going to get better"" moment which, alas not only; never arrived but ultimately led to the worst case of; ""it can get worse""..The acting wasn't all bad, it wasn't great by any stretch of the imagination, and the CGI was pretty good, but like the most recent Spiderman movie the CGI and mediocre acting cannot make up for what is fundamentally a boring, more often predictable and pointless movie. On a long flight you know a movie isn't doing it for you when you find yourself craning to see what other passengers are watching, I did that a lot, but I did stick with it because everyone else was watching stuff I'd already seen or playing the pointless games you find on aircraft entertainment systems.Synopsis: relieved I watched it on a flight and didn't pay for movie tickets as well as hoping to forget that I ever watched it, sums it up!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Over the whole movie like Eddie and Venom.And the one joke about ,,eddie and venom"" leads the whole movie. It isn't funny anymore !!!!Besides the movie ist very short but it fels like 3 hours. But as a good point : the casting and acting are perfect ! But it doesn't carry a whole movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie simply built upon all that was good in the original Venom movie. The excellent interactions between Tom Brady's Venom were very funny. The jokes were mostly humorous and none fell flat as far as I could judge from the cinema audience who were constantly laughing. The cgi carnage (the villain in the movie played by an excellent Woody Harrelson) and Venom were top notch and didn't look cheap at all. Seamlessly emerging and submerging into human bodies. The plot although not the most
elaborate or intriguing sees Venom face of against a stronger bigger version of himself..... Eerything else in the movie is a set up to this, and that's fine, lots of the set up is a good ride. As the movie didn't have any plot holes and was fun to watch, it's comedy for me being was its biggest draw then the action. With most super hero movies these days, they tend to take themselves so seriously and are bit too melodramatic at times. There was a breakfast scene in this movie that just made me smile. Also this movie isn't tied down to the complexities of an extended universe which helps towards keeping it simple and fun. Definitely a 9/10 as superhero movies I've seen over the last view years. It's the perfect combination of not taking itself seriously while telling the story it needs to tell. Go watch it!","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

WHY would you have such a big budget film to an unknown director? It's just crazy, and it resulted in the movie being pretty bad. I mean, the first Venom (2018) movie wasn't amazing, but Ruben Fleischer (the director) at least did a better job than Serkis, because he already had 3 other films under his belt.There's so many things wrong with this movie, and I counted at least 2 big plot holes, which comes down to sloppy and lack-luster writing. And if you pair that lack-luster writing with a brand-new director, then of course things aren't going to go well. I'd honestly rather watch Venom (2018) three times over, before I watch this movie again.... that's how bad this one was.

It's all really harmless and childish and forgettable.The CGI was mostly fine, the score as well. The acting was alright, the direction not so much. The gags fell flat most of the time, but some dialogues between Venom and Eddie were actually a bit charming.Oh, and one more thing: When you take a call on a smartphone and put that thing near your face, the screen TURNS OFF.

Both characters Eddie and Venom were clearer and had personal missions. This one lacked all of that, and became a series of Hollywood scenes you string together in order to make a superhero, albeit reluctant, movie.The writing in short, was not that good and droned on, even though the actors were on spot. The plot was predictable and childish, and a bit hum drum. I sincerely hope they hire better writers for the next one, or leave the writers alone and let them be more creative. Special effects won't make up for a bad script.Andy Serkis as director was an interesting choice, but as the king of other-creatures as an actor, his directing like the script, was serviceable and predictable. No surprise there.They missed all the elements that could have made it excellent, like the conflict that would occur if Eddie had to find, or was interested in a new love. Instead they chose to beat a truly dead horse and made lackluster downright MEH!Better luck next time, or there won't be a fourth.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A well done sequel but with a lot to be desired","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7404919/?ref_=tt_urv","ethanrombal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur139134483/?ref_=tt_urv","3 October 2021","Overall the movie was spectacular with a very strong action and comedy presence that highlighted Eddie's and Venoms relationship that was a main staple of the movie as it carried throughout the film. It did a very good job of leaving off where the last one ended and expanding their story while also allowing supporting characters to grow as well. The length of the movie clocked in around 90 minute's which is quite short for movies today however it felt much longer and I mean that in a good way, all the screen time was well used and every second helped project the movie forward without expanding un-useful plot points like it predecessor. In the end I would give the movie a 7.5 out of 10. I would of given it more however it lacked a certain elements that propel movies like these, as the main foes did not set a good standing for their fight but overall badass movie, if I were to include the end credit the movie is a solid 100000000000000000000/10. No spoiler's though.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

For the love of deep fried cheese, it is a film about an ALIEN symbiote that has been around for millennia living within a human host on planet earth. If you do not in fact see where i am going with this, well, maybe either stop reading or quickly cultivate a sense of fantastical wonder. It, for me, was a rollicking good entertaining way to spend an hour and forty minutes that i would happily go back and watch again. For the record, i am not a massive fan of comic book movie adaptations, but i did enjoy this joint. I found the effects to be spot on, i also thought the dialogue, especially between Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) and the alien symbiote Venom was often times hilarious, i sometimes talk to myself in a similar way except i do not harbour an alien symbiote (Joking!!!) The action sequences were spectacular and i thought the story moved and advanced briskly enough almost to the point where it could be possible that someone unfamiliar with the character and/or someone that had not seen the first film would soon get up to speed with the narrative.For me, it is this simple, suspend your disbelief then sit back and enjoy the ride.Oh and do not attempt to apply and form of science or non-Hollywood logic to proceedings, otherwise it all falls apart. Ten out of ten for me.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

This felt like an absolute disaster to me. I don't know how Sony greenlit this, it just melts my mind. Awful writing, dreadful 'comic relief', nonsensical editing and pacing, a bunch of story quickly shoehorned in (yes sometimes you have to do that to fit these things in a <2h runtime but you don't have to make it so obvious), and overall a cringy experience.When I say 'dangerously bad'... I mean that this movie is already doing great in the box office. And any new sequels will continue to do great even if they're absolutely cringy and soulless experiences.

At no point does Cletus feel threatening, as Woody Harrerlson parades around with wide eyes and ridiculous wigs, expounding nonsensical poetry that belies clues to his meaningless actions.The pacing of the film makes little sense as the movie hurtles to its messy conclusion at a break-neck speed that allows little room for any sort of character development. Michelle Williams must be getting a huge check for this as she has absolutely nothing to do. The movie is devoid of plot and character development.Having said all of that, Tom Hardy shines as usual and as forgettable as the film is, it does have its moments.

Don't get me wrong the fight scenes were cool, Tom Hardy's acting was on point (like usual) and carnage looked really great. It tried so hard to be a comedy when that's not what it is, it's supposed to be an action thriller, and also venom is supposed to feel scary, not funny and that's the mistake they made, it was way too short and didn't feel like a movie with real effort put into it. It's worth a watch, but nothing more than that. Overall 4/10 disappointing but watchable.

Tom Hardy was poorly cast and is simply not a believable character as a journalist/writer. Woody Harrelson yet again plays a villain guy, and seems old and tired in his role.

It's like you get ""pulled"" from reality, and become one with the movie. Although Tom Hardy and fellow cast gave a fantastic performance, the story itself had very little depth. I do feel that certain cast within the movie gave off a very tiresome and/or chore-like vibe of not being entirely in character; weren't invested in their roles. Overall, I think future collaborations with (Other franchise) writers and directors could sincerely benefit the character as a whole, and perhaps bring back that ""Spark"" that seems to have been lost with the writing of this particular film. An awesome character, and a great lead actor can never compensate for an uninteresting story. 5/5 pretty-ok I guess.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This is an overloud, confused mess of a film. It wants to rub shoulders with the Deadpool sub - genre of superhero (Venom - superhero???) features, but it's seriously not in the race. (For the life of me, I still don't understand how the character can be seen as a superhero, when even in its downtime, it just appears to continue to destroy and damage stuff. Oh, wait on! That has to be funny, right?)Deadpool is funny. Ryan Reynolds is a good comic actor. There is copious witty dialogue from all characters and plenty of tongue in cheek, cleverly - staged scenes and situations, enhanced by appropriate musical selections. Venom on the other hand, just continually flounders along. It's idea of humour is to make a lot of noise, introduce massive amounts of CGI among lightning edits, smash up props and locations in a 3 Stooges type fashion and hope that its intended audience will find it hilarious. Here's the sad news folks. This punter found it just plain boring and really annoying on the ears. (In the first half of the film especially I began to dread the interplayed scenes between Venom and his host Eddie, because of them both continually screaming at one another. This was apparently done to emphasise the conflict between both characters, but there was little subtlety and like just about everything in VLTBC, was overplayed massively.)Supporting actors like Michelle Williams and Naomi Harris pop in and out, but they have little to do and are so lightly sketched, they almost appear invisible. And the action scenes? Ho - hum! If you're into cartoons, you may be drawn to them. For me, tedious is the only adjective that may suffice. I just can't get my head around the fact that studios and production companies continue to pour big money into this sort of rubbish.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The story follows Cletus/Carnage (Woody Harrelson) who escapes prison along with Shrieker (Naomi Harris) and causing mayhem. Venom/ Eddie (Tom Hardy) having to stop them before they go after him.The story is what you expect for this film. Continuing with Eddie and Venom being that bickering buddy couple. Sharing the same body. Sharing there perspectives and arguing during the situations. Even at one point they have a fight of trying to attack each other. When chaos is happening with Carnage. Who is menacing. They have to work together to stop it.The action is awesome. Carnage escape in prison is insane. The climatic fight between Carnage and Venom is a non stop thrill ride. The visual effects are amazing. The cast ensemble is perfect. Tom Hardy great as always. Woody Harrelson and Naomi Harris are fantastic. With a shorter run time. The film does waste no time with a fast paced direction.There is a mid credit scene that everyone will have a reaction too for a hint where Venom can go next.","44 out of 185 found this helpful.

The Venom franchise started off straying far from the badass anti-hero in the comics and gives us a goofier and almost incompetent take, which ended up being just fine. This follows it up, with on of the most infamous psychopaths in all of comics, Carnage, and it lets down worse than the first. The basic plot is a rom-com for Venom and his host Eddie, as well as a second rom-com story with Carnage and his lover Shriek. This leads to basic slapstick comedy that you have seen in 100 films better than this. If this was released in the late 90's, it would fit in perfect with the likes of Spawn and Robocop 3. In the modern day, there is no excuse for this type of watered down mess of a flick. Quality control is completely absent from Sony Marvel and it continues to disappoints time after time.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

He's a garbage person and a terrible actor. I'm tired of looking at his ugly mug of a face, his horrendous hook nose and underbite, his nappy teeth, and lastly his ear wrenching speech impediment and the way he talks.On to the garbage movie that this is cookie cutter band wagon movie is. Carnage is a ruthless, sadistic, serial killer in the comics, he's merely a puppy in this movie and to make it even worse, Woody Harrelson was cast as him. There's nothing redeeming about this movie minus a few good comedic moments, which is why I didn't give it one star. It's so intertwined with snowflake social warrior justice garbage propaganda that before this putrid bile and toxicity became intertwined in what seems almost if not EVERY MOVIE THAT COMES OUT THIS DAY IN AGE, the old cookie cutter assembly factory formulaic style movies were still tolerable and bearable to watch. Yeah you knew it was nothing new or ground breaking but you also knew what you were getting yourself into going to watch it. Some action, some comedy, a tried and true movie making formula that worked. Not anymore. These movies are so full of political PC snowflake garbage propaganda that now they are even watchable or enjoyable and just need to be done away with.Hollywood, quit trying to force your views and opinions down the country's throat using generic movies as your soapbox. You're ruining movies and everything that used to be enjoyable about them for everyone.So that all being said this movie is nothing special, like so many other movies of its kind unless you're just a hardcore fan of these, you can skip it and not be missing out on much of anything.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Given he was playing a supposedly scary character this made sense, the genuinely terrifying hairdo more than made up for an acting performance less Cletus Kassidy and more Cletus from The Simpsons.Stephen Graham swung for the fences with an elaborately tiered combover, starting at the back of his head but combining and curling in various places to form an exquisitely layered wave effect. Perhaps this combover was intended to convey the complexity of his character? Unfortunately his written dialogue and dodgy American accent sadly let the hair's performance down a little. I think the haircut may go on to better roles, it's young so hopefully it'll recover from this film.Tom Hardy, who I've loved in most films he's been in and who seems like a genuinely lovely man, sported a wet look comb-forward. A subtle effort in keeping with a man who has turned in some gloriously nuanced performances over the years. I'm not sure I would have noticed it had he not been acting alongside such glaring crimes against both growing old gracefully and forehead pride.Each of these actors have featured over the years in films and TV shows close to my heart. However, to call this film utter pap is unfair on pap. Thankfully it had a very short run time during which I was able to keep entertained by focussing on how intense the conversations between the hair stylists and the continuity team must have been from scene to scene. Must have been a long shoot for both parties and they deserve praise. Are there Oscars for hairspray application?","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

So a 3 is actually decent for these films.My biggest gripe with this film is the same as I had with the first one. It can't choose its audience. Is it for kids with its absolutely awful G rated, ""let's not offend anybody"" weak as piss jokes? Or is it for adults where we eat people's heads and use harsh profanities?The film chooses all of these options and does them all half assed. Disappointing everybody in the end.Venom used to be seen as a badass super villain that everybody used to say was their ""favourite Spider-Man villain"". Now he's basically a wimp who has the emotions of a 14 year old girl. The dialogue between him and Eddie is beyond cringeworthy. Not one joke landed in my cinema.The characters were all horrendous and I cared for none of them. Eddie's ex-fiancé's new fiancé helps out way too much and I suppose that really speaks to Marvel's true fanbase which are cucks.Shriek in the comics had unnatural chalk white skin and a Dutch last name. She's now black because (((woke elites))) really think that's important. Truly disgusting.In saying this, I took a Marvel fan with me and she liked it quite a lot despite the fact she couldn't tell me why. These films are designed for them. It's not clever, it's nothing new but it's action packed and a bit of fun.In conclusion, there's nothing new here. We fight a villain who does SLIGHTLY different things to the first villain. Nothing progresses. A weird, not funny but somewhat exciting film.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Usually the first one is meticulously written for realism and trying to make the comic book relative to the audience. Venom 1 was good in this aspect and makes the story, though completely sci-fi, somewhat fit in the suspension of disbelief. However, Let there Be Carnage completely failed in this regard and the whole thing came off like a cheap gimmick.What is worse is that the film tries way too hard to be a romantic comedy between Venom and Brock that it was just nonstop couple's drama with lame quirky jokes, talking, and just didn't have any real exciting moment or wow factor. Even when Carnage and Venom faced off in the end, it came off cliche, and predictable, and ultimately boring.It is a very boring and disappointing follow up despite my expectations were already low. None of that car chase scene through the streets of SF like in the first movie or the well choreographed fight scenes.It's a solid 4, meaning playing it in the background while you do other work.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was like a Michael Bay film, explosions, action, bullets, guns, smashing stuff, cgi, etc... I thought for some reason Woody Harrelson would make it better, but it did not. Worse than the first. It tried to be even more of an action movie without all the dumb ""comedy."" Well... it's still dumb, but without the ""comedy."" Its trying to make a hero out of Eddie or Venom even though it makes no sense.

Most new or unknown Directors lack the freedom to create a film from their mind's eye, because first the Producers believe in simple formulas to make a movie ""good"", Directors don't generally know the history of their subject matter (if it is a film about an already developed character), then of course the actors need direction, so much so that you must be able to communicate your wants effectively, and lastly some actors think they know it all and interject themselves in the writing process. Without spoiling the movie; some of these are evident within 'Let There Be Carnage'.Watching the movie, I think the audience noticed how quickly the movie seemed to be over. It was granted a meager 1:30:00 of film time, which leaves a lot of footage on the cutting room floor. The action is well paced, all though unnecessary & campy in some parts. I believe it's the result of Andy Serkis's direction, as he seems to enjoy big visuals more than plot details ... I defer to his other films as well. There's very little effort in character building as new recruit Shriek (played by Naomie Harris) was the plot coupon, as she was necessary as the motivation for Cletus Kasady (aka Carnage), but essentially irrelevant to the viewer. I like Naomie - I remembered her from '28 Days Later', Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, and the film 'Moonlight'. She's a very good actor, but here she isn't given the room nor depth to shine. It was odd seeing someone of her talent demoted to the background.Overall I found 'Venom: Let There Be Carnage' funny ... I'd rather an October release provide some scares, and I know this could have done that, but I honestly don't believe Andy Serkis can bring characters to life with his current directorial views. I may be wrong. There may be a 'Venom 2: The Director's Cut' sitting around like a Snyder Cut just waiting to be released. I found most of the action scenes to be long and unfruitful, like putting all your eggs in one basket. It ended quickly and left me feeling like this should have been a short story - A 3-minute feature to simply tie-in the upcoming Marvel Universe release of 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' - This had a great setup for a really good Halloween treat and I'm completely dissatisfied because somebody really dropped the ball here.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

I found the theme of the film appropriate: this series of events should be understood as a ""What If"", since the symbiote did not meet Spiderman, and in the comic I remember that initially the symbiote had developed a similar affection for its first host and and it was the double detachment (seen by the symbiote as treason) to generate the hatred that would have distinguished Venom.Since there is no catalyst for this hatred, this unfolding of events seemed consistent to me.I really enjoyed Hardy's performance, which throughout the film makes me see a character created in CGI as real, Harrelson also liked me a lot as Cassidy / Carnage, a little + down Naomi Harris but still valid.I conclude by saying that I found the film well balanced between humor (which in my opinion is plausible with this ""alternative"" Venom), action and violence.

I love how they decided to keep things an absolute train wreck, surrounding Eddie with all the mess that is his life now but somehow both Venom and Eddie make it work and I'm here for it; I am completely invested in their interactions as one individual per se, the connection between them definitely was developed on a deeper level in this moment and even though the movie doesn't develops the emotional part on the level that it was expected to be developed, they gave us an intense and immersive relationship.The film doesn't needs to be perfect, by being chaotic it gives the perfect balance between characters interactions and the plot.I can proudly admit that not only myself but the fans (mainly on tumblr) absolutely loved this movie for what it is: a chaotic masterpiece and we are thankful for everyone's hard work; Andy Serkins this was just *chef kisses*And oh boy, don't let me start talking about Tom Hardy; he completely understood the assignment and gave us the sweaty, greasy and messy Eddie Brock that everyone -and I mean EVERYONE- is in love with.Venom: let there be carnage offered an exquisite, turbulent and perfectly chaotic ride that I enjoyed to the very last second.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Fair enough. I personally found Woody Harrelson's acting thrilling as always. He was a villain that you loved while hating. Absolutely great design and acting, just good enough to root even more for Eddie and his alien parasite, and of course their marriage problems.Whether or not this passes the first one is entirely up to one's own opinions. I found they both had great charm.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's sad to see really great actors playing two dimensional comic book nonsense.

This is not one of those ""It could have been great if the director had tried"", this one was BEGGING to be epic. The previous film was praised for the chemistry Venom and Eddie had, and the funny sequences in which they had to live together were great. But this film turned that to 11 and straight up tried to be a sitcom for like the first hour of the movie. Then there is Carnage... could you imagine Carnage being like a sadistic baby? Calling Kassidy an his GF (who BTW had so little to do that I literally forgot his name) daddy and mommy? Could you imagine him toying with humans, or having daddy issues with Venom? Could you imagine him being funny or... interesting or... something? There was, SO many things one could have done with Carnage, but instead thy chose to do nothing. He has no personality, no motives, no nothing. It is just a Red symbiont, and it is defeated exactly as all the symbionts are. Hell, Riot had more character that him, and his personality was just being an Alpha. But worst of all, I think, was Eddie's character. He went from a down on his luck, renegade reporter, to a winning and complaining little annoyance. Narrative speaking, the fact that he is always stopping Venom from eating bad guys makes sense. After all, IRL eating humans is gross. But cinematically speaking, this makes Eddie antagonistic to the audience, since the only reason we are in the cinema is to watch Venom do cool stuff. Kassidy's half-baked, archetypical serial killer backstory was the most entertaining part of the movie, and that is saying something. Simply speaking, nothing happens in this movie. Venom and Eddie fight a little at the beginning, the Kassidy does a Bowser on Eddie, they fight, and that's it. Seriously disappointing...","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Nearly 30 min are an introduction and just Brocks daily life with his symbiote and his emotional and professional setting.It could have been just this - Eddie Brock and Venom, their relationship and how they come along. Would have been great.But this has to be a spectaculous sequel and with the teaser in the end credits from the first Venom movie, we know where it's going to go: Venom vs Carnage.Well... I'm not telling any Spoylers.This movie wants you entertain and it does, if you're not that picky about storytelling, character development, logic and something called suspense and surprise.The film is very straightforward in its narrative and follows its predictable plot points, resulting in a fairly short running time while trying to use the scenes as effectively as possible.Tom Hardy is great as Eddie Brock and does a really good job. The chemistry between him and Venom is hilarious, the depiction of their relationship is well executed and the fun parts work perfectly.The CGI is well done, too, but sometimes too fast, too chaotic.The movie wants to entertain, not more, not less, and I think, it does.It's not a drama, it's not about deepness in characters and it's not a character driven movie, it's a story driven movie.Skip some inconsistencies, some dubious motivations, some one-dimensional characterizations and take it as it is: funny, frenetic, dumb entertainment.Stay till the end credits, there comes an unmotivated teaser for the next Venom movie: Like I said, don't try to find logic in the storytelling, take it as it is and perhaps you might enjoy this second part.5 stars because of the high quality actors, the fun parts between Brock and Venom and the set design of the movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Not the best superhero movie out there but it was entertaining, so I was looking forward to seeing this one. Unfortunately this movie comes nowhere close to the first Venom in terms of quality. The jokes are so juvenile it's cringey, the storyline is muddled and too fast paced (it's only an hour and a half,) and and the villain is completely underwhelming. Carnage is an iconic character in the comics and this movie makes a fool out of him. The character known for brutal murders and unrelenting hatred creates a tornado by spinning around really fast and hacks government files by sticking his tendrils in a computer. It's a total joke and poor writing. On top of that, there is virtually no Venom action in this movie until the final half hour. As a sequel, we should have gotten at least a halfway decent movie, but the writers leaned too hard into jokes and the script could have been written by anyone. It's generic at best and a cringey nonsensical dumpster fire at worst.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Tom Hardy is still carrying this all on his back","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7592832/?ref_=tt_urv","MovieWarfare","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur112855274/?ref_=tt_urv","28 November 2021","The first Venom (2018) movie was a very generic and forgettable superhero movie. I came out feeling rather underwhelmed by it but I still had some expectations for the sequel since it teased the iconic villain, Carnage. The premise is ""Eddie Brock is still struggling to coexist with the shape-shifting extraterrestrial Venom. When deranged serial killer Cletus Kasady also becomes host to an alien symbiote, Brock and Venom must put aside their differences to stop his reign of terror"". So does it live up to the title or is just another mediocre movie from Sony?Firstly, Tom Hardy is still phenomenal as Eddie Brock and the voice of Venom. He still gives a very physically striking performance that is entertaining to watch. It is very clear that Tom Hardy is giving 100% and is also having a blast doing it. One of the most important plot points in this film is the relationship between Eddie and Venom and it is the biggest highlight. Eddie and Venom have a conflict that is similar to that of a rom-com. They are both arguing with each other, like a couple, on how they want to be a hero and how they want to live their life. It is so incredibly weird to see a man argue with an alien like they are married but it was so fun to watch.Just from the description above, it is obvious that this film leans more towards the comedy side while not taking itself that seriously. Notably, a lot of the comedic moments and jokes made me chuckle. This is thanks to some great writing and performance from Tom Hardy. The final fight is also a lot better than the previous film as this time, I could see what was going on thanks to the director using good lighting. Venom: Let There Be Carnage also has a very memorable mid-credit scene that is quite shocking and amazing.Unfortunately, it is quite bad when the mid-credit scene is the most memorable thing this movie has going for it. The actual plot is a very generic superhero affair that is no different from the first film. It goes through a lot of the same plot beats as Venom(2018). Eddie and Venom clash then they break up, the bad guy is Venom but evil, Venom and Eddie reunite to stop the bad guy. There is a rom-com plot with Eddie and Venom but that is very unconnected to the main plot of Carnage. The first 2 acts is just Eddie and Venom arguing with some carnage plotlines sprinkled in and then the final act with the fight. There isn't a real strong build-up for the fight between Venom and Carnage. Carnage hates Venom for literally no reason which makes the final fight feel less meaningful.Additionally, Carnage/Cletus is a forgettable villain which is such a shame considering how iconic and amazing he is in the comics. This film butchers him completely! What makes Carnage/Cletus great is how ruthless both of them are. They are both insane murderers and together they would rip spines and heads off. However, due to the PG-13 rating there never really is a sense of ""Carnage"" and it feels boring seeing them in action. For some silly reason, they give Cletus a love interest in Frances/Shriek who has screaming powers. Why does she have those powers? Who knows because they never bother to explain it. The film confirms that Cletus murdered her grandmother and her mother in cold blood yet make him somehow really loving of Frances. It completely ruins his character. She is also the second villain in the film and she is also a garbage character that I wish they removed from the film completely. Near the end, some really stupid things occur as well with a certain character pulling a 180 when it makes no sense for them to do so. They also include a line that tries to make Cletus sympathetic but it doesn't work when you show him murder an innocent guy earlier...There is also some returning supporting cast like Michelle Williams who they still waste in this film. There is also a new character Patrick Mulligan played by Stephen Graham who does a good job with what he is given but his character is very boring.Overall, I enjoyed it more than the first film but it certainly doesn't live up to the Carnage title. Thankfully, Tom Hardy is still enjoyable to watch and the movie is a lot shorter with its 90-minute runtime so it is not as exhausting to watch. However, it is still a shame that Sony still hasn't managed to create a great Venom movie but the mid-credit scene certainly makes me hype for a future movie even if this one was also quite generic.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Following on from their last outing in 2018 this 2021 film once again delivers action with a twist of dry humor as Eddie and Venom exchange conversations and attempt to figure out who is control of their co-existence while facing different challenges. This time their nemesis is Carnage, yet another symbiote which is co-existing with deranged death row serial killer Cletus Kasady (as hinted at in the first film). Kasady managed to get himself some alien symbiote action when he bit Brock during an interview. With his new alien superpowers Kasady escapes and causes... well... he causes lots of Carnage along the way. Hot on his tails, and Brock's too, is Detective Mulligan. Kasady is aided on his path of, err, Carnage by his former lover Frances Barrison/ Shriek who possesses superhuman screaming power.Right then, so we know Tom Hardy is back as Venom, he contributed more though because he helped with the story too. Woody Harrelson is Carnage/Cletus Kasady, Naomi Harris plays Frances Barrison/Shriek, and Stephen Graham is Detective Mulligan. They're all brought together under the directorship of Gollum; I mean Andy Serkis. Hardy is credited of working on the story with Kelly Marcel who also did the screenplay. That's a lot of big names already, there are more, and the crew and cast is big and has plenty of experience, so surely this anti-hero film must be good right, as good as the last one at least yeah. Well, I'm sorry, it felt a little weak and unmemorable truth be told. There were parts that were far-fetched, but in truth it was a very simple premises...Guy1/Symbiote1 (has superpowers) interviews Guy2 (serial killer) and accidently gives him Symbiote2/superpowers. Guy2/Symbiote2 uses powers to escape prison and cause Carnage. Guy1/Symbiote1 are having identity/co-existence issues. They must work through it to fight Guy2/Symbiote2.Sure, the story is weak, but then perhaps the action great, maybe the CGI is mind-blowing, perhaps the dialogue is rich, and the humor is dark?? Yeah... maybe don't hold your breath on that either. The action was pretty much rinse and repeat from the first Venom film or from any superhero film of the Marvel/DC cinematic era. If anything, it felt toned down, having read the comics the action is usually dark and nasty, this seemed to hold back.The CGI wasn't the worst I'd seen, but wasn't great either, there where scenes that were so obviously green-screened and filled with CGI that at times it put me off and became laughable. The dialogue was just enough to drive the film but not really that well thought out, there were times when Kasady was able to talk in detail about Brock's past, but they hadn't been life-long friends so how he knew that level of detail and intimacy was beyond me. I kept having to wonder if I had missed something. The fact that it just boiled down to a symbiote vs symbiote film like the first outing was a bit of a let-down - I can only assume this is because Sony, who own the rights here, can't go delving into the Marvel character database to give us something new.The humor? Ahh yeah, there are times that the Venom symbiote is supposed to be coming off as funny - it felt like too much dialogue was given to that character, and it didn't land well either. The scenes where Venom is without Brock and discovering himself and partying, it felt like that was added for kids to enjoy more than anybody else, but with a rating of censor rating of 15 I think it was still too weak.I'm sorry, I really hate being negative about this, but the film was a bit of disappointing mess. It felt like it had been rushed, chopped, changed, and then just put in front of the audience so they had something rather than nothing. Instead of ""let there be Carnage"" it felt more like ""let there be cringe"". One thing it had going for it though - at just an hour and half I didn't have to suffer that much. Damn it, I wanted to like this. 4/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

While the visuals were great (I particularly loved how the church scene looked), I didn't feel like there were any real surprises or twists in the plot. It felt half done, and far too simple. Usually I find these films follow a basic pattern: set up, minor confrontation, plot twist, character development, final showdown, plot twist leaving open for sequels. This movie however just didn't have the minor confrontation, plot twist, and character development. It jumped straight from set up to the big confrontation and defeat, which left me feeling like I'd spent hardly any time at all knowing Carnage and Cletus. It also made for a very lackluster defeat because there were no great hurdles to overcome, so there was no tension built. There was nothing technically BAD about what was in the movie, it was just lacking substance overall. All in all I felt this movie suffered from sequel syndrome - and I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The first movie really felt like a reprieve after a number of Marvel let downs, and this film took me back to that prior feeling.The CG, the cinematics, the scriptwriting etc. All lacked the polish and perfection of the first. While it contained all of the key elements and actors that made the first such a success, the execution just fell flat.Unlike some other reviewers, I think Woody Harrelson is more than capable of playing a villain and his character is more of a failure in scriptwriting than acting. The writers never really develope any interplay between Harrelson and his symbiote and he's thus not allowed to explore his character like Tom Hardy is able to.While it wasn't a complete bust and I would watch it again, it definitely feels like filler before attempting to complete a trilogy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I thought that after all these years people in Hollywood learned to create a pleasing visual spectacle over a story projected through the characters. Guess not.Another problem is the cuts and time-jumps. There was probably a lot more material, but in its current state, the scenes change so quickly with such jumps in time that it's often not clear how the characters ended up in a particular situation. I'm not even talking about ""why,"" as beyond explaining the basic rules, the characters don't express themselves in any way.Cletus kept saying what a dangerous killer he was, but in fact, he was just a bully, since the rating of the movie didn't allow him to be a real threat. It was nice to see the actress who played Calypso, but then again, she has no time to even talk in this film. Perhaps if you are more familiar with the source material, it will be easier to understand what these characters are supposed to represent, but to someone unfamiliar, it will be barely comprehensible in this CGI madness of a picture.At the same time, some scenes repeat things already said and understood by the viewer, just wasting time. Something clearly did not go according to plan during the preparation of the script, as the film keeps tearing up in different directions.I ended up not experiencing any emotion at all and will likely forget that I watched this movie quite quickly.Aside from a couple of good scenes, some nice visuals, and some good music (and a couple of action scenes), there was literally nothing in the film.The film could've been easily improved by adding more real destruction and violent scenes (reducing the amount of CGI madness), while still giving the characters a chance to be discovered through their actions.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

They are both in the city where the daily bugle. How can their pasts never have crossed since Tom Holland took OVER?????","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Now I know carnage isn't gonna be exactly how he was in the comic books. But this movie eventually with the others will have to fit in with the other marvel movies tone they set. A movie for everyone to see. It's still plenty violent and fun for anyone that enjoyed the first venom. Shows the relationship between eddie and venom. It's just a fun comic book movie.

Can we go for a PG level of violence for Carnage?""""Sounds a little intense, Bob, don't wanna scare the little ones out of buying action figures! We'll make sure there's no violence that wouldn't pass in something G-rated, but we'll get it a PG-13 so it doesn't feel like a kiddy movie.""""Won't the teenagers still think he's uncool, considering this is a movie about mass-murdering monsters that is significantly less violent than The Incredibles?""""Easy!

The dialog & writing is just terrible to begin with as well, and there are more plotholes & inconsistencies than I care to count.None of the jokes land, and very few got more than a smirk from me. Venom is supposed to be a dark character & Sony has turned him into a whiny loser. Same goes for Eddie - Eddie is meant to be an aggressive dark & twisted loner, not a bumbling loser. Their efforts to put their own ""creative spin"" on the characters fails in every aspect.Speaking of jokes - why are there so many? Venom wasnt created to be funny. There is absolutely nothing menacing about him at all in either of the Sony films. You can barely understand a single word Venom ever says without subtitles, which is frustrating.Also, Sony is very good at showing all the best parts of their movies in trailers leading up to release, so you can just watch the trailer & skip their movies basically. I feel this is going to be the case with the recently released 4 minute trailer of Morbius.Sony is not doing well with their spider verse movies save for the animated movie & I do not see light at the end of the tunnel for their live action interpretations of these characters.

The visualisation in this movie is pretty good and definitely illustrates the dark setting of this anti-hero type film. I have always thought as far as CGI goes they nailed Venom but i don't think i can say the same for Carnage.The dialogue in this sequel is definitely alot more cheesy but still alright to get a laugh. Tom Hardy does his job but there is definitely alot going on that feels forced. What can really be made out to be a disappointment is Woody's Carnage, I would say I had high hopes for his interpretation of Carnage but it was not great, definitely more of a writing issue. All up this is not a bad watch if you turn off. It was unfortunate that this movie could not go longer, there is so much story to be told between the characters Venom and Carnage and the pacing of the film just felt like the writers just wanted to be over and done with this one.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

When Carnage gains control over Cletus's body, he escapes from the prison.After seeing the name of Woody Harrelson along with Tom Hardy two of my favorite actors i was pretty excited and happy to watch the film but the film turned out to be an empty barrel with lots of sound from outside and nothing inside.The plot of the film is so predictable that if you anticipate any scene the very next moment the scene will be in front of you. It'll gives you a feeling that you've seen all the scenes of the film earlier and there is no excitement.The acting in the film is decent with Tom Hardy impressive in his character, Michelle Williams, Naomie Harris disappoints and Woody Harrelson underutilized.Screenplay of the film is also very predictable so as the climax.

With that said however it's fun to watch multiple high caliber actors just ham it up and have fun in these roles. If you were a fan of the first one, you'll likely enjoy this film. And while there is some charm in the goofiness and mindlessness, fans of the comics and Venom alike will probably still be wanting more than what we've received.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Some people liked it because it's funny-goof. No! I love it because it is so strong and phenomenal.Cletus Kasady has a reason to hate Eddie, he has his features and personality with a weird brain. Woody Harrelson neither had enough screen time, nor did that appealing acting, but he definitely fits his role.The Arcs were better, felt like a Venom movie more than the first one. The fight between Venom & Riot seemed stronger while Venom & Carnage was more satisfying since I was so excited for it and they didn't disappoint me.I like The Dialogues between Venom and Eddie. If you want to take their disputation as comedy or real, both ways worked good with me.Speaking of Comedy, This film is hilarious. A lot funnier than the first. Venom alone was so funny, mixing it with Tom Hardy's natural funny acting will bring you the best combo. That ""I'd love to see you in action"" was unnecessary it made some weird relationship between Venom and Annie. But overall the Comedy is Great!Direction & Visual Effects are certainly better than before. Haven't added too much light nor too much osts. The scene Venom stretching out of Eddie's body went so cool.The Best thing in this movie definitely without a doubt is Carnage. I cannot describe how much I loved the movie only by watching Carnage alone. I can't tell how much I loved the trailers only because Carnage is in them. His Design is perfect and more intimidating than both Venom and Riot. His Design, his voice, his character, his abilities. Every single scene includes Carnage was intense. Surely stole all the lights and compliments.This is exactly how I wished a VENOM franchise to be. They never failed to excite me and couldn't move my eyes off the screen. Thank you so much Sony for making this Masterpiece of a work. If you liked the first movie you'll mostly love this one.SOON COME CHAOS. CHAOS SOON COME.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

Somehow that was lost on this outing. I wanted to love it because the Carnage character is something I've wanted to see on the big screen and also, with Andy Serkis serving as director, that was something I held high hopes for. Sadly, none of this really hit the mark. Everything felt a bit too insincere. Missing intent. Confused. Haphazard. The back and forth between Brock and Venom became annoying quickly here and it just seemed over done. There were a lot of small things like this that just didn't feel right. Carnage himself was terrifying and impressive, but the inbetween parts didn't serve the characterization as much as I'd hoped.Overall, sadly disappointing.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It's a good thing I didn't go to the cinema. Only recently, good quality has appeared in the public domain.One thing is good - I slept well. In general, everything is stupid, unoriginal, in the style of the last film ""X-Men: Dark Phoenix"" (2019). In the middle, I was terribly sleepy and I snuggled down more comfortably. I woke up - I tried to watch the credits five times, I rewound all the time and barely mastered it. Very boring and uninteresting. There are no funny jokes from the word ""in general"". She never even smiled. The couple was more or less, but also so-so.This is really Venom 2, because there really were two things and the audience can watch the confrontation of two bright monsters). There is practically no logic and semantic load. The scenes are mostly dark. The bride of Venom is infuriating. They wrote that Tom Hardy looks old in this movie. I would say not just old, but hungover, especially in the opening scenes. Then the actor seemed to look healthier or just got used to his appearance.That's how Marvel rolled down, releases low-quality films under the guise and only disappoints more and more. Most of all, I liked the moment Venom drew, there were good shots of a fast bike ride and attempts at courtship of an alien creature. In general, Venom's character is captivating. Terrible and beautiful at the same time. It's a pity, the film was concocted in a hurry. The first part is also not a fountain, she was forgiven a lot, but the second one is not taken seriously at all.The film ""Venom 2"" in 2021 is not recommended for viewing. My rating is two stars. I throw one to the darling-Venoma for charm. Thank you for your attention to my review, I hope it was useful to you and helped you decide on the right choice. Watch interesting movies, it's a pity that lately Marvel has been increasingly allowing itself to have a viewer. It's almost stealing. My brain refused to accept the novelty and put me to sleep so as not to suffer). Even.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Second, how is it that Riot used more of Carnage's weapons in the first Venom movie than Carnage did in this movie! The love story was very out of character for him, and frankly unnecessary. If anything it took away from one of the things that makes him such a great villain.

Doesn't make it good, though, as that can only take the enjoyment to a certain degree before one start wishing there is a bit more substance in the script since it's more dumb than fun. The same camp-style can be kept but be a bit more clever with it.Tom Hardy was good as Eddie Brock yet again and is easily the best part of the movie, I just wish he had a better script to work with. The odd-couple schtick was fun for a while but then it went on for far too long and the overemphasis on comedy in this sequel detracts more than it adds. The lack of focus on the villain and rushing that plot point to get to the big CGI fight finale also hurts the overall experience. Woody Harrelson was hamming it up in the role with what he was given and he was fun with a layer of cringe.There were some cool/entertaining action scenes, the finale fight was certainly better than the first one. The movie, however, once again reinforces the fact that Venom SORELY needs to be Rated-R which would have made Carnage's carnage so much better. With the first one, I get that they had to make a safe play, but with the sequel, they should have embraced the violence.Not much else to say about this one. Kinda disappointed as I did like the first movie more which admittedly over time has fallen a bit in my eyes too. This character has a lot more potential than what we are being given and I hope whatever outing it gets next, it's done better. If you enjoyed the first one, you might like the sequel but if you didn't enjoy it, this won't change your mind. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 5.5/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This movie started at a 7/10. Since then, it feels like every day it has dropped 0.1 and I don't know why. I loved this movie. I loved the classic Eddie, Venom bickering, the action, the acting, and just like the first movie, I thought the plot was pretty cool. The Eddie, Venom bickering is classic and never fails to disappoint, every time they fight, you laugh. It is just funny. Their bickering also played a pretty big part in the overall story of the movie. The action in this movie was great. Definitely better than the first movie, and that is sayin something because the first movie had great action as well. The final battle scene stuck out for me, it was just so visually cool, and an overall great final battle scene. The acting was spot on. Tom Hardy is perfect for Eddie Brock, and was great as always, and the returning cast members played their roles great again. Naomie Harris was also great as Shreik, but Woody Harrelson was unbelievable. He was perfect, he played the deranged serial killer role to perfection, I couldn't have asked for anything better. Like I said, the plot of this movie, although short was pretty good. I won't get into detail, but it was very entertaining.In my opinion, this movie was better than the first one, but they were both great. I definitely recommend this to anyone, especially Marvel fans. I hate spoiling things, so I won't, but I will tell you there is a huge mid-credits scene. Make sure to stay and watch! It will 100% be worth it.","5 out of 17 found this helpful.

I didn't read the comics but he mostly just oscillated between making vague cryptic comments and whining about his childhood. You know what no film needs ever? A psycho killer whining about how he is the real victim somehow, unless your trying for a laugh even then it's a pretty mediocre joke at best. His character is not in anyway elevated by Woody Harrelson who is older than dirt and was given nothing to work with. He actually says ""Let there be carnage"" in the film which is not only predictable and idiotic but highly inaccurate. There was no carnage in this film... like anywhere. I doubt more than like 3 or 4 people even died. Woody Harrelson has, in my opinion, officially crossed that Tom Hanks line of appearing in so many things it's more irritating to see him cast in yet another movie than it is entertaining.Venom lost his edge. He is not even the PG-13 level of intimidating he was in the first one. He seems more like a neutered puppy than a powerful alien. He's just a mildly destructive, easily cowed, people pleaser. He's a built in assistant that Eddy treats like a nuisance. I think Sony needs to give Venom his balls back.The plot. Carnage wasn't the only thing lacking. We also get another psycho mutant X-men love story gone wrong. Underwhelming from start to finish. Even the battle between Carnage and Venom was a one and done. They could have squeezed in some more fight scenes because all this film boils down to is a good 3D animated fight scene and a decent 3D animated chase scene with some awesome pop out effects.I really enjoyed the first film but this is like ""Iron Man 2"" all over again.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The storyline from the comic had much to offer in the way of something quite cinematic. This movie should of been done better and should of been two parts. Venom wasn't able to defeat carnage alone and he definitely shouldn't of been killed off so easily. I was even let down with how they did shriek. Her ability to make people embrace their worse impulses could of been something to really play with. It was ok but to me it has very little replay value. I was excited to see venom brought to life.

Yes.Is it way better? Not really, no.The film has a very mediocre and simple story, the backstory of Cleatus and Shriek shows enough for us to understand the twos relationship but other than that, the two are very underwhelming in this film.The action also felt very mediocre, it was total mayhem (not in a good way). Carnage throwing things and people around like a 4 year old playing with Legos. Can't really see much of what's going on, the kills could have been a bit more brutal, even with the PG-13 rating in mind, keeping the action small and personal rather than large and loud. However the action at the end of the film was exciting compared to the rest of the film.Venom doesn't do much in the film actionwise, you don't see him fighting bad guys that often (until the end), but he still remained the highlight of the film, especially him and Eddie's relationship and the difficulty of two minds in one body.The film feels rushed in some places. Jumping from scene to scene and shot to shot, not letting the viewer savour or process the information told in the scene. The direction also feels very simple, there's not much attempt at creating suspense and fear in the film except 2-3 scenes.The writing as well is very simple. Silly and kiddish dialogue like ""I'm going to eat ur face off"" makes you laugh instead of cringe. Woody Harrelson had the potential of being a great carnage, but the writing didn't support it, making Cleatus a poet in the film and saying random things in the film. The same points follow with Naomi Harris as Shriek. Tom Hardy still does a stellar, and even better job of playing as Eddie and Venom.At the end, the film feels very forgetful, nothing very memorable from the film compared to venom 1. If you really enjoyed the silliness, the comedy, and the mayhem of the first film, this one is for you. If you enjoy the darker themes of venom, and are hoping for a more brutal and darker take on the character, don't expect too much of that. If you didn't enjoy the first movie, skip on this one.But don't forget, what is potentially, one of the most mindblowing post credit scenes, which had to make me bump the score of the film from a 5 to a 6.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

""Venom - Let There Be Carnage"" is straight up eye candy and CG action sequences set against a rather generic plot and subpar acting. If I was 10 years old, I would've loved this and talked about it with all my friends, but ... that I am not.We catch up with Eddie Brock and his symbiote, Venom, as they are adjusting to everyday life together, much like two new roommates would. Eddie is asked to interview an imprisoned serial killer named Cletus Kasady, and while they're there, Venom is able to figure out where he hid the bodies of his victims, which leads to Kasady receiving the death sentence. Before he is executed, Kasady asks to see Eddie again, but this time, he finds out about Venom ... and during an altercation, Kasady gets some of Eddie's blood on him ... and Carnage is born.The whole premise of this movie was to have fun with computer graphics to give us onscreen representations of both Venom and Carnage that any 8 to 12-year-old would say is ""cool"". We have a cute little side story of the bond of friendship between Eddie and Venom, as well as another one with Eddie learning to accept the fact that Anne is moving on to be with another man. The final climactic confrontation wasn't anything special, just like the movie itself.I can't recommend this one. It wasn't a bad movie, but it doesn't measure. No thinking required ... just bring in your soda and bucket of popcorn and check out for 97 minutes. It is a nice diversion until the next actual good superhero film comes out. This gets a paltry 5 stars out of 10. No more, no less.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

To me, Venom sequel tasted a little better than the first movie but frankly it's no masterpiece. Good to spend an hour and a half, and that's all. Average acting due to Tom Hardy's performance, the movie is filled with funny dialogue, some action, zero violence, all coming out from a script that's a total mess... rushed and frantic. Carnage and Cletus are weak, undeveloped antagonists, there's a major plot hole in the final showdown you must ignore in order to accept whatever reason Venom turned out victorious in the end.Movie would had come out much better if it had been centered on the everyday dramas and struggles of a man and his alien symbiote partner, both lost in their own thoughts while sharing a body and home in a big city. Jeez, saying it loud sounds like the deformed cub out of the twisted relation between Sex and the City, Friends and Two and a Half Man on a scifi take .Best thing is the post-credit scene, believe me.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, it did not capture the audience's hearts in terms of epic action, instead turning into a romantic comedy that tells the story of two distinct species that do not appear to be suitable, but they fit well. In my opinion, venom 2 is not a nice movie at all. It's all twisted and disorganized. It tells the story so quickly that we don't understand it. But it's true that this film succeeds at jokes and humor. So people who like Venom in the first episode would probably enjoy this one as well. Those who didn't enjoy the last film would most likely dislike this one too, Since it isn't all that different from the previous one It's a fun action film with an excellent battle sequence. In terms of actors, this movie includes a variety of talented actors. However, because the storyline moves too quickly, it lacks of significant characteristics of the characters, particularly the main character and antagonists. They are not explored as thoroughly as they should be, but the finest part of this movie is the end credits, which I believe make it worth to see.Summary, The entire film is focused on building up to the final fight, which is unsatisfying. Yes, it is a crossover between two popular comic book characters, but that is all it offers. The antagonist is uninspired and unappealing.The plot is hurried, boring, and uninspired in every way. Because the script lacks content worth meditating on, there are no personal moments to enable things to be interested in. For me Venom 2 is kind of a dissapointmentOverall Score: 5/10.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I want to start from the good parts of the movie, and by saying that tom hardy is one of the best actors of this generation. He performs in any style of a movie or series and always manages to steal the show. In addition, the relesionship between Venom and eddie broke in this movie is pretty good and pleasant to watch. I am really sorry to say this but now the goods stops and i start complaining. The first movie was super small in duration but i made an ecuse to that because it was the first and they propably didn't believe that there was gonna be a second one. However now that the second one is out, is actually more small than the first one. Unfortunalty as much as i love andy sercis as an actor he seemed to just execute orders from others and not giving to the movie his character. For some reason Venom 2 instead of being an action dark and even a light horror movie it is a bad written comedy show for children. The humor of the movie don't work all the time and most jokes are childish. The villan was way better than the first one but again poorly written. The new screaming lady had no interest and Ann was once again boring to death. I don't want to say that the olny reason that someone should go to see Venom 2 in the theaters is the after credit scene, but sadly this is the truth.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Woody Harrelson makes a great villain.There is no forced love interest for Eddie this time around, which leaves more time to flesh out Cletus (Harrelson) and his motivations.As others have indicated, there is some repetition. The conflict in both movies is symbiote vs. Symbiote and the cast is nearly identical to the first movie. However, this movie has a more entertaining story and Harrelson makes a much better villain than Riz Ahmed.Be sure to stick around for all the post-credits scenes - if you aren't excited about the MCU after watching this movie, then you don't have a pulse!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

But at its core, beneath the wacky quips and gnashing teeth and gobs of goo, it's something else entirely: a love story. Not between Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock and Michelle Williams as the one who got away, not even between Woody Harrelson's villainous Carnage and Naomie Harris' misunderstood mutant Shriek, but rather between Eddie and the hulking symbiote dwelling within him, Venom. It may sound insane to ponder notions like vulnerability and tenderness given that we're talking about a movie in which a preening alien lives inside an intrepid reporter, bickering and bantering with him in the growl of a diabolical Cookie Monster (also Hardy, having a ball). Hardy shares story-by credit with returning screenwriter Kelly Marcel-who, by the way, was wise enough to mine ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" for its inherent, absurd humor. While the bondage gear here may seem appropriate, ""Venom"" offers a very different kind of complicated, intimate relationship. Cletus' transformation into the red-hued Carnage-a larger, fiercer, and more weaponized version of Venom-is a frenzy of sound and fury. It's also the first sign that the action in this sequel isn't going to be nearly as compelling as the comedy. But what both of these scenes reveal is the softer, sweeter side of this symbiote, and the unexpected affect he's had on people beyond just Eddie. They hit harder than the grandiose moments in which the giant black and red blobs hurl themselves at each other in mid-air. But don't get too comfortable with the idea of a cuddly, cozy Venom. As the end credits remind us, there are always more movies in store.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Because of that you don't want to criticize the plot as mush as you'd want with the first one.Pretty much every Venoms interaction with Edie is very fun and there is a lot of it. Venom by himself is also just charming. Aside from that there is not much to praise. Woody Harrelson felt a bit off for the role, and the Kasady's character wasn't really interesting and convincing. His love interest is even duller then he himself. I feel like Kasady is a missed opportunity, but it doesn't ruin the film at all.Edie is fun, Venom is fun and they are on screen almost all the time. I'm very surprised this movie is so decent. Just expect a good comedy going to see this movie.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

However, it's a rocky relationship, to say the least. Brock also attempts to revive his career by interviewing Cletus Kasady, a serial killer who doesn't trust anyone else. But things go wrong when Cletus also gets infected with a deadly and bloodthirsty symbiote. Brock must quickly find a way to work with Venom and deal with the Carnage brought on by Kasady.Although the plot is pretty straightforward for a comic-book flick, the banter between Brock and Venom is often the film's most fascinating element. Brock is constantly trying to quench Venom's thirst for, well, brains, leading to some amusing exchanges - even if the humour won't necessarily satisfy everyone's taste. Nevertheless, Tom Hardy's performance with the CGI character carries the film through some rough patches. Like Hardy, Woody Harrelson fully embraces the film's quirky, often absurd tonality and certainly enjoys playing the antagonist. Together, they make some of the apparent plot holes easier to ignore.Learning from its predecessor's mistakes, the runtime is certainly breezy at an hour and a half. But this does a disservice to its secondary characters Anne Weying (Michelle Williams), Francis Barrison (Naomie Harris) and Patrick Mulligan (Stephen Graham). They have potentially intriguing roles but don't get much development beyond some hasty plot beats and they end up being the story's weakest links. In addition, the editing is slightly jumpy in places, indicative of significant trimming, although this isn't entirely distracting.The third act is definitely satisfying once the two sentient aliens finally battle it out. There's a substantially marked improvement in the CGI over the first film, as the experience of director Andy Serkis clearly comes in handy. The action is easy to follow and looks great in 3D without being overbearing. While the film meets the basic requirements for comic-book movie enjoyment, its most essential sequence is the post-credit scene that raises the bar for the Venom character. Not only does it change the scope for where he and Eddie Brock will show up next, but it also makes this problematic yet oddly entertaining sequel more than worthwhile.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

So many here say it had no plot or if it did have any, it was a mess none could make any sense of. Well the movie I saw had a very straightforward plot which I followed without any difficulty and the people watching it with me didn't seem to complain. Yes I do agree, the acting was top notch. I will mention Tom Hardy who does superbly as Eddie Brock, and seems to be the voice of Venom too, which is one of the best voice acting I've seen (or heard) in a very long time. Another one that deserves mentioning is Woody Harrelson who seems to enjoy playing psychotic killers and gives a stellar performance as the tormented but utterly deranged Cletus Kasady. All the others are very good too or at least very professional. The movie follows the first installment's most important aspect (in my personal book) that is the savage nature of Venom is here straight from the comics books just as he was originally conceived and for me, that deserves special appreciation. The writers and creators of this movie, like those who started the franchise do understand the nature of the beast - the entire thing wouldn't be worthy of our time without this understanding.Regarding the sense of humor demonstrated throughout the movie - it's always very dark and wry humor, never a LOL but rather some wry smiles or maybe a chuckle here and there. I don't think LOL comedy would suit this movie, while the wry dark humor suits it to perfection.Bottom line - that's Venom - violent, savage, dark and maybe a bit chaotic, but not in a way that makes it impossible to follow and understand. That's the nature of the beast, as I said already - the entire movie makes sense only this way and I like it if only for the fact it dares going through with this bizarre type of hero all the way.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I told them I was going as a labor of love because I hated the first movie, which I have now seen 3 times (thanks Covid). I ended up liking this movie a lot more than I expected. The story line was very simple which was a refreshing change. It was also 90 minutes, and maybe reminded me of the movies of my youth. No need for Venom to get beat, then rally, then have an epic overly long fight scene. So to the movie creators- thank you- this was a pleasant surprise. Woody Harrelson was also superb. My only criticism is the movie assumes I know things that I don't. I was confused about where Carnage came from, why he called Venom dad and why he hated Venom. I had to Google the back story later but I don't think that should be necessary- and if they needed 10 minutes to insert Comic Books for Dummies 101 for people like me they had time. Maybe it's because we just watched Jungle Cruise, but the CGI in this was very fluid and never distracting. All in all it was an easy, fun night out with the fam.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Eddie decides to revive his failed career, by interviewing notorious serial killer, Cletus Kasady(Woody Harrelson). Kasady becomes Carnage, during a prison break & following a botched execution attempt. Venom has to stop Carnage's rampage, no matter the cost.Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a brilliant film. Director Andy Serkis has masterfully taken over directorial duties from Venom(2018) director, Ruben Fleischer. This movie has doubled down on all the elements that made the 2018 original, entertaining. The one-liners will make you laugh raucously. It has also given us a much better villain who has more depth than Riz Ahmed's Carlton Drake/Riot from the previous film. The action set pieces are superb. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. I definitely still miss the lack of a connection to Spider-Man. Tom Hardy is spectacular as Eddie Brock/Venom. Hardy's physical performance is one of the highlights of the movie. Woody Harrelson is outstanding as Cletus Kasady/Carnage. Harrelson has made the long wait for the iconic Spider-Man villain to appear on the big screen, worth it. Michelle Williams is excellent as Anne Weying. Naomie Harris is fantastic as Frances Barrison/Shriek. Reid Scott is great as Dr. Dan Lewis. Stephen Graham is good as Detective Mulligan. Peggy Lu is awesome as Mrs. Chen. The supporting cast is impressive. Venom: Let There Be Carnage is a must watch for Venom(2018) fans. Don't miss the mind-blowing mid-credits scene!","6 out of 37 found this helpful.

As a big Carnage fan since I was a kid, this didn't disappoint. Every scene of Harrelson turning into Carnage gave me major The Thing vibes and never got old. I only wish there was more on-screen violence and gore, which was due to the PG-13 rating, something I didn't even know until after the movie. While a big disappointment there, it nonetheless didn't keep me from enjoying it. Harrelson was especially entertaining as Cletus Kasady, and Stephen Graham was a nice addition. The humor throughout never felt forced or cheesy, unlike parts of the first. The post-credits scene gives me new hope for the future of Venom, but sadly I won't hold my breath for another R-rated installment.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

He wants to get his career back on track with an interview with serial killer Cletus Kasady who is played by Woody Harrelson. During the interview Cletus bites Eddie Brock and Venom's blood becomes a host in Cletus to become Carnage. He escapes from prison after a failed execution to be with his love Frances Barrison played by Naomie Harris who is trapped in a mental hospital because of her own powers.

But if I had to lean on one side of either good or bad, I'd say this movie is more good than bad.My one big problem with this film is its runtime. This movie is nowhere near long enough to be fully satisfying. This movie had a lot going for it, the big thing being Carnage's live action debut, but its runtime is bugging me. Only 90 minutes? For a movie like this?It really feels like a lot was cut out when watching this movie. Like there were so many scenes that could've easily been in two but were mushed together to reduce the runtime. Any kind of subplot was extremely subtle and very quickly lead right back into the main plot.Other than that, this movie mostly surprised me with how entertaining it was. 8/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It still kinda has that retro 80's-90's hero-film-vibe. They even kinda poke-fun/nod toward fan reception of this (regarding the first film). There's not much drag; the plot struts along rather fluidly. It's fast paced; You don't really have to pay attention to know what's going on. It just romps along.Woody pops up as Carnage pretty quickly and boy do they nail his character. The way he moves on screen is a real treat; the cgi did not disappoint. Screech or shriek.. shrek...eh? Yeah, eh. She was fun... but they probably could have fleshed her character out a lil' more. She seems only to exist in order for Woody to obsess over.. and vise versa? Not a huge problem.. but there just wasn't much depth there. Conversely, Eddy and Venoms relationship felt as traumatic.. but it was layered.. and that was fun. Their lil' breakup about midway through felt a lil' forced. But yeah.. same problem as Woody and shrek.. plot device. Eh, shrugs.The comedy spritzed throughout was so much fun. Venom's personality just takes over. There's a bunch of silly lil' quotable quatables. Good stuff.As everyone else has echoed... the post credit scene filled me with gleeeee. Big part of that glee comes from the fact that i realllly enjoy Venom's character & wanna see more.. this movie does a good job of making the ""Lethal Protector"" into a fan favorite.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The soundtrack was spot on wonderful all throughout the movie and the performances, especially the symbiote voices were stellar.However, the one that really steals the show is Woody Harrelson, be it as Carnage or as Cletus, his flawless line delivery and a dynamite performance give this movie a big boost.There are a few flaws of course, like the Naomi Harris's almost useless character existing for the sole purpose of being a plot device and some weird editing cuts.Overall, script is much more tighter this time around and the acting of the whole cast has improved drastically, visual effects are better and so is the action. If you're looking for a fun popcorn movie and are somewhat invested into the mythos of these characters you won't regret spending your money on this one.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Maybe, it is not, to children whose parents were not of reproductive age the last time Woody portrayed a serial killer with a sense of humor and crazy ideals. I find it viciously funny. But, then, these kids did not see Woody in Taxi. Or NBK. Or White Men Can't Jump. Their first experience with him was Zombieland. And they have no idea why he is funny, because they are children. He was hilarious in Zombieland. What these little kids are mentally incapable of understanding, is that he is always funny. Tom Hardy plus alien symbiote? Hilarious. Woody Harrelson plus homicidal alien symbiote? Mickey would be proud.Venom plus.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I've never been an enormous fan of Woody outside his humorous stoner quips, but his opening scene? I KNOW THOSE PSYCHOPATHS! And his acting was something that gave me an entirely new appreciation in that moment on a gawd-dayum Heath Ledger scale which I do not use lightly by ANY MEANS! The factors I go by after that initial moment ARE:
DOES THIS follow the Hero's Journey BEFORE it was even recognised? 100%.DOES it follow the original story? Is it the proper adaptation? 120% more than most of The KING OF NOVEL-to-CINEMa Stephen King- who would admit himself on poor past adaptations~
However, though VENOM:Carnage cut through a few potent factors, considering time & mind? I consider this one of the best ACTED Lee flicks of the ""Marvel Universe"" being that it is just as singular as our ORIGINAL IRON MAN..... there is NO discounting the amazing forethought & talent here, even if cheese was added for the ""male 18-35"" crowd. Accept your audience & play to them, but stay true to your art.Something a 96 yr old man fought his entire life with gusto & bravery to achieve, & enlightened all of our hearts...
I will never have the kahones to even equal this gen-defying KING among humanity. If anyone cannot see one of 10,000 msg's here? I am sad for all of humanity.Dear Mr. Lee: the life lessons, the mythos, psychology & philosophy perhaps unwittingly brought together to teach so many generations simply how to be human through comic-&-film? Thank you,and excelsior! My dear mentor to so many, bright blessings throughout your ongoing journey.The extinguishing of your light here will be forever felt & missed in my gen & above. You will never know the path you left, or the positive influence you left on so many souls prayers upon your further adventures you, above all you have written ARE, the AMAZING HERO🙏👏👏","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Because we understand their inner struggle and desires we know how much harder it is on them in the external world and the plot.The way that we go through the inner narative of brock and venom, in parallel to developing Cletus's romantic relationship to Shreik and his symbiotic relationship to carnage, is a great way to show parallel script writing and use of cinematic editing to develop the converging Anti-hero's journey to battle his Son and nemesis.The father son relationship between carnage and venom, and the toxicity that is made of all the characters with incompatible relationships, is a great way to build up the tension throughout the film before the final battle and convergence of all conflicts from the parallel stories.Venom is struggling to be compatible with his symbiotic host brock, as is Cletus and Carnage. Venom is struggling with his ex as she is about to marry someone else and he still hs feelings for her. And Cletus is forcfully kept away from his one love as he desperately want to break himself and her free from the shackles of the government. All these toxic relationships and the final battle at the end of this film gives the viewer a satisfying ending. Not to mention the excitingly news in the post credit scene.This film deserves 5 stars for its parallel story structure and great character development along with cinematic cross editing between unfolding character plots that ultimately converge for an final epic battle.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The comedy was legend. Venom and Eddie Brock's relationship had me laughing. It was like Eddie Brock was living with a toddler who needed constant praise and attention. Wanting to be the hero and if it couldn't, it would go into a tantrum. But when I heard the F-bomb thrown into the dialog, I knew this couldn't be a Disney/Marvel movie. Sure enough it was a Sony Columbia Pictures film. I don't care what the haters will say, but comic book films are so much better with dark comedy -- at least for adults.If I had to say which few comic book movies I liked, this one would be right next to Deadpool for its funny and dark humor. The film almost didn't need Woody Harrelson and Naomie Harris; if only for the only reason Venom needed an antagonist to battle.Just one thing, Anne Weying is the worse lawyer ever. She tells Eddie to tell the cops the whole true and everything. Damn, that's a lawyer you don't want representing you.All of the actors gave good performances, especially Tom Hardy. Hardy really did great considering he was probably acting against a blue screen most of the time and made it believable.","1 out of 18 found this helpful.

Venom thankfully has a lot more screen time and Carnage has plenty!

The Venom movie is almost the only one of the Marvel movies that I liked. I watched this movie completely by accident. My boyfriend said we're watching this movie today. And even though I don't like Marvel, I agreed. In the end, I would even like to reconsider. This is a very interesting film, although fantastic, it makes you think about something. I like the main characters so much, Tom Hardy is in my heart. His black second personality is very funny. Every time he says something, then you laugh for a very long time. There are a lot of jokes and funny phrases in the film that you can remember and use in the future. The details of the film are very professionally executed, very colorful. Thanks to this, it is very interesting and pleasant to the eye to look at. A balm for the soul from the life values of the heroes. I am amazed at the director's thoughts. After all, it took so much imagination to come up with such a legendary film. My respect to the director.Cancer is a terrible disease, I will not recommend it to anyone, I am very sorry for the hero. This is a huge pain for a loved one and himself. It is a pity that in our time there is still no quick and simple cure for this terrible disease.A movie about super abilities. Each of us in childhood would like to have some kind of ability or have a magical power. I would like to have such a friend myself, so that he would always be with me and never be bored. So he also has great power. The main thing is not to quarrel with him
in general, this movie is insanely interesting. And if you doubt whether to watch it or not, then do not hesitate and watch.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Even if we compare the latest Marvel films, the same ""eternal"" ones -it was really tough, and I wanted to leave the hall, the last scenes were completely shocked.Here it was the opposite. Venom is one of my favorite characters in this comic book series. The second part never loses the first one. It had everything: funny jokes, an interesting plot, Woody Harrelson as a villain. It was interesting to watch the interaction of the characters. Revenge, duty, friendship, love, quarrels-all this was in this film adaptation. Tom Hardy, as usual, coped with his role wonderfully. I don't understand those who say that the second part was boring. I don't agree at all. Probably, people just have problems with taste.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

To cover all the get-togethers, melodramatic showdowns, gay-bromance conflicts, references to past parts of the universe and a bunch of other details and storylines, most of which do not make the slightest sense, you will have to spend a third of the film (and it, contrary to the trends of modern film comics, goes a stingy hour and a half). In the final scene of ""Venom 2"", the creators self-ironically compare movie comics (and in particular their film) with soap operas. If it is harder to find echoes of a ""Clone"" or a ""Wild Angel"" in complex and much more ""correct"" from the point of view of academicism in Marvel plots, then a new chapter about the difficulties of relations with the cosmic symbiote itself writes a confession. Some here take revenge after decades (it suddenly turns out that Yelp knows the annoying detective Mulligan and wants to settle scores with him), others, obeying the complex of a wayward son, decide to challenge the pope (for Carnage Venom is a symbolic, paternal figure, if you like), others... Still others do not even hide their gay bromance: the relationship between Brock and the symbiote has finally lost the small-scale heterosexuality of the first part, and even the authors have begun to irony over the feuds of this young couple.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie is a must see for fans who enjoy superhero/action or just those looking for a good laugh.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The meshed character of Eddie Brock linked with the symbiote that calls itself Venom and their personal battles is well done. This is not a perfect film. Story, plot and script improvements would have been a game changer. I keep saying that the producers need to push for more experienced directors for projects of this magnitude. Tom Hardy is a very talented actor. So give him a director that knows what he/she is doing. Andy Serkis is very good at what he does, but he wasn't ready for the pressure of bringing the beloved Carnage to the screen.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It is got fewer to do with being a hero beating bad guys saving the world and stuff, but more about human conditions and emotions. My favorite scene is when Eddie was heart broken by the fact that Anne was going to marry Dan, venom tried to cheer him up in the morning by cooking and doing the chores. It is full of companionship and so very warm. Eddie as a character is easy to relate since he is not nearly perfect. He hurt venom when he was hurting, which is ugly but also very easy to relate. So mostly the plot is one of a love story and the movie brought a smile on my face. For a marvel hero movie, I can ask no more.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

You will never be bore, if they both are on the screen together.PRESENTATION - movie's presentation is good in some scenes, specially during the carnage entry.COMEDY - as i said earlier that relationship of venom and eddie is amazing. I think venom alone is enough to make you laugh.Negatives :-VILLIAN - in every superhero movie, we expect a powerful villian. But this movie failed this task. I am unable connect with villian.CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT - the main reason of weak villian is its Character development. This thing is missing from this movie except for some characters - eddie.STORY - story of the movie is very short and simple. It is not so much Impactful. There are no twists at all.CLIMAX - climax of the movie doesn't feel like a climax. I mean, what do you expect from a climax scene, - a mind blowing fight between superhero and villian. This movie have that kind of action scene, but due to weak character development, it was unable to make a greater impact on minds of audience.CARNAGE - the origin of carnage was happened due to blood of eddie brock. This concept is very basic and doesn't fit in superhero movies. It seems little bit illogical.Also the death of the carnage is so simple and basic.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Now, to find redemption and put himself on the map, Eddie secures a rare interview with the unhinged death-row prisoner, Cletus Kasady: a violent, sadistic serial killer left to rot in San Quentin State Prison. However, as bickering Venom grows increasingly tired of depending on a strict bland diet, Anne is determined to move on with her life, and an unforeseen complication gives birth to a new nightmare and a fierce, unstoppable arch-enemy. Is the world prepared for the advent of Carnage, a red-hued beast with a mind aflame with madness, wrath, and chaos?This movie was no doubt way better then the first film as there is a lot more action involved.I do like the whole bond between Eddie and the Symote in this film.If you loved the first movie you will no doubt like this one too.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I watched the first and this one back to back. Thank you STArZ! Tom Hardy is such a charm. I believe casting Woody H. As Cletus was the greatest decision Hollywood has ever made alongside casting Hardy as Eddie/Venom. They both deliver and I thought the combination of the two and their dynamics on the screen together worked perfectly. They both were able to tap into what makes their character unique and were able to bring them to life.(no pun intended lol). I'm very happy with the diversity of the film in casting and character. I like how it was filmed being different than the regular ol superhero smash hit wonder. It's a film with a antihero who struggles with the duality of the gift that has been given to him. I would love and very much enjoy seeing a third installment to see where these characters can go. In all I thought the movie to be fun and funny. The comedy for what it was is good. I got quite a chuckle especially since I struggle with voices in my head from time to time. I think they captured the true essence of the struggle within oneself. Very impressed with the results. Great job, Hollywood! You've got my attention to where I started watching movies again. Thank you to the whole team that brought these movies to life. I tip my hat to you! -Josh.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

If you haven't watched the first one, it would be better to watch it first, because then the plot of the second will be revealed to you to a greater extent. The second part of Venom seemed too short to me, it looks like a breath, but due to the fact that tension is maintained throughout the film and it is very dynamic, this is not a minus. I also liked the reference to Spider-Man at the end of the movie. I recommend everyone to watch the perfect movie to watch in some short evening, because the movie is less than two hours long. Watch this movie and you will understand how great it is.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Venom. Carnage. Need to be a litte more graphic. Maybe Sony and Disney/MCU want to keep this all PG-13. But still. You have villainous characters that people who read the comics want to see on film.Sure they have ""Across the Universe."" A sequel to a superb initial way of what Sony has.But think about the back and forth. Yeah. Spiderman is superior when Disney/MCU came out when Sony let them have a go. But Sony has rights. Willing to work with MCU/Disney. All of a sudden. Blockbuster hits. In two movies. A third is coming allowing a lot of cooperation between the two. Which is gonna kill.On a point. Spiderman into the spiderverse ruled. But the sequel across the universe will be cool I hope too bc miles morales.Sony should stop and negotiate keeping rights limited within reason their animated movie that killed. I anticipate that spiderman will be fought between universes.What I think is sony should leave spiderman to the mcu where they have a lot of persons to see it through the right way.Seen too say other studios mess up the way it should be shown. By studios not trusting what they do bc of their means.Give it to where marvel and disney are making it in ways where we watch other movie studio renditions. And they have and a bunch of them sucked. To where a fan of marvel. And DC. They get the right creative control. They make a good movie without studios messing it up.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I find the film quite relevant in our time, because our century is a breakthrough in the field of psychology.Despite all the fiction, I saw in it a reflection of psychology, religiosity. Venom is a symbol of a person's faith in himself, at least, this is proved by scenes where the main character is without an alien. The author wants to show that the symbiote is a part of each of us, and only how we use it, and what is embedded in our brain and is a projection into our reality. No wonder Cletus is not that disliked, but a raped and murdered child, who has accumulated all the anger in himself and spreads it to everyone. The internal conflict born in childhood, especially, is shown in the scene with Karnash, where he could not overcome Venom. The internal conflict turned into an external one, which killed Cletus and Karnash. Only in harmony with yourself can you achieve victory.In addition to the block ""all the problems from childhood"", the film also reflects the block ""the ability to keep positive inside yourself"". Two destinies with criminal similarities grow up with different worldviews.Another interesting fact: it is not for nothing that Venom feeds on brains, because brains are the center of self-belief, which once again proves the self-confidence of the symbiote.I think the film deserves attention for its psychological and philosophical idea.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie was exactly what I expected it to be, action packed fun with an interesting enough plot.Only reason I would have to rate the movie lower than 10/10 would be sub par cgi and not enough action and humor.As you can see by my rating my needs for a movie in this genre were met..","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Even a talented actress like Michelle Williams wastes her talents on this time-killer, hardly worth mentioning in her resume of quality movies and performances.But watching Woody Harrelson with a brand-new rug lending himself to the nonsense was more than I could stomach. As far as the story goes, it has about as much creativity and credibility as those Chick-fil-A commercials mocking burger joints with pleas to eat more chicken. Childish.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Seeking a career boost Brock elects to conduct a one-on-one with certifiable Cletus Kasady, a serial killer imprisoned in San Quentin who's still pining for his one bright light. This piles on the visual effects (mostly fighting among the goo) but the script is bland and there isn't enough of a story to move things along or make it interesting. Serkis is going for a mix of off-the-wall humor and edgy action but never hits a stride, plus the chaotic final act doesn't provide any suspense or thrill. Hardy looks like he could implode at a moment's notice, while starry-eyed Harrelson channels Mickey Knox, but the messy results of this jerry-rigged fiasco aren't funny or exciting. *½","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
