And I wasn't a fan of using classic rock tracks for a lighter tone, something we're more likely to see in a Marvel movie.6) Half the time I was invested, the other half I was unengaged and didn't care.I had an okay time wit this movie. It benefits from IMAX with the expanded aspect ratio for the entire movie. But in the biggest IMAX around, there were a total of 8 people in my theater. DC seems to have alienated its die-hard fans.(1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 12/21/2023)","332 out of 401 found this helpful.

But the superhero age is over and we are tired of the same old stuff. Aquaman requires Avatar level Graphics. You can't do aquaman on a budget because it looks cheesy and fake. Acting by Momoa is great as usual. The brother thing worked well. But like i said it's all been done a hundred times now. The worst part is that these studios aren't getting the point. You need a script that's original. CGI has to look real and good. There's no real audience for this stuff anymore. But the companies don't seem to get it, I guess they'll keep doing them until there bankrupt. Oh well.","58 out of 71 found this helpful.

Format: Regular TheatreA script that doesn't have any story to hold it tight together. It's a very interesting story that discusses many aspects like family, brotherhood, fatherhood, and leadership. But, perhaps this was its core problem, that it was trying to be so many things at the same time. At times i didn't know where the story was heading which made the story jump from discussing topics like fatherhood to an adventure with two brothers who had beef in their past. The film is unfortunately a typical superhero film in terms of expecting what's coming next from events, and sequences.On top of that and with all the chaos, the film re-discusses the villain's story which revolves around his revenge but it was so weak comparing to how it was in the first film. I didn't feel his presence nor i felt his evilness. He was suppose to be much stronger here but i barely felt him. The film also brings back old characters that just all of a sudden showed up in some sequences to save the day and be the superhero of the act which felt so weird because they came out of nowhere.The film's CGI is okay at most times. It's defiantly not as good as the first one but it is for sure better than most of the MCU's latest projects this year like Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023). The cinematography unfortunately got downgraded which is something that I was anticipated for especially after seeing the first part. But I felt like there was no room for that because of how messy the sequences and story was especially that we were jumping between the past and present a lot and from one place to another.Not to mention, the whole last sequence of the film was so good in terms of the action sequences and grabbing the audience's attention. Really got me hooked and interested and wished if the rest was like that.","170 out of 224 found this helpful.

Unfortunately Aquaman 2 has to bear the burden of having to follow through the recent flops and/or mixed bag of superhero output from both MCU/DCEU.James Wan doesn't offer anything new under sky; a baddie who wants revenge - saw that in the Marvels. Sibling tension? Saw that in Thor. Supposedly all powerful, final-baddie who then gets thumped easily? Saw that in Black Adam. By now, there's such an air of familiarity in superhero fares, that I think it' gonna take a complete shift in narrative/plots to offer audiences a fresh take.Jason Momoa's charisma and screen presence is basically the backbone of the movie and it pretty much carries it through. His timing, especially humour, is spot on, while his Aquaman is also convincingly authoritative. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's somewhat wasted here. A capable actor, but he's reduced to portraying a stock baddie out for revenge, while his right arm, Stingray, is as one dimensional as they come. Plus it doesn't help that the actress who plays Stingray is kinda cardboard too.I find Randall Park, while dependable, nevertheless still plays Randall Park from other movies/Tv shows. You've seen his character in Blockbuster, or in the mcu outfits.Don't have any complaints on Amber Heard or Nicole Kidman, but they don't have enough screen time to make much of an impact. But I have to admit, I did wonder, what if Nicole played Capt. Marvel instead of Brie? I think I would have bought into it a lot faster. Kidman's talent is such that, even small screen time doesn't stop her from exuding enough screen presence to make her contribution count.Which leaves me with Patrick Wilson. His portrayal of Orm is brilliant, suffusing the character with the tension his inner conflicts have with his motives - ""do I live in hate, or do I forgive?"" The fact that Wilson achieves this without any acting histrionics but leaves his angst just right above the surface, just enough for us to feel it, is probably the standout feature of Aquaman and Lost Kingdom. I think he kinda redeemed himself from the poor and dumb Moonfall.I hope James Gunn will be able to create not only a new trajectory for DCEU, but an entire different take on superhero movies. While Aquaman 2 is entertaining enough to fill your 2h, it's also a by the numbers' effort. Not something you and I will live to remember.","101 out of 141 found this helpful.

The story is trite and predictable, the characters are flat the script is ugly, only the special effects are saved.The story is full of clich√©s and situations already seen in other movies, such as the final battle between good and evil, the reconciliation between brothers, and the sacrifice to save the world.The characters are uninteresting and shallowly developed. Aquaman is a generic hero, with no particular characteristics that distinguish him from others.The special effects are spectacular, but fail to save the film. The action scenes are well done, but the CGI is often obvious and unrealistic.In conclusion, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is an ugly movie as a script, which disappoints the expectations I had.","37 out of 56 found this helpful.

"3","/10","It felt like Aquaman had a day at Disneyland going into different kind of movie themed rides","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9505467/?ref_=tt_urv","iamianiman","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur58447224/?ref_=tt_urv","20 December 2023","Aquaman and The Lost of Kingdom suffers THE SAME problem with the first installment; it DOES NOT have a distinct identity. We were shocked to see that the major problem they had in Aquaman 1 was again manifested in this sequel. If you watch a film, you know the kind of tone and feel that a movie is giving you. But this movie feels like a jumbled medley of imitations from different kinds of films, almost like a parody. There's a 10-minute scene where you felt like this is from an Indiana Jones world, and then the next thing you know, you're stuck in the realm of Journey 2: The Mysterious Island. We can name a lot of different movies that this film takes its tone and design and pastes it into the movie. War of the Worlds, The Matrix Revolutions, Ridley Scott's Aliens and... okay, we'll stop now. The result is an endless patchwork of downgraded recreations from various movies. It felt like Aquaman had a day at Disneyland going into different kind of movie-themed rides (minus the 'fun').Adding to that, the first act felt like it was venturing into a documentary style format mixed with Ridley Scott's Alien style of exposition. Alien was a masterpiece but like we said, this is a dumpster reiteration, it was slow, it had little to no suspense, it tried to build momentum but it didn't work. They could have cut 10 minutes but they didn't. It was unnecessarily drawn out as they spent time showing the entirety of their journey into the deep unknown like this is some kind of art house film.Now, a lot are asking, is Amber Heard in it? Well, yes. Did she have many scenes? Her presence was only about 15% of the whole film. Her character, Mera did play a pivotal role for the story but James Wan, the director knew when to show her on screen. The question, 'Is her presence important on screen?' seems like what James Wan would ask himself before making the decision to put her in. She only had few dialogues but her performance was still flat.We also have a problem with how much they made use of 'space'. Especially in the first act, we saw they're a lot of wide shots used but the issue here is the space that filled in those shots; the surroundings, locations or/and environments were only there because... they were made to be there. It barely did anything to the story. But when it comes to scenes that were crowded or had various props or extras, the cameras ddin't give audience the time to breathe and process the visuals. A lot of mid to fast cuts, there wasn't much of a sense of appreciation to enjoy the visuals they have built. In the end, we felt discontented.First Aquaman at least had villains that were enjoyable to watch. This time, the villain or again, villains were just forgettable. The motivations were weak. The main villain didn't really drive the story forward. It had a backstory and conflict that were created merely for the purpose of this movie's existence. We couldn't care less because it's nowhere interesting, let alone enjoyable.And talking about that final battle... oh man. It was unbearable to the point that it turned laughable. Was it because of the reshoots that they suffered here? The whole movie, led to the final battle, it was a journey between Aquaman and his brother, only for us to find out that the villain was feeble and it gave the benefit of the plot armor for Aquaman and his weapon. It's just bad storytelling on top of bad execution overall.And the movie draggggggsssssss so much, we even questioned, 'What happened to James Wan?' From the beginning up until the climax, we were just waiting for something cool or unique to happen, but it didn't. It drags until the final battle where it should be longer but then that's when they decided to just cut things off and ended it abruptly the moment the exciting thing was about to pop up. We're confused.Amidst these flaws, one thing that truly stood out is its message on brotherhood. A beautiful message combo with good pairing, Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson have commendable chemistry, we can see it from the way they talk to each other. There's certainly some dedication they put into establishing their relationship. It's nothing that you can remember for years but it's enough to at least carry this movie despite the many bad outcomes this movie turned out to be.Ultimately, Aquaman 2 seems tailored for a younger audience who just want to enjoy monsters and sea creatures fighting against literally anything or anyone, rather than catering to teenagers or adults seeking a compelling narrative.Verdict: Similar to its predecessor, this sequel fails to find its identity, drowning in an ocean of borrowed tones and styles from previous movies. With a shallow story, forgettable villains and inconsistent pacing, this film struggles to stay afloat. While it's a tidal wave of disappointing results, the portrayal of brotherhood between the two leads stands out as a beacon, carrying the entire movie. Overall, this final chapter from the DCEU serves as a testament we're in dire need for a total reboot of these superheroes.","393 out of 506 found this helpful.

To my surprise, it wasn't that bad and I actually enjoyed this film. It wasn't without its problems, but I was pretty satisfied with it being what it was.The cons of this film are mainly dialogue and CGI. There are all of these cheesy lines that you would expect to hear and one line jokes at the end of a scene, almost like you are watching a sitcom series. Jason Mamoa as an actor has charisma and knows how to steal the show. But unlike the first Aquaman, here it feels as if he's just playing himself. There is no real depth to Arthur's (Jason Mamoa) arc, by the end he is still this punk cool guy which is fine but really nothing else.Here you have two villains. Black manta who was alright but ultimately fell short and then this monstrosity named Kordax who honestly looks like a power ranger villain, it's rough. The problem here for me is that this could've been an exciting hunt movie where Black Manta is just wreaking havoc on Arthurs life, without all of the supposed fleshing out of this universe.CGI here was just bad. Didn't look real or feel real. What's funny is that if you go back ten years or so, where the technology wasn't near what it is today, you have all these high- budget blockbuster films that are just beautiful. What happened?Now for what I did like. The biggest pro in my opinion is the Arthur and Orm dynamic. They have this wonderful chemistry and it turned out to have a heartwarming send off to Orm's character. I think Patrick Wilson is great as Orm. His character had a redemption arc which I just loved.The action here was also fun. There is a scene between Arthur and Black Manta where they are fighting with their tridents which was intense. Another sequence I had a really great time with was when Arthur breaks Orm out of prison. Quite a few jokes landed for me too.This film is a mess and yet has its moments. I finished the film thinking to myself ""Wow, don't judge a book by its cover"". Give this a shot, you might also enjoy this enough. It sums up to a brotherly fun adventure movie, without taking it too seriously.","34 out of 54 found this helpful.

Where the first film was hardly a masterpiece of the genre I thought it was over the top in all the right ways and because of that I actually mostly enjoyed it. This movie just doubles down on the insanity in all the worst ways and I ended up finding it borderline insufferable.For the first 15 minutes or so I thought I could enjoy it in a so bad it's good sort of way but it's too stupid to even enjoy in that way. The script just makes so many errors on the most basic level that if you think about any thing about this story for more than a minute it just collapses. Nothing that gets set up pays off in any meaningful way and most of the resolutions fell totally flat. It can't decide on a tone, it drags majorly and most of the humour made me cringe in all the worst ways.The performances really suffer as a result cause they're pretty poor across the board. I've liked Jason Momoa as this character but he's just too campy in this movie to take anything he's doing seriously, even actors of Yahya Abdul-Manteen II and Nicole Kidman's calibre deliver their lines in the flattest way possible but with the material they're given I can hardly blame that on them. I'm happy that Willem Dafoe was spared from this mess at least.The finale is the most bog standard CGI noise of a climax that we've seen so many times before that I was just totally bored watching it, at least the first film had some sense of spectacle to it. There's the odd fun action scene but the pretty dreadful visual effects just constantly took me out of it. The villain is terrible after a decent set up in the first film with the most generic motivations possible.The Lost Kingdom ends the DCEU with the biggest thud imaginable. It's been up and down since the beginning but it deserved a better conclusion than the soulless slog that this movie turned out to be. This might be the worst movie they ever made because at least Justice League had a happy conclusion with the Snyder Cut. There's nothing in this movie you haven't seen 100 times before and I've never been more ready for a total reboot of this universe.","230 out of 305 found this helpful.

Although the film suffers from being shallow and impractical sometimes and was lacking with the romance angle of it (understandable why Amber Heard couldn't be in the movie as much), I actually really liked seeing the characters and arcs of Black Manta and Orm. They had cool and good moments and were actually more interesting than Arthur/Aquaman himself! I don't see how anyone can really hate this.

Watching these two act like brothers in the movie was absolutely entertaining. It just worked so well.Aquaman 2 seemed to be about two brothers who don't know each other really well going on an Adventure to get to know each other and that worked.This movie seemed to be all about family and that helped with the personality of the blockbuster. Even Amber Heard which I was surprise how much of her actually made it to the final flick.Black Manta steps up as a great villain. His vengeance was well laid out.I will say the movie tried to be Epic without any substance.

NONE of that was the case however in this movie.To be avoided at all costs...","177 out of 254 found this helpful.

Now Jason and Patrick were fine as a pair but every single buddy one liner joke attempted ended as a big failure. I can give the benefit of the doubt and say ""writers' strike"" but I'm sure a lot of this was improv and I'm afraid it just didn't work. The idea was a good one just not well executed. I can't help but feel like there's no possibility of a sequel so not enough heart was put into this. The pacing was heavily affected by the obvious reshoots which for me was edited poorly. WB needed to man up and either just remove she who shall not be named or just fully include her. You can see she had a bigger role to play in all this and a lot of her content got cut. It really messed with the flow. The action we loved. The decision to have this possessed Black Manta who's able to go toe to toe with Aquaman made for a good story line and excellent fighting scenes. Story wise predictable and pretty boring. The one good thing for me was the redemption arc for Orm. We got to traverse a different side to his villainous past. I personally will miss this version of Arthur Curry. I'm not sure it can ever be matched. I was looking forward to exploring the numerous kingdoms we were introduced to but hey, over to you Mr Gunn. To be honest I wouldn't bother with any DCEU films at this point. The production teams can't be bothered so not sure why we should, well you should... I mean I'm gona watch them, so you don't have to... you're welcome.","46 out of 86 found this helpful.

The action is still really fun and well choreographed. That fun comic book flavor is still very much present. It's another adventure which I think is a genre that fits Aquaman well. The issue is the story is flat out bad. I don't know how this passed through a chain of command and everyone said yes. The script is even worse. Oh wow this a really bad script. There were moments I actually physically cringed at the dialogue. I don't know what Jason Momoa was doing in this film but it wasn't acting. Patrick Wilson was the biggest standout and I enjoyed him most on screen. He made Jason Momoas performance bearable. This is also coming from a Jason Momoa fan. This is without a doubt his worst performance. Amber Heard is barely in the film but oh wow she's really bad in this. I actually liked her in the first film but she's awful in this one. Overall a step down from Aquaman but I think that if you enjoyed the first one you'll enjoy this one. Just less so. A disappointing end to the DCEU no doubt.","31 out of 63 found this helpful.

The first Aquaman movie is absolutely ridiculous but I enjoyed it because it didn't take itself too seriously and understand what the movie was. I thought it had a fun energy and went bonkers in the best way. However, all the fun, energy and bonkers entertainment is just thrown out of the window with this sequel because this sequel is a gigantic mess.The narrative continues from the previous movie with new settings and concepts introduced and while I did like they introduced new settings that are pretty cool. Unfortunately, the writing feels really convoluted because the concepts and ideas were messy as if the writers didn't know how to put the concepts well-together. With all the reshoots and drama happening behind the scenes, I can't be surprised that the structure had fallen apart. Many of the special effects, production, make-up, and the colorful presentation are pretty rough and there are some noticeable poor CGI used but not like The Flash situation. The soundtrack is annoying and the action and thrills were just okay. Many of the cast members are doing their best but unfortunately, the performances weren't great and the dialogue was pretty bad. I honestly feel bad for Yahya Abdul-Mateen II cause he's talented and the character of Black Manta is pretty cool, but Mateen doesn't really get his chances to shine with his character.Director James Wan is talented as I enjoyed many of his works and I can see Wan is trying his best to create the sequel like the first one, but his direction was really bad as it feels sloppy and inconsistent. The sequel tries to follow the same non-serious 80s cheesy style, humor and tone from the previous movie but it doesn't work because the sequel kind of misses the point of what made the first one entertaining and ends up being pretty cringeworthy.I knew this movie wasn't going to be great and I just wanted to have dumb popcorn entertainment. Some dumb fun and laugh for the cheesiness but wow, it surprised me on how bad it was.One of the worst movies I have seen this year. Also from DC.","286 out of 422 found this helpful.

I love the first Aquaman when i first watch it in the theaters, and i recently watch it for the second time and unfortunately i have more criticism in my second watch and thought that it was just an ok superhero movie, Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom however, the sequel of the film was pretty good overall, still not without it flaws, but i felt more engaged in this one a bit more, mostly because we already know about Aquaman and now his new family, and what happen to his half-brother Orm, his new but also past villain Black Manta is back and i also felt more threat from him than Orm in the first movie, my only big major problem was the pacing of the movie, even though it shorter i feel like they should put more exciting and threatening scene and less of a slow scene that are important but they could make it shorter, i thought all the performances was fine, and the best thing of the film was simply the chemistry between Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson as their character in this movie, it's a pretty fun love hate relationship, exciting at times, and emotional too which is something that i don't really get that powerful in the first movie, i enjoy the first 30 minutes of the film then it's getting pretty slow in the middle with some things happen here and there, and then the last 45 minutes i started to getting into it again, while the last battle was not as amazing as the first one, it's still pretty great, not forget to mention about the visual and special effects both the first and in this one was always stunning, so overall Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom was flawed but still pretty good, i do like it better than the first one in a way, and having a pretty good superhero movie these days was getting rarer and rarer so i'm glad to actually getting an enjoyment from it.","74 out of 176 found this helpful.

It follows Aquaman as he faces a familiar foe to protect his Kingdom. It's certainly nothing groundbreaking or overly original within the superhero genre, but it's a solid plot nonetheless.Recycling a villain in only the second movie for this character could be seen as a little lazy. I'm no Aquaman super fan so I've no idea what his rogues gallery is like, but there was surely potential to have a bit more fun with this. In any case, the return of a familiar character removes the need for any excessive exposition and ensures the story moves along at a good pace.Speaking of characters, the cast list is pretty thin and there isn't much in the way of new blood in this film. You'd think this would give the script a chance to really develop these existing characters more, but that doesn't really happen. Perhaps another missed opportunity here.The action throughout is fine if nothing special. The effects are a mixed bag but are sometimes quite impressive. In addition, aside from some awkward humour that doesn't really work, the tone and feel of the film is quite good.Ultimately if you enjoy the superhero genre this film will give you a good time. It doesn't really push the boat out or take too many risks, but at the same time it feels like a superhero film from years gone by in that it is contained and simple in a refreshing way.","49 out of 112 found this helpful.

For whatever reason, the directors believed the best way to use Aquaman and all his powers was on land. In a desert. In the jungle. In caves. Seemingly anything to avoid the ocean. The best fight scenes were in the ocean. Shocking, I know! Even then, they barely utilize the full range of Aquaman's powers. It seemed like I was watching a weaker version of the Hulk who happened to be good at swimming.Next comes the ""villain"". His name is David. Very menacing, right? Oh no, here comes David! There is nothing remotely interesting about the character. He has a cliche motive to avenge his father by killing Aquaman. Never once did big scary David appear like a major threat. He is just there as something for Aquaman to fight and keep the runtime going.There is nothing that stands out from this movie to set Aquaman apart from any other superhero. It just exists. The settings are always generic and/or underutilized. The CGI is uninspired. The dialogue sounds like it came from an AI being asked to write the script. There never felt like there were any stakes. I have no reason, even if I was a huge Aquaman fan, to care for literally any of the characters. If a superhero film is going to fail in all of that, at least make the action scenes entertaining. It cannot even succeed in that.Just stay away from this film. It cannot pass even as mindless entertainment. I can only fathom that it was created as a no-effort cash grab by using the Aquaman name with a big-time actor.","53 out of 76 found this helpful.

This is however, a really good comic book movie that's a well-intentioned climate crisis metaphor and a buddy cop bromance across some pretty fun locations. Self contained and all the better for it, although it's final moment is a repeat of last time.Jason Momoa puts even more of himself in the character this time around. It's nice to see a character that's actually grown so much between films and the fact he's a parent struggling with a new-born baby stuck in a job he hates means Aquaman has probably never been more relatable.Patrick Wilson is so much better here, mainly because he's no longer burdened with being the villain and that means he can have so much more fun with it. He has a much stronger chemistry with Momoa than his previous scene partner and it's obvious Momoa really gets along with him as he really comes to life in those scenes.Unfortunately, the burden of being a villain in one of these now falls completely to Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and he's massively overqualified for what's given. The first film promised he'd be front and centre this time, which isn't entirely what happens. He's great early on but devolves into a mouthpiece for a proper DCEU villain by the end.James Wan's direction retains everything that stood out last time with a few Waners and one amazing horror moment and yet he's still frustratingly reigned in here rather than given increased creative freedom. Rupert Gregson-Williams's score is happy to just replay or remix all the themes from before and they're strong enough for that to work.Also, in a rare feat considering the current state of comic book cinema, the CG is better here than in the original. In a post Avatar world no underwater CG will ever be convincing. When on a 1:1 comparison with Aquaman though, the Lost Kingdom looks more believable helped massively by the lighting.","23 out of 53 found this helpful.

(DNA freeing Kordax and his Army instead of the Perfectly Fine Orichalcum Melting the Ice Caps and Freeing Them). Are the Writers taking Major Uppers whilst Writing these Scripts?2. üêú üî± Black Manta and Aquamans Hostile Relationship just wasn't Capitalised on properly through Dialogue. Aquaman Murdered his Father, and they barely have a lick of Dialogue with eachother?3. ‚ö´üî± Kordax being freed - I just Felt like they should of had a Great Final Battle with Kordax after Aquaman throws the First Black Trident at Him(you could still have that Stunning Slow Motion 2nd Trident Throw Kill)4. üëé The Second In Command Under Black Manta has to be one of the Worst Second In Commands in Cinema I've ever seen. She just shouts inaudible orders, has no personality whatsoever and just doesn't do a damn thing.Things I Liked about The Film -1. üìú The Storyline, I really liked the Storyline in this. It was Excellent in my opinion.......... until, again, introducing the, ""Oh Manta needs the Blood Now"" thing. ü§¶üèª2. üíêThe Visuals - So Many of the Visuals were so good to watch. That Atlantis Chase Scene was Visual Eye Candy üç¨ (others might not like this sort of thing).3. üé∂ The Score, I really liked the Score. Particularly the Atlantis Discovery Segment and the Black Manta Score.4. üëâüëà You Put Aquaman 2 Together with Aquaman 1 and It's a Good 1,2 Punch of a Storyline.5a. üé¨ The Action Scenes - I liked all of the Action Scenes. (except for one) I literally Tuned out during this Scene, it was the Orm and Aquaman Chase Scene in the Desert on these 8 legged Creatures. I tuned back in around the time that Orms Body got Covered by a Wave of Sea Water.5b. üî±üî±Still in The Action - That Aquaman Vs Black Manta Battle was so damn Good! The Camera Movements, the Zoom in/out, the Panning. It was Amazing. üëå5c. üë±üôãMore Action - The Orm vs Aquaman ""Push Scene"". I just really liked that Scene.5d. üî±üíÉ The Trident Throw Towards Mera. It was A Great Slow Motion Moment.5e. üî±üî±üíÄ The Final Kill - What a Final Kill!Overall, Ok, that was Fun, DCEU are You Done? Ok Good. Let's Bring on The DCU Now.","21 out of 50 found this helpful.

I did like the first Aquaman (2018) directed by James Wan and think it is one of the DC universe's better movies, so after watching the sequel Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom (2023) once again directed by James Wan, I thought the movie was a fun DC movie to watch like the first, but it still has its issues that can be a little distracting and the ending was awfully similar to another movie from another comic book cinematic universe.I still like Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry/Aquaman, and I like how despite not liking being king of Atlantis he still is trying to balance between being a husband and father to his wife Mera and his child and being king of Atlantis to protect everything; leading to him teaming up with his brother Orm/Ocean Master to go up against the villain Black Manta. I liked seeing Patrick Wilson return to play Orm/Ocean Master, and that Arthur Curry/Aquaman and him team up bonding as brothers throughout the movie; Arthur gets because he has info on the villain and what he is planning to do, but also that he can help with what Arthur Curry/Aquaman is trying to do when it comes to protecting Atlantis. Lastly, I all the controversy involving Amber Heard and trying to have her not return as Mera, but despite all the history she has had recently, she was not bad in the movie and Mera does help whenever she needs to come in; also, because she is Arthur Curry/Aquaman's wife she will help in some way.The villain Black Manta played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, who is not bad, and he is just getting revenge for the death of his father in the first movie, but also using the black trident to help his revenge plan against Aquaman; though he was cool to watch with the comic accurate outfit, he needed to do more when it came to him fighting Aquaman because he is mostly possesses by the black trident because of the trident's past, but he does have a few cool moments. The black trident's backstory was interesting but a little rushed when it came to the darker side and the fight between the two kingdoms with the evil king that lead one of the kingdoms against Atlantis; also, there are parts that are like what happens in the comics, but they are a bit rushed and they could have been executed better or could have had more time spent on them.The action sequences are fun to watch, though some of the CGI effects can look obvious, there are CGI effects that are not that bad, and there are backgrounds, despite being a green/blue screen, that can look visually pretty; also, everything underwater and the effects underwater looks particularly good. There are issues involving the movie being too silly, which there are funny moments and funny lines of dialogue, but it can be a weird back and forth when it goes from being funny to taking certain moments seriously, which those scenes can be effective; there are also some issues involving bits of the plot and the ending could have been a bit better, but it was ok, even though it was similar to how another comic book movie ended from another cinematic universe.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

It's like a cheap parody of the original, except that it's actually the original. The acting is so wooden and emotionless it's on par with what you would see with a cheap porno flick. The CGI is absolutely horrendous that it's actually comical at times. The plot is razor thin, you have to force yourself to pay attention, but if you zoned out for 10 minutes you likely missed nothing important. Most of the dialog between characters is on a elementary school level. Robotic sharks? LOL. The list goes on. This would make my bottom 3 easily in the superhero genre all-time. It's just dreadful and a mess.","20 out of 26 found this helpful.

Tremendous action scenes with outstanding visuals and score make this an absolute winner. But at the heart of the movie is the relationship with the two brothers which comes to a head in the final battle. Beautiful and emotional ending and a humorous mid credit scene add to the proceedings. I've never been a big fan of Momoa but he acquits himself well here again unlike the silly character he played in the last awful Fast movie. Wilson and yes Heard were also equally good. After a somewhat ponderous first quarter the movie becomes pure fun for those who still have the ability to enjoy movies. My wife who had no desire to see the movie ended up enjoying it as much as I did. Ignore the haters of everything and go see a spectacular movie.","53 out of 132 found this helpful.

That being said, similar to the original, it's hard to really *hate* this movie. James Wan does a lot of things very, very well and I appreciate that unlike Marvel (although, I suspect this will change), his stamp is all over this movie.There's one sequence where Aquaman (Jason Momoa) and his Loki-esque brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) are fighting in an undersea laboratory that reminded me a lot of 12 Monkeys. Moments like that make Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom worth watching. Wan and cinematographer Don Burgess have the camera whizzing and wirring all over the place in a style reminiscent of video games, and it works. For the most part.This movie, like the last one, is at its best when its weird. There's a confidence to the movie that I really enjoyed; a film where Nicole Kidman acts alongside a giant crab man, where people's homes are made of reefs and skyscrapers are giant jellyfish. Where ancient zombie people left behind after the Sahara dried up and became a desert house undersea prisoners. When this movie is at its weirdest, it's a lot of fun.Wan also knows how to keep it light and give us a feel good adventure movie, and I can't deny that Momoa and Wilson have excellent chemistry. I do acknowledge though...a lot of this was trodden by Thor and Loki from the MCU. It's very similar to the point of ripping it off.Unfortunately, the problems don't end there. From Amber Heard (conspicuously and hilariously absent through most of this film, although I have to admit, she rocks that Meera outfit VERY well) to Dolph Lundgren (who's doing his best but comes off as a frat guy attempting a Swedish accent) to Yahya Abdul Mateen (who lacks the menace factor to truly make Black Manta work), the acting in this movie is underwelming.Even Momoa, the heart and soul of this franchise, comes off a bit too dumb and goofy. They decided to go full Thor: Love and Thunder with him, and aspects of this movie actually make it feel like they didn't really care about the preceding events of other films. (For example, why does the movie rip off the classic ending from Iron Man again? In universe, EVERYONE knows who Aquaman is). I wouldn't say he's as bad at the last depiction of Thor, but he's not far off.The CG is also quite choppy at times; sometimes looking fantastic and at other moments looking absolutely terrible. Anytime the characters are CG and doing something (specifically, I'm thinking of a part with Meera in this big underwater action scene in the middle), they look BARELY any better than Spiderman in 2002. It's mind blowing considering the budget and I'm probably a bit biased, JUST having seen Dune.Overall, this is a fun movie that's worth watching, even if it feels like somewhat of a let down considering the original and what it represents, as the final DCEU movie. While I overall like Jason Momoa as Aquaman, I feel like he existed in an overarching franchise that didn't have enough direction to really do him right.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The action and vfx are pretty on point, while very jarring, I think it fits the already ridiculous setting and plot.Aquaman 2 knows exactly what it is, but it doesn't try to do anything to improve upon the first film. The writers especially didn't improve anything. Multiple times I was scratching my head at stupid inconsistencies within the script.

-It's a movie that feels a bit like the comic books I read during the golden era of books, fun, heroic, and good vs. Evil.-The movie focuses on trying to bridge the gap between Aquaman movies, focusing on its own story rather than a connected universe that Disney has focused on. And that works to not have the pressure on some divine interconnected plot.-You'll get plenty of those moments that feel like a cinematic comic book, perfect for some mindless enjoyment and fun that has been lost in the big game of finance.-And it's pretty easy to follow for the most part as it's a fine movie to jump into, as they have done well to catch you up and get into the new adventure.The Humor Is Fun
-Leave it to Wan to make a movie that knows how to be action oriented, but still fun and lighthearted to cut through the dark.-Aquaman 2 has plenty to offer in comedy, primarily in the delivery and jovial ribbing between the brothers as they fight against the odds across the lands. They really feel like sibling rivalry, a partnership that has great chemistry and natural feel.-A CGI octopus with a character of its own helps add some fun, alongside plenty of other characters tossing their hat into the ring with jokes and mannerisms that are simple, but work.-I myself enjoyed a lot of the lines from a crabby character, who just knew how to put the right twists on his voice to make things very comedic in the endgame. Again using past actions and those relationships from the first film.-It's not done too much for me, only a few times getting a tad too silly, as they kept everything in good spirit to balance out the ""darker"" undertones of the movie.The World Building/Design
-Wan's investment in the Warner Bros technology was solid again for me, a credit to making things really pop out in that comic book feel, but with the real life touch.-The new worlds have character like a still, but with colors and contrast that help add more elements than 2-D animation can sometimes do.-There is organic feeling in the new designs to Atlantis, blending lights and animals that add that unique touch compared to some other worlds in other comic flicks, very fitting for the fabled kingdom.-While the more scientific and darker elements hold very engaging designs, with a sense of menacing malice and cold touch that mimics the deadly aura they were going for.-The point is that Wan does a nice job making the visuals pop, flow, and have some rather impressive animation that doesn't dip too much, despite some of the faker elements.Loved Some Of The Character Development
-The first movie did this somewhat, but to have to introduce so much in so little time, it felt half complete.-This movie helps extend more on the characters really expanding past the sheen of the problem and working towards making Arthur more than just the man in gold and green.-Add in more of the development for his brother, trying to expand on his own merits from the last movie and continuing on to help continue to push them for future movies.-Even some other characters get a little more layering and that helped improve their inclusion into this film.A Few Of The Action Scenes
-Some of the action scenes in the second installment show that comic book movies can still pack a punch if given the right care and focus.-An early scene in the beginning had some cool moves that felt like a good Star Wars chase scene, but with that DC animated universe mashup.-Another one used a bit more of the anime level antics, adding that flair and sheen with a tad of that Snyder flair in terms of design and execution.-But one scene near the end was ecstatic with an awesome exchange and choreography that had attitude, drama, effects, and that intensity that I had been waiting to see.-These were the pieces that made this movie shine for me and give me hope something else could be possible in the new direction.DISLIKES:The Story Needs Work
-Yet, the story does need work. Primarily in terms of completeness and time to develop.-The second dive into the underwater realm is very predictable, much of it due to the trailers' revelation and a pretty simple storyboard for this movie
-It's clich√© at times, using very familiar elements, and many of the moments are very short lived before moving on to the next.-It's not that you don't have enough to get the full tale, it's just, kind of forgettable, with only a few elements standing out in the rough of the mediocre elements of the movie.-More connections to the characters, more edge, more surprise? Something needed to have a little more completeness for this reviewer.The Action Scenes Mostly Too Short
-I said earlier that the action feels just right with those memorable moments that will end up on YouTube.-Yet, most of these sequences don't last that long. I timed several and most of the ""action"" moments uninterrupted lasted fewer than five minutes, my favorite fight was shorter than two.-As such, the result was wishing that there were a few moments of having these moments last longer, more stakes and fewer jumps that could have really amplified this moments up. Sort of like Star Wars used to do.The Climate Change Angle
-I never thought that I would see such a heavy hit on environmental change in a movie about superheroes.-Aquaman 2 makes a very valid point and shows the dangers of the Global Warming discussion that fills much of the news and web.-Still, the movie takes it a tad too far, going to the point of going out of its way to remind us about it, as if Greta Thunberg was writing it.-I totally get it, but the movie kind of got a little carried away with it, and the public service announcement felt a little too ingrained that made the story too cheesy and eye rolling at times.Character Balance Is Mixed
-The movie has a lot of characters in it, and I can't say that all of them were in good balance compared to the first movie.-There are a variety of reasons why this was the case, but the movie did a lot of juggling with people and sort of passing the baton a little too rapidly for my tastes
-You'd get used to a character being in the show and then somehow we jump around trying to establish the stakes, only to come back and characters had moved on.-A shame as there are some really fascinating characters, but alas, the classic modern trend to cram and cram some more still is holding straight and true.Pacing Is A Tad Too Fast
-Though fun and entertaining, the movie is moving a bit too fast to handle all the things it was trying to do.-The result is that such a breakneck pace led to a lot of things being shaven to the bare minimum, all with rapid editing to fit it all in.-It's not so fast that I felt I missed too many things, but more so that that movie just feels an edited down version of the major tale they wanted to craft.Too Much In One Movie?-I believe the answer for me is yes.-The Lost Kingdom wants to do a lot, something maybe three hours could have accomplished in the perfect amount of details.-But at just over two, battles and antagonism development, stakes, and world exploration feel very limited despite how much Wan tries to make it grand.-It's not bad by any means for me, but just feeling very bland and perhaps could have left several aspects out for a third movie (if they would pursue one).The VERDICT:Aquaman's second adventure was very fun with enough splendor to make the movie worth a trip to the theater. Wan's got the elements for a 3-D showing, maybe not as good as Cameron's Avatar look wise, but still worth an investment in my eyes. It's got a lot of entertainment value. It's fun, funny, moves quickly, but has a story that is simple, contained, and telling of a comic book story arc. True, it needs some work, finding a better blend of activism with adventure story, alongside helping to use the characters a bit more, but not the worst story I have seen. Sadly, for me, the movie's main element that fails is too much stuff in one movie, and too little time to do it. This resulted in very quick moments, missing that depth, heft, build up and that prime execution that other films have achieved better. Thus, the movie still feels better than many other DC and even Marvel movies, but there was more I felt in this movie that might have been left to the cutting room floor. My scores after review are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 7.0-7.5
Movie Overall: 7.0.","16 out of 45 found this helpful.

Even from my old Cartoon Network Justice League days, Aquaman has just never really impressed me enough to care. But when Jason Momoa was chosen to play the character, I did look forward to an Aquaman that I might like. We're now 3 movies deep, and I still find myself unable to like the character in any capacity. A unimpressive ability, an uninteresting backstory and that god-awful goldfish looking costume just doesn't cut it for me.Given all that, I can still admit that the first Aquaman movie was at least somewhat entertaining. I wasn't the biggest fan of it though, as by that time, I had already grown tired of the superhero genre, but objectively still, I could see people enjoying it. Aquaman 2 however, is by all standards an uninspired, uncharismatic bore with little to no redeeming qualities about it. It's a mess all around, with all those heavy reshoots clearly taking a toll on the movie's outcome. The disjointed storyline coupled with some horribly generic writing doesn't do it any favors either.It's entirely forgettable and is a waste of your time should you want to go check it out. But if you're still adamant about wanting to watch it, I can only hope that you're strong enough to not doze off during the movie.","80 out of 127 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is a good ""buddy cop"" film with Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson entertaining us, an adventure for whole family - My Ultimate Review","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9507532/?ref_=tt_urv","Holt344","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur80693802/?ref_=tt_urv","21 December 2023","Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is a direct sequel to the 2018 film with a lot of actors returning to play their roles, except for Willem Dafoe as Vulko, he's missed in the film but Nicole Kidman's bigger role as Atlanna is much appreciated. James Wan is back directing and producing, also co-writing the story with the help of Jason Momoa along with Thomas Pa'a Sibbett and David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick, the latter of them having written the screenplay for both films now. James Wan is also working with Rupert Gregson-Williams who did the score for the previous film, but also cinematographer Don Burgess. The cinematography was spectacular in the previous film, a reason along with Wan's vision and the top notch visual effects used. This is a film I've looked forward to for many years now, right after hearing the word of a sequel, so how did it hold up if you compare it to Aquaman (2018). Decent actually but not what it could have been. Aquaman was a superhero film I look back on fondly, staying true to its source material and just being entertaining. The underwater sequences looks great and the action is great underneath the water, I really liked the visual effects, but at times the characters looked too CGI. The people who work with the visual effects are overworking themselves, but they succeeded with this film I think, the extra time and money was needed. I think the film would have been better if it would have kept one tone and not go back and forth between a slightly darker tone and lighter tone. The film also suffered from pacing issues with important parts of the story happening off screen, making you question what's happening, yet it's entertaining from start to finish. It should have been longer.Aquaman balances his duties as king and as a member of the Justice League, all while planning a wedding. Black Manta is on the hunt for Atlantean tech to help rebuild his armor. Orm plots to escape his Atlantean prison.I think it was a great story and it was the right choice to make the film into a ""buddy cop"" movie with Arthur and Orm, having these brothers, these enemies, bond throughout the movie felt just right. Momoa and Wilson had some great chemistry together, selling the buddy cop brilliantly. The focus is almost entirely on them, leaving the other characters with not much to do, then again you could ask yourself if it needed to be a large ensemble. I believe this worked for the best. Having them work together to beat Black Manta, the rightful villain of the movie, it just shows that Arthur and Orm is more similar than they thought they were.A part of me were disappointed with the lack of scenes with Mera, a great character in the comics, but she got a couple of great action sequences. The film is about family and she has a part to play in the theme with being the wife to Arthur and the mother to Junior, not much else and almost no dialogue. Is it because of the controversy regarding her? Most likely, for good reason. The character ""Mera"" should have been recast. Back to the duo, Orm gets a redemption arc and was given the best writing of the characters. Patrick Wilson plays him brilliantly, both dramatically and the more action heavy sequences, he succeeds in both. Although I really liked the passion Jason Momoa has for the role, I just feel he's a bit dumbed down and trying to be too funny. Similar to Thor in the two new films. I like Jason Momoa though, he has made this character his own. The story about Black Manta wanting revenge and seeking out the Lost Kingdom which is worth not reading about, I went in not knowing as much (because of me not reading anything it's based on or just reading wiki) and it was the best I could have done, the mystery is quite fascinating and when they get deeper and deeper into the Lost Kingdom, the better the film gets. I would say the first half was kind of mixed for me, then during the second half, I absolutely loved the film and found myself entertained and fully immersed. It's when everything is coming full circle, Black Manta holds his own against the two Atlantians and is in the focus of most of the action sequences I could say is good. Choreography, effects and acting. They were great, meanwhile all the filler scenes was action for no reason other than having action. Black Manta along with Orm, had the best character arcs in the film, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II were once again terrific. What about the comedy in the film, there's much more of it in this film and whilst I feel the tone is like the later Thor films, I think it works for the most time but I didn't laugh as much as they wanted me to. The jokes were often badly written, which I can give a pass because of the dialogue between the characters was mostly good. The Brine King is once again a surprising highlight, this time being both bad ass and the comedic relief which worked every time.The film stars Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry / Aquaman alongside Patrick Wilson as Orm Marius, Amber Heard as Mera, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as David Kane / Black Manta, Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, Dolph Lundgren as Nereus, Randall Park as Dr. Stephen Shin and Temuera Morrison as Tom Curry. I went into the acting a bit before, Patrick Wilson and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is the highlights here, giving their A game with strong performances, selling everything. Jason Momoa is just a delight, but he could have given a better execution on the dramatic side, the question is if James Wan directed him that way. This is an Aquaman who feels comfortable in his shoes, being both from land and sea. That says a lot about his character and Jason Momoa does a great job capturing that. Randall Park gave an underrated performance which is worthy to praise.The sound editing and mixing was quite great, the same quality I believe as the previous film. The musical score was fantastic. Watching another Aquaman film at the cinema, the big screen and surround sound, it's just an unforgettable experience. There are things to criticize as Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is far from a perfect movie, yet, does it need to be this perfect and flawless film? Not really, it has a grand scale and builds on the world and characters from the previous film, thus giving us an entertaining adventure with plenty of action sequences you'll like. James Wan is a great director and he shows it once again here, even making fun of something which bothered me in the previous film, the constant interruption explosions. Most of the times, he does let the characters just interact which is needed for the brothers' arcs. I hope James Wan gets to direct something else at DC, he's talented and has shown it in two completely different genres now. If you did enjoy the previous film, I'm sure you're going to like Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom, it doesn't have as great of a story but still worth to invest your time in. Jason Momoa will forever be my Aquaman.","21 out of 65 found this helpful.

Jason Momoa returns as the charismatic and heroic Arthur Curry, who must team up with his estranged brother Orm (Patrick Wilson) to stop the vengeful Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) from unleashing a powerful weapon that could destroy the surface world. The film is directed by James Wan, who brings his signature style of thrilling set pieces, inventive visuals, and humorous banter to the superhero genre. The film also features Amber Heard as Mera, Nicole Kidman as Atlanna, Randall Park as Dr. Shin, and Martin Short as Kingfish, a new character who provides some comic relief.The film's strengths lie in its exploration of the rich mythology and history of Atlantis, as well as the dynamic relationship between Arthur and Orm, who have to overcome their past grievances and learn to trust each other. The film also delivers some spectacular action scenes, such as a chase through a sunken city, a battle with a giant sea monster, and a climactic showdown with Black Manta and his army of mercenaries. The film's weaknesses are its predictable plot, its over-reliance on CGI, and its lack of emotional depth. The film does not offer much character development or emotional stakes for the protagonists, and the villain's motivation is rather simplistic and clich√©d.Overall, Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom is a highly entertaining and visually stunning film that will appeal to fans of the first film and the DC Extended Universe. It is not a groundbreaking or profound film, but it is a fun and satisfying popcorn flick that delivers what it promises. I give it seven stars out of ten.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

While the film showcases impressive visual moments (some CGI well-executed and others not so much) and thrilling action sequences, it fails to replicate the freshness, beauty, and coherence of its predecessor.Comedic scenes, such as the inclusion of the cockroach, are perplexing and feel out of place in a story aiming to balance epic action with humorous elements. This attempt to lighten the plot sometimes results in an uneven tone and a less impactful effect than in the first installment.I perceive the film as an inferior sequel, struggling to stay afloat amid the numerous challenges director James Wan faced during its production: the changes requested by Warner Bros, James Gunn's sabotage, the Amber Heard issue, and reshoots, all contributing to a sense of disorder in the final execution.While Wan did his best given the circumstances, there comes a point where it seems like the film gives in to the difficulties, reflected in certain aspects of the narrative that could have benefited from more cohesion and development or scenes that could have been explored more.Undoubtedly, Wan's biggest mistake might have been the choice of the writer: David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick. The plot, although filled with exciting elements and mythology, lacks a solid narrative, poorly crafted storyline, and at times, ridiculous dialogues. Johnson appears to rely too much on formulas from other well-known films instead of offering a truly original story, and that is the film's major flaw.In general: This film dives into turbulent waters, facing internal and external challenges that affect its overall quality. While it has some moments of success, the movie fails to reach the narrative depths of its predecessor, ending up as a merely passable conclusion for Aquaman and the DCEU.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Forget showcasing Aquaman's raw power; we're stuck with a neglectful father, husband, and king who happens to be proficient at water aerobics. The movie spends more time on side attractions like cinematography, visuals, and subordinates, forgetting that Aquaman should be the main event. With attempts at humor falling flatter than a sunken ship, it's clear they lost the recipe that made the first Aquaman somewhat tolerable. And seriously, a DCEU finale without a Justice League cameo? It's like they're drowning in missed opportunities. I'll generously give it a two out of five-mainly for the underwater scenery.","62 out of 100 found this helpful.

Especially not compared to a lot of other superhero movies out there, both DC and Marvel offerings. This one is, like it's predecessor, a visual feast and there is lots of action - and I do mean LOTS - some attempts at comedy that didn't necessarily hit the mark, not much Amber Heard, not enough Nicole Kidman and Temeura Morrison (I love the Australian and New Zealand representation!) and a barely-coherent plot that, I assume, was included to space out the action sequences.The hulking Jason Momoa as Arthur Curry aka Aquaman is a commanding on-screen presence no matter the scene or setting. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as Black Manta was good, if a little stereotypical. Patrick Wilson's Orm gets a chance at redemption.

So I guess they succeeded in that aspect. It wasn't a script that requires a lot of audience participation, as it was essentially just a visually nice popcorn movie; just lean back and enjoy the action on the screen.The final showdown was really anti-climatic and rushed, and that certainly stole away from the overall enjoyment of the movie.There was several scenes with comic relief throughout the course of the movie, some better than others. Of course it is a matter of personal preference, whether you like such or not, but I found some of the scenes to be infantile.And there is a lot of action and fighting throughout the course of the 124 minutes that the movie ran for. It kept the movie enjoyable in my opinion.""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom"" does have a good cast ensemble, and it was nice to see actors and actresses from the 2018 ""Aquaman"" movie return to reprise their characters for this 2023 sequel.The special effects in the movie were good, and that definitely made the movie all the more enjoyable to sit through. And the wardrobe, costume and prop departments really worked their magic quite well. Cyberpunk sharks and octopi, this movie has it all. I never thought the day would come when I would see such things, but here it is.All in all, a movie that I am sure fans of the superhero genre will enjoy. But for a casual viewer it was an okay movie to watch, but nothing outstanding or particularly memorable.My rating of ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom"" lands on a six out of ten stars.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

The underwater effects ranged from very good to a jumbled mess at times, but there were some entertaining action moments and at least it was different from the usual CGI punchfests on land.I would rank this ahead of some of the more recent MCU films like The Marvels which was beyond terrible, and Quantumania which just didn't do it for me.

Every other line was very awkward and silly. This was especially the case with actress Jani Zhao and Jason Mamoa. Jason Mamoa felt like he was playing his character from Fast X. His character was too silly and inconsistent with how he played the role in the first film. The humor was downright atrocious and forced. The way Aquaman was portrayed was reminiscent of how Thor was portrayed in Love and Thunder. Randall Park also felt out of place throughout this whole film. Amber Heard was also in the film reprising her role. She was honestly okay in the film.The film focuses too much on the relationship with Aquaman and Orm which once again is cheesy and cliche. Black Manta returns and is probably the best played character. However his character is used to build up something else that ultimately fails to satisfy in the end.The fight scenes and action were not as good as in the first film and the characters are just not as interesting. The world of Atlantis didn't have the same lore as it did in the first film and the ending is very weak.","69 out of 119 found this helpful.

The truth is that it is not bad at all. I actually enjoyed it a fair amount. I feel this movie suffered from increased expectations, being the last of the DC movies, when it is the much-needed conclusion. But Momoa is as charismatic as ever, Patrick Wilson makes for a great straight man, and there are brawls aplenty. It manages to wring plenty of fun out of old tropes, with a redemption arc and a message of eco-awareness. Yes, its morality and sanctimony are basic, but that IS the current state of the 'comic book' movie, with commercialism long ago having taken precedent over passion projects and auteurship. It's a solid 'aloha' to the franchise and signs off more successfully than any previous DC movie.Plus, an octopus rides a seahorse.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

It's four years later and even though numerous atrocities continue above water, Arthur Curry has become a domesticated husband and father, and oh yeah he finally has a job: king of Atlantis--a position that's not all it's cracked up to be as his mostly surface-dwelling sensibilities clash with the traditional ways of the Atlantean council. Meanwhile in other, unsurprising news: David Kane now Black Manta will stop at nothing to destroy the half-breed honcho and his aquatic domain, forcing Arthur to team up with long-imprisoned little brother Orm, their relationship which is the equivalent of oil and water. Momoa is his usual, unflappable self and while some of the petty bickering between him and debased Wilson produces a few chuckles, the rest of the returning characters are wasted, any new characters are superfluous, visual effects are second-rate, and the story never does anything exciting or memorable. Scuttlebutt is that this was a post-production nightmare due to all of the extensive cuts and reshoots, making it curious what was originally intended, but all we get here is a trivial, two-hour excursion. They say everybody is good at something, just too bad the producers weren't good at making a worthwhile sequel. **","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

However, unlike many previous DCEU films which took themselves too seriously, Aquaman 2 has none of the melancholy of a changing of the guard. Instead, it doubles down on being louder, brighter and more fun - a sincere comedy buddy film directed by James Wan following Hollywood sequel formulas aiming to do what previous DCEU films failed at - being purely entertaining.Many years have passed in Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. Arthur Curry is now husband and father to a new baby. But as King of Atlantis, he bears greater responsibilities. Meanwhile, his arch-nemesis David Kane, still hellbent on avenging his father's death at Arthur's hands, has unexpectedly discovered the legendary Lost Kingdom of Atlantis and gained access to ancient Atlantean super-technology like a mystical black trident. Now far more powerful, Kane pushes Arthur to his limits, forcing him to seek help from another former ruler - Orm, Arthur's banished half-brother, who may be willing to aid the Aquaman once more.As the final DCEU film, Aquaman 2 doesn't need to lay groundwork for future films or introduce other DC characters. This purity of focus keeps the story centered around Arthur and his family - wife Mera (Amber Heard returns), father Tom Curry, Atlantis' queen and Orm. Only a new baby is added to the clan, not making Arthur a struggling new dad but further cementing his lovable buffoonish image.Audiences love Jason Momoa's charmingly dopey Aquaman and this sequel delivers more of that. Arthur is even goofier, kinder and joke-loving here. Though a global crisis emerges, it's hard to see heaviness weighing Arthur down as he happily tackles dangers, experiencing brief sadness only when loved ones are hurt before continuing to unworriedly pummel baddies with no ulterior motives. ""With great power comes great responsibility"" doesn't apply to Aquaman - he acts on instinct without overthinking. This makes Aquaman 2 one of the most joyous superhero films in recent memory, choosing fun and silliness over depth.Wan amps up everything - effects, stunts and action are grander, wilder and more stimulating. What began as elaborate single-take shots in the first film evolves into even more complex choreography. Fights pit Aquaman against giant robots, high seas vehicle chases and zombie hordes. Black Manta becomes a far greater threat, sometimes besting Aquaman in battle.In a move akin to manga where yesterday's villain becomes today's friend, Orm transforms from the dour foe of the first film into an endearing partner, his strict nature loosening under Aquaman's irreverent influence. With Patrick Wilson a close friend, Wan has seemingly washed away Orm's prequel sourness.Ultimately, the best way to view Aquaman 2 is with no expectations. Forgetting DCEU disappointments and departures allows the film's intended entertainment to shine through unfettered. It's a buddy comedy that embraces silliness over grit, a radical tonal shift for the typically serious DCEU. For a purely fun and spectacular two-hour experience, Aquaman 2 delivers on its sole responsibility. Whether audiences embrace this approach remains to be seen in this new politically correct era where judgment stems as much from extended universe perception as singular works. But for those just wanting thrilling escapism, it succeeds as a hearty comic book romp.","9 out of 33 found this helpful.

Ok, three, maybe more if I think hard enough about it and squeeze all the dopamine out of my neurons for this task.I did not have big expectations for it, as personally I don't really enjoy superhero movies as it's all just explosions, effects and raunchy punchlines but OH MY GOD this one had NONE OF THAT.There is NOT A SINGLE funny line or some comic relief that could at least give you the impression that hey, at least I chuckled two pennys worth.The acting? Ok for this piece of modern film making, would be hard to mess this one up with the toys they've been given to play around in the sandbox....The only moment where I've actually felt interested in what's going on was in the beginning, and you will know it when you see it. My heart was full of hope in those minutes until Warner Brothers disappointed all of us yet again with their decision making involving a certain domestic violence perpetrator.All in all?

People nowadays are so overly critical and judgmental about everything. They tend to nitpick so they can complain about something. Even though the plot and story line was predictable, but this second movie of Aquaman is still intriguing. I like how they made Arthur and Orm forgive each other. The two brothers are now at peace. How can you be salty about something good?! Even though there's a certain actress whom everybody hates right now.

The story is nearly as strong as the first and expands into more territory with much more variety and world building. Wan's keen eye for detail is unmatched.

Yet, beneath the surface, the film reveals itself to be tethered to familiar narrative anchors, wheeling out old tropes that border on the contemptible.One of the most glaring missteps of ""The Lost Kingdom"" is its treatment of antagonists. The film seems waterlogged with adversaries who lack the depth and complexity needed to elevate the overarching narrative. In contrast to its predecessor's visually stunning underwater landscapes, this sequel disappointingly fails to make waves with its visuals, leaving audiences with a sense of underwhelm.The original Aquaman film managed to strike a delicate balance, marrying seriousness with elements of fantasy seamlessly. However, ""The Lost Kingdom"" takes a daring detour into cartoonish territory, marking a departure from the established tone. This shift in approach may prove divisive, alienating those who were drawn to the first film's ability to blend epic fantasy elements with a grounded narrative.As the sequel relentlessly pursues spectacle, it becomes apparent that the quest for visual grandiosity takes precedence over a compelling and innovative storyline. The financial imperative to outdo its predecessor in terms of visual extravagance appears to compromise the significance of delivering a fresh and engaging narrative. In this pursuit of grandeur, ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom"" loses sight of the elements that made the first film a success - a captivating story set against the backdrop of a visually stunning underwater world.Struggling to stay afloat in a sea of expectations, this sequel seems to grapple with the challenge of recapturing the magic that distinguished Aquaman in the superhero genre. As it navigates through familiar waters, ""The Lost Kingdom"" finds itself at odds with its own ambitions, leaving audiences with a sinking feeling that the sequel falls short of the cinematic depths explored by its predecessor.","Thank you!

Surprisingly, my second experience with the movie turned out to be much more enjoyable, and I discovered aspects that I had overlooked during my first encounter.At first glance, ""Aquaman"" didn't capture my attention entirely, and I even found myself dozing off during my initial viewing. However, giving it a second chance proved to be a wise decision. The film has its moments, and while it might not be a cinematic masterpiece, it certainly has its charms.One aspect that stood out to me on this revisit was the remarkable fight scenes. The choreography and execution of the action sequences were truly impressive. The underwater battles were visually stunning, and the film's use of special effects in these moments was undeniably captivating. These scenes breathed life into the narrative and showcased the superhero's prowess in a way that kept me engaged.On the flip side, the CGI in some parts of the film left something to be desired. There were moments where the digital effects felt a bit overdone and took away from the overall immersion. However, it's important to note that such critiques are often subjective, and the CGI, while not flawless, does contribute to the fantastical world of Aquaman.Despite its imperfections, ""Aquaman"" redeems itself as a family-friendly movie. The film's themes of loyalty, self-discovery, and the importance of family make it a heartwarming choice for a movie night with loved ones. The dynamic between the characters, especially within the royal family of Atlantis, adds a layer of relatability that resonates with audiences of all ages.In conclusion, ""Aquaman"" may not have initially won me over, but a second viewing revealed its hidden gems. The incredible fight scenes and family-friendly themes make it a solid choice for an entertaining movie night. While some CGI aspects may not meet everyone's expectations, the overall experience is worth diving into, especially if you're looking for a film to enjoy with your family.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

But not nearly as bad as some people claim it to be.Plot holes? Sure. Issues with pacing? Yup. Way too dumb jokes from time to time? Duh. And yet - watchable. You can enjoy it, if Poop-the-bed Princes and Environments Messages do not bother you. If they do,,, well, tough luck.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Yes the special effects were impressive and there were a few funny jokes but other than that the story was dull and confusing. They did try to help by having a narrator poke in every once and awhile but flow of the movie was rather disjointed. Several times I looked down on my phone to see the how much long I hand before this mess of a film was over. Look I like Jason but even Arnold is a better actor. Again while the special effects were good there was too much of it. OK this movie is turning over to be a flop just as the recent Ant Man flopped. Both I believe suffered from too much CGI. I feel that the reason that people are fatigued over these Super Hero movies that there's nothing new. Many parts of the script seems like a rip-off of Star Wars movie. Just a final thought, I had heard that Amber Heard was basically taken out of the movie but she is seen throughout the film.","19 out of 29 found this helpful.

Even though the fight scenes didn't quite have the emotional impact of the first Aquaman, there was a lot more action that was fun to watch. My 2 criticisms are that the climax should have been better (just too short and abrupt) and Amber Heard's Mera got only a fraction of her previous screen time, helping out here and there but not very impactful to me as an audience. But my favorite part of Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom was essentially every time Orm and Arthur were together. It obviously wasn't a comedy movie but the two shared funny moments together.The whole point of movies is entertainment. You should find reasons to enjoy a movie instead of being critical about plot and story to make it less entertaining. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is a fun movie to watch that I enjoyed very much, so hopefully more people can take off their critical lenses and enjoy an action packed journey.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

It really depends what your taste is and what you're looking for in a movie. Sure, you could say that about literally any movie, but for a movie like Citizen Kane, someone could say ""it's really good, just not for me"" and that's about the closest you can get to it being ""bad"". Aquaman and Aquaman 2 are not traditionally good movies. They're full of cliches, corny dialog, messy pacing, and decently unfocused in themes. But man is it fun. The jokes can be utterly ridiculous yet somehow still hilarious, the action set pieces and in world locations are awesome, the world building is interesting and fun, Arthur is an absurd yet great protagonist, and the movie simply has a ton of heart. It knows what it is, and it leans into it. If that's not for you, I get it. It's dumb and schlocky and ridiculous. But if you enjoy movies like Moonfall or Fast & Furious then this is 100% for you. If you can get past what the movie isn't and accept what it's trying to be, strap in and enjoy the ride. If not, there's no shame in skipping it. A very fun and enjoyable cap to the DCEU. Thanks James Wan.","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

Becoming more Jason Mamoa than Aquaman, the serious badass from the other installments is reduced to a flailing comedian, complete with a goofy battle cry. Black Manta (Yahya Abdul Mateen II) was previously a standout, but the mind control element used here gives him a stale delivery, without adding anything to his character. His henchmen army are given a nauseating amount of screen time and only use it to be increasingly annoying with every seen. The plot is quite similar to the previous film, keeping most of the story beats, but inserting Orm (Patrick Wilson) in the buddy adventure role previously filled by the now scarcely seen Mera (Amber Heard). Orm does his best to make this as watchable as he can, giving the most charming performance in the film. Unfortunately, that is not enough to save it from the astonishingly boring story, with very little memorable moments to make it stand out. Fighting the urge to leave the theater early, I could not help but wish that I waited for this to come to streaming. After a decade of hobbling along, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom brings the DCEU to an end, not with a whimper, but with an embarrassingly shrill yelp.","22 out of 35 found this helpful.

Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom has a better soundtrack than 1, amazing action, some charming bits everything else was average. I understand hating Amber Heard the best thing about her in this is shes's sexy throughout and more respectable before the drama that occurred in the last couple years now she's most likely staying cancelled.

What we got here was a mishmash of random scenes, poor CGI, actors who looked as though they just couldn't be bothered and the end of the DC universe ahead of its reboot.I really, really wish we had got to see where the universe was SUPPOSED to go before it was Wheldon destroyed the Justice League film as, with Man of Steel, Batman V Superman, Wonder-woman, Aquaman (for me the weakest of films) and the Snyder-cut of JL - I honestly believe it was building to something great.With WW2, The Flash and now this - it felt more like they just were just rushing stuff to ""finish it"" so Gunn could reboot it. We will see what he does with it but with the handling of this film and Peter Saffron's ""screw the fans"" attitude - I have very little hope.Like The Flash, I honestly don't think this is even worth your time watching on a streaming service.

The editing turns out to be of quality and emphasizes the action scenes so as not to be a completely boring film. James Wan's work as a director is weak, horror films are definitely his thing. Digital special effects achieve good computer-generated characters in terms of marine fauna, such as the cephalopod and the sea horse, but in action scenes and in the creation of landscapes or buildings, these digital effects turn out to be bad and false before the viewer's view. ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom"" is a movie with a decent but boring story that barely escapes being considered bad.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

For the most part I did.It's fun, silly at times with flaws but it's not boring and definitely not the worst superhero film of the year. The chemistry between Arthur and Orm are great (my favorite part).The scenes between Arthur and Manta are good too. The CGI is fine but at times is very messy and hard to tell what's going on but I guess that suits the story. The story is very basic and a bit all over the place. One minute they are here, one minute they are there and nothing really connecting it.Any potential funny moments fall flat because of the forceful nature of them. Also this film has way too many cut to black screens (I think 4 in total). Very lazy editing and could have been done better to make the film feel like it was free flowing.Overall I think the DC universe ended on a good note but it's very clear that they need their a head of the universe (ie james gunn) so that there's and identity and its actually going somewhere. 6.5/10.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

I have this thing that I am not watching any trailers or not reading much about the movies before I watch them - i believe this maximises chances for not knowing anything about the movie I watch and makes it more like back in 90s when we could only look at the VHS box and judge if we want or not want to watch the movie.I think it was pretty cool and I am always looking forward for any DC productions.I saw there was plenty low scores here - idk why.

It was enough there to make you follow the plot, but other than that - there wasn't much there. Could it have been better? Yes. Does that kill the movie? No.This movie is more like a guilty pleasure for me and I would watch it because of the world of Aquaman and all of its details. This is were the movie really shines.

And the action is good, too.So, if you want a deep and very good story, you might be disappointed.But if you are somebody to enjoy a fun and very well made ""Superhero Aquaman theme park ride"", a classical ""grab yourself a bag of popcorn and turn your brain off"" movie - this one may be for you.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"6","/10","""Aquaman 2"" is a competent fun that tries to cover several themes, but ends up not being relevant to any of them. It's a bittersweet end to the old DCEU","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9614780/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","10 February 2024","Marking the end of a universe of poorly conceived films, the sequel to ""Aquaman"" is a consequence, if we can remember correctly, of the few moments that the DCEU managed to shine. Even though it was racing to catch up with the MCU - bringing together the heroes in Justice League - it was with the solo films that the studio was able to take a slice of the shared universes race while still having the public's hype. After the successful run of Arthur Curry's debut on the big screen, the last time Warner celebrated with DC in theaters was in 2019, with ""Shazam"", which received good critical and box office reception and going against the grain, it didn't matter if the extended franchise struggled to deliver a minimally entertaining result as the public's appreciation for long superhero films was lost. But behold, we return to the seven seas to say goodbye to a suffering universe, while Warner moves towards its new era of redemption and promises.The taste of delay in ""Aquaman 2: The Lost Kingdom"" is inevitable. Conceived as a sequel to the DC Universe's biggest box office hit on the big screen, the film opens now that this franchise has been declared dead and is preparing to be reborn. As if that weren't enough, the moment with the superheroes is one of disbelief, thanks to an increasingly concrete exhaustion. A series of challenges that work against a project that is comfortable with just repeating the dose of the first in an excited, mindless and proudly cheesy adventure. The new adventure finds Aquaman (Jason Momoa) dealing with changes in his two worlds. In addition to his duties as King of Atlantis, a thankless position due to the way his subjects do not follow him, he now needs to raise Arthur Jr, the son he had with Mera (Amber Heard). It turns out that the double journey becomes the least of the hero's problems when Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) returns with an ancient power in search of revenge that could condemn the entire world.With a new premise in hand, the team responsible for the feature bets on repeating the formula of the previous film, including using flashbacks to establish the idea of unity. The combination of fun and action spectacle with touches of horror returns almost unchanged. A question that, although on paper it seemed like a good idea, in practice says something else. The highlight, to no one's surprise, is the action. Increasingly comfortable in the genre, director James Wan fulfills the task of creating an underwater audiovisual spectacle with flying colors. The chase and beating sequences are conducted with enough care and creativity to hypnotize and make the audience feel each blow. It helps that the filmmaker tempers this superhero adventure with horror, his other specialty. There are several moments in which the suspense creates tension that leads to a fight or sets the plot in motion. A direction that gives the production the perfect excuse to invest in more monsters - both aquatic and earthly - that scare, fuel the action and help expand this corner of the DC universe.It is no surprise that Wan opens his range of tributes in the most diverse areas of production, whether with the epic and dissonant soundtrack by Rupert Gregson-Williams, which mixes synthesizers with powerful orchestral string instruments, or with stylistic forays that recall icons of the Seventh art like ""The Lord of the Rings"". Each gear is carefully thought out to deliver a solid experience to viewers, even if not every attack works. Over approximately two hours, Wan reiterates his importance in the entertainment scene by involving us in an explosive universe that still has a lot to tell us - and the director's explorations conflict with themselves with drastic changes of scenery (from colorful exuberance from the bottom of the sea, to the ultimate isolating despair of the Sahara, to the grim desolation of the lost kingdom known as Necrus). More than that, he is helped by great performances, highlighting the chemistry between Momoa and Wilson, who provide unprecedented layers to memorable pop culture characters.The structure of the work comments on the need for environmental preservation and the impact that humans have on marine and terrestrial life. However, the reflections promoted by this iteration are elevated to the nth degree in an interesting mix of horror, comedy, drama and adventure. Unfortunately, ""Aquaman 2: The Lost Kingdom"" is not just about action and leaves something to be desired in practically everything else. David Leslie Johnson-McGoldrick's script is simplistic and fails to create a cohesive narrative. In addition to being dependent on flashbacks from the previous one to work, the text is confusing when bringing and discarding characters without much explanation, which fragments the arc of practically all of them. The film creates forced sequences disguised as motivations and actions, as if a few lines of dialogue and an exciting battle sequence in the sequel could sweep the issues under the rug. An approach that both text and direction try to recognize by being self-indulgent with the shortcuts they take. However, this veneer of honesty quickly melts revealing that, in fact, the problem lies deeper.In an attempt to disguise weaknesses with jokes, ""The Lost Kingdom"" seems desperate for the public to laugh ""with him"", but not ""at him"". This is shown in the way the film fails when trying to transition between different tones. The transition from a serious moment to a slapstick comedy is constant and always abrupt, making it difficult to understand the gravity of the situations and how the characters face them. This problem, in particular, hits Jason Momoa's Aquaman hard, who takes on different personalities throughout the film. The King of the Seas is somewhere between the usual facade of a badass bombshell and something cartoonish to the point of flirting with Looney Tunes while echoing other heroes, such as Superman and even Spider-Man. A confusion that highlights the desperation of a search for identity. A strange issue to say the least, considering that the first Aquaman was made by the same team and not only had it established a personality for the character, but also knew how to move between different genres and tones without seeming truncated. It's inevitable to think about studio interference, but finding someone to blame doesn't change the fact that the film seems like a mixture of several elements in a cauldron, but without the flavor of yesteryear.In any case, the more somber the discourse of these works, the less believable they really appear. Aquaman (Jason Momoa) fights the extremely dangerous villain (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), now equipped with the gigantic power of a trident. The evil guy threatens to mistreat the superhero's newborn son, for the simple pleasure of doing so. He also promises to destroy all of humanity, without thinking that this might include him. The antagonists of superhero narratives are nothing more than blackmailers, childish brutes, in constant need of attention and social validation.Two hours later, surprise: good wins over evil. There are at least five scenes in which a character is about to die at the hands of an opponent, armed with lightning or a sharp dagger. Before delivering the fatal blow, the latter launches into a pompous speech about his intentions (didn't the victim already know this?). One second before death, the individual is saved by someone who appears behind the enemy's back, strikes a blow or stops a weapon flying through the air. The day is saved once again. The day will always be saved. In the end, the danger does not exist. The Earth has never trembled in the face of a real threat. We never really believed that Arthur Curry could succumb. If he died, some convenient magic could bring him back to life. If Marvel destroys half of humanity in the snap of a finger, it can resurrect it with equal ease, if these companies deem it necessary to do so. It's not so much about reaching the viewer with zeal, but more about repositioning the franchise in a market that the MCU dominated, that of family entertainment, and to that end Arthur Curry not only becomes a father but all his concerns in the plot involves the theme of blood ties. In this second film, Jason Momoa seems more out of place in the role of the good guy - his relationship with his half-brother Orm brings tears to Aquaman's eyes - and the immediate effect of this is that the actor is unable to escape an ironic interpretation. Even the irony in ""Aquaman 2,"" however, seems to hover within a committee-controlled range. It's the irony of citing the ending of ""Iron Man (2008)"", for example, with the full awareness that the public no longer expects anything new from this medium beyond self-references. ""The Lost Kingdom"" does not dare to embark on a sentimental nostalgia like that of ""Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)"" or even ""The Flash (2023)"", because that would involve a greater dose of authorial commitment; Her nostalgia already brings with it fatigue and that is why she shamelessly adopts the safe game of self-irony.It turns out that between the mess and the good ideas, ""Aquaman 2: The Lost Kingdom"" has enough material to please and displease anyone who checks out the DCEU's last breath. In its favor, the film has an honesty that was presented in the first scene. By making a parallel between the hero's great adventures and playing with dolls, the film is frank in not promising to be more than that. It's not a grand finale for the DC Cinematic Universe, nor is it the answer to genre fatigue. It's an uncompromising game that, like the first one, can amuse anyone looking for an adrenaline rush. This film is competent fun that tries to cover several themes, but ends up not being relevant to any of them. It's a bittersweet end to the DCEU, leaving a taste of more while sharing many of the signs of the decline of the era of heroes in cinema.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Sure, there was nothing you wouldn't expect: a basic over the top superhero movie with a super villain and just-in-time saviors. However, it was still enjoyable and the storyline about family and the light humor, was refreshing.What bothered me is that they were few parts of the story line that were rather thin. The new super powerful resource wasn't really used (except to cause intentional climate change!?). The huge monster from the beginning basically just dissapeared? The entire new world they discovered on an island was entirely pointless to the story? Throwing all these things in there just distracted from the main story in my opinion. Better work with less, but do a better job. It didn't ruin the movie though.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

There was certainky no point where the movie dragged or was boring.Personally I would plhave preferred a more serious Aquaman the humour in this is corny as hell rather than refreshing and honestly a lot of the acting in this was pretty mediocre, but it didn't make the movie less watchable or enjoyable.I feel like the story didn't get into the head of Black Manta enough, which made him a fairly boring and uninteresting villain.Randall Park was his usual adorable self.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This mess of a movie is the victim of a LOT of interference from the powers that be at Warner. It truly is a ChatGPT meets midjourney production.Such a shame as the first film was such a smash hit and though it was a big story and big production there was cohesiveness. This...seems like Wan and the writer got so frustrated with Warners meddling they just gave up or actively sabotaged this film.There are some good production design moments such as leaving into an almost 'steam punk' meets the '60s mod with the 'ancient' machines. The contact lenses on Arthur look so bad... and then they disappear. The CGI for Kidman and Head, melding their faces onto stunt doubles or just cgi animation is astounding...There are a LOT of plot holes, a LOT of goofs.. it's just riddled with problems. And to have to hear Mamoa do that stupid 'whohoo' squeal again... he delivered a great Aquaman in the beginning but has exhausted it very quickly. Glad he is being retired from the role.Glad to see this DCU is finally being put to rest...","10 out of 15 found this helpful.

I liked the Flash, despite having grievances with the effects, I didn't mind Blue Beetle, but never really remembered much of it, and I absolutely despised Shazam 2, and have it within my bottom 10 DC films.So, with that in mind, where does Aquaman 2 go? I'd say it's above Blue Beetle, but below the Flash. A2 looked better in terms of effect and fight choreography than the other 2023 films, and it had a faster pace as well, so the film was easy to stay with in its runtime.If I had to point out negatives, there's only one con, but it's a big one: Not a lot happens in this movie.The action and spectacle are nice. And that's about it. Not a lot of story, nothing it stands out from, and doesn't feel like a finale. For being the last film in the first phase of the DCEU, it felt like it ended not with a bang, but with a ""Okay then"".Even still, it's a film I can tolerate, and it doesn't offend. If this film was a food, it would be a bowl of unsalted crackers with a bottle of room temperature Gatorade. Consumable, but not perfect. 6/10. C Tier.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I felt like I was watching an Indian soap opera or Bollywood movie. Aquaman lost kingdoms is what happens if you give the responsibility for making a movie to Twitter lefties, and I say this is a leftie. There's just too much cringe. The only character I felt mildly interested in was Orm. The villain looks like he was only hired for diversity, he sparks no fascination nor fear and he is stiff all the time, so are most of the crew members. Except for one person, it is not explained at all why the rest of his crew are so on board with what can only be considered self demise, they have no skin in the game, who are THEY trying to avenge? I think Aquaman makes a sub decent movie as a comedy for how ridiculous it is, or a good movie for kids for all the animation but that's about it. Jason tries to be the goofy superhero archetype but ends up being silly almost always. Amber is ... just there for some reason, she cannot act at all and her only purpose is to save Jason out of thin air... multiple times. I couldn't at all be invested in their family dynamic, again maybe people who are on outing with kids may appreciate it more. Overall I don't recommend it and I didn't enjoy it.","13 out of 21 found this helpful.

The action sequences are non stop and the special effects are really top notch. I think the storyline is just fine.Jason Momoa is great in this movie and perfect for bringing a level of ""coolness"" to the Aquaman character. He makes the character badass and that is something this character has not been in the past for DC especially in the comics or cartoons.Hey the movie will not be known for its artistic content. But who cares ... It's a fun couple hours to relax and enjoy an entertaining movie.It always drives me crazy how these user reviews are so critical with superhero movies.

I am admirer however of director James Wan creative journey through hollywood ladder. He has proven in the past that he is capable of creating successful franchises, which continue to this day.It's without a doubt tall task working on this type of big blockbusters full of visual effects and unlike Martin Scorsese I do appreciate the artistry and hard work involved in working on this time of visual extravaganza. However, the risk that comes with CGI based movies is that it might become, excuse my comparison...a visual diarrhea...
There is so much going on here in the frame, that the audience sometimes is unable to absorb all the visual stimuli and worse yet when the physics of the visual effects feels wrong, lacking weight to be fully believable we can easily feel overwhelmed.As larger portion of the 'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom' happens under water, we as the audience can be distracted from actors performance by looking at their floating hair.There are many moments where scenes look like PlayStation 5 gaming scenes lacking reality in how characters move, looking more like cartoon avatars with only heads put in for narrative performance value.The plot is rather simple:
'Black Manta seeks revenge on Aquaman for his father's death. Wielding the Black Trident's power, he becomes a formidable foe. To defend Atlantis, Aquaman forges an alliance with his imprisoned brother. They must protect the kingdom.'Honestly with everything that happens on screen there is a tendency to actually get bored and not really follow the storyline. Perhaps it's a pacing issue as often there is too much action going on, instead of character development. The thing is after a while we tend to not really care about well being of any of the characters, which in essence is the main key for viewer engagement. The performances are full of stereotypical Hollywood mannerisms. The comical moments don't land as often as they should and in general there is potential of boardroom setting in, which is strange considering all the visual depth on screen.This type of movies need to be foremost entertaining and if your mind starts to make shopping list during screening, then something is not right. I am sure that there will be viewers, which will be semi entertained, but sadly I was not one of them. Again the performances are descent specially from charismatic Yahya Abdul-Mateen II and playful Jason Momoa as well as aging Patrick Wilson, but as a complete entertainment product
'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom' feels narratively lacking, as too much emphasis is put on visual action and not enough on solid character development. If you decide to check this film out in the cinema, make sure to choose seats further from the screen so you have enough distance to absorb all the visual extravaganza without feeling overwhelmed.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Orm, (Patrick Wilson) carries a galant-seriousness to the story that Arthur (Jason Momoa) does not deliver. Arthur looks great wearing his flashy scales but most of the time has a laid-back presence even in battle scenes that subtracts from the movie. Arthur fall sleep as king as the jokester king of Atlantis. Atlanna, (Nicole Kidman) was spectacular in a supporting role. Dr. Shin, (Randall Park) also played a knowledgeable, self-conscious scientist invested in learning and deep desire to see Atlantis. Black Manta, (Yahya Abdul-Manteen II) nails his hatred for Arthur and all of Atlantis. My favorite character, Mera, (Amber Heard) captivates the screen with her presence and super-powers. She is the main mom, royal wife, super warrior of the film. Overall, the story of good vs evil is fought with advanced and old destructive technology. It could be a message to the world of the effects of petroleum on climate. Kudos to all the departments that showed great costumes, set design, action/special effects, sound and color to deliver approximately a good two hours of film.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

At least I don't feel it is. But I doubt it will make many top lists (be it year or genre or anything else for that matter). It does look good and I reckon James Wan knows how to shoot a movie. There are quite a few jokes that do not really work - and quite a bit of editing that feels off ... just suspend your disbelief and go with the flow (of water).The ending is also a bit anti-climatic and there is not much in the way of sense ... also try not to use logic! Or think the movie applies it. Furthermore, this does not only use an actor you may recognize from a small role in the MCU ... but it also copies one particular (and very famous) ending from an MCU movie ... I swim therefor I am I guess. Not the mic drop moment the movie thinks it is.The CGI is good - but the whole movie feels a bit off. It is a nice touch that it sometimes does things without dialog, just with the actors nodding to each other ... and yet this feels weird - and not in a good sense. After watching the movie I watched the Pitch Meeting that was made for this (a real funny Youtube channel that I can highly recommend) ... the super easy, barely an inconvenience quote is easy to guess - if you have seen the movie.A weird way to end the current DCEU ... but as they would say: The King is dead, long live the King (not literally of course)","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Despite the ocean of opinions surrounding the DCEU, I've found enjoyment in several entries, with my primary gripe being the lack of a united vision due to studio interference.In this aquatic adventure, the passage of time has not been kind. The cinematic landscape has shifted, and unfortunately, so has the film's narrative cohesion. The interference is evident in tonal shifts and edits that impact the overall project.At its core, the movie yearns to be a buddy cop film, pairing Arthur and Orm in a tag-team aquatic escapade. Patrick Wilson's increased presence is a delight, but the absence of Willem Dafoe leaves a void. Amber Heard's contribution adds as much depth as a shallow tide, delivering a performance that is as flat as the ocean horizon.Yahya Abdul-Mateen II returns with grandiosity as Black Manta, portraying a more maniacal and crazed villain. However, the film is a mixed bag, oscillating between successful and lacking elements. The comedy is hit or miss, CGI alternates between amazing and cheap, and the action sequences range from inventive to nonsensical.While not riding the same wave as its predecessor, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom concludes the franchise on a middling note. It serves as a reminder that the DCEU journey has been marred by studio mismanagement, and unfortunately, they've yet to learn from their missteps. Ultimately, it's a final dive that doesn't quite make the splash it could have.FORMAT: CinemaVIDEO: 10/10.4K theatrical presentation, Detail level: Excellent, Colour reproduction: Excellent, Level accuracy: Excellent, Encode: Excellent, Master condition: ExcellentAUDIO: 10/10.Dolby Atmos audio, Dialogue reproduction: Excellent, Soundtrack & effects clarity: Excellent, Dynamics: Excellent, Surround sound presentation: Excellent, LFE content: ExcellentMOOFIEMETER: 6/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I mean, it's basically on Spy Kids level.Doesn't really help that Amber is still in it, no matter how long she's playing, it's just annoying to see her.So, if you want a trip down nostalgia lane, if you want to rewatch Schumacher's Batman & Robin, you might wanna watch this instead, to see a worse acted, worse scripted version.","10 out of 16 found this helpful.

If you liked the first film, then you'll thoroughly enjoy this one. It had all the same elements that made the first one so great- Visually awesome FX, epic action with great fight choreography, and that James Wan flair of gnarly creatures. We had an absolute blast.Reviewers are dissing the dialogue for being overly silly and campy but are they forgetting this is based off superhero comic books!? They're trying to intellectualize and dissect something that is meant to be pure fun which it was.The first Aquaman is my favorite superhero movie, solely for the reasons listed above and this one is a very worthy addition to both the DC franchise and James Wan's legacy.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

This is my fault. I didn't have to watch this, but I chose to anyway.After watching Argylle, I thought for sure nothing I watched next could be worse. Well, I was horribly mistaken! This film makes Argylle look like a masterpiece.The last film of this DCEU is a whimper, just barely having enough juice to shill out this weak execuse of a DC film.Horrible story, horrible writing, cringe worthy dialogue with jokes that made me roll eyes continuously, downright atrocious cgi that is bordering on criminal. It should be illegal to subjugate audiences to this mess.By the time I reached the first hour, I was more than ready to walk out of the theater, but I decided to stay as I was curious to see how they wanted to end this trash.The plot makes no sense! If these people of The Lost Kingdom are such a danger to the world, why imprison them? Literally kill them, so an idiot with a petty vendetta doesn't just happen upon them. Worst of all, nobody could learn how dangerous these people were because, well, any knowledge of this kingdom was erased from Atlantis's history. Once again, proving those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it.Anyway...Aquaman and The Lost Kingdom was exactly what I thought it was going to be bad! At least this DCEU is finally over, and perhaps James Gunn can do some good with his upcoming DC plans. We will see.IMDb: 1/10

Sure, it has its moments, but overall it is a disaster of a movie. I didn't mind the first movie, but with this one, it's like they forgot how they made it. It's pure visual noise - a dumb, forgettable, ""kitchen-sink"" kind of movie that lacks substance. Aquaman 2 suffers from nearly every issue currently plaguing the superhero genre, such as an over-reliance on goofy comedy, a weak script with a bland, campy narrative, a forgettable villain, a lack of emotional stakes, iffy CGI, an overuse of needle drops, little to no character development, appalling dialogue, a rushed story that prioritizes action/spectacle and doesn't even take itself seriously. The film just has no dignity - doing whatever it can for a cheap laugh or what it thinks is a cool moment in the way we've seen Thor: Love and Thunder and Quantumania do - even ending with a joke version of the ""I am Iron Man"" moment. It was just way too silly and goofy, never feeling tonally like a DC or Aquaman movie should. Instead, it plays like a cartoonish family-friendly adventure film like Jumanji or Journey 2: The Mysterious Island. I didn't even find it that much fun. The highlight of the film is easily Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson's chemistry, as seeing Arthur and Orm in a sort of buddy road-trip movie was enjoyable, but even Momoa drove me nuts at times - way overdoing it and playing himself rather than Aquaman. Wilson was easily the MVP of the movie but was so underutilized. I did like the attempt to have a message about climate change and pollution/emissions, but I didn't think it hit as hard as it should/could have. James Wan again goes hard for the film's action scenes with some dynamic camerawork but this was trite, bland, and visually ugly to look at. Ultimately this movie is an underwhelming mess. I feel sad for the movie and for the people involved as it has no dignity and ends up being laughable. So much for a grand finale to the DCEU - instead, this was embarrassing. It isn't completely unwatchable, just not good and not that much fun. Full of cliches and wasted potential. But hey, it was better than The Flash - even if it does make Quantumania look like Citizen Kane... what a terrible end to an already bad year for superhero films. Should've been called Aquaman and the Lost Screenplay.Goodbye to the DCEU... despite some moments, I don't think we'll miss you. Now, onto the DCU in 2025... I really hope this time they get it all right!","19 out of 35 found this helpful.

His life is thrown into further chaos when an old nemesis has grown in power and attacks his kingdom. With his mentor gone, Arthur turns to his brother in hopes of saving the world.The long overdue and drama-filled sequel of Aquaman, and what is essentially the last movie in the current DC Extended Universe. The movie is longer than it needs to be, the CGI is questionable in certain parts, and the action is all right. The story is decent for what it is worth; it expands on the characters already mentioned and has a good theme. The only thing missing in the story is a connection to the other movies or characters in the universe.

But in my opinion, I think few technical things made this movie terrible. The movie felt it was handed from a director to another. It was so obvious the movie ran into so many reshoots and re-writing. The scenes where they tried so much to shadow Amber (because we all know why) were very terribly edited. There were a couple of scenes with slow-motion that looked like a scene from the 80s, that's not James Wan style, those were also terribly edited.Overall, the movie felt so rushed and so inconsistent. One last thing, is that I think this movie was first 2:30 but DC wanted it to be 2hrs. So again, DC single handedly ruin their movies.. Overall if those technicalities were addressed, we would have seen an above average movie regardless of the weak writing.In the positive side, a few fighting/chasing scenes looked awesome, definitely were James Wan style.PS: I have a feeling that we will hear an explanation from James Wan in the near future. That's not a movie he would approve of.","19 out of 35 found this helpful.

Black Mantra is back, still intent on revenge for his father's death. This time he has discovered technology from Ancient Atlantis, frozen in ice but accessible due to Global Warming resulting on melting ice. This includes a ""haunted"" trident, a submarine and some cool bathyscaphes with tentacles. The submarine is a bit dodgy, reminiscent of Seaview with it's large viewing ports. So Aquaman has another battle if not a war to fight. He also finds that being King of Atlantis isn't easy, especially when he wants to spend half of his time on dry land. Did I mention that Black Mantra is using arcane power sources to increase global Warming and has a Bond Villain style hollow volcano base? Black Mantra has mysteriously enhanced powers so Aquaman has to get an old enemy to join in his struggles against the Mantra. There are interesting surprises and plit twisrs which would spoil your fun if I revealed them here. A line of humour runs through this film and prevents it from taking itself too seriously.

He is struggling to rule his kingdom and maintain peace with the surface dwellers as his council opposes his views. David Kane with the help of a marine biologist Dr. Shin, discovers an ancient kingdom which allows him to get hold of black trident with extraordinary powers. What's in this mysterious ancient kingdom and how Arthur must reach out to his brother in order to fight back the new bigger threat and overall save the surface dwellers as well as Atlanteans, forms rest of the story.James Wan and his brigade of writers have come up with an oversimplified story filled with enough action scenes and the brothers' banter that simply is not enough to lift this film out of boredom. The film is definitely not bad but it is pretty overstuffed and extremely generic, making the 2hrs runtime feel too long. It only works in parts but the hyped visuals don't leave a mark. Much of the PG humor for the festival season is passable at best and the actors do their best to salvage this film. The villain remains weak, both of them and even the supposed evil plan doesn't evoke any sort of intrigue. I am going with a lenient rating just because the makers are aware of their product and stuck to making the best of what they can.","45 out of 94 found this helpful.

Aquaman and his brother scouring the land for ancient energy? They must have taken a wrong turn at Albuquerque-because this plot runs on less logic than a gasless car! Between Black Manta's suit looking more suited for an ant farm and Amber Heard's performance as if she's still in court, 'Aquaman' flounders more than it flows. Honestly, I left early; even the lure of the sea couldn't keep me anchored to my seat. This movie makes a case for diving back into 'Pirates of the Caribbean'-at least their treasures are worth the watch! Even the fish in the sea would swim away from this script, and the only thing worth saving was my popcorn from drowning in tears of laughter.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Well not for long! ""Black Manta"" (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is still a tad narked after the last film (five years ago!) and now armed with an useful geek ""Dr. Shin"" (Randall Park) sets out to discover a secret trident that will enable him to destroy ""Atlantis"" altogether and maybe also release the long captive ""Kordax"" (wasn't that the stuff they used to make telephone cables from?) to help make his revenge complete. Initially hopelessly outgunned by his nemesis's sonic gun, he has to resort to the drastic step of rescuing his imprisoned brother ""Orm"" (Patrick Wilson) - whom you may recall he was instrumental in deposing and incarcerating in the first place; and hoping that he will join forces with them, ""Atlanna"" (Nicole Kidman) and ""King Nereus"" (an almost unrecognisable Dolph Lundgren). With battles lines drawn the films goes from ""Narnia"" to ""Middle Earth"" via the ""Lost World"" and even a bit of ""Ice Station Zebra"" for a series of ploddingly slow and disappointing set-piece adventures. To be fair, the last half hour does lift the pace a little, but by then I'm not sure if it wasn't all just a rather too late. Momoa is trying very hard here, but he's no Dwayne Johnson, and even the dulcets of John Rhys-Davies as the ""Brine King"" - with or without his claw - can't really raise this from it's pretty weak and feeble doldrums. Of course it looks good, loads of quality CGI and visual effects, but the story is light and overly strung out for two hours that really did feel more like two days at times. It's harmless fodder for Christmas cinema with very little to actually dislike about it - it's just the latest in a series of equally forgettable super-hero films that I suspect will leave no impact at all in the snow afterwards.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie tries to sell Momoa and Wilson, as the Thor and Loki of this universe with personalities reversed and even references that directly but doesn't really have the same effect at all. There's enough stuff here to keep you looking at the screen but never enough to be actually interested in it as a whole.","19 out of 37 found this helpful.

Obviously it is the typical theme of every superheroes movie but at least you guys can execute it differently. I don't know, obviously this guy know better. I think I'm gonna hold myself from watching supe movie again, gonna rewatch Breaking Bad for entertaining storyline.

He did a pretty good job considering all the stress involved with completing this final DCEU film. Don't pay attention to the naysayers, It's not Oppenheimer, but it's still a fun film to watch and enjoy on its own merits. I really enjoyed the deeper familial explorations between the brothers and rest of family. I wouldn't have minded if Jame's had taken the film in more of the horror genre direction with the monsters from the trench but the story line was still satisfying. He did manage to weave in many of today's key global themes of climate climate change and governments & people needing to work together to solve some of the world's most pressing, complex problems.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

From start to finish, the film feels like a desperate attempt to cash in on the success of its predecessor without bringing anything new to the table.The storyline is as shallow as a tide pool, recycling tired tropes of heroism and villainy without any semblance of originality. Characters are cardboard cutouts, devoid of depth or development, leaving audiences struggling to connect or care about their fate.Jason Momoa's charisma, which carried the first film, is drowned out by a script that fails to give him anything meaningful to work with. Supporting cast members fare no better, with performances ranging from wooden to cringe-inducing.But perhaps the film's biggest offense is its reliance on CGI spectacle over substance. Every frame is saturated with over-the-top visual effects that serve as a poor substitute for genuine storytelling. The result is a bloated, soulless spectacle that leaves viewers feeling more waterlogged than entertained.In the end, ""Aquaman 2"" proves to be a tidal wave of disappointment, washing away any hope for redemption in this floundering franchise.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

I nearly did not go to the cinema since everyone was bashing it, lowkey expecting a hastily thrown together movie to save face but quite the opposite was the case.Instead this felt tried and tested, it had flaws sure but it had a stronger red thread then the first movie. Especially the relationship between the two brothers, considering where they start off and end up.What also hurts a bit ist that no one is mentioning the countless homages to classic films ranging from 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea and The Land That Time Forgot. James Wan really did care for this and pulled out his inner kid for this one.The plot line played out like a Young Justice league episode with Going to a tropical island to save the day. But hold on, they even made the bad guys relatable to a degree of course. Not to give too much away but the movie starts off like they are the protagonists, and it's actually quite good.Not to mention, James Wan's horror roots shine through everywhere, he just can't hide it. That's probably my only gripe, I would have liked to see a more adult version of this where he doesn't need to hold back and can go full horror monster under the sea.Sorry if I am ranting a bit, but this film is better than the rating suggests. I am not saying its a masterpiece .. sure I get it, a lot of people are mad at the whole DCEU debacle, I didn't even watch the latest entries like black adam or blue Beetle but that doesn't mean you need to bash everything that comes out of the same universe. I am aware of the Amber Heard situation but people should be able to separate the actor from the character.This was a very enjoyable popcorn flick, me and my wife had a good time watching it and I am sure plenty of other people will too.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

I had a ball of a time, actually, as the camaraderie, chemistry, and banter between Momoa's Aquaman and Wilson's Orm made sure that you consistently have a good time despite the movie's inherent shortcomings. Their chemistry and the duo's performances are worth the price of admission alone.

Black Manta honestly was really, really cool in this sequel and the fight scenes that took place in this movie were what I expect superhero films to do more of when it comes to beings going toe-to-toe with super strength. The fight scenes that take place towards the end of the movie is what I was hoping for Ant-Man 3, The Flash, and The Marvels to show us so I appreciate James Wan and everyone else who worked on the editing and fight choreography. After seeing this movie, I wish this wasn't the end of the DCEU, or Jason Momoa's Aquaman. I don't know how Gunn is going to top it, but it will be interesting to see.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Don¬¥t ask me where the PG-13 comes from. Disney¬¥s Atlantis is edgier and more mature. Basically what happened with the Shazam sequel but the step down there was more noticeable due to the prequel being a more coherent film. Most of the CG work is the one thing that can be praised but Avatar 2 this is not. What can be? The PS3 cutscene action scenes are also a bit forgettable.If you wanna see a dude bro YouTuber and his too cool for school brother hang out with cartoon characters and randomly jump from one Lego Set set piece to the next this is your film. But isn¬¥t this what mid-budget streaming films are for and not wide-release blockbusters? Can¬¥t say I hate the film despite being a fan of Aquaman. Wan is too talented to be fully derailed by studio demands and 2 (?) rounds of reshoots but I H A T E what Wan did to Black Manta. Especially here. He turned Aquaman¬¥s Bane into Joel Schumacher¬¥s Bane to keep it short and he is possessed by Warcraft¬¥s Lich King for some reason. Whedon¬¥s Steppenwolf had more dignity and screen presence! The plot also lacks stakes despite being a save-the-planet story.Rest in baby piss DCEU and no way in hell will I acknowledge that The Lost Box Office makes sense as a sequel or is in any way related to ZSJL. The 3 Snyder films, WW1 and Shazam 1 are the only DCEU entries I will ever revisit and I couldn¬¥t be more glad that none of the many reboots worked out for WB. Who knew that catering to Funko Pop Critics and Redditors was a bad idea... The DCU too will fail if this goes on and the film's producer is the co-lead of DC right now despite mostly flops to his name. Sigh. 5/10PS: Mera is barely in the film and Heard¬¥s lines have been cut down to nothing. All exposition and her father has more lines! It¬¥s almost comical how transparent it is but she is in acts 1 and 3, technically. So no camp who is still on about that divorce will be happy. That¬¥s WB for you. Making CBMs for no one unless they are set in Gotham.","30 out of 65 found this helpful.

Not only the outcome of this film but the state of comic blockbusters these days and more specifically the standard level at Warner Bros./DC.I'll be honest I barely remember the first film, I thought it was just average to ok and never watched it again. So to be honest I had no expectations going into this whatsoever, more confusion than anything given the circumstances at Warner Bros. This film was made and released into a cinematic connected universe that no longer exists. So much so there is even a chance that Jason Momoa won't be returning in the future now that James Gunn is at the helm over at DC. It begs the question what was the point? Why not cancel it like ""Batgirl"" or had Warner Bros. Spent too much money, a bit like they had with ""The Flash"" and were forced into releasing it.I left watching this film just feeling overall sadness. This film is beyond poor in so many respects that it is a shadow of what I thought we were originally going to get from a DCEU. Over 10 years on from their original ""plan"" and a few years on from their massive course correction away from Snyder (more than once) this is what we get. A poor story, with poor writing with a film that feels just like a cash grab and a bad one at that. Nothing in this film made me excited, entertained or have a good time. Not huge amounts of CGI and action scenes can mask over the problems behind this film.Put a pig in a nice dress, is still a pig!I don't blame the actors that much, they all did their best. I do slightly blame James Wan for even agreeing to do it, why not just walk away? Unless of course he has future plans with the character? This mainly falls at the feet of the studio who have clearly given up on making quality over quantity. To be honest that goes for Marvel/Disney as well, in recent years it has been quantity over quality, only the very few good films have come out! Maybe this is the beginning of the end for comic book franchises?I'm not sure audiences really care for cross-over universes anymore, they just want to watch fantastic quality films! That comes first and foremost, then think about everything else. Sadly this film is neither! It is a poorly constructed film with no connection to anything (apart from maybe its previous film). Bad writing/dialogue, boring story and just dull uninteresting action seems with an obscene amount of CGI that isn't that impressive!30% out of 100 I'll probably forget about this film in a few hours!","15 out of 29 found this helpful.

When the credits rolled, I found myself pleasantly surprised. Is it the best DCEU movie? Not even close. Is it as good as the first one? Nope. Is it a fun superhero movie that people should enjoy on the big screen? Yes.My biggest gripe with the movie is the pacing. The first 20+ minutes are a bit slow as they set the stage for Aquaman's current life, which has changed since the first movie. Another obvious issue is the very minor presence of Amber Heard in the film. Although I get the off-screen reasoning, it still feels like a big miss.The core story is your typical sci-fi leap of faith stuff, but overall, I felt it was well executed. When the action starts, it never lets up, and the movie builds nicely to the final conflict. However, I found the very last scene to be a bit cheesy.The cast does a great job, and I enjoyed the humor. I do agree with other criticisms in that the screenplay feels a bit choppy. Sometimes, you can almost see the post-production rewrites or missing pieces that ended up on the cutting room floor. I thought the movie needed another 10 minutes or so to smooth out some of the rough/rushed areas.The VFX, sound effects, and score are very well done. I've always loved the Aquaman theme.If you liked the first Aquaman movie, then you should definitely see this one. Compared to the quality drop from Wonder Woman to WW1984, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is a lot of fun.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Screenplay and writing of this film could have been better.2. Casting performance is mediocre, except Jason and Patrick.3. Character Arcs are mediocre, could have been better.4. The film feels empty because of limited screentime of main characters of prequel, like Mera, Atlana, Artur's father and Vulko is missing from entire film.Final Thoughts and Review :-Overall, ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom"", is a good decent film to watch, and is a satisfying sequel with stunning visuals, Cinematography and action.

The movie wants to make a statement on global warming, but it's like watching a bad debate where the arguments made by the pro side are so bad they lose without any need for the other side to speak - score one for the climate deniers. Some of the special effects were good, only to be spoiled by an equal number of lackluster effects. The story was so bland and predictable I had to watch the second half at 2x speed to get through it. Much of the story, and characters, were borrowed from other comics. Take away Aquaman's trident and give him a hammer and you'd think this was a Thor film.

If this is the new DC universe then you can quit know. I had a hard time watching this movie, the acting and the whole premise of the movie. The only thing I liked was the part with the pirates and the fish that was singing. From the last 3 dc movies I watched: the flash, Aquaman and bluebeetle, this was the second worst.

A lot of what I liked about this film had to do with the visuals and sound, but I was also happy with the character utilization and development that was offered.There's a lot of flair going on when it comes to the fighting. It doesn't contain the most exhilarating fighting sequences, but it's enough to get my heart racing. While at times they're over the top in terms of what damage can be done to a superhero before they're exhausted. They're still entertaining and spread out enough throughout the film to keep me interested.I loved the soundtrack that went along with the film. It truly enhances the film to greater heights. The intensity of what happens next. The pulsation of the next attack. All of it go hand in hand with the music.Visually, this film is more toned down in terms of colour, but not in the vibrance or darkness when needed. With all the sea creatures that exist, the explosions that occur, and the unreal made real. This film does a perfect job in my eyes in maintaining the integrity of realism for things that are always easy to do, or are always skimmed over.I enjoyed the character utilization and development compared to the first film especially for Patrick Wilson. I didn't like him in the first film, but with better screen time here I do. As a character you can't remove Mera because of the important role she has, but her screen time seems to be less.The story isn't great, but it's not boring. Some aspects seem silly and others unnecessary, but it works out in the end. It's not as clear cut as I would like, but I can still follow what is being put down.Overall, it's still worth checking out, but not in 3D. I know ""Lost Kingdom"" is getting a lot of mediocre reviews, but it's not the worse superhero movie ever. Good visuals, great music, and enjoyable character development are what has really drawn me in.That's all for now. Thank you for taking the time to read my review. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

I thought that the story was very predictable and corny once the main villain revealed himself. The humor was good, with the exception of a few jokes that I didn't like; you'll know which ones when you see them. There was too much reliance on CGI and an overabundance of pulled-back shots, so you could see the pretty scenery while actors looked like ants. However, all this was tolerable because you could see how much Momoa really loves to play Aquaman, and he had a lot of fun carrying it on his broad shoulders. Thus, the whole chapter of DC movies was closed, and now we wait for Superman Legacy!","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

It is such slop. First of all, the CGI is garbage, with half of the scenes looking straight out of some PS4 game. In addition to this, the fight scenes are all pretty bad, there was about one that was good, and that was only partly because of how silly it all was. The movie has zero cohesion, a character quite literally gets injured and then spends 3/4ths of the movie gone, then somehow reappears out of nowhere. There is an entire subplot about the council of Atlantis that is completely abandoned, never brought up again. The worst part by far is the one-liners. Every single time something happens Aquaman needs to make some funny quip like it's some kind of knockoff marvel movie. The only time I laughed was at how ridiculous it all was. I get that the movie is going for a joking and light hearted tone, which Marvel proves you can do just fine with good writing. I don't even like Marvel, I'm much more of a DC fan. The only interesting thing about this movie is the ""Lost Kingdom"" and it's lore, but even then it's all just an exposition dump. This is probably the worst James Wan film I've seen and one of the worst superhero movies I've seen. Don't waste your time unless you find quips like ""uhhh did you see that?"" Hilarious.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Many action sequences suffer from poor choreography, marking a significant step down from the first film. Additionally, the song choices seem oddly out of place. The script is a messy and patched-up story with only a few redeeming moments.

Directed by James Wan, the film excels in its underwater world-building, creating breathtaking landscapes and seamlessly integrating CGI to bring Atlantis to life.One of the movie's strengths lies in its vibrant and dynamic underwater sequences, showcasing the beauty and danger of the ocean depths. The special effects are impressive, offering a visually immersive experience that captivates the audience. Jason Momoa reprises his role as Arthur Curry, bringing charisma and a sense of humor to the character, but even his strong performance can't fully compensate for the film's narrative shortcomings.The plot of ""Lost Kingdom"" treads familiar waters, as Arthur faces yet another threat to Atlantis and the surface world. While there are new elements introduced, including the exploration of ancient mysteries and the introduction of new characters, the overall storyline lacks the depth and originality needed to elevate it above mediocrity. The narrative feels formulaic, and certain plot twists may leave viewers with a sense of d√©j√† vu.Character development, aside from Arthur, takes a backseat, with some new additions feeling underdeveloped and lacking sufficient backstory. The ensemble cast, including Amber Heard as Mera and new faces like Pilou Asb√¶k, does its best with the material provided, but the script doesn't give them much room to shine.The pacing of the film is uneven, with moments of intense action followed by slower, exposition-heavy scenes that may leave the audience wishing for a more balanced rhythm. The film's length contributes to this, as some sequences could have been trimmed to create a more streamlined and engaging narrative.In terms of the soundtrack, the film delivers a fitting score that enhances the underwater atmosphere and complements the action sequences. However, it doesn't stand out as particularly memorable compared to other superhero movie soundtracks.In conclusion, ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom"" is a visually impressive but narratively average addition to the superhero genre. While it succeeds in providing entertaining moments and expanding the underwater universe, it falls short of delivering a truly exceptional cinematic experience. With a rating of 6/10, it's a film that may satisfy fans of the genre but leaves room for improvement in terms of storytelling and originality.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"6","/10","An Above Average Super Hero Sequel","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9525184/?ref_=tt_urv","alindsayal","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur147091341/?ref_=tt_urv","28 December 2023","After 10 years the DCEU has finally come to its end with Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. The first film was a big success both in terms of quality and financially but lots has happened since then and I watched the film today and here is my review. The premise of the film is set four years after the first with Arthur Curry as the King of Atlantis and a new father when a ghost from his past in Black Manta returns to try and destroy his world.Main Character
Jason Momoa is back as Arthur Curry/Aquaman and once again he is really good here. He is just clearly having a blast in the role and I think that really helps in terms of making you like the character. You can see that Arthur is really struggling with all of his responsibilities and though that is kind of pushed aside at certain parts I did like that it was included. With this probably being his last time playing the role, it is easy to say that Momoa has been great in this role and has added much needed freshness to the DC universe.Supporting Characters
Patrick Wilson reprises his role as Orm and he is a real highlight here. Momoa and Wilson's chemistry is easily the best thing about this film, there is charm but anger still there from the first film and both of them deliver there. I mean it is way to similar to Thor & Loki but that isn't Wilson's fault and he does an admirable job in the role.Randall Park made his return as Dr Stephen Shin from the post credit scene in the first Aquaman and he gets a sizeable role here which is great and he is a fun aspect of the film. He gets plenty of screen time and Park chews up the screen and just conveys his character really well.Yahya Abdul-Mateen II gets a bigger role as the main villain Black Manta this time and I have really mixed feelings here. I think Abdul-Mateen is doing his best and has a real presence on screen it is just the writing for his character that doesn't quite work. Black Manta is given plenty of screen time here but the film never evolves his motivations and his link to a certain object makes him feel like a secondary part of the film.Nicole Kidman and the much maligned Amber Heard are back from the first film as Atlanna and Mera but there roles are basically cut in half which in Heard's case makes complete sense. But it means they are really insignificant here and feel like they are just here because they were in the first film and not for any narrative reason.Story
The main factor of the story is the dynamic and relationship between Arthur & Orm and that is handled pretty well to be honest. The two of them have good chemistry together and it does feel like they are genuinely growing as people and with their relationship. The rest of the story is a mess, as mentioned above Black Manta's character is all over the place and isn't well written. Other characters are given nothing to do and it has an ending that is literally ripped from another comic book film.Script
This film isn't as serious as some of the other films in the DCEU. It has that banter in it and it is chuckle worthy for sure, but falls flat of really funny moments and writing that makes these characters really fun. The emotion also falls short and actually comes across as quite cringy which is a shame because there was quite a bit of potential here.Style
Recent comic book films have had some poor CGI but this films CGI is pretty good especially with the difficulties that come with a film that takes place underwater for a majority of it. Black Manta's costume in particular is awesome and one of the better designs in any recent comic book film. But the film is paced poorly, it was just pretty boring at times, especially in the first act. I felt like the film was way longer then it actually was and that is never a good thing.Overall
Overall, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is an above average sequel. It is a big drop off from the first film but it still is a pretty fun time at the cinema and has all the things you would expect from a superhero film in 2023. It certainly isn't one to rush out too but maybe down the line it could be worth a watch.Rating - 6/10.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

And, what's more, now Aquaman-2 is much better than the first. Equal measures of story, action and humor. The first part was great, but i was not sure if a sequel would hold much substance because Aquaman-1 already covered lot of the aqua world in a grand manner. So, when i walked into the theater, I hadn't got much expectations. But i should accept that the movie WOW'ed me. It got a slower beginning, and picks up steam gradually leading up to a satisfying ending. The quest by the antagonist in the beginning was good, only to be eclipsed by another quest by the protagonist in the middle portion of the movie. The brotherhood dynamics between Arthur and Orm was neatly presented. The way it turned up in the climax was admirable. Talking about climax, glad it was not too far-stretched as in Aquaman-1 though. CGI was stunning. It is as good as the first part, if not better. I don't know what is there to write anything negative about this movie. This is a movie with a good story, some epic actions and one or two twists here & there. A neat entertainer to be enjoyed with family, particularly children. Easily 8 stars all around.If you want to know my personal like/dislike references, i loved Aquaman-1, Justice League (except the climaxes in both), Infinity War, Thor Ragnarok, Black Panther, Spider Man No Way Home, Batman 2022 etc.Disliked Antman Quantumania, Thor Love & Thunder, Wakanda Forever, Far From Home, Batman V Superman etc.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

Aquaman has a good premise but mediocre story execution. Filmmakers are dependent too much on CGI instead of a good story. Example: Godzilla Minus One cost 15 million dollars, and has made almost $100 million because Toho Studios took the time to build the story up and craft the CGI to enhance the story. Aquaman didn't wear his famous outfit too much either. He was dressed more in street clothes as Arthur Curry rather than his suit; that's like you see Batman and he's dressed mainly as Bruce Wayne. You want to see Batman. Amber Heard was underutilized & wasted. Black Manta couldn't been more deadly. It was a mistake to cut: the superhero cameos.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Something about this movie didn't really have that spark compared to the first aqua-man movie. There were way too many one liner jokes that weren't really funny which ruin the moment. The cgi wasn't as good as the first movie as well and kind of became an eyesore. Believe me there were some parts of the movie that were really beautiful but most of the time the cgi didn't really hit. The side characters felt really bland and I wished they had more depth instead of just being there. The story also felt rushed as well which sucked.

But this second installment of Aquaman is definitely not redeeming. I found myself looking at my phone or getting up to use the bathroom just so I had something slightly more entertaining to do than sit through this boring and pointless film.The movie was so predictable that suspense was completely impossible. Every arc was crafted out of arcs we have seen in 1000 other movies. The fight scenes were ok. The acting overall was pretty mediocre but with characters that had no depth to begin with what can a great actor do?The best and most convincing acting was by the primary villain, Manta, played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. However his supporting cast of villains were gradiently worse. The scientist was good. But the lady who played his captain was really quite bad and unconvincing.My advice: wait for this to come out on streaming and have your phone handy so you can play a game while half paying attention to this film. So not worth it otherwise.","8 out of 14 found this helpful.

Seriously. Most IMDb users or critics like me are non-professionals. Just expressing our opinion about movies or tv series. But when it comes to comic book adaptation movies, I know what I'm talking about. This movie is way better than the that stupid Flash movie, Black Adam, Blue Beetle and especially Shazam 2! Even better than The Marvels and some previous movies from Marvel.It is a fun movie. Gentle comedy type. Not over-exaggerated funny like how Waititi did to Thor Ragnarok and Love & Thunder and that stupid Flash movie. It feels forced! But then again this is a superhero movie, it shouldn't be funny at all. Depending on the character, like Deadpool - he should be funny. Or like Spider-Man. Not every superhero movie should be funny. Period.I do not care if Amber Heard is still Mera, the story does not center at her. It's not boring from start to finish. It was engaging from the start. Zero dull moments. Less talking and direct to the plot. I hope James Wan directs all the upcoming DC movies coz he does do his homework.

One reason might be coz jason momoa through his dynamic debut in the dc franchise had marked an everlasting impression on the character.Similar to the first one, the visualisation & audio effects are truly magnificent. But, unlike the former whose title ought to be arthur vs orm, this latter one relies on the face-off between arthur & david. The once foe and now the nemesis of aquaman is the ever stronger black manta fuelled with orichalcum. Hence, follows a deadly combat between the two of them. Noteworthy to mention, that here orm turned over a new leaf and aided arthur for the noble cause.The story is as simple as the laminar flow of water. The first movie, though being a bit dull, was still able to create a charismatic effect. One of the main aspects of the previous movie was it's comedic elements which was thoroughly missing in this one. Well won't lie as this movie has some suspenseful moments but quickly afterwards it became stale.Jason momoa tried to become funny at times but seemed utterly buffoonish. It was particularly most disgusting when he compared cockroach with shrimp. Moreover, he made references from the marvel universe & harry Potter. I don't know why dc movies have become so wretched that they have to draw ideas from others for creating funny sequences. His chemistry with amber heard also doesn't seem much engaging. Patrick wilson seemed a bit more tolerating. He looked more sensible and less ruthless as he was in the first one. Abdul Mateen was almost in an extended cameo in the first film which doesn't affected much. But here almost the entire movie relied on his shoulders. Quite reasonably, he acted really hard to prove himself a bad guy. By firing cannon for two times on aquaman, he projected himself as the archenemy. But unfortunately, often his acting seemed a bit melodramatic or as he should have done to make it believable to be possessed by the monster kordax. Special mention requires for randall park for his chameleon type performance of Dr shin.Aquaman 2 can be attributed for it's highly distinguishable cgi. And the only reason for which it can be worth watching atleast once.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Yet it couldn't decide which subplots were rich enough to spend movie time on, so it scrambled them all.Not to mention the typical complaints: bad cgi, incoherences in the story and a certain marvelization of a topic that could have been unique, ending up with a predictaboe clich√©.","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

This thing is a mess from start to finish, it is bloated and makes no sense whatsoever.

Especially when you notice little details that are callbacks to the predecessor. Great story, jumping right into the important parts without any filler. Ties up looming questions from the first one, which is why it's a natural progression. Very glad that the men owned the action scenes & Mera the character is amazing solely because of her abilities. Full filling redemption story for Orm. Jason & Patrick really carry this film on their backs. Great chemistry between them along with character development.

Sure, it captured attention all the way through, but there were so many cringe moments I found myself constantly aware of ""bad writing syndrome"".First that comes to mind is that terrible accent of Aquaman's ""general"" (?). Guy sounds like he came straight outta Alabama. This is supposed to come from an ocean kingdom? Every time the guy spoke it was solid cringe.I can say that the first half or 2/3 of the film, the script lines weren't terrible. But then came that ""DC"" moment where it turned from a movie script into a comic book script written by fanboys. Ouch. These writers actually got paid for such drivel? And then there's that very last few lines of the movie, where they just can't resist portraying Aquaman as a country hick. Seriously DC, what is wrong with you?Something else that bothered me from early-on in the movie is the CGI overkill of the underwater Atlantis Kingdom. It is so alien in its appearance I found my brain having difficulty processing what I was seeing. It was all blue and green and white lights and incomprehensible shapes and (evidently) roads and travel tubes that were just so cobbled and thrown together it was hard to tell what was what.No matter how alien a civilization, the viewer still has to be able to recognize what is going on or we develop what's known as cognitive dissonance. This movie was full of that kind of stuff-- CGI so weird it was difficult to mentally fit the pieces together.I had some difficulty deciding whether to give this 3, 4 or 5 stars, but I figure they put enough effort in the thing to at least label it ""mediocre"". But long before the end of the movie it was pretty obvious that DC has blown it again. (Wow, the script in the final half hour or so. It was just awful.)","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

It felt like James Wan and the crew really knew they had nothing to offer so they just did not care at all about what was happening in the film. They just did whatever they wanted and it came out to be a rather hilarious spectacle to me.It's kind of hard to talk about the humongous stupidity in the movie without spoiling it but trust me when I say nothing feels like it's being taken seriously. The plot points all just feel thrown in from other things, the weirdest and most prevalent thing would be some things that feel directly from the World of Warcraft universe...???The acting and delivery made me laugh a lot. It was bad across the board, but I didn't think Jason Mamoa or Patrick Wilson were bad. They seemed like they were trying along with Nicole Kidman though she wasn't in the movie much. Amber Heard and Randall Park were both very 1 dimensional and were unbelievable in every single scene they were in. Manta was very over the top and often made me laugh when he was on screen. It was stupid. Dolph Lundgren was TERRIBLE, every line he delivered was as if he was an amateur they picked up off the street, it did not seem like he wanted to be there.The forced dramatic parts in this movie essentially border on parody. They did a low framerate slowdown during an incredibly overdramatic melodrama sequence that just came out of nowhere. It was very funny. I know a lot of people are having issues with this but given the tone of the entire movie (which was inconsistent by the way) it felt like a lot of this insanity was completely intentional. I'm not saying its not stupid, I'm saying I was busting up laughing in the theater.I liked some of the fight scenes to be honest. Barring the first one which was actually very bad, basically it felt like this blue cgi mess and was just all the same color pigment, so it was just very hard to keep track of anything that is happening. The desert fight was not bad, I enjoyed the choreography in that scene and thought that was probably the best scene in the movie. Though there was a comical scene in that fight scene involving Patrick Wilson that I just couldn't deal with, it was so funny to me.There were scenes in the movie that were intended to make you laugh that I like, actually intentionally unironically laughed at. I think they were a little low on the joke tierlist but this movie's jokes did tickle my fancy occasionally. I was definitely never bored watching this movie.Overall most of this movie just made me laugh because of how stupid it was all the time. It felt like a video game so often. It felt like nobody cared about the seriousness of what they were doing, and it just feels like watching a ridiculoustrainwreck and personally I'm all for it. I find it incredibly engaging. If something very stupid and over the top does not interest you, probably stay away from this movie, as it really does not offer much outside that element.Low 4/10 or High 3/10.PS. I know this may seem like a high score for how much I talked poorly about this film, but I again... I really cannot preface how much I had a great time watching this movie. I would much rather watch this DC film again over something like Wonderwoman 1984, The Marvels, Ant Man 3, Thor 2... ETC.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Did these 6 and lower scorers even watch the movie? I doubt it.The movie caught us up with what happened since the last movie, set-up the villain's quest/opportunity/plan very well. The first response by the heroes to the villains first attack lead smoothly into the next phase of the movie. The villain's motivations were comprehensible. The lead henchwoman role was well acted, you could see the glee she felt over the power she controlled, but it was not over the top.How could you not love this movie?

The story telling was fractured and lacked flow or continuity.

The characters are ugly, the depiction of underwater scenes is even uglier, the locations are horribly generic and the color palette is the stuff of nightmare. It seems that the production designer decided that the way to make this movie stand out would be by making every location look either moldy and rotten, like Central European cities in those parts where old cement has absorbed too much water and has moss growing all over it or variations of green, blue and red, like a Marvel poster for Avengers Endgame.The same horrible choices apply for the sky. No magic hour here, only cloudy skies that make half the movie look miserable. I cannot remember when it was the last time that I saw a movie where almost every shot was so horribly lit and so aesthetically displeasing that it convinced me to check the director's previous work to understand what the hell went so wrong.Ugliness aside, the script barely ever stands out, and apart from a couple scenes between Aquaman and his brother trading insults, literally all other dialogue is as generic as a Pepsi Ad.Overall, all the magic of the first movie has been replaced by triviality and mediocrities.The retro technology (robots, engines and big, ugly buttons everywhere) used by the villains is completely out of place. All in all, this movie equals to 2,5 hours of ugliness and boredom and cannot be recommended to anyone except Aquaman fans.Everyone else, including Jason Momoa fans, avoid like the plague.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

But unlike Shazam 2, Quantumania, and The Flash, Aquaman 2 dig even deeper into the mediocrity, and ends up even worse than than the aforementioned films. Whether the result of reshoots or a genuine lack of scriptwriting competence, hence why the delays of the film releases, the outcome is nonetheless marked by significant amounts of lazy exposition, a hilariously incoherent plot, and cringe-worthy dialogues, painfully delivered by whoever participated in this.If there's anything positive that is worth mentioned, I'd come up with Patrick Wilson and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. These two are probably the only actors who genuinely committed themselves to their roles in a serious manner. In the midst of this cinematic wreckage, they stand as the only legitimate sources of interest and charisma, delivering performances that are far more than anything this movie deserved. As for the others, I can't say much about them, other than that most of them are fed up with their presented material. And to be honest, I understand why.Overall, my enjoyment of this movie is unfortunately outweighed by my immense disappointment. It's really sad and disheartening that the creative minds behind this debacle abandoned any semblance of effort early in the production. In a proper conclusion, I'm at the point that I'm not enraged, but rather feel sorry of the miserable way to end this franchise.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

That's this movie. DC tries this way too often.I had to stop watching 5 times so far because it's that bad.The story is too fast. Too far silly. It tries way too hard.The first 10 minutes is mostly trying to have that, ""cool"" scene for everyone when they do something cool, dead center of the screen then the camera zooms in and they slowly look up....When I turned it back on later that week, they did it again and again. I had to turn it off again.I really wanted to give it a shot so I tried a few more times. Then I notice how much spoken exposition there was. Not only that, they thought that since Thor and Loki worked well together, they'd try it here. Once again, too fast and with little explanation. Then Aquaman suddenly acts completely different to be funny.They even copied Star Wars in a scene.OMG it's so bad. Marvel gets it even though they haven't been as good but they don't do the, ""cool"" shots so often it's that noticable.Basically, Marvel are the cool kids and DC is trying too hard that it makes it worse.Just write a good story to begin with, stress m insert superheroes, tweak it for superheroes and go. Don't try to have all those, ""cool"" shots.If you want to enjoy it, I'm sorry because now you may notice this crap more but it's terrible.At least Amber is barely in it since she's so unlikeable.I complained about The Marvels but that movie is good with a couple stupid scenes and characters they probably should've left for television. This is terrible in every way.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

With the bar set so low, it was relatively easy to watch this and enjoy it for what it was. The film was bad, but it still was a passable way to spend a few hours and see the collapse of Snyder's DC Universe through to its completion. The CGI is awful and they turned it into a buddy cop / brother romp, but considering I like Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson, it wasn't all that painful. The worst part of the whole movie was when they journeyed to the forbidden pirate land, er whatever that was supposed to be. It felt like they let George Lucas ghost write that portion and throw as many strange and goofy looking fish (aliens) as he could think of. They even had a terrible band singing a stupid song like the re-edit of Return of the Jedi. There was a sufficient amount of bad acting that you would expect from an effects driven movie with Dolph Lundgren and Amber Heard snatching the top prizes for worst performance. There were definitely some things about the Snyderverse that I enjoyed, but I'm glad it is finally running its course and am holding out hope that James Gunn will do something good with his reboot of the universe. Still very skeptical but one can dream.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Now, that I gave a few seconds of attention to that ""monumental"" event, we can move on to what's more important today...the movie.The first ""Aquaman"" movie at its best is an ""okay"" predictable CGI journey or briefly - B grade comic book movie.""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom""...oh boy, as if it wasn't enough that the studio had no faith in the movie and waited to lift the embargo for the reviews for the last possible moment. The movie is an underwater mess. It tries to be serious and funny and fails at both. The story is predictable from the tenth minute. Honestly the best thing I can say about the movie is Patrick Wilson's attempt to save it with his chemistry with Momoa's character and some good effects here and there.Black Manta had a few moments more screen time than the previous movie, but again I wouldn't say it was the villain it should have been and that has nothing to do with Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's acting skills, he is great.I'm not even gonna start with Amber Heard, you already know all you need to know.In the end, there is nothing memorable that we haven't already seen in the previous ""Aquaman"". In short, a completely forgettable superhero movie. I don't think it's worse than ""Wonder Woman 1984"", but it's certainly trying to take away that ""glorious"" title.I believe in James Gunn and I hope starting in 2025 we will see the beginning of a coherent and well interconnected universe at last. The DC fans and the characters of this universe deserve it.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

I think the film was made a little weaker when they introduced magic instead of sticking with the tech/superhero story.Overall the visuals were really good, the two brothers had decent chemistry, the jokes weren't too cringy, and Amber Heard only appeared when absolutely necessary.

I was bored well within the first half hour and I kept questioning how long I would stick this out.I'm not quick to give up on movies when I've committed to watching them. However, the more bored I get and the weaker the storyline, the more likely I am to browse social media or multi-task, which I ended up doing.I would have been pissed if I'd paid to watch this at the theater. I watched when it premiered on The Movie Network, only a couple of months after released in theaters.The storyline was lacking depth and much of the time it felt like a lot of disjointed/incohesive action and noise that didn't always make sense, like the action scenes were being used as a filler or to try to force things to be more exciting - especially in the first 45 minutes. It seemed like one rushed action scene after another, and it didn't make sense.I thought it was starting to get better at 50 minutes in, but that feeling didn't last long.The interaction between the two brothers was good though. They're both great actors, when given good scripts and storylines to work with. There were moments between them that were good, but they were always drowned out by the rest of the movie.Most of the actors and actresses in the movie are great (in general). The acting wasn't even close to the biggest problem with this movie. I think they did well with what they had to work with. The scene edits, cuts, re-shoots, etc. Didn't help in the least.The movie started to get more interesting 1 hour and 20 minutes in - when the story of The Lost Kingdom was being explained. Now all of the sudden it SEEMED like there was some meaningful storyline to grab onto that caused me to stop multi-tasking and pay attention. It was interesting. At least for a FEW minutes.But then the storyline got overtaken again by the overuse of meaningless, noisy action scenes that did nothing to enhance the movie and I ended up forgetting what the storyline was (again) and what they were supposed to be doing.I know it's an action movie, but for frig sakes, tone it down and make it meaningful in some way. The action scenes should strategically enhance the movie and add to the storyline, not detract from it. Make it matter and make it make sense.Did the producers and directors even bother to watch and review the final product to see what a mess this was?Wasn't there someone involved who could have stepped in to say, ""I know we've had countless delays, but this is pretty bad and we just can't release it like this."" I mean, it might have been better to just shelf it permanently and take the loss. I wouldn't want this in my portfolio or on my resume.Can't say I didn't give it a chance and watch it all the way through. I won't be watching it again though.My 3 stars may be too generous. I dedicate them to the cast and the few moments here and there where there seemed like hope for the storyline.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

I'm not kidding, there's like 30 seconds where it's actually Jason Momoa on a bike.Pacing and tone- its all over the place. Random music, sometimes it's orchestral, sometimes it's techno/edm and it doesn't even fit what's on the screen; same with none of it fits together or brings the movie together as a whole.The story is so derivative and predictable, they literally steal from Black Panther and Ironman.

Some of the effects also were just so phony looking and not on par with what I would expect. Worry about writing a good story and don't spend all your time looking for effects to do. So many actors that look like they are just getting paid was no care for the character or even making a good story. You have a scene that is a ripoff look of Jabba the hut which speaks to its originality. Let's make a genetically engineered squid. Yeah that will be brilliant. Just another bad DC movie pushing some global warming story with all kinds of cgi thinking that's good enough. We don't need the nonstop cgi action.

""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,"" however, feels like it strains under the weight of its ambitions.Jason Momoa's undeniable charisma is wasted on repetitive ""Stand and Model"" sequences that were a forgivable indulgence in the first film. Here, their absence, provides a glaring reminder of a weak script that struggles to juggle multiple antagonists and themes.Black Manta's return fails to capture the electric menace he possessed earlier. Even the talented Patrick Wilson can't elevate the underwhelming return of Orm. The attempt to weave climate change into the narrative feels clunky and unearned. Furthermore, the overuse of unconvincing CGI detracts from the attempts to add emotional weight to the story.Ultimately, ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom"" feels like a desperate attempt to replicate the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This focus on competition undermines what could have been a unique and entertaining superhero franchise.A Brighter Spot:Wonder Woman remains a shining example of the potential DC films hold. Hopefully, future installments will learn from this misstep and prioritize strong narratives over spectacle.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

His life as a father is also part of the plot with his family on his side and is a direct sequel to the first Aquaman film. The plot thickens when Black Manta and Jimmy Woo, I mean Dr Shin found the lost city of Necrus. With his plans to avenge his father and the powers of the black Trident, the Black Manta is set to destroy Aquaman and everything he holds dear.This time, Arthur is being aided by his brother Orm. I must say that their brotherly duo was the MVP of this film. Mera was sidelined but everything feels good. The film has the right amount of balancing the humor, action, drama and overall has a good story.If you enjoyed the first film, you'll enjoy this more. Watch it in IMAX for a better experience. The movie felt like Thor/Loki and at the same time Black Panther but this film is loads better than the last Thor film.So if you think superhero films are all bad these days, this film might just restore your faith.

The script-by-committee CGI silliness of the production is salvaged to some degree by the natural charisma of Jason Mamoa. His banter with estranged half-brother Patrick Wilson is the movie's highlight. In that regard Wilson sometimes comes across as a brilliant actor saddled with an impossible assignment and at other times like a hack going through the motions; since he's acknowledged as the former this seems to be an issue of direction and/or editing. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Nicole Kidman, and Dolph Lundgren all show up to do their diligence without much flair.

The follow-up, 'Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,' lacks the originality of the original and sinks due to its lack of a passable script.It's unfair to have expected this sequel to be anywhere close to its predecessor, but 'Kingdom' is painfully bad. The awkward duo of Jason Momoa as Arthur and Patrick Wilson as Orm just doesn't work in a comedic way, unlike the arch enemy way from the first installment. This dynamic really impacts the overall mood of the film and makes it feel like unserious in a 'Thor' kind of way. It just comes off as a totally different film than the previous one.There's also the small detail of Amber Heard reprising her role as Mera (couldn't they have written her out of this one), and Nicole Kidman probably could have skipped this one. The only actor who seemed to understand the assignment was Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, as he matches the ferocity that he brought to 'Aquaman' as the semi-scary Black Manta.If you're a ""DCEU completist"" and feel the need to watch this, be my guest. But if not, there's no real point to taking this journey under the sea.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It was obviously expensively made with practically every shot containing some kind of special visual feature and like before, I was impressed by the depiction of the deep blue sea and its myriad inhabitants. However I felt there were less of those type of shots this time, with a much greater concentration on action sequences and really once you've seen one crash-bang-wallop set-piece you've pretty much seen them all.In this one, Aquaman faces off against Black Manta, still carrying a grudge against the superhero for killing his dad last time out. The baddie then finds an enchanted trident which can unlock a phantom king of the past and thousands of his troops as exiled by the Sea King's father years before. To combat this imminent twin threat, Aquaman has to team up with his truculent younger brother Orm to save the seas and also seek to peacefully co-exist in the future with we land-lubbers above.Like its predecessor, the movie is played less than seriously with much attempted humour centring on the Sea King struggling to change his infant son's nappy and his initially testy partnership with his reluctant sibling, so much so, that after some time it seems as if he's trying to win the day by punning his opponents to death.While the camera set-ups often did look impressive, I didn't feel I saw anything in them I hadn't seen before last time out. Jason Momoa, for a big guy, I have to say, demonstrates considerable agility in the title part.Otherwise I have to report that the film rather washed over me like the sea on the sand, leaving no discernible traces afterwards.I thought it was interesting that there was no teaser trailer for a further sequel over the end titles which makes me wonder just how well the previews went. I personally think that expensive spectacles like this are on the way out and wonder how Hollywood will move on from here. It just seems like I'm watching the same comic-based movie every time, whether it be about a DC or Marvel characterNow there is a task for a budding superhero or two...","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It needed a story to tell, logical action sequences and more character buildup, rather than what I have seen.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Jason Mamoa?!? Amazing in got! He is not Aquaman! The marvel movie line up cast the parts. The DC movie line up chose short term (and short sighted) pandering to pick poorly suited actors and missed the mark blindly. The EP's should've been let go after choosing Mamoa, but they doubled down on horrible casting with the flash. Cyborg was a good choice, and wonder woman was amazing, but 2.5 out of 6 bad choices left me feeling cheated. Marvel worked because other than Fury, the comics built the character, choosing legacy over improvised reboot . DC decided to choose actors with no similarity to the original comics. Why?! If you want to build a legacy of film, follow the rules! Clever plot, specific character choices complementing the originals, and action. The Christian Bale / Heath Ledger period of Batman could have spawned a dynasty of great DC film making. I'm sorry to say I'm now just disappointed

This actor never ceases to amaze with his charismatic and tough character who must deal with his task as king of Atlantis until Black Manta returns. Making a sequel to the film released in 2018 was necessary to continue Black Manta's revenge story. This antagonist manages to have the participation that he needed in this universe. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is a nearly unknown actor, but his performance as Black Manta is the best of his early career. The return of Orm Marius, played by Patrick Wilson, was obvious because of how essential he has become since the first film. Nereus, played by Dolph Lundgren, has more interpretation and as for Mera, it is not strange that he no longer has as much relevance as in the first film after the affair with Amber Heard. Too bad that didn't allow Mera to have participated more as Aquaman's right-hand woman. The film offers excellent action scenes and the digital effects have a whole series of fascinating moments. In some ways, the film is strongly inspired by works by Jules Verne, H. G. Wells and H. P. Lovecraft. The machinery used by Black Manta's henchmen has a steampunk style that is reminiscent of The War Of The Worlds and 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. Even the costumes of Black Manta and his henchmen also have an air of Verne's works. The island where they hide and their creatures are clearly inspired by The Mysterious Island. The sea creatures or monstrosities of The Lost Kingdom have an air that resembles Lovecraft's mythology, probably being influenced by Call Of Cthulu, Dagon or The Shadow Over Innsmouth. The black trident, its power and the visions it provokes also have a Lovecraftian feel that could perhaps be something out of The Dunwich Horror. All these details make this film a wonderful adventure and fantasy story, just like the works it was inspired by. It has a good soundtrack by Rupert Gregson-Williams, with the Black Manta moments being the best of the entire score. Aquaman And The Lost Kingdom is one of the best films in the DC universe and it is a shame that it is the final chapter of this universe, because it undoubtedly shows that there is more potential in this franchise that could have been exploited. My final rating for this movie is a 10/10.","47 out of 225 found this helpful.

And ""Luke Aquaman Fishtalker"" trying to make a deal.There were so many similarities to other Disney and Lucas Arts films that the whole movie just had a De'javu feeling.

Characters are visible older than they were in the previous movies that take place after this?? I can't honestly tell anymore. Zack Snyder's version of Justice League should have put DC on top of the ""Comic superhero movies"" but sadly DC keeps going back to writers and Directors who have never actually read an action comic in their life.I lived through it after a couple beer, but it is at almost the bottom of my list for action/DC/Marvel movies.

I don't understand how she agreed to be in the second movie either - must have been trapped in a contract. Terrible writing and predictable everything with lots of corny bad lines and lessons strewn throughout. The use of dramatic music was just dumb and got annoying. If you're older than 13 years old this will just bore you and that's being generous.Really wanted to like this film but DC just doesn't know how to make a good movie. If you're just curious to see how bad an action movie can be pick any DC film that exists today and see for yourself.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Frankly, if I hadn't seen the latest Flash movie, I'd have given this a significantly lower review. The story wasn't just on crutches from the start, it abandoned one crutch for another as it went along, as if the writers knew none of them would stand for long.Definitely not Momoa's best outing, even within his limits.Now I need characters that matter to reach six hundred. This movie needs more characters that matter, and actors and writing which make me believe they do, so I'll keep writing words until this review is accepted, or DC gets back to providing quality, whichever comes first.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The movie is watchable....but barely.The villain is what makes this movie even worse. Black Manta is a joke from his backstory all the way down to the ridiculous bug-looking costume. I dont understand why he has to be the main villain instead of Kordax. Perhaps the film would have been a bit better with a much better villain. The Kordax backstory is much better than Black Manta. Kordax also looks more like a villain. I'm not surprised at all that this movie wasnt on the same level as the first. Then again, I was never really into Aquaman, as a character, to begin with.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Even the environmental subject isn't as aggressively promoted as some critics said. It's endlessly amazing to me how people who liked the first film can criticize this one.

That being said, sequels are rarely if ever as good as the original & this sequel doesn't change that trend sadly.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I thought the first one was bad in that department, but it has nothing on the sequel.Patrick Wilson is the only actor that is actually okay. Everyone else, and especially Jason Momoa are just bad. The dialogue is seriously some of the worst I've heard in awhile.My desire to watch this film was so thin, but I'm a completionist and felt obligated for some stupid reason and I hate myself for it.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Without pain or glory. Aquaman 2 is just another superhero movie, with the same formula as the rest of its peers, the same formula that ended up exhausting the goose that laid the golden eggs. Superman Legacy must be different to separate itself and shake itself from the entire group of films that could not give DC Films cohesion.Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom feels boring, repetitive, improvised, clumsy, without chemistry or substance. There is an excess of GCI that exhausts anyone. The virtual doubles of the characters are never convincing and the underwater dialogues are disastrous. The villain's motivations are baseless and simplistic. In general, none of the characters find their own development. They are all flat, without spark or grace.There are some shots that stand out and there is some daring directing work, but beyond that, there is not much to highlight.Aquaman 2 is as unnecessary as Blue Beetle was, but more boring, more tedious and with humor that never lands well. The action sequences are minimally entertaining, but they are recycled scenes. Recycled choreographies. Recycled ideas.I wouldn't recommend a movie as unnecessary as this one.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It was fun while having a sense of discovery and even gravitas. This sequel is still fun. The action sequences are fast-paced and creative and the world building of the undersea world and an isolated jungle island was colorful and full of fantastic creatures. But the plot here sort of drags and takes a turn towards the dramatic that does not completely follow from the fun and comedy of the first half of the movie. Jason Momoa holds the screen with his presence but mugs a bit too much for the camera with the endless jokes, some better than others. There's no stakes to the drama with the endless winks and nudges. Patrick Wilson looks like he wants to be in another film, like he can't decide whether to commit to the comedic tone or to keep the serious, vengeful nature of his character. Yahya Abdul-Mateen is strong as Black Manta by keeping a consistent serious tone to his character so I felt his sense of resentment and, in his own mind, justice. There is so much CGI that this is essentially an animated film and not all of it is convincing. I see this movie as a fun but inconsequential cartoon.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Mera is in the movie, but at the same time, she is not. Amber Heard is a beautiful woman. Every time I saw her, the events that happened came to mind and I laughed involuntarily. The visual effects of the movie were bad. Although I liked the action scenes of the movie, the visual effects were not good.

The sequel is a giant mess of noise and color that doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but some individual pieces are lightly amusing. It's not quite the complete dredge that was the first film's road picture that never worked on any level. This is more like five different movies in one, none of which work, but there are some small moments here and there. Bleh. It's still crap, though.So, Arthur Curry (Jason Momoa) is the Aquaman, and he spends half his time on land with his very small child with Mera (Amber Heard) with his father Thomas (Temuera Morrison) taking care of the baby whenever he has to go into the oceans and be all king of the Oceans and stuff. Like, oh my gosh. Did you know that being king isn't about being awesome but politics? Jeez, how awful for him. Well, at least he throws himself in gladiator rings with giant sea monsters to relieve his stress sometimes. Meanwhile, Black Manta (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is still really angry at Aquaman for killing his father in the first act of the first film, and he comes across the Black Trident that possesses him with an ancient sea green king with dreams of destroying the world while giving Black Manta the means for taking vengeance upon Aquaman.There really is no center to this story. It is just an excuse for very expensive special effects to flash on the screen very quickly while Momoa quips and Abdul-Mateen scowls. Black Manta attacks Atlantis, causing a bunch of damage, Aquaman decides to go look for his younger brother, Orm (Patrick Wilson) out of prison on his own by going undercover with a squid as backup. They have to go and try to figure out what Black Manta wants (revenge/end of the world) while expensive special effects surround them (gosh, the hair underwater ALWAYS looks terrible).I think where I have the most (it's a low bar) fun in the film is the buddy-travelogue nature between Aquaman and Orm. They have decent chemistry and work well with each other. It's amusing, slightly. Randall Park also has a smallish part as an employee of Black Manta where he has little more to do than try to act funny in between moments where he explains obvious things to the plot.The back half of the film is an extended action sequence where the two sides come to blows in epic, messy, special effects fashion, predicated on Black Manta needing royal Atlantean blood for some kind of sacrifice to awaken the ancient king, kidnapping the Aquaman baby to get it done. The film's lack of center, though, comes to play here where the film isn't about anything at all. It's just a series of events. I thought for a while that the end result was going to be Curry giving up the throne to his brother because Curry hates being king so much. And yet, it never even comes close to fulfilling that promise. The movie is so dumb that it looks at Curry hating being king, only needing constant action, and ends up with him still being king.Oh, it doesn't actually end with that. It ends with climate change is bad, which is...okay. There are some random lines of dialogue about Black Manta's plan releasing more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, but it's so disassociated from Aquaman's personal journey of...learning that being king can be awesome if he has an enemy and can go to war? This movie is a mess, and it really wouldn't surprise me if it was victim to the rumored series of reshoots.So, it has a few amusing little pieces, but the whole is a hodgepodge of half-cooked ideas that get abandoned, discarded, and ignored for long stretches, if not completely after they're introduced. The special effects sure do look expensive, just like in the first film, but they're also a mess without any real sense of beauty or aesthetics. It's just busy and fast, but Warner Bros. Sure did spend a whole lot of money on it. We can see it on screen!So, I'd say it's an improvement over the first, but it's still kind of just terrible. It's not much of an improvement, is what I'm saying.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Narration says humans and Atlanteans are working together to solve any climate crisis. Not that I'm big into all that stuff, however, the idea of it was a positive theme that I was happy to see.The movie and actors seem very vulnerable in a lot of their performances with these portrayals of these characters with family members being endangered and the emotions that would come with that. Sometimes it makes for a remarkable scene you've never seen before and others it makes for one in which can be ""cringe worthy."" I hate that word, but that's exactly how I felt haha.Still, I've never seen anything like this and as someone who's read a LOT of the aquaman comics I love this portrayal of these characters. They very loosly adapted the drowned earth story and I think it was told even better than in the comic which had way too much stuff going on.The first movie was an adaptation of a New 52 Aquaman story. They have an animated version of that comic called Throne of Atlantis. The Justice League is there in both of those stories but obviously they aren't going to be in the live action. I recommend that movie for sure!Taking this movie for what it is it's unique and I'm so happy it exists. Definitely original too!

Whatever they said they did the massive reshoots and you can see the obviouse difference in tone, going from serious to painfully not funny and mostly annoying parts. Even actors look different specificaly Patric who in some scenes have 6 pack, but in other scenes little belly or perfect hair but in other scences something like bad wig. James G. Uterlly destroyed this move and on purpose. Of course CGI is way wors then in the first movie and just entire story doesnt make sense as it was cut extensivelly.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

And nothing has made me stay up and watch it all the way through in 1 sitting. Like I said I'm halfway through and it's easy to rate and review this cause I know it won't get any better.I decided to look up last night if there were any rhymes or reasons why Mera was removed from the entire movie basically. And nothing besides ""bad chemistry"" with her and momoa. Maybe but I guarantee the depp/heard trial and how she's a wacko made the decision to remove scenes. And it's so noticeable. The dialog is so bad. Zero chemistry. Aquaman is basically a single dad except they are still married (he even says ""my wife"" to black manta) yet you never see her. Just bizarre. Also, we get a Nicole Kidman spotting. Barely. Another character gone so far. If I had to guess she was in scenes with heard so those had to be cut too. Momoa is apparently living with dad half the time with his kid, but Mera and Kidman are nowhere to be found? What?Speaking of manta, what in the world man. He's got an entire crew somehow and then I guess we get a flash forward a month after touching the trident and he's possessed by the ancient villain? And he found a bunch of ""ancient"" stuff that still works without issue? Idk it's all bad.Graphics are all cgi. We get a Star Wars cantina/jabba scene with aquaman and bro. Why? So bad.But seriously the worst thing is the dialogue. It is non-existent and cringe for the first 30. You can tell Mera scenes were cut or re-shot poorly or something. It deserves a 1 but since the action is decent and momoa and his cringe but acceptable jokes are around, a 3 is ok.EDIT! Another star is lost! Sad. Not. Mera and Kidman make an appearance when their child/grandbaby, who was forgotten after the first 15 minutes, makes an appearance 1hr 30 min in. Oh no they say as Superdad aquaman is the first inside followed by grandma then mom. Then, we see grandpa getting coddled by grandma, even though we haven't seen the two of them together all movie. I could go on but I won't. Pure trash. Watch if for yourself and prove me wrong.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Of course, it wasn't perfect, yeah, it was very far from perfect, but it's a fair enough new installment for a superhero movie scale and was definitely better than Blue Beetle, that came a few months before. The story doesn't feel that original, yet it was more developed than the first film and we got a proper villain this time. His main target is Aquaman, and of course, Aquaman has too stop him to make sure he doesn't mess up more things in the world. Aquaman is now the king of Atlantis, and once again performed by Jason Momoa, and I can't say he was that bad. I noticed a big change, though, and that was his personality. In the first film, Aquaman had the humor, but in here he was like totally chill, and sometimes a little naughty behavior, something he didn't have too much in the first film. That big change was very noticeable, but I think it was just for the better. The action goes ok, many moments felt lame and wasn't that good, while other had the action and the epicness it needed. The camera filming was good, I liked the close-up views, but I wished a better music score, that felt unoriginal like in the first movie. It could be written by Ai, who knows, Ai for music exist, I think. The visuals were weak, except of the kingdom of Atlantis, that was made very cool with nice cool colors and forms. The powers and super skill visuals were bad, and that was mostly what took the cool part of the action scenes. Some humor was nice, some of the jokes didn't fall good, and others did. I liked the ending, the moral part came, and I liked the ""I am Aquaman"" part better than in the first movie. The ending credits were cool, too, with great editing and song. They tried to push a moral about climate and global heating, what is a nice thing, yet it felt too pushed into the story, and I don't think it was that necessary, but of course, it is an important topic to talk about. You know, in the end, Aquaman 2 was average, it could be much, much better, but it should entertain you enough, and I think I liked it better than the first.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Not sure why since, statistically, the DC films on the whole are better than the majority of the Marvel movies. This, unfortunately, isn't a good example of that opinion.Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is, unbelievably, an improvement over its original film. NOT by much, and it's still really bad. It's basically a five-part Saturday Morning cartoon miniseries only live-action. And by ""live-action,"" I mean some of the faces and bodies looked real.Instead of joining forces with, I dunno, Superman, Wonder Woman or even Batman, Aquaman turns to his ""last chance,"" his incarcerated, criminal brother to help find/defeat part one's foe once again. Meanwhile, let's learn what it's like to be a Daddy.Heard this story before? Oh, yeah, Thor did it several times. Heck, they even acknowledged it. My suspicion is the normally more respected director James Wan threw that in because even he was embarrassed by this mediocre superhero adventure.To be fair, it's harmless and not the worst I've seen. I've actually watched many more MCU movies I hated more than this. It's just a chore to get through and helped me realize why us humans sincerely do have Superhero fatigue.At least the mid-credit scene didn't sadly promise more from the DCEU.***Final Thoughts: In truth, I didn't want to see this.

The music-video-like end-credits and jokey Marvel-esque cameo are actually pretty good (but too little, too late).I liked Patrick Wilson's amoral-brother story arc here; it's shallow and feels a bit ""Loki"", but it's still fun.Amber Heard's screen-time is severely minimized; what shall we make of that, eh?I give this four (4) stars.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom: A Sinking Ship of Cinematic Garbage! - The Worst Superhero Adaptation in 15 Years!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9723350/?ref_=tt_urv","fadybaseleem","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur132504173/?ref_=tt_urv","7 April 2024","Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom tries so hard to be the hero in a sea of superhero movies that it ends up drowning in a pool of mediocrity. This sequel, just like its predecessor, has an identity crisis bigger than Atlantis itself, resulting in a messy mishmash of borrowed ideas from every film under the sun.Oh, let's take a delightful tour of cinematic references, shall we? It's like a buffet of stolen scenes from Indiana Jones, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, War of the Worlds, The Matrix Revolutions, and Ridley Scott's Aliens. They clearly couldn't pick just one theme, so they decided to throw them all in and hope for the best. Spoiler alert: it didn't work.The first act is a torturous journey through a faux documentary, complete with a half-hearted attempt at Ridley Scott's Alien. But hey, newsflash, folks! This ain't Alien, not even close. It's more like a cheap knockoff that overstays its welcome. Talk about a dumpster fire of epic proportions.And let's not forget about the oh-so-memorable cast of characters. Just kidding! They're forgettable, especially the villains. Their motivations are weaker than a soggy sea cucumber, failing to give any oomph to the story. The main villain? Utter disappointment. They exist solely for the sake of this lackluster movie. Bravo, guys.But wait, there's more! The grand finale, the climactic battle that we've all been waiting for. And boy, does it deliver... disappointment on a silver platter. It's like the filmmakers suddenly remembered they had to wrap things up and decided to throw something together in five minutes. Bravo once again, for ruining the entire movie in one fell swoop.But hey, there's a silver lining! The movie wants you to believe that the bond between Aquaman and his brother is the heartwarming message you've been craving. It's a beautiful sentiment, really, if only it could save this sinking ship of a film from its own incompetence.In the end, Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is a desperate attempt to entertain the younger audience who just want flashy sea creatures and mindless action. This is, without a doubt, the worst and poorest superhero/comic book adaptation I have seen in the last 15 years! The movie sucks! So, dear viewers and moviegoers, do yourselves a favor and avoid this piece of cinematic garbage. Trust me, it's a colossal waste of time and money.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I loved the way he output the action sequences in the first one and this one's just as, if not even more artsy! The attention to detail is amazing. (Some action sequences are nowadays hard to follow as they try to pack them too much - well these are packed but somehow still able to be followed). Hard to imagine how to create a belieavable under water environment but he somehow did this and it feels like you are underwater and it was great to see the extension of the story!! Please make a 3rd!!!Jason Momoa is awesome and loved his expansion of his character - brilliant delivery with the right amount of seriousness and funny when it called for it!Loved the storyline too, interesting concept that balances well against the first movie - maintains a good deal of mystery but nicely ties with the first! Loved it.","11 out of 46 found this helpful.

It's just insane how I think this movie isn't absolutely horrible, but also, it's just kind of boring. This movie uses every cliche that you can think of. I also have a lot of problems with the pacing, because I see how they had a bunch of ideas, but literally none of them get used and the emotional moments aren't very emotional, because the movie moves at extreme breakneck speeds (in the last third at least). This movie isn't even about ""The Lost Kingdom"" for the most part. I just feel like all the big stakes from the first movie got removed, because the main villain of the first movie just isn't evil anymore. But I kind of respect the movie for having that idea, even tho it wasn't even developed that well.The CGI compared to the Flash still has that uncanny movement that's pretty weird, but it looks much more natural, because it's underwater, and honestly the movie doesn't look bad and it's pleasant for the most part. But yeah, DCEU ends on the greatest post credit scene of all time. Must watch (the post credit scene)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The first Aquaman might be the best looking movie ever made and the second one does not drop the ball in the visuals. The fight scenes are still thrilling and the criminally underrated Rupert Gregson Williams goes hard on the soundtrack. I went into the movie with no expectations regarding the Story and I was pleasantly suprised by the heartfelt tale of two brothers, a Story I could deeply empathize with. Also Aquaman as played by Jason Momoa might be the most entertaining Superhero ever put on the big screen. Go watch it on the biggest screen possible.","6 out of 21 found this helpful.

This helps with attention span and overall grasp of the task at hand. It is made clear the movie is DC, but that no justice league involvemenrt is necessary although great matters are at stake. The resanating issues of the king show through the civilization as he corrects it through the movie helping distance both himself and his kingdom from the present.

Starting with the not so subtle iconic bar scene from Star Wars. Not just that, they included music from the sixties and seventies among others. I'm old (just shy of 77 and my daughter is 50) so we noticed. There were bits of comedy, always great when people that make movies do not take themselves too seriously. Lets ""complain"" about a not huge turn out when it was released in December 22, when people are doing last minute traveling to see family, shopping and preparing for Christmas. Let me say it again, great special effects. Add to that two main actors that I am fan of. Only thing, Atlantis was a bit more east of the US than in the final scene.

While I enjoy superhero films with their surrealism, melodrama, and comedy, the Aquaman franchise is flatlining with a terrible sequel directed by James Wan, reportedly the final film in the DC Extended Universe. The Aquaman franchise is floating through the dreary depths, like a discarded plastic bag that will choke the last remaining vaquita porpoise. While I enjoy superhero films with their surrealism, melodrama, and comedy, the Aquaman franchise is flatlining and unable to compete with other films. Jason Momoa returns with his self-admiring Aquaman, a comic-lite version of Thor. Aquaman is a cheerful alpha-superhero with a laid-back home life, often spending time with his father Tom and drinking beer. He now controls Atlantis and has imprisoned his half-brother Orm. Patrick Wilson reprises his role with a icy dignity. The queen of Atlantis is Mera, played by Amber Heard. Dolph Lundgren plays Nereus, Aquaman's father-in-law. Willem Dafoe doesn't appear, but Nicole Kidman plays Aquaman's willowy and distraite mother Atlanna. Willem Dafoe's self-respect is absent in the last film, but Nicole Kidman returns as Atlanna. Aquaman has become a dad, showcasing his love for his baby, Momoa. This change in character is a departure from the Hollywood trope of the tough guy wearing a baby papoose. Aquaman faces the second villain from the previous film, Black Manta, played by Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. Black Manta has a bullied marine biologist named Dr Shin, played by Randall Park. The confrontation may involve a rapprochement between Aquaman and his troubled semi-sibling Orm. Despite the long-lasting 124-minute film, both the film and audience are deeply immersed in something else, not seawater. ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom"" follows Arthur, now the king of Atlantis, as he navigates his newfound power and the challenges of leading the Atlantis high council. The film is less lyrical and wonderstruck, with a more battle-ready tone than the previous installment. Arthur and his comrades must journey to corrupt kingdoms and dingy mines to defeat his nemesis, David Kane, also known as Black Manta. The film features a grand scale staged by returning director James Wan, but also has a glumly standard feel. The main focus is on fighting, face-to-face, spear-to-spindly CGI monster, and trident-to-trident. The 3D technology does not heighten the action, but the real answer is that nothing could heighten it. The film is staged on an impressively grand scale, but also has a glumly standard feel.Aquaman, introduced in 1941, is not the first superhero of the comic-book-movie era to be a long-haired counterculture demigod, but Jason Momoa made him the first to be a bro. Arthur's main task is to form a bond with Orm, the Loki-like half-brother who despises him out of jealousy. They are united by having the same enemy, and the film spends the core of the film bantering on dry land. The casting of Jason Momoa as Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is less willowy and mysterious than in the first film. Martin Short as Kingfish and Willem Dafoe's Vulko are also missing. The MCU has already registered as the year when the MCU stumbled and may begin its slow fall from cultural dominance. In ""Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom,"" the talk about the alliance of the seven kingdoms, the ominous figure of Kordax, and the malignant lost kingdom of Necrus wears down the audience. The stakes are high, yet not worth holding your breath over. The film's numbing repetition of comic-book movies and the ominous figure of Kordax and Necrus make it difficult to enjoy the story.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The story, performances of the cast, action sequences, direction, screenplay, soundtrack, visual and sound effects, themes, cinematography, comedic moments, emotional weight, and the movie's ending were excellent and have nothing to be said against them.Regarding the flaws, from my point of view, I found two flaws in the movie, the way it ended and the mid credits scene. Regarding the first flaw, as being the final film in the DCEU, the movie didn't give a good ending to this universe because it didn't actually finish any story of the DCEU superheroes, and regarding the second flaw, the scene didn't have any deep meaning in it. It was put just for comedy.But these two flaws won't prevent me from giving a good score to Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom because I enjoyed it so much and didn't expect it to be of that level. That is why when it comes to the score, I gladly give Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom 9 out of 10.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

After being defeated by Aquaman, Black Manta(Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is out for revenge. Black Manta is much more powerful this time around, with the help of the mysterious Black Trident. Aquaman will have to take the help of his half-brother Orm(Patrick Wilson). Aquaman & Orm will have to put their differences aside & team up to protect the world from Black Manta & his malevolent plan.Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is a superb film. Director James Wan has given us a movie that falls short of Aquaman(2018) but, still has the ingredients that made it a hit. The action set pieces are fantastic. The visual effects are great. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. Jason Momoa is awesome as Arthur Curry/Aquaman. Patrick Wilson is spectacular as King Orm/Ocean Master. The camaraderie & banter between Momoa & Wilson's characters, is the highlight of the film. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II is brilliant as Black Manta. Amber Heard is effective as Mera. Nicole Kidman is outstanding as Atlanna. Randall Park is excellent as Dr. Stephen Shin. Temuera Morrison is perfect as Tom Curry. The supporting cast is impressive. Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is worth a watch. Doesn't deserve the extremely negative reviews. Lower your expectations & you just might like it.","5 out of 23 found this helpful.

I was laser focus on the plot, having quality family bonding, challenges of anyone and value of forgiveness, care and trust, are some of the traits they injected in the movie, that will make you feel good after seeing it! Sounds cheesy or not, it's patterned to our reality that makes more sense and tries to connect as much as possible given the fact that it's another super hero flick! Go see it, have an open mind and just enjoy the ride!","4 out of 17 found this helpful.

The effects are really good, which you would expect from a fiction movie, it isn't the greatest movie of all time and the first one was better but it didn't disappoint.I guess there is only so much unique you can do now and maybe the writers have ran out of ideas.The recommendation is to go and watch this movie and take it with a pinch of salt, it is an entertaining film not a master movie, but it serves it's purpose.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

The plot may not be as strong as the first which now follows a black trident that possesses whoever holds it. Which Black Manta has it. And is bent on causing destruction with global warming that will affect the land and sea. While Aquaman is now needing his brother Orm to help out. It was fun to see Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson team up on a adventure while they try to settle there differences. It has a bit of humor. The rest of the characters like Nicole Kidman and Amber Heard also sit more in the sidelines this time around. While the film focuses on the two brothers trying to stop Manta.The action sequences are plenty and throughout. The visual effects are great. The music score is also good. The climatic battle may be shorter and smaller compared to the first. It does build the world of the lost kingdom and its undead army that they battle against.The cast ensemble did good. This may be the last DCU film while they are rebooting it. It is sad to say the world building is being cut off to where they can go. It is still an exciting action film to enjoy.","4 out of 24 found this helpful.

I find it about as good as the first. I do like it more than other people do, and even if I find something good, I'm aware there there could be flaws. I find this movie do some things a little too quickly at times and it'll be better if there's a half hour added to it.I find the action good and is on par with the first one. At times I feel it is like the visuals of the two James Cameron Avatar movies.I find the movie is like Black Panther. Aquaman and Atlantis talked about sharing their technology with the human world, just like Black Panther and Wakanda with the rest of the MCU's Earth.I feel like it could get a sequel if James Gunn feels like it. I heard Jason Momoa would like to complete the trilogy. I like stuff to become trilogies if talking about anything getting a sequel.Overall, I find Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom good but could still be better, and could get a sequel down the line if James Gunn feels like it. It's between it and Shazam! 2 for my favorite DC movie to come out of 2023.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The plot is well-paced, with enough twists and turns to keep even the most discerning viewer entertained. The action scenes are thrilling, with plenty of explosions and underwater battles.I don't understand why this movie has received negative reviews.

Even if you're not a fan of superheroes, you'll be captivated by the stunning visuals and the rich story. I give this movie a 10/10 and can't wait to see it a 3rd season!","3 out of 18 found this helpful.

And whilst looking for it he finds a trident that possesses him with an ancient evil spirit when he touches it. This ancient spirit not only makes him get revenge but also try to destroy the planet. And for some strange reason Aquaman (Jason Momoa) decides that the only person who can help him stop Black Mantha is his brother (Ocean Master - Patrick Wilson.)
Even though I didn't fully understand the reason why Aquaman had to free his brother from prison, I did enjoy the prison escape scene because it involved Aquaman and his brother getting chased by the monsters who guard the prison. I think it's this intense chase and another scene later on where Aquaman and his brother are getting chased by giant bugs in a forest that really make this film a good watch.There are also some goodish laser battles which I enjoyed but I was let down when Aquaman, his brother and his wife (Mera - Amber Heard) all seem to recover really quickly from their injuries.

Unfortunately Aquaman 2 has to bear the burden of having to follow through the recent flops and/or mixed bag of superhero output from both MCU/DCEU.James Wan doesn't offer anything new under sky; a baddie who wants revenge - saw that in the Marvels. Sibling tension? Saw that in Thor. Supposedly all powerful, final-baddie who then gets thumped easily? Saw that in Black Adam. By now, there's such an air of familiarity in superhero fares, that I think it' gonna take a complete shift in narrative/plots to offer audiences a fresh take.Jason Momoa's charisma and screen presence is basically the backbone of the movie and it pretty much carries it through. His timing, especially humour, is spot on, while his Aquaman is also convincingly authoritative. Yahya Abdul-Mateen II's somewhat wasted here. A capable actor, but he's reduced to portraying a stock baddie out for revenge, while his right arm, Stingray, is as one dimensional as they come. Plus it doesn't help that the actress who plays Stingray is kinda cardboard too.I find Randall Park, while dependable, nevertheless still plays Randall Park from other movies/Tv shows. You've seen his character in Blockbuster, or in the mcu outfits.Don't have any complaints on Amber Heard or Nicole Kidman, but they don't have enough screen time to make much of an impact. But I have to admit, I did wonder, what if Nicole played Capt. Marvel instead of Brie? I think I would have bought into it a lot faster. Kidman's talent is such that, even small screen time doesn't stop her from exuding enough screen presence to make her contribution count.Which leaves me with Patrick Wilson. His portrayal of Orm is brilliant, suffusing the character with the tension his inner conflicts have with his motives - ""do I live in hate, or do I forgive?"" The fact that Wilson achieves this without any acting histrionics but leaves his angst just right above the surface, just enough for us to feel it, is probably the standout feature of Aquaman and Lost Kingdom. I think he kinda redeemed himself from the poor and dumb Moonfall.I hope James Gunn will be able to create not only a new trajectory for DCEU, but an entire different take on superhero movies. While Aquaman 2 is entertaining enough to fill your 2h, it's also a by the numbers' effort. Not something you and I will live to remember.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But when I see the second movie, it kinda brought a little different from the first movie. It had a little bad writing and gone a little direction.Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson both did a really good job with there performances with all there bromance vibes, and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, did a brilliant job as Black Manta with his best super villain moments, because the story was pretty cool and also brings out some DC cinematic moments.From Director James Wan, is at his best with his filmmaking ideas he had for his own vision for Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom. He has view ideas, but I'm afraid for WB for DC, I'm afraid it's not enough to bring some of the audience to the Big Screen, like the first film did.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

FUN.It has some tired beats and structure, but hell, it is enjoyable and me and the wife had a pretty good time watching it.The family dynamics are fun, the sci-fi is cool, even if cookie cutter for the most part.Even when the villain is not that interesting, it's not the focus of the movie. And it's so ok.Even with all the controversy around it you can tell that when filming it, the actors were having a great time. Momoa steals the show as always.It has some serious Thor: Ragnarok vibes and you know what? That's just fine.Watch it. It's not groundbreaking or earth shattering. It's just fun. And that's ok.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's a tough job because at one point, they must've had fun watching movies. But now, it's just a job. I'm not saying they need to love every movie, but they seem to use the same criteria to review every movie and that's not the way to do it. At least for me. To each their own. But Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is a blast. Momoa and Wilson have fantastic chemistry. I know it's not one of the best comic book stories but it's average enough that the other pieces make this an enjoyable 2 hours. It makes me sad that this is the last time we see Momoa's Arthur Curry.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"","","Sequel, not as entertaining as the first one with Momoa.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9746691/?ref_=tt_urv","TxMike","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0438066/?ref_=tt_urv","20 April 2024","Of the 2018 ""Aquaman"" movie I wrote, ""This is a good popcorn movie, but I watched it at home on BluRay from my public library. It has a lot of very deep bass in many scenes and often rattled the glass doors covering the fireplace."" And further, ""The computer graphics and special effects are really great, but for my tastes there is just too much frantic battles and destruction in the scenes leading up to the conclusion.""And I can pretty well say the same for this movie. Right now its IMDb rating is about a point lower than the 2018 movie and that seems appropriate.The actors in various roles are pretty much the same. In this one Aquaman and his half-brother Orm must cooperate to defeat a menace who has a Black Trident which gives the bearer similar powers to Aquaman's Trident.I don't consider it to be a very good movie, however it is suitably entertaining if you don't expect too much.My wife skipped, not her kind of movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
