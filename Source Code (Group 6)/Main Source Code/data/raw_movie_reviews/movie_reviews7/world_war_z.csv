This one intrigued me because it was written by Mel Brooks' son, Max; however, not enough to watch it. I was wrong. It is good because it is an action film first, and a Zombie film second. Brad Pitt is very good as an agent living a normal life until the crisis calls him out of his retirement. The cinematography is way too shaky for me and that is my major criticism of the visuals in the movie. The script, dialogue, plot, acting , and directing are all very good. I like this one and it stands out in the swarm of Zombie films.","26 out of 30 found this helpful.

However, this was a pretty good movie overall. Many zombie movies are merely mindless gore and violence disguised within some fragile thing that doesn't even deserve to be called a plot. However, World War Z has a much better plot than most other zombie movies. One thing I noticed right away is that this movie actually made me jump in surprise several times. It's very suspenseful, and truly worthy of being called a ""zombie horror movie,"" as opposed to the plethora of predictable, unsuspenseful zombie movies that have come out of Hollywood. Brad Pitt does a great job in his role, although I felt his character lacked definition in many ways. It would be nice if they had ""fleshed out"" the characters a bit more. Overall, this movie is definitely worth the watch if you have a couple hours to spare. Not the best movie ever made, but a pretty good one.","81 out of 108 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Don't give up","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2836992/?ref_=tt_urv","moviemanMA","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur6078355/?ref_=tt_urv","22 July 2013","At the end of World War Z, just as the credits began rolling, a gentleman, scratch that, an idiot spoke up from the back of the theatre exclaiming, ""What? That sucked! The book was nothing like that! Booo!"" I'm sure he scurried away back home, logged online, and began tweeting, posting, and blogging, furthering his rant. Much like my response to him at the theatre, I hope he receives silence in return.It's true, World War Z is nothing like the book. The book is told from the point of view AFTER the war. It's a ""historical,"" account of what happened during the war. Rather than make a mockumentary with flashbacks, which would have been the wrong decision in my opinion, the filmmakers decided to put us right in the middle of the action.When adapting a piece of literature it is impossible to bring every page, every paragraph, every nuance onto the screen. Some have come close depending on the material, but for the most part, they all have to take their own creative licenses. After all, it's called an ""adaptation,"" for a reason, otherwise they would call it a copy or mimic.Where World War Z works (that's a mouthful) and where so many others fail is that just because the world slips into total and utter chaos, doesn't mean that governments, military, and law enforcement agencies go away. Quite the opposite. If anything, these scenarios bring out the best of all of them. We see generals, UN delegates, and scientists trying to solve complex issues that they don't know anything about. Rather than going into hiding, they act. Society doesn't crumble. Bands of cannibals and leather strapped gangs don't patrol the streets with necklaces made of teeth. People do what they can to survive, and the higher ups try their best to find a fast and effective solution.At first, I thought the movie started too fast. How could something this violent and concentrated go undetected, but after a while I got it. The opening montage of news reports said it all. How many of us listen to everything we hear on the news? Exactly. So much goes undetected while we focus on issues that effect us immediately. It's too late when the virus touches US soil. Not even social media can keep up with it.As far as zombie movies go this one is pretty great. Though I think 28 Days Later takes the cake in terms of realism, in-camera effects, and sheer terror, this one holds its own. Brad Pitt plays a former UN investigator who is traveling with his family just as the zombie attack on Philadelphia unfolds. The film goes from 0-60 before you take a sip of your Coke. This is a fast paced, edge of your seat thrill ride led by one of the finest actors of this generation (Pitt's acting ability is far too underrated and lost in the kerfuffle of tabloid news).For those of you who stare at the ticket window debating whether or not to see a film in 3D or standard, you might want to spend the extra few dollars to see this one in 3D (I know it's asking a lot, but maybe you can sneak some candy or a bottle of water to offset the concession stand price - deal with it). I tend to air on the side of ""screw it, I want to see it in 3D."" Now not every movie NEEDS to be seen in 3D, hell there are really only a couple that absolutely have to be seen in all three dimensions (Avatar and maybe Life of Pi), but this one really surprised me. 3D is not about things jumping out at you, but it's about layers. Luckily this film has both. Big chase scenes in Philly, particles floating about in South Korea, and tracking shots in Jerusalem make this one of the 3D events of the year. No exaggeration.Like so many other summer blockbusters before it, civilization is on the brink of extinction and only a handful of experts can save us. What World War Z does that so many have failed is give us hope. Hope that humanity won't dissolve into nothingness. In the face of sheer danger these fighters stand tall, take a deep breath, look the enemy in the eye, and say, ""No.""","264 out of 391 found this helpful.

(From what I've heard it's pretty far from the original source anyway.) First off, a zombie film watered-down and free from blood and gore? That idea alone would lose a big slice (pun-intended) of hardcore fans in the audience. How does it hold your attention then? By stringing you along on the edge with tension and suspense from beginning to end. It does a pretty good job of maintaining this grip even without the standard horror elements of slasher flicks.Brad Pitt easily slips into the role of a family man desperate to keep his family safe. It's not difficult to root for him and share in his urgency. His charm certainly makes up for and saves the movie from its flaws (and there are many!) not the least of which are its gaping plot holes and loose direction.The audience in the theater seemed to have fun screaming along and allowing themselves to be entertained and toyed with. There are a handful of funny scenes (whether intentional or not). If you're willing to quit analyzing the movie like a critic, you'll probably start enjoying it.After all, when did a zombie movie ever have to be ""BELIEVABLE""?","149 out of 278 found this helpful.

The categorization is not wrong, but kit changes what we typically think of when we mean zombies. These are not lumbering oafs. These are lightning-fast creatures that seem to have some sort of collective intelligence, like a colony of bees. Their abilities (most notably climbing walls) are foreign to what zombies are.Also, this should be seen as an action film first, horror film second, which seems to be the case any time Hollywood has millions of dollars to burn on a zombie film. See, for example, ""I Am Legend"". If you are looking to see Brad Pitt survive car accidents and plane crashes while traveling around the world (South Korea, Israel, Wales) this is a fine film. But if you want some scares or a film that embodies ""survival horror"", you will not get what you want.Probably the most clever thing about this was the referral of zombies as ""rakshasa"", a Hindu demon that feeds on human flesh. Maybe this has already been covered in Bollywood, but it seems that the concept is rather new here. The zombies (or infected) in this film are not actually rakshasa, but it does raise the question: where are Hindu demons in the horror film? If we can have Onibaba and other Asian creatures, why not something from a country with over one billion people? But this is a bit of a sidetrack...Anyway, good film if you want big budget action and Brad Pitt fighting computer-generated undead while sporting the greasiest hair since Kid Rock. Bad film if you want slow, lumbering Romero zombies. But to each his own, I guess.","15 out of 22 found this helpful.

I can't leave my family ! .Where there is life, there is hope !.Better than average Zombie movie includes hectic action , thrills , chills , gutsy scenes , violent fights and loads of gore . In World War Z (2013) happens a lot of disturbing occurrences with thousands of Zombies toppling armies and governments and threatening to destroy humanity itself , including suspense , intrigue , turns , a lot of twisted incidents , at the same time charged with tension , unflinching depictions of graphic violence and high level staging which the viewer could really enjoy . Several overwhelming scenes , including large-scale battles with the zombies , though some of them were dropped from the final cut in order to water down the film's political undertones . Interesting and nail-biting storyline from Matthew Michael Carnahan and J. Michael Straczynski , though Damon Lindelof and Drew Goddard rewrote the screenplay . Paramount Pictures acquired screen rights to the Max Brooks novel ""World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War , as they spent $1 million on the film rights . Lavishly produced by Paramount along with other independient producers as Ian Bryce , David Ellison , Marc Forster , Dede Gardner , Dana Goldberg and Brad Pitt himself . It's a solid film , a terror story plenty of suspense , restless horror, and including a lot of CGI with state-of-art special effects . Brad Pitt -producer as well- gives a splendid acting as former United Nations employee who traverses the world in a race against time to stop a zombie pandemic .

What this movie truly is, is a shamefully mediocre attempt to create a movie that appeals to the widest audience possible. Pee established fan base from the book? Check. Star power (this is Brad Pitt)? Check. Focuses on intensity rather than horror and gore to not alienate non zombie fans? Check. Safe, young PG 13 rating? Check. All the makings are here because this is what the big Hollywood studio wanted. Despite the fact this movie doesn't resemble the book at all, it appears that those attached to make this movie tried to make a decent movie such as the visually interesting director Marc Foster who wanted to make a movie with a message which would emulate the tone the book was going for. However, the big studio disliked this and demanded rewrites and re-shooting that damaged the relationship between the director and Brad and results in a quick, intense action movie that lacks the character development and messages it needed to be a truly memorable movie because almost every one of those scenes were cut so much to the point that central characters get barley any lines. While the action scenes are intense and enjoyable on their own and Marc foster adds style to the lack of substance but its just not enough to save this movie. While it is better than it had any right to be thanks to Marc, it needs more and it lacks in crucial substance. However from the reviews and box office reports it appears Hollwood has succeeded in creating a successful marketable movie that everyone will eat up and it will be too late when we all get the nasty aftertaste.....","271 out of 542 found this helpful.

There's no need to misunderstand what this movie is. It's simply a popcorn movie. Although unlike other post-apocalyptic movie, there isn't the standard eerie empty city scenes. The zombie mystery is investigated in a Bond movie fashion. Brad Pitt travels all around the world following leads. It's actually easy to follow and really compelling.

"7","/10","World War Z is an entertaining, fun night out but not original in the slightest","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2820813/?ref_=tt_urv","FilmMuscle","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18123905/?ref_=tt_urv","27 June 2013","Finally, after years of facing difficulty with production and resources, World War Z has come our way, and it promises an epic and grandeur scale. The film definitely contains most of the elements fans have always desired in a zombie movie; it actually mixes horror, suspense, and action all in one movie. One act transpires underneath the roofs of a daunting apartment building when another act takes the audience across the world to Israel where the people left are forced to defend themselves against a monstrously colossal horde of zombies as they pile in. There are jump-scares. There are grisly and highly unfortunate deaths. Anyways, the film focuses on Brad Pitt's character (Gerry Lane) who's required to assist the UN with discovering a possible vaccine/cure to the horrifying virus that's spreading throughout the world and turning human beings into ghastly creatures. If he refuses to comply, they'll willingly kick his entire family off a tanker- one of the few safe locations left in the world. From there on, Gerry Lane is forced to transcend country after country in order to secure his family's safety and possibly save humanity. A hell of a lot is at stake, that's for sure. Now, I can definitely state that one of the best aspects of the film is its acting, especially Brad Pitt's, which, as usual, doesn't disappoint. One can clearly witness the fear and terror present in almost every character's eyes, as well as one specific character quite convincingly pulling off the feeling of sheer pain under horrendous circumstances. With that being said, the very beginning of the film starts off a little bizarrely as the pace seems to suffer. With the running time that the movie possesses, such a rich and complex story is compacted to fit its duration, which means right off the bat, we're met with the apocalypse and the zombie outbreak. We only receive a few minutes, if that, of the main family's daily lives until they're cast into the conflict almost instantly. As a result, conversations feel extremely and oddly brief and segments that could've been expanded on feel like they're set on ""fast forward"" in order to get to the ""point."" This means that there's much less space for character development and characterization in general, and zombie movies (or we can say Horror movies as a whole) definitely need to spend some time on their characters so that the audience is able to connect with them and feel for them as they progress on their journey. When they feel fear, we have to feel fear for them as well. Unfortunately, as this is largely a Hollywood blockbuster and not something like 28 Weeks Later, the film has to reach the action-packed bits as soon as possible. And this is when the film will cause a fair amount of decisiveness- the audience who read the book will approach the film differently than the ones who've seen the trailers and are just simply interested in the plot that's promised. I've read up on reviews, and most of the negative reviews originate from the individuals who expected an honest- shall I say- adaptation of the book (this is exactly the issue that faced The Great Gatsby or any other adaptation for that matter). I haven't read the book, which means I don't need to furiously rant about the film's disconnection from its novelistic counterpart. If you haven't read the book, you have no reason to worry about potential disappointment; that's practically reserved for the book's fans. If you're a book fan, on the other hand, you should be expecting the two's differentiation from one another. So, to put it most understandably, if you're entering this movie the way it was marketed, you'll experience a wild, roller-coaster ride that's fairly effective in its capability of featuring some dramatic moments of diplomatic negotiations and political discussions over the world's collapse and then placing you into intensely impossible situations only to be followed by an incredibly suspenseful, nerve-wracking sequence. It's highly entertaininghowever, it's the furthest from originality a film can get. I mean, it's yet another zombie movie, dealing with the entire world under a deadly zombie virus. You've basically seen everything in this movie already as 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later highlighted the serious effects of such an event already. In that case- during its first act- World War Z feels unbelievably similar to the two films mentioned above. Especially considering the decision to exclude the more political aspect of the novel and turning the adaptation into an action flick instead, there's not much here that'll bask in uniqueness, really. This all begs the question: how much longer will these numerous entertainment industries create zombie stories after zombie stories? It's time to move on to another fascinating idea. Leave the genre alone, but then again, as long as these studios continue to rake in millions, they'll continually produce the same product. In the end, World War Z is a fun, entertaining night out, but if you can't make it to the showing, don't feel too bad because you've most likely seen everything displayed in this film already.","87 out of 164 found this helpful.

"5","/10","A Very Puzzling Missed Opportunity","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2819128/?ref_=tt_urv","fosterino","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17925311/?ref_=tt_urv","24 June 2013","The story of how World War Z was made is a lot more harrowing and suspenseful than the film itself. After going way over-budget and enduing a complete revision and reshoot of the final act, WWZ wasn't exactly set up for success. Ultimately the movie is completely forgettable and uneven, but not offensively bad or objectively terrible in any sense. What struck me about it was how much of a wasted opportunity it was, given how interesting and entertaining the source material is.Having read the book World War Z, I could tell from the trailers for this movie that it wouldn't exactly be a faithful adaptation. I thought that the most interesting aspects of the book were its exploration of how the Zombie plague affected social and political structures across the world. Anything like that is completely ignored in the film, but I can at least understand how the filmmakers thought that those aspects wouldn't work in a single feature length movie. What I can't understand is how the filmmakers seemingly ignored the book's most obviously cinematic content. The book features a lot of setpiece action scenes, and to be fair, many of these involve world cities falling to zombie infestation and the movie does do enough to cover this. However, the book's immense battle scenes - the meat of the titular Zombie War, such as the Battle of Yonkers, nuclear war between Pakistan and Iran, Chinese civil war and massive formation combat against zombies - are completely absent. I was very surprised that they did not cover these, especially the Yonkers scene, because they would obviously fit so well into a film and the script, even as it is now, could easily be tweaked to include or at least mention them. The action that did make it into this film is very unsatisfying and obscure thanks to the restrictions of the PG-13 rating, and the narrative around is not engaging enough to really get me invested in it.I was also surprised at how cheap this movie looked. This film cost hundreds of millions of dollars to make, but it's hard to see where it all went on the screen. Swarms of zombies look very fake and nonthreatening, and in some cases individual zombies are computer animated, which gave me bad flashbacks to I Am Legend's awful CGI overload. Aside from the opening scenes in Philadelphia and the middle act in Jerusalem, there are no big outdoor sets. A South Korean airbase is portrayed as a series of dark rooms; too much of the movie takes place in an airline seat; there is a lot of sitting around inside of the aircraft carrier, etc. The sense of scale is very inconsistent, and this is accentuated in the bizarre final act, which was obviously the focus of the infamous reshoots as it feels like a completely separate movie. I consider myself a patient viewer, but this very long and dull scene started to bring me down after a while, and my less patient viewing audience eventually fell completely out of sync with the film and began to make fun of it at every opportunity - not really a fair criticism of the film, but it's a real issue when it can't hold an audience's attention. The final act does actually have an interesting idea at its heart, albeit one that completely doesn't connect with anything in the book, but I just didn't think it was a well executed concept. The very different style and tone of these scenes makes it feel like a completely different movie.Again, while there was nothing all that terrible about WWZ, I didn't think it was anything to get excited about. In other words, a perfect 5/10 movie. I wish they were more aware of the source material's potential because without the best and most cinematic aspects of the book, WWZ (the film)and WWZ (the book) only share a title and the central premise of a zombie plague, which is not an original idea in itself.","673 out of 1,036 found this helpful.

It's a very intense movie, focusing on the world's response after a virus starts turning millions into the living dead. North Korea figures out an inventive, if gruesome, method of how to prevent the virus from spreading within its borders. But the zombies are definitely the stars. They turn out to be really clever creatures, as seen by what they do in Israel. Watching just about any zombie movie, I always get the feeling that the people playing the zombies must have the most fun.I will say that this is no George Romero movie. It's designed more for widespread popularity, while Romero's movies are specifically for horror fans (and thus are gorier). But it's not a bad movie.

There was nothing overly special with it but it was not by any means a bad movie. The effects and acting were good, and the plot was fine. For a movie where the main plot point is to search the globe for patient zero and discover the cure to save humanity, one would think there would be some sense of urgency; however, this was not conveyed. The urgency in each situation was there, but for the overall film it seemed he was merely doing his normal, day-to-day job.One issue that has resonated with me is Matthew Fox. As a fan of Lost, I was excited to see him in the movie, but his role is very small, useless, and that of a nameless actor. Perhaps originally he had more of a role and ended up being cut. Fox could have been cut to seem like a cameo appearance or cut altogether but he ended up as nameless ""Parajumper."" Hopefully DVD extras or a sequel will flesh out this awkwardly placed actor.For a zombie movie the director, Marc Forster, played it far too safe. There was very little in terms of gore, blood and violence, which made for a disappointing horror and zombie movie. The previews also gave the impression that World War Z was an action movie but all action is shown in the preview, which could be disappointing for action movie fans.Like many similar movies, we are expected to suspend reality that the hero can face so many obstacles and come out the other side while many sidekicks are lost; this is no different. I am okay with this though, I enjoy the ridiculousness of it anyways. The children in this movie though should have gotten him killed right off the bat, further cementing the idea to drop the kids in the event of zombie apocalypse. They were overly annoying and needy, even for children.Now, in comparison to the book, of which I am a huge fan, it is even more of a let down. The book is an amazing novel that examines both the brutality and compassion of humanity in times of war. It examines different people from all over the world before, during and after the ""Zombie War."" It is more than just another zombie book. Perhaps due to time constraints, budgets, editing or any other number of reasons, the core of the story is lost. The idea of a U.N. investigator travelling the world and the recounts of Israel are the only aspects of the film that resemble the source material. Hopefully Forster is given the opportunity to make the trilogy he imagined and attempt to redeem himself, but due to the problems with the first movie, this seems unlikely.Although this review may seem like I disliked the movie, I actually found it to be quite enjoyable. I am simply very disappointed that the filmmakers made another race against the clock movie, even though it had so much potential to be thought-provoking and original. If only Danny Boyle was behind it; we could have had one of the greatest zombie movie ever created.World War Z was my biggest let down of the year so far. After a great weekend that included Man of Steel and This Is The End, I would suggest passing on it in favor of these more enjoyable movies. I would suggest seeing it at some point as it is a good movie, but it does not need to be on the big screen or in 3D.From the blog: tilfilmdouspart.blogspot.com","18 out of 31 found this helpful.

I had forgotten how good it is. Unlike most zombie movies that tend to focus on a small, isolated group under threat. Typically, one or more of this group are mentally unhinged which adds to the suspense, but that set up has been a cliche for decades now.WWZ takes the opposite approach. It takes the mile high view through the eyes of one scientist, who travels the globe trying to solve the dilemma.The action pieces are imaginative and large scale. Interestingly, the final sequence is scaled right back down to the handful of isolated people for contrast.It's interesting to read of all the behind-the-scenes troubles that plagued the making of this movie. In spite of it all, it all came together to create a very gritty and entertaining movie.I would like to see a sequel to this movie. Pitt's character could put in an appearance, but it could be about a completely new group of people. This movie certainly left that possibility open, but it doesn't look like it's ever going to happen.","14 out of 17 found this helpful.

Suddenly, the world is plagued by a mysterious infection turning whole human populations into rampaging mindless zombies. After barely escaping the chaos, Lane is persuaded to go on a mission to investigate this disease.I watched this when it was first released and liked it as an adventure film. However I came across the DVD and decided to watch it in retrospect of the Lockdown.Far from the worlds great and good working together to find a solution, our response was to Lockdown hoping that that would solve the problem: quickly realising it would not solve it, but might slow it somewhat.What was interesting was that they found no cure for COVID, but all Govt's around the world adopted the same dogmatic approach of masks, distancing and isolating, even knowing that these would have no impact whatsoever. So why waste time and money on such endeavours? A project that has cost the world greatly in many different ways and the repercussions will last for generations.It's interesting to see Hollywood's approach which is much more simple and functional. Find a way to not get infected, then find a way to kill the virus.As a film this was fabulous entertainment. As a means of showing us where we get things right and where we get them wrong it was also very helpful. Let's hope if there is another pandemic we will cope much better?Deserves a 7 for an entertaining and suspenseful plot.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

World War Z is good enough not to fall on the classification of lousy or awful. At least it does not drag; the movie is engaging and never ever slows down to cause the slightest bit of boredom. At best, it feels like what I imagine would be a perfectly well-made zombie video game adaptation. I'm sure that the movie has some intellectual or subliminal message hidden in and around the movie, or whatever message the writers want to convey. Whatever it may be, we could not really notice that since the pace of the film is fast and hyperactive. But at least it's never chaotic and messy.On the horror aspect, it effectively does generate some screams and shouts. The scares are moderately efficient, and the zombies do indeed manage to be horrifying, even though they did not need to be extra disgusting and/or gory.Although this may be considered as a zombie movie, it never crosses beyond its PG-13 rating. Meaning, it does not have the usual gore and violence other zombies have. Whatever violence the movie has is never focused or highlighted. It's a horror movie that may be considered ""pretty safe"" for a younger audience.The problem with World War Z is that it's blown its wad by showing some of the best money shots of the movie on its trailer. The flooding stampede of zombies is the film's most impressive and unique eye candy. We've already seen fast zombies, we've also already seen extra-strong zombies (in ""I Am Legend"" they're not exactly zombies, but they have similarities with the zombies in this movie), but we've never seen them like this, the way World War Z presents them. On one point of view, it's refreshingly unique, on another point of view; it's a childish, over-bloated exaggeration of the concept.But the flooding, stampeding zombies; that's the movie's one ace card. Aside from that, the movie is pretty simple horror suspense. What happens in the end is not your typical summer blockbuster climax scene; there's nothing extraordinary, like a big boss fight of some kind. With the way it was executed in the end, it felt like an indie horror movie.But just because it has a quiet ending, it does not mean that it was a bad movie. The ending is consistent and fluid. It's not something impossible, incredible, explosive, or cartoonish. It's simple, and it makes sense that way in a manner consistent with the movie's tone. Overall, World War Z is a moderately good zombie movie; entertaining enough to be worth your money and time. But you will not be missing out on anything if you happen to skip it.","39 out of 82 found this helpful.

You saw the zombie apocalypse coming didn't you? Not a literal apocalypse of course, just 16 dozen different zombie books, graphic novels, games and TV shows taking over the world like the plague, and you just had to have your piece of the pie, didn't you?World War Z is based on the 2006 novel by Max Brooks. The novel garnered some quite positive reviews, praised for its international and political scope. It also caught the eye of producer and star Brad Pitt, who after a long struggle with studios, directors, producers and other Hollywood zombies, managed to put together a half decent movie with director Marc Forster.Half decent? Well, WWZ certainly isn't a bad movie. You've got the long-time Oscar-deserving Pitt playing Gerry Lane, a likable, good-looking family man who retired as a UN investigator to spend more time around his wife and daughters. This is all about to change obviously, because after the now seemingly mandatory news-footage-montage introduction, Gerry is called back by the UN in exchange for his family's safety on their big boat.It sounds good enough, but the problem is that WWZ's political/international context is nowhere to be found so we're left pretty much to 28 Days Later with blockbuster pretentiousness. Sure, Gerry travels around the world and makes a few long distance phone calls, but there's never anything remotely compelling enough to warrant his travels and whenever the plot does manage to come close to something it quickly sets it aside in the interest of keeping this summer blockbuster light, family friendly and internationally marketable.After Quantum of Solace there was much uncertainty about Forster's ability to direct action and after WWZ, guess what? There still is. Granted, it's never boring, but when the other elements that should've made the film aren't there it should be more than ""never boring"". Paramount's marketing certainly didn't help; if you've seen the trailers then you've seen the whole plot and LITERALLY every single action set piece, in chronological order too. You know when you see a trailer and think ""they put all the good parts in""? Well, this time they put the whole movie in. The more hardcore genre fans might also want to look elsewhere if they're seeking gory zombie kills; there isn't much of that either as its PG-13 rating might suggest.Brad Pitt is really the film's only strength. Much like Tom Cruise, Brad's got enough talent to singlehandedly pull you through a not-so-great movie without you hating him for it. And at almost age 50 you can't really blame him for wanting to star in his own big blockbuster franchise for the first time in his career when he could've played any superhero he wanted years ago. ""Franchise"" of course, if permitted by the audience, because this is one movie that desperately wants to have sequels.","467 out of 765 found this helpful.

As a result I put off watching World War Z but I was still interested in seeing such a big budget zombie film. The plot sees some form of outbreak and, well, you know what happens. No sooner has Gerry Lane rescued his family from one city, than he is rescued by his old UN employers who want him to help lead a mission to try and find a solution by escorting a doctor to South Korea. No pressure, but the space for his family in safe haven does rely on him saying ""yes"".After some very brief character establishment (references to ""old job"", happy family image etc), we get the first of many set-pieces as an outbreak sweeps across the city and, like many of the set-pieces, it is pretty good stuff. There is plenty of money on the table, lots going on and the scale of it all is suitable for a plot about a global outbreak. The problem is that it never really feels like more than this and the bits in between are not great. The biggest criticism that I can offer is that it did nothing to be other than make me watch the noisy scenes in the way I would with any big blockbuster – and I remind you that I am normally chilled by zombie movies. Here I felt that apart from once or twice, it didn't really do the tension or the horror well, it almost felt too slick, too expensive.To give a contrast, an outbreak in a closed car park in 28 Weeks Later was really horrific to me (in a good way) but here the one on a plane didn't bring that same feeling. It is hard for me to put my finger on it, but for sure something was missing here. The plot doesn't help – jumping around the world without much linkage and asking the viewer to just go with it; perhaps I would if I had cared more, but everyone apart from Brad Pitt seemed so disposable – just fodder for the attack shots, so I did get numb and also feel remote from it all. Technically it is great and it really is well shot and put together, but it is just the lack of atmosphere that hurts it the most.It is a big expensive movie though and as a blockbuster it works well enough to give it a go, but it really never works in the ways that would have made it a much superior film.","50 out of 75 found this helpful.

WWZ centers around a former UN investigator with some knowledge about infectious disease, traveling the world, trying to get a fix on the zombie outbreak problem. Hats off to the visual guys for making it all look and feel frighteningly thrilling. The best part of this film is the speed of the zombies here, they move faster than typical zombies.

The rating, the early reviews, my love of gory George Romero movies had all led me to deciding not to see this. But, my wife wanted to go... Well, two breathless hours later I turned to her, big grin on my face and had to state ""That was awesome!"" Yes, I can see why people don't like it. It is very different to the traditional zombie movie, and very different to the book. But you know what, who cares - it's not a traditional zombie movie, or the book - it's different. So suck it it up whiners and enjoy this for what it is! (And I'm a huge fan of all Max Brooks zombie books.) The movie begins with a short intro to the main character and his family (it was enough, it told me all I needed to know) before launching into a fantastic, break neck sequence that establishes the pace for most of the rest of the movie. It's violent, visceral and shocking without any reliance in gore. The tension is racked up (especially in the escape from the apartment block sequence) with a series of spectacular set pieces (the walls of Jerusalem scene is brilliant) and things get better and bigger until the film slows the pace for the final reel with a slow burning, smaller scale sequence set in a WHO research lab in the UK. It's an unusual choice to end a movie with the smallest set piece, but it worked well for me as it was in line with Gerry's quest and the (stated in the movie) fact that the answer is often so small it gets overlooked. The gravity of the decisions Gerry has to make here are greater than any previously in the movie (where mostly he just has to run like hell!) and it's that that makes this such a powerful set piece to end the movie. I learnt several things from this movie 1) to let go of my preconceptions about what a zombie film should be, 2) that a low rating doesn't mean its for kids - I have two sons and despite the lack of gore I certainly wouldn't let then see this. Its very intense and that (not the gore) is what would scare them. 3) to go with the flow - I did here and was swept along for a rapid fire 2 hour thrill ride that was a hell of a lot of fun. I for one will be getting this on blu ray and I'll be first in line for any sequel. But I will admit, an undated version would be very welcome!","514 out of 898 found this helpful.

Take an amazing book with a cult following and simply try and stay as close to the text as possible given the cinematic limitations that exist. Not a new or ground breaking concept.Instead we have man versus a multitude of monsters.

Nowadays zombie movies are ten-a-penny and zombies are in the public consciousness alongside vampires and werewolves.But WORLD WAR Z offers something new: the first, straight, big-budget zombie blockbuster. Sure, PLANET TERROR skirted with the premise but with a sci-fi twist, while this is straightforward zombie stuff. It's based on the terrible Max Brooks book of the same title, but don't let that put you off; unlike the book, it actually has a structured narrative, and characters.And I loved it. I'm not normally a fan of CGI unless it's done right, but it's done right here. Scenes of the zombies attacking en masse are brilliantly conceived, and the set-piece that takes place in Israel in the middle of the movie is simply phenomenal. It's a film that also manages to be vicious and frightening without being gory, which is a fine achievement. If you thought the infected in 28 DAYS LATER moved fast then you haven't seen anything yet! Sure, the characters are thinly-sketched, but that matters little as WORLD WAR Z follows an action-thriller template. Brad Pitt's lead is both the luckiest and unluckiest guy on the planet at the same time, and the film never deviates from getting up close and personal with its undead menace. The worst thing about it is Marc Forster's fuddled direction, something that also spoiled QUANTUM OF SOLACE, but it's not a big enough to detraction to stop this from being anything other than a solid film.","35 out of 52 found this helpful.

I recommend this movie to those who like action, adventure and horror movies. But it would also be good for those who aren't really crazy about movies of this genre to watch it. The movie offers entertainment like we haven't seen in a long time. It doesn't waste much time with unnecessary scenes. The adventure starts at 5 minutes and ends 1 minute before the end of the movie.The only flaw is that in some scenes the camera is faster than it needs to be to follow the movie, but it's not a huge bother. Brad Pitt, who is also one of the producers, plays the main role brilliantly. The two main female actresses - Mireille Enos and Daniella Kerz are amazing as well. The film also features David Morse and Matthew Fox in cameo roles, along with the main international cast, which includes - Pierfrancesco Favino, Moritz Bleibtreu, Nikola Djuricko, and many others.In other words, this movie is not a work of art, but it relaxes to the limit, and that is a very important fact when watching a movie. If you want a small escape from reality and relax, watch this high-budget movie of 190 million dollars, where 120 minutes of adventure await you.","7 out of 8 found this helpful.

A feature film a film can succeed if its critically acclaimed or commercially successful, but money is usually the bottom line in Hollywood. Fortunately in both cases, my advanced screening of World War Z was free, it wasn't overly long and as a bonus I felt quite entertained.What sells me this film initially as a moviegoer is the mystery surrounding the film both narrative and production wise; and the questions it poses , what is the source of the outbreak? How is this effecting everyone and how are certain countries dealing with it? What is the cure? Is there a cure? What perplexes me as an industry analyst is why certain decisions were made regarding the production of the film. Why, for instance would you hire an indie director with only a little mainstream experience (Quantum of Solace) to direct such a large scale film? Or why on earth would you hire Damon Lindelof to write something that needed an ending? Not all these questions get answered but the film is sufficient enough.There hasn't ever been a zombie film on this scale before so this is something at least slightly new and ambitious. I can't say I respect the choice made for it to be an adaptation in name only because I have yet to read the book, and the original script was so well heralded. At least the political subtext lives on in the original source material, and can be be adapted later into a perhaps better film, that maybe shouldn't be tailor made for a mainstream blockbuster audiences. I wouldn't call this a big dumb zombie movie either as it seems like a cheap oversimplification. Funny enough that is what the movie is in regards to its source material.Brad Pitt tries to help Daniella Kertesz keep it together as he's in over his head at 30,000 feet. There were a lot of compromises made for this film, as evidenced by the script doctor leaving the film, the entire third act being replaced, and various re-shoots. The political subtext is nowhere to be found, and various characters are introduced and never show up again. All this was meant to be done in service of the movie and for the most part works. Each character feels real and two dimensional or is at least interesting, the film is well paced. It isn't glaringly obvious this film has holes unless you decide to sit back and think about it after the film is done. There are no major tonal issues or character defects here, but the film does change direction and speed a bit. I have two gripes about this film; one is the Lindelof trademark of characters either getting caught in stupid situations or making stupid decisions to advance the plot, which isn't as annoying as it was in 'Prometheus' or 'Star Trek Into Darkness' but enough to make you roll your eyes. The other gripe is that because this is a straight-forward action-thriller there is nothing for your brains to feast on afterwards. This is digestible B-Level entertainment.Steven Spielberg and George Lucas recently spoke at a USC conference predicting a film industry implosion. Production companies are spending more and more money on fewer and fewer films, and all its going to take is a few of them to bomb before everything comes crashing down (Say for instance; this film, The Lone Ranger, and Pacific Rim). The problem with this film is that quality wise it is not a great return on investment for it's 200 million+ Hollywood price tag or a $15 theatre ticket for the audience, I wouldn't pay full price for this movie in pointless 3D, but I'm sure a compromise of some sorts can be worked out.Verdict: B/+1/ Worth seeing on cheap Tuesday but not in 3D","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

It does not waste more than five minutes before introducing the zombies and from then on it is no sleep for mr. Pitt. If you like suspense, action and zombies, WWZ is definitely a must-see. Had I seen this on DVD, and not in the theater, I would have screamed out loud several times. The title is a little misleading, I think. Definitely, a world war is happening in the movie, but it is not where the focus is - the focus is on Brad Pitt and his family. You get to see the world destroyed by zombies, don't worry, but it is more a case of Brad Pitt saving the world than the army saving the world, and this is my main criticism of this movie. Why is Brad Pitt the only one who can figure out what to do all the time? I think he is too superhero-like in the movie, and that took away some of the realism, which is much needed in zombie flicks to not make it too far out there. On the other hand, it was a nice change to see the zombie apocalypse from the point of view of someone working with the system to stop it, rather than from a ""normal"" person's point of view, who is hiding and trying to survive. We have seen that many times, and it is fascinating to imagine to be in that situation, but WWZ is a nice new angle. Expect Die Hard meets 28 Days Later rather than The Walking Dead.And, damn, this movie is scary! The zombies, ones you get to see them up close, are so creepy and so so fast - I was jumping in my seat hoping Brad Pitt and Co. would run faster. I had adrenaline pumping through my body leaving the theater and I almost ran to the car.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

The movie really brings a new level for the Zombie genre and is on the Top of my list for Zombie movies.Another good plus, is that the Title World War Z is very true, because it is not just based in one City like other Zombie movies, but all over the world.

Gerry Lane has to travel around the world with a race against time in order to find an antidote and stop the zombie outbreak. I was very excited to watch World War Z, the trailers looks superb and not many zombie apocalypse films are released now a days. Before the film was released I found it had a huge build up in order to become the summer blockbuster. However is World War Z the action packed thriller for this summer? No, no it isn't. The story of World War Z was very vague as the summary of the story is simply ""Kill Zombies. Find Cure"". Many scenes in the films were very predictable for example there is a scene where Gerry Lane is in a near death experience however because your only twenty minutes into the film and his the main character, you know he will survive. World War Z was an 'enjoyable' zombie film however it was nowhere as good as Dawn of the Dead or Zombieland. Brad Pitt is the only well known actor in the film who does a brilliant job of playing the character Gerry Lane. I thought that Gerry's wife and children had the most pointless roles in the film, I would of preferred it if Gerry Lane was by alone and had to survive the zombie apocalypse instead of hiding in a helicopter or plane for most of the film. The only part of the film I particularly enjoyed was when Gerry was in Jerusalem and there was millions of zombies behind a wall forcing them to jump and collide on each other forming a tower of zombies. The CGI in the film was impressive however I felt like there was too many zombies in World War Z if that is possible and the actual zombies in the film can only be described in two words fast and furious. The filming locations are interesting in this film are you don't know where Gerry is going next from the streets of Philadelphia to slums of Jerusalem. This film was directed by Marc Foster who directed Quantum of Solace which in my opinion was the least best Daniel Craig Bond film. As this is an action movie there are no complaints about the action in this film, they were brilliant many action scenes of the films made me on the edge of my seat wanting to know who Gerry is going to escape this disaster. When the film ends it finishes with this quote ""If you can fight, fight. Be prepared for anything. Our war has just began"". This quote left me thinking please don't say they are making a sequel for this film they have found the antidote to stop the zombie horde for gods sake. All in all World War Z was an enjoyable zombie apocalypse film, the action scenes lead you at the edge of your seat. However the story could've been more thrilling or at least more entertaining.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie is loosely based on the 2006 novel of the same name by Max Brooks.The film takes place in the aftermath of a zombie outbreak that has devastated the world. Brad Pitt plays a former UN investigator who is tasked with finding the origin of the outbreak and developing a cure before the infection spreads any further.One of the strengths of World War Z is its fast-paced action sequences. The zombies in the movie are not the slow-moving, shuffling creatures of traditional zombie films, but instead they are fast and agile, creating a sense of urgency and danger that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats.Brad Pitt delivers a solid performance as the film's lead, bringing both physical and emotional intensity to the role. The supporting cast, however, is somewhat forgettable, and the characters are not given enough depth or development to truly care about their fates.The film also has some impressive visual effects, particularly in the scenes where the zombie hordes swarm over cities and buildings. However, the CGI can be somewhat uneven in places and occasionally looks a bit fake.One of the weaknesses of the film is its lack of a strong narrative. The plot feels somewhat disjointed and episodic, with the film jumping from one set-piece to another without much connective tissue. This can make the film feel a bit shallow and unsatisfying.Overall, World War Z is an entertaining action-horror film with some impressive set-pieces and solid performances. While it may not be the most deep or nuanced film, it's a fun ride for those who enjoy zombie movies and action thrillers.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film stuck to a realistic view of a zombie apocalypse, not from some fantasy world perspective, but from the real world.The cinematography was well done, using the low-lighting to add to suspense while still lit enough to see what was going on. The sound design was nice, no jump-scare screeching sound or over-the-top score/soundtrack. (8/10)Not a fan of the cast, but they did a good job with their roles. I was honestly most impressed with the zombies, especially during the hospital scene. The movement was directed very well. The CG was visually impressive/appealing and the editing went unnoticed. (9/10)The story at least had a common goal, ""find a cure"" although the plot (how it unfolded) was all over the place. It seems like a lot of the plot was only introduced to carry on the story, and didn't feel natural, although it at least felt believable. The dialogue was mid-tier. (4/10)The films conclusion is probably the best it could have been, which is why overall I feel the film was decent. It introduced an idea, took us for a (slightly confusing but believable) ride, and finished with a bang.

Well made, some great acting (and some not so great), and some good scary scenes, and maybe that's enough. It is, after all, a summer movie.But it could have been different. Having the zombies sprint and have superhuman resistance to getting hurt makes for exciting scenes of mass chaos and running and running. It speeds up the normal dread and fear of the classic Romero style zombies. But it also makes the whole thing kind of just a sensation, and it borders on silly, or it would if so many people weren't getting killed and zombified.The whole movie is about excess, everything speeded up and boiling down to confrontation and decision on the spot. There is almost zero expectation or suspense. In fact, one of the clearly best scenes in the movie comes near the end when Brad Pitt (who is great throughout) has a one-on-one with a zombie through a glass door. It takes time, it has the audience wondering. It isn't just about shock and reaction to shock, but about anticipating shock. And then, yes, you don't always need the shock.Pitt's wife in this is a bore and it's not really her fault. She is given the role of being a good wife and protecting their children, which she does. The only woman with substance is a little known Israeli woman (actress Daniella Kertesz) and even she becomes someone Pitt has to save. Which he does. With style and a little out there medical treatment (I mean before they get on the plane!). Ha. The movie is really quite fun and fast and zippy. If it's obvious and superficial, maybe I expect too much.But wait, aren't there other movies that go here and do better at making it work on several levels? Like ""Children of Men"" which has a similar futuristic chaotic vision and yet lots of novel turns and much more amazing filming. ""World War Z"" is not filmed badly by any means, but it depends a lot on fast cuts (and multiple cuts) which create that barrage effect rather than a more coherent following the action through the disaster, which works better for the viewer. And then there is the issue of plausibility. I know, who cares? Well, on some level it changes how you take the movie. If it is just comic book stuff, and the superhero can do anything, then whatever, sure (though even superheroes have rules of play). But for example they realize at some point a way to work around the way the zombies attack anyone living so quickly, and yet don't explain or suggest at all how the zombies would know one kind of victim from another. (I'm trying not to give anything away.) They just ""know"" and this becomes a chink in their armor.I don't know. I found it frustrating just as much as fun. I saw it in 3-D and that was dispensable, I think. I mean--it's a novelty, but the movie doesn't really need it. There's plenty of depth, and action, and visual complexity, without it. Save the three bucks unless you're a devotee.Thanks Brad Pitt for holding this all together. He dominates every scene, and for good reason. And look at the original book, which has a lot of differences (like no main character) and a unique construction (as a U.N. official document). This is an adaptation, and it borrows from the clichés with heavy-handed dependability.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

The mystery of the infection, and the subtle but quite fulfilling explanation throughout the movie.The action and visual effect is nothing less than stunning. I was in awe most of the scene.Never in a long time that a movie made me grip the handle of my seats because it's so thrilling. The cinematography, sound effect, and editing made it a roller coaster ride in a theme park.It was definitely money well spent.

"7","/10","Nothing to Do With the Book, Except for the Zombies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2816514/?ref_=tt_urv","3xHCCH","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4294858/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2013","The trailer for this film was very exciting. It did not show anything really about what the film was about, except for some big unknown event that was turning the city into sudden chaos one morning.I found out that there was a book that inspired this film, so I sought it out to read it. I was surprised to discover that this book, and I guess likewise the film, is about ZOMBIES! The trailers (wisely, I thought) did NOT show zombies at all. The book by Max Brooks was a compilation of short man vs. zombie stories which were happening all over the world. More than 50% into the book, I did not read any scene that remotely resembled the scenes shown in the trailer. I was ready at that point to concede that this Brad Pitt film will have nothing to do with the book except for the main fighting a worldwide zombie infestation premise. And I turned out to be right.""World War Z"", the film, is about Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), a UN special operations agent, who had retired from that job to be with his family. (This character Gerry Lane was NOT even in the book.) We follow Gerry's adventures as it starts in his home town of Philadelphia, PA, as we saw in the trailer, when he gets his family to safety, and was then assigned to play a vital role in the zombie fight. The rest of the film brings Gerry to Korea, Israel, and Wales as he was able to observe and hypothesize a possible weakness in these zombies. The latter third of the film happens in a WHO facility where he was able to actually conduct the experiment he needed to prove his theory. Can Gerry discover the key to turn the tide of the war to the human's favor or will the zombies continue to spread their plague?The zombie scenes were NOT unnecessarily gory. There were NO scenes of exploding heads or trailing guts or gushing body fluids which are commonly seen in other zombie movies, even as these were very graphically described in the book. While horror purists would call this lame, the way it was done in this film was not any less exciting, yet makes this movie more accessible to more people. This could have been a spectacular gore fest, but obviously the filmmakers had a different vision in mind.The scenes of the mass zombie attacks were very well-executed by the computer-generated visual effects. The Jerusalem scenes were especially disturbing and heart-racing. The scenes on the Belarus Airlines jet plane were also exciting as they were unbelievable. They try their best to give credible scientific approach to the problem, and I would give them props for that. This is even if the plan was on the simplistic side, and shaky in the medical sense. Opportunistic infections, anyone? However, they did prepare us for that solution by the statement a character makes at the beginning of the mission.Brad Pitt did well as the lead actor. He was practically the only known name in the cast, and he dominates the screen with this star presence. Yet, we can still empathize with his character Gerry and the difficult situations he got into, no matter how incredibly lucky or superhuman he may have become. He had a ""sort-of"" commercial for a particular soft- drink brand towards the end, which was amusing, yet still well- integrated in the action of the scene.Even if the film had almost nothing to do with the book, I found this movie quite absorbing and intense, and ultimately entertaining and satisfying. Maybe they should have just changed the title.","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

"","","Sweepingly epic but a little too late.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2820863/?ref_=tt_urv","amesmonde","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1761695/?ref_=tt_urv","27 June 2013","A mysterious virus like infection spreads rapidly throughout the world and a man in order to guarantee his family safety is tasked to locate the origin of the outbreak and assist in finding a cure.Without drawing comparison to Max Brooks' novel, World War Z's impact has been slightly numbed but the influx and saturation of zombie/virus films churned out over recent years. Nevertheless, under Marc Forster's direction WWZ is epic in scale with its sweeping scope and impressive special effects. Forster wisely focuses on Brad Pitt who is superb as ex UN official and family man Gerry Lane. Although the film may have benefited from an unknown actor for impact to Pitts credit he adds gravitas to the role as he journeys from one continent to another encountering perils and avoiding hordes of the twitching contaminated. The supporting cast give a solid backbone although no one stands out as being particularly memorable.The reanimated are wonderfully well done, menacing and for the most part scary - especially in numbers. The limited makeup design on show is excellently crafted, although there's explosions, fire fights the gore is limited and the film is not necessarily blatantly horrific as one would expect - this works both for and against depending on your expectations. That said, there's enough action and tension to keep the causal viewer happy. For the harden zombie fans there's atmosphere, finely executed visuals, memorably the immense birds eye views of the swarming population like ants and a calibre of realism not found in the majority of films this genre.With a genuine on location feel and despite being reminiscent of 28 Days/Weeks later with fast infected Forster delivers a globe trotting disaster flick with less deliberate rough edges. The communication between the infected is interesting, including their dormant state. What also works at times is an old school horror approach, there's lots of moments where the sound design leaves it to the viewers imagination. Notably though the editing and screenplay does pander to the masses, offering paint by numbers solutions and outcomes. For example the Israel segment (filmed in Malta) takes a little too long for Gerry to hone in on the noise leaving the viewer too much time to digest and anticipate what's going to happen next which robs the scene of much of its intended impact and tension. Nevertheless, the Moscow heroic like ending was infamously re-shot for a more quieter, personal closing and Gerry wife's fidelity left intact, which in my mind works better, more true to Gerry's every man personality and the set up that came before.All in all the apocalyptic vision is a solid, realistic and heartfelt entry if somewhat too late (in a saturated genre) to achieve greatness. Let's hope for a sequel that surpasses this with Pitt on board again.","17 out of 29 found this helpful.

It had me on the edge of my seat for nearly 3/4 of the film and served up a good dose of Zombie escapism. It had more than its fair share of mistakes and missed opportunities- but as a fast paced bit of ""the world goes to hell"" this is actually great. And this was just going to be a Zombie movie nothing more. It's not a Brad Pitt movie- his acting was appalling- wooden and stunted at important moments, but that's somewhat forgivable as the action does keep up a decent pace.It's obviously been a long time since Thelma and Louis because Mr Jolie is looking a bit ragged around the edges. The plot is completely unrealistic- however this film has cleverly shown what a 2 hour movie should be for escapist movie goers- outlandish plot turns and global travelling that would make Richard Branson go weak at the knees. But that is the whole point of any fun flick- it's not reality and therefore we can actually use our imagination and go with the unexpected turns. It is kind of ironic that the movie isn't realistic- well no, it's about Zombies and they are made up.... Some of the missed opportunities include dramatic moments with planes that could have done with a bit more ""2012""-the movie panoramic CGI- it could of turned this into a great movie. The dialogue seems to occur in batches. There were a couple of brilliant dialogue moments, but that was it. However by keeping the dialogue down it turned the movie into more of a visual feast then what we are used to. I wonder if anyone will notice this. And if it marks a turning point in CGI films that are more visually based as a genre. If you want good dialogue then go read Shakespeare or Ibsen. The lack of blood was unsettling- but then considering the budget hit $200 million I'm not surprised they need all the family friendly tickets they can sell. I'm not a big fan of blood- I find suspense far more enthralling so this made a surprising change. However I am not sure it will work for die-hard Zombie fans. And there are some things that just should not be messed with. It's obvious somebody has watched 28 Weeks Later- however the mass Zombie hordes set a new benchmark for sphincter clenching madness. And the rather subtle revealing of how the Zombies operate (I don't want to spoil it) is actually quite intelligent and kept to just the right tempo. It's nice to see a Zombie film with a bit of thoughtfulness. Do not read the wiki listed drama until after you have seen the film (it will just distract you from enjoying the way out moments- because you may be thinking ""oh this is what they were talking about"") - but then do go read the diabolical mess some fool/s got themselves into over this film- it's hilarious. It also helps explain why so many people are gossiping badly about this film. It is far better than people are saying. It's over the top, a lot of fun and I am sure will be very popular as a DVD because it does have some great CGI moments. Die-hard Zombie fans- maybe not so much.","14 out of 20 found this helpful.

There are some genuine, high-quality scare moments that will make you jump. The infected look creepy as hell, yet realistically believable. THIS COULD HAPPEN RIGHT NOW. THERE COULD BE A HUMAN-ZOMBIE TIDAL WAVE OF BODIES FLOWING DOWN THE STREET OUTSIDE YOUR JOB RIGHT NOW, WAITING TO ENGULF YOU AS SOON AS YOU TAKE YOUR FIRST STEP OUTSIDE. AND IT WOULD LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THIS. Visually, it is beautiful in its realism, and gives you an idea of how an outbreak like this would actually look in a huge city. Combine that with Brad Pitt bringing his A-game, and you've got yourself a good time.As a zombie movie, there are some things to notice. Typically, your zombie falls into 1 of 2 categories - slower and stupid (your Walking Dead - Resident Evil type), and fast and animal-like (Left 4 Dead, Zombieland, Dawn of the Dead). World War Z goes with type 2, clearly the worse of the two choices in terms of survival, but best in terms of an intense, action-horror movie.Now, this being a zombie movie at its core, there are a couple of clichés that even Brad Pitt can't avoid, like the mass looting of the surviving population, the fact that huge, technologically advanced cities and governments can't figure out how to keep a damn virus from wrecking everything, or the...ugh, going any further with this is a spoiler. Just know that there'll be one point where you'll say, ""there's always THAT guy..."" But still, these are very minor complaints in an otherwise beautifully done movie.Some people might take issue with the lack of blood or gore, but in all honesty, I was so deep into the story and suspense that I forgot this was PG-13.World War Z is a great modern day zombie flick, and a great movie all-around. The 3D is beautiful, but this movie is going to be beautiful either way, so that's really your preference. 9 out of 10 on the BDBOS. Go see it!!!

So you can say I wasn't expecting much, even though there was a lot of hype for this movie.The main complaint behind this movie is that it is PG-13, which means it has minimal blood/gore. What this movie lacks in that aspect it makes up for it in thrill. You feel like you are on the edge of your seat the entire movie. There are also many scenes that will make you jump, the movement of the zombies is also quite frightening.The movie wasn't too predictable and this is one of my complaints about most movies, typically natural disaster movies where no matter what at the end of the movie, it's ""happily ever after"". Up until the end you didn't know what was going to happen, although a few hints were dropped into the movie at previous points.

On his mission he must travel across the globe trying to see what might work in the human's defense of the zombies. I'll admit upfront that I haven't read the book that this film is based on so I can't comment on if it butchered the book or if the film got it right. That aspect of the conversation just doesn't bother me but what does bother me is that we've got an insanely high budget and yet they couldn't work out some sort of interesting story. For the most part we just see Brad Pitt going from one beautiful location to the next and we see that the once beautiful place is now full of zombies. Every once in a while Mr. Pitt has to walk through dark hallways and what really hurts the film is that these sequences just aren't scary. In fact, I'm going to say it right out loud that there wasn't a single scary moment to be found in this picture and the entire ""disaster"" aspect of what was going on just didn't work for me. Never did I feel that the world was really coming to an end and this is a big-budget that can't pull this off yet look at what someone like Romero did in no money. Another problem is that the zombies are all rather bland whether they're real effects or the majority of them CGI. They're not scary, no creative and the lack of gore shouldn't be bashed because you don't need gore to be scary but at the same time when you have the violence off-screen it just makes the film seem rather childish. Pitt offers a nice performance but this is certainly far from his best. It was nice seeing David Morse and the rest of the supporting players are good as well. I don't know what was wrong with the final third of the movie where they had to go back and film a new one but what we got here just doesn't work as its too slow and boring. WORLD WAR Z, sadly, is delivered as a very disappointing movie no matter if you're familiar with the original source or not.","117 out of 251 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A great popcorn movie. Marc Forster delivers a true world war against zombies, with locations in several countries and literally thousands and thousands of bloodthirsty undead","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9108467/?ref_=tt_urv","fernandoschiavi","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33162918/?ref_=tt_urv","8 June 2023","Directed by the versatile Marc Forster, responsible for works as disparate as Finding Neverland (2004) and 007 - Quantum of Solace (2008), the film bets on grandeur as its greatest differential, presenting - as the title says - a true world war against zombies, with locations in several countries and literally thousands and thousands of bloodthirsty undead. The cutscenes are impressive. Unafraid to use aerial shots, exactly with the intention of conveying this epic scale, and computer graphics, Forster creates visually appalling moments, with hordes of creatures scaling giant walls and dominating entire cities. They are some of the most fantastic moments zombie cinema has ever produced. The director presents us with an efficient American summer popcorn movie, with some legitimately excellent scenes. The first of these is the opening sequence of 25 or 30 minutes, in which we see Gerry and his family (wife and two daughters) desperately fleeing the contagion in Philadelphia. This entire sequence, which wastes no time getting started, is extremely tense, with genuine horror movie undertones.Sadly, though, ""World War Z"" offers little beyond that. From the first minutes, the spectator already realizes that he is facing a film that will not worry too much about history or characters: there is only a short scene in which Brad Pitt's family is presented and, soon after, the mindless rush has already begun. Start. From then on, truth be told, Forster manages to imbue the work with a breakneck pace, reducing the most intimate moments to a minimum. ""World War Z"" jumps from one action scene to another without much parsimony, with the characters - and, consequently, the film itself - always in motion, which guarantees energy and dynamism.The film's three-act structure is marked by six main action sequences, well-executed and different from each other, designed to not only keep the viewer on the edge of their seat, but also move the story forward. In the most striking attack, as Palestinians and Israelis finally put aside their territorial and religious differences, a brainless mob turns a celebration of peace into carnage, in a sad parallel with the real world. The direction gives the tape a frantic rhythm, something that mirrors the ferocity of its creatures. Don't expect slow monsters here, but real rabid animals, capable of anything for ""food"" and imbued with the mentality of an uncontrolled mob. Forster's camera, during the first two acts of the narrative, rarely approaches the zombies, avoiding detailing their faces, showing them from afar as uncontrolled and faceless crowds. At these points in the narrative, the face of the ""zekes"" is focused only in a punctual way, almost always in extremely short shots, aiming to scare the audience (especially with the use of 3D). Already in the third act, when Gerry already has a greater ""familiarity"" with the zombies and the story itself calls for a greater exploration of them, Foster allows himself some medium shots focused on the zombies, valuing the make-up work carried out by his team, risking even a quick subjective plane. Note also the absence of blood or gore in the film, which prefers to invest more in suspense than in shock (and the fact that the absence of these elements reduces the indicative rating of the production is also not a mere coincidence).Because of this, the story focuses a lot on the personality of its protagonist. The film quickly establishes Gerry's personality, his care for his daughters and the relationship of complicity with his wife. Also in an economical way, his professional qualities are soon exposed, showing his intelligence and capacity to adapt quickly to the different problems that are presented to him. Brad Pitt, the only star of the project, is always up to the role, transmitting the sense of urgency that the role asks for and never transforms Gerry into an invincible figure, giving him enough vulnerability to make us worry about his fate. The character's line of reasoning is always accurate and we follow his decision process, which never seems forced by the script.Through Gerry's relationship with the other characters, the importance of concepts such as love, loyalty and kindness is questioned. Even with these supporting actors not being explored in a deeper way, they are far from being mere pieces of meat to be sacrificed to the zombie for the sake of the audience's enjoyment. In this sense, the main female figures in the film stand out. Mireille Enos, like Gerry's strong wife, Karin, conveys through looks and half-words all the complicity that their marriage carries. Daniella Kertesz lives the brave Israeli soldier who accompanies the protagonist and ends up stealing some scenes with her attitudes. The experienced David Morse also has a short participation in the scene, which became remarkable thanks to his eccentric performance as a CIA agent.However, ""World War Z"" lacks repetition. From the opening sequence, what we see is it happening again and again only in different countries, with different supporting actors and on ever-increasing scales. The episodic character of the film is extremely latent with this, with little effective impulse to the narrative. This problem is especially obvious in the gigantic sequence in Jerusalem (the one with the undead mountain that is shown exhaustively in the trailers and posters). Though original and technically very good, it is ultimately thrust into the script in a completely implausible manner, even within the fantastic structure of the narrative. The justification for the construction of the wall, the very existence of the wall and the events since Gerry's arrival are funny, such is their improbability.If, on the one hand, the work does not drag on, on the other hand, this almost exclusive focus on action also results in an emotionally sterile experience for the audience. The screenplay, written by Matthew Michael Carnahan, Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof (all with good work in film and television) and adapted from a book by Max Brooks, seems to have been written on total autopilot. There is no attempt to make the audience really know Gerry Lane and his family to the point of being interested or concerned about them. Not only are the moments shared between them few, since the protagonist is separated from the family right at the beginning, but also all the scenes that could generate some dramatic impact seem to have been cut or treated in a sloppy way, such as the woman leaving and of their daughters on the ship. As a result, the experience of watching zombie attacks becomes purely visual, without ever causing any kind of tension or feeling.In addition, the script still suffers from a lack of development, or at least a lack of goodwill on the part of the writers. Gerry's investigation, for example, is incredibly easy and superficial: all he has to do is get somewhere and the first person he talks to already has information about the epidemic. And the fact that no one knew where it all started, what does it look like? In fact, ""World War Z"", more than just a movie without much intelligence, is a movie that doesn't respect the viewers' intelligence. At a certain point, in the moment of the protagonist's epiphany, Forster and his writers prefer to show scenes and lines previously seen, in a literal and unnecessary representation, as if the audience was not able to understand what the character discovered. As if that weren't enough, the plot is still full of holes and inconsistencies (what end did the boy Tomas' parents take, for example? By the way, what is his function in the story anyway? And throwing a grenade inside a plane? Seriously?) and, contrary to most productions of the genre, does not seek to use zombies as a metaphor or allegory for some social commentary; they're people eaters, that's all. And didn't Carnahan, Goddard and Lindelof realize that cutting off a limb to prevent the infection from spreading was seen on ""The Walking Dead""?""World War Z"" also promotes an update of the figure of the zombie, something that had already occurred in 28 Days Later (2002). In Danny Boyle's film, the living dead are no longer slow, affected by rigor mortis, and unintelligent as we see in George A. Romero's classics. By the hands of the British, they became agile, smart and potentially deadly. Now, World War Z proposes a new generation of zombies: from a contamination that occurs in seconds, they became extremely fast, acting as a deadly amorphous mass that takes over streets, climbs walls and takes over everything, giving little chance of defense. However, much of this new generation of the undead is created digitally, which takes away some of the scenic impact traditionally provided by tons of makeup, blood, costumes and other tangible elements. Even so, the tension and dread these new zombies provoke is very real. These are feelings that refer both to our most primitive fears and to a fear related to the fall of the State and the advent of global social chaos. The zombie apocalypse echoes not only the hideous figure of the cannibal undead, but also the feeling of an uncertain, anarchic future filled with varied privations. In this skeptical scenario, wild individualism becomes the prevailing order.And it's worth a last comment, this time about the lack of blood in the entire film. Considering this is a zombie tape, it was a financial choice to gain lower ratings and reach more audiences, but one that doesn't fit with the spirit of this type of work. As a result, deaths, even those of zombies, happen off-screen, some with well-thought-out solutions, others quite simplistic. It doesn't quite spoil the movie, but it distracts in the wrong way.

Straight to the point with the action. I would have like a LITTLE more backstory besides ""an ex member of the United Nations"" because Gerry gets all this special treatment throughout the film because of his previous job, yet they never really explained exactly what he did. Big budget! Some zombie scenes you could obviously tell were CGI but overall impressive and I love how large of a scope this movie paints. Chaos all over the world and you get to see it all instead of just cheap news story exposition. Try to avoid trailers if you already haven't see them, and go in blind, and with an open mind.

SCIENCE-FICTION THRILLER DRAMA SUSPENSEIdea based on the popular novel written by Max Brooks whose the son of comedic films Mel Brooks of ""The Producers"" which showcases something I've never seen before, and that is the start of the evolution regarding the zombie virus which this film is like a reminiscent of a prequel of ""28 Days Later"", ""Dawn Of The Dead"", ""Zombieland"" or ""I Am Legend"" to name a few since those movies centers on the aftermath -never before. From what I've remembered from watching the previews, they either didn't tell nor explain me anything. The only thing I remembered from the previews is that Brad Pitt is the star but don't quite know what role he has in this film except that the direction must be something different I've never seen before. The reason I say this is because the scene from the preview where he's with his family in the car when all of that excitement was happening occurred right at the beginning. Because almost right away, someone becomes infected and we get to witness how long it would take a human being to turn into a zombie and that is being observed by Gerry Lane played by Brad Pitt because he is a doctor(but according to ET Weekly he's a strategic army man) as he's trying to escape with his family. New York City is being ravaged by this zombie epidemic and is spreading recklessly at a uncontrollable ration as more and more people are infected where it's even worst than the plague but instead of rats we get zombies. Only a few glimpse of human people are left and are eventually going to succumb to this epidemic as well, except that we are invested by Pitts family and no one else's, making other peoples lives unfortunate but less sympathetic. And because he used to work for the gov't, he once had an important position that most other people don't have, and it is during at that time that is going to guarantee him and his family safety not optioned to anyone nor to many other people. To say anymore would be pointless as the Brad Pitt character is going through many close calls similar to what a real nightmare would look like. Although, this film had many rewrites and postpone dates upon the movies release, I find that it's Brad Pitt's persona is what is holding this film together as it's like a mirror image of his own family since he cares about his wife and daughters as well as take another kid under his wing and will do whatever it takes to guarantee their safety. He plays a family man and we can identify with him since it's built to also be a part of his dilemma in the decisions that he makes as a human being and you don't get to see that happen to often much in zombie movies very much no matter how many zombie films you have seen already.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

When Gerry Lane, a former UN worker is tasked to help a scientist travel across the planet to discover a cure for the rapidly growing zombie infection, he also is troubled by leaving his family behind while the world around him collapses into chaos.Directed by Marc Forster, WWZ is easily one of the most entertaining and epic zombie films ever made. Now this being said, many zombie fanatics will disagree, I know this, as some think you need bloody/gory violence and flesh-tearing. This movie proves otherwise, and the zombies here are among the most frightening zombies I've ever seen, being very reminiscent of the ""rage-infused"" zombies of 28 Days Later. Brad Pitt is at his A-Game here, being both believable as a father and an unsung hero. Mireille Enos was great as Karin Lane, being the very sensitive, but careful mother who knows how to deal with the situation instead of screaming her head off when zombies are at her back. The cinematography is absolutely stunning and breath-taking, especially after the incredible plane crash sequence. The music by Marco Beltrami is award-worthy, capturing both the horrific atmosphere of a collapsing world and human drama of what we're capable of in such disastrous times. The script, though, while well-written, went from being Oscar-material, to a normal blockbuster script that (happily) doesn't insult your intelligence, or become stupid. But there is plenty of room to make a sequel or two because the story here is much to grand for one film.Overall, World War Z is one of the best blockbusters of the year, with good acting, directing, and polished visuals that have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. I would have to say, this is one of Brad Pitt's best films","96 out of 176 found this helpful.

Depending on what mood I'm in, I'll either give it the better score or the lower. Today, I'm willing to give it the better score. In a decade where we have The Walking Dead and other popular zombie films, World War Z tries to set itself apart from the rest by injecting action set pieces rather than pure horror. The globe is hit with a pandemic, a virus that if contracted within 12 seconds you'll be turned into a 'zombie'. The dreaded Z word that strikes fear into the heart of many...except our protagonist's family who seems to be calmer than most oceans. Like seriously, zombies are ravaging people in the middle of New York City and they are so cool and calm it's as if they witness this everyday! But yes, this is a typical zombie formula where we go from point A to B to C and to D in order to find answers. Along the way, the film is fuelled by exhilarating set pieces ranging from New York City, raining South Korea and dusty Jerusalem. It's utterly watchable and does keep me captivated for its entire runtime. Despite the atrocious human visual effects for the hordes of zombies (which...is just horrendously bad), I like their mannerisms. Little idiosyncrasies like chattering of the teeth, consistent spasms in the arm and, my favourite, nose diving off buildings. Zombie missiles as such, minus the explosion. Brad Pitt holds every scene in a quieter performance than usual. His wit has been substituted for focus and fear simultaneously, and it works. Liked the members of WHO but all over cast members were wasted. What I cannot stand are the huge amount of conveniences in the plot. Wherever our main character goes, trouble shortly arrives. Call it bad luck or convenience, it's uninspired and formulaic regardless. I can't shake it off. Having said that, it's enjoyable for what it is. It holds my attention and is well made...just has a few niggles that I can't forgive.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

"9","/10","The EOW genre is constantly evolving — there is no reason why this film should be limited in terms of narrative scope","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2817422/?ref_=tt_urv","aequus314","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur39829877/?ref_=tt_urv","21 June 2013","tl;dr - Set aside expectations related to the zombie genre and enjoy World War Z as a disaster popcorn flick.**********Max Brook's muscular, world weary ""oral history of the zombie war"", a thinly veiled geo-political mouthpiece on the world at large seen through the eyes of an agent working for the UN, has taken shape and form through a movie of the same name — World War Z. But make no mistake about both being made from the same mold.Rather than pander to the novel's ambitious fictional output of global perspectives (survivors from virtually every continent on Earth were interviewed by the novel's narrator) — this summer flick directed by Marc Forster (Quantum of Solace, Finding Neverland, Stranger than Fiction) is sensibly scaled down on politicking and military machismo. With a tried and tested sci-fi disaster formula, the result works fairly well on its own terms. Vastly different from Brook's scathing, testosterone driven bestseller and the archetypal zombie gore fest; this latest End-of-World extravaganza is less tired and less verbose. By virtue of that, translates to a much more engaging experience.********** Brief Synopsis: After decades of living in risky, high-stakes existence as a UN investigator; Gerry Lane (Pitt) is now comfortably retired to a cozy, domestic life in Philadelphia with loving wife, Karen (Mireille Enos) and two young daughters. Problem is that a mysterious virus has spiraled out of control and gone global, resulting in a win-win proposition from former colleague Thierry -- the state guarantees refuge and protection for Gerry's family in exchange for his unrivaled field expertise. Thus we are immediately whisked to the main exposition -- Gerry, accompanied by the Navy SEAL and a virologist (developing the vaccine) traverses international borders in search of patient zero -- the journey spans South Korea and Israel, to the WHO in Wales and eventually Canada. Trivia: The novel places origin of the zombie outbreak in Dachang, Hebei. Incidentally, the film hypothesizes with narratives about the spread of SARS as a deadly epidemic. It can therefore be understood, that the virus in WWZ is implied to have begun in Northern China.**********It is no controversy that World War Z is plagued with production troubles and the screenplay has undergone a few re-writes, but manifestations of this in film authorship isn't grave or jarring. To the contrary; Forster's version has softened Brook's high-minded hyperbole in exchange for a modest, grounded and back-to-basics approach — this makes for undeniable commercial appeal.Visually, after a cumbersome and erratically edited zombie rampage sequence in the first act, DP Ben Seresin (Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen) and special effects rebound with impressive large scale photography. The outbreak of zombie hordes in Jerusalem's disaster sequence deserve mention — it is here that the narrative's kinesthetic urgency receives a healthy dose of adrenaline. Action aficionados will be pleased. Seresin's chaotic apocalypse overrun by waves of running undeads is also given counterweight by a quiet, noble dimension found in Gerry's measured and cool-in-crisis stoicity. Brad Pitt's iconic persona as a humanitarian in real life, may very well have influenced his portrayal of Gerry, infusing the kind of personality and screen image that transforms naturally in a Hollywood film.But the cleverest stroke in characterization, is that of Israeli soldier Segen (Daniella Kertesz). A sound approach in keeping characters fresh and creative is that material be produced with caveats in mind. Flat, boilerplate stereotypes of women being one example of many. For this reason, I was surprised to discover that much of the film's feistier, more relevant survivalist moments originate from her flair for timing and intuition.All being said, preconceived notions about what zombie films should and ought to be have divided zombie lovers into two main groups. Fans of Romero's classics may prefer depictions of slow-moving zombies (Night of the Living Dead, The Walking Dead), while others embrace the idea of super sprinters (28 Days Later, 2004 Dawn of the Dead). The good news is that this debate, when filtered through the lens of a global disaster flick, becomes irrelevant (or less so). I guess my point is the EOW genre is constantly evolving, there is no reason why this film should be limited in terms of narrative scope. The only real complaint is an excessively dramatized, prolonged exchange between an infected doctor and Gerry in the film's final act. You get less awkward, more authentic moments between Rick Grimes and the bicycle zombie girl back in Atlanta. But that's another apocalypse.cinemainterruptus.wordpress.com","102 out of 190 found this helpful.

"","","Family outing ruined by zombie plague.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2819930/?ref_=tt_urv","guchrisc","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur39929622/?ref_=tt_urv","25 June 2013","What is it!, with fathers? Tom Cruise, almost as soon as he is in charge of his kids, gets caught up in a Martian invasion, in 'War of the Worlds' (2005). Here, Brad Pitt cannot even drive his kids down the road without being swept up in a world-wide zombie plague.This reviewer was offered a choice of 2D and 3D, and decided if the film was good enough it would stand on it's own merits in the 2D format. It did.Film comes from Brad Pitt's own 'Plan B Entertainment' film company and was released via 'Paramount', therefore Brad Pitt is a producer and the film opens with the 'Paramount Mountain'. The rest of the credits are shown with quick views of US urban scenes and TV. Views are partially distorted by clever graphics. Scenes are typical and pleasant. About halfway through though, this reviewer was disturbed to see a few brief seconds of Piers Morgan, and after that the scenes became more sinister, ending with prophecies of doom.The mood changes though when the film proper starts. We are in a suburban house with Gerry and his family. Gerry is played by Brad Pitt. We quickly find out, thanks partially to the TV, that Gerry is a house-husband and that his most important job is making pancakes, however his old job was a lot more dangerous and involved him travelling to dangerous places around the world.After breakfast, Gerry and his family drive through down-town Philadelphia and get caught up in a traffic-jam. They also get caught up as a swarm of zombies engulf this part of town. These scenes are very intense, the pace slackens only after some time, and only then did this reviewer notice their own very accelerated heart-beat.Around St Valentine's Day there was a nice little Rom-com zombie film called 'Warm Bodies', that told the heart-warming story of love conquering all, including zombies. 'World War Z' is not that film. 'WWZ' rather is a fast action horror and thriller (which also makes a few interesting little political points). The only thing that 'WWZ' shares with 'WB' is regarding the speed of the zombies. If, dear reader, your own previous experience of zombies, extends no further than the slow lumbering clumsy zombies, populating the shopping mall, in George A. Romero's 1978 'Dawn of the Dead', (one of a trilogy), then be prepared to be shocked and scared. Like the bonys in 'WB', these zombies can move, and run, very fast indeed. Again, unlike 'DOTD', the gestation period for developing into a zombie is much shortened too in 'WWZ'.The film starts in Philadelphia but there are also scenes of different parts of the world. In reality however many scenes were actually shot in the UK. Most of the opening scenes were shot in Glasgow, Scotland, UK; mostly in and around, George Square. Glasgow, like many North American cities, has a grid-system street layout. So it is then that in a ten minute walk from 'down-town Philly' you can come to the street in 'San Francisco', (this reviewer had always thought ""San Francisco!"" for many years), where Halle Berry did some filming for 'Cloud Atlas'. Glasgow also has some interesting buildings that could help it pass for many a European city. Previously the Council's City Chambers on George Square have stood in for the Vatican (in 'Heavenly Pursuits'), as well as the Kremlin (in 'An Englishman Abroad').Some have thought the pace slowed later in the film. This reviewer disagrees. The danger from zombies is always there. It would be ridiculous if this film was just one long chase scene. The film starts, like 'War of the Worlds' with the family caught up in the situation, however unlike that film (which seemed to spend half the time in one cellar, and the rest in the US country-side), this film moves around a lot more, various countries are seen. Seen too are the zombies, who are ready, able, and willing, to chase throughout the film, and do too.Brad Pitt should be rightly proud of this very exciting and scary zombie film, (rated 15 in the UK), that he has produced and starred in. If you liked 'War of the Worlds' or you like zombie films then you will enjoy this. Top marks. 10/10.Health Warning: Beware of zombies! They tend to bite and their bite is usually fatal. When being chased by a zombie, or even seeing zombies moving, you may experience an accelerated heart-beat. Most importantly, take all the necessary precautions you can to avoid being bitten.","26 out of 50 found this helpful.

These are not the traditional slow moving, flesh tearing zombies reminiscent of the Walking Dead walkers or the more classical types. It's zombies v2.0, the faster ones, featured in Resident Evil 5 (the game) and the creatures from I Am Legend. So if you consider this expectation or aspect, then your experience with this movie might be different.The severe lack of blood and biting also makes this movie depart from the classical sense. After all that's said and done, I actually did find this movie 'refreshing' from the usual zombie apocalypse movies. You didn't have large groups of people with a set of melodramatic characters who are quick to whine about every decision made by the group. There is also no cases of a group holed up in any place and surviving the apocalypse. Therefore, there's very less of the older zombie movie formula.If, like me, you've got a good dose of classic zombie or zombie v1.0, then you might find this movie refreshing. Add to that, there are quite a number of intense moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat. There is also another interesting aspect that this film handles which is rarely ever dealt with in classic zombie flicks. I can't give that part away without revealing a spoiler.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

I think the film's main fault is that it does nothing new with the monster. These are basically the same zombies we saw in 28 Days/Weeks Later, except they kind of drop the whole virus angle fairly shortly in and just admit they're dealing with the undead. The plot has a U.N. operative (Brad Pitt) traversing the world trying to figure a way out of the crisis. Pitt is excellent. There are some fantastic set pieces, and the film moves extremely quickly. I'd call it more suspense than horror here - I do think the PG-13-ization hurts the film a bit. I'm not a huge gore guy, but the constant cutting away from any violence starts to get old after a while. I wonder if there'll be an R-rated director's cut on video - that might be a better film. The actual solution to the problem is pretty lame, and not especially believable. I must say, Marc Forster does a fine job here as director. After Quantum of Solace, no one in their right mind should have let him near an action movie again. He proves himself quite capable, though. I'd recommend this, though maybe not that strongly.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

I went to see this movie with good feelings about it but with a bit of doubt. The movie starts slow for about 5-10 minutes max then speed up a bit then kicks in. The strength of this movie is not the action it is the atmosphere you are always asking yourself what could happen what you hope won't happen. The characters are well played, smart brilliant, not that they are all genius but they act like real human would. They don,t go running all over the place screaming for no good reason when they know that if they make too much noise they will get in big trouble. The reaction from the characters are realistic. You care for the characters you encounter throughout the movie. The scenario is great, I have not read the book from Max Brooks which this movie is the adaptation but this movie is well written and you never really know what's gonna happen, of course you often predict what happens but when you think about the possibilities they are so numerous that you don't say ""OK so now the only possible thing that'll happen is this...OK I knew it"" their is always a myriad of possibilities. The movie is not a gore fest it is not full of guts or dismembered limbs at every 2 steps. The movie is creepy, even scary when you put yourself in the place of the characters boots. When the movie ended I was speechless, I see a lot of movies, I love independent films like Exit Humanity, but this movie WOW, I will go see it next week end and maybe the next too and maybe the next too. I only did this for 2 movies and they were 1. The Lord of the Rings : Fellowship of the ring 2. Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers.I hope that my review helped some of you, i give this movie a 10 out of 10 and can't wait to see it another time. Also I hope it does pretty well at the box office so there could be a sequel, it would be really awesome and great if there is a sequel and that it is done with the quality and efforts that the ones who were put into this movie.","15 out of 23 found this helpful.

Movies where the viewer can't even begin to imagine the horror lend an excitement that's only available in modern zombie horror, in my humble opinion. World War Z also has it's share of predictable moments, but without giving anything away, you will still enjoy the film. I am not really saying much with this review only to say that if you like zombie, you will truly dig World War Z!","16 out of 25 found this helpful.

"7","/10","So much better than most zombie films, but still only average.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2819880/?ref_=tt_urv","siderite","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3146136/?ref_=tt_urv","25 June 2013","There are some things that you get to feel in your bones after watching a lot of movies, one of those feelings that something is wrong at places. I have not read the book the film is based on, but I was having these spider-sense tinglings that some scenes could not have been in the book.Also, the plot reminded me too much of a book I hated with all my heart: The Passage, by Justin Cronin. It starts with character building scenes mingled smartly with action and suspense, than Blam! Reset! A lot of crafty special effects follow that last more than the character building scenes, then there are no characters left. All but the main character get to move to the next stage. Then it starts all over again. It does this at least three times. It gets old and annoying.You have to see this from my perspective: I've watched movies like 28 Hours Later, where complex characters and spooky music create a truly horrorful atmosphere. I've seen things like Night of the Living Dead, filled with social commentary that made the film interesting beside the moving corpses. I have seen films that use plot devices like crammed spaces to build up what they can't possibly build with their allotted budget. The problem with World War Z is that is it perfectly made, tons of special effects, many locations, scary running zombies (in hordes!), but the story is the same lame ""lone hero does all the work and saves the day"". In 3D, no less!This can be felt painfully in the last scenes, when really well known and good British and German and Italian actors play secondary roles that anyone could have played. It was like a weird twist on the Statue of Liberty text: give us your best and we'll give them mediocre roles, because we have the budget.Bottom line: so much better than most zombie films, but still only average. I know it seems contradictory, but that's how I feel about it. I will read the book only to see if I was right feeling that all those extra scenes were off somehow.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

I watched this with an open mind that it may be ""altered"" to be more entertaining as a movie.Still thought it was way too far off from the book to even have the name ""World War Z"". If they were going to change this much, there was no need to use WWZ. To people who don't know the book, they won't care. To those who do, they will be insulted by the movie. Isn't the whole point of adapting a book to a movie, based on the fact that the book was a success? Thus implying that a good portion of your target audience are the book readers. So why intentionally slap the readers in the face? It makes no sense when you watch this movie, since it probably resembles 20% or less of the book's story, concept and characters.Even with the book differences, I could have lived with this movie being a solid zombie movie if the movie was actually about zombies. The ""infected"" may be fast and united, but the movie is pg-13 and that is just baffling. How can you possibly expect to make a movie like this and limit yourself with a pg-13 in an attempt to sell more tickets to kids? That's pretty much trading quality for quantity...or ""selling out"".It was hard enough to watch this and hardly see any resemblance of the source material that was amazing, but then you are also limited to pg-13 action and violence for a movie of this nature. There was almost no blood, diluted violence, bad CGI and annoying ""cut-away"" action scenes. Very disappointing.","182 out of 369 found this helpful.

One Spec Ops put his foot forward to find the reason and try getting an answer for it. Its powerful as an content, fun for action lovers as things keep happening which doesn't allow any Loo Breaks for audience.Zombies are on an roll this time as they are fast, senses details very fast and are hungry for living body. Brad pitt is great as usual.The movie begins with a short intro to the main character and his family (it was enough, it told me all I needed to know) before launching into a fantastic, break neck sequence that establishes the pace for most of the rest of the movie. It's violent, visceral and shocking without any reliance in gore. The tension is racked up (especially in the escape from the apartment block sequence) with a series of spectacular set pieces (the walls of Jerusalem scene is brilliant) and things get better and bigger until the film slows the pace for the final reel with a slow burning, smaller scale sequence set in a WHO research lab in the UK. It's an unusual choice to end a movie with the smallest set piece, but it worked well for me as it was in line with Gerry's quest and the (stated in the movie) fact that the answer is often so small it gets overlooked. World War Z is perfect masala entertainer. Prefer watching it in 2-D as there is no room for 3-D.Cheers !!!","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

"6","/10","A great action movie, but far from perfect...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2830725/?ref_=tt_urv","paul_haakonsen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22654354/?ref_=tt_urv","13 July 2013","Well, as much as ""World War Z"" was hyped up and as it was the summer's big zombie movie, and me being the zombie aficionado that I am, of course I had to go watch it.The movie, however, left me somewhat ambivalent. There were aspects and parts of the movie that were really great and nice, while other aspects and parts of the movie were quite the opposite.First, let me start off with the things that I didn't particularly cared much for. The biggest issue for me was, of course, the running zombies. I never have cared much for agile and running zombies, nor will I ever get to do so. Sure, I can understand it in this movie as the infected was recently turned. But that leads me to the second issue in the movie which I didn't appreciate or understand. If everything here happened in the course of 2-3 days and the zombies were ""fresh"" (read, recently turned), then how come they all looked emancipated and like they had been decaying and decomposing for about 2-3 weeks? It just didn't make any sense.Also the massive pile ups of zombies as they stacked up to scale the walls in Israel of the sides of towering apartment buildings, that didn't really go well with me. Sure it looked cool and it was a new concept idea to bring to the genre. But come on, it was just too much.Without giving away anything of the ending of the movie, then it was really, really anti-climatic. It was like the movie producers realized that they were over the estimated time-slot and budget and had to wrap it up quickly. The ending was abrupt and too much of a happy Hollywood ending.So what was good about the movie? Well, there was an overload of action, right from the very first minutes and up to the very end. There is a lot of adrenaline and speed to the movie. And it worked out well with the panoramic views of the various cities, when you saw all the infected running around in massive hordes. It was on an epic scale actually. I loved those scenes (eventhough I can't stand running zombies). They looked awesome and there was just something dark about them and a sense of looming doom.The scenes in Philadelphia and Israel were fantastic, they really made good use of the locations and the cinematography here. Great shots and a good sense of panic here in the scenes. However, when the movie went to Korea it was a bit anti-climatic. The military airport in Korea came off as something from a distant era. It was all dark and in small, enclosed areas most of the time. You didn't really have the sense of this was a military area in one bit. And when the movie took us to the viral facility in Ireland, well that was just great. Sure, it was in sterile rooms and long corridors lit up by florescent lights, but it worked so well.As much as I don't really consider myself a fan of Brad Pitt, then he actually did a good job in this movie. However, there weren't really any over-the-top performances in ""World War Z"" from anyone. People did good jobs with their given roles, but no one in particular stood out. The characters they portrayed, however, tended to come off a one-dimensional and you never really got to the heart and core of any of the characters. As such, they were very impersonal and could just as well just had been hollow caricatures.I am giving ""World War Z"" a 6 out of 10 rating, because it is a good action movie full of adrenaline, but there were gaps and holes in the storyline and continuity here and there. And also the running zombies didn't help to impress me. There are many beautiful scenes and really well-constructed scenes throughout the movie which makes the movie well worth watching. ""World War Z"" appeals to a wide audience, but in its attempt to get out to as many as possible, it fails to cater to the hardcore fans of the zombie genre.I should get around to reading the book, as I have been told that the movie deviates and strays far from the actual book upon which it is based.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Within moments of the start of the film, the unknown threat is upon the protagonist and his family. Very soon, the dimmest outline of the beast come to devour the world is shown. The desperate race to flee, to fight, to combat, to do anything in response to that which exists only in my most symbolic nightmares is on.The Beast moves with speed, fury and determination, but its full dimensions always remains unclear, unknown and terrifying. It hunts, it lurks and it waits for every opportunity to consume mankind. In the face of this unknown devourer, our protagonist carries on with his mission with only the barest glimmer of hope of success or understanding of what he is facing, while all around him the world is consumed.As I left the theatre and made my way home overwhelmed by what I saw, a dream I had long ago that marked me arose. I saw the destroyer of worlds, the unthing, from beyond again, its long grim strides consuming existence with every step. Everything in the destroyer's path was annihilated and was as if it all had never been. No past, no present, no future remained in the wake of the unthing from beyond. The only thing to do was to flee before the end of existence, desperate to cling what remained as nothingness strode towards me.Allegorically, World War Z,with its teeming rivers of once human tentacles of destruction depicted the unthing of my dreams to me. The terrible all consuming horror summoned forth grips me still and I cry and whimper in fear. The destroyer of worlds was evoked in World War Z, as clearly to me as it was to Dr. Oppenheimer when he witnessed the first atomic bomb and the first unthing was put within man's grasp.I knew fear again, the fear that existential horror films rely upon to work and I knew that World War Z had done its job admirably. If you enjoy such films and enjoy glimpses of the destroyer of worlds, this one's for you.","8 out of 11 found this helpful.

It had seemed a little over the top. But when I watched it, everything changed. It was great! You could hardly tell they were zombies from what we perceive to be a 'zombie'. They were incredibly fast and just traveled in gigantic numbers. It really had a totally different take on the horror genre. The movie was almost completely different than the very popular TV show, The Walking Dead. It looked like the movie would have a lot of blood and gore, but it turns out it doesn't, and it really didn't need it, in my opinion. Although, at some parts, I found it completely unrealistic; such as when they were talking about North Korea, I believe, and how they pulled all of their people's teeth out so they would no get infected. But overall, I believed the acting was excellent and Brad Pitt had done very well. This was the definition of a great large budget film.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

Although this movie is not an exact adaptation of the book it still impresses in its portrayal of the zombie apocalypse seen through the eyes of UN employee Gerry Lane (enacted by Brad Pitt). Gerry Lane has been tasked with investigating the outbreak of a virus that turns humans into mindless, angry zombies similar to those infected with the Rage virus (28 Days Later) and pushes mankind towards extinction. The zombies in World War Z are far scarier than any you've ever seen on TV before.The movie starts thrilling right from the very beginning and is fast paced with many startling moments that will keep you on the edge of the seat. I watched it in 3D and I must say that I really enjoyed the effects. There were moments when I reflexively ducked to avoid an undead arm from grabbing my throat! The cast played their characters very well and were complemented with dialogue far more meaningful than your average zombie flick, good screenplay and a very intense soundtrack. This is by far the most realistic and thrilling zombie flick I have seen since 28 Weeks Later and will be on the must watch movies list of this year. Fans of the apocalypse will love it! A thrilling ride for everyone is guaranteed. 8/10 Enjoy!","8 out of 11 found this helpful.

In my opinion, that movie should be R-rated instead of PG-13 rating, because the kills weren't bloody at all and most of them, were done off-screen... It wasn't scary, but there was only one jumpscare, the one in the building (it was totally unexpected and so scary). There were too many intense scenes, and they were very well portrayed.

Actually it is closer in quality and modest believability to 28 Days, with a bit of Contagion, as UN operative Gerry (Brad Pitt) struggles to find the source of the pandemic that is consuming the world. The implausibility of most horror films is built in; the genius of the filmmakers is to make us believe anyway.Unbelievable, yes, ludicrous no, for it speaks even in its grand setups of human vulnerability and the capricious power of Mother Nature. Although 28 Days had a minimalist approach, fewer zombies and more good guys, WWZ has a focus on hero Gerry with close-ups aplenty—but then it's Brad Pitt, who was born to be photographed.The zombie tropes are all there if you're checking: the hero coming out of retirement, the loving family he has to leave to save the world, the unreal transformation of millions into undead monsters, the good guy bitten, and so on. Yet director Marc Foster has assembled the best looking zombie horde to complement his star's good looks. Foster has also depicted thousands of zombies climbing and being shot down in vast groups, and image I have not encountered except in films about Nazi atrocities.The almost two hours are as fast paced as the virus—nary a moment of peace—from transporting Gerry and his family to various safe spots to running from the legions of zombies to finally a relatively quiet World Health Organization lab, where the creatures are ready to stop Gerry from finding their weakness and producing an antidote. The allegorical implications of HIV or chemical warfare are there if you want them. Otherwise, it's just an enjoyable ride along the suspense express.However, I have to admit the pandemic has a ring of truth to it , as if Ma Nature had decide another Black Plague would be good to get the population to reasonable size. For that scenario, see Dan Brown's Inferno. For nothing more than edge-of-your seat thrills, World War Z will do for a good old-fashioned adrenaline rush.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

Plenty of scenes in dark rooms with zombies chomping at a door that won't quite lock. There's an original scene on an airplane. As far as zombie movies go, World War Z will probably not be remembered well (like I Am Legend is not remembered well in the vampire genre). But, it's certainly not a boring film.

Still while reading it I visualized a much different film than what appeared in the first trailers for this film. But in it's long journey to the screen there were rumblings of troubled set reports and than a huge release date shift, never a good sign. So it is indeed surprising that the finished product is as solid as it is, not to say it's flawless by any means. The cinematic adaptation works more as an inspiration than a story base. The girth of the novel is still there. It is a world taken over by the undead. But the creatures in this film are of a different sort. Similar to the fast zombies of 28 days later and the Dawn of the Dead remake these are even more aggressive if you can imagine that. Not only do they run but they dive and jump. The movie like it's zombies possesses an urgency that makes the proceedings work fairly well. Moving from one expertly choreographed action set piece to another as it spans the globe. That being said there is some goofiness here an airplane attack although shocking is a bit silly and some of the zombie moments come across a little unintentionally funny. Still the idea of the zombies moving like a virus swarm through the human body and the defense strategy are impressive and do breathe a bit of life into the concept. As for the human characters they are decent if a little generic Brad Pitt does surprisingly well in the lead giving a depth to his character that is much needed. I only wish they would have slowed down more throughout the film to develop a depth to the material a bit more and amped up the soft ending. But after the massive opening weekend there are now talks of a sequel as it was originally planned as a trilogy. which leaves me a hopeful that they will iron out the few kinks. Still what stands is a solid summer film. Very entertaining and breathtakingly intense. 3.5/5","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Not again.. Reason for that being, is that for the past years all companies whether it's a Movie(pictures) or a Game development company, have been trying to make a zombie hit film/game, and in my opinion almost every single one of them has failed. Of course the hit series ""The walking dead"" Is without a doubt not a failure, more like a huge success. But the fact that there were so many failed games and movies about zombies, roughly made to fit in with the Apocalypse trend in 2012. Made my expectations very very low. Now somehow Marc Forster, managed to have a twist of originality in the common zombie themed movie. Which made me actually like it, I really did. Brad Pitt was of course as expected outstanding, but that wasn't the only thing, the plot actually was good. Now I won't spoil what the original point is in the movie obviously, But I will guarantee you, that you will enjoy watching this. You won't be able to relax throughout the entire film, it's a classic. Every minute will be exciting and entertaining at the same time.So people, want a more realistic view of ""zombies"" ? or you just want to be entertained? Go and see it, I'll promise, it'll be worth the money and time. (obviously it has to be your cup of tea ;P)","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Go in open minded - and hope for a sequel...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2816839/?ref_=tt_urv","inspektorr","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20498393/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2013","Well, I've seen it today in 3D. First of all, I actually didn't mind 3D, although normally I hate it. I guess it's because the movie was obviously made in 2D, so the 3D effects that were added later on didn't really rape my eyes. And there are several of scenes in which 3D really gives you a sense of depth and scale.Oh, I also read both books and knew beforehand that the movie doesn't really follow the storyline.To sum it up: it's a really nice zombie flick.Perhaps a bit too nice, since the aimed PG13 rating hides away something that is a staple of all zombie movies: gore. If you're a gore fan, there's NONE here. I mean zero. This movie is gore-free. Gore is implied, it's part of the storyline, but you don't actually get to see it. Kinda like soft porn.The story follows Gerry Lane, an ex UN investigator who finds himself and his family engulfed in the developing world wide pandemic. The story quickly jumps from a nice family setting into running for their lives and we get a glimpse of how fast this thing is spreading, of the panic that ensues, the collapse of the modern society etc.Gerry's skills as a UN investigator are his get-out-of-jail card, since he is rescued by remaining military forces and sent off with a SEAL team to figure out the source of the infection in order to procure a vaccine.From there on, we follow Gerry around the world and learn little bits of information that help us paint the global disaster that seems to be getting worse by the minute.The action is non-stop. There's really no slow parts, it's a jump from one action packed scene to another and just as we barely catch a breath, the zeeks start pouring over walls, ever eager to take a bite at the closest human.CGI scenes are epic. There's no better way to describe it. We have never seen zombies like this, literally huge pouring masses of them, rolling through cities like an unstoppable river of hungry undead. This is a great concept and it's kind of a shame they showed some of those scenes in the trailer. Still, seeing them again is breathtaking.The ride is really full of thrills, and while some of the plot devices seem too simple, it's easy to understand how hard it is to film a global story like this and still keep it in focus. There's not much time for character development, so except our hero and his family, we don't really get to know much about others. Which is actually also kind of understandable, because, as anyone who's ever been in a war, you basically don't have time to care that much about others. You're looking out for yourself and your closest family. Brad Pitt offers a good performance, as well as the supporting cast.The bad things about WWZ... Well, there are several. First of all, I can't say the screenwriters managed to paint the global picture as much as I'd hoped for. I know it's very hard thing to do, but still. The climax is basically an anti-climax. It's a quiet ending that more then obviously states it's intention to reveal more in the possible sequel.It basically tells us that this is just the begging, it even takes a couple of clear hints from the books, which leads me to believe that if they ever make a sequel, it will follow the books more closely. And I hope they will.The lack of gore is disappointing. We live in a time when there's a split zombie head every week on The Walking Dead. I expected more. Also, I'm not too keen on the concept of super-fast, super-strong zombies. Aforementioned The Walking Dead proved that you can do very impressive stuff even with walkers.The thing that strikes me the most is the fact that in terms of revelations, everything is really, really toned down. There's no epochal findings, there's no grand discoveries, or gotcha scenes, it all sort of happens... Well, like in real life, I suppose. And this is something that is also the underline of the book. While it offers much more details and stories from around the world, it deals with the subject at hand in a basic ""trying to survive"" way.So, in the end, the 116 minutes went by very quickly. I was definitively entertained, scared and left wanting for more in the end. With all that said, I would recommend you do go and see the movie.","11 out of 17 found this helpful.

It starts with a jaw dropping scene of unexplained traffic chassis in New York city, followed by mass evacuation from zombies. Brad Pitt's character then attempts to find out what stated the outbreak, but his efforts (or the portrayal of such) is rather lacking in intensity. The plot then descends into a mindless cat and mouse chase, without much depth given to Abby characters. Although thrilling and entertaining, the plot is not very memorable or emotionally engaging. Though the scene of zombies breaking through a high wall is quite spectacular, it still is just a forgettable blockbuster.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Check. Production problems and reshoots? Check. A zombie movie with a PG-13 rating !? Check. With all these ""issues"" I was ready to swear off the movie completely, but curiosity got the better of me and I'm glad it did because World War Z is a movie that certainly shouldn't work, yet it does.As a fan of the book (I read it 4 years ago) I went into the film knowing that the script contained a cohesive story built around one character. Certain detractors of the film may dislike it solely for this reason because it is so different from the book. I would urge them to consider them as two separate entities. Once that is accepted, the film can be a pleasant surprise.Let's be honest, in the last 5 years film has become over saturated with zombies. So the makers of this film made some wise decisions intending to set their film apart. I'll admit I'm more of a traditionalist (slow moving zombies), but I like when film makers take risks at a new approach. The fast zombies in this film often use coordinated attacks,swarming like insects and that is something to ponder as well as visually behold. The film has a breakneck pace, with intense sequences...and it really has the feel of a global epidemic since it takes place in various locales around the world. I knew I wasn't the only one in the audience on the edge of my seat, as many times during this film I heard the rest of the audience let out a collective sigh of relief. By presenting zombies as a global problem in the first stages, it is a breathe of fresh air compared to the standard ""few survivors vs thousands of undead"" in a secluded fortress scenario. The film feels more like a political thriller than a zombie film, which belief me actually works to its benefit.Lastly, one gripe I have heard about the movie is a lack of character development. I agree, but I think character development would actually detract from the film. How many times in horror movies are supporting characters only there to serve the purpose of cannon fodder? Also, often times side characters are given moments to make a poignant speech before being killed off, which is a ploy by screenwriters to generate emotion from the audience. You'll see no such tricks here characters come and go, and we are often left to wonder about their fate. The film's frantic pace and lack of clichés really make it a surprising treat. 8/10","6 out of 8 found this helpful.

When I initially won, I was more excited about the thought of seeing Angelina Jolie (and her new breasts) in person than the actual movie, but it turned out that she was MIA that night. It was still cool to see Brad Pitt in person when he stopped by to introduce the movie after the film's director Marc Forster spoke for a few minutes. Pitt ensured us that they had a good movie in store for us, and he said that we should get the film going and not waste any more time.When I first heard about World War Z, I had no idea that the Z in the title refers to zombies, and even when I saw the trailer, there was no mention of zombies. If anything, the scene they showed from the beginning of the movie, when everyone was stopped in traffic and they heard explosions, made it look like it might be some kind of lame monster movie like Godzilla or even worse, Cloverfield.Brad Pitt stars as a former United Nations investigator who reluctantly abandons his family in order to face the task of figuring out what's causing the zombie pandemic all over the world and stop it before it destroys all of humanity. I've never read the book it's loosely based on, but people who have say the only thing the book and the movie share are the title. They wonder why Brad Pitt's production company Plan B Entertainment bothered to buy the rights to the book, which is a collection of individual accounts of the ongoing war against zombies.Despite his underrated talent and tendency to take on a wide range of roles, I was surprised that he did a film like this, being this is his first ""disaster/end-of-the-world"" movie. This seems more like something Will Smith would do, not Brad Pitt. In fact, the amount of violence and the creatures themselves were somewhat similar to the vampires featured in I Am Legend.The zombies featured in this movie are a combination of the virus-infected victims that are featured in 28 Days Later and the traditional Romero-esque zombies. The zombies in this movie would've been a hell of a lot scarier if they weren't CGI 90 percent of the time. Personally, I find the classic slow-moving zombies to be scarier than the fast-moving zombies. This film felt more like I was watching a Roland Emmerich film, like Independence Day, than a horror film. It seemed odd to me that a zombie film is rated PG-13, and I can imagine that hardcore zombie fanatics will be even more disappointed than I was.I'm not the biggest zombie buff around, but of the handful of zombie films that I've seen, the remake of Dawn of the Dead is one that really stands out for me. Shaun of the Dead was also great at spoofing zombie movies while simultaneously being a great zombie movie, similar to what Scream did for slashers. I can't really see World War Z going down as one of the greatest zombie flicks in history, nor as a great apocalyptic flick for that matter.Historically, I've never been too impressed with 3D, and this film was no exception. There were a few ""jump scenes"" that, although looked slightly cooler, I'm sure would've made me jump just the same. For much of the film, wearing the 3D glasses is just distracting in scenes where they're unnecessary, such as the first few minutes inside Gerry's house. At least the official World War Z 3D glasses that I decided to keep are a cool souvenir.Overall, the film definitely looks great, and some action sequences kicked so much ass that the audience erupted into applause. Although there are better zombie movies out there, you will certainly be excited and entertained, as long as you don't expect the same thought-provoking political commentary that you'd receive from an episode of ""The Walking Dead.""","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

But my sister's birthday came around and that's what she wanted to do so ""I had to."" And I am SO glad I gave it a chance!I'm an actual movie-going human being, not a critic. And I was RIVETED by this movie.I'd never heard of World War Z or that it was a book before it was a movie. Perhaps World War Z is like the X-Men series, in that it is far better if you have little to no knowledge of the ""canon"" material. I can't know.All I know is, to me, an outsider coming into the World War Z setting and concept completely fresh, I was swept up and blown away. In my honest and humble opinion, the acting was believable, the effects were never over-the-top or under par, the writing/directing was spot on-- I have no complaints at all.Also keep in mind that I am a 100% bona fide pansy who becomes easily terrified by movies that are not even supposed to be scary. My sister, on the other hand, is a scary movie junkie. I was clinging to her every time the music changed, and even she jumped a few times.TL;DR: This movie was exciting, engrossing, and held my attention 110% of the time. There was never a lull. And, if I'm honest, I was plugging my ears and squinting during a majority of the final third of the film. ;) If that doesn't speak for a thrilling movie doing it's job, I don't know what does.Do yourself a favor, and give this movie a chance.","18 out of 31 found this helpful.

Cons 1.Poor script, which could have been put together by a 12 yr old kid. 2.Characters are not at all developed, which makes you wonder, what the hell is the director trying to do? Brad Pitt is especially wasted in the movie. 3. No blood in a zombie movie?? I am not even sure who the target audience for this movie is.12-16 yr olds? Verdict: If you are fan of 3D movies, go for this one. Don't expect any award winning performances, but just enough action to keep you interested throughout the movie. The worst part of the movie is that the director makes you laugh inadvertently at scenes which are supposed to be dead serious.Perhaps they could invent a new genre for this movie....

Although there are no signs that Newark has changed, Pitt decides to rescue another third world orphan, who he renames ""Tommy"" and then gets choppered out to sea to study the outbreak.Pitt flies to South Korea next, where the zombies have caused constant darkness and torrential rain. Pitt talks to David Morse, who has pulled out all of his teeth but still talks fine, and then Brad decides to go to Israel to pacify Arab-Israeli relations.

Can't understand the obsession with the undead, but as zombie movies go, this one was at least entertaining. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt in an appreciated understated performance) is a former United Nations operative who battles the entire state of New Jersey to get his family to safety aboard the only refuge not infested with zombies, an aircraft carrier in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Once aboard, Gerry is briefed on the news that the entire world has been contaminated. Unfortunately, as the viewer, I would have liked just a little more discovery on what the possible cause of the zombie virus was. Gerry soon finds out that his being able to harbor his family in this safe compound comes with a price. The military wants him to escort a scientist to South Korea who may hold the key to a cure. When Gerry refuses, he is given the ultimatum, become unretired and lead the mission or his family finds another refuge. His family's safety his only concern, Gerry leads the team into South Korea which has also become zombie land. Pitt basically puts on a one man show from this point on, with an occasional assist from a human or two. This easily could have turned into a Swartzenegger hero against the world blockbuster, but Pitt takes the lower road, showing something that movie super heroes rarely show, fear; fear of the unknown, fear of failure and fear he will never see his family again. I didn't expect to like this film, but it was a pleasant surprise and I would recommend this for it's entertainment and intensity value. While there isn't a lot of actual bloodshed as one would expect from a movie about walking cannibals, the film might be too intense for younger viewers.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was like i followed the story but had no one who I wanted to survive the movie... and one thing a zombie movie must have (in my opinion) is one or more protagonists I share the excitement with. So the whole movie doesn't really cause some tension.Another problem was the self-confidence of the protagonist what is too uncalled for a zombie movie (what may correlate with my first problem) because there is no weakness in his character and so there is no need to be afraid for him.Nonetheless there were also some nice things, I really liked the zombies and there abilities. There were some really nice scenes (especially in Jerusalem) where they staged the zombies in an awesome way.Another positive aspect was that you felt the zombie cataclysm on the whole world and not like in other movies just in one town which creates some really oppressive atmosphere.All in all it's a zombie movie like you get dozens of out there. But it really has some nice footage and the zombies have a nice touch. So if you like zombies you can watch it but don't expect something special like I did.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's so fast paced you don't even have time to feel remotely bored. True, it's not an in-your-face gory / blood and guts zombie movie, but that's all been done already! It's quite refreshing to watch a zombie movie that isn't just all about ripped body parts. The story line may be simple, and perhaps rather predictable, however the movie doesn't fail to keep your eyes completely glued to the screen and you on the edge of your seat throughout. Don't take to much liquids - the movie is about 2 hours long and you don't want to be missing any of it.Just don't get all critical and start analyzing each frame or asking intelligent questions (yes there were quite a number of questions left unanswered). Definitely worth watching. Just enjoy it for what it is.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

The storyline follows a zombie outbreak due to a virus in the blood. A man who is in special ops is lucky to survive with his family; however, he has to work to stay safe, and his line of work makes him a perfect candidate to work for the United Nation to find the origin of the outbreak and possibly the cure. Can he survive such a mission?This movie is directed by Marc Forster (Finding Neverland) and stars Brad Pitt (Fight Club), Mireille Enos (Gangster Squad), Daniella Kertesz (Incitement), James Badge Dale (The Departed), David Morse (The Green Mile) and Ruth Negga (Agents of SHIELD).This movie has very clean and crisp cinematography and special effects. This is the definition of Hollywood horror with a solid cast, straightforward storyline and over the top action scenes that are unrealistic but fun to watch unfold. The airplane crash was a bit rediculous, but the zombie wall and helicopter scenes are legendary. I will say the camouflage idea was over the top and caused me to roll my eyes, but okay. The makeup and depiction of the zombies was first rate and more films should leverage zombie sounds and biting noises, which were excellent in this. I will say I didn't love Pitt as the main character in this.Overall, this is a fun watch and not as bad as some make it out to be. I would score this a 7/10 and strongly recommend it.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

WWZ just didn't show a lot of blood but somehow it worked. At parts it can get really scary. World War Z had a lot of action and it kept you on the edge of your seat until the very end.

But as they're driving through the city, something is wrong. People start running, cars start crashing and Pitt distinguished some people attacking others who then start contorting violently only to end up attacking others.Pitt I guess is still so revered at the UN that they send a helicopter the next day to rescue him and his family. But first he has to survive the night. They are taken to some aircraft carrier where the military is running things, while the President has been attacked. The UN wants something from him. It's still not clear what he did at the UN but he's the only one who can take on this mission. The mission is to guide a scientist to discover the origin of the zombie disease. He and the scientist and a special ops team fly to Korea because that's where the first mention of ""zombie"" came from.In Korea, the scientist suffers a surprising and neat fate, not before giving an interesting speech on how mother nature works. They learn from a US base military team that a prisoner was ill and attacked his doctor and then military guys. Pitt finds out that the israelis apparently had advanced notice of the outbreak because they finished building a wall surrounding their country just in time and thus are not affected.So off Pitt goes to Israel where he meets an agent who gives him a fascinating insight into Israeli strategic thinking and tells him that they heard for the first time of the undead from a communication coming from India. But by then some sporadic dancing and singing attracts the zombies who climb over the giant wall and attack almost everyone. While Pitt tries to make it to the airport to travel to India, he adopts some little soldier girl who got bitten and he realizes that his pilot flew away so to they stop a plane on the runway and climb in.A zombie hiding in the restroom is freed and soon enough we have zombies on a plane, so Pitt does the next logical thing- explode a grenade midflight. The plane crashes conveniently close to Pitts new destination near a WHO research facility. Of course only Pitt, the girl and a zombie survive. At the facility Pitt experiments with the solution he has come up with.Not sure what the title World War Z refers to as there is no war. While we don't get a story of the origin of the disease,we get a very interesting solution to the problem. The movie starts out pretty good, but soon enough goes on mute as no one has anything interesting anymore to say. The zombies are the usual--for these days-- quick running zombies. In fact they act like little Hulks ambushing people sideways and toppling them like bowling pins. The effects are fairly cartoonish, too. There is a single scare, but it's a good one that had the entire theater crowd jumping. The movie is 30 minutes too long wasting too much time on Pitt's family- something no one cares about. The ideas here are smart, but the script at times is very dumb.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It does involve a lot of zombies but I would class this as more of a disaster movie. The zombie were mainly seen in hordes going up buildings and over walls, rather than up close and personal. There wasn't much blood either.The film was shot incredibly well and looked very realistic, the scene on the plane was probably the most impressive and the scene I enjoyed the most. The atmosphere is dark and the tension builds up nicely. The action scenes are very fast paced when we get them as well. Some of the scenes are actually breathtaking and just crazy.The acting is solid all round and we do feel for Brad Pitt's character because we found out a bit about him at the start of the film, and we know he is doing it for his family first and foremost.The way it ended was a bit unsatisfying and I feel the plot was a bit rushed in places. It is a solid action flick but some parts may drag a little.I would recommend it though, it was enjoyable, well filmed, acted well, had tension and atmosphere, good action. But there was just that little something missing, I can't quite grasp what but it definitely had potential to be more than it was.7/10.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The globetrotting adventures are as smart as they are stupid and even with neutered PG-13 zombies it can still deliver plenty of epic and suitably tense set pieces.In a film as nail-biting as this, having Brad Pitt as the lead works so well because he can really anchor everything. His character is competent, resourceful, relatable and always trying to save as many people as he can which makes him the best character to experience this film through. There's a steady stream of recognisable faces in small but well developed roles too.Marc Forster seems cursed to direct large scale blockbusters that go through production hell but his direction of high octane, hyperactive action sequences has gotten a lot stronger since his last outing (Quantum of Solace). Marco Beltrami's score can be sinister and sombre with ease but what makes it stand out are the moments where it's full of hope.The chaotic production is well known and obvious from the three massively different credited screenwriters and yet the film comes out the other end with minimal damage done. Swapping from gigantic hordes of CG zombies in open areas to practical ones in a confined space makes it clear where the pivot is; however, it allows the film to go from delivering one kind of spectacle to a different but equally effective type.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

It engages from minute one and keeps you tightly bound until the end. The premise is simple; zombies have spread wildly and are taking over the planet. Nowhere seems safe, and unlike ""traditional"" zombies, these are fast and the turn around from bite to zombie is twelve seconds so infestation of an area is exponentially fast.Brad Pitt is believable as the ex-UN worker, who gets called up to help out, he's convincing as a man who's seen action in the field and picked up a thing or two, and is fit and able to run around and take care of himself and his family. He played the action guy but also the guy who is worried about his family, and those he's in a team with sensibly. The ""solution"" isn't stupidly come across, by a leap or intuition, or without realistic casualties. It doesn't keep close to the book at all, but has taken the spirit of the story and made a huge film out of it. It was a massive scale film, with epic CGI vistas of zombies taking down whole cities - and the SFX of the film, the zombies themselves are brilliant. Everyone in the film acted it very real, and you hope against hope that there is a solution but you have no clue what it could possibly be.There are flaws in the logic of the film, and much is left unexplained, which is annoying, but it doesn't really detract from the film experience, which is a spectacle to be sure. I don't get the 'fast zombie' thing but in this genre-version it seemed to work. The end of the film left an opening for future films without being too obviously cliff-hangerish and I was pleased how international it was and wasn't too flag-waving American. Overall a great film, very entertaining.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

When the trailer initially came out some time ago, we all felt that it looked a bit rushed and cheesy... that it would likely be long on action (and probably exclusively of the CG type), and short on practical effects, story and character development. Well, while there are some impressive displays of CG throughout the film, the movie does, thankfully, retain its ability to keep the viewer emotionally invested in the goings-on and the characters circumstances. This can be a very tough ratio to balance, given that the movie studios tend to push too much for action much of the time in an effort to generate ticket sales, neglecting the story.World War Z is impressive in that it incorporates action and the CG elements into a larger whole. Meaning they are used to serve the story, instead of being its substitution.This is the type of movie you'll go into and as soon as it starts, it's over. Almost two hours have gone by, and they just fly. The pacing is perfect, as out protagonist treks the globe, racing to find a reason to hope. The effects and cinematography are superb, which adds to the overall thrill. An amazing adventure, be sure to catch this one. You'll be glad you did.10/10 (especially to offset the other vapid reviews already posted here)","32 out of 64 found this helpful.

I was more interested in seeing if the movie-makers had found anything new to do with the undead; surely by now even the most ardent of zombie fans are sick of the slow, shambling corpses who lose pounds by the moment as whole chunks of them fall rotting to the ground.The only real, significant innovation in the Zombie genre of late came, of course, from the UK, in the shape of ""28 days later"", with its depiction of the undead as vicious, hyperactive lunatics. World War Z's zombies have been wisely depicted in this manner, but this doesn't give the movie any points for originality.However, the concept of how these creatures are seen to run amok is arrestingly unprecedented: In this movie, the endless hoards of the dead are so numerous and so wired that they form mountains as they scramble over each other, and then said mountains suddenly seem to become tidal waves that crash down onto towns. I found these scenes to be quite mind-blowing - especially those set in Jersualem, whose security measures prove to be disastrously inadequate.Finally, I'd urge you not to pay much attention to those who are panning the performances, dialogue and plot as being feeble and lazy. They aren't.

I am always skeptical of ""M"" rated horror films (PG-13 in the U.S.), they are usually to tame to be scary but this film was genuinely scary and suspenseful. I have been watching horror movies since I was 3 years old (over 50 years ago) so very little scares or surprises me ... this film did! I felt compelled to write this review because I saw there were many negative reviews on IMDb and I simply don't understand why? I suppose most Zombie buffs would be looking for more gore but do not be put off by that, I nearly made the mistake of not going after reading some of those reviews, however the lack of real gore is not an issue! This is an intelligent Zombie/Virus movie and certainly about as realistic as you could get and I've seen probably every Zombie movie ever made. By realistic I mean that if we did actually have a Zombie apocalypse, I believe it would be very close to what is portrayed in this film, it is believable in that way. It cost me $50.00 to see it last night and I went away thinking it was money well spent, that doesn't always happen at the movies!","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

The scenes,the places, the characters kept on changing, except the main lead of course. It's not a very scary movie (said from a person that is easily scared), but there are some scenes in which the biggest cities in the world are shown, filled with zombies at every corner and it makes you wonder how you will react in a similar situation; when there is nothing but panic and chaos. It's not some memorable movie, but it's very entertaining and definitely worth seeing (at the cinema also).","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Sure, it follows your usual dramaturgy so very well known from about a quarter million other movies from Hollywood but against the background of the genre, WWZ really manages to shine in some parts.The Novella by Max Brooks, which this movie is based upon, is definitely recognisable even if the writers of the screenplay took their freedoms. The parts where the film borrows from the book are also and unsurprisingly the strongest. The whole setting is a refreshing approach to the genre as the initial outbreak and how people and governments probably would try to fight it is portrayed and not the dystopian aftermath, which is the case with pretty much every other title of the genre. I also like how the fast spread of such a virus/disease in densely populated areas and the consequences with gigantic hordes of zombies are displayed. All these are authentic aspects (as far as a ""zombie apocalypse"" goes however) you rarely see in other titles of the genre except the beginning of the original ""Dawn of the Dead"" from 1978.If the characters wouldn't have followed your usual stereotypes and the film would have dealt with the socio-economic implications of such an event more (a bit like ""Contagion"" from 2011 - e.g. what about oil, food, power etc. if everything comes to a standstill) it could have even been a truly great addition to the genre. This way, it is just a tad bit above average.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It brings the concept of zombie movies up to a serious point, the way Dark Knight elevated comic book movies into a serious realm. I want to start of responding to some points made by others. To start with, trying to compare this with other zombie movies borders on a bad idea. This may indeed be yet another zombie movie, but it takes the idea of zombie apocalypse to a whole new level. And also offers something all the more precarious that none of the others have really ever put forward, hope. I have noticed people trying to compare it to 28 Days Later. This is an immense mistake for one major reason. 28 Days Later is not a zombie movie. It seems like one but in reality none of the infected are dead. Not zombies. As far as Brad Pitt being in this, to be quite honest I was skeptical. I couldn't picture Brad Pitt fighting zombies and taking him seriously. He surprised me. He did an amazing job in this movie. Far better than people have given him credit for. Despite what many others have said, the zombies are actually quite realistic. Though when moving in mass (you will see in Jerusalem) you can tell there is CG involved it doesn't take away from it. Especially when seeing them up close. The make-up easily rivals Walking Dead. As far as the athleticism of the zombies, that can be easily explained. They are not limited by pain. Nearly every human body is capable of great speed, strength, agility, and dexterity. What stops us from doing all of those things, is pain, and our own sense of exhaustion. Take away the ability to feel pain, to get tired, to need air and food, and you have an unstoppable machine. Give it a single minded determination and you have a World War Z zombie. In an interview someone said that the zombies in this movie are treated as if they were, ""a force of nature."" They succeeded. The misfortunes you see that occur through out the movie, are so realistic and possible you can almost feel the doom to yourself proceeding each event. This not only leads showing great acts of selflessness and courage but also deplorable acts of cowardice and stupidity. I loved that this didn't rely on super amounts of gore. Modern horror movies no longer rely on suspense, surprise, and that adrenaline rush that leaves you nearly hyperventilating for the hero. Nope, just blood, and guts, and the biggest shock value possible. This movie doesn't leave you feeling like your popcorn is going to make a repeat performance. It gives you an adrenaline rush. One thing people also always talk about is the fact that zombie apocalypse couldn't happen. But the reality is that it could. All it takes is a virus, a single virus, and everything is possible. That sounds crazy, but new virus' are found all the time, develop and evolve all the time. Someone points out that zombies are such an improbable possibility, that unless some is saying, ""what if it it possible?"" then there is no hope for survival. Though I do not get where anybody would get the ludicrous concept that this movie is even remotely sexist, I guess everybody has to find a PC controversy to make themselves feel better. The need for Brad Pitt's character to emotionally develop throughout this movie is almost cliché. His character didn't need to emotionally develop, he needed to intellectually develop, which he did. To say that everything was felt and only impacted skin deep, completely misses the fact that zombie apocalypse isn't the place for emotional growth, and wasn't paying attention to how things played out between Gerry and many of the other characters. Now after this bit by bit response to other complaints, let me say this. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat (and many others in the theater as well, the only reason I noticed was because the guy behind my husband came close to falling off his seat and into my husbands lap.) I never hide my face during horror movies, but I did through this. It scared the heck out of me, and yet it left me contemplating. This is, without a doubt, the best zombie movie I have ever seen.","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

No cure, no medicine to reduce, people who turns to a Zombie can only be killed by destroy the head (It seems Zombies respect the theory that only brain death is really died). In this new Zombie movie, the turning process is still so quick which only needs 10 seconds, even faster than this in Resident Evil. Now here not exactly same as Alice, Gerry is a normal person but with Seal training, retiring at home enjoying his family happiness. He was reluctantly convinced to take part in the action looking for the cure of the virus. He is kind of stupid, so does his wife, they tried to not go, but any guy who can brainstorm will see why they are rescued and allowed to stay in the ship. So I have to say the director waste nearly 3 minutes to explain a plot which supposed to be an obvious thing. However, from the three minutes if we consider it from the direction of Peter, maybe it makes sense. Maybe it is what the real Peter wants to say. He wants to company with his family but he could hardly let his career go. Finally he has to get back again.It is possible that this movie will have several continuations, because of Darwin's Evolution Theory. But if so, it probably will be as same as Resident Evil. So my suggestion, making some differences or let it go.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

As I have seen my fair share of zombie movies, WWZ puts a new twist on the 'Zombie Virus'.I couldn't help but notice key similarities between WWZ and the latest zombie console game, The Last of Us. Normally we expect nothing but long drawn out chase scenes involving a plethora of bullets, but WWZ and TLOU actually contain some strategy. Obviously if you are in an abandoned building and you make a lot of noise, zombies will come. However, the way WWZ executed these scenes, was much more favorable to me then all the typical crap out there.Instead of 30 zombies running down the hall quickly just because a door shut, they become more agitated as they hear more sound. Not just one thump.I did not read the book so I cannot make comparisons to the original content, but this was definitely entertaining and intense.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Most zombie movies I've seen have disappointed me, and ""World War Z"" is other notch on that list.I haven't read the book the movie is based on, but I suspect it must have been a lot better than this. What went wrong? I'm not sure. Despite all the money that was thrown at this movie (including refilming the ending), the movie at times doesn't seem that expensive. Another problem is that the zombies themselves aren't explored closely. You never really get a sense of what they are like and what they can do. Why would they only bite people instead of eating them, like zombies in other movies? Well, that's probably because the movie stubbornly sticks to being at a PG-13 level. Yes, that's right - a zombie movie without that much blood and gore, which I know will annoy many horror fans.Well, I guess the movie isn't THAT bad, but it's a big disappointment.

The first act, usually the first half hour is generally where the conflict is introduced. This film opens with Gerry Lee, Brad Pitt, a former UN investigator having breakfast with his family. Five minutes later, BAM, zombies. No time is wasted getting straight to the conflict. Begin second act.The story is not complicated: zombies take over the world and Brad Pitt is obliged to save the day. The assault of zombie movies over the past few years has been such an onslaught that by default the genre itself now gives me an automatic feeling of ""I don't care."" World War Z is very much another zombie film, but a damn exciting one. Even the script's name for becoming a zombie, turning Zeke, is subtlety refreshingly""It's not what you say but how you say it."" With cinematic excellence, Director Marc Forster breaths new live into this tired cliché. It's all in the delivery, and WWZ is all delivery.As Gerry Lee (Pitt) travels the world trying to solve the mystery behind the infection causing people to turn ""Zeke,"" the scenes that unfold during his expedition are so exciting that story arc is incidental in comparison. A memorable scene is when a military commander becomes infected. He's got about ten seconds: ""I'm a goddamn ZekeI got this one boys."" He puts a bullet in this own headThe exotic set designs of the adventurous locales are the highlights of the film. First an adrenaline pumped escape from an infested Philadelphian housing project, then to a US navy ship at sea, then over to a US military base in Korea where a massive fire fight breaks out. Next Lee arrives in Israel where the citizens have protected themselves against the Zekes in a totally ingenious, but vulnerable walled up construction. The set design here is just incredible and when the situation goes awry, and things start blowing up, the visual effects are some of the best around, bar none.For more film reviews visit getthebonesaw.blogspot.com","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Bit shaky but all together a satisfactory movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3338128/?ref_=tt_urv","willcundallreview","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur47850240/?ref_=tt_urv","19 October 2015","Brad Pitt fights zombies and tries to find a cure to the widespread pandemic of the un-dead that are tearing the world apart. The movie is very fast and lots of things happen, Pitt seems to go every place there is on earth and just brings trouble wherever he steps foot, and he doesn't even kick that much ass. Now OK the movie is well OK and it goes along well, bit of a shaky start but it gets into an fairly nice flow, sometimes I didn't feel much of a connection with the characters but all in all they are fun kind of and the actors playing them do an alright job. The film suffers from an abundance of special effects and they seem weirdly outdated seeing as this is a high budget high octane thriller, you expect it to look good with the CGI.The movie is set in a whole lot of places, it feels like your typical disaster movie but of course add in the zombies and you have ""The Day After Tomorrow"" but instead of snow falling, it's zombies. It's as mentioned before very fast, the cameras go a little crazy with the shaky cam and some scenes with a lot going on get lost in all the movement, it feels like some kind of relief when the camera finally sits still. The movie mixes action but also a kind of emotion to not make this OTT but also not overly emotional either, it feels like action but with brains behind it.Brad Pitt produces and stars in this movie and is very acceptable in the role, sometimes the pace doesn't really work and I'm not going to sit here and say Pitt was great, but he is satisfactory in the lead role as Gerry Lane a former United Nations employee. The cast is not really an all star cast other than Pitt which is nice because you don't feel that blockbuster kind of feeling when the characters are simply talking to one another. The films pace yet again makes some actors roles very insignificant, it can feel that the people behind it don't want you to feel anything for anyone other than Pitt and some people he meets along the way. I liked Marc Forster as director but I can't say he knocked this out the park, his handle on the movie can overuse some things like effects and of course the cinematography, well I don't know if it was him or Ben Serisin who was the cinematographer for this. As the writing goes it can be good and bad in equal measures, it is exciting work in the writing for sure but it never truly lets the plot mature and I wasn't so keen on the ending, even Forster can't make the end any better. The locations are truly great and hats off to the people who found the places or built the studio sets because it at least feels real, it never looks like its fake or anything and it makes you feel like this is more real than many other zombie movies out there.I can't say I really liked the movie but I certainly didn't dislike it, for me it was alright and from what I have seen of others they mostly like it but many do not, not quite a love it or hate it kind of film but still one where moments can annoy people. A thing to add is don't watch this if you have read the book this is adapted from and expect it to be the same, try as hard as you can to watch it as a movie piece rather than comparing the two because this is completely different storytelling and to judge it on how it compares or according to some ""pales"" in comparison, it would be harsh on this.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

World War Z gets right to the action from the very beginning, and it creates the most hectic environments you can possibly think of. Brutality-wise, it's obviously not as gory as zombie flicks such as Dawn of the Dead but it fully pushes it's PG-13 rating to the extent. Throughout the movie, it blends it's genre of horror and action masterfully and even though there are a few laughs, it's overall tone is pretty serious yet still entertaining. The ""father"" role seems to fit Brad Pitt nicely and the trailer may have represented this film as if it was brainless but as far as zombie movies go, it uses it's brain. You will be jumping out of your seat not because of fright but because of how tense the scenes are. The score goes along with the numerous moods in the film. It's completely original, to every single detail, even the zombies(appearance and behavior are different from the average zombie). Overall, this isn't a movie but better, it's a journey that will contain surprises and above all fun.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

Keeping in view my history with the ""Zombies (in the fiction off course)"", I thought of this movie as a typical horror with some Brad Pitt ""Extra"".But When I actually saw the movie, I came to know, I was quite wrong in my perception. As opposed to many other movies on the Zombies subject, this particular movie is a actually a good combination of horror, thriller, disaster & some good humor lines. One thing that I particularity noticed was the bloodless action making it perfect for family and audience of all ages.Brad Pitts performance was excellent as usual and I think his presence in the movie would have attracted a lot of Pitt's fan base (even those who do not like the Zombie genre). Other actors performed well too.All in all it was a good movie and I give it 7/10.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Daniella Kertesz seemed to play the most interesting character, the Israeli soldier who travels with Pitt's character. All of the big-budget stuff is here, the cinematography, the effects, the re-written ending after being shown to test audiences. I am fairly glad that I didn't waste theater-type money to see it.

No filler, just action. Much like movies such as Cloverfield and 28 Weeks Later/28 Days Later you'll feel like you're in the movie experiencing it as one of the characters. It moves so well it feels like it flies by but in a good way. I recommend it. The acting is good too. Cinematography is epic and special effects are above average.

That being said, if you've read the book beforehand, the trailers alone should let you know that the film is going in wholly different direction that Max Brooks laid out in his novel.I am a huge fan of the zombie franchise, which George Romero essentially put a patent on and dozens of films have branched off from over the years. What ""World War Z"" does is attempt to mesh the behavioral patterns of the ""28 Days Later"" infected undead (I refuse to call them zombies, zombies are the slow, shuffling Romero staple) with the essential ideas behind Brooks' book. It does this admirably, but it's a direction that ultimately didn't need to be taken in order to make the film successful. In my mind, it felt like a lazy way of telling a story that builds itself up, cutting time off of the reel in favor of a more fast-paced, energized film experience.Being a huge fan of the book, I refused to shell out the $10 to see it in the theaters; as I said, the trailers told me clearly that the film was going to diverge far enough from the book for me to lower my expectations. As a rental, and for what it is, it's nowhere near terrible. Remove all comparisons to the book it takes minor inspirations from, and Brad Pitt does a solid job of weaving his way through a decently scripted and constructed horror film.This ended up being Pitt's highest grossing film to date, and a combination of factors play into that, not least of which being a rather stale list of opposing options in theaters at the time of its release. Still, it's an enjoyable film, however far it deviates from the source material, and however ridiculous some of us may think calling something that runs a zombie. Could have been better...and could have been a whole lot worse.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

But all the way through I was struggling to really care, either about the rather predictable premise that human stupidity created the zombies through some form of virus or sickness even though the zombies seemed to suddenly have impossible strength and speed which would require significant bone, muscle and organ replacement surely...or indeed about the people trying to survive. Perfect film to watch if you are going to sort of pay attention, but might make a cuppa now and again or check the sports scores on your tablet and don't mind missing 30 seconds here and there.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The zombies are fast where in pop culture most tend to be slow , thus raising the danger and the overall fear that these creatures bring to the table . This movie shows the government/scientific side of a zombie apocalypse where most zombie themed movies follow a small group of survivors and it's always heavily implied the government is gone and no longer exists , but this movie provides the opposite , the government isn't only actively fighting to find a solution but they actually do end up finding one. The idea that this virus only seeks out a healthy host is brilliant , these creatures refuse to target the terminally ill which brings such an original concept to the table . Most zombie movies are fun but imaginative where this one feels like it could be a reality one day given the right circumstances. Overall I will always highly rate this movie above most zombie themed shows and movies for its refreshing originality . It's satisfying to see such a unique concept come to life in a seemingly overdone genre .","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

It has just enough scientific basis to make it plausible but at the same time the cinematography is absolutely brilliant. In terms of scale, it is also unusual in that this movie spans the entire globe, thus giving a relatively macro-view of what a global zombie pandemic looks like. Overall a must see!Positives: the fall of Jerusalem is arguably one of the best scenes I've in a movie theater in a long time. The initial buildup, the calm before the storm, the first victim, the gathering of momentum as the zombies begin to gain the upper hand, absolutely brilliant! Fast action without a lot of the cheap suspense of people walking around in abandoned places and being jumped by lone zombies. Lack of character development has been cited as a negative for this film but I'd have to say that most of the characters were surprisingly well-developed WITHOUT falling into the standard zombie apocalypse tropes. More importantly, it's a freaking zombie movie, exactly how much character development do you want anyways? It's a good mix between action and humanism, without neglecting either aspect.Negatives: ending was a little abrupt, some questions remain unanswered, less emphasis on politics, minor details.","14 out of 26 found this helpful.

Brad Pitt plays in the starring role where he has to leave his family and look for a cure for the virus. So the plot is pretty basic but smart at the same time with some great dialog and good direction. Yes, this is a zombie movie that is rated PG-13 which makes it obvious that this movie is not really going to be gory like earlier zombie flicks like Dawn of the Dead (2004) or Zombieland. It has a lot of zombie action but never gets to be gory where they make it involve no casualties or they cut the camera before there's any explicit gore. It kind of comes more to a disaster film where it really shows the global effect of the zombie apocalypseBut just because this film isn't gory, and stomach turning, doesn't mean it's not entertaining. There are many great thrills through the movie, but it does get a bit uneven which can throw audiences off. It isn't very powerful, but its a smart thriller of how they find the cure by using a familiar and kind of weak narrative.

These cannibals are quick! And ready to rip into you faster than you can say World War Z. They can climb skyscrapers, take down helicopters, and even break into secure hospitals if there's an ounce of blood nearby. As expected they spend the first thirty minutes of the movie destroying the most significant cities (i.e. New York, Washington D.C. – any place that has a well-known landmark) and its Brad Pitt's job to bring the epidemic to an end.What Works – His long beard and even longer mane makes Pitt completely believable as a United Nations investigator. He's not a typical action hero. His mission isn't to save the world- just preserve what's left of humanity.What Doesn't Work – The wife and kids. Every man needs something to fight for but these people aren't it. Mireille Enosase doesn't have the sexiness and strength necessary to play Pitt's wife. And Sterling Jerins and Abigail Hargrove are two complaining kids that would barely survive middle school let alone the apocalypse. Angelina Jolie and their third-world adopted kids would have endured the zombie epidemic with no problems.What I Thought – Worth the Admission World War Z is worth the admission. Its action/drama/horror sequence is all the genres mixed into one and makes this summer movie so intense. Is it typical? Yes. A virus breaks out unexpectedly. Lots of people run and scream, some die, others are turned. There are aerial-shots of all the usual tourist attractions and in the end it's the race to find a cure. But still it's a fun and scary journey worth taking a tour to see – at the very least worldwide zombies are more fascinating than the domestic ones you've seen before.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

Clever title, right? But seriously, this film is thrill-deficient. Sure it's got a global scope, but it has a tiny scale. That may be par for the course in your typical zombie movie, but this one happens to have the word ""War"" in it. Yeah it has a few large-scale set pieces, but it really doesn't add up to anything more than hordes of computer generated zombies descending like locusts on groups of hapless victims.Attempts to add character depth by saddling our hero (Brad Pitt, in a solid turn) with a family that we know is never in any real danger because Hollywood would never kill off kids in a PG-13 film, fall flat and only serves to slow down the film's already lethargic pace.World War Z isn't a bad movie, but its attempt to blend popcorn movie aesthetics with zombie movie sensibilities doesn't quite succeed.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A good zombie film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2829623/?ref_=tt_urv","Thomas-Giffin","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur32380950/?ref_=tt_urv","11 July 2013","I really liked this film.It was the perfect mix of intimate intensity, emotion and absolute, terrifying spectacle.Directed by Marc Forster (Quantum of Solace, Monster's Ball), and starring Brad Pitt, the film deals with a zombie outbreak on a global scale and the attempts to find the source and cure.Certainly, the film is barely ten minutes young when it all kicks off. We're quickly introduced to Gerry Lane (Pitt), his wife (Mireille Enos) and their children and then the outbreak begins. Certainly the difference between this film and almost any other zombie film preceding it is scale. It is a LARGE scale film, the CGI is used incredibly effectively for portraying thousands of zombies at a time.It is this that creates the intensity. The sheer numbers and volume of the zombies overwhelm and the film certainly has fun with the large scale scenes and the behaviour of these creatures. There are a few times where the sheer scale of the events on the screen is awesome in the very literal sense of the word, you are in awe. This scale is impressive on a technical level but it's even more impressive that Marc Forster, Brad Pitt and scriptwriters (initially J. Michael Straczynski, then later Matthew Michael Carnahan, Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof for re-writes) manage to find the human story and relationships amid all the mayhem. Certainly the supporting cast provide compelling roles, special mention must be made to Daniella Kertesz as an Israeli soldier.The humanity of the story helps to fuel the tension for the other kind of 'zombie' scenes, which are the quieter, scarier type of scenes which don't feature as many zombies. Is it here that the pacing (and scale) are dimmed down hugely. The film doesn't stop to a halt, but the tone of the third half of the film is certainly slower than the rest of the film. Apparently, it was here that the rewrites and re-shooting had their main impact on the film. It's a noticeable shift in the overall tone of the film which actually is quite welcome for one main reason.There is no way they could have gone bigger than scenes earlier in the film. They don't try to outdo the earlier scenes in scale or number of zombies present, instead, it shifts the tension much more to the characters and I found it works. I could imagine that people could have disappointed with the lack of 'bang' at the end of the film but for me, it worked. The film has a few really nice touches in there as well, nice actions the characters take that seem very honest and real as well as you hear about some countries reactions to the outbreak which make sense.Now, it is most certainly true to say that the film differs from the book. That is a fact. The book deals with World War Z as a series of interviews from people important to the event itself, separate narratives and so on. The film has a single narrative path, beginning, middle, end, and only really following Gerry Lane throughout the events. However, I found the film to be a superior zombie film as well as a stunning (and intense) action picture.The point was also made afterwards that whilst it has scary moments and is very intense, it is light on actual gore. Certainly the usual zombie cliché of some guy graphically getting eaten alive is not present. The film certainly isn't a 15 for explicit violence but the general tone of the film is not only intense, but pretty bleak too(I don't often mention the film's rating in my reviews btw).Anyway, really enjoyed the film. Would easily watch again.","23 out of 47 found this helpful.

Removing the subtleties and tension that make films scary only creates a mindless action fest. World War Z follows Brad Pitts character as he travels around the world investigating the cause of a 'rabies' style outbreak which is turning people in fast, agile crazy people. The zombies themselves are more like rabid dogs, so calling them 'the undead' doesn't seem appropriate. The film relies on large CGI set pieces rather than tense and claustrophobic horror (although to its credit, the film does include some of this classic horror later on) In terms of characters, the film leaves them undeveloped and one- dimensional. There is potential, but the film would rather jump from place to place, feeding you the same formula each time without really giving you any deeper meaning or discussion.World War Z suffers from what many generic action films do - a huge VFX budget and a bland un-engaging script, designed to wow audiences with a flashy look but leaving very little food for thought or substance.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The writers and directors want people to think it is a zombie movie, but there is not gore and decapitation like all good zombie movies should have hence it doesn't get past the M rating. There are some funny moments in the movie in which I do not think the director intended. This Movie has the features of a fantastic action movie. Yes the director puts hardly any effort into the emotional side of things but you don't seem to mind for there is just action and more action. there are only a few moment in the film where you can actually relax.

'The Walking Dead' kind of took over the whole zombie franchise with their mind-blowing series. Anyway, 'World War Z', just like 'Man of Steel', was brought up to be huge. When it went into the box office it immediately made millions of dollars because of all the fans that have been waiting for it to come out for several months. So, anyway, the pressure is on. Here's what I thought about 'World War Z'.It started out moving very fast and flying through scenes, which disappointed me a little. I enjoyed that there was action, and that it didn't take forever, but it just went by too fast. Well, a few scenes after that I realized that they had a reason to go fast: They needed time to build up to the action. The reason I realized that is because it started to go really slow and bored, so 'World War Z' didn't start out that well in my opinion. It needed to redeem itself in the rest of the movie, which it actually did.So, at this point, I had no idea what to expect. I was wandering what was going to happen and how it was going to end. Soon after this, though, what I thought was the coolest part of the movie came up. It was scene where in the previews there were 100s of zombies climbing up on each other up to a wall. That part was in a huge context, well explained, and had a very entertaining and exciting action sequence. I truly loved that part. Also, shortly after that, there was another very cool scene, but then the slowness came back, which is what this movie is: Action, then slowness, action, then slowness. I thought that was okay, but I didn't expect the movie to be like that.There was something in this movie that was interesting. This was the use of the word 'zombie'. Most other zombie movies or television series' don't say zombie. They say 'walker', 'infected', 'diseased'... etc. In this movie the use of the word 'zombie' comes up every now and then. I thought it was kind of cool because no other movie that I've seen about zombies have said it, other than 'Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies', which was terrible. No other monster movies have restricted saying the word of what we call them. Vampires, werewolves, giants, robots, etc. I also thought that in these zombie movies of television series', they wouldn't live in a world without zombie comic books and shows and movies.Near the end of this movie it was getting really slow, and I thought, ""Come on now, pick it up."" The movie was starting to lose its good points from me... Well, when it got to the end, there were very interesting and entertaining things. It wasn't really action, so you'll see when you see the movie. That part kept me on the edge of my seat, though. There was a lot of suspense in that part. It eventually turned into an action scene, which was cool. Anyway, after that, there was a bit of a twist, which I really liked. Then, the movie started wrapping up, and when the movie stops, it kind of just stops. I was thinking, ""Whoa, I guess it's just... Over."" My 8/10 rating means that I thought 'World War Z' was really good. I very much recommend this movie.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Brimming with palpable tension, replete with suspenseful moments, and pulsating with heart- pounding action. Fans of zombie movies or horror film in general will love this latest Hollywood rendition of sprinting, wall-climbing zombies. Traditionalists don't need to be put off by the this new, revamped version of zombie mobility and should instead, graciously welcome this innovative conceptualization of zombie action.The back-story is appropriately integrated into the proceedings and the each course of action is well justified from both, the director's as well as the viewers' perspectives. But make no mistake, the movie offers no spoon-fed helpings and you need to pay proper attention - even though you won't need to rack your brains - to attune yourself with the flow of this apocalyptic environment.One of the most delightful aspects of ""World War Z"" is that it boasts of an abundance of memorable, nerve-wracking scenes - the hallmark of most great films - that will remain with you for days after leaving the cinema hall. Some of the scenes literally have to be seen to be believed (especially the entire scenario in Israel and the film's climax in the WHO building), and you'll be begging yourself to catch a second serving of this delectable film at the earliest. Fans of the novel won't be disappointed, as the author's vision (though certain aspects have been tweaked for creative and cinematic purposes) is maintained in essence and pertinent and crucial parts of the novel have been retained.Most impressive is director Marc Forster's (Finding Neverland, The Kite Runner) assured craftsmanship. With just a few credible projects on his resume and no proof of expertise in the horror or action genre (please don't even mention the appalling ""Quantum of Solace""), one could easily be forgiven to dismiss his merit as a director for a movie of this magnitude. But after watching the film, one would again be easily forgiven to plead with the studio not to change the director for the movie's sequel, and make no mistake, this is a sequel that will be eagerly anticipated when it's announced.Finally, Brad Pitt once again proves why he's regarded as a global cinema icon. He succinctly balances the complex task between being a moviestar you'll root for and an actor who you'll empathize and care for. Among a cast (excluding the zombies of course) that has virtually nothing to do - besides the intensely riveting Daniella Kertesz - he ably shoulders the film from the first scene to the last and prevents it from being relegated to just another mindless and fun zombie flick. ""World War Z"" is yet another jewel in his already studded crown and shall go down as a genuine horror classic in years to come.","22 out of 45 found this helpful.

The recipe is known and doesn't stray much from what we've seen so many times before - but it's always enjoyable: zombie outbreak, hero leads a team in search of answers regarding its origin. The film plays it safe and focuses on having good action and a lot of suspense rather than try to have a deeper message or get smart, and it's probably for the best. Meanwhile, it avoids the clichés it needs to stay away from: fluke solutions, (too) bad science (like the ""oh, we have a drop of blood from patient zero, the vaccine will be ready in 5 minutes"" phenomenon), etc are fortunately absent. Brad Pitt has no difficulty pulling off a not too dramatically demanding role and the ending is open enough to satisfy everyone, after a somewhat anticlimactic last confrontation scene. Somewhere in between a few original ideas for the genre are carefully placed.Finally, the film did leave me wondering about one thing. Even though there are some very impressive scenes (especially the ones in Jerusalem) where it makes the difference, is there a reason for a zombie film with such a huge budget, when wonders have been made with -small- fractions of this one's cost? But I suppose this is a question for the producers.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

And it isn't. It's a whole new zombie story in itself with the only similarity with the book being the title. The movie is decent, but it's nothing special. In the first half of the movie, they throw everything they've got at you and the last half felt like they got bored when writing the story line. It felt like it was only a 45 min. movie and left me wanting more. And not in a good way. The acting is decent, the sets are believable, and the writing is...alright. I only found one thing laughable in the movie and that was the Pepsi product placement. If you enjoy zombie movies and are wanting a new one, I'd recommend this to you.

All in all, it could have been a truly great movie.And I can't figure out how this movie could have a $200M production budget. There isn't much of ""action"" that shows a well spent $200M (like in the Michael Bay Transformer movies). On a lighter note, if it were the US army/CIA and not the UN, this movie could have been made with $50M instead of $200M.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

What I really can understand is the difficulty to categorize this flick. I just should file it under post apocalyptic, not a straight horror.To call it a horror it should be scary or for a zombie flick maybe even gory but none of that is here to find. We have seen it all before, flicks with major names trying to make a horror but failing in the fact that people who are used to see the big names dropping the flick because it's so-called horror. That's what happened here, Pitt buffs never went to watch it because the zombie theme and horror geeks are into The Walking Dead nowadays full of gore and here we don't have any (no gore and brutality off-camera) so they discard this flick too. Not that it was bad after all, but a lot of zombies are done CGI wise. The quickness of the zombies and the cleverness (climbing over a wall) do makes it a bit creepy but the scene's in dark alleys never makes it scary. Still, post apocalyptic lovers will adore this. It's a nice start for a zombie evening, to watch with the whole family before the children go to sleep and you are plugging in the real stuff.

I've seen a lot of Zombie movies and i'm a big fan of The Walking Dead. I've never read the book to this movie , so i don't have anything to compare in that regard. After watching the trailer to this movie , i have to say i wasn't entirely excited about it. The whole running/ant-like movement of these zombies didn't seem to fit what i like about zombie movies. This movie just looked like it was going to be just another action movie with zombies inserted in as the antagonist. I wasn't to thrilled about Brad Pitt playing the lead role either. I like Brad Pitt , he is a good actor , but just hard to see him in this role. So as you can see i had some mixed feelings going into this movie. Well after finally seeing the movie, there was one word that best described this movie for me - ""incomplete"". I felt like this was the beginning of a story (and perhaps it is). If i knew for certain that this movie was a part 1 of ? then the movie would have given me more closure.

As I said, the entire story is somewhat unbelievable. When I first read about zombies as a kid there was always some supernatural/magic stuff involved. I think I liked that ""explanation"" much better than the virus nonsense which just have too many holes in it. For example there is no way a virus could make human bodies roam around aimlessly inside a sterile laboratory for days without nutrition. Well, as I said, it is a zombie movie so one just have to get over these little issues.As an action movie with zombies as the main adversary it is a fairly good movie. The action is solid, the special effects okay and the entire movie continues at a reasonably brisk pace. Pitt is also doing a decent job of his role. There are few of the other actors that are very memorable though. The scenes where the zombies pile onto each other to scale walls and even reach choppers are rather cool. The movie is not very gory for being a zombie movie. Whether that is a good thing or not depends on the viewer I guess. Personally I do not mind some gory stuff in zombie movies.There are a few annoying parts which Hollywood always seem to have to throw in. For example, the world is on the brink of the apocalypse and Lane and his wife just doesn't want to get involved. What the f? Also why do people always let their kids wander away in situations where they really should keep track of them? Not to mention how clumsy people always get when they have to sneak around and be silent. These things are just annoying.Anyway, this movie fulfils its purpose as two hours of action-filled but not too intelligent entertainment quite well.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

There are also critics who suggest this is a fine film that should have been called something other than World War Z. Maybe so.Regardless, I thought this film was tense, smart, real, and thoroughly engrossing. The action starts about 3 minutes after the opening credits and doesn't let up. Brad Pitt reminded me of John McClane from Die Hard in his inventiveness and smart, straight-ahead thinking. He is very practical and logical in his actions - he just doesn't have the clever one-liners.This film has a high opinion of the human spirit - higher than I do - and a keen sense of politics. It doesn't feel rushed, even though it clocks in at a brisk 116 minutes.I enjoyed Star Trek, This Is The End, and liked Man Of Steel, despite that film's problems. This is the only summer film so far that I have admired.","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

Every week apparently this year Hollywood is throwing at us how the world will end or change in different versions...be it Man Of steel fighting ZOD or the dud After earth or upcoming Pacific Rim. The tendency is to give u a big blockbuster action packed visual feat where the world is at stake. After a while action without purpose tends becomes repetitive and if u always get what u expect and have seen before then what's the purpose of watching a new film anyway i say? This is where exactly ""World War Z"" differs, u do have action scenes, big visuals but not at the expense of the story, it serves as way to forward the story instead the other way around. Zombies and gore are something we have seen umpteen number of times but to see how this particular Zombie situation could actually turn things around the globe in a split second around without gorge is more of an achievement i would say than a let down. Brad Pitt is more than just a pretty lad, he has somewhat an enigmatic presence on screen which keeps u hooked, u do connect with him at some level and think that gosh if the world did need some1 to save it from Zombies (since no superhero here or avengers would b useful here) u would want to have Brad Pitt be that man on your side!His search for a solution to the Zombie problem is pretty much the crux of the story.There are a few shock moments which does make u jump in the seat though 3d is pretty much wasted an useless. I haven't read the book so cant draw a conclusion but in my experience besides Lord of the Rings books always tends to be better than the movie itself, so i would say its a blessing in disguise if u haven't read the book! Not often can a whole family go and see a Zombie flick which is pretty much Rated R but this 1 actually is PG13 which makes it that rare kinda scary movie a family of 4 could go and see together which i guess is also a bonus. The movie does have its faults and could certainly be better but the fact that in the roughly 2hr runtime of the movie the story constantly moves ahead with a purpose and doesn't drag it feet is what in the end makes it watchable and is the real icing on the cake! Don't be 1 of those blokes always looking for gore & over d top action & give the story a chance & u will enjoy it otherwise u will come out cribbing!To wrap it up i would like to say this movie is more personnel in the form of a blockbuster which doesn't happen 2 often now days!","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

However, World War Z ends up being a really satisfactory movie. The directing has glimpses of quality and Brad Pitt is very well as the United Nations employee that travels the world looking for a possible cure. The movie is very tense from the beginning until the end delivering with quality what it promises: pure suspenseful entertainment. What I feared the most about this flick was the use of CGI for the infected zombies. However is does not go any farther than what the (very bad and totally misleading) trailer shows. World War Z does not use any gore either, choosing closed settings to build up the tension, and exploring the world's reaction to this plague in very different countries, which is interesting. Character development is a weak point tough, compared to the likes of 28 Days Later or even Dawn of the Dead. Even so, you will have a really great time with this one, and that's the only thing that matters in World War Z.

A threat to the World has come upon the human race. The clock is ticking as some of the planet's greatest minds attempt to resolve this ultimate threat. Brad Pitt, an investigator for the United Nations, is tasked with defining the problem and stopping it in its tracks. Leaving his family behind, he sets out across the World to look for answers to a problem that may have no answer or does it? He drops into numerous countries, yet by the time he arrives its too late to help. Elements of the pending catastrophe become clearer as he moves through his assigned tasks. Brad Pitt gives a fine performance. His costars flesh out the darkness looming over the World with sequences of better than average acting. This movie needs to be observed closely. There is so much action occurring simultaneously, you may need to watch it more than once to realize the total story being told on the screen. In a few interval scenes I had some trouble understanding the plot, but it becomes more clear with each passing section. I recommend this move to those who enjoy sci-fi or enjoy movies with many plot twists.

Zombie movies have always been a B-grade type of movie. The cheap production values fitted well with the apocalyptic horror of the genre. Add to this the fact that every zombie drama has pretty much the same main plot, and it's a recipe for easily making hundreds of movies which are fairly indistinguishable from each other.The only innovations in zombie movies have come in zombie-comedies, which are often parodies of zombie dramas. Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead are the best examples of these. Warm Bodies was probably the most original zombie movie since the first one, as it took a very different tact. Plus, it was half-comedy.Plot-wise, World War Z isn't anything new. Where WWZ is different is that it has A-grade production values and a mega-name star. Take those away and it could be just another zombie movie.This said, the special effects and other big-budget features do help. The scale of the movie is huge, and makes the production seem so real. Makes you think that what happens in WWZ could well happen in real life.Performance-wise, Brad Pitt does his usual action-hero plus caring- family-man routine, and does it well. His appearance must have used up almost the entire acting budget, as there are no other big names in the movie (unless you are a fan of The Thick of It: good to see Peter Capaldi land a Hollywood role). David Morse, Matthew Fox and Moritz Bleibtrau have minor roles.Reasonably entertaining, but nothing special.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It gave a vulnerable feel to the main characters and that you can't necessarily guarantee a getaway when their faster than a marathon runner. The ending and resolve left one with hope as it was intended in the story as a whole. I will definitely purchase it when it comes out.

Our need for speed has become insatiable. Never is it more apparent than in the zombie genre. The dead are no longer walking. Today's zombies have been redesigned for maximum efficiency. Danny Boyle's ground-breaking 2003 horror classic, 28 Days Later energized that genre, and so does this skillfully-made offering entitled World War Z, the latest apocalyptic cautionary tale in a long line of disaster-oriented movies this summer. (This year's primary theme has showcased the bleakest possible view of our future and paraded those films before us with very mixed results.)In WWZ, the scenario takes a global look at the zombie fever as we hopscotch to various locations (Philadelphia, Jerusalem, Korea, Wales). The virus cannot be contained and we are almost immediately classified in Code Red epidemic level. The film is Contagion revisited as a horror genre exercise in terror. Gone are the slow-moving brain munchers, monsters one could outwit and out-walk in the past. This newer model is fully equipped with a metaphysical souped-up V-6 engine and can travel at breakneck speed, literally speaking. These undead are the new fast and furious with a ""yum,yum eat 'em up"" attitude.Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a United Nations investigator who is trying to find a cure to stop this pandemic. But first he must somehow manage to get his own family out of harm's way before confronting the problem head-on. Throughout the film, Gerry is put in action hero mode, having to be brave and resourceful as he faces off against the attacking hordes in an effort to discover the virus' origin and stop this epidemic. The reasons why Gerry is the world's only savior and foremost zombie exterminator remain unclear, but it is Brad Pitt after all. Who else can save the world when Tom Hanks isn't available?Meanwhile, the zombies swarm, multiply, and destroy what is left of human mankind, like crazed Walmart shoppers on a typical Black Friday rush (and just as terrifying). Director Marc Forster seems more concerned about CGI effects and creating horrific tension. He sets up one action sequence after the next to insure full audience interest and stages those set pieces quite effectively. (Particularly memorable are the siege at the fortress sequence and an in- flight zombie encounter that is edited for maximum tension and a scene involving ) The gore factor is surprisingly low by today's standards, which might disappoint some hard-core horror aficionados, but I applaud the filmmaker's restraint. WWZ is a fast moving and suspenseful diversion. Production values are all first-rate with special kudos to the sound effects editing team and Marco Beltrami's seamless musical score. However, the film spends hardly any time on character development or much narrative. Pitt carries off his role well, within the limits of the script that is more invested in pumping up the adrenaline rush than emphasizing the personal dramas and dilemmas of its characters. The talented Mirelle Enos as his wife, Karin, is not given enough screen time to help build more emotional impact as are many secondary characters who tend to be dispatched the moment they arrive on the scene. (Was that Matthew Fox who delivered one line of throwaway dialog or was my vision impaired?)But World War Z is essentially an action/horror movie that delivers much of its thrills and excitement due to Forster's vision as a director and the film's strong visual imagery. Seeing this film on the big screen will only enhance the movie-going experience. And if the world's gotta end, well, at least Brad Pitt is there for good company.

This worried me at the beginning. However, the movie was surprisingly good but could have been better. This film is nothing like the book and I feel like they should have named this movie something else that way someone else could make a real World War Z. This movie doesn't do anything new or groundbreaking, but parents will appreciate the minimal gore in this movie. However, this could also be viewed as a negative and might disappoint some of the more mature viewers. It tries to be smart and suspenseful and almost succeeds, but falls short. There is some nice acting and it does divert from a few clichés but there are still many throughout the film. Overall I would say that this movie is not a waste of your money, but you shouldn't expect anything too spectacular.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The film, which seems 20 minutes too long, has some clever ideas but quite a few unrealized ones. The strongest sell for this film is that, despite some uncomfortably boring moments and some unconvincing acting, it comes back with big, juicy scenes that keep you excited. Many films fail at that and the audience walks away feeling half-disappointed even with the pluses. The early scenes with the family and the mismatched reactions they have to ""the end of the world,"" somehow makes one feel like the family dynamic was unnecessary. No one reacted correctly to the sudden annihilation of mankind. I mean, not one person even said ""What the hell is happening?"" They all seemed like they had been through something like this once before. It's not like zombies take over the planet every day. The children are poorly written as characters. If I saw my parents half eaten by zombies, I'd be in a screaming fetal position for weeks. But Tomas is as unshaken as if he merely lost reception on his iPhone. And the outcome to the crashing airplane is stupidly unbelievable even for a film that's supposed to be unbelievable. The scenes in Israel are stunning and luckily, when you think the film is falling under it's own weight, they bring back visually powerful scenes to make up for it. You'll have to forgive them some for the flaccid ending which seems written 5 times. The points made at the end are even repeated. But, even with the trouble it has, it surprisingly keeps you entertained and convinced, which, especially with the overblown groaners they've spit out this summer, is hopeful.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I can say that I am not a person who have read the book/books and can judge from that aspect, however, you cannot change the fact that I went to watch the movie only to be grossed and entertained and ended up so, in a positive way if you could say.Some people hated the movie because it was not true to the books and missed a lot of good things. But people you should know by now that books are always better than the movies(a reader creates a world in his mind that no other person can imitate) you can never expect a producer to make scenes exactly as you wish. Nor can you find every thrilling scene(you loved) to be in the movie. This movie wanted and needed to be a blockbuster and the fact-that it became one but did not fit the normal sort of sci-fi fantasy far fetched movies-made it a favorite for me.The climax was different from expected and what is better than to be intrigued by the producers choice for an ending, this is what you will get from the movie - something to think about.What truly scares me that this time an apocalyptic movie seemed really doable and something that can happen to us any moment. The first thing I asked my friends after watching it was ""what kind of an illness will look the most plausible to a zombie Apocalypse"" and will even Jerusalem be safe from it, because I truly believe that Jeursalem is the third world Power and our next high commander, before forming a ""New World Order"" the ones on top will find an inexpensive way to get rid of half the population of the World, make an infestation and find a cure for the privileged ones- not us ofc, we are doomed :D","12 out of 24 found this helpful.

On the other hand, the movie is rushing things, too fast, no chance for characters developments... You don't feel attached to them. Plot gap, if we can see, in many turning points of the movie..

I was very pleasantly surprised. (unlike Prometheus where I very unpleasantly surprised!) It's not your usual xbox style kill everything in sight blood and guts, pass out from boredom zombie type movie. It's not really a zombie movie. The pace was good. Maybe a tad fast but the movie was 2 hours. 3 hours would have made it epic. It could easily have been 3 hours long. The problem with these movies is they try and fit a lot into a short period of time. Inevitable corners are going to be cut to get to the punchline. The storyline was plausible. Bizarely the only character that didn't make much sense was Brad Pitt's. Not sure who or what the guy was supposed to be. All they had to do was make him some sort of hot shot military scientist or Doctor and voilà, everything would have fallen into place. That said if you just except the character and pretend he's a Doctor or something the movie is a very entertaining watch. If you have seen the trailer. You definitely have not seen the movie! Some reviewers try and spot mistakes and errors in the movie or inconsistencies. All movies have this. So what? If it doesn't really affect the story what do I care. It's not an exam. If you want details maybe you should try reading a book...","14 out of 29 found this helpful.

At the same time, I must admit that whilst expectations were low the film was made in a way that kept us engaged throughout and there were moment of very heightened tension.Despite this, unlike Contagion, it left me largely uninterested and hope Brad Pitt will resume making the good films he has accustomed us to.","6 out of 20 found this helpful.

Just enjoy the ride on the film's terms and you'll be fine. And I actually like the idea of a PG-13 Zombie flick rather than R rated. I don't care about the excessive gore that R rating allows.

What an unfair advantage now in their favor considering the lumbering gait was the only thing that provided some level of protection for the human race. This year has been evolutionary for the zombie, since we now also know from Warm Bodies that there's even zombie love. There is some consistency in what has been the recent approach to zombification, it starts with some fatal contagion, not like the good old days when a vampire enslaves a human which keeps the numbers low, or a voodoo casting or the result of some improperly contained hazardous chemical, now everything is a virus run rampant. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) is a United Nations employee and is reactivated to track down the invading agent and try to figure out how to stop it. I don't know what UN employees do and after this film I still don't. There was a segment where Gerry is sent to accompany mankind's best hope for finding a cure and I'm not sure if he was supposed to be some level of protection but the situation just got direr rather than better. My favorite aspect about the story aside from Mr. Pitt of course is what puts the human race at its greatest disadvantage, the speed of the zombies. The special effects that allowed for them to climb atop each other and perform record breaking tackles added to the intensity. Although the movement and feel seemed very similar to the creations from I Am Legend, it was still rather chilling to watch as the human race was quickly being annihilated. My biggest complaint about the story is that I left the theater with no greater insight into what was the intrusive culprit than I had already gathered from the previously mentioned trailer that it's a contaminating virus with unknown origins and is aggressively spreading. I did not find this story particularly scary but it did pass my 3-D test, yes I flinched, actually a few times. I just kept thinking keep that guy Gerry away, because it just seemed that wherever he was the zombie infestation grew. That may not have been the reality since the problem was supposedly worldwide, but as good as Mr. Pitt looked as 'every man', he was bad luck for everybody except himself. I liked the film, but felt as if too much was given away in the trailer, therefore I give it an amber light.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Out of the blue, they witness several car crashes caused by the attack of hordes of zombies. Gerry runs with his family and he steals and drives a RV, heading to Newark, New Jersey. Gerry calls his old friend, UN Secretary General Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena), who promises to send a helicopter on the next morning to rescue Gerry and his family. Gerry stops at a supermarket to get supplies and medicine for his asthmatic daughter and the RV is stolen. They flee to an apartment building and a Latin family helps them, lodging the family in their apartment.On the next morning, Gerry invites the family to go with them to the roof, but they prefer to stay in their apartment. However they are attacked by zombies and the boy Tommy joins Gerry and his family in their runaway. The helicopter brings them to an aircraft carrier anchored offshore New York City and Gerry is assigned to travel to South Korea with the virologist Dr. Andrew Fassbach (Elyes Gabel)to seek out the patient zero to develop a vaccine. When the team arrives at the base, they are attacked by zombies and Fassbach panics and has a fatal accident. Gerry has a conversation with an insane ex-CIA agent (David Morse) that is imprisoned and he goes to Jerusalem to talk to the Director of Mossad Jurgen Warmbrunn (Ludi Boeken) to learn why he built a wall and transformed the city in a safe zone. When Jerusalem is attacked by a horde of zombies, Gerry observes that the zombies do not attack terminally ill persons. Now he travels with his escort Segen (Daniella Kertesz) to a research facility in Wales to disclose his findings to the scientists.""World War Z"" is a refreshing zombie movie, with a tense story full of action. I know that the movie is not faithful to the novel, but the plot is a combination of zombies and virus movies and entertains. The characters are likable and the special effects are top-notch. Matthew ""Jack Shepherd"" Fox is wasted with a minor role but in accordance with a research in internet, his character would have an important role in ""World War Z"", having an affair with Gerry's wife and taking care of his family during his journey seeking a cure to the epidemic. The dark ending, with Karin trading her body to survive, was changed by Paramount to a commercial (and probably better) conclusion. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Guerra Mundial Z"" (""World War Z"")Note: On 01 October 2023, I saw this film again.","23 out of 53 found this helpful.

The film states that he's had experience in battle before so he knows his stuff but as of now he's abandoned that profession...so why do they need him when they have perfectly able marines and seals on hand?Additionally, World War Z continuously switches between the enemy being 'infected' or 'zombies' or 'undead'. They are not undead. Undead is where they were previously dead and have been reanimated. They're just zombies. The bite transmission kind. You don't actually see anyone get killed by an infected person.Also, this film was so evidently rushed. At one point Gerry is in South Korea, and then a moment later he's on a plane to Israel. The action scenes last five minutes each and the action involved is short lived and predictable. In fact, Gerry is hardly involved in the action scenes. If you're looking for a zombie film which will thrill you, this film is not what you are looking for. Action is weak, there is no gore, the story is pointless, all of the characters are pretty much expendable...it's amazing it can even be rated as a 15. World War Z. Z, being the sound produce by the audience.","40 out of 89 found this helpful.

Its like they took a zombie movie and tried to make it bigger and better. Sure it was a good movie with some high quality effects and acting. It was also not boring at all, nor was it the same old zombie thing.. However it was missing something I couldn't quite put my finger on. It was good and I really wanted to like it a lot, All the way to the end I wanted to like it but is was missing a zombie movie quality. Maybe because it didn't seem that scary? maybe because there were too many zombies that i was desensitized?Anyways I will watch it again on DVD or HBO to see what I think about it then. Even though it was a fast moving movie I found myself thinking about work, thinking about my kids or what to have for dinner. It didn't quite have that zombie movie grip on my mind where nothing could distract me til it was over. (Did anyone else get that same feeling) Hmmmmmmm It was almost a great movie","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

The action scenes were was above average scenes and the zombies look like regular zombies with less blood up-close but when they run around in those weird groups they look like ants or something but i liked that idea. For all of those people who didn't like it because it wasn't like the book you should know by now that movies that are based of books aren't really like the books most of the time so you shouldn't be surprised when a movies aren't like the book nowadays.

Given the buzz- or lack thereof- I was understandably tentative, but was quickly sucked in by the film's grand scale and penchant for genuine horror. Having seen the finished product, the matter is no longer up for debate; World War Z is unlike any film of its genre before it. Endlessly marketed as another snooze fest holiday blockbuster, it is actually a taut, engrossing thrill ride seasoned with merciless, edge-of-your-seat terror, the likes of which haven't graced the big screen for a long time.Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former UN representative who gets called back into work courtesy of a virus that has rapidly turned most of the earth's population into a soulless, superhuman race of ravenous zombies. In his worldwide search for answers, Lane faces all comers head-on in an environment that would compel even the most reckless Marine to bail with a resounding 'Nope!' before word of the outbreak hits the evening news.Virtually every supporting character is useless, from Lane's inconvenient wife to his irritating children, but it doesn't even matter. Pitt carries the film with a grounded performance, crafting a rational, believable character that so deftly toes the line between the invincible action hero and the out-of-his-element everyman. Forster made the right decision injecting a main character instead of following the scattered journal entry format of Max Brooks' novel, giving the film the accessibility it needs to be successful without resembling a carbon copy of every blockbuster this side of the 3D revolution.And it is on that point that World War Z excels. Anyone expecting a fun but forgettable romp ablaze with heavy artillery and indiscriminate loss of life is likely to cop a pleasant shock. This is not to suggest that the film doesn't cater to the mass market. On the contrary, each set piece just gets progressively more ambitious, making a glowing spectacle of the film's $200 million budget, but it is the moments of deathly silence that are most effective and, ironically, most likely to turn the event into a holistic cinema experience; one in which you and 300 fellow viewers can uniformally share your inner cowardice amidst nervous laughter and clenched fists, jaws and many other parts of the human anatomy. Here is a film that has grabbed every potential setback by the scruff of the neck, thrown it across the room with the force of an undead army, and nonchalantly delivered a jaw-dropping masterclass in suspense for its troubles.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

The film was just horrible, the story was awful, the casting was awful, the shooting was awful, and the special effect was mediocre.First, let us talk about Brad Pitt. I loved Fight Club, watched Troy, and Mr. & Mrs. Smith. I had not, saw him acted so badly like in this film before. There were too many scenes that he should be looking at the other directions rather then glimpse over to the camera or stare at it. Poor performance.Second, what's up with the vending machine in the end? How much did a drink company paid for the film to add the obvious subliminal message of ""drink this s*** and your life will be good?"" I thought I was watching a TV commercial from Asia rather than a zombie movie!The plot was horrible. The protagonist fly from one place to the other like......an investigator.. which was his job description in the UN. But this is what actually went wrong with the movie. It is suppose to be a zombie movie, not a poorly written Sherlock Holmes, where every trance of hint was too obvious to discover.Further, the supporting character has no story of their own. What makes a movie or a book great was that there were many minor stories hidden within a big story and somehow they were all related. We saw this in Max Brook's book World War Z, but not in the movie itself.About the book... all I can say the book was a zombie classic, while the movie was a disgraceful disaster. It has nothing resembling to the book. If a person read the book, there are already pictures, images, and stories that filled up a person's mind. At least several movies could be made out of the book with each of them focused on few related person's story and their view point regarding the World War Z. The Japanese, the Eastern Europeans, the America soldiers, the Chinese doctors, the battle of Yonkers... etc. But the film didn't do it, they have to be creative to a way that made the film tasteless and cheesy.I mentioned previously that the special effect were mediocre. As I reflect more about the special effect, I decided to change my mind. The special effect was horrible. Good special effect integrated into the scenes that makes you feel inside the movie without noticing the special effect was at work. For World War Z, you can tell specific effect from beginning to end. Dead people became zombie and sudden gained a extreme stamina boost that made them jump and tackle people like professional athletes, absolutely ridiculous. Even worst, you can see special effect cut in right the way during the tackling. Horrible, horrible special effect.The supporting actors also acted poorly. Most actors who played zombies were merely acting, and the end of a joke. The zombies in the lab were performed by actors who simply acts without getting into the roles.The actors who played the soldiers, the wife, the scientists... also acted poor. From the beginning to the end you just can't help to notice that they are ""acting"", which is the poorest performance done any actor. When an audience can tell that you are acting and not drawn into the story, then you have failed as an actor.The movie itself was a horror movie, watching a zombie classic by Max Brook turned into a joke surely horrified many zombie fans. The movie itself was not worthy to get your movie money. Best wait till it went on Netflix or borrow from your friend's DVD collection - if he was so into collecting that he didn't care about the content of the film.","44 out of 100 found this helpful.

The fate of humanity hangs in the balance as he scours the planet trying to stay alive and keep his family safe.

Forster seamlessly ties in the grand locations and manic pace with the intensity of the film leaving the audience at the edge of their seat for the most part. In spite of having a good idea of the outcome, you still find yourself rooting for Pitt's character. Although the visuals is the real star of the film, Brad Pitt performs expectedly well while his wife, Mireille Enos from The Killing and Big Love fame, plays her role adequately. Although not an epic and a tad predictable, World War Z is definitely an entertaining blockbuster that ranks among one of the better Zombie films. This is undoubtedly one to watch and enjoy!","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Turns out it's only decent. I came into this film thinking it's a zombie film in a much more grand scale. Now that I've seen it, I now know that I came in expecting too much from it.This film was based off a novel of the same name, which I haven't read so I came into this blind in plot. The film's plot is quite straight forward and doesn't take a genius to understand the goal of Pitt's character but what made this film feel a little flat is the stakes. In a zombie or apocalypse film, usually there would be more than one guy that the film is following and with that focus, the characters then have a sense of weight to them if a soul is lost but in this film there isn't a lot of people to care about aside from Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt). I understand that this film shows a much bigger picture than intimate survival films like Dawn of the Dead but at least those films had characters that means more to us as an audience if they die. I see the tragedy and horror of the situation but these are people seen from a distance and they feel expendable. The film's ending may seem underwhelming but it makes sense as zombie films never truly have a defining conclusions, it usually ends with everyone dead or stuck somewhere hoping someone will save them. This film feels like the first step in fixing the issue and needs at least a second film to tie up the loose ends. The film though has it's strengths. I love that it still had it's suspenseful moments and that it didn't really focus on the killing for survival but rather the search for a cure in order to survive. Overall, the film's story feels like a mixture of Soderbergh's ""Contagion"" and Emmerich's ""2012"".Marc Forster has proved that he could make action with Quantum of Solace but so far his films with high amounts of action have been not so strong with it's core story and this film is another example but his work on the simpler dramas like Stranger Than Fiction and Finding Neverland seem to receive more positive responses. His efforts here is not horrible though, it's just not up there with his better films. I like the fact that the film has large moments, the attack on Israel, and frightening small moments, World Health Organisation in Wales. The film doesn't feel deep and with a film like this with such ambition, it would have benefited from it.The cinematography feels very generic and is an aspect of the film that won't be remembered. It does what it does, captures the image and creates some sort of tension, but I hoped for a film like this that it would be a little darker and moody.Beltrami's score was fantastic in films like The Hurt Locker and Resident Evil because they create this dark mood that supports the film. Surprisingly for a film that focuses on zombies, it feels more like a action film which at the same time is unsurprisingly as the moments with tension is very fast paced and exciting. The scenes at the WHO centre or the refueling of the plane was fantastic, the times where the film are at their most suspenseful and dark.I have no issues with the acting in this film, my issue is that the screenplay doesn't flesh out these characters enough that anybody besides Pitt could show off their acting range. Brad Pitt, as always is fantastic, but this type of film doesn't really try to challenge actors in showing their skills. The supporting cast were fine but wish was used a little more.Definitely won't be up there along with my favorite Zombie or Apocalyptic film of all time but it's good enough for me to watch again when it comes out on Blu-Ray or DVD just to pick up on things I may have not picked up in the story. I had fun though.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I have to give credit to the trailer for being subtle enough to not ruin the tension. World War Z is an apocalypse movie with plenty of seriousness, incredibly quick pace and neatly hidden scares lurking steadily. The fresh set pieces bring more substance than the usual thrill as they constantly move forward while keeping the audience invested in the journey. Brad Pitt delivers a great performance, the movie can't ask a better protagonist. He displays calmness and desperation with equally refined stature. The whole movie is about this man who keeps getting in life threatening situations without resorting to hulking up to usual action role. It's fascinating to see how he struggles for dear life, and those of others, as he goes through such extreme frays.There are some novel ideas that are inspired by wise internet proverbs ""If it looks stupid but it works, it ain't stupid"". These bits provide more natural survivability to the scene and prevent it from being too silly. Graphical gore and action are well executed, creating threats are seemingly more lively. Gripping sequences are thrown frequently without much delay between them. These captivate audience by steadfastly lurching the action in consistent occurrences.Effect of 3D is somewhat lacking, at least in my experience. Some might not work well, although the graphic prowess of the movie itself if certainly above average. The way it changes setting is remarkably done, providing sense of progress as it goes along. One minor complaint I have is the ending is a bit bland, it doesn't conclude or wrap the movie in any significant way. Seeing the scale of the crisis, it's understandable for not being resolved instantaneously, but it feels less interesting that the previous parts of the movie and a bit prelude for sequel.World War Z is a frantic fast-paced fervid ride, and it's even more so if you watch it without any prior knowledge of the movie.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

A zombie movie for the squeamish who don't want to see a small intestine whilst chewing on their popcorn.I love the music and scale of destruction shown. Instead of a close up of several zombies nagging into flesh, we get viral waves of chaos across several time zones.Into the maelstrom steps our reluctant hero, Gerry (Pitt). Recently retired from an unknown role in the United Nations, Gerry is pressed into service to act as the chaperone to the scientific effort to combat the puzzling virus.Bouncing from the US, to Korea, the Levant and UK, our ever observant hero works to solve the puzzle in a unique way.If you like your zombie movies full of gore, you may be disappointed. I don't hate gore, it's just some movies rely too much on it. If your triggered by acronyms like UN or WHO you'll love to hate this, but if you want to see a different take on the zombie genre I'd recommend.A convenient plane crash perhaps the only flaw (along with a convenient syringe), but extra kudos for giving the jacked Matthew Fox a role to shine in.Finally a zombie movie you can watch over dinner. And finally, a hero called Gerry!","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's smart at times and yet it makes the same cliché mistakes that many of zombie movies tend to make. In World War Z zombies no longer turn people into undead flesh eaters, but it's a virus like Swine flu or Sars, it moves from host to host infecting them. No one is safe but if it's a virus there must be a cure. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) is the U.N. investigator who is called in to find and root out the virus. Going around the world chasing leads from South Korea to Israel to find the potential cure. There were time in the movie that seem so foolish and an obvious set ups for zombie attacks that it took away some of the charm of the movie. Randomly phone ringing when making a dash for safety, zombies hiding in the closest, kicking the cans in an empty hallway, and random Arab girl leading a celebratory song in Israel on a loud speaker, when it has been established that zombies are attracted by loud noises. World War Z is an intense ride that picks up within the first 5 in of the movie and doesn't stop till the very end. There were slow points but they were necessary because they gave us some background story. The fast zombies worked in this movie, they were first introduced in 28 Days Later and this movie uses them appropriately. World War Z is yet another movie that shows how fragile the society is and how quickly people turn to anarchy and looting. When facing impending doom how will you react? Will you follow the rules or do whatever it takes to survive?I give World War Z 7 deadly zombie bites out of 10.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The trailers for this and the marketing emphasising mass terror in all major cities got me quite excited. This movie will not blow you away, nor will it win any awards. That said, it isn't a bad movie and I left with a strong feeling of satisfaction. In a word, this movie is ""good"". It has moments of tenseness, but is never scary, which for a zombie movie is very disappointing. I guess that is due to the age rating, which allows it to be viewed by a larger audience rather than your average die-hard gore fiend. The special effects in some places (not often) is abundantly clear and looks hurried and this is never a good thing in a movie. Characters are good, though Brad Pitt's character has more than his share of luck. You do feel for them, but I personally think this is down to the actors than amazing characterisation. It would have been useful to have explored the devastation around the world in greater depth rather than just cities that are visited. The chaos caused to humanity is never fully explored and limited to dialogue. If you want a scare and gore, then this isn't the film for you. If however you want to see a good, entertaining movie, then this is a must.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

The film's rapid escalation of the zombie pandemic and its heart-pounding music add to the excitement. The transformation of zombies is impressively portrayed, creating a sense of fear and chaos. The movie's realistic portrayal of how the military handles the crisis brings a sense of authenticity often lacking in zombie films. The solid resolution to the infection sets it apart from other movies in the genre.However, while the film is gripping, more jump scares could have heightened the suspense even further. The implausible scene where the main character's plane leaves Jerusalem without him feels a bit contrived. Additionally, the main character's phone battery seems to be conveniently unreliable, which could have been better executed to maintain the tension.Despite these minor flaws, ""World War Z"" remains an engaging and refreshing addition to the zombie genre. Its relentless pace, chilling transformation sequences, and intriguing take on a global pandemic keep viewers on the edge of their seats. With a few improvements, it could have been even more terrifying, but overall, it offers a satisfying and adrenaline-fueled cinematic experience.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Some film adaptations stray from the book, this one used nothing more than the title. However, out of sheer financial power, the resulting film comes across as a fast-paced, slickly produced action-adventure movie. The badly-coiffed (was he growing out his hair for a future role while filming) plays generic good-guy: smart, paternal, intrepid and, as always, good-looking. His globe-trotting would have exhausted James Bond as he searches for a way to quell a zombie (and is there a more stupid concept?) outbreak. Violating George Romero's prime directive, director Marc Forster's zombies in this particular outbreak run and are pretty scary when provoked. However, when not in attack mode the actors forced to play them look distractedly unsure what they are supposed to be doing - some stand still while others bang their heads against parts of the set and others nash their teeth in what is supposed to be intimidating but is mostly just dopey. Maybe give them some clearer direction Marc? Speaking of zombie rules, apparently helicopters don't count as noise as we see in Fort Israel but singing (and everything else) does (if a zombie crashes into something does that send all the others running?) Of course, you can complain ad nauseam about the plot and logic but you have to give it up for the expensive looking and engaging set pieces most of them involving plans or helicopters. Although the movie decidedly decelerates and loses its big bucks sheen in the final act, the non-stop, edge-to-edge excitement entertains up to that point. In short, the cliché' is to impress people by saying the book was better, if anyone tells you that here you know they didn't read it given the film bears not even a passing resemblance.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The movie frequently substitutes impressive CGI shots of zombie swarms for storytelling. The rushed ending feels cheap, and fans of Brooks' source material are going to wonder what happened.

The set design of this film felt grandeur and spectacular, which I felt was great but it inhibited some much needed emotional human moments. Something this film had plenty of were jump scares, which can only be seen as effective in a zombie movie. I did like the realistic tone that was present throughout, making me believe that a zombie outbreak could really happen. Unlike I Am Legend, I thought the way World War Z solved this global catastrophe was believable and eye- opening. Of course the star of World War Z is Brad Pitt, and he does a great job in my opinion portraying the character. My real problem is with the actual character itself. It seems as if this guy is invincible and can overcome any obstacle that comes in his way. I didn't read the book so I'm not sure if that's how the character is written, but it did draw me out of the movie at times. The ending felt very rushed which did affect my grade of the movie; however this is a solid film with more style than substance.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

What do you expect from ""World War Z""? What the hell are you supposed to expect? I asked my partner, ""Do you want to watch World War Z with me?"" She went, ""Nooo,"" because she was convinced this was a war movie. The truth is that this is a much better movie than its title. The plot is not particularly original. Brad Pitt + worldwide zombie epidemic. That's the plot. Oh yes, stuff happens alright, but very little of it is noteworthy. What this movie is really about is the spectacle. The action is well spread throughout the movie, and when it kicks in, it is intense. The camera work is nice and varied, from chaotic close-ups of wrestling zombies to those expensive overhead flying shots. There are a lot of different locations and faces and guns and chaos and zombies, oh my, are there a lot of zombies. You get a feeling this movie tries to be epic and it mostly succeeds.There are quite a few actors that make an appearance and all contribute a good performance. It's a shame the contributions are short. It is mostly Brad Pit carrying the film on his shoulders, and I suppose if you are paying a guy like him then of course you want to give him a lot of screen time, but it is a shame that none of the other people stick around for long enough to make us remember them. They show up out of nowhere and disappear into the background. There is a somewhat memorable Israili woman that serves as main character's partner while Brad's wife character is not around, but that is about it.The main problem is still the plot. I suppose it is hard to make a disaster or horror movie that does not have plot problems. It is not just that the outline is simplistic. The narrative in World War Z is a bumpy ride with convenient events and nonsensical science. It feels like the world, the laws of physics and the entire space–time continuum revolve around the superman Brad Pit as it suits his cause. On the bright side, the plot is not predictable. Quite a few things happen that I did not see coming.Despite the problems with the plot, it is still a great action spectacle though and definitely worth seeing.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But no more. Yes, it seems that in the 45 years of existence that zombies have had on the big screen, they've evolved from shuffling corpses to monsters who pose a real threat. Danny Boyle taught them how to run, and made them more of a virus that we can recognise than cadavers craving brains. So now, zombies have gone global. Not just in popularity, although in that regard they certainly have with the help of AMC's The Walking Dead (amongst others), but they have swept across the globe. And only Brad Pitt can save us.After about three years in development hell, where there were more script re-writes and cast and crew shuffling about than you could keep up with, World War Z is finally here. Based on Max Brooks' multi-layered and heavily satirical novel that is told from the points of view of many different characters that reside throughout the globe, World War Z was always going to be a hard sell. Zombies are all the rage so naturally Hollywood wants to get their fat fingers on their piece of the pie, meaning World War Z was going to be a blockbuster. So, is it the giant pile of rotting brains that most fans were expecting, proving incoherent due to the many changes made throughout production? Surprisingly, no, and in fact it proves to be almost relentlessly entertaining.After an array of obligatory news-reel footage foreshadowing the upcoming apocalypse, Gerry Lane (Pitt), a former UN employee, with his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and two daughters are stuck in Philadelphia traffic when the zombie attacks explode on the streets. They are saved when a helicopter ordered by an old friend of Gerry's, Deputy Secretary- General Umutoni (Fana Mokoena), flies them to a U.S. Navy vessel in the Atlantic. Gerry is then persuaded to search for the source of the cure when it is made clear that he and his family will be booted off the vessel if he refuses. His journey will span the globe from South Korea to Jerusalem to, most oddly, Wales.It's a flimsy plot to say the least. Most zombie computer games have more depth in the story, so we simply follow Gerry as he trots the globe. But where the film fails in story and character development, it makes up for in some outstanding action scenes. We are no longer in one man versus a horde of zombies mode, this is on a global scale, and when they attack, they attack in a ferocious swarm, piling on top of each other to reach massive heights and when they engage, they fling everything they can at their victim. Director Marc Forster, who proved himself inept at action in the Bond dud Quantum of Solace (2008), redeems himself somewhat with some fine set-pieces. The attack in Israel shows off some stunning CGI, but makes sure Gerry doesn't get lost in the mayhem.Another overwhelming positive is the performance of Brad Pitt, who proves that he can carry a franchise-seeking blockbuster with ease. Even at 50, well past the age you would expect of an action star, he injects his criminally unrecognised acting talents into what is ultimately a thinly-written role, and again shows that there is more to him that simply being really really ridiculously good-looking (to quote Derek Zoolander). The supporting cast either don't get a look in or don't last long enough to make an impact, so Enos, James Badge Dale, Elyes Gabel and Matthew Fox barely register. Fox especially, after having his entire sub-plot cut down to the point that I didn't realise he was in it until the credits rolled.The ending, which was re-wrote by Drew Goddard, reeks of indecision. The original ending, that saw a huge zombie battle in Moscow's Red Square, was canned, probably due to the political undertones of the setting, and the new, more low-key ending, was introduced to give the movie a more satisfying and coherent climax. While by no means a bad ending, for the film to start out global only to shrink to a sneaky one-on-one final note, it's somewhat of an anti-climax. It adds actors Peter Capaldi and Moritz Bleibtreu and offers some hope with a potential cure, but it just feels like everyone on board had no hope for the film. Given World War Z's commercial success, a sequel has now been greenlit (Pitt saw this as a first of a trilogy), so ultimately, the film did what it came to do. The many relatively minor quibbles aside, this is a success. But a film can surely only survive one troubled production shoot, so the people involved with the sequel will need to clear their heads and step up their game.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Having read halfway through the book, the movie is nothing like its book counterpart. For long World War Z was said to be in production hell having issues with directors and budget and naturally I was skeptical about it. Brad Pitt was announced to be the lead but it never came off as a consolation. Marc Forster as a director made it worse for me to accept it. No offence but Quantum Of Solace wasn't a gem of a James Bond movie. I was genuinely concerned as I was a zombie genre fan first and foremost, and wanted it to work out well.I was surprised when I read on IGN that World War Z was not a complete let down. Believe me I had not kept my hopes high for this one so a news like this did revive my hopes for the same.World War Z starts off with Brad Pitt's character Gerry Lane, a former UN personnel stuck in traffic with his family. And without a moment to spare, all hell breaks loose from there. Gerry and his family is put in the midst of the zombie outbreak and along with it, so are you. The first hour or so Gerry is hellbent on taking his family to safety and with his contacts at the UN he does accomplish it but in return he is sent to investigate the source of this zombie outbreak and he goes off on his mission moving from location to another in search of a possible cure.We, as an audience, are just dropped into midst of the ruckus in like 10 minutes. There wasn't much time for character development. Of course horror movies never demand character development but this is not your usual horror flick where characters are used as cannon fodder. In, World War Z, the only character you end up caring about is Gerry and thats about it. Although he has his heart with his family tucked away far from the zombie outbreak, you just don't feel the same. World War Z works out very much like a disaster movie. Think 2012, think The Day After Tomorrow. WWZ plays out exactly so, where instead of natural calamities you have a zombie apocalypse to deal with. It wasn't the zombies thats of interest here, it was the setting which was direly grim. It reminded me a lot of Contagion. That being said this is not the movie for hardcore horror fans and for those who go in expecting to see brain- eating zombies or gore would be disappointed sorely. Its more drama than horror. Then again this ain't a rehashed 28 Days Later. Where 28 Days Later had a solid storyline WWZ falters there a bitthe story of the movie could be encompassed in one paragraph but that owes to the fast pace that it'd got too. Tense moments were aplenty and yes the first as well as the second half of movie does put you at the edge of the your seats. I was never given a moment to breathe. I was either taking deep breaths or keeping my breath in at times of those tense moments. The 12 second zombie-bite-turnover time was what made it tense most of the times. There was this scene where Brad runs to the edge of a building, away from his family, having had zombie brain matter in his mouth and counting to 12 to see if he'd turnit striked to me as ingenious writing. My problem was that it was all too fast. If you watch it individually and as snippets its quite gripping but the team globetrotting their way to find the source of the outbreak felt way too quickWAAAY TOO QUICK! I know my statements could contradict here but this is exactly how I felt.Brad Pitt was awesome as Gerry. The film was solely on Brad Pitt's shoulders and he's put in his best here. A bit of credit could be given to Mireille Enos, she didn't have a lot to do here but she was convincing as Karin Lane. Apart from these two, the only cast members worth mentioning are Daniella Kertesz and Pierfrancesco Favino/Peter Capaldi duo each having the shortest of screentimes ever.Qualms regarding the ending was inevitable. The finale felt very unsatisfactory. The right word would be 'precipitous'. Everything that had it going for the movie was put to an abrupt end. PG 13 hampers the experience a bit. But not completely; all the slashing/hitting and the gore that followed, they were all implied and it makes for some effective scenes as well. the The second half didn't come up to its first counterpart and had serious issues with the pacing, where the first half screamed urgency the second half was more akin to playing a stealth game, taking its sweet time to keeping you in strain.World War Z is good movie but far from perfection. But of course you have to give in to the makers for coming up with something as entertaining as this despite going through the worst of production. It also has an intense score composed by Marco Beltrami. PS: Watch this movie in 2D.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's violent but it is not gory and to me that's refreshing as seeing zombies rip out guys and eat them gets boring. Forster directs the hell out of this too, and it never stops moving.

It's nailed the gritty, vivid tone I expect of a dawning modern zombie apocalypse - the panic, confusion and outright helplessness of civilian life at ground zero - but does gradually get carried away in terms of scope. Brad Pitt as not just humanity's last great scientific hope, but also its vigilant watchdog and bombastic action hero, is something of a reach and smells like several characters were mashed together for the sake of simplicity. In a few instances, World War Z tests the waters of political and social reactions, enduring themes of the novel, but these are contrived token efforts at best and certainly not the film's forte. It's generally content to simply flush the screen with crumbling cityscapes and spitting, sprinting, screaming infected hordes, both of which perform quite well. At moments it's intense, shocking and borderline iconic, but storyline depth is an Achilles' heel, and most of the third act plays out like a bland, predictable obligation.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

On that note, the film is a success because it features a lot of things that will appeal to a great deal of people. However, examining it from a smaller viewpoint, one that analyzes character-investment, development, and layout, one will see a cluttered film that goes on for a long time but never seems to make much progress.Even though I have not read the book, I can't help but feel that the film does something of a disservice to it. If I had not read the novel a film is based on, I try and research the contents and the impact it has garnered in order to provide something of a relatability point. The novel appeared to have contained a wide-variety of characters impacted by a zombie apocalypse, a series of instances that bring up commentary points for contemporary America, and provided readers with a plausible ""what-if"" story about a zombie apocalypse.My immediate question upon viewing World War Z; where was this in the film? Where was the broad focus, the multiple characters, and the points about social and political life as we know it? Even if I'm misinformed about the novel, Brad Pitt's Gerry Lane character and story are still very thin and underdeveloped. If the film has incorporated all of the above, or even half of it, it could've possibly raised the standard for summer blockbusters into shockingly subversive territory. Instead, it sells its material and cast short, and the deeper the analysis, the clearer the evidence; World War Z is basic entertainment with a gargantuan budget, which is rumored to be over $500 million with advertising expenses.The story revolves around former UN employee Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), his wife Karin (Mireille Enos), and their two daughters as they try to survive a zombie outbreak that occurs right when they are sitting in New York traffic. When all hell immediately breaks loose, they hide out in a small apartment, where Gerry learns he must go assist Dr. Andrew Fassbach (Elyes Gabel), a virologist looking to find the source of the outbreak. Once an origin, production on a vaccination can be mass-produced and quickly-delivered before the entire country is nothing but a wasteland inhabited by the walking dead.The first act of the film assumes traditional action and disaster movie-style, which is to portray a cacophony of catastrophic events occurring all at once in an overpopulated cityscape. At the middle of this chaos is, as stated, Lane's family, who survives numerous instances of peril akin to how John Cusack's family survived numerous close calls in Roland Emmerich's 2012. However, as these close calls aren't what World War Z rests on, thankfully adhering to a more cause-and-effect relationship with the way this outbreak began.This relationship takes up about the last hour of the film, and as a result, drags a bit because character-investment has been traded for meticulous and plodding plot-development towards the outbreak. With that being said, World War Z makes for efficient summer entertainment, but if one is seeking a zombie picture with a human focus, selective gore, and true vibes of uniqueness, the undiscovered gem The Battery lies on all video-on-demand services waiting to be viewed.Starring: Brad Pitt, Mireielle Enos, and Elyes Gabel. Directed by: Marc Forster.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

You've gotta be kidding me.Don't listen to these critics who are not to be taken seriously. Just don't.What's happening in World War Z:Brad Pitt is sitting with his family inside his car in a traffic jam in Philadelphia. A cop on a motorbike stops at his car and warns him, to stay inside the car, only to be run over in the next second by a truck from behind driven by a person who seems to have lost his mind. The following scenes are hard to describe:Thousands of people panic and flee from a small horde of attacking zombies. But the number of bitten people who turn into zombies themselves increases exponentially and very quickly since the time between a bite and being an infected zombie is only about 12 seconds.This is one of the best scenes regarding unexpected terror/horror I have ever seen.You see Brad Pitt throwing a grenade into a horde of attacking zombies in a Boeing 747 in the air at an altitude of 30,000 feet at a speed of 580 mp/h. The damaged aeroplane has a hole due to the explosion. It immediately sucks these zombies out into the sky and some of them are sucked into the turbine...... which leads to a plane crash.Hundreds of thousands (!) of zombies are shown in Israel and around Jerusalem.Tens of thousands of zombies climb a 100-foot wall on a pile of zombies and invade the city of Jerusalem. This and the following scenes are perhaps the best scenes ever done in cinema history in terms of non-stop attacking zombie masses.I don't know another movie with such masses of attacking zombies.But I'm not saying the film is perfect. In the panic scenes when the zombies attack, the camera is very shaky. And very short scenes are cut together. I understand that this is a way to convey panic and the flight reflex, but the director sometimes overdoes it. For some mysterious reason, many filmmakers do it so in similar films.Nevertheless, one of my top 3 movies about a zombie apocalypse.My rating is 8.5/10.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

The greatest zombie story ever written coming to the big screen? The sheer scale of it, Max Brook's globe trotting masterpiece, written in the best traditions of the genre, equal parts good old fashioned gore fest and social commentary of it's age.Then there were the set pieces, Yonkers, Hope, the great battles never before envisaged in a zombie movie, and I read with glee, this movie was going to have the budget to meet expectations.Then it was announced Brad was going to star, that was the first warning sign. Could such an A-List star take the back seat? The book had no central protagonist... OK maybe they would keep the overall theme but give Gerry Lane a role in a few of the chapters as well as the interviewer role. Then came rumours of delays, in fighting and walk outs.By the time the movie was released the press was so bad I could almost not bring myself to watch it. But I had too, I had to see it. So I went to the theater to find... NONE of it, he took nothing other than the name of the movie and a couple of the characters? Why? Why Brad? Why? Why did you buy up the rights to this, preventing others from using the source material to produce this generic focus-group scripted garbage? If you liked it so little that you changed everything about it, why buy the rights? Rumour had it that Di Caprio had been outbid on the rights.I don't know if our merry strolling friend Leo would have done a better job - but he couldn't have done worse.Also - that ending?

A rabies-like pathogen is rapidly spreading and zombifying folks over the greater girth of the globe. For viewers who dote on CGI, there are scenes where scads of the afflicted swarm at lightning speed. For those in the audience who prefer killer suspense, there is a slow, scary struggle through the halls of a zombie-infested laboratory. One scene--the flick's creepiest--has Brad Pitt and one of the litchy-looking creatures separated by a mere glass partition. As the two silently size each other up, the monster grotesquely glares and gnashes his teeth. Despite all the snapping and snarling, however, the film has a dearth of blood and gore--which probably disappoints many fans of the zombie genre. The movie seems much more concerned with political messages and, sadly, not the sort traditionally seen in science fiction. There is no hint that the dread disease is related to the recklessness or poor choices of mankind, no clue that science has somehow gone mad and birthed a world- destroying monstrosity. The message of this movie is non-subtle and non-stop, and it's the same one that infects almost all modern, English- language cinema. And this offering is so full of it that a viewer might find himself counting incidents of political correctness rather than attacks by the creatures. The film's creators couldn't change the fact that ticket-selling Brad Pitt is a white male, so they made him a pancake-cooking Mr. Mom in an otherwise female household. His neighbors are a Hispanic couple who don't speak English, his old boss an African, his new helpmate a macho Israeli woman. When the latter's countrymen erect a wall to forestall the zombies, they just climb over it. (Of course, like the Mexican border, it's unguarded!) And, naturally, Pitt's humanity-saving mission doesn't land at world-class Ben Gurion Airport, but at Arafat Airport--which is, in reality, a bombed-out, non- functioning ruin. Fortunately, this film has just enough action and suspense to avoid the same fate.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Examples are Mr. and Mrs. Smith, a strike out to end the game while Fight Club is a grand slam. Then he did a movie like Troy which is more like an intentional walk. He was boring and almost unnecessary but still useful. With World War Z out I gave it a fighting chance it's easily an RBI double. You know I should have said Moneyball with all with all the baseball references but I haven't seen it but I assume he did well. World War Z is a zombie movie loosely based on the book and with all the zombie stuff that came out in the past few years with The Walking Dead and all the videogames about zombies I feared this movie would be too little too late. I had high hopes for this movie and I was not disappointed. The movie starts with a bit of a far-fetched action sequence but it kicked off the movie in strong fashion. We saw a little bit of his normal family life and everything seemed really good. We get a hint at an old job Pitt had but he left to be with his family. I personally liked his family. I was afraid once he left them they would not really be seen again but every now and then the audience is reminded of their existence and that is important. His family is why he fights and it is his drive for everything he does in the movie. With the way the movie kicked off I was a bit worried. In terms of action it was awesome and set a great pace but in terms of story it lacked, badly. The zombie outbreak just happened. No idea how or why. It was sudden and it came out of nowhere. One second the family is in traffic and the next there is an explosion and a huge truck plowing away traffic like snow. I was sitting in my theater giving myself a reality check seeing as that truck would never get thru those cars so easily but I let it go. The movie then took a turn and dug deep into the story. It turns out Pitt used to work for the UN and he is set out on a quest to find the origin of the virus and the leverage to actually do it is his family. I also loved the little Spanish kid they take in while they are in Newark, kid is a beast.Brad Pitt gives another stellar performance and so did the actress who played the little girl in The Dark Knight Rises, it's the little girl with the shaved head we all thought was a bay, yeah her, she was a good fit. In terms of acting Brad Pitt was the only one that mattered. By that I mean nobody else got enough screen time to get connected to. Anthony Hopkins plays a criminal in a South Korean prison and his character was awesome. The conversation between him and Pitt was my favorite scene is the entire movie. I wish it was possible to see more of his character and many others but to push the story along they had their fifteen minutes of fame, literally, and moved on. In terms of suspense this movie was grade A. The scene where the zombies are climbing up the wall by using a giant pig pile was brilliant. That whole scene was a giant mound of awesomeness I didn't want to end. The zombies themselves looked amazing and real. When I say real I mean if zombies were a real thing they would look like these zombies. The way they run in packs and swarm cities is terrifying and awesome to watch. The transformation from normal person to a hungry zombie was creepy and hard to watch. The action scenes were great, especially the scene on the plane. I saw it in the trailers and I was afraid it would be awful but it was awesome. Other than explosive and physical action there was a sense of suspense in sneaking around. Pitt finds himself in a hospital because he thinks has found a way to become immune to the virus. He and two other people are sneaking around and its gets intense. The crawling and sneaking is like something from a video game and it was fun to watch. It wasn't a short thing either, it took a long time for the scene to finish and it was highly entertaining. Overall, I thought World War Z was going to be a disgrace of a film but I walked out enjoying it very much. I heard this was the beginning of a trilogy which I am now OK with. With the way it ended I left with a feeling of wanting more. Brad Pitt did way better than I thought he would have and when it comes out on blu ray I will buy it. For now, World War Z gets the WillyT Honorable mention. It is a very good movie for the summer and is one that you should go see and enjoy as much as I did.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

This is what ""World War Z"" does, and it deserves more appreciation for that. Instead, critics moan that it was like ""28 Days Later"" with more budget, missing the obvious difference between those movies even though the titles say it all. For once, here is a zombie movie which gives an idea of the world wide consequences of the disease and which does not play in a post-apocalyptic setting but shows the outbreak right from the beginning. I also could not care less whether the movie was true to the novel. Nor did I miss gore. There is plenty of gory schlock out there, watch that if you need gore so much. What I didn't like though was the science. This movie had the potential to give you the feeling that this could actually happen, but the science was just too awkward for that. Still, I found the movie very entertaining, and it has a couple of very memorable scenes.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Not this movie. Humanity is totally screwed when giant walls of zombies come at you at breakneck speeds bringing down helicopters and knocking over buses, not even guns able to slow them down. As you can tell by the trailer it is up to Brad Pitt's character to try and find a way to stop the zombies. This guy seemed to have the worst luck in the world, or maybe it was the best? In any case I'm voting to have Brad Pitt to be the new Chuck Norris due to the amount of balls this dude had in this movie. This movie was amazing and definitely a step up from all the other zombie movies I have seen, and I have seen quite a few. And if you want a good movie to take your girlfriend to this is it, she will be clinging to you the entire time.","9 out of 18 found this helpful.

It was a good one time watch although barely escaped marginalizing the zombie genre with a good dose of de ja vu moments. And it fared better because of some superbly contemplated shots and action sequences with masterly special effects. It can appeal to a wider audience because of abated violence and intense visuals.Brad Pitt monopolized screen time for obvious reasons and practically stole credit for nearly every major turn of events; I sympathize with the director for having to balance the star's ego and contribution of the other cast members.At the risk of drawing parallels with previous productions having similar themes, which to be honest is inevitable, I would place the 28 days/weeks duo far ahead of WWZ. Without the star power the two movies were able to create the sense of true despair and a very eerie and uneasy sense of reality that pushes you into an adrenaline high enough to kick start your survival instincts while keeping the thrills in tact.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

As such, 'World War Z (2013)' tries it's best to stand-out but inadvertently blends in with those aforementioned titles. It's getting to a point now where you either have to be really creative but in the process make a piece that isn't really a 'zombie' flick, or just go back to the old Romero way of doing things in order to make something seen as 'original' - although the latter hasn't really happened yet in a big way. This particular picture also falls into the pitfall of having eyes too big for its budget, as its shaky special effects often soften the impact of some of the more grandiose - and frankly silly - fast-running walking-dead set-pieces which usually lean on the crowd-clambering conceit the picture tends to use almost like a crutch. It's telling, though, that the successful third-act is a much slower one that values suspense over splendour and that the more ostentatious moments pierce the overly serious tone to provide the most enjoyable memories. 7/10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The zombies in the Walking Dead T.V show movie slow and in this movie they can run which is a refreshing change for zombies.

Not the best idea to watch ""Braindead"" and then ""World War Z"" the same day. That will say, first the BEST zombie movie ever, then a... not so great one. Unfortunately, the movie is rated PG-13, which means that the violence is extremely toned down (you'd in fact be surprised at how little you can get away with), but ironically, that's still not the biggest issue. I thought at first that it was still KINDA bloody for being PG-13, not ""Woah"" exactly, but sort of ""Huh, I didn't know they could do that"". I realized suddenly I was watching the unrated version. WHAT?? Lame! Is MPAA sensitive or are they sensitive? Anyway, thought I might count down why this movie didn't quite fit in with my tastes: 1. I thought it would be a quirky little dark comedy considering the book it was based on. Guess I was wrong. I didn't even smile except at the scene where the zombies root for the Pepsi-cans, but that was UNINTENTIONAL comedy. 2. The characters are surprisingly forgettable. Sure, in some zombie-movies there may be stereotypes, but they are often likable enough that you can look past that. In this movie, everyone except for maybe Gerry Lane had little to NO personality. 3. The score is unoriginal and not notable. Not the biggest grip I have though, some movies are excellent even with very forgettable music. 4. Brad Pitt is normally excellent, but for some reason, I felt that he didn't use his capabilities to the fullest here. Watch Fight Club and then this movie. You will notice a HUGE difference in acting-enthusiasm. Most of the time he just stares into the air blankly. 4. Zombie-movies are often full of witty and funny dialogue. Here? Nope. 5. The make-up is terrible. It's hard to believe these are actually zombies. 6. The first half in general didn't seem to have much going for it. The second half was better, though not by a long mile. 7. The ending. There are ALL reasons to hate it.So in short, it's not a complete waste of time, but also not a complete spend of time. Wait, what the hell? That phrase didn't make any sense. Watch ""Shaun Of The Dead"", ""28 Days Later"" and ""Braindead"" instead. Those are REAL zombie movies. Heck, even ""Warm Bodies"" is a zombie-movie, just of a different kind!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

For what seemed like years (it was), I remember reading in the ""Trades"" about all the problems this movie had getting off the ground. I was getting a little worried as I read more and more about the issues as time went on.I like the Zombie genre and from the short clips of World War Z I was able to see before it was released, I thought this was going to be big. Like $100 million opening weekend big. Heh, yeah, I know right.I never got a chance to see the movie until just a few months ago. Was it worth the wait? Well, yes and no. Brad Pitt fans, and Zombie fans will love it, but not without some brickbats and caveats. I am a big fan of the latter, and a so-so fan of the former. I read the book before I saw the movie, and I understood the difference between the two and that is what made it even more interesting to me. Plus, I really enjoyed the book and after reading it I felt I had a good comprehension of the characters and I was prepared to see them in action now, which in the movie takes place before the book.I wasn't disappointed when I finally saw World War Z. Yeah, it could have been better (I gave it a 7...any movie that keeps my interest for at least 95% of the time gets a 7...that seems to be the median that I follow here at IMDb). But it was disappointingly sort of anti-climactic. I was expecting more, and I thought there would be more to it. After, I just sort of sat there on my cardboard box wondering, ""is that it? Did I just miss something?""It sure felt that way. It's kind of like the feeling you got when you were a kid and you wanted a dog for Christmas but got a cat instead. Or the day you went to see Star Wars but you had to sit at the back row because you were late getting to the theater. You still sort of got what you wanted, but not what you expected. But, I have seen World War Z three times already so it's not that bad. Be warned though, that could just be my OCD, just my OCD, my OCD.I have seen it three times already, but another thing that bothers me is the Zombies, which, for a movie that is mostly about Zombies, is a little bit of an issue. I completely disagree with the whole running Zombie thing – or at times sprinting! George A. Romero would be just as saddened to hear of these super-fast new Zombies that can climb walls higher than what Trump plans on building to keep the Mexicans out, and run faster than most living humans. Not to mention this super strength they have? WTF? Where did that come from? But then again, the world is moving a lot faster than it did in 1968's ""Night of the Living Dead"".I did like to see the live transformation from living human, to undead Zombie happen before my eyes. Whether that is physically possible, or not, it's still kinda cool. The CGI is awesome for those scenes, as it is for the rest of the film (well, that damn movie cost $190,000,000 to make so it better have great CGI).I wouldn't have paid whatever it costs now to go to a movie on a weekend, but perhaps middle-of-Wednesday-afternoon-prices instead. In my case, I got it free from the library 4 years after release date (yes, they still do exist and now with fancy new automated check in and check outsoon, no more librarians!).Well, now I wait yet again to get my fill of Zombie flesh. There's always the very good and reliable ""The Walking Dead"" to fill the void until anther apocalyptic Zombie movie comes about. Perhaps the new string of Zombies that will soon be released upon civilization will be exactly like those in World War Z. It may have foretold our fate. We can look at World War Z as a training film.You'll soon look back on this day when ""The Idiot Savant"" was right, yet again. Meanwhile, I'll be holed up in the nearest prison (voluntarily this time) with my own minions of loyal followers protecting what's left of this world from the super-fast-super- strong World War Z Zombies.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Lots of gore. In what seems like a statement of dramatic intent from director Marc Forster, WWZ has very little blood and guts, instead focussing on building tension and presenting a rational view on what it might be like if there ever was a zombie-apocalypse. It's a shame, because there's no reason Forster couldn't have his cake and explode heads all over it too. In an attempt to ground proceedings and maintain a realistically sombre mood, this undead-pandemic yarn is also unrelentingly grim and overly serious, sorely lacking in both humour and action sequences designed to thrill (rather than chill). On a better note, the screenplay, based loosely on Max Brooks' acclaimed novel, emerges as ruthlessly pragmatic - despite having had at least five people work on the script at various stages - and gratefully sets the story in parts of the world rarely seen on the big screen. The hordes of CGI zombies are intriguingly conceived and the cinematography by Ben Seresin is unquestionably the film's greatest asset, whilst Brad Pitt is typically solid and charismatic as the ex-UN investigator who gives the audience a man to cheer for. Disappointingly, WWZ is not the film it should've been, but if you're looking for a gritty, Contagion-esque drama that gets under your skin then it largely succeeds.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

All this negativity toward this movie seems to stem from many users' notion that THEY know what a zombie movie ""should be"" and this movie isn't ""it"" How do you enjoy ANY movie with such strong preconceived notions of what the movie will be?Complaining about flesh not falling from Zeeks faces? Well, they're not supernatural; they're infected! Mad they jerk and twist and moan rather scream scarily? Well, jerking the head in random patterns seems a logical motion detecting mechanism for a virus. And screaming scarily would startle would-be prey. Mad they chomp their teeth in neutral? The virus spreads by biting...What I'm getting at is I loved what most zombie nerds apparently disliked about Z's Zeeks. They were realistic, natural, designed by nature, functional, NOT MAGIC! They were built for a purpose, SPREAD, and they are designed well for it.Great film, the action is intense and engrossing. All this without gratuitous gore, cursing, or sex? What's not too like (other than the Zeeks aren't ""zombies"" identical to other portrayals?)Go see it for an intense SciFi thriller starring Brad Pitt.

Now, I have seen some terrible book to movie adaptations. In some cases it was because the scope of the book just couldn't translate to film. For most others, it was because the producers wanted to do their own thing and didn't care about honoring the story they were deriving their movie from. This is the second case, only a thousand times worse. The movie has so little to do with the book there is literally ZERO justification in using the same title or Paramount owning the rights. And then even besides that, the story they pulled out of their asses is terrible on its own! I could tell the movie was going to diverge from the book from the trailers, but I didn't expect it to be so offensively full of plot holes and unjustified character choices. All of the action, conflict, and tension was derived from idiotic mistakes on the parts of the humans rather than peril from the zombies. The resolution was not only ridiculous and silly conceptually, but also totally unnecessary. You know what is guaranteed to ruin an apocalypse movie? A RESOLUTION. Granted, even without that, there was really no saving this film. The action sequences are sudden and unjustified, the CGI looks like it's from a 2003 video game, and the ""zombie"" concept was trying so hard to be original that it ended up being a total joke. Seriously. They are basically dolphin/chipmunk zombies. It would have been laughable if it hadn't been so annoying.","27 out of 61 found this helpful.

Work on the film began around 2006 and from then on, the production was troubled. Brad Pitt became involved early on, putting up much of his own money for it – with his production company Plan B – yet even he must have been worried when he saw how difficult the making of the film was becoming. Directors were changed and the script passed through the hands of about five scriptwriters. The budget started out somewhere around $120 – 130 million, but it continued to rise and is now reported to be over $200 million. Rumours abounded reporting tensions between Pitt and director Marc Forster. Then, the original ending was entirely scraped, so reshoots were required to somehow be weaved into the existing narrative. After all this trouble, I went into 'World War Z' expecting a mess with cracks evident on screen. However, in a pleasant surprise, it flows nicely with the new ending working seamlessly.This film is many things, but it isn't really an adaptation of Max Brooks' 2003 novel of the same name, even though it started out as such. Brooks' acclaimed novel has a multi-narrative structure that would better lend itself to a TV show as opposed to a film. Whereas the book concerns multiple narrators, the movie solely follows ex-UN official Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) who experiences a zombie outbreak first-hand, narrowly escaping the chaos with his family. However, his former boss asks him to travel the world to search for a possible cure for the pandemic.Most zombie movies and TV shows (good or bad) take place after the initial outbreak, whether it be 'The Walking Dead', or Danny Boyle's brilliant '28 Days Later'. In a refreshing turn, 'World War Z' depicts the outbreak the minute it happens, and these scenes are some of the best in the film, conveying a frenzied feeling of panic. It feels what it would really be like - cars crash, people scramble in every direction, disaster everywhere. Secondly, the majority of zombie films and shows find their characters confined to a small area; for example, the shopping centre 'Dawn of the Dead'. One of the best aspects of 'World War Z' is that it shows the zombie pandemic on a global scale, with the central character travelling from the U.S. to Korea to Israel to Wales. This globe-trotting element provides the film with some thrilling setpieces, in particular the relentless scenes where thousand- strong swarms of zombies flood through the streets of Jerusalem or the initial panic in Philadelphia.Marc Forster is a director with a mixed back record – 'Stranger than Fiction' may have been great, but he followed it up with the huge disappointment that was 'Quantum of Solace' – thankfully, 'World War Z' is significantly better than the latter. It's no masterpiece, but it's a quite good and consistently enjoyable romp. Pitt delivers a solid performance and makes Lane an engaging protagonist. The lack of gore and the presence of fast zombies may annoy fans of the book and zombie traditionalists, but I found that both worked (especially the latter) in the context of the movie. It's not the book, but 'World War Z' is still a good film, especially after all the trouble it went through.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

These are the facts: It's an apocalyptic zombie thriller, so what do you expect? It's a perfect film on the things it proposes. It's the best apocalyptic film I've seen to this day.It has a very good pacing, with a very fast and explosive beginning that gives hints on what's on the way. Different from some apocalyptic films, this does not ease the pace at almost any moment, keeping your eyes glued to the screen. The characters are not the deepest on the world, but they're built just fine.What I really enjoyed about this film, is that it explored lots of interesting and relevant issues on a zombie Armageddon that are usually left out: how did it begin, where did it begin, how it works, and what's the cure, without, at any moment, dropping the thrilling pace. And it actually showed humanity fighting the zombies... This was something that always bothered me on zombie films, and I'm a big fan of the genre... Why the hell does not everyone gather up and fight'em with everything possible? And I also liked it that the cure is actually very plausible.There were some interesting geopolitics references that gave me chills... I'm not going to give them up, but they made me think ""Wow, that makes a lot of sense!"" And as if it was not enough, there's a great soundtrack, with an incredible theme song by Muse. There was also one of the best uses of 3D that I've ever seen. The scene on the vault on South Korea, with the flying dust around the dead bodies is very beautiful... Honestly one of the few times I've seen a justified use of 3D on a film.As for other important aspects, the acting is fine; the fast action scenes are well filmed, succeeding to pass the whole chaotic situation to the viewer without making him confused. The photography is very cold, exactly what I expected from this kind of film.Well, to sum up: This is a perfect zombie film, in every aspect. But remember, it's just a zombie film, so don't expect anything rather than that.","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

That said I found World War Z a really good film. I eagerly anticipated the release of this film and I wasn't disappointed. Those who slated this film really need to watch it again. The story line was good, if a little far fetched at times (but we are talking about a pandemic Zombie virus here) and the action sequences were well paced with the...well...not so action scenes...also there was some humour which was needed. The film gave the viewer the chance to figure things out for themselves rather than giving hugely over explained scenes that would've slowed the pace which I feel was one of its stronger points.So to all those reviewers who went to the premier or got tickets to see it at a film festival remember the film is there to entertain the masses and not just you so don't analyse the relationship between director and star or talk about how we've seen it all before in 28 days later......BECAUSE 28 DAYS LATER IS NOT A ZOMBIE FILM, THEY WERE INFECTED WITH RAGE.......ahem.....I digress .....my point is that this is a good action film and definitely one to see.

The climactic scenes at a besieged WHO facility in Wales are more firmly rooted in the George Romero or 28 DAYS tradition of zombie flicks, with Brad Pitt trying to avoid a smaller group of the Undead on a claustrophobic set. The ending does not seem to rule out the possibility of a sequel - WORLD WAR TWO? - if Brad wants to go 'slumming' again (Tom Cruise does it all the time).Pitt acquits himself well in his role, much as Dustin Hoffman did in the 1995 pandemic movie OUTBREAK but we would rather see our leading actors in roles where they're playing against something a bit more challenging than rampaging CGI monsters, wouldn't we? A lot of money was clearly spent making WORLD WAR Z and it shows, but this really is - how shall I put it? - a load of tosh. Hugely enjoyably tosh, though, and I look forward to sitting through a sequel or two.

They've done them 'scary'. They've done them funny. They've even done them as mysteries, romances, and even *shudder* musicals. So the best I can figure is, as with gross-out comedies, producers keep making them for teens and brainless people (yes, I got taken in, too) to waste money on.Case in point, World War Z. Plus: Brad Pitt is in it. Minus: Script, Acting, Plot, DirectingMy excuse? I took a chance because Brad Pitt makes interesting movie choices -- mostly. Wrong decision by both of us, in this case. Frankly, I find it very difficult to justify wasting even more time to go deeper. Suffice it to say that if you enjoy watching flashbacks of survivors (a la Blair Witch jigglecamery) telling you how scary it all was, or if you enjoy seeing Saganistic ""billions and billions"" of fractalized zombies crawling around -- this tripe is for you.

First, yet *another* zombie movie and second the CGI looked very shoddy. Plus I had heard that the movie had been plagued by production issues, numerous rewrites and whatnot.Fast forward to a couple weeks ago and for some reason I became interested in seeing it. I think I remember reading an article saying early reviews were positive. Shows how easily I'm swayed. Or it could just be that I love movies and I'll watch anything (can't say I'll always pay for them though)The positive scores on rotten tomatoes sealed it for me so I went today after work.I was just about getting over the headache that Man of Steel gave me so I wasn't looking forward to the 3D. Surprisingly, the 3D was well done. Zack Snyder needs to get in touch with Marc Forster for some tips on properly post converting.Aside from the 3D, there was nothing revolutionary to add to the zombie genre except maybe showing that a zombie movie can be done without copious amounts of blood and gore and still be quite entertaining. The CGI wasn't an issue like I thought it might be.Am I the only person who thinks Brad Pitt is a bad actor? He's not Channing Tatum level but he can't hold a candle to say DiCaprio in my opinion.WWZ is a decent 2 hours at the cinema. I'm not sure I need to see it again when it's on blu-ray/TV, too many other movies to see.","3 out of 17 found this helpful.

It's tense, it's exciting and a little unnerving due to the fact that this film depicts very well how things would play out if a virus was to break out in densely populated cities.I don't know who to thank but I was pleasantly surprised that when using cities around the world for various plot points they didn't go with London in the UK but for Cardiff in Wales in the UK :o) made a nice change as I come from Wales.In essence, the pros outweighed the cons,and yes there were cons(not so fluid plot, no foreplay,plus this movie could of been at least an extra hour longer).Final statement - I'm a massive zombie movie fan and I was not insulted by the movie, to be honest it nice to have a bit of variation.

It's a fast-moving, intricate, and solidly acted by the indomitable Brad Pitt.Okay, sure, the ""Z"" stands for zombies (in the book and in the film), but let's be frank (or Bob or Justine) - these aren't zombies, really. Well, they're sort of a cross between a zombie and the victims of the Rage virus from 28 Days Later. The bitten turn into homicidal maniacs about ten seconds after infection has set in. But they're attracted to noise and to life itself, so essentially if you both have a terminal disease and are really quiet, they won't see you. These infected are sort of like the T. Rex of the human populace.Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former UN employee with some knowledge about infectious disease. He's driving his kids to school and his wife (Mirielle Enos) to work in Philadelphia when it happens - sudden stop of traffic followed by cars crashing, police scrambling, and finally, a horde of contaminated peoples running amok over the city, coming after those who still live. This sets off the expected chain of events of Gerry and his family ushered out of Newark, NJ to a ship in the North Atlantic, from where the UN is running its operation of Find the Cause. The UN, in the person of Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena), pulls Gerry into the scrum: they feel he's their man; he's the one who can find out not only where the infection began but how to stop it.Gerry's adventures take him to such incongruous places as South Korea, Israel, and Wales at a frenetic pace. Some scenes are eerily reminiscent of John Carpenter's The Thing; in one, Gerry and a military escort must silently pedal bikes to a plane for refueling, so as not to alert the walking dead and thus turn them into running dead. It's a creepy, chilling scene, and never has riding a bike looked so difficult.Now, if you've read the book by Max Brooks and plan to see this movie, you should know that the overall structure of Brooks' book (narration by Lane) is jettisoned for a more straightforward action-movie approach. And you might well be put off by that at first, but once you get over your faux outrage, you may discover that the movie is actually the better for the change; the result is much more suspenseful and riveting on the big screen than a true adaptation might have been.I like Brad Pitt, and this makes up for Killing Them Softly in spades. He's his usual terrific self as Gerry, who isn't some hardscrabble, world-weary action guy but rather an authentic everyman who could be any of us, only with better hair. His Lane is shown to be quite vulnerable (physically and psychologically), and Pitt's able to pull it off magnificently - unlike, say, a Tom Cruise or a Leonardo DiCaprio (the latter made a heavy bid for the rights to Brooks' tome). This is part of what makes Pitt such a fine actor. He's malleable; he can play bad guy, good guy, action hero, clever bastard, and so on without looking out of his element. He is the driving force of this film.As I mentioned, the movie moves (shambles?) at a quick pace. Ordinarily, this might mean that there's little plot involved, but if anything the movie is overplotted. Thankfully, time isn't wasted trying to explain to us every little detail about how Lane arrives at certain conclusions or on secondary or tertiary characters and their reasons for being where they are. It's a succinct plot that makes the best use of its runtime.World War Z, although perhaps not a true zombie film (are the victims killed and then turn or are are they infected and then turn?), is a perfectly good adrenaline-rush movie with a punchy, intelligent script and a typical knockout performance by Pitt.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

As Norwegian ""Dead Snow"" (2009), who was the first with Nazi zombies. Danny Boyle, best known for ""Trainspotting"" (1996) and Oscar winner ""Slumdog Millionaire"" (2008), was in ""28 Days Later"" first with zombies that are not dragging themselves through life, but was fast as hell. A real shock for all zombie fans the first time the film was shown.""World War Z"" has zombies running so fast that Usain Bolt would be eliminated already in the trial heats. Furthermore, they are many. Too many. It appears a little too obvious that it is computer animated zombies climbing on each other like ants up the walls and barricades. The film was preceded by disaster rumors, including after an informed article in Vanity Fair. It was about a budget that is constantly rising. About a discord between the film's director Marc Forster and star/producer Brad Pitt. About an super expensive final third set in Russia and that has been completely discarded in favor of a totally different ending. It required several well-paid screenwriter to find. And so on.Many great films suffer similar rumors. They are not always true. And ""World War Z"" is by no means a disaster. Initially and finally, really good. In the portrayal of the chaos that occurs in the middle of an American city when the zombie epidemic breaks out. And the bare tension that arises when Brad Pitt's UN inspector Gerry Lane in a sophisticated way try to fool a small number of zombies who have barricaded themselves in a research institute where a possible cure for the epidemic can be. It creates scenes that sends shivers through intimacy and silence. Otherwise, you can hardly blame ""World War Z"" to be a small film. When Brad Pitt's UN inspector travels around the world, it's thousands of zombies just everywhere, as if the whole world had been infected in a few hours. A bit silly. Besides Pitt, it is also just one person in general who makes a impression, a tough female soldier (Daniella Kertesz).Eventually, ""World War Z"" is becoming as any other zombie film, only more lavish.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

In the old American tradition of racist propaganda the zombies (yes zombies) behave like colonial insects reminding me of all the times I heard Americans compare the Chinese to ants. The countless zombies move like lightning to over top the wall where they spill down on the smiling happy Israelis below. Previously the Koreans were treated as zombies and murdered without pause or hesitation.One could argue that the Americans were suffering the same difficulty and that the epidemic depicted was on a world wide scale and that is, perhaps, a mitigating factor in the guilt of whoever devised this malodorous bit of slop.One suspects that had the Palestinians, crawling like souped up ants, been black and the smiling happy citizens on the other side of the wall white the movie would have had little or no audience. As it is I think you are ill advised to support this sort of movie making with your dollars.In general the film is just one long desperate chase, of a sort that I find tedious, but which I understand some people enjoy, so if you like a chase and you don't mind the portrait of the subhuman non Americans you might find it pleasant.

Nobody knows exactly how this got started, but the results are devastating. A live person bitten by one of these things typically ""turns"" within a dozen seconds, although sometimes the process takes longer. After getting his family to supposed safety, Gerry goes globe trotting in search of answers and solutions.This loose, mega-budget adaptation of the novel by Max Brooks (son of comedy legend Mel Brooks!) doesn't lack for sheer spectacle. The filmmakers, led by director Marc Forster, try very hard to make sure you're not bored, with one over-the-top action set piece after another. They counteract these unintentionally amusing scenes with more human moments, as well as some suspense (such as the finale with Gerry avoiding the living dead while obtaining a possible solution in a World Health Organization building).You'll likely never see another movie with a higher count of zombie antagonists. They attack the living with true ferociousness, and in enormous numbers. Unfortunately, due to the expected plethora of CGI, a lot of these scenes often end up pretty funny to behold, rather than simply exciting. The story has its share of ridiculousness, with Gerry proving to have almost as many lives as a cat.The well-chosen international cast (Mireille Enos, Daniella Kertesz, James Badge Dale, Ludi Boeken, Fana Mokoena, Elyes Gabel, Peter Capaldi, Ruth Negga, etc.) provides excellent support, lending this material all the gravitas that they can muster. There's an especially vivid cameo for David Morse as an ex-CIA agent who's gone more than a little loopy. The character of Gerry is not fleshed out to any great degree, but Pitt makes for a decent hero nevertheless.Overall, the movie is watchable, without achieving its full potential. By this point in time, it does feel like stuff we've all seen before. Certainly it has some intriguing elements, and Forster & company waste little time getting started, creating intense moments of disaster within the first 10 minutes.Six out of 10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

There is one major and two minor problems with WWZ. First, the first 25 minutes of the film is almost unwatchable because the editors kept switching the camera angles every one or two seconds during the action sequences. It makes your head spin trying to follow the action. That's the major problem. Second, the zombies move too fast. They move so fast you can't really get a good look at any of them. I'm used to the slow-moving ones that you see on The Walking Dead. That to me seems more realistic. Third, there's a little too much CGI. It's not as overused like in The Hobbit or 2012, but those action scenes in Israel definitely did not feel real. Overall, this film was disappointing. It's something worth paying a couple dollars for to rent, but buying the DVD or the Blu-ray would be a waste of money.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Like most films with a literary origin, ""World War Z"" fails to live up to the joys of the book, not making it through the transition from page to screen. But if you take it on it's own terms and forget the source, this is a perfectly decent summer blockbuster action adventure movie.The seven-star rating I gave is treating this as it's own thing, with no connection to the amazing fictional oral history of the Zombie Wars by Max Brooks. WWZ-Movie has effective thrills, decent choices by the characters (for the most part; I'll get into the picky things that pulled me out of the experience later), and images that stuck with me days after I walked out of the theater. A parent and spouse making sacrifices for his family, putting himself into danger to give his loved ones a better chance at life is a theme that speaks to me. The flood of rage-filled infected pouring over a wall like a tsunami with all of their humanity drained away, the face of an ally suddenly turned into an unthinking, unreasoning deadly threat... these are compelling, and worth the price of admission.Acting is solid, and didn't distract me from the narrative. Brad Pitt is reliably pretty, and he played this role with subdued confidence. Special effects ranged from spectacular and jarring (think of the trash truck turned into careening death) to the subtle and unnerving (a charred corpse with a finger still twitching, searching for a new victim.) Practical effects were first-rate, while digital effects have since been eclipsed by modern games. But if you squint a little you can stay in the story.What yanked me out of the experience were a few errors that had me saying, ""wait, what?"" out loud in the theater.About a half hour into the movie, the protagonist boards a Russian-made AN-12 Cub taking off from a US aircraft carrier. Wait, what? That should be a C-2 Greyhound. A transport that big just isn't used like that (there was an experiment back in the '60s, but it was just that, an experiment.) Okay, I told myself, engage artificial suspension of disbelief. And this is a UN project, so maybe they got air transport support from an eastern European air force. Then we see the Cub banking... and it's in US military paint. This zombie apocalypse is already an alternate universe so why not one where the USAF or US Navy bought some Cubs? Weirder things have happened. Moments later we see a different angle of the plane in flight, and now it's a real C-130. Come on, filmmakers! The two planes may have the same role and similar performance, but they really don't look all that alike. It's a small thing, but it knocked me right out of the movie.WWZ-Movie had several little errors like that, like the water system of the carrier getting diesel contamination, or the magical trash truck forming out of the traffic jam when just five seconds ago we saw there was nothing but parked cars for blocks.Another problem I had was the writing. For the most part, it was... fine. But Hollywood sometimes is a little too slavish in following Joseph Campbell's ""Hero With a Thousand Faces,"" and the Hero's Journey that all adventure films MUST follow. Just after being rescued from a horrific rooftop zombie swarm, Pitt's character is asked to make a dangerous journey, what sounds like a Call to Adventure, one that he's uniquely suited to accomplish. So, what's he do? He turns down this Call. Unsurprisingly, he's told that he must go or they'll kick him along with his family back to Zombie Hell (an obvious and pretty reasonable if harsh conclusion, one that Pitt's character should have known.) Reluctantly, he agrees. Turn, if you will, to the Great Circle of Adventure Storytelling, and you'll see we just ticked off the first two steps, the Call to Adventure, and the Refusal of the Call.Sure Campbell's work does a good job of describing the near universal adventure story. But such strict adherence to The Rules is sometimes annoyingly transparent. It's like the suits at the studio need to justify their obscene salaries by demonstrating they've read Campbell.This isn't great filmmaking. And it sure as hell isn't the book. But it's good enough for a few hours of entertainment. Just pretend that the title is ""Brad Pitt Fights Zombies,"" and then go read the completely separate and unrelated work by Max Brooks, the spectacular fictional oral history titled ""World War Z.""","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It drips information about the zombie apocalypse to the reader through short stories, so that as you read the survivors' accounts you piece together a much bigger story. It would make a brilliant anthology series on HBO. They could hand chapters off to individual filmmakers to adapt into hour-long episodes. Rumour is that there was an earlier script that would have made this film 3+ hours and stuck much closer to the book's structure. The rumour also says that it would have been the first Oscar-worthy zombie film.But that is not what happened. Instead, the filmmakers behind World War Z, including producer Brad Pitt, have looked at the macro-political story that Max Brooks wrote and wrote a Hollywood hero into it. Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former UN agent who is drafted to find a cure. Forced away from his family to globe-trot the apocalypse, he deals with a variety of situations borrowed equally from zombie films and apocalypse disaster movies.Plenty of fans of the novel will be disappointed by this. But the fact that the movie follows a new character while (roughly) following the bigger story of the book means that the characters of the novel are out there. They are facing their own apocalypses. They just didn't cross paths with Brad Pitt. Sequels or (hopefully) an HBO series could give them their time on screen, but for now we have this film starring Brad Pitt.As far as films starring Brad Pitt go, this one is quite good. It didn't try to be funny, which most zombie films do, and the resulting tone was closer to Contagion than Dawn of the Dead. Brad Pitt is a solid leading man as usual. Mireille Enos (The Killing) is his wife, and in her short time on screen she manages to be a competent survivor.Something that often sinks apocalypse films is a transparently manipulative character. The screaming blond in Jaws 2 should have been the first one eaten, but she stubbornly survives to annoy the audience to the end. Fred Astaire's part in The Towering Inferno was specifically designed to break your heart. 2012 was hemorrhaging selfish and annoying characters to hate. These cheap emotional manipulations reveal bad scripts more often than bad actors, so it was nice to see World War Z did not burden its good cast with cheap tricks.Perhaps we will see a WWZ adaptation some day, but for now there is a solid zombie thriller starring Brad Pitt that happens to use the same title.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

This actually raises the stakes and probably makes it more impactful in a real way. The whole set up is very plausible. The stakes for the family are also very real. It also did a good balance of how these situations will bring out the best in most people but also the worst in many. It wasn't all ""everyone is out to take advantage and evil"" but there were some.And sometimes people in the movie didn't react well or did stupid things. But that is realistic if you think about it. Most weren't trained for combat never mind ""the end of the world as they know it"". Stuff happens and they way it was dealt with made it more interesting.Many movies smooth these things over so they are less realistic and therefore make less of an impact. Let's face it, the majority of zombie fair is ridiculous, even when they have a basic premise that is possible. They are like video games that you know aren't real and half the time you are trying not to laugh or get annoyed at the stupidity, just like the average slasher/gore movies. The movie isn't about the zombies, they are just the threat and the backdrop. The movie is about the people. It's kind of like The Walking Dead in that aspect.I'm also not a big fan of movies that have action scenes that just go on forever. It's usually stupid and ultimately boring. More is often not better. This had great action scenes broken up by real human moments. Like I said, a real, well balanced movie.I loved it and it went by very fast. People I was with also weren't too sure going in but loved it coming out of the theater.And you shouldn't never decide a movie based on a book. They never compare well. Unless you want to go the LOTR route and make 3 movies more than 3 hours long, you aren't going to do what was in the book. As a result, even the best adaptations combine characters, merge situations,etc. Judge a movie as a stand alone piece of work.I agree this probably isn't for kids. The stakes are more real and therefore it would be more upsetting. Unfortunately, kids are used to gore these days, but this isn't that.There is at least one minor clip in the trailers that doesn't seem to be in the movie. There will no doubt be an extended version at some point.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

"6","/10","It fails as an apocalyptic film but works as an OK action flick","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2917151/?ref_=tt_urv","matbutcher","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur45790194/?ref_=tt_urv","5 December 2013","I have finally just got round to watching World War Z after all the hyperbole has died down.Now I must make it clear that I read and thoroughly enjoyed the book when it was first published and that I agree with all those other critics' who question the film's faithfulness to its source material and that it is was indeed a real opportunity wasted to make a worthwhile and credible film about global politics and the fragility of human society. Zombies in the Romeronian sense have always acted as a visual metaphor for society's cultural Other, yet this film lacks such depth and therefore I think it is only fair that the film should be considered in isolation, that we forget about its faithfulness to its source material and view the film for what it is –a Hollywood star vehicle and money making visual blockbuster.-If we keep this in mind then the film is not as bad as everyone has made out.There is a lot to be admired in the film. Brad Pitt is steady as always and some of the set pieces including the beginning in Philadelphia and the scene in Jerusalem are visually impressive. The decision to make the zombie's fast rather than lumbering as in Romero's films makes sense and it gives the film a sense of dynamism which is administered effectively in the set pieces. Also I think the lack of gore as some fan boys have complained about does not detract from the overall film and there are a number of jump out of your seat scares, although these do become predictable after a while.Of course there is nothing original about this film, there is nothing being offered here that we haven't seen before and done better. This is a shame, but given the amount of money invested in this film is it any surprise they played it safe? We can also sit and pick apart the plot holes until the cows come home, they are numerous but it still shouldn't detach from the overall film, I mean how many times do we watch the Die Hard films and think ""no, that wouldn't happen!"" This is pure visual popcorn fodder and as such it does a competent, sometimes good but never amazing job.Where the film really falls down is in its lack of overall cohesiveness. It feels like a series of separate spectacular action sequences loosely tied together with poor dialogue. Brad Pitt's love for his family is unconvincing and the story of human survival which should have underpinned the whole story is seriously underplayed. As such the film just doesn't work as a whole and you come away at the end feeling a little cheated, a little unsatisfied. As a huge fan of apocalyptic cinema in general I found the film disappointing because it plays down the human struggle and it really doesn't have a lot to say. Given the promise of its source material this could have been spectacular addition to the genre if it had been placed in the hands of the right director. Nonetheless, zombie films have always tended to be more niche in cinematic terms and have not always fostered mass appeal. This was a huge blockbuster film made especially for mass appeal so it is understandable why certain generic elements take centre stage.In view of this the film works better as an action film that just so happens to be about zombies but really they could have been anything and the film would still feel the same.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I think I hardly relaxed during the entire movie! The zombies were very realistic, which was a major plus. There were a couple of times when I jumped. I've seen a lot of zombie movies, and this was tops all of them without a doubt. It reminded me of it. I'd recommend it for anyone above the age of about 13. Awesome movie!

But with the film released on DVD in an unrated version, curiosity got the better of me, and to my surprise, I really enjoyed what I saw.The script isn't perfect, certain plot developments being hard to adequately explain, and Brad Pitt's character must be the luckiest sonuvabitch alive to survive so many encounters with zombies (and a plane crash!), but disengage the brain and accept the less likely aspects of the story and there is a huge amount of fun to be had with this spectacular, fast-paced horror offering.Lots of brilliantly realised scenes of zombie mayhem, delivering plenty of scares and tension, go to make World War Z a thoroughly thrilling flick from start to finish, with the superb set pieces including a breathtaking race to the top of a tower block, an awesome 'zombie swarm' in Jerusalem, and the discovery of a stowaway zombie on a packed jet in mid-flight. Throw in a few superbly executed jump scares and what you have is a hugely entertaining movie, despite the questionable moments in the narrative.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Lots of zombies. Enough of them, in fact, to literally take over the world.It starts with an unknown patient zero somewhere in Asia. Then there are bizarre reports of Indian soldiers fighting what they call the ""undead."" Gradually cases of a strange disease which re-animates the dead infiltrate major metropolitan areas. Our movie picks up with a sudden outbreak in Philadelphia, and we witness a generally peaceful city transformed in minutes into a sea of chaos, fear, and terror.One of the survivors of the Philadelphia outbreak is Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt). Gerry was once a troubleshooter for the United Nations, and once it becomes obvious that zombies are literally infesting the planet with incredible speed the U.N. wants Gerry back in the field. If he can discover the origins of the disease, then perhaps a cure will follow. Reluctantly, Gerry agrees. He leaves his beloved family behind on an aircraft carrier and flies off to South Korea with a team of Navy SEALs.South Korea proves to be merely the first stop on what will be a globe-spanning odyssey for Gerry, however. As he travels from one international hotspot to another, Gerry slowly pieces together a little information about the zombie threat. But can he come up with a solution before the whole world is ravaged by the undead? To its credit, World War Z tries to be more than your average zombie film. Most films of its type aren't very good, typically being badly written and grotesquely gory. World War Z isn't especially gory, and the shocks it generates are more likely to be generated by suspense and surprise rather than splatter. Pitt is a solid lead, and he clearly delivers his best effort, so that Gerry comes across as a real person rather than a superhero impersonator.Sadly, none of this elevates World War Z above the mundane. For starters, the movie fails to deliver the scale its premise dictates. With the exception of a great scene set in Jerusalem, the movie never captures the magnitude of what is supposedly happening to the entire world. The film keeps us focused almost entirely on what Gerry is experiencing, presumably to establish viewer rapport with our protagonist. But for a movie about a World War, you don't see much of the world or the war.Perhaps more importantly, the film really isn't very scary, and only haphazardly interesting. As mentioned above, there are a few suspenseful moments and it's nice to see a horror movie where something is left to the imagination, but the movie is very slow and has lots of down time where the zombies aren't directly involved in the action. The result is a movie that just sort of rumbles along, hitting a few high points here and there but ultimately failing to reach a suitable climax. Even though World War Z isn't quite two hours long, it feels closer to three.World War Z is one of those films that isn't an outright failure, but it isn't anything special, either. If you really like zombies then go ahead and give it a go—you've most likely seen worse. Otherwise, you should probably just save your money.","7 out of 12 found this helpful.

"","","World War Z has a rushed ending and is choppy as a whole, but thanks to pulse-pounding and wonderfully visceral set pieces succeeds as one hell of a thrill ride.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2949095/?ref_=tt_urv","hasserbond","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur50180847/?ref_=tt_urv","26 January 2014","World War Z has an abrupt ending, and it isn't much of a cohesive film, but rather a string of extremely intense, pulse pounding, and wonderfully visceral set pieces. Definitely see it for some summer bait to chomp on and one hell of a thrill ride. The story: The plot, generally, is supposed to be set on Max Brook's (interestingly son of comic genius Mel Brooks) bestselling mock-non fiction book World War Z. The novel essentially is a retelling of the history of the world after a global outbreak of the zombie infection. It aims at portraying a satirical while realistic display of the brain chomping carnage, and provides all of the juicy political and social commentary any zombie fan could ask for. Now for the movie, they use the term ""based on"" fairly loosely. Cut most of the statistics and commentary, this movie is about action and white knuckle suspense. Newly retired UN worker Gerry (Brad Pitt) has chosen to settle down with his family, who reside in Philly, but his plans of relaxation are far from fruition as his life and world are hit stuck with a disaster. Zombie infections begin to breakout all over the world and here's the worst part; not only do these zombies run, they topple and climb over/up each other like ants. Also, without giving to much away, they can multiply faster than you can tie your shoe. Soon, cities crumble, and millions of the population have been ""lost"" as Gerry and his family are escorted to battleships in the Atlantic for protection. But Gerry is far from safe as he is called upon to help aid research and fight against the plague across the world, and let's just say that things get tasty. The good: The film's action set pieces are genuinely spectacular and create some of the most nail-biting and intense moments of celluloid that I have experienced since Zero Dark Thirty. They are big, bad-ass, and also very in range. While some have big-scale moments of terrifying moments of awe, think back to the ant-like antagonists, others are quieter and build up to an explosive boil of terror and excitement. The great pacing also truly helps create the fluid nerve- racking energy that is so present during these scenes. Pitt is also good as the lead and is subtlety charismatic and like-able as our reluctant survivor. The rest of the cast is strong and do a perfectly serviceable job. The special effects are solid and create many frightening and spooky visuals of carnage throughout the film. The bad: The film has been notable for being a partial disaster in it's production and writing and it does slightly show. The film reminded me more of The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), or a Mission Impossible; it skipped around from enjoyable scene to scene, but you don't always have a clear reason why. The ending also cuts the film of a little to easily and leaves more of an implied resolution instead of a more finite and tactile one. Also the action is far to often shot in some scenes with shaky-cam, and it becomes at times distracting and or confusing. I also wish we had some more close ups of our blood thirsty protagonists. There is one entertaining use of social commentary in the movie, but I wish that it would take the time to make a few more clever insights into the potential-filled lore. My take: World War Z isn't as much of a scary movie, but rather one that is immensely thrilling and suspenseful. It isn't prefect, but it sure is a nice slice of summer entertainment that will get your heart going, even if you leave the theater wishing for a little more food for thought.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

He is the one constant throughout the film. Other characters were not as developed.The action starts early in the story. The viewer is thrust into the thick of things in a way that might be too abrupt, but the premise of the movie is that the global issue developed so quickly that the authorities could not contain it.The action is consistent. Once we understand what the problem is, the story quickly--through the efforts of Pitt's character--takes us to the heart of the action. We are transported from one location, and its tasks, to another. A claustrophobic feeling is achieved through darkness, confined spaces, offscreen sounds, and even rain. The mood is consistently engaging.The suitability of the ending might be argued, but I was okay with it. It did have an abrupt feeling, like other films that set themselves up for sequels.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

But it is also very ""detailed"" in a sense, that it at times shows the Undead very up close and personal and they even have some interesting behavioral qualities. The zombie masses are surprising in their efficiency at and in their persistent strive to kill (recommended in 3D). In some tense episodes we can get acquainted with the personal qualities of individual zombies quite closely, like a clapper of teeth, inspired by hunger. Or something similar. This film, like many other end of the world films, contains a good scene of a regular morning, when everything looks normal, but then suddenly a mass of people starts attacking other, peaceful and pacified, mass of people, who are unable to resist in any way. One can sense hundreds perishing (and then rising). The turning of fortunes towards the living is the story of this film.Interestingly enough, I had the impression of a ""green message"" this movie was somehow supposed to convey - that the zombie epidemic was Mother Nature's punishment for the Mankinds ""evil ways"".

The blood-curdling shriek of these zombies was still ringing in my somewhat shaky ears an hour after I left the theatre; I didn't need to see human gore dripping from their mouths as well every time I closed my eyes.I am about two-thirds through the novel and can verify the objections of those who say it departs significantly from its source material, but so what? I recall the famous author who, when asked how he felt about what Hollywood had done with his books, waved his hand at his library wall and replied, ""Hollywood hasn't done anything with my books--they're all right there."" Besides, the novel begins with the conceit that it is not the ""official"" report of the war historical commission--the overarching narrative--but rather, a collection of oral narratives of various survivors from around the world. Hence one can approach the movie with the view that Gerry Lane's (Brad Pitt) story is just one of them, although one that turns the conflict in favor of humanity. Or, think of it as the Cliff Notes version. Either way, see the movie for the thriller it is (oh boy, is it!), then read the novel for a collection of other survivor stories and the sort of detail that could not be adapted to a cinematic structure.Were I to quibble, I'd rather the movie had not diverged so far as to have borrowed the 12-second bite-to-zombie transformation from 28 DAYS LATER. There are few known toxins that work that quickly, let alone any virus, which has to commandeer the DNA of a cell and reproduce itself in order to take over the host organism. But I rather liked the war-changing discovery that the screenwriters invented just for the movie in the retrofitted third act. It's a doozy.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Very fast pace, lots of scares and tense moments, and besides everything I noticed that the movie managed to keep a hold of the whole audience until the end where I watched. There were a couple moments where hysterical laughter and collective sighs were heard throughout...Now as far as doing justice to the book, it veers off pretty quickly, the main difference being that in the book you get several different viewpoints that end up forming a bigger picture. I had no expectations going in as soon as I read online (about a year ago) that ""the zombies were running, they were the fast kind"". Every fan of the genre knows that it's unusual for something positive to follow this last two sentences, so I was expecting something more along the lines of ""28 Days"" instead of ""The Dead"" series (which does no justice at all to the book).I can understand people getting angry about this as someone who appreciated the book, that this was actually a waste of an excellent book in its translation to the cinematic format, but since I had no expectations to begin with, the ""running zombies"" ended up adding to the overall pace of the action, and with the best 3d rendition I've ever seen in a movie, it ended up feeling more like an amusement park ride than an actual movie experience. The only major critique is the way it ended, it left me with the impression that the production topped out of their budget before they noticed they had to end it...All in all, totally worth a watch. The 3d is natural and gorgeous, and makes the whole experience very involving. Coupled with the pace, it was FUN.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

We expect to see social order breaking down, ripping itself apart, just as we expect to see the undead ripping out the guts of all their hapless victims. World War Z looks to be the end-all-be-all zombie flick, with zombie outbreaks exploding all over the world. Regardless, I wasn't expecting much, given the turbulent production history behind this movie (resulting in the entire last act being re-filmed at the last minute) and the watered-down PG-13 rating.If nothing else, this movie gets the ""World War"" part of it right, while giving some good attention to the ""Z"" part. The action hits early and fast, and hardly lets up until the last act. For the first two-thirds of the film, the characters are constantly on the run, having to face danger on all sides, with hoards of zombies pouring out at them. These are zombies that run, sprawl, and hurl themselves at everybody in a frenzy, which could only be topped by the spazoid zombies in 28 Days Later. At key points, they become a vast sea of bodies rolling over everything. As bizarre and intense as these images are, they are slammed into the audience's faces to hard that it becomes exhausting and jarring.......until those last forty minutes, which were completely reshot and inserted into the film for what the producers felt would be a better ending. Frankly, I'm glad they did; as thrilling as the rest of the film is, I was finding it tiresome, especially in regards to the narrative. In the last act, the action slows down, the camera stops shaking, and the scenes become gripping more out of suspense rather than heavy-handed action. These last scenes are actually my favorite part of the movie, and I probably would have liked it a lot better if the film was made this way all the way through.As it is, however, the film feels like a long string of scenes loosely tied together with a flimsy plot structure. It's a pretty contrived series of events; the hero predictably hops around the world simultaneously protecting his family and trying to find a zombie cure. There is no particularly good flow from one scene to the next; the guy just gets told where to go next, and then he's on his way. The film tries very hard to make the characters compelling, thanks to putting the guy's family into danger, but none of them are that well developed or even interesting. Things are made even more iffy with the occasional stupid moment (chief among them, the department store looting scene, the landing in Korea, and every moment where characters make noise to attract the zombies). There are a few smart moments though: who would have thought that taping a magazine to your arm could be an effective zombie deterrent? Having never read the original book, I'm not sure how close of an adaptation this film is (I read that it isn't close at all). From what I've seen, the book touches upon some interesting thematic territory regarding politics and isolationism. The movie ports over some similar themes, thanks largely to its international locations and situations. As the zombies roll over Jerusalem, anti-isolationist themes emerge, suggesting that no nation is safe from war, no matter how secure the borders are.The film uses some very herky-jerky camera moves most of the time, and it can get tiring very quickly. There are occasional moments of good photography though. Editing is good. Acting is okay from the cast, but never felt exceptional to me; same goes for the writing. This production uses okay-looking sets, props, and costumes; special effects are not bad. The film has a pretty decent music score.World War Z is a decent thrill ride of a film, but little more. I felt it could have been better in many ways, but it'll satisfy most movie-goers looking for a quick and fairly safe thrill.3.5/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Pretty Good)","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was amazing to see some of these special effects. There are many unanswered questioned such as the nuclear blast that caused Brad Pitt to lose cell phone reception. There was a lot of good stuff in this movie though. If you can overlook the plot holes, you will love this movie.

From all those negative stories, you would be forgiven for expecting an incoherent vomit of a movie; that it's not only easy to follow, but also well made and gripping is a massive plus. WWZ tells the story of a mysterious global pandemic, the source of which is unknown, but which turns the majority of the earth's population into rampaging zombies. We see the outbreak from the perspective of Gerry (Brad Pitt) and his family, as they witness it first hand while stuck in rush hour. From there, Gerry – a former government agent - is coerced back into action to find a cure and it is action all the way until the end.You have to admire this movie on many levels. It's supposedly a summer 'tent pole' release – traditionally a time for family movies - yet, it features lots of zombies running around biting people while getting shot in the process. There are panoramic shots of zombies running amok and the ensuing widespread destruction. And even if the bloodletting and gore levels are appropriately sanitized and restrained for the summer audience, still you have to revel in the joy of an actual summer zombie movie. When has that happened before? When is it likely to happen again?Brad Pitt (looking about 35 here) makes for a solid action hero as he goes through one hellish experience after another. Strangely, he doesn't really have a regular counterpart/sidekick to bounce ideas/dialog off, resulting in a lot of him asking questions on behalf of the viewer. The one time it seems as if he's going to get a sidekick, said sidekick is dispatched rather quickly in an unintentionally amusing fashion – presumably to give Brad/Gerry more to do. Furthermore, there isn't really the usual secondary subplot to cut to and as such as we see the chaos unfold mostly from his viewpoint. This has the unforeseen consequence of giving the movie a very 'chaptered' form; one-off events – almost like little mini-stories in their own right - take place in one country after another with their own beginning middle and ending and usually as Pitt the lone protagonist as the witness.The zombie action is excellent and we see suitably large-scale set- pieces of wanton zombie destruction. There is a level of scope and ambition here that you just won't see in something like 'The Walking Dead'. Though it has to be pointed out that those wide vista shots of the zombie hoards building 'ant hills' to scale walls happens only a handful of times in the movie. Even at that, you've probably already seen them in the prevalent trailers, which admittedly takes away some of the 'Wow Factor'.Now onto the aforementioned 'productions problems' and 're-shoots' that littered this movie's gestation. It's hard to evaluate it without taking those 'issues' into account. Why? Because the telltale signs are so evident. The story takes strange turns, focusing on some elements while completely ignoring others. For example, early on in the story, we see Gerry and his family rescuing a young boy – who we assume Gerry will semi-adopt and become a surrogate father figure to since his offspring are girls; this is how it seems it's being set up - yet the child is never seen or referred to again.Similarly, Gerry later takes a wounded Israeli soldier under his wing but she is so underwritten and cipher-like, you wonder: what's the point? If that's not enough, then take a high profile actor like Matthew Fox (of Lost); he features early on in the story and you assume he will figure prominently later; instead, he just shows up a handful of times in what could be the role of a background extra and one not worthy of Fox's talents. Just like John Cusack's shorn role in Terence Malicks's 'The Thin Red Line' (1998), what you begin to suspect is that Fox too was a victim of all the re-shoots/re-edits and his arc probably featured more prominently in the earlier version. And if you really want to nitpick, a scene at a facility, while admittedly a stand out that's very well executed, still feels very glued on almost as if it came from a different movie. Yet another legacy of the re-shoots? Probably it certainly feels that way.As for the pandemic, a reference is made to rabies early on in the story, then it's never really mentioned again. It's vagueness like this that rears its head again and again. Still, it's not the disaster that had been foreshadowed by some members of the media. Yes, it may feel chaptered but it's an intelligent film – for a zombie movie, anyway – that has stuff to say while showing you big spectacle. You really get the impression that this is truly a global pandemic.And that's the one thing this movie has going for it over a lot of movies of the genera: take any of the Romero zombie movies or any zombie movie from the last few decades, and what you find is the action/outbreak is always restricted to small areas/backwater towns. Not so here – this is the real zombie deal on a massive scale. For the first time ever, you see a zombie apocalypse taking place in cities in populated streets and not just on some back road in the middle of nowhere. But there has to be a trade-off: you can do spectacle or gore but you can't do both. That type of thing costs money, and if you're spending a lot of money, you want your product to be seen by the widest audience possible – meaning what essentially boils down to a bloodless zombie movie. Still there is enough good material in here to keep you interested and make the idea of a sequel/sequels a not altogether unwelcome proposition.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I also have a great deal of respect for Pitt as an actor. So this movie was all set up to be a big winner in my book. It wasn't badbut it was a bit underwhelming. Like I said, I like fast, adrenaline-charged zombies, as in 28 Days Later. But these zombies were too fast. They looked more like locusts. Also, this story is really about humanity's fight against the Zombie pandemic, rather than about one family's struggle to survive it, so I didn't feel very invested in the protagonist's survival. Don't get me wrong, the movie was good, but I just feel that I would enjoy the book more (although I haven't read it), because the story is more of a cerebral chess match or puzzle than the action blockbuster that the film's producers tried to create.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out www.livemancave.com","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It was really convincing. The movie however, barely scratched the surface. It would be almost impossible to wrap that book up into a two hour flick but they could have used more elements from the actual writing. It seemed to to me that they just took the idea of the book and created their own story for it. The characters in the film were basically composites of the people that Brooks wrote about. The film was fun enough to watch but it could have been any zombie movie really. It just didn't have the ideas and depth that Brooks brought to the reader. I don't think that they even referred to the virus(Solanum) at all in the film.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The Zombie character is a symbol of the blue collar office workers that drone to the corporate hive and than totter out in wearing a blank facial expression. Zombie epidemic is impossible and Zombie movies epidemic is pointless for quite some time. Longer than the first draft (of many, we learn) of world war z. While Gerry lane (Brad Pitt in a reasonable but unmemorable performance) prepares pancakes for his kids as the ex-UN officer-turned-homemaker that he is, a growing army of the undead is spreading through every city. Brad is called from retirement to try and find a cure. After a brief and rather cryptic meeting with a virologist, Brad heads to Jerusalem to examine close hand the solution they effectively devised against the Zombies. As an Israeli, I was surprised not only by the fact that the Israelis actually solved a problem but also from the visions of unity between Israelis and Arabs. In one scene, Arabs and Israelis were standing and singing peace songs in unison. Maybe such an eminent threat will make us Israelis and Arabs set aside our differences and unite us all as one family but it definitely won't turn us into the Von-Trapp family.Gerry (the formerly retired UN officer) has little time to dwell on the petty. After a brief session with a Mossad official with the least Israeli name anyone can think of and after roaming in in a city that never won the ""Jerusalem lookalike"" contest ,He continues with a wounded female Israeli soldier named ""Segen"" (Hebrew for ""Lieutenant"") to the last resort to cure the world of this endemic. Some of you might think I'm a little light handed when it comes to quotation marks but I assure you there is no one named ""Segen"", the Jerusalem in the movie has very little resemblance to the real Jerusalem and the entire premise and plot evolution seem like one big quotation mark that's not worth quoting. The authenticity problems with the Jerusalem of WWZ is meaningless to the 99.99% of the people who, in my estimate, have never set foot in it. The thin plot and the flatness of all characters but Pitt's are the movies major flaw and when the sluggish pacing (especially during the last half hour) builds in for the big climax, it's poorly executed and the pieces of the story are rashly held with a duct tape dialog. The flawed writing is evident by the realization that if the (few) surviving characters would have fallen victim to the epidemic, it wouldn't have mattered one bit to the story's appeal. I'll go the extra mile and wildly speculate that the extensive rewrites made the problem even worse.I think the movie's biggest problem is that it misses its mark. If it's meant to be a Zombie movie with a hidden criticism of human ineptness, it loses to the masterful ""28 days later"", if it's a one man journey in a dystopian apocalypse movie than it waddles behind ""I am legend"". I have seen these aforementioned movies many times and I assure you I have no plan to see WWZ another time. The only good reason to see this movie is the opportunity to write a snide review in which I strongly suggest to Hollywood to bring the zombie movie genre to a final overdue rest.The zombie metaphor, it seems, is undead too.5 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The answer is, you can't really. And as much as ""World War Z"" tries to abide by the MPAA restrictions by replacing the skin tearing horror aspect of today's zombies with high amounts of action and suspense, at the end of the day this is still a PG-13 zombie movie that seems to have left most of its visual potency/potential on the cutting room floor.Synopsis: Brad Pitt (who looks like he just came off the set of that Chanel commercial) plays Gerry Lane, a family man who is just trying to eat breakfast with his wife and two daughters when the zombie apocalypse hits. But little do the zombies know that Gerry is equipped with ""a special set of skills"". These special skills (I guess) give him the ability to be one step ahead of everyone else in the movie, while simultaneously the ability to continuously claim to have no idea what's going on. Oh and let's get this joke out of the way. Yes, his character does sort of adopt a young Latino child little a less than half way through the movie. Coincidence? Side Note: OK, so I haven't read the critically acclaimed Max ""son of Mel"" Brooks novel that ""World War Z"" was loosely based on, but I've heard the allegations of how only the name was used, while pretty much all other aspects where scrapped. And though this may anger loads of people who loved the original source material, they need to get over it because this is nothing new in the world of Hollywood adaptations. Plus, there is much more here to gripe about than a non-existent adaptation.But first the good stuff: In a movie like this where your average viewer is all too familiar with the villain(s) at hand, what audiences really want to see is something new when pertaining to the zombie look or mythos. So it was not surprise that the things I enjoyed the most about ""World War Z"" were the few aspects of this zombie movie which could be perceived as fresh or different. Such as: addressing the eccentric ways other countries would deal with an outbreak of global proportions and presenting these particular zombies as an unthinking mass liken to a psychotic mob that quickly devours cities full of people like locusts.While it does speak to how post-heavy the CGI is when Brad Pitt is on record criticizing the look of a movie he financially backed, for the most part the direction from Marc Forster (Monster's Ball, Quantum of Solace) isn't bad. In fact, his direction is more or less the reason ""World War Z"" is way more entertaining and suspenseful than it has any right to be. That said, the visuals are hindered by a story with hardly any preface and a troubled script that is unbearably sentimental at times.Along with a few battle sequences and more than a few stretches of unexpected suspense, Pitt's performance is a smaller, but still prevalent reason as to why ""World War Z"" is watchable. He does his best here, much in the same way Tom Cruise attempts to save ""Jack Reacher"", especially during the overly melodramatic lulls when audiences may be pleading for some kind of action. There is also one really memorable cameo from character actor David Morse (The Green Mile) who plays a toothless Ex-CIA Agent. And while he is only on screen for a few minutes, he does make enough of an impact to garner a few lines in this review.OK, so I know you thought that I was never going to get to them, but here are my gripes: There are basically two huge factors which hold ""World War Z"" back from being a strong recommendation.1. How the zombies look and act: In mass quantities (shot from extremely long distances) the zombies take on the terrifying feel of the aforementioned swarm of locusts devouring everything in their path. But in latter scenes, when Pitt must go one on one with these zombies (in extreme close ups) their mannerisms do come off as involuntarily spastic and awkwardly laughable.2. The PG-13-ness: The cut-aways here are nothing short of embarrassing. When somebody gets attacked, Forster cuts. When a solder has an appendage cut off, Forster turns the camera away as if something more interesting is going on on the other side of the room. Suffice to say, when any kind of violence that could beget blood or gore rears its head, Forster cuts away in a back handed constant reminder that, like a small child, there are things in this movie that we (as audience members) are being shielded from. I guess you could say that as much as Forster does to make this tame zombie movie entertaining, he does just as much to relegate it to the B movie status that it takes on.Final Thought: Filled with suspenseful, entertaining and surprisingly well thought out moments, in the end ""World War Z"" is too PG-13 for its own good. And even with the few ""new"" zombie elements, I would never expect someone to pay for this movie if they have access to a zombie television show with more brutal realism and better writing.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

In World War Z they had success to deliver a credible plot, credible behavior of the ""alive"" people (with some small flaws, little dumb choices) and a credible outcome. The scene at the traffic is simply impressive, for example.So that's it!

With a very troubled production behind it, 'World War Z' at one point was thought to be scrapped and not released. With the script going under re-writes, scenes being re-shot, the film going almost $100 million over budget and rumours that director Marc Forster and Brad Pitt had a falling out, it is safe to say 'World War Z' has had a bumpy ride before it had even set off. As for the film itself, Paramount are hoping the bad press surrounding the production is over shadowed by the film hopefully being a box office success and pleasing not just mainstream audiences, but fans of the novel too.Brad Pitt plays Gerry, an ex worker for the U.N and now full time father and husband who is caught up in a world wide epidemic. A zombie virus is spreading the globe and taking one country at a time. After taking his family to safety, it is now up to Gerry to go out into the world and try and find the cause of the virus and possibly a cure.Marc Forster has always been a director who focuses in characters, and here he is no different. The film isn't about the zombie virus, but more about Gerry's determination to get to the bottom of the virus and return to his family. This is Forster's best film since 'Finding Neverland'. Forster was hand picked by Pitt (who produces the film also) to direct and you can see why. Most film makers can fill the screen with violence, but if we don't care for the characters at the centre of the film then the violence can seem gratuitous. Don't get me wrong, the film is filled with blood and gore, but Forster never looses focus of the characters involved in the situations.Pitt gives a solid lead performance and all the supporting cast are excellent too, including a short but crucial cameo by David Morse. 'World War Z' does have its problems. We are less then 10 minutes into the film before we are swept away into the plot. Personally I would have liked to spend some more time with Gerry and his family, but the characters still become well established as the film goes on. The script also doesn't forget the political source from the original novel. We hear how different governments are going about tackling the virus which leaves our characters questioning if they are trying to go about their mission the right way.The script is full of edge of your seat moments. I can't recall the last time I was ever as tense whilst watching a film in the cinema. The action set pieces are great and the script tries to pull our characters way from certain clinches that may be found in this type of film. The soundtrack for the film is provided by Muse and is nothing less then spectacular. I saw the film in 2D instead of 3D and not at one point did I see any shot or set piece where I thought I was missing out on the 3D experience. The film was great without paying more money to wear a pair of glasses.Certainly the best film of it's kind since Danny Boyle's '28 Days Later' and proof that you can breath new life into a genre that is always being recycle. Tense, terrifying and utterly terrific, 'World War Z' is the best blockbuster of the summer so far.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

The movie was fast paced, had a lot of action and for the most part it was a very interesting movie. The acting was good and there are several heart felt moments in the movie. If you have your heart set on seeing a gore fest typical Zombie flick you might want to find another movie. There is a PG13 rating for this movie so it is tame in comparison to a lot of other movies in this genre.

This story is not told in the book, and the ""solution"" postulated by the movie is not, to the best of my recollection, included in the book.

The hardcore fans of this book, like the ones of any book made into a movie, love to pick every detail and flaw out and claim this movie is crap. Yes it is not a 10/10 movie BUT it is definitely worth the see. I read the book and I though it was absolutely amazing. But from a realistic view point they could have never pulled off the book word for word. It just would be impossible. For those who have not read the book the story is basically a compiled series of interviews with people who experienced the zombies first hand. Now the book tells the stories of over a dozen people that have no real connection, only the single fact that they are dealing with the zombie outbreak is what makes them simular. This would have been IMPOSSIBLE to make into a successful movie. The way this movie was made was terrific. There was no boring 30 min start scene, it truly started intense right off the bat. The SFX were good, the story was good, the acting was great and is set up in a way were they can make multiple movie about different people and their experience.

Think of it as a biological warfare gone haywire and as a former UN employee, your previous boss and your conscience is dictating you to save not only your family but the also the world. The plot just revolves there but the transition of the scenes, character development and denouement were well executed enough to let you go through the next hour.And since its a zombie film, the thrill factor lets you scream on your seats or curse the characters on screen.

With it's melodramatic dialog, intense action sequences and Brad Pitt, it elevates a rather tiresome genre to new heights. While the film is absolutely stunning as an action thriller, it lacks in one of the most important elements of an apocalyptic drama...characters that the audience can relate to and sympathize with. Running at a little over an hour and half, World War Z could have easily been a three hour epic that included great characters along with its great action. Unfortunately, it fails to deliver any memorable moments throughout the film. Overall, World War Z features a good performance from Brad Pitt, great action sequences, and a story in the vein of Contagion.

But I'd read enough reports beforehand to realise that aside from the name of the film and the soldiers calling zombies 'Zeke', everything else from Max Brook's work was pretty much discarded.That's frustrating to know given the source material, but as a fan of zombie movies in general I thought I'd at least give it a shot. That shot means there's two hours of my life I won't get back.It's badly paced, the zombies are more like the a poor version of the 'infected' from films like '28 Days Later' or 'I Am Legend' and rather than be an interesting story, it's comes across as an excuse to show off Brad Pitt's acting chops.Now I know Brad gets grief for his celebrity lifestyle and some really really terrible perfume ads, but generally I quite like him as an actor. This had the potential to be an ensemble story told from numerous perspectives. Failing that making the lead have any kind of personality may have helped. Instead it's Pitt going into a terrifying zombie encounter followed by a talky bit. Rinse and repeat.The fact these kinds of films (and I would very much throw it into the group of 'The Day After Tomorrow' and '2012') make money is quite tragic for the industry. They'll continue to make these films and people will continue to waste time watching them. CGI floppy zombies flying across the screen are not scary. You feel no empathy for any character, there's no real grandness to the scale of the zombie apocalypse, the score is filled with loud 'bangs' for the sake of making you jump but builds no atmosphere and no emotion. The score wouldn't have sounded out of place from a Van Damme film rather than a film budgeted at a reported $190m.To watch this as harmless entertainment it's frustrating, to watch it with any thought of World War Z the book or even audio book, is downright painful. I just can't figure out for the life of me what they spent the money on. It certainly wasn't the script.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

The film had to be revived with re shoots and a different ending.The result is a modest success even though the film is not without flaws.Pitt with his long ironed hair which must surely be contender for best supporting actor Oscar (the hair that is, not Pitt) plays a former UN troubleshooter who left to raise his kids in New York city.Suddenly an outbreak occurs where people bite each other and soon become zombified with blood-lust.In order to protect his family Pitt with a virologist goes to Korea to locate the outbreak of the source and a possible answer. Well the virologist takes a nasty fall and Pitt ends up in Israel and later Wales where he might have discovered a chink in this worldwide pandemic.World War Z is an adaptation of a popular book but liberties were taken with the adaptation, especially the ending as the original cut of the film was deemed to be too grim.The film has great scenes of panic with zombies on the loose, zombies attacking as a team as in Israel but some of the lines and scenes make you wince with its cheesiness and lapses in logic.This does not mean its terrifically entertaining. The film starts off the blocks with a bang, there are some visceral scenes depending which cut of the film you have seen and it does rack up the tension.It is rather refreshing to see a film being so successful when it had such public post production issues.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

"9","/10","World War Z Takes Zombies to a New Level","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2820748/?ref_=tt_urv","seaview1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0774754/?ref_=tt_urv","26 June 2013","Brad Pitt has gone from youthful sex symbol to versatile actor and producer. His biggest project to date is this filmic adaptation of Max (Mel's son) Brooks' novel, World War Z, chronicling a massive, worldwide zombie apocalypse. For a subgenre that has ranged from classic horror, (Night of the Living Dead), to science fiction, (Resident Evil), to modern updates, (Dawn of the Dead remake), and parodies, (Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead), this film represents a rare depiction of the zombie invasion as a global, mass annihilation. Previously, these films focused on a small group of survivors (TV's The Walking Dead) with a news blackout and no idea as to the magnitude of the infection. After publicized problems with the screenplay and director Mark Forster's (Monsters Ball, Finding Neverland) rough cut (particularly a climactic battle scene), a new ending was shot, and the result is a remarkably engaging film. Gerry (Brad Pitt) and his wife, Karin (Mireille Enos), ready their two daughters for school and get caught in a traffic jam in downtown Philadelphia. Suddenly all hell breaks loose and panic sets in amid an invasion of zombies who are bent on mindlessly attacking and converting humans into the undead. As cities fall worldwide, the infection spreads exponentially with startling speed as the family flees to Newark for supplies and a lifeline from Gerry's former UN boss, but while the family finds a brief refuge aboard a US Navy ship, Gerry is called into service to find the source of the infection or risk having his family kicked off the ship as non-essential personnel. Tracking down random clues across the globe in such disparate locales as South Korea, Israel, and Wales, the trail for a cause and potential cure proves challenging as time runs out on humanity. In many ways, this film, which shares much in common with pandemic tales as Contagion, Outbreak, and The Andromeda Strain, is more a thriller than horror, and that's not a bad thing. Rather than relying on gross out murders and graphic blood spattered effects, this film looks at the bigger picture without sacrificing the more intimate moments of sheer terror, not an easy balance. Don't let that PG13 rating fool you! Some scenes are suspenseful and agonizing as the threat of zombies is ever present. The film, particularly in the Newark apartment scenes and an unbearable moment of truth at a World Health Organization lab, is like one big funhouse ride where the scares are just around the corner. Other memorable set pieces include the opening pandemonium in Philly, which is well crafted and builds to an alarming level, a walled in city of Jerusalem stunningly challenged by a growing sea of undead, and perhaps the best moment, a horrifying passenger plane flight from hell that starts innocently enough but quickly devolves into an impossible situation.The film takes the scary notion of fast running zombies from 28 Days Later and adds even more lethal traits as in their ability to not only swarm like insects, but to hurl themselves with great ferocity at their intended victims even through car windshields. Their victims aren't devoured as in other films, but rather a bite turns them into more zombies almost instantaneously. They are also real sensitive to sound as Gerry learns at the worst possible moment.What distinguishes this film above most others is its smarts. The script, while written by many hands, still shows an intelligent approach to a devastating crisis, and the dialogue never sounds phony. Further, the film is like one big mystery with nature's clues in full view waiting for Gerry to piece together a solution. Some of the plot points are a bit open ended and push the limits of plausibility, but things move so swiftly and convincingly, that most won't mind. The supporting cast is effective in brief roles with a strong turn by Daniella Kertesz as a soldier. But this is Pitt's show, and he is the right leading man who has the presence and charisma to carry even a zombie film. Being able to improvise and display cool under pressure, he is the ideal savior that the world needs. Perhaps his Gerry is guilty of being too perfect, but he does it so well.(It is amusing to note that Gerry and his family become guardians of an orphaned boy, and one wonders if Angelina Jolie was smiling at the parallels with her and Pitt's real life, nuclear family.)With a mega-budgeted production, the CG effects are a standout especially when creating the hoards of zombies, and there are many effective camera shots with some particularly startling, overhead views. There is also great use of sound effects that add to the visceral chills while the brooding, pulsing music score (Marco Beltrami) complements the tension. A thrill ride from beginning to end, World War Z is a thoroughly entertaining, scary epic that takes the zombie lore and heightens the stakes with an impressive budget and a star turn by an actor/producer at the top of his game.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

Another thing that turned me off in advance was that media focused on Brad Pitt's and Angelina Jolie's private life during the movie's release. The rumor has it that the producers feared World War Z didn't offer enough material for the press and opted for this, although Ms Jolie's closest relation to the movie was visiting it's premiere with her husband.Yet all this conditioning was misguiding, because World War Z offers more than enough solid entertainment and serious storytelling. Sure, we're talking about zombie apocalypse unleashed upon mankind and the main character searching the four corners of the Earth for the cure. This premise alone raises questions about the realism and the level of discussion. On the other hand, World War Z shows the consequences of a contagion spreading rapidly across the globe and the consequent dissolution of civilization as we know it.For an apocalyptic action move World War Z is surprisingly well done. The plot held my attention and never turned boring.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

First off, I actually saw this before I read the book, and now I have read the book and realized they left out all the book's key elements: While the book was shockingly graphic and very violent, with thousands of people being killed, this film has practically no blood, even the unrated version could have passed as PG-13 like 15 years ago! I'm not just mad because it's bloodless, but because a movie about most of the world being wiped out and murdered, probably would have some blood, but no- none during attacks and none on the streets. The best blood we get is on a few of the zombies. The book had details on battles, fake cures, safe houses, effective weapons, and global impact. The film features the global impact, and nothing else. It's very frustrating because the book is a recipe for the perfect zombie film- just remove the interview style and you've got the base for one of the best zombie films ever made. I'm not trying to tell you that you will not be entertained or scared, because you will, but that this is not for someone expecting a zombie flick. This is much more a fast-paced action movie (like every film now that's not a comedy or a romance/drama). It's just a great example of Hollywood's way of using the same plot and same watered down rating for every movie until they get lucky and actually make something successful or decent. On the bright side, World war Z does include some breathtaking scenes of the zombie takeover, and an old school ending, but just don't expect The walking dead or Dawn of the dead, or any other real zombie film/show, or you will be disappointed. Just enjoy the ride.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Arguably the best zombie film since George A. Romero's classic 'DAWN OF THE DEAD'!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2819045/?ref_=tt_urv","Hellmant","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur15977902/?ref_=tt_urv","22 June 2013","'WORLD WAR Z': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)'WORLD WAR Z' is probably the best zombie film since George A. Romero's 1978 classic 'DAWN OF THE DEAD', despite it's PG-13 rating (the film should have been rated R but the studio bought a commercial friendly rating for it). Romero was a big influence on the writer of the book it's based on, of the same name, Max Brooks. The book 'World War Z' is a 2006 sequel to Brooks' popular 2003 hit 'The Zombie Survival Guide'. It's a collection of different characters' accounts of a ten year zombie war and what follows. The movie deviates quite a bit from the book and centers on a retired U.N. agent (played by Brad Pitt) that travels around the world looking for a way to stop a zombie apocalypse. It was written by Matthew Michael Carnahan (who also wrote the political thrillers 'STATE OF PLAY', 'LIONS FOR LAMBS' and 'KINGDOM') and J. Michael Straczynski (who's well known for creating the popular sci-fi TV series 'BABYLON 5' and the comic book 'Rising Stars'). Two of the best writers in Hollywood, Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof (who both wrote over thirty to forty episodes of the immensely popular TV show 'LOST'), rewrote the entire third act of the film. With all that talent attached to writing the script you know you're going to get something good! Marc Forster (director of 'MONSTER'S BALL', 'FINDING NEVERLAND', 'STRANGER THAN FICTION' and the 2008 Bond film 'QUANTUM OF SOLACE') directed the film. The result is nothing short of spectacular!Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a retired U.N. investigator who is now a stay-at-home dad as the film opens. He's stuck in traffic in Philadelphia one day, with his wife Karen (Mireille Enos) and two daughters (Abigail Hargrove and Sterling Jerins), when the world suffers a zombie outbreak. Gerry and his family survive the night, on the run, and make it on to a roof top where they're rescued by Gerry's former employers. He's then asked to go back to work and travel the world looking for a way to stop the zombie pandemic before it wipes out all life on the planet. Realizing his family won't survive if he refuses Gerry reluctantly complies.The film is a masterpiece of the horror genre. It's also the first zombie film to take it's subject matter this seriously (since maybe Romero's early work) and portrays it (for the most part) realistically. Some fans of the book hate that it strays so far from it's source material but if you look at it just as a film inspired by a book (rather than the book in movie form) you should be able to enjoy it more. Even the author, Brooks, said Stracynski's last draft of the script was ""amazing"" and 'Aint it Cool News' claimed the film could have many arguing ""whether or not a zombie movie qualifies as 'Best Picture' material""! I doubt it will be nominated for best picture but I agree it should. It's taken the horror genre, and zombie films in general, to new heights in respectable filmmaking. The filmmakers compare it to the 'Bourne' movies but I think it's even better. It works as a political thriller, an exhilarating action film and a creepy and disturbing monster movie. Pitt makes a great 'thinking man's action hero'; he rarely ever fights or uses a gun but instead thinks his way through every situation. All of the characters are intriguing and there's great cameos from the likes of David Morse and Matthew Fox (in a very small part). The film is full of great suspense, fast paced action, spectacular visuals and cool zombie moments (and the zombies look and act great). Forster's directing is more than adequate but once again it's the four grade A writers that really make the film work. It's full of good plot development and amazingly clever dialogue (with lines like ""Mother Nature is a serial killer""). The movie should make George A. Romero proud.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGWqCYOhcJs","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

For the last ten years filmmakers have churned them out, in what is mostly motivated by the basest of financial considerations. Luckily World War Z takes the zombie concept in a slightly different direction than traditional films. In the same vein as 28 Days Later, only on a global scale, WWZ is arguably the culmination and most fitting depiction of the concept of the ""Zombie Apocalypse,"" and one hopes its final reiteration. While it is too deeply flawed to really recommend to anyone outside zombie and action fans, the zombie genre couldn't hope for a better send off. The film is reminiscent of Steven Soderbergh's Contagion only much less dull. Though Contagion had the advantage of having an interesting antagonist, it also got bogged down telling one too many personal stories. In the end, Brad Pitt's central character, as unrealistic and epically significant he is in WWZ, is compelling enough to hold our attention. This movie doesn't really necessitate a bad guy, though a little more characterization might have helped. There are some good cameos I must say, but Pitt is what holds together this shambolic travelogue of a story. And considering the situation, his blunt exposition never seems forced. His character's simple mantra and guiding survival tactic (always keep moving) defines the attitude of the film. No one could accuse this reworked script of being too talky, that's for certain. As action sequences goes, it is quite striking. But the film's problems are evident in its generic clichés and predictability. Brad Pitt's character is essentially a superhero, which in any other movie wouldn't be a problem however in a movie that stresses gritty realism and a foundation in hard science it just seems awkward. One scene in particular will test your suspension of disbelief, and maybe even ruin the film for you. As I mentioned before, the film was adapted from the book of the same title, and its ending reworked at the last moment. Whether the new ending played better than the original we may never know, but the tonal shift from bombastic to more subdued climax makes sense. The film would have been well served to provide us the opportunity to absorb and process what we seeing more often.My only real complaint is that it never differentiates itself from the rest of the genre in any meaningful way, content to rely upon established zombie mythos and imagery found in any video game or B-horror. Though initially shocking in their animalistic disregard for their own bodies much like some swarming insect, the film none the less makes use of countless stock grayish, growling zombies, last-second escapes, and flickering fluorescent lights. In the decade since the masterpiece that was 28 Days Later, nothing in the zombie formula has really changed; good enough proof that the zombie phenomenon should probably cut its losses while it's still ahead.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

According to the storyline description, he was a former UN investigator. After a zombie outbreak he gets to a UN ship with his family. There, he is assigned to take a scientist to Korea to search for a cure. But the scientist is killed as soon as they land on Korean airport, and afterwards, instead of returning to the UN ship, he assumes the scientist's role and tries to find the cure himself. This came to me weird because he plays both a soldier and a scientist. I think for this reason his job is never mentioned.Technically, there are almost no gore scenes in the movie. Camera moves away each time someone is attacking another. Instead of that, swarms of zombies attack the cities.

It WHOA-ed me enough to buy the tickets 2 days before the screening. World War Z is the mother of virus-spreading-zombie film! Less than 5 minutes after the intro credits, the action already begins. No slow introduction, no rubbish talks. From New York streets to New Jersey apartment to Pyeongtaek military camp to Jerusalem fortress to Belarusian airplane to Welsh WHO facility, trust me, you will be GLUED to the screen, because the action are non- stop. Quoting my pal Fairuz, ""there's no resting while watching this film"". Your adrenaline rushes, anticipating and dreading of what would happen next.Salute to Brad Pitt for giving splendid performance as the (retired) UN- special-officer. The Pepsi-drinking scene is quite cool. After surviving the holocaust in the US soil, he's given the task to protect a promising-young virologist Dr. Fassbach in searching for the cure, the vaccine of the pandemic. Little did they know, what awaits them in South Korea. Didn't recognize any of the other cast, except for the WHO doctor, whom triggered my usual ""who the heck is this dude/chick? So darn familiar!"" sense. Later found out that he acted in Angels & Demons and Narnia.The zombies look real enough. Have the standard of rabies-infected- people like in Rec. They're vicious and fast and intelligent too. They react to something and they refuse to something. I won't spoil that. But I just gotta say this: the piling up to overcome tall fences is pretty sickening! I never thought Zombies could that. That's why I said, the Zombies in WWZ are smarter, than their cousins in Resident Evil or Dawn of the Dead. World War Z is like the fusion of Contagion, 28 Days Later, Dredd, Rec and Resident Evil. You enjoyed those films? Well, you certainly will LOVE World War Z then. Even if you haven't watched them, you would still be entertained.Verdict: Satisfaction-GUARANTEED! ;D","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

World War Z is an interesting rendition of a zombie apocalypse that engulfs the whole world. Implausible? Nope. It's meant to be that way. The premise is interesting, the epiphany too is unique in a good way. Brad Pitt is great as usual, and the supporting cast just about got the job done. The suspense and thrill is there and the frames tick along at a rapid pace, leaving little time for reflection.What I didn't like was the makers going for flashy over smart and sensible. I refrain from giving spoilers which would elucidate my point but there's more than a couple of scenes where you go : ""Why would you do that?"". Also, for a story like this, character development is very important. It helps the audience develop a sense of attachment with the actors and have a better understanding of what they are going through. Again, overlooked.However, it's still a great movie, and totally worthy of your 2 hours.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

To a large extent, I was right: zombies are not prevailing and often not even visible, there are versatile places of action, and the protagonist's activities are supported by high-minded goals (sometimes the latter is stressed too much, however).Brad Pitt (as Garry Lane) is pleasant as usual, but the whole movie is too focused around his character, and there are only a few memorable supporting actors - e.g. David Morse and Peter Capaldi. Proceeding from the logic of events, the presence of Lane's family is superfluous; so are some story lines.Nevertheless, skillful directing and big budget (different locations, mass scenes, digital effects) have helped to create a smoothly running script, with some unexpected twists and expected ending. If you like epic-apocalyptic movies, you will enjoy World War Z and have sympathy with brave people and non-sympathy with the undead...","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Luckily I saw the film and I enjoyed it without having to make fun of it. It was genuinely exciting and it's thrills were well staged and put together. World War Z's issues are there and those would be that the film is uneven. It jumps from location to location until it ends. It had good pacing and a serviceable plot but the movie jumped around more then I would've liked. The little girls did a poor job of acting, thankfully they aren't in it much. Overall the film is flawed but enjoyable popcorn summer action film without having to turn your brain off.

And there are moments where it's done so well, yet at the same time there was so much more they could have done with it. I can imagine all the ways this movie could have made a massive impact in pop culture.Things I like:
1. The plot. The whole ""world plague"" story that's in every zombie movie is done so well here, and traveling around the world was great.2. The zombies. It's so unique and fun. Zombies being fast and strong makes them so much scarier and more dangerous. It's like a zombie movie in hard mode.3. The cure. It's actually very smart and is foreshadowed in a really nice way throughout the film. The whole ""Mother Earth disguises its weakness as its strength"" thing was really good.4. The score is actually surprisingly really good at times.5. They're not afraid to call them zombies.Some things I felt could have been done better:
1. Dialogue. It's so awkward at times and the delivery is very weak.2. The action. There was so much potential and I'm not saying it wasn't fun, just could've been even more fun with the concept that they had going.3. Climax. It was predictable and not that thrilling if I'm being honest. Wish someone died amidst the climax for some tension and suspense.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

My only problem with the story of this movie is that it was like a ""rinse and repeat"" at each scene or at each country the lead character goes to. It plays out like this, they went to this country, it was a dead-end then a new clue arise then they go after that next country, same sh*t happened and it goes on over and over again, it's like listening to an 8 track album on repeat.Having said my problem with the story, I however finds some positives on that negative and that is in each scene in each country, they are upping the ante and they upping the stakes. Each scene just gets better and better and each scene just gets more tense than the previous one whether it'll be in an open space or a remote closely tight space. It was engaging and fun to watch. I also love that they called the undead zombies and they are not referred to as 'walkers' or 'undead' or even 'biters'. Just plain 'ol zombies.Acting: Solid performances from the cast especially Brad Pitt, unfortunately though, the film suffers from minimum character development as it just focused more on Pitt's character. Brad Pitt's character is family man in this movie and his performance can really convince you, his family is his drive and his inspiration towards the success of his mission although if the family had died earlier on in the movie, it will not affect the movie overall, they are just a way for the character to show that he still retains an attachment to this world and someone to call to if he's doing fine or not.As I said, the cast turns in a solid performance despite short screen time and development but what really caught my eye in this movie is the performance of the zombies. It was very convincing and honestly very scary. The twitches when they are transforming and the way they make the bite sounds just makes it much more effective and clearly shows that they are hungry and targeting you. This is the performance for a zombie that I haven't seen in any other form of media.Action/Violence: This film was action-packed on the second half which gives the film a nice shift in tone. As for the violence, it wasn't brutal per se because most of the zombie bitings or eatings happened off-screen or it was shown from a distance. If it was shown though, there was almost no blood present. This is my minor complaint for the violence in this movie, it was a zombie flick, we need some zombie violence, but we didn't get it. I just hope that we'd get an ""Extende/Unrated Cut"" I will definitely check that out.Music: Marco Beltrami was the one responsible for the score in this movie and as I looked at his track record, it's mostly composed of action films and horror films. His score in this movie is no different except for the fact that it is a mixture of both of these and the outcome is really good. It worked really with the movie and the way it plays in the narrative of the movie was good too because it kept up on the tone of the movie.Cinematography: I loved it. It was able to show the grand spectacle of this movie and was able to show how this epidemic had happened globally. But there are three shots that really stood out for me, the first is the transformation of the zombie, it was scary and only glimpses of those shots were shown but it was effective. Second is the pile of zombies just climbing the big wall it was incredible to look at. Lastly is the hallway scene, it was full of tension and one pulse pounding moment.Direction: I'm not a fan of Marc Foster because I've only seen few of his films. I think his best work 'Stranger Than Fiction'. His direction of this movie really surprised me, I like the tone he went for the slow start and the fast-paced tone of the second half. The mixture of drama, action and horror was also good and it worked really well. I also liked how he directed the zombies because like I said before it wasn't like any other and he made them scary again.Overall: I had a good time watching this movie, it completely surpassed my expectations. It was a fun thrill ride that will make you bite on your nails 'cause of all the tension happening on screen. However the film does suffer from repetitive content but each scene gets better and better. This is a great zombie film that i both refreshing and entertaining, I give this one a 4/5.Favorite Line: Andrew Fassbach: Mother Nature is a serial killer. She wants to get caught, she leaves bread crumbs, she leaves clues... Mother nature knows how to disguise her weakness as strength. ----------------------------- Gerry Lane: If you can fight, fight.

An intelligent story is sharp and it cuts you as cleanly as a scalpel while implanting itself into your brain leaving little evidence that it was there. At the opposite end of the spectrum World War Z employs the bludgeoning technique, utterly obliterating your skull into a bloody mush of hair and bits of bone. This is one of the only movies that I have ever considered leaving midway through. With each scene came a fresh onslaught of disregard to the human psyche and with it my uncontrollable urge to cringe in horror of how poorly written this film is. This is not a film in which you tell a fellow human to rush out and see in theater or even wait till it comes to video, unless that person is your mortal enemy. I would not advise seeing the movie at all even if for free. There are more constructive ways to spend your time.

Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) a top-notch UN investigator is called out of retirement to stop the invasion. Yeah, I know another Zombie movie as if we don't get enough of them including those on TV too. The only other Zombie movie IMHO that was any good was ZOMBIELAND with Woody Harrelson. But, let's be clear: Zombies do not exist. Right?Actually, this one is pretty good. Yeah, I was surprised too. Hey, Brad Pitt is in it and he doesn't do bad movies. There is a lot of CGI going on for vehicle crashes and hoards of Zombies attacking everything in sight. Gerry's job is to find out what can stop this invasion and he goes to S. Korea where it is believed it all started, to Israel and then to Belarus to the World Health Organization Research Center there. When Zombies are not on screen, the acting by all is very good as is the suspense and tension. Okay, okay, the Zombies were good toofor Zombies. I wouldn't call this scary, but I wouldn't let little children watch. There was one scene where I must have jumped back about 20-feet. No, I can't tell you what scene that was. I want you to jump too. I shouldn't be the only one. See?You don't see any gore except in one scene where a hand is chopped off so that person -who was just bitten - wouldn't turn. Okay, I did cringe some. See, when you watch a movie you have to believe what you see is real (It's only a movie, Bob).How would you end an invasion of Zombies (they don't exist, remember)? Think about it for a minute or even while watching. Gerry Lane comes up with the answer, short term though it is. But, it is very clever. Oh, there are clues along the way and later Gerry puts it all together. Will you see the clues? Huh? (7/10)All in all pretty good for ""another"" Zombie movie.Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No. Only soft stuff and not much of it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

So I was automatically looking forward to watch this, especially the fact Brad Pitt was the lead role, however the re-writings worried me, but I'm glad I wasn't disappointed at the end.So the story is zombie apocalypse and Brad Pit as a UN agent is trying to find the source to be able to create the cure. I think the rhythm of is fast, and it shouldn't leave you bored, in fact at some points the intensity of it keeps you on the edge of your sit – I didn't expect that. The performances are fine, Brad Pit never disappoints me, and for me it's interesting to keep seeing James Badge in movies as small roles acting with big stars (Ironman, Flight, and Shame). In my opinion, Foster has done a fine job in directing the movie, first he's made sure his visual effect team has done a proper job, then he's created very interesting events throughout the movie, and then he's made sure the tone is realistic; for example, I hate seeing in movies someone drives with one hand and looks at a different direction and nothing happens, but this doesn't apply here. I believe Foster wants to create the atmosphere of the story as believable as possible for the audience, and I can say he's succeeded. I've seen some reviews saying the ending is not proper, why the hell not? What doesn't make sense to you? I don't understand why some people want everything to be shown and told to them and not use their imagination or their brain to complete the story when every element is given to them. I know they reshoot and recreated the third act, which it hurts a scene, but it is still satisfying to me (I'm also curious about the differences since the author, Max Brooks, liked the first draft of the screenplay). Also the soundtrack is done very well, it's very effective both in the opening montage (which I love it) and in the third act – I'm glad this year composers are doing wonderful jobs for scoring movies.Overall, I recommend this movie and try to enjoy it in theaters, if not definitely buy it; I give it 7.8/10.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

It's on us to change that.""Marc Foster is a very versatile director. I loved his work in Finding Neverland, an imaginative drama. He's also directed The Kite Runner, Monster's Ball, Quantum of Solace, and Machine Gun Preacher. He has worked with very different genres and for the most part I have really enjoyed his films. World War Z was no exception, and he proves now that he can make a great suspenseful thriller. I was at the edge of my seat for the most part of the film and there were several heart pumping moments. I hadn't had so much fun in the movies for a while. Of course the film has its flaws, but I was highly entertained with this Summer blockbuster starring Brad Pitt who once again single handedly carries the film. The film reminded me in some ways of Soderbergh's Contagion although this film is more linear and straightforward focusing on one character. It isn't your typical horror zombie film where you have a lot of blood and gore everywhere. In this film most of the frightening scenes take place without showing much. I thinks this is much more effective in a movie than focusing the attention on the gore. O was really pleased with the film. I have to admit I had never heard about the novel which was written by Max Brooks, but I have heard this film is only loosely based on it and has taken several screenplay liberties. The screenwriters did a decent job with the story, but the real fun was watching the fast paced zombies chasing after Brad Pitt.The film centers on Brad Pitt's character, Gerry Lane, a former UN investigator who has decided to retire and spend the rest of his life serving pancakes for his wife, Karin (Mireille Enos), and two daughters back home. Everything changes when a strange viral epidemic begins to spread very quickly affecting every human being and turning them into zombies in question of seconds. These zombies aren't your typical slow paced zombies, they actually move pretty fast and aren't so dumb. Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena), Gerry's former boss at the UN, calls him back for duty considering the urgency of the situation. Apparently Gerry was one of their best investigators and so they ask him to try to locate where the virus may have initiated in order to find some sort of vaccine to treat the disease and stop it from spreading before it is too late. This investigation takes Gerry across the globe, beginning at South Korea, then Israel, and finally ending up in Nova Scotia. Along the way he encounters several secondary characters that give him insight as to where the disease might have begun. A former Israel military officer named Segen (Daniella Kertesz) joins Gerry in his pursuit.The film is packed with suspense and thrills and will have you at the edge of your seat from the very beginning. It probably begins stronger than how it ends, but it still is a great experience. I loved every second of this film and was completely entertained despite the lack of character development and the lack of any explanation whatsoever as to how the disease may have begun. Marc Foster succeeds in creating a suspenseful and gripping movie and despite all the production problems they seemed to be experiencing during filming, the film still ended up looking great and surpassed my expectations tremendously. Don't expect it to be a gory zombie film and you will be very pleased with this exhilarating film.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

He's preparing to be sent to some of most undesirable places on Earth to investigate war crime, find out who's stealing humanitarian shipments, and validate/refute claims of genocide. But, while living with his family in Philadelphia, he is called back into service when a ""zombie apocalypse"" occurs. In order to work up a vaccine for pathogen, Gerry is tasked with tracking down ""patient zero,"" the original host of whatever creepy crawly causes people to lose skin pigment, cognitive abilities, speech and their sense of humor. Zombie FansI'm pretty sure you will enjoy the movie a great deal. Where it works : Pacing - This movie starts very quickly, 3-4 minutes after credits finish, you start to see the beginnings of very bad things happening in the ""City of Brotherly Love"" (along with EVERYWHERE ELSE). Rarely does it slow down from there. When it does, you just catch your breath and it's off and running again. Effects - Top notch CGI equate to some very original and memorable images/scenes. The makeup and zombie effects are nothing new (more on that in a moment), but there are a lot of wide ""big picture"" or wide angle shots which made my jaw drop. Originality - This film was based on what is purported to be a very good novel by Max Brooks. One person I talked to was upset about the film version, saying it was abysmal compared to the novel. That's not a shock. But the speed & agility with which the zombies move and the ""resolve"" they use to overcome obstacles is nothing I remember seeing before. Where it doesn't work : Gore (or lack thereof) - This is an assumption, but if you are into zombies, you may find this movie a little too sanitary for your taste. It's PG-13, which means that you will find more blood & guts in almost any episode of ""The Walking Dead"" than you will in this film. Standard makeup: veiny, skinny zombies with bad teeth. Story - No spoilers here, this film doesn't present you with the nice clean time-line most films do. Be prepared to have lingering questions.Un-dead ? Ain't nobody got time for thatIf you enjoy action/suspense....give it a shot. I think you'll be glad you did.Where it works : Pacing - This is an exciting movie. It's starts quickly and really does keep genuine tension very tight through the length of the film. Just pretend the zombies are terrorists or bad guys if it helps you with suspension of disbelief. Performances - Everyone in this film is wholly believable in their roles, from Pitt on through to the supporting cast. There's not a great deal of ""star power"" but it does feature solid actors and actresses who take the story seriously and turn out a movie no one should be ashamed of. Story - There is a ""solution"" to the zombie problem offered in the film which I found very intriguing and original. Where it doesn't work : Characters - They are a little flat. This may have come from condensing the story from novel to film, which often leads to the removal of most character development in favor of action/events (see 90 % of films adapted from a story or novel by Stephen King). The usual nagging questions - How can zombies move without heartbeat? How do they can keep going so long without rest? Why do they all vote for the same party? (sorry, got a little carried away with that one). All I can say is fish gotta swim, zombies gotta roam.In the end, I wish I had seen it on the big screen and my wife liked it as well.My rating: 7.5 out of 10 (very good)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, all the teasing about ""what I used to do"" from Brad Pitt never pays off. We never learn that he used to be a sniper assassin or an accountant or anything back when he did whatever it did that was so disturbing in his past. That's just one disappointment the film features.

Long story short, this film at the beginning is a bit boring, detailing for several minutes events of how it was and as it happened the pandemic. When action happens, everything is total expectation to keep seeing and to understand why these zombies are different from others seen in other films.This film has amazing actors that really make the film interesting. First, Bratt Pitt, gives rise to a father and husband, strong willed when it comes to defending what belongs to him, his performance makes you not lose the vision in detail what you want to display. The casting of this movie is really good, and the actors didn't disappoint.The story focuses around which goes through the world in a race against time to stop a pandemic that is tearing down armies and the government, and threatening to decimate humanity. The problems faced in the fight to find a cure. It does at times, fall into boredom for wanting to see some action. In addition, you will be on the edge of your seat waiting to see what will happen at the end.A peculiar detail about this film is that it is very easy to identify with the main character (Brad Pitt). We all have moments of fear for our lives that make us cringe.Finally, the way this film is and just when everything seems clarified eventually fall into the sad situation of wanting to see more and especially leaves the viewer with factions in the face of ""It's over"" And suddenly jump in the words ""BUT"" ""WHY"" Overall, this film covers little to how much they have to cover.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Often due to an assortment of production difficulties, the initially envisioned motion picture turns out to be a completely different final film. Famous examples include Francis Ford Coppola's ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979), Sam Peckinpah's ""Major Dundee"" (1965) and infamously, Michael Cimino's ""Heaven's Gate"" (1981), that succeed in putting its studio, United Artists, into bankruptcy. However, conflict doesn't always produce a great film, or even a flawed great movie. Sometimes it just sits on the screen as a catalogue of disaster. If ""World War Z"" isn't entirely bad, then perhaps it is a testament to director Marc Forester's ability to marshal his footage and admit that his present ending was no good and proceeded to film a new climax.Throughout the epic-scale film, elements of a smaller, more personal film are ever present: the sight of a cop, facing the breakdown of civilisation, helping himself to food supplies like everyone else; a drunk on the streets of Philadelphia calmly oblivious to the confusion and violence around him. The surreal sight of soldiers in South Korea, in pitch black, driving rain, cycling on small bicycles to avoid attracting the plague-ridden zombies. The implicit point that countries that are prepared for war, like North Korea and Israel, are better organized for cataclysmic disaster. The deathly, eerily unnatural silence of a Welsh village; these details give weight to Forester's direction, as does the impressively mounted small-scale action scenes such as the initial zombie attack in gridlocked Philadelphia traffic. These scenes are the best in the film and help to displace (but not vanquish) the film's many manifest flaws.Brad Pitt has a commendably intense performance and is backed up by a host of small roles from actors such as David Morse, James Badge Dale and Daniella Kertesz who are all very good, yet their effect is diluted by the unfortunately linear, globe-trotting script that suffers from repetition despite a few ingeniously cruel twists of fate. The constant cutbacks to Pitt's family throughout the course of the film help anchor his character, but they're too short to establish their characters as anything but ciphers, a problem for everybody except Pitt.The ending, while fine in isolation, hardly creates a sense of conclusion while the tacked-on coda contains enough hastily sketched information to furnish two more films, leaving the last ten minutes rushed.The lacklustre computer generated imagery for the Jerusalem sequence is only one of the film's problems in a movie that finally, struggles under them, some due to poor scripting and others because of a lack of literal direction. It's hard to be convinced by it and that may well be its greatest failing.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Once you read the book and watch any trailer, it's clear that the Paramount wanted to make a large-scale zombie film and felt more comfortable basing it on established source material than an original story. Hard to blame them, for as well as Max Brooks creates a portrait of war through documentary- like post-war accounts, very little of his novel could be characterized as cinematic. For a total reinterpretation, however, ""World War Z"" manages to be a welcome addition to the worldwide pandemic/zombie genre. The script speaks to the power of many minds being better than one, with Matthew Michael Carnahan (""State of Play""), ""Lost"" writers Drew Goddard (""The Cabin in the Woods"") and Damon Lindelof (""Prometheus"") and a story by J. Michael Straczynski (""Thor""). Director Marc Forster, as well, shows he's a more capable action director than ""Quantum of Solace"" gave him credit for. ""World War Z"" manages to create suspense and intrigue despite being far from the first film about society breaking down at the hands of rabid flesh-eating zombies.Zombies all too often go hand-in-hand with the horror genre, but ""World War Z"" plays out as more of a thriller and a survival film. Brad Pitt's Gerry Lane must work with the government to uncover clues toward a possible cure, and he also must run for his life when things take a quick turn and his or his family's safety is compromised. His quest takes him to South Korea, Jerusalem and Wales.There's little to ""World War Z"" that doesn't meet the eye. It works primarily as an exercise in tension and thrives on its ability to lend a certain freshness to the genre. Although nothing about the film is unfamiliar to any fan of zombie flicks, Forster gives us the sense that we're experiencing it all for the first time, playing off any prior knowledge of zombies we might feel we have, in a sense, in order to keep us on our toes.Although mostly just a gore-less version of ""28 Weeks Later,"" ""World War Z"" manages not to do anything too stupid to insult the genre or draw negative attention to itself. Considering how far it veers from the popular source material, ""World War Z"" was ripe for derision from fans and critics, but its ability to work as a suspenseful thriller manages to save its value as a blockbuster.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"8","/10","World War Z - A good thriller that satisfies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2817789/?ref_=tt_urv","azureblueflame","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur38550174/?ref_=tt_urv","22 June 2013","I went to watch World War Z with quite some interest and obviously, its not like you get zombie apocalypse movies every now and then... The movie was frankly.. an excellent one. The movie wastes no time in bringing up the main plot of the story and right from the first minute, each and everything is part of it. The thing I liked most about this film is that it delivered everything that it was supposed to, beside a few flaws, the plot was a good one accompanied by a cast that were extremely efficient. Brad Pitt alone took the movie to a greater height with his superb acting. The Zombies were quite well-designed and along with their ideal casualness earned their silly antics laughter from the audience and at the same time, some horror. The story revolves around the idea of a plague spreading 'round the globe which infects people and makes the infected people zombie-like. Also, anyone getting bitten by them were likely to turn like them as well. Gerry(Pitt) and his family narrowly escapes the infected denizens of the New York before getting rescued, now Gerry out of his duty and love for his family, agrees to go on a wild trip to find out more about the disease and whether it has a cure. The plot as I said was a good one, the soundtrack's accompanying the movie well, cast superb, graphics fantastic, It sure did have a few flaws though namely not naming the cause of the disease or about how it actually began, but it can be easily looked over if you look on the positive sides. Though there are some other good movies out there such as Man of Steel, World War Z belongs to a completely different category and along with it's elegance singles out the others, so even if you have no idea how zombies look, you would still love the suspense of this film. All in all, World War Z is a great movie and you would definitely enjoy seeing it even if you are not much of a fan of Zombies, the 3-D effects are good in this one, But 2-D went just fine enough for me. So, in case you were wondering to watch it or not, Do so, you will not regret it.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

So, I was fully open to the story Forster had created to draw in views like me and to some extent he succeeded. I really enjoyed the tension throughout, the visual effects such as the zombies using each other to climb over wall and the story which unlike some other zombie films did not rely on gore to keep the audience entertained. However, the film felt somewhat anticlimactic which is a shame because the jump into action at the beginning of the film showed real potential and I don't think that the characters were developed enough, you knew Gerry Lane was the hero but he's charter had no complexity. They have suggested that World War Z will have a sequel is this is true this would be a film I would be very interested in seeing because maybe this film did not reach it's full potential but I feel it has set up a storey which could create a sequel which could very well live up to it's title World War Z as I really want to see a War with these zombies.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

WWZ was still comfortably the best of this group but I was so put off by modern Hollywood-spectacle I gave up on it for a few years.Nowadays I've learnt to avoid most of the modern stinkers, or quickly skip through them if they're clearly pants. 10 years later decided to give WWZ a rewatch and it was very entertaining! Jumping from a 6/10 to an 8/10. It has quite absurd OTT zombie-action, with excellent CGI to make it all seem relatively plausible (their behaviour recalls swarms of parasite-infested ants). Brad Pitt is an engaging lead. The little bits of 'science' are welcome, even if this movie is more of a 'turn-brain-off-and-enjoy-the-ride' type.The camera is a little too shaky at times, tho' it does suit the action. And the movie is lacking something more substantial or deep about it to earn above an 8/10. Yet if all you want is a fast-paced thrilling action-zombie rollercoaster, then WWZ is one of the best.The King of zombie films remain the immensely immersive and visceral REC 1 & 2 (not 3 & 4!). Essential to watch these in original Spanish with subs. If you haven't seen them yet check them out. The American remake Quarantine is nowhere near this class.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

However, the story in the movie flows nicely and makes sense. I am also very glad that they changed the ending of the movie from the original planned version. I've read about what they originally had and it just sounded like a mess. I also am grateful for the lack of gore in this movie as gore wouldn't make any sense at all for this type of story. Besides massive amounts of gore is over-used and is just a bore now. I am glad the director actually had an imaginative mind and could tell a story using words rather than shock effects. I loved how the movie played out and I loved all the characters in the movie.

Firstly, you get an A-list actor to play the lead. Secondly, you give it a huge budget. Thirdly, you get an A-list director. And voila, you have 'World War Z'.Brad Pitt stars as Gerry Lane, who would do everything possible to protect his family in the midst of a zombie apocalypse. I loved the fantastic opening scene with total pandemonium. 'World War Z' definitely is one of the better and more ambitious zombie films out there. It features a good score, great visuals, good make-up, and fast-paced action. This is a zombie film that is really fun to watch. Most zombie films revolves around the kill scenes and the guts and gore. 'World War Z', however, is a survival story and concentrates more on the characters.Make no mistake, there are a few gory scenes, but they're never too disgusting to watch. This is a zombie film even non-horror viewers might enjoy. There are numerous credibility issues, but these can be overlooked thanks to the film's high entertainment value.Earning a whopping $540.4 million at the box office, 'World War Z' became the highest grossing zombie film of all time. Along with 2004's 'Dawn of the Dead' it is among my favorite zombie films (my absolute favorite being 'Train to Busan'.)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I can only say that I was surprised that I liked the movie. And from what I heard it was the most successful movie Brad Pitt has done so far (Box Office wise that is).So while it was only PG-13 in the cinemas (there will be an extended cut available on Disc soon), it still had a few punches to deliver. Mostly emotional but also action wise. While the director wouldn't have been associated with Horror prior to this, he did a really good job conveying the terror and the tension that builds up in a situation that is depicted in the movie. It is pretty straight forward and therefor somewhat predictable I guess. But I thought they would be aiming at another ending.And if you have heard about the history of the movie you know that they actually re-shot 30 minutes. The last 30 minutes of the movie. Maybe it is apparent to some, maybe not. Shouldn't be a distraction or something that will disable your ability to enjoy the movie though","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

"7","/10","'World War Z' is a thrilling zombie epic that provides plenty of adventure despite suffering from a simplistic episodic structure and zero character development.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2897607/?ref_=tt_urv","hughesreviews-co-uk","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur47635830/?ref_=tt_urv","1 November 2013","Zombies have become the 'it' monster of our generation. Forget the vampire and werewolf antics of the 'Twilight' films and its imitators; they don't have squat on a cultural phenomenon that echoes societies contemporary concerns regarding social unrest, anarchy and the complete loss of social order. Sound like I am thinking too much into it? Think again. Since George Romero single handedly invented the whole genre with the release of 'The Night of the Living Dead' in 1968, this is a genre, like a sharp sci-fi film, that can provide a fabulous basis for social commentary. 'Night of the Living Dead' was concerning race relations in the 60's, 'Dawn of the Dead'; a scathing remark on consumerism and 'Land of the Dead'; an examination of Bush era politics and class divide. You would be surprised how the mindless consumption of human remains by the undead is such an effective method of philosophical observation.George Romero knew this with those aforementioned films and so does Max Brooks. This is a name that has become synonymous with zombie enthusiasts, having written the well-received zombie novels 'Zombie Survival Guide' and 'World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War'. This is where the movie review starts to come in. The makers of this film adaptation did not seem to agree with what Romero and Brooks knew. They have removed the political and social elements present in the book and made it more of a straightforward action thriller.'Quantum of Solace' director Marc Forster gets the job of managing the chaos. Not just on screen, but behind the cameras as well. Or so the rumour goes. Even so, rumours or not, 'World War Z' never feels like a film which had a turbulent production; despite an episodic structure that lacked a certain sophistication in the writing department. If you had your cynical hat on, you could very easily see it as Brad Pitt rather unimaginatively going from A to B to C while evading the hungry dead. Forster directs 'World War Z' in a much more comprehensible style than the dire 'Quantum of Solace' and he never allows the film to slow down for a second. Within 10 minutes, zombies are swarming cities and Brad Pitt has no choice but to travel the globe in search for the origin of the virus; with the hopes of finding a cure. We go on an exotic world tour to many exciting locations such as Philadelphia, New York, Jerusalem andCardiff? Yep, unusually but quite entertainingly un-climatic, the finale of the film does in fact take place in no other than Wales; where Peter Capaldi, in a piece of poetic coincidence, plays a character credited as W.H.O Doctor.Horror enthusiasts and B-movie genre geeks were the only people who ever saw zombie movies and anyone who appreciates the films of Romero will understand how far the genre has come. It's taken as long as one of the undead for the genre to be picked up by the mainstream; but here we are. It has become so popular and mainstream that Brad Pitt stars in one! – one of the biggest stars in the world.This induction into the mainstream ethos has not rendered the genre unchanged. The most significant modification has been the introduction of what can be only known as ""running zombies"". There are Romero zombies and the sprinting 'Dawn of the Dead' remake zombies. 'World War Z' takes the running zombie craze onto a whole new level. It would be a mistake to think these things were dead. They move faster than anything that has a heartbeat and have a prolific predisposition to rugby tackle anything in sight. Including walls. They're unlike any zombies seen on your screen before and may actually have you soiling yourself in their sheer ruthlessness.With the film trying to appeal to a wide audience, there is a deplorably limited use of blood. This does not work in the context of a zombie film. Gore goes with the territory. 'World War Z' is essentially zombies for dummies and anyone who knows the genre will feel that. Nevertheless, this is not for us sad fans, it is for the younger generation and the people who are going the cinema to watch 'Avengers Assemble'.Therefore, inevitably, with modern technological developments and current cinemagoer tastes, we get CGI zombie hordes. The CGI is perceptible more than it should be but the effect of seeing an ant like colony of zombies invade a walled city makes you appreciate the tools in which it was made possible. There is some genuine shock factor and unique surprises in store. The invasion of Jerusalem being at the forefront of my mind. Us zombie fanboys have always dreamed of seeing a sequence like this.The film is a missed opportunity for something with real bite, instead of a project that has a bit of chomp and limited flesh. At it's core, this is the American hero saving the world story again, but if you can get past that cliché sentiment; 'World War Z' can provide you with the perfect mix of thrills and excitement. As long as you have your brain turned off.Like this review?

The acting, however, is what makes the film. Brad Pitt gives an understated performance and the supporting cast is excellent, especially Mireille Enos as his wife and Daniella Kertesz as an Israeli soldier. I've read a good number of reviews from people who read the book and found the film disappointing. I have not read the book and did not have expectations as high as that - perhaps that is why I wasn't disappointed. Yes, there were a few weak points in the plot, but on the other hand I found action sequences very well put together, and given the logic of what the Pitt character was thinking, I found the scenes in Wales well designed and quite exciting.So, no, it wasn't up to the level of 28 Days Later, but I thought it was at least as good as 28 Weeks Later, a film that lost its way halfway through.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It's an action-centric PG-13 zombie film with a major actor in the foreground to draw in mainstream audiences for a guaranteed box office success. I've heard nothing but awesome buzz about the novel from Max Brooks that loans the movie its title (and apparently not much else) but I've not had a chance to read it before seeing the movie. I suppose this might've helped me keep a more unbiased perspective when watching it, since I wouldn't spend the movie grumbling about all the wasted potential in the source material. Nope, instead I had my own series of gripes with the film. Primarily, I hated that the movie seemed more interested in crafting major action sequence after major action sequence than actually creating an engaging plot. I wouldn't go so far as to call WORLD WAR Z a bad movie, but it's certainly the epitome of mindless summer entertainment. The movie follows former U.N. investigator Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) as he and his family struggle to survive once the zombie apocalypse erupts across the world. Once his family is secured on a naval vessel, Lane is roped into joining an investigation into the origins of the zombie epidemic. Lane jets off to start his investigation in South Korea and will follow the trail around the globe in hopes of finding the source and, maybe, a cure or vaccine to save the planet from collapsing under the scourge of the undead.Let's start with a minor quibble. What sort of fun can you expect from a PG-13 zombie film? Seriously. Zombies are rotting, shambling undead with a hunger for human flesh. But WORLD WAR Z spares us any real violence or gore associated with the zombie genre, instead giving us swarms of indistinguishable zombies and bursts of mostly bloodless gunfire. The zombies in the film are (mostly) your typical fast-sprinting, growling beasts. Some discoloration of the skin and a bit of blood around the mouth, with the occasional bit of facial deterioration when you're lucky enough to see one up close. No disembowelments or half- mangled zombies with their insides out. It's all toned down to fit into its more audience friendly PG-13 rating. The zombies are treated as more of a global virus, swarming and climbing over obstacles in tidal waves of faceless monsters. Their shot and blown up without any payoff and the victims are never more than tackled and vaguely munched on, convulsing on the ground before jumping up to join the masses. I don't know. Maybe I'm just old- fashioned but I miss when zombies weren't yowling athletes who run down their prey at super speeds. This leads into my next major problem with WORLD WAR ZThis movie is all about the massive action sequences. Plot takes a back seat to elaborate action scenes on a global scale. As if to make sure you know what you're in for, the movie gives you little to no time to introduce its characters. We get five minutes of a family pancake breakfast with Gerry, his wife, and their two daughters before we're thrown right in to the first major action scene: the fall of Philadelphia. From then on, we get bits of character development to fill the quiet moments between explosive action scenes as Gerry begins his globetrotting mission. The scenes themselves are pretty impressive. I'm not going to deny that. When the zombies invade Jerusalem, it's a pretty awesome sight; and the initial chaos in Philadelphia sets the tone for the film pretty effectively. My problem isn't with the action or its execution; it's that it's the main focus of the movie. Just as with QUANTUM OF SOLACE, the plot here is nothing but filler for when people aren't running from zombies or slaughtering them by the dozen. The best part of the whole movie (for me) was the final act when Lane arrives at a World Health Organization center in Wales where the bombastic action steps aside and allows for some quiet suspense. The Wales portion of the film is exactly the sort of stuff I love in a zombie movie. Taut and thrilling with our main character stalking through a facility trying to avoid confrontation as opposed to just running in, guns blazing. I thought the final resolution was a nice touch. Lane's major discovery that is meant to turn the tide of the war against the zombies is an interesting development, but I wonder how it took so long for someone to formulate that theory. Someone had to have noticed it before Lane had his realization so late into the zombie war. Whatever. Thoughtful storytelling isn't exactly this movie's strongest point.WORLD WAR Z is a perfect example of mindless summer action. Leave your brain at the door when you settle in for this one and try to find fun in all the gunfire and zombie hordes. You won't want to try and think about this one too hard. Kudos to Brad Pitt for his role in the film. Pitt's a great actor and he brings some gravitas to a genre that doesn't often see big name stars in the cast. He does the best he can with pretty weak material, but he's mostly just running from Point A to Point B while avoiding becoming some zombie's next meal. The visual effects are great and the final act attempts to redeem the movie's otherwise shallow, lazy nature. WORLD WAR Z is far from memorable and I suppose its greatest success was provoking me into reading the novel to see what I've missed.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Some scenes were definitely weaker than others, but I did enjoy the fact that military personnel moved and acted appropriately, one of the major flaws of many flicks. I did think the lack of blood and gore to retain a PG-13 rating was a bit disappointing, but they handled it just right so that you didn't feel that it was totally necessary. All in all I definitely recommend seeing this movie.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Its not really different from any other zombie films. This movie is very fasted paced and the zombie outbreak starts in the first 5 minutes, so i wished i got to know a little bit more about the character before the zombie outbreak. A problem i have is that the zombie dont really feel like zombies. They needed to act more like them and needed more blood on them and that leads to another problem. If your gonna make a zombie movie you need to make it rated r. The was some moments with intense blood splatter which i thought was cool but there wasn't enough. Most of the zombies die off screen and we dont get to see the blood and the aftermath of the kills. Brad Pitt was a good choice and did a good job. The movie wasn't scary yet it relied on action more than blood and scares. Definitely one of if not the best zombie movies ive seen so far and i would see it again in the future if i would like to.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Most people don't understand it's momentum and others aren't satisfied with it's devotion to the zombie sub genre. If you take a objective look at the movie I absolutely promise you will be entertained, by the effects and action alone. As for the movie, its not a zombie-horror movie, tell me one damn zombie movie with a conflict resolution.... that's right the genre is based on hopeless survival. Trust me when i tell you, I have seen every god damned zombie movie since white zombie. This movie is meant to be sci-fi horror with zombies as the antagonists; expecting ripped open stomachs, and skulls turning into applesauce, go watch a slasher because this movie not for you. If you want a innovative movie that gives a fast paced mysterious story with overwhelming visual effects then go to theaters asap. Remember that's it's science, not a bunch of kids with make shift weapons barricading themselves from impending doom. Not to say that's not entertaining but it's so refreshing to see a movie that isn't tied down by the constraints of gore, survival, and classic zombie antiques that has caused such a great idea to take a dive in the last decade.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The movie even plays itself like a slightly above average movie. You can tell a little bit more work went into the camera work, the set designs, and the ideas, however, the movie never does anything bold. You don't see any real character development, any real character interaction, or any emotion from the characters other than ""Oh crap, zooombies (because they are fast)"".The Zombie designs in this movie have some nice make-up and always has standard special effects when up close and personal. Fortunately the movie only relies on CGI when the zombies are doing something a human can't. Other than that, the zombies are mostly just quickly edited to appear moving faster. While this is a personal gripe, I never really liked this type of zombie because it didn't make sense. If the movie is pretending to be realistic, then if your arm or body is blown to bits you will not be moving. It doesn't matter if you are a zombie, if you don't have the muscles or the blood then you will not move. For a movie that is trying to make zombies realistic, they are pretty unrealistic.Probably the greatest thing about this movie is that it actually reuses The 2nd Law: Isolated System multiple times. I almost feel like some of the shots in this movie were made just to fit that tune because the shots literally fit the tune exactly.All in all, there is some decent action and moderately interesting moments here and there, but it isn't anything people will remember as being ""revolutionary"" to how zombies films were made. I Am Legend did a better job with a similar premise.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

We only have 5 minutes to get to know Brad Pitt and rest of his family until we are thrown head first into unrelenting action and it doesn't bring us back down until the end of the movie. It was very well paced, and no stage did i feel bored but i don't feel like i'd missed anything either! I voted 9/10 simply because it does have clichés in it, and unintentionally funny moments which ruined parts for me.

Seriously, the first minutes of the film are so damn good, everything happens so fast. I saw it at 2am and believe me, it was an experience. World War Z is an exciting movie filled with intense sequences of violence, horror and fun. I'm not a huge fan of the zombie sub-genre and I haven't read the book. However this one was very surprising to me, I felt engaged with the main character and I cared about his family.Yeah it has a few flaws but it delivers lots of astonishing moments, memorable action sequences and great performances. Brad Pitt performs Gerry Lane's character and he does a pretty good job during the whole film. His character is believable and well... he's actually the smartest character in the movie. In addition, shout out here to Daniella Kertesz, she performed ""Segen"" a very important character in the film. She and Brad Pitt are awesome here.WWZ relies on human perspective and how we would react if something like this happens. Moving on, its final act is scary and makes you feel claustrophobic. Even though the ending does not explain some important issues about the plot, the whole film was pretty solid and never dull. I recommend you to see it on a huge screen with a loud sound system. So, overall, it is a good flick. World War Z is a tense thriller, decently directed and terrifying at times. (B+)","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I've read the book, but apart from the title in common........I did learn something from this film, as well as the vastly poorer zombies movies being released en masse it seems. Zombies in films have had their day. Too much competition from vampires, werewolves, ghosts and scarier stuff now. Mind you, fast, at least human fast zombies, that can think, plan, communicate with each other and use weaponry, might take it up a level, with the usual hunger for human flesh and needing a head injury to re-kill them, might work.

The references to confirmed cases and the non expertise of various commentators, overheard as we watch images of teeming humanity, carry a certain poignancy in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic. Then again, what happened in our real world pandemic doesn't even approximate what's gonna happen in this movie.Whenever there's several people responsible for a screenplay plus the story, even when it's an adaptation of a novel, my alarm bell starts ringing. And yet, despite being no fan of caves in Yorkshire, I find myself rooting for this Brad Pitt movie, for no accountable reason. Unconvincing family dialogue in the first scene but they're so sweet. And then everything goes berserk, within the first handful of minutes. We don't know why or what, so the movie is coasting on genre recognition and advance publicity. All we know is that the Pitt family is a family who enjoy pancakes, and then there's chaos. Pitt is Gerry and some guy on the phone will 'move mountains' to help him, but we still don't know exactly why? Audience is playing catch up from the get go. The apartment block sequence does smack of 28 Days Later. The dialogue becomes weirdly fragmented. ""I'm scared."" ""How do we know they're coming?"" ""Just a walk in the park."" ""Be ninja quiet."" WWZ begins to feel like a videogame with different zones: street zone, mall zone, apartments block, rooftop, etc. The dialogue has the character of those inbetween levels sequences in videogames. ""These guys are hammers."" ""Mother Nature is a serial killer."" They don't put nothing in for nothing, as dad used to say. The cocky British wunderkind tells crucial info to Pitt's character. Guess what happens to wunderkind in the very next scene? Yup. This is blueprint, by-the-numbers storytelling. The rest of the movie is just we-must-save-Brad-so-he-can-save-us.Some exciting moments, but moments are not enough to make a story.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

From that moment on it definitely keeps your attention. Sometimes the downside to movies starting off so well is that it set's a precedent for the rest of the movie to be as exciting, which is hard to do. Thankfully World War Z manages to keep a really good pace throughout, mixing a good amount of action and suspense, and while I understand it cannot be relentless for the entire movie duration, it does get a wee bit slow in places. Fortunately, these moments don't last too long though, and they are usually a build up to some good tense scenes.A lot of the visuals are really superb, especially when you see the big wide shots of the zombie attacks in New York, New Jersey and Israel from the ground and from above. The tension that these scenes build are excellent as well, even moreso when the zombies actually start climbing over themselves to get over the walls in Israel.Watching it all in action you can understand why the movie cost around $190m to make. Nothing is really original about the zombies in this movie in the way they act and the way they move - as 28 Days Later was the first movie to portray zombies/infected as fast, vicious killers - but they are still done really well with suspense being the main focus for them to scare people rather than a Dawn of the Dead type of zombie where it's mainly gore.I had been looking forward to seeing this movie for a while and while overall I wasn't disappointed, it lacked a wee bit of something. Maybe it's because it's really all been done - PLENTY of times - before. Who knows, but what I do know is that World War Z is definitely a good film to watch.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The collaborative scenes of the zombies (such as the scene where zombies use each other to climb a wall) were quite good both from the CGI side and the idea side. On the other hand, the virus spreads ultra quickly. This was not a good idea from my point of view. A whole city gets sick in a few seconds. Acting was not that great I am afraid. A lot of characters just pop up and than turn into a zombie. The directing and story telling was not that great either. I believe the biggest success of the movie was the good advertising. Just to sum up, the movie was not boring and had some positive contributions to the zombie concept. But, it is not a movie that I will remember as a great zombie movie.","0 out of 8 found this helpful.

While I enjoy a summer blockbuster just as much as anyone when they are good (see The Avengers), I can't help but snicker when I see a terrible idea go down in flames (see the Lone Ranger).And so was the expectation with World War Z, director Marc Forster's adaptation of the critically acclaimed Max Brooks' novel. The book was clever in that it was written like a historical retelling of a real event, the event here being the zombie apocalypse. Forster and screenwriter Matthew Carnahan shun most of Brook's narrative style, giving the author's witty concept the Hollywood makeover. It should be noted that World War Z had one of the more troubled production phases in recent film history with rumors circulating that its budget had skyrocketed to as much as $400 million (In reality, it was more in the $200-$250 million range). Recasting, script rewrites, and director-star squabbles were all in the mix which usually is a recipe for disaster come release time. But not only has WWZ defied odds by being a runaway hit looking now to eventually turn a profit, it is also one of the most expertly concocted thrillers in recent memory.Brad Pitt stars as Gerry Lane, a former United Nations investigator who is enjoying retirement playing Mr. Mom with his wife and two children. After he and his family narrowly escape the onslaught of the zombie outbreak in downtown Philadelphia, they eventually are whisked to safety aboard a U.S. aircraft carrier where Gerry is recruited by his old U.N. boss to assist in tracking down the outbreak's source. Lane then begins what will eventually become a globetrotting investigation where he and crew face the deadliness of the infection head on in Korea, Israel, and England.Pitt is rolling into his middle age roles nicely. He plays Lane as a low key, slick government flatfoot whose previous experience in crappy situations helps keep him alive in the madness here. And it is pretty much his show the whole way through. He is aided throughout the film by different groups of people with little development of any of these side characters. It is a small drawback and the non stop thrill ride of the film's events more than make up for it.Forster creates sequence after sequence here that one ups the previous one on the nail biting meter. Brook's zombies are not your slump around, Walking Dead type zombies. As savage as they were in 28 Days Later, the creatures here are even more beastly in their speed and brutality. Forster borrows some from Danny Boyle's masterpiece early on but finds his own narrative as WWZ moves forward. From an airplane landing on a pitch black military landing strip to an escape from an over ran safety compound in the middle of the day, Forster keeps viewers glued to the screen no matter where the setting is. The film culminates in a masterfully paced final act in which Pitt and friends zero in on possible relief for the catastrophic epidemic.WWZ is smart while not being pretentious and exciting without being outrageous. It is everything one can want in a summer blockbuster and hopefully the beginning of an excellent franchise.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

This is a zombie flick, people want to see zombies bite and this movie cuts that all out. The Walking Dead on cable shows more gore than this movie.Brad Pitt is an ex war reporter. One day the city turns to you know what and he's asked to come back into the game. Of course, he doesn't want to, but in order to get his family to safety, he agrees to. First they must survive the night when things turn to chaos, and this was the best part of the film. Then they get rescued and taken to a big ship. Pit is sent on a mission to find the origin of the virus and of course when zombies are involved, this doesn't go as planned. He goes to Korea but the best special effects are in Isreal when the zombies form a ladder and all that ensues there.Then Pitt survives a plane crash, are you kidding me. But get beyond that and he happens to be within walking distance of WHO center and no zombies in sight. Then there is a pretty crazy solution to the problem, but there is an open ending. I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel.FINAL VERDICT: I like zombie movies so I did like this. Basically if they had made it R rated and shown zombie kills, etc... it would have been a lot better. But it's good enough to watch if you need an apocalypse fix.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Humans although are assumed to be survivors we don't seem to have our heads screwed on proper in the jaws of adversity. Whilst some of us have what it takes to survive another some will need support to get through a night when the unthinkable happens. Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) an ex investigator of the United Nations is tested on his survival genes when Marc Fosters zombie pandemic explodes all over Manhattan. Lane and his family are saved a spot on a US battle ship 100 miles off shore on terms that Lane agrees to work once again in co-op with the US Military to find the source of the Contagion. Now that's WORLD WAR Z in a nutshell. WWZ arrives at the zombie party a tad bit behind schedule. DAWN OF THE DEAD, SHAUN OF THE DEAD and WARM BODIES are three titles at the top of my head which makes WWZ just another zombie movie. Clearly WWZ exploded in the box office but why? Was it Brad Pitt or Marc Foster? Obviously Brad Pitt's presence was the lubricant in the well oiled moneymaker WWZ but Foster is The Man if I may say so. Foster changed the game and baffled the audience. The myth of Quality over Quantity is proved wrong. WWZ is all about quantity. The zombies don't walk they bolt. There are lots and lots of them. They don't jump you instead the tackle the spines out of you. They don't eat you whole; they bite you and dash to the next victim turning you in 12 seconds, there is so much happening with CG that the last time I was this impressed was with GLADIATOR. One of favorites of the movie is how Foster creates the fall of Israel this just may get a nod at the awards early next year. While all this takes place there is a subtle question too sent through this Zombie Apocalypse. See if you can pick this up when you watch the movie since it's sidelined with all the action that takes place. Who has a better chance of survival if SARS was not contained back then? A closed society or an open Society?Wrapping up this piece I will admit that WWZ lacked closure to this 116 minute adrenaline rush. It feels a bit like PROMETHEUS. You will look to the left and then to your right and then shrug your shoulders and say ""that's it? What happens next?"" Well there is a silver lining to that since Paramount pictures has confirmed a sequel on the studio drawing boards already with a hopeful return of Brad Pitt.Until such time, this explosion of lots and lots of zombies will have to do for summer 2013. There is enough excitement, ample suspense and dashes of lighter moments that concoct a good movie.TITLE: WORLD WAR Z DIRECTED BY: MARC FOSTER STARRING: BRAD PITT RATED: PG13 RATING: 07/10 RUNTIME: 116 MINUTES","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

In the 1970's they evolved the bite, a faster way to spread whatever it is that makes the victims turn to zombies as well. By 2000's zombies were getting faster than they used to be. And in World War Z, dead zombies easily outrun most people who are alive, underlining the inherent absurdity of the living dead concept. Many reviewers here were disappointed, because they expected to see ""real zombies"" and what they saw was the wrong kind. I really don't know what to say to that kind of logic or lack of one. But what I saw was a pandemic film with humans acting as zombie-like delivery systems for the unknown pathogen. The concept is familiar from 28 Days. In Z, the creatures do not bother to actually die, turning from healthy humans to zombies instantly. World War Z turns out to be a pandemic action film seen from the viewpoint of one individual who never hesitates and never gives up. Brad Pitt just keeps on going, just like his adversaries the zombies do. As an actor he pulls it off well. I really felt for his character, going from one losing situation to the next, although many obviously did not. The single hero viewpoint chosen means that the film has little to do with the novel of the same name. If you want the book, go ahead and read it. One has to accept some plot holes in a fantasy film of this kind to keep the action and suspense going. For me, the combination in this respect was just right. The solution in the end is believable in the framework of the film, based on the supposition that it is the pathogen that controls the zombie and uses it's senses. It took me by surprise however. This is an industrial film and as such uses a lot of safe and proved solutions but there are enough new twists to warrant seven stars. Lack of gore was for me a definitely positive factor, since in terms of the plot there was no need for any.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The action is amazing, I can't deny it. The scene of Jerusalem's wall is incredible. Visually it's great and the CGI is pretty good.
However the rest of the film is completely uneven. Dialogs can be either very interesting and thoughtful or completely dumb when Brad Pitt is with his family.
Brad's not in it for this movie. He acts more like a slug than a soldier in my opinion. One of his worst performances (does not make it awful, we are talking about Brad Pitt).
There is also no character arc or development in the movie. Brad is just a retired dude working his ass off to save his family but you don't learn anything deeper about it, except something about his previous job. Characterization almost as weak as the zombies...
The plot is what it is: a mixed bag of both good and bad ideas with a strong intro and ending but quite a mess in the middle since you follow a character with no particularity whatsoever.
Entertaining, yes! Enjoyable, yes! A wasted potential, yes again. This movie however shows some unique scenes in a movie of the genre and I personally do not regret watching it.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But because of strong word of mouth and the hard work of author Max Brooks, the book soon became a cult hit and then a sensation. When World War Z was published in 2006, it was an instant bestseller, and speculation immediately began on when the book would become a film, with a bidding war breaking out over the rights between Leonardo DiCaprio's production company Appian Way and Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment. Brad Pitt won.And then . . . nothing. For years, the production languished. Costs bloomed. Rewrites were rewritten. Many speculated that Pitt might have a bomb on his hands. Instead, World War Z has been largely a success, with box office totals north of $300 million as of this writing. But the questions remains, is the movie any good?Yeah, it's not bad actually.First, if you are going to enjoy this movie you need to forget about the book. There are homages to it here or there, but for the most part this is a different film that, at best, happens in the universe of Max Brooks's work. The zombies are more akin to the infected in 28 Days Later than they are the walking undead of Romero.Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a former UN investigator who now spends his days flipping pancakes instead of on the front lines of the world's conflicts. But when he and his family find themselves in the middle of the zombie outbreak in downtown Philadelphia, Gerry agrees to go back into the field in exchange for his family's safety. His search for a cure to the zombie plague takes him from Korea to Israel to Wales, with zombie attacks galore in between.World War Z is a pretty good movie, but it has some flaws. First, it's PG 13. Violence isn't everything, but when you have a movie that is about the zombie apocalypse, having most things happen off-screen just takes something away from the proceedings. Worse, the movie feels like it would have been better as a miniseries. The set pieces are disjointed and poorly connected. It's almost as if we are going around the world just cause. These scenes need more fleshing out. And yet, the movie also seems overlong. If it were twenty minutes shorter, the movie would have been stronger, in my view.But I'm being overly negative. If you like zombies, you will enjoy World War Z. It's not destined to be one of the great zombie movies in my opinion, but it is more than adequate for a summer blockbuster, and hopefully its excellent box office will encourage more zombie movies in the future.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This film definitely deserved them. This film had very good action, a good plot, and very good cast. Brad Pitt returns to stellar form after the mediocre Killing Them Softly. Also David Morse and the rest of the main cast provided good performances. The CGI was pretty good, but there has been better CGI done in other films without a doubt. The score by Marco Beltrami was very good as it had the same feeling as Hans Zimmer's did in Inception. All of the characters had very good chemistry with one another and felt very realistic. Even with all the good in the film, there were also negatives I took away from it. At times the plot feels slightly predictable as I pretty much predicted the entire last 10 minuets of the movie. Also, even though most of the characters were very realistic, they are not given much of a background or much substance except for a few of the characters which obviously involves Brad Pitt's. in the end, I feel that World War Z was a very good movie that fell just short of being great. I give it a 7.5/10 and a B+. I would recommend this to action buffs, zombie fans, and just about Nyone who wants a fun summer action flick with a good story","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

That's what you'll get with World War Z, a film that is flash and substance, cranked to insane levels with bucket loads of CGI and little regards for smooth and cohesive narrative which could've elevated it beyond just action and special effects.I'm not familiar with the original novel on which this film is based, but from the looks of it, it seems to be aimed at only a specific demographic; that is those that crave mindless action above all else. There's nothing wrong with that, but I suppose those(like me) that want story and character development ALONG with action, will be disappointed as World War Z, to them, only resembles the original novel IN NAME ONLY. Superficial performances from some of the lead characters, save for Brad Pitt, dull the experience immensely as a film of this caliber demands hard, vicious violence and tense, frightening atmosphere, that, unfortunately enough, are sparsely sprinkled about in this film. There's no doubt that some of the film's action scenes are impressive, but one gets the feeling that because of it's PG-13 rating, a bane of zombie flicks, are so tame that to call it a TRUE zombie flick would be an act of blasphemous disservice. Ultimately, it would seem that with so many rewrites to the script and filming of scenes, it clearly became a case of ""too many cooks spoiling the broth"".The potential for something like this to be greater than the sum of it's parts were here, but the execution of such potential into something natural, organic, and emotionally and intellectually engaging, falls equally and devastatingly flat on it's cinematic ass. World War Z once again proves the inept and ADD-riddled filmmaking process of Hollywood is once again, cropping up and utterly ruining a film's potential to be something great. I'm not sure if I want to see this film again; I'll wait for the director's cut. IF indeed such A CUT exists, then I suspect it would be an overall improvement over the theatrical release, but since it's too early in the game for such a thing, I've no choice but to conclude that World War Z, ultimately, pales in comparison to it's much superior counterparts ""28 Days Later"" ""Night of the Living Dead"" ""The Walking Dead"" and to a certain extent, even the bloody yet comedic romp ""Night of the Comet"" and other notable films of this tried-and-true genre. If a sequel is made and judging by the latest box-office numbers, I don't fail to see why. Only ardent, die-hard fans can hope for the next film that features more blood and guts, more heroism, and most importantly, more character development.","37 out of 91 found this helpful.

It is fun to watch and it has many suspenseful sequences and very fast pace story. Problem was once you saw it - it pretty much ""ordinary"".Well I can understand if people were disappointed. After all it is one of the most anticipated films of 2013 and for the past 2 years they have been giving glimpse of the movie. But it turn out to be ""so-so"".I think the whole Rated PG 13 destroy almost everything. Zombie movie with no bloodshed, who the hell think that? It turns into very mildly violence movie for kids. And while there is no violence they also decide to rewrite the story that everyone can understand. I heard that it was so different from the book that Max Brooks (Novelist) don't want to involve with the movie. Anyway it wasn't all negative. The movie is extremely suspenseful and if you don't expect anything at all it can be fun and a great time passer. While Brad still look great and give a decent acting everyone else was flat.The fighting sequences though not very grand as hope but still very much fun from start to end.I still do recommend it but don't have a high hope and you might actually enjoy this movie.

Glad I did. Not the average mutation movie. Having a cast that keeps to the good writing is a plus. The necessary cgi is quality work also. When I compared it to the hideous zombie encroachment on the US Capitol building it was really hard to find any difference between the cgi constructs and the terrorists.
The rabinous frenzied troglodytes clamouring up the steps were identical, Xerox copies of the WWZ clones. I definitely found the movie versions more entertaining. After all, they are the villains and a villain has to be credible to make the protagonist come off as a hero. The script stayed true to the plot. Written with enough technical support to make it plausible.

It sounds like an epic turn to the genre, bringing a larger scale which a terrifying apocalypse movie should be. The film is basically based on a book that serves a couple of interesting ideas. Disappointingly, it lacks enough ambition to the concept and enough exploration to its world's condition which results into a somehow smaller and generic Hollywood blockbuster. What remains is a sort of ridiculous experience as typical blockbusters go. But it's ought to tell a better survival story and the film couldn't apply all that.The plot calls for a different take to the genre. It features some smart innovations about the viruses, but the execution is more like the opposite. The film isn't quite concern on what's going on around the world other than the risks of the protagonist. Instead of an engaging adventure, it's an expanded version of a cliché zombie thriller. A band of random survivors fighting off and running away from the monsters until they decided to look for a cure. To that point, it instantly becomes a totally generic survival movie. The film can still work for its scale if the journey is well developed, but the storytelling is painfully straightforward and isn't interested for decent characterization and exposition.It's more focused on the action and suspense which are the only great parts of the film. It becomes more and more crazy, from usual running zombies until they climb to ridiculous heights by forming a swarm and throwing their own bodies together. The special effects look fine enough to give these creeps some ridiculous movements. The performances at least made the non-action scenes quite entertaining.World War Z is somewhat gripping, but it's really cluttered with generic zombie movie plot points. It's basically like 28 Weeks Later then ends becoming a less ludicrous Resident Evil. It could have been bigger than what the film has shown, but I guess they don't have anymore stories to tell. People might find it a little fun by the visuals, camp, and the performances. In the end, it's going to be difficult to remember all of that. It's amazing how a great source material became a film that is so uninspired. Now it's just plainly about zombies invading the whole world. And just like most blockbusters today, World War Z is fond for explosions and thrills, and nothing else.","35 out of 86 found this helpful.

There are jump- scares. There are grisly and highly unfortunate deaths.

If he refuses to comply, they'll willingly kick his entire family off a tanker- one of the few safe locations left in the world. From there on, Gerry Lane is forced to transcend country after country in order to secure his family's safety and possibly save humanity. A hell of a lot is at stake, that's for sure. Now, I can definitely state that one of the best aspects of the film is its acting, especially Brad Pitt's, which, as usual, doesn't disappoint. One can clearly witness the fear and terror present in almost every character's eyes, as well as one specific character quite convincingly pulling off the feeling of sheer pain under horrendous circumstances.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The biggest problem I had was the inclusion of some highly improbably events.The cutbacks to Gerry's family slowed the movie down like speed bumps on a straightaway. I would have been fine with leaving them on the ship and not seeing them again until the end. Their subplot did nothing to progress the film and stopped the action at least twice. His wife's main contribution was to place an ill timed phone call that gets two men killed.At one point Gerry drags a Israeli solider along with him for no apparent reason. Just kind of brings her along where she plays no role in the plot that couldn't be filled by an anonymous extra.His miraculous survival of a plane crash is where my suspension of disbelief gave out. And the fact the crash occurs within wounded- walking distance of their destination didn't help.I'm split on the ""cure"" for the zombie attack. It was unique and clever but Gerry's execution and test of the solution was telegraphed thirty minutes before it happened.I did not jump once in this movie. I was never scared or on the edge of my seat.

As I watched WWZ for a second time I realized I had to let go and just go for the ride this film is 2 hours of zombie porn. I watched the unrated cut which has a lot more blood and guts than the theatrical version I saw. That's all this film is, set piece after set piece of zombie mayhem and destruction.

They're the type of Zombie that runs after you with ferocious fury, as seen in films like 28 Days Later, the Dawn of the Dead remake and most recently, World War Z. Pitt plays a family man and doctor who is handpicked to help save the world from retro rigor morts gone rabid. He joins a team of smart guys on a save-the-world world tour that takes him from the States, to Asia, the Middle East and finally to Europe. The first stop is the East. They arrive in a South Korean airport on a dark stormy night where the only survivors appear to be American. The actors playing the Marines sound like they just played Call of Duty to get a sense of the grunt dialect. Each soldier is endowed with a s***t-happens attitude for good measure. ""God damn it! I'm a Zombie!"" Things take a turn for the worse when the genius doctor accompanying Pitt trips, falls and shoots himself with his own gun. Don't laugh! It's not funny! It's tragic! Can you imagine the phone call to that man's wife? ""Ma'am, I'm sorry to say that your husband is dead."" ""Oh no, did he get killed by Zoombies?"" ""Umm, no.... he kinda tripped and shot himself.""Then it's a visit to the Holy Land only to find that Zoombies are seriously intolerant of religion. However, the whole undead apocalypse event is convenient for Israelis and Palestinians as they can take a break from killing each other and team up to kill anything that goes zoom in the night. Unfortunately, ethnic harmony makes Zoombies more bloodthirsty than ever. When folks start singing, the harmonious levity attracts the horrible herd and they begin climbing over each other just to make it stop. World War Z is a wonderland of wow-inducing action. You'll find yourself jumping, wincing and possibly even vomiting as limbs are lost and corpses get carnivorous. You may even scratch your head as you watch Matthew Fox provide the most painfully obvious example of a performance lost in editing. Whatever the case, you will love the smell of necronoids in the morning and rejoice in the glorious gore as you enter the Zoombie zone.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

There is no explanation of why? There is no explanation of how to solve the problem? The ending left the viewer empty. The movie could be gearing up for part 2. Brad Pitt does another outstanding role. He seems to have left his outrageous weird roles like fight club, and True Romance. His new genre seems to be action, family and playing the hero.

With the zombie craze at a all time high there's little left to the imagination and only so many ideas can come to life. I was always interested in the world war z books but never took the time to read them regretfully, so I had high expectations for the film. I have to say I can't find anything wrong with this film. It's so thrilling that I literally was on the edge of my seat though I knew what the outcome might be. I can see the evolution of zombies from slow moving snails to rapid beasts that move at such a haste. Loved this movie and definitely will be added to my list of great zombie movies. Must see film.

I was shocked at how many negative reviews it got, which was simply because most people watched the regular version. The Unrated version had a better explanation in the end and it wasn't futile like the one that came out in theaters. On the other hand, Brad Pitt did a good job, as usual, in this film. Although I was kind of lost to how you could get infected by a bite (normal), but if it gets into your mouth, you're fine. I mean, I know it was rabies, but still. Right? Also, I didn't understand how there was already a lot of noise being made in the inner city: Buses coming in and out, helicopters flying around, police cars etc... But it was the singing that made the zombies go even crazier an build a ladder like wall to cross over? It was a good movie, don't get me wrong, I just think that it could've been thought about more carefully and re-edited. If you watch this movie, I'd recommend watching the Unrated Cut version. The story will probably make more sense, unlike the theatrical one which will probably leave you wanting your money back.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

None of the plot, outcome, or circumstances of the book survive. Not sure what they paid for the rights but they wasted their money.For those of us who liked the book, this movie is very disappointing. To be fair the book is a narrative of a writer going around after the war is long over and that might have been hard to make into a movie. Even so, anyone who knows the book is going to be watching an empty blockbuster while thinking of a well-plotted, thought provoking book.See it if you must, but you might buy the book on Disk instead.

Blah-blah-blah!""Well, The thing about it is, This is how it feels by the end. With Brad Pitt spazzing out on a hospital bed screaming ""WHAT DOES IT MEAN?!"" sounding like Nic Cage and a hilarious scene where his wife calls him in the middle of him trying to get past zombies by being quiet. That's not very quiet, huh?There's a lot of unexpected hilarious moments also, like a cop screaming at Brad Pitt's family in a car before he's RAMMED INTO BY A SEMI-TRUCK. WTF? It's excellently darkly comedic in the acting too. There's a lot of over-the-top acting here too. Not as good as Nic Cage, but I mean, Did anyone expect it to be? No, The answer is no.
If we get to the fine details of the acting (what did that mean?), Well, OH BOY. The wife's actress Mireille Enos seems like she's here for fun (she's constantly smiling and sounding happy-go-lucky-go), She doesn't seem like a bad person, It just doesn't work. Maybe we should've got someone else, I dunno, Maybe Jenna Fischer? Sandra Bullock (wait, no)? Julia Roberts (maybe not)? I kinda could see Lena Heady in the role too actually. Any other actress may have been able to pull off the role better, It's just that the direction that Enos decides to go into (her character is pretty stupid too) doesn't really fit the tone, but it certainly fits the character (what I'm saying is, the tone of her acting isn't very great and that fits her character).Brad Pitt is obviously not that bad, but at the same time it kinda makes me wonder, If it wasn't for his company getting the rights for the film, Would he of been in the film? I kinda wish someone else would've been cast. However, Brad Pitt does indeed fit into the film well.If we talk about the comedy again, IT'S EVERYWHERE. A girl gets her hand chopped off and there's no blood! Even with blood, with how random the chop is, it's still hilarious! The soldier characters constantly spout out one-liners that are either so dumb/bad that you can't help but laugh out loud, or so cringe that it makes you chuckle inside.The zombies are so over-the-top that if you don't laugh, I'll question you. The characters, while seeming to be cliche, I don't mind. The cliches kinda work and make the film feel even more like a black-comedy. I can't praise this film enough, It's hilarious. Plus, The whole zombie-twist, Oh boy, It's so dumb that it's hilarious!While this film isn't a so bad it's good film at all and it's just a overall great Dark Comedy, You will either love or hate this film.Maybe you'll freaking hate it, Maybe you'll freaking love it, Whatever you think of it, It's hilarious.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Since roughly the millennium, we've seen every type of zombie movie - romantic ones, humorous ones, ones from the zombies' perspective. Once upon a time a movie would be a sure-fire success just for having zombies in it. Now the public are getting a little sick of the undead. So... is WWZ too late to be of any importance? No, it's actually pretty good.The closest film to liken it to would be 28 Days/Weeks Later in style and content.

The zombies (and yes, they ARE zombies - there's no going to great lengths to NOT call them that here) can run, ala 'the infected' and you won't find a 'shuffler' in sight (oh, apart from when they're not chasing people - then they seem to happily go on 'shuffler-mode').I was struck by how little gore there was here. A staple of zombie movies is blood and 'head shots,' yet, despite numerous battles between soldiers and zombies, you barely catch a glimpse of the red stuff. Plus, any close-range zombie kills are skilfully edited to avoid seeing any physical damage to the corpse. I can only assume this was to assure the 15 certificate rating which would put more bums on seats in the cinema. There's also barely any bad language (I didn't count a single profanity). So... what is there? WWZ wins out on sheer scale. Its scenes specialise in terror and mass destruction, presenting 'what if' scenarios of what the population would do amidst such an unexpected ordeal. The film follows (former UN health inspector) Brad Pitt as he travels the globe in search of a cure to the zombie virus. Brad Pitt can act (Kalifornia and Snatch being proof of that) yet there's little for him to do here. He's not a ninja, or Superman, so he spends his time running away from zombies most of the time. If I was being harsh I could say that any actor could have played his role, but the film-makers needed a big name to carry the film.If you like zombie movies then definitely give this one a go. If nothing else it's the biggest and most epic zombie movie to date. If you want straight horror, you may come away feeling a little short-changed. I would almost call this a 'thriller' over a horror, due to the lack of gore being replaced by tension and terror.Slight gripe: I watched this in the cinema and there was a fair few people who found the zombies quite funny when they were up close. For some reason zombies 'chatter/clack' their teeth together when they're sniffing the air. It is rather odd and probably more funny than scary.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Former United Nations Secretary-General Jerry Lane is seeking help to identify the source of the disease and develop a vaccine.World War Z is Jerry's struggle to overcome all adversity.
This movie was released on 2013 directed by Mark Forster. This is also one of the best zombie movie ever. Around the world, the disease is spreading from infected people to zombies that attack others. It is a threat to nations and to humanity. Jerry Lane, a former UN official who lives with his family, has been asked to join the team to find the source of the disease and ways to prevent it. But Jerry rejects this demand at first, but has to take on the job of relocating his family safely from the infected area. By the time Jerry arrived, the situation had changed in Korea and in Israel, where the disease had been contained. The answer to whether Jerry and the UN team can successfully complete their mission and save the world?!, is presented in two hours by director. Brad Pitt, who plays the central character Jerry Lane.
It was a box office hit.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

No half- hanging intestines out of body, not much brutal cannibalistic shots.And of course, for die-hard fans of the original book, WWZ is only a rough adaptation.

Sometimes it's good and sometimes it's not. But unfortunately the times it's not good outweighed the times it's good. Brad Pitt is a very talented actor and I've loved him in other movies. And he's not necessarily bad in this film, it's just that the script is kinda lackluster and there are pretty long stretches of time that are just dull and uninteresting. That is one of my number one pet peeves in films, long dull stretches of nothing. I don't mind a longer film or a slow burner at all, with some movie that's just necessary, but I didn't think it was with this movie. They could have at least thrown in some interesting well written dialogue when nothing with the zombies was happening. The special effects were pretty good and so were the action sequences. But the other stuff wasn't all too interesting, just kind of dull and boring. And that's so sad because I think so much more could have been done with World War Z. It had some good potential, but that potential just wasn't taken advantage of. I'm sorry to say that I cannot recommend World War Z. 4/10.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

I haven't read the book, which means I don't need to furiously rant about the film's disconnection from its novelistic counterpart. If you haven't read the book, you have no reason to worry about potential disappointment; that's practically reserved for the book's fans. If you're a book fan, on the other hand, you should be expecting the two's differentiation from one another. So, to put it most understandably, if you're entering this movie the way it was marketed, you'll experience a wild, roller-coaster ride that's fairly effective in its capability of featuring some dramatic moments of diplomatic negotiations and political discussions over the world's collapse and then placing you into intensely impossible situations only to be followed by an incredibly suspenseful, nerve-wracking sequence. It's highly entertaininghowever, it's the furthest from originality a film can get. I mean, it's yet another zombie movie, dealing with the entire world under a deadly zombie virus. You've basically seen everything in this movie already as 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later highlighted the serious effects of such an event already. In that case- during its first act- World War Z feels unbelievably similar to the two films mentioned above. Especially considering the decision to exclude the more political aspect of the novel and turning the adaptation into an action flick instead, there's not much here that'll bask in uniqueness, really.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Because in reality, the success of the film is largely based on these remarkable crowd movements which make this general panic very palpable and therefore at the same time very credible!Of course, Brad Pitt, quite sober for the moment, is also the pillar of the film since he understood and analyzed everything before anyone else thanks to his very specific abilities as a former UN investigator who preferred to be close to his family, but that's what we expect from such a blockbuster!As for the zombies, we manage not to be too frightened because the full horror of the situations is not shown in the smallest details, the director having rather focused on the psychological impact made on men and populations and that is as well so...Some scenes are particularly astonishing like Jerusalem protected by this wall which will prove powerless in the face of the limitless relentlessness of hungry predators or even amusing like the one in the lab where Brad Pitt finds himself facing a researcher who has become a zombie and chattering teeth, a single window separating them!We will not be surprised by the progress of the plot, which is very well written in advance, and even less so by its outcome, which, of course, we could not escape...

Some other times however a film which according to the subject and taking into account previous experiences in the genre is doomed for failure succeeds to surprise in a good way. This is exactly the case with World War Z directed by Marc Forster starring The Brad Pitt.The human race is in danger and the enemy is inside. It is actually us and our neglect to the environment that causes a destructive virus to take over and spread by means of the global airlines network. In a few days or weeks, the danger cannot be hidden, as the virus turns almost on the spot human beings into zombies with enhanced powers and infinite hunger to bite and infect other human beings, and cities and countries fall one after the other into Z dementia. Only tiny Israel (one of a few movies my country comes with some kind of a positive face) succeeds to delay the fate by isolating itself and building a wall separating healthy people from the world-wide infection, but no wall is high enough to stop such an invasion (hear! hear!).The resulting film is pretty entertaining, although the story is not much different that the one told at least ten if not one hundred times. Director Marc Forster seems to try something else with each of the films he makes, and here his rehabilitation of a genre compromised by too may bad B-series movies succeeds, as he can tell a story and creates a few memorable images like the one of the hysterical zombies pyramids, beings that may have lost humanity but gained social grouping instincts, which had a 'Lord of the Rings' quality. Brad Pitt may seem to be a little bit regressing in his acting career, but as he approaches the mid-age roles time he must have felt happy to act again as the sexy savior of mankind, blessed with both muscles and brains.The word is saved again. The only bad news may be that WWZ 2 is in preparation :-)","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

So why do so many have such negative things to say about this? On a lot of movies I view on IMDb it seems that regardless of whatever movie I viewed, there were far more negative comments than positive. So I've come to the conclusion that most people only get online and write reviews when they're disappointed in whatever it is they decided to go see. But, when people are pleased or walk out of a theater saying it was the best movie ever then they're not going to take the time to go online and write about it because they feel no need. Why is that? Why do people feel obligated to express their opinions when they are displeased with something but completely ignore it if it satisfies them? I just don't understand it is all and I read the reviews before watching this movie and went into it with an already negative approach and when it was over I was just in awe. Not only was I impressed with the acting and whole movie period but I was appalled at the negative reviews. So I say give it another chance. If you saw it and was unhappy, try it again.

The tension built up during this film is unbelievable, and it kept me on the edge of my seat for the entire film.

It's energetic, it's entertaining - but more than that it's just a thrilling experience. Overall, World War Z is one of the best action films of the last ten years...is what I'd be saying if the film ended after the first thirty minutes.Don't get me wrong, the rest of the film is entertaining, but the story is very weak, with a lot of conveniences and annoying moments. The action definitely would have benefited from being R/15 rated, as there are a lot of moments where the action is really choppy. Brad Pitt is good throughout, and some of the emotional moments do land, but honestly the film became quite tiresome by the end. So whilst the opening is fantastic and I would still recommend the film on the whole, the opening set up what could have been an amazing film, when it's ended up just being decent.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Who scratches the Hollywood coating off the surface, finds a seriousness underneath that can't be ignored. Sure, the movie has A- lister Pitt in a heroic role and of course this movie is made for your entertainment. Still, it addresses a valid point; the human race is more vulnerable than ever in our global village, but it never preaches. Whether it was the screenwriter's intention or not, World War Z is not about zombies. The undead are brutal – fast, vicious and deadly within seconds – but the biggest fright does not come from these creatures; it is knowing that there is nowhere to turn from a virus that is making victims so quickly that there is no escaping from it. Although marketed as a zombie movie, the movie feels more like a horrific detective. Although the hero is looking for an answer amidst the chaos of a changing world, it is knowing that due to our global network the virus cannot be controlled what makes you feel uncomfortable, if not claustrophobic. The pace of the movie is good and the storyline gives you enough background to understand the helplessness of the human race. Even though the movie is filled with characters who you don't feel for, the ever present dread and suspense are enough to keep you tot the edge of your seat. One of the movies strengths is that it shows you just about enough to feel the anxiousness and the agony of the human race, but also leaves many questions unanswered, which makes it gritty and ominous. The acting is decent, but at times lacks inspiration. Scenes are shot decently and Forster knows how to push the story forward when necessary, while at other crucial times he slows down to stress a point. The ending is predictable, but that should not stop you from watching this movie.

I think of it more as a thriller than a horror type movie, sort of a race against time sort of thing. once you accept the fact that it is more of a thriller than a pure zombie gore film ( which I love by the way ) you will enjoy this movie. I would absolutely advise checking this out one time if you are a horror fan. A different spin on the zombie genre that i believe intelligent movie goers will find above average. Everyone is allowed to have an opinion, but some of these reviews are flat out horrible in terms of being able to convince the reader that this movie was sooo bad, without coming of like biased jerks. For that reason I always scan through a few pages of reviews to find intelligent takes on films if i am on the fence about a movie.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I went into the film with an open mind. I'm glad I did! With all the bad press this production got ( re-writes, re-shoots, the feud between brad Pitt and the director Marc Forster, etc) I thought this movie was doomed to fail! All that aside it really wasn't that bad of a film. Yes the zombies ran, and I hated that about the film. There was practically NO GORE what so ever! There are a few very intense moments. The action and camera work was decent. Other things were iffy for me too. But! They totally try to set this film up for a franchise, and if they do they can make a much better WWZ film. They can completely expand on what they've started. And make this a worthwhile franchise. One episode of The Walking Dead is much more violent, bloody, and more of a textbook zombie story. A story witch I Prefer! But all and all this was still an entertaining summer film! Once again the 3D was done in post conversion and was pretty pointless to see it in 3D. I saw it on the RPX screen witch is almost an IMAX screen so I had no choice but to see it in 3D.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Once bitten the victim becomes part of the horde within twelve seconds, not long for those you previously loved to get far enough away, as they become your next prey.The early sequence where Gerry attempts to protect his and another family within an apartment block is very effective and ramps up the tension as they all struggle to survive. The depiction of the inevitable break down in law and order, rapidly moving into ""every man for himself"", is both highly believable and highlights the thin veneer of civility we all accept and rely upon in our daily life.Of course Pitt is not just a normal Joe, in a previous life he moved through the hot spots of the world as a UN investigator and remains a key resource, worthy of saving to help the greater good, assuming of course he agrees to join the forces fighting back.The film is not so much about killing zombies, although the largely bloodless body count is high, the story instead focusing upon finding a cure to prevent a further spread of the disease. This is made clear as Gerry is tasked with assisting a young top virologist Dr Fassbach (Gabel) as he is sent to what is estimated to be ""ground zero"" to investigate.The film moves around the world, with a notable second act set in Jerusalem before reaching a climax in, rather bizarrely Cardiff, Wales UK. Rather than a welcome in the hill sides, just zombies, lots of zombies in white coats.The film is loosely based upon the book from Max Brooks and the film production was beset by rumours of cost overruns, re-shoots and ""creative differences"". In the Internet age, these terms are liberally attached to most big productions and despite initial reservations, the film has been successful with an ending leaving room for more, if audiences desire a re-match.The film deliberately shy's away from any outright gore, hard core horror fans should look elsewhere but this allows a much broader audience to enjoy a highly enjoyable thriller, that just happens to have Zombies as the main protagonist. There are ""jump"" scares a plenty but nothing your average 13 year old will not have seen before.Pitt plays the family man called to action with ease, equally at home with an axe in his had for making kindling or neutralising zombies as the situation demands. Enos (from the ""The Killing"" fame) makes a sympathetic ""stay at home mom, whilst husband is killing zombie hordes"" but arguably does not get enough to do. However, a note to self to always be careful when calling your partner during a zombie pandemic, as timing can be crucial.The effects and make up are state of the art, as you would expect on a production of this size. The final chapter works well but does appear to be spliced onto the action earlier, as if from a different film all together. This represents a much quieter and intimate man versus zombie, which could be due to the mentioned re-shoot, it does not harm the film but is a noticeable change of pace and setting.Summary Zombies lite, suitable for most family viewings with a good story, action sequences and effects.Highly enjoyable thriller with mild horror sequences that confounded pre-release critics, who clearly forgot the power of Zombie films to get up and keep going, even after being left for dead by their early reviews.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

At a time when there are a cluster of zombie movies with varying sub-genres, what makes this one unique is its treatment of the zombies as fast, aggressive and restless beings which are in your face whenever they are on screen. Boasting top notch special effects and massive action set pieces that sprawls the length and breadth of the globe, it is one heck of a thrill ride from start to finish. Having said that, it does have its share of misgivings - apart from Brad Pitt playing the central character with required intensity and vulnerability, rest of the characters as well as the depth of the plot leaves a lot to be desired.Gerry (Brad Pitt), an ex-United Nations staffer known for his thorough investigations is caught in the middle of a plague that breaks out worldwide which turns most of the humans into beasts. In an obligation to save his family comprising his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and 2 daughters, he joins the UN for a mission to identify the source of the plague. The clues and leads takes him on a journey across the world including Isreal, Europe etc, brushing past multiple close encounters. Can he find the cause, the cure and save his family in the process is what comprises the rest of the story.Though the movie leaves you gasping with terror and thrill through its superlative special effects, the emotional connect and the human element of the story hardly scrapes its potential. The point that the Zombies they are fighting were actually human beings like them before is hardly realized. For e.g., consider the Spanish couple who turn zombies before their son and tries to attack him. Mireille Enos neither brings enough depth required for the situation her character has been put in nor serves as the eye candy for a shallow viewing. The writers and the director didn't seem to have made up their mind on where to take this incredible journey they have started so competently and sadly left it with their brilliant special effects and action choreography team to fill in for their shortcomings. The background score is apt and does not waver too far from the glimpse shown in the trailer. The zombie make up is on par but doesn't break any new ground especially when TV shows like 'The Walking Dead' is doing such a brilliant job. The climax was not satisfactory enough for me though I generally don't mind the meta finishes.A must watch on the big screen but strictly a one time watch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Although this idea has been used several times before, I still left the theatre feeling quite impressed.I loved the novel. I went into the theatre today knowing full well that this movie was going to be nothing like the novel, which is probably part of why I ended up enjoying it so much.The acting was good. I could believe their terror and pain at the right moments. And the ""solution"" that they came up with not only made perfect sense, but was original when it comes to infection-epidemic films.I'm a little conflicted when it comes to the zombies themselves. The sounds they made were perfectly chilling. These undead fellows were a helluva lot faster and stronger than your typical zombie. They almost gave off a sort of ""I Am Legend"" vibe with the way they moved and attacked, even using the same techniques like using their head to smash through windshields and other car windows. I could see the idea behind them; they were supposed to be more vicious and intimidating than normal. But the scenes with thousands of them working together to climb the fortress walls and of them pouncing on victims in the beginning seemed too unbelievable because of the obvious CGI. It took me most of the movie to finally decide I liked these zombies; with their speed, strength, and fierce determination, they're absolutely terrifying. And they also seemed more like typical zombies when they turned dormant after running out of people to infect.I think what I liked most about this movie was the lack of bloody violence and vile language. That sounds really strange, but that's what is normally expected with a movie like this. I was impressed by how good this film was for being a zombie movie with almost no blood or gore. I also liked the pacing of the movie. It's very difficult to enjoy a movie when it is too fast-paced, and unbearable when too slow. This film had just the right mixture of both.World War Z is a good film about an everyday man fighting to ensure the safety of his family and eliminate the ultimate threat against humanity. It's suspenseful in some places and action-packed in others, and also pleasantly surprising. A good mixture for a good movie.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Honestly, historically speaking, gore has probably been more important to the zombie genre than story (which is incredibly weak in this movie, anyway). Pitt is terribly unconvincing as a stay-at-home dad that is secretly a badass (and apparently way smarter than the worldwide scientific community). If you genuinely like zombie movies, you will not like World War Z. If you like the book, you'll be disappointed by this movie. Apparently, Brad Pitt is going around saying he wanted this movie to be PG-13, so his kids could see it. That's absolutely untrue. This movie is PG-13, so they could make a profit. It had an incredibly high budget, and they needed it to be more accessible, as to recoup that money.

There's no ""trying to find a cure"" thread in the book at all, yet, that's what this whole movie was about?? No war scenes AT ALL?? I swear, I went home and double checked my book to see if maybe I had the wrong title or something...One star was generous, this was truly awful.","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

It's global war mixed with survival, gun-ho fights, local low-tech thrill ride, and cure hunting. You'd think that with such a mix, you'd get a mess, but no, Marc Forster pulled it off.The good. Almost everything. I'll just name the best parts. Very realistic approach, nothing is easy, and characters die. Extremely solid tension, your teeth might ache from all the jaw clenching you'll probably do. Very intense and well made action with eye-popping special effects. Lots of attention to details. A tight scenario that gives the ride of a lifetime. A riveting story that avoids a number of zombie clichés. Great score. Very attaching characters. Finally an American movie with a global event that gives more than just a passing nod to other nations.The actors. Brad Pitt offers us his action hero type with a coating of realism. The other solid performance, beside the two daughter (and to a lesser degree the wife), is given to us by Daniella Kertesz. The rest of the cast performed well, but nothing distinctive.The bad. The ""I need credentials before I talk to you"" is kind of a little bit much, but easily forgivable.The ugly. Nothing.The result. The best zombie movie ever. Also highly recommended to thrill seekers and action lovers.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

The film tackles themes of survival and the camaraderie of others in troubled times. It's a movie that feels very much like a big budget summer blockbuster, but it doesn't lack any depth. The director, Marc Forster, does a great job of creating tension and an ambiance where danger is lurking in every corner. There are some really nice slow points in the film, where we can feel for the characters and sympathize with their situation, that build towards a heart pounding action sequence. I really enjoy how this film sort of throws us into the fray instead of slowly building up to the threat. It really shows how fast this disease and threat is really spreading. This bumps up the tension and the stakes.The actors do a good job of bringing to life these interesting characters. Brad Pitt, while not his best performance, really makes Gerry into a relatable character. He's a family man that is well equipped with survival knowledge and tenderness to make others feel safe. Daniella Kertesz is a real standout as Segen. She plays a Israeli soldier that helps Gerry through his journey. She's strong, confident, and able to hold her own, while keeping Gerry safe. The rest of the cast is in the film for a short amount of time, but serve their roles well. Some characters can be unintentionally annoying, mainly Gerry's youngest daughter, but luckily they're not in it for very long. The zombies are extremely scary and dangerous. There make-up is well done and they're not like any other zombies that I've seen.Overall ""World War Z"" is an extremely entertaining and well made film. It is both fun, action packed, and well worth your time. The score is one of the best I've heard all year. It is epic, quiet when needed, and really puts us on the edge of our seats. It has interesting characters and a great story about survival with a goal that doesn't become some aimless expedition. I give it 4.5/5, a big budget summer movie that not only delivers on thrills, but also is packed with depth.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Some scenes were even very tense. And that's in a zombie movie! Never thought I'd say that. It's hard to make a believable zombie. This was a B movie made with an A movie amount of money. The special effects were fine. It did what a movie should do. It took my mind off everything else and just entertained. Maybe it was supposed to have some deeper meaning, but that's not why most people see movies, in my opinion. They want what this movie was.

The story is sold and the acting from all is phenomenal. I found this movie to make me jump. The suspense is almost killing and the ""zombies"" in this movie are different than any that I have ever seen. I ,being a zombie fanatic, am in love with the traditional zombies from the classics such as, night of the living dead and 28 days later, but i found that the ""Zombies"" in World War Z are very realistic to the situation given. I use the quotation marks around zombies when talking of this movie because it is never told only suggested and mentioned in the movie that these are actually zombies. Based upon my research and love for the undead creatures I would say that these are not Zombies due to how they act in the film. The creators do have a few aspects that resemble the undead by a few facts that are seen in as little as the previews shown on TV. The trailer shows the creators piling on top of each other to get to the top of a tall wall. This aspect shows the creators need to spread the disease and to not stop under any circumstance. Overall the movie is a new hit to spread the ""zombie"" liking to the world and show the impact a disease has on a nation and a world.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Max Brooks, author of both World War Z and The Zombie Survival Guide gathered inspiration from many different and credible sources, sources like the Centers For Disease Control, National Security Administration, Central Intelligence Agency, and even members of the United Nations committees on pandemic response. The feeling from both of the books as well as in interviews with Mr. Brooks has shown that what he found is we are all woefully less prepared for a pandemic of epic proportions then we think we are. Now I am not saying that we are going to need to fear the rising undead as they come for our tasty brains, but that the very REAL idea that is explored in both the book and movie is that this kind of emergency can go from a mild panic to a world wide epidemic. I think this movie was made for fans of the books and not for zombie lovers. It was made for people who loved the references to things like referring to the zombies as ""G's"" (short for ghouls) or ""Zak"". This film was made for people who love the suspense that comes with long quiet, and then a shock. This was a great exploration into what we might do to rise above all that may come, and a feeling of hope that we could survive anything even the raising of the dead.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Couple of scenes/elements cost the movie a couple of stars for me but would still highly recommend this.

The film gets moving very early on and we initially follow the Lane family as the zombie outbreak hits the City. From here Gerry Lane (Pitt)is reunited with the United Nations in an attempt to stop the outbreak and find a cure. We follow him to South Korea in a dark wet and eerie setting that has some very cool and intense moments. We then head to Jerusalem with an epic daytime Zombie attack which is one of the most intense things I have ever seen in a Zombie film, the pace is frenetic at times and while the plausibility may present a few issues, it is shot in a way that takes you right into the action an leaves you with little time to think. From there Gerry finds himself in Wales after a brilliant Zombies on a plane moment. The climax ends in a more sombre and intelligent way and while it does provide a nice Hollywood ending it does also provide a bitter sweet moment for the hero of the day. The film is highly entertaining and moves at a fast pace and provides scares and jumps as well as some great action scenes with just enough narrative and story to keep things moving along. The 3D in this film is not so great ( virtually non existent ) I'd recommend watching in 2D as some bits seemed harder to see in 3D ( for me anyway ). I will definitely be watching this again and will go into my top 5 zombie films based on the fact it does something new with the genre. 8/10 x","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The film isn't bad at all. I have seen various comments and reviews where people suggest it was a load of garbage and not worth watching... I would disagree. Yes, the story is fairly predictable and I guessed what the ending would be about 15 minutes before it happened, but the film delivers a very effective atmosphere which leaves you constantly with that 'suspenseful' feeling. During all the scenes where the zombies are attacking I constantly felt agitated and almost wanted to shout at the screen to tell the characters to run. The animation and movement of the infected is very well polished, and the way in which they sprint after you is really what creates the fear when watching this film. I don't think this movie is much about creating an interesting story, but more about showing off thrilling scenes of violence and scaring the viewers. This works well to an extent, and personally I loved it, but I can see why some people do have their negative views to this film. Overall the acting was great, there were no tedious parts and generally the film was alright. The one and only downside (as I've already said) is simply the story. Zombie films have been done too many times before, and I think the scope of new story ideas is very much minimal in this genre.I'd give this film a 7.8/10, although IMDb only lets me choose 8 as the closest figure.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I had concerns before seeing it since I read a lot of the articles about the hurdles. But what a payoff for us!I never imagined it to come across so visually enthralling as the way you (Brad) and everyone who worked on it over the last two years have been able to put up on the screen. I understand everyone has different tastes, but this is a dish I will be going for seconds on...more like twelve helpings (good countdown scene) ;)Hoping the best for this title!P.S. Marc Forster did a good job from what I saw. The shaky cam was less intense and this worked. So whatever happened I'm guessing is hearsay and similar to what almost everybody deals with at work. I don't envy that kind of pressure, but I'll gladly pay for another WWZ. Good job.Came across the original ending after seeing the movie, and man, is it dark, which dark would've been good for this genre, but maybe use it for the sequel. I think the sequel(s) will be more in line with the book: h t t p://www.movies.com/ movie-news/ world-war-z-original-ending/ 12638?wssac=164&wssaffid=newsThe Resident Evil movies don't hold a candle to this, but the endings are always big.

Due to it's high cost,I decided to take a look. Ya,it didn't disappointed me,as the scene of the end of world is perfect. Chaos,complete destruction...etc,which explain it's high cost. Most of all,abundance of zombies running is really really frightened and excited. Due to it's ending,many remarks have criticized this film harshly. For sure,I was a little bit disappointed at the end of the film,but if we inspect the film thoroughly,you would realize that this ending was not that bad. The end of the world is easy for film to start it,but to end it is hard. For human,if our world really suffered the disease like this,as the film,we might find the solution,but to restore the world should take hundreds of years. Therefore,for the film,it is really hard to use the rest of few minutes to end the story,few minutes is difficult to represent hundreds of years. If you try to feel the movie like this,you would eventually consider World War Z to be a nice film. Undoubtedly,it's high cost is really worth a ticket. Take a look,my friends. Thank you for reading my idea,I would be grateful if you try to discuss more about the film with me.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Max Brooks' hugely successful novel was put through the proverbial wringer on it's road to the big screen. Numerous script re-writes, many scenes re-shot, a re-worked third act, an all new ending, and a 6 month delay in release date. The final product is something that fans of TV's ""The Walking Dead"" will probably appreciate and many others will find it entertaining enough.Brad Pitt gives an earnest effort as a former United Nations investigator who now enjoys his new role as house-husband. In fact, director Marc Foster (Quantum of Solace, Monster's Ball) zaps us with the first zombie action just after Pitt serves up pancakes to his two daughters and wife Karin (Mireille Enos, ""The Killing""). It turns out Pitt is more than just an expert at flapjacks. His expertise is needed in this global zombie crisis brought on by a virus ...or bacteria, that started in India ... or Israel ... or Asia. See, those details don't really matter because the infection has spread to every corner of the globe.I actually enjoyed Pitt more in the ""quiet"" moments than in the big CGI action sequences. He is quite believable as a doting husband and father, less so as the world's savior. Still, the issues with this movie are not on Mr. Pitt. Four writers (in addition to the novelist) rarely deliver a coherent script' however, since it's an apocalyptic zombie thriller, they almost get away with it! If you haven't visited the zombie genre in a few decades, be prepared ... these aren't the sluggish zombies made famous by George Romero. Instead, these are blazingly fast and able to leap tall buildings, flying helicopters ... and the great wall of Jerusalem. Yes, Jerusalem. In one of the more unusual movie features, this one plays like ""Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?"". Pitt globe trots more than James Bond or Jason Bourne.For many, the zombie sequences and global apocalyptic theme will provide sufficient cinematic entertainment. For the rest of us, it's fine, but will forgotten as quickly as I am Legend.","16 out of 36 found this helpful.

When headlines broke that extensive re-shoots would cause it to be delayed six months, I lost almost all faith. I found myself suckered into seeing it, and I now have no regrets. It wasn't nearly the best film of the year, but it was enjoyable. Following Brad Pitt's portrayal of Gerry Lane was a thrill, as the supporting cast of humans and zombies alike created a tense atmosphere in every new location that was explored. The acting was fine, although I'm still unsure why Matthew Fox was even in the film. Truthfully, Gerry's wife didn't have much of an impact on the film either. Brad Pitt was the obviously the star, but the zombies were a close second. Their speed and strength reminded me of the infected people in 28 Days Later, another ""zombie"" movie I recommend. Whenever you can throw together a nice amount of suspense, solid acting, and intimidating zombies, your recipe is a success. 8/10","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

This does not mean it is bad. No sir, no. In fact the lack of gore compliments this film, adding an air of realism, allowing the film t focus on a meaningful plot.I've read a lot of negative reviews for this film & all I have to say to those negative reviewers is 'Stop being so nit picky! You have no actual cases to support your view! Stop complaining about it not being gory! This is not the Walking Dead! Its meant to be about plot not gore!' Moving past my rant this movie has excellent cinematography & some superb acting from Brad Pitt. I only have three issues with this movie & two of them are minor. For one I was a little bit disappointed at the movie's soundtrack (it was not as exhilarating & dramatic as portrayed in the trailers). My second issue was the with the zombies (another audio issue); the noises they made were to un-human in that they didn't sound like any noise a human could or would make (even if they were dead). My only major issue with World War Z is that it is nothing like the book; it doesn't use any characters or vents from the book, which I can overlook considering that I find the movie much better than the book.As a screen adaption of the book by Max Brooks World War Z is meh but as a movie it is immersive, well acted, well scripted, well filmed & well written. In all honesty you cannot compare World War Z the movie, to World War Z the book, as they are two very different peaces of literature, each with it's own merits.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

As the rating would suggest it is not your typical gory zombie romp but it makes up for this with fast paced action and a fair bit of tension. There are always going to be critics of this film, as the lack of brutal horror and gore will put some people off. I understand this but there is room in the market for a different take on the usual themes and this provides it. In keeping with modern Zombie films the zombies themselves are fast, very fast and seem to have more intelligence than normal. This leads to a number of tense and impressive long range visual scenes. The acting is solid and the story fast paced if a little far fetched. However if you are going to pick holes in Zombie film then you really are watching the wrong genre. Brad Pitt is a good actor and he does a good job of injecting some charisma into his role. I must admit I do prefer more brutal zombie films like Dawn of the Dead and 28 weeks later but I found this an entertaining film with plenty to recommend it. Worth watching especially if you find yourself in the older age bracket.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The exception is when the movie is suppose to be a comedy or comedic.WW Z caught me completely by surprise and kept me interested from credits to credits. Also, unlike other Z movies the focus was not just about victims being devoured and intestines being munched on. Rather, people were basically being ""recruited"" into the Z ranks at a fairly rapid pace. The globe-trotting added a layer of depth that was totally unexpected as typical Z movies are filmed in one home or town. I did not read the book. Thus my expectations were a blank slate.Also, the Z actors deserve major kudos for twisting and contorting their bodies into the scary creatures.

But World War Z was just bad on all fronts, and every aspect of what makes a good story/film was lacking in his film.The best part of the film was the opening credits. It featured a collage of news broadcasts, and images of ecological disasters. After the credits, we get nothing but action...which is entirely computer generated. Brad Pitt plays a UN delegate tasked with finding the cure to what is automatically deemed ""a virus"" And that basically sums up the plot. There was no human element in this movie, unlike the book, which had some integrity compared to this mess of a film. In this movie, there is no reminder of what it means to be human, and what it takes to survive as a group. All the things that made shows like the Walking Dead great.If you're an action fan, then go see this. You might like the spectacular action, which in my mind, was just comical. There is no gore in the film, so stay away zombie fans. This is not a zombie film at all, the zombies were all CG, there was no gruesome make up effects, there is no explanation of what the virus did the brain, no explanation of how Brad Pitt found out about the cure....other than super intuition. It's downright silly. Never in my life was there a time when I went to a theater and found more people laughing at a zombie film before. If you want to see a great zombie film, watch 28 Days Later or the more recent ""Warm Bodies""","17 out of 39 found this helpful.

Earlier in 2013, we had Warm Bodies and there have also been television shows focusing on the undead, such as the fantastic TV series, the Walking Dead. I dreaded this movie because like any other Internet user, I paid attention to the production problems this film encountered. It is much better than I thought and is action-packed and even though it's relatively bloodless, we have ourselves a giant action spectacle. While we associate zombies with being slow, this film had them moving at high speeds and I think that was a neat twist in the tiring zombie genre.Marc Forster's film is about a U.N specialist named Gerry Lane who survives the original zombie pandemic along with his family. Now that he is safe, he must go on a race against time to find a cure and keep his family safe.The acting in the film is actually really good. But that's not surprising with Brad Pitt in the lead who constantly proves that he is a diverse actor. While a tad short on character development, Brad Pitt certainly leads the way as he finds himself in the midst of all the action.Overall, World War Z is a rather different take on zombies and the film feels fresher that way. It's a bit uneven at times, but there is just way too many things to like about this film. The special effects are really good and though some people question them, I think it takes some time to get used to, especially with me being a Walking Dead fanatic. Despite the troubled production, this film is highly entertaining and I hope there is a sequel down the line. I rate this film 9/10.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's still a mystery and also I'm looking forward to see what will happen in the second series.Overall, I'd say this Zombie movie is nice to be watched. ;)","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It is absolutely horrific.The only movie I can think of that comes close to this in terms of inaccuracies to the source material is The Running Man, and at least that was entertaining. Don't waste your time with this film. I have no idea how the rating is as high as it is.Shame on Paramount for getting the rights to this and then flushing it down the toilet.

It's also set on a global scale, with several countries being featured in the film. All of a sudden, the world is a very unsafe and unpredictable place. Good luck.

This movie show another side of the Pitt as he is a family guy now and unlike Fight Club and Troy he is more of a family guy and is motivated by family.The movie has a logical conclusion which you will hardly find in any fictional movie. The supporting actors have also performed very well.The movie also highlight the important aspect of our lives that we are very much prepared to fight each other but we are not at all prepared to fight the other forces and disasters.

After 5 minutes after we meet the characters the action starts. By now I don't even know the name of any of them, and I couldn't care if any of them died. Sadly we are in the beginning introduced to a very interesting character, but sadly he is killed off as the moment we start to like him. Many scenes drag on for way too long, and I found the movie more comical than scary. Me and many others in the cinema laughed of how silly and stupid the ""zombies"" acted. Also many of the scenes drag on way too long and you start to wonder what the director was thinking. The ending is one of the worst ending of any movie I have ever seen.

The director, Marc Forster, although known for directing mainly drama films, does a really good job. He gives us a very straight lined, fast paced and relentless film. It takes you around the world tracking the source of the pandemic, while zombie hordes bring chaos everywhere. That twinge we feel in our gut isn't nausea but tension, which is rare. The most expensive zombie flick ever made, it follows Brad Pitt as former UN investigator Gerry Lance who travels to North Korea, Israel , Newark and anywhere else where ever the source of this mysterious carnage seems to have its origin. Initially reluctant to leave his family and go on this mission, and having witness this outbreak first hand as the virus hit Philadelphia, he relents and accepts the proposal from the government for his family's safety. His travel to zombie hot-spots for the same gives us a vivid image of the undead, how they turn and mutate, and even co-operate in attacking humans. We have fast paced, thrilling chases from the hero's point of view and also broad glimpses of destruction from a security camera or a helicopter. Brad Pitt, as expected, delivers a superb performance, doing justice to the role of Gerry Lance. Overall, World War Z presents an abundance of relatively plausible action, smart solutions and useful lessons for the apocalypse.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Therefore, my entire review is ignorant to any source material and is judging the movie as a stand alone film. As far as that goes, I thought this was one of the best zombie films ever made. Yes, it is plagued by the same exaggerations all zombie films suffer from. However, World War Z is actually a genuinely good movie, zombie nonsense aside. The acting, led by Brad Pitt, is fantastic and the plot develops well. The intensity in the movie starts up right away so there's no lag time to deal with while they develop the setting. The setting is already familiar... it's America today. The discovery of the zombie outbreak is part of the joy in watching the film and the initial sequence where you're first introduced to the situation is one of the most intense segments in recent memory. The action itself feels very realistic, aside from the aforementioned exaggerations that is. Pitt isn't made out to be some superhero or anything so he feel real too. The only real flaws for me were the exaggerations and that the ending felt like it was rushed. The entire two hours builds to this culmination that just ends right away and doesn't give you much closure. I suppose they were going for that with how they set the scene in the closing moments but from a viewer's perspective, I would've liked it a bit differently. Overall though, this is a great movie that most people will almost certainly enjoy.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I myself am a die-hard fan of Max Brooks' original book, but I still loved the movie.It wasn't a George A. Romero film, and it wasn't ""The Walking Dead."" (And it certainly wasn't the book.) But  that's just fine, in my opinion. It was different. It was a bangin', epic, global monster war movie with some amazing action set pieces. I think the siege of the walled Jerusalem (a subplot that actually WAS from the book), was alone well worth the price of a ticket. Not every zombie movie has to have the same tone and narrative as Romero's work or Robert Kirkman's work. Arnold Schwarzenegger's recent ""Maggie"" film showed us, for example, that very different zombie movies can still be incredibly good.My only real criticism of the movie was that its plot resolution seemed  pretty damned risky. Isn't there a pretty obvious danger connected with the defense employed by Pitt's character? Maybe I missed something.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Unfortunately its also short in superfast edits and shaky hand held style, which , combined with the many dark scenes make it hard to watch. I pity those who paid to see it in 3d as that must have made it worse.Brad Pitt starred and produced this and needless to say he is the hero and the only one who gets anything to do. The script is utterly stupid and Pitt gives a performance that seems to alternate between looking constipated and bored. If you must see it in cinemas don't waste your money in 3d.

Unfortunately they got Damon Lindelof to rewrite the movie and needless to say its a mess. The actual "" resolution"" (the movie isn't resolved but the solution they find is as near as they are going to get) is utterly imbecilic. It makes no sense in any way shape or form.Not that the film doesn't have problems from the start. Mark Foster's super fast cuts and shaky cam make what could have been interesting action sequences unwatchable. Pitt is totally unconvincing as an intellectual type and he looks bored at times.No cliché is left unused, there is no blood. Its a Disney zombie movie.I'm not a gorehound but you'd expect some.The characters take turns in behaving stupidly. Its not involving 75% of the time and there are ""what the heck"" moments of idiocy so regularly that they took me out of the movie.","21 out of 51 found this helpful.

Pretty boy Brad Pitt was in it, but other than that, I thought it was one of the best movies of the year. Definitely the best graphics for a zombie movie ever.The movie is 2 hours, which I think more movies should be now a days. The scope of how big budget the movie was, mixed with the fact that it has just as good a story as the best zombie movies ever, was what makes this worth seeing. Seeing entire cities being burned and overrun by hordes of zombies, has never actually looked convincing. All other attempts at this scenery pale in comparison.I really like Zombie movies, and vampire movies, and sci fi and such. As long as they are really good (examples off the top of my head: Bram Stoker's Dracula, Elysium, Minority Report, Alien series, Dusk Til Dawn). This is right up there with those movies.I honestly believe this movie will creep up in acceptance over a few years, unfortunately. People will have trouble opening up to it, but over time, they will give it a chance and see how great it is.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I had gone back and forth on rather or not I would see it during the past few weeks. At first, I was going to see it as I like zombie films and this was one with a huge budget. However, the fact it starred Brad Pitt made me iffy (not a big Brad Pitt fan). Then I saw some trailers and I was a bit more excited, until I saw the film was rated PG-13. At that point it was a no go as I just thought a zombie film should be R. After seeing several people on Facebook say they enjoyed the film I decided I would see it and it turned out to be a rather good zombie film. Granted, I still say it would have been better rated R as I could tell by the editing that there will be an unrated DVD version.The story has a man and his family having breakfast and going about their daily routine. My thinking at this point was that the film was going to take a while to get going. However, the family is not in the car for too long before explosions begin to occur within the city and people are fleeing in a panic. Finally, people begin attacking other people and the zombie outbreak has begun! It is up to Gerry (Pitt's character) to help a man try to discover what is the source of this horrid outbreak, however things do not proceed as planned. Gerry goes to South Korea, Israel and what I believe was Germany in the hopes of finding a source of the outbreak or at least some way to combat it.The effects are pretty good, once again I think they should have just released the film with an R rating. My guess is though with such a huge budget they decided that they needed as many people as possible going so that is why they ended up demanding cutting the film so it would be PG-13. Pitt does okay and the movie as a whole does a great job creating tension. For the next couple of weeks, every time I hear a door slam or something squeak I will remember this film. The film had more action than I was led to believe it was going to have, but I do have to say the scenes in Israel are the best as the zombies find very creative ways to get to their prey! So I did enjoy this film a good deal. It was nice to see something at the movies that was not a sequel or remake. The film throws you into the action quickly as it does not linger long on Gerry's home life. Near the end it turns almost into a stealth movie as there is a lot of sneaking around. It ends in a way that suggests there could be a sequel at a later date as things are far from resolved. If so, I will probably see it as well.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

This film succeeds where so many zombie films in the past have failed. This film for once, was not a typical rehash of a group of people trying to hold up and survive a zombie apocalypse. This was an excellent story, it was so well written. Yes, its PG13 and you die hard zombie fans out there would love to see people's face get ripped off and ate, or guts being torn out from victims. Lets face it people that is a bunch of bs, you don't have to show people getting eaten alive and ripped apart for it to be a zombie film. This film was extremely intense throughout, there were very little moments where you weren't cringing on the edge of your seat; or do what I do during intense films covering one of my ears with my fingers as I am trying to watch the film but look down towards the floor just to anticipate a flinch moment. I loved this film so much, because it was extremely realistic it was not some lame explanation on how zombies became infected. This was not a movie where zombies mysteriously just rise from their graves and start attacking people, no mystery toxin gas or goo, or some random unexplained zombie deciding to attack people. I loved how this was written, this is truly the contagion of zombie movies. I have a deep respect for the classic zombie films and George Romero the godfather of all zombie films, those were great and helped pave the way for generations to come. This however, is the most realistic, superbly written zombie film to ever come out. My favorite and greatest zombie film in my opinion is 28 Weeks Later, but this film is frightening because of how realistic it is. I was scared, because instead of zombies wanting brains it was legions of infected simply wanting to spread their disease like a virus which is so much more believable. Brad Pitt was phenomenal in this film, he was an excellent actor. Seriously, go out and watch this and be forewarned to not bite your nails or engage in your nervous ticks, because this will have you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie. The soundtrack was also excellent, it made the film a lot more intense. It got insane, but still remained suspenseful and realistic. I appraise this film, because it was a zombie movie and yet it wasn't full of gore. Which is amazing, this film just proved to Hollywood and broke the molds of proving to everyone that a zombie film can still be a zombie film without the gore.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The 50s version of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" was a whole lot scarier and John Carpenter's 1982 remake of ""The Thing"" had more innovative effects for the time.I actually liked ""Warm Bodies"" better because it at least had a plot and a story line that wasn't simply an amalgamation of every zombie movie ever made (only with swarming fast zombies replacing the plodding ones).I rented this dog on Pay-per-View and spent an extra dollar for the HD version.

I've seen them all and typical of genre aficionados I nit pick them to death. There really isn't much to nitpick about this one. The acting is great, characters believable, and things are visually pleasing, it's really not gory at all, and the plot is smart and makes sense. The movie is unique in that it's quite believable. For example, it doesn't have the typical zombie pitfalls of not explaining common sense things, like, why people getting splashed by blood aren't being infected. Not saying holes can't be poked in some of the science, as much as one can expect from a zombie movie, however, it made sense.

The movie contained a plot too simple to fill a CSI episode, inane dialog, and totally wooden acting. There were many plot features that were simply ridiculous. There were all these sailors on navy ships doing there jobs with absolutely no concerns about their families but for some reason it was critical to EVERYONE to keep Brad Pitts' wife and children safe. The other officials and sailors had no contact with their families, but it was deemed critical to make sure that Brad Pitt got to talk to his wife every day. Everyone on board a large jetliner EXCEPT Brad Pitt and his accomplice and the 2 pilots gets turned into a zombie and then the plane crashes, supposedly on final approach to an airport even though there is no sign of civilization anywhere around, and everyone and everything gets killed EXCEPT, of course, for Brad Pitt and his accomplice.

Will he find a cure to protect people from the zombies? That is the story. Not important really, because action and suspense is everything in World War Z and it is done brilliantly.Seen it once and I thought it was a very energetic and impressive zombieflick, but it felt like a formula film. Saw it a second time and was amazed how much I still loved the frenzy of this thriller. Then saw it a third, fourth...10th time and it has become my favorite zombie movie now and the frenzy like energy of this movie is to thank for that. It is truly a rollercoaster of actionscene upon actionscene. Very impressive adrenaline rush. Works better than coffee or redbull. You probably wont wanna go to bed at all after seeing this...What is particularly good about World War Z is that it comes close to a real life scenario in which people turn into zombies. I know this may sound stupid, but most zombie movies are so far removed from any reality that this movie really is a breather. Besides the zombies, anything else in this movie is portrayed very realistically, which makes the feverish longing to escape from the zombies even more intense.Brad Pitt has to protect his own family in the first place and the acting he does is very heartfelt. You want Brad's family to survive, you almost want to warn them when there is another zombie lurking around the corner. And regardless of how many times I have seen it, this movie reaches my gut and heart everytime. That is a good sign.World War Z really has everything to become a classic, because it gave the most chilling realistic portrayal of zombies ever done before. Really cant find any fault with this movie. Acting, photography, soundtrack, everything is just perfect. World War Z is the new standard for the ultimate zombie movie as far as I am concerned. A must see if you are into zombie movies. And a must see if you are into action movies. World War Z is a beast!Special mention to director Marc Foster who is NOT an action movie director at all. Besides 1 James Bond movie he hasnt made any action packed movies. On the contrary all of his movies are mostly shown in the arthouse filmtheatres. Check out: ""Stranger than fiction"" (weird but original comedy), ""Monster's Ball"" (racial drama).Maybe it is because of his background in mainly arthouse films that this zombie film rose beyond all the other ones...A sequel with Brad Pitt is planned for 2020...","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

IT WAS TERRIBLE!!! Read the book and go see something else. Don't like reading? Get the World War Z audio book and listen to it in your car! This was such a typical Hollywood junk move: buy the rights to something that was awesome and turn it into a steaming pile of over-hyped garbage.Max Brooks, the author of Zombie Survival guide and World War Z, went out of his way in these books to undo the damage done by low grade zombie movies and give credibility to a zombie outbreak. The zombie moved in a predictable slow rate, they were defeated by faster, more agile living, they were truly undead due to a virus that transforms the front of the brain to an anaerobic organism. The advantage they had was simply their numbers, being able to infect new hosts and their undead stamina.The movie had ""fast zombies"" who ran and bounced around like a glittering vampire from Twilight. The movie had NO resemblance to the memoir style the book or the events that took place within. The guy who is supposed to be an interviewer/narrator is instead cast as the most ""Joe Bad-ass"" journalist I've ever seen (Brad Pitt) and he saves the world. Good thing he has Jesus hair, because he went all sorts of savior on this one.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Initially adapted in 2008 by sci-fi and comic book scribe J. Michael Straczynski, the screenplay went through a complete overhaul by Matthew Michael Carnahan, whose debut film, The Kingdom, delivered the kind of politically-infused action Paramount Studios and Pitt's production company, Plan B, were looking for.FOR THE REST OF THE REVIEW, PLEASE GO TO: http://tuffgnarl.com/world-war-z-review/","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

World War Z isn't your typical run of the mill, ""let's scare the moviegoers with gruesome"" zombie flick not with the occasional news feed about some type of disease (like N1H1 or H7N9) potentially having the ability to cause a world wide pandemic. No, this movie offers what this reviewer perceives a likely and yet plausible scenario of what could happen today ...tomorrow or near future if a disease - viral or bacterial, that was so powerful it could create widespread of living dead after being bitten. Based on the book by Max Brooks, World War Z stars Brad Pitt as the ""hero"" Gerry Lane who must race against time and odds to find the answers in solving on how to stop this fast acting, world wide pandemic before the human race is no more. His character nearly throughout this movie faces one dangerous obstacle after another without trying to be some zombie's next victim in the process while traveling the world in search of clues and a possible solution to end it. The solution in the end may not be perfect or solid however it does give the surviving non-dead humans a chance to live and fight another day against the living dead. It's almost the absolute reality we have to face especially within a like World War Z ...that not every solution to a problem like this will be perfect.The zombies in this movie aren't your usual slow moving ""brain hungry"" kind in this movie. They are fast acting and can easily sniff out a healthy human in seconds. This reviewer while watching this movie was in total awe on how fast zombies could attack a city (for example Jerusalem, Israel) in minutes. This should give you some idea the urgency in why Brad Pitt's character needed to find a solution to counterattack whatever was causing the world wide spread of zombie attacks even though it was never truly establish if this was ""zombie"" or simply people being infected by a viral or bacterial disease. One thing is for certain the reality of something like World War Z ever happening is horrifyingly scary.On a special note, this reviewer can see where the English alternative band, Muse, got their inspiration for the latest release 2nd Law with songs like 2nd Law: Isolated System and Follow Me to be included in the movie. She could have seen others such as Panic Station (at the beginning of the movie when New York is overrun by ""zombies""), Survival (towards the end of the movie) or 2nd Law:Unsustainable added to the movie soundtrack along with Marco Beltrami's original scores to further heighten how devastating a World War Z scenario could be.Your best bet for curbing a potential ""zombie"" pandemic attack is hoping it doesn't actually happen...","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

This is not a Romero-style horror movie, and those looking for that will be disappointed (as can be seen in some of the reviews here). Zombies do not shamble, but rather run pell-mell at anything that moves. They are terrifying in their heedless determination, stampeding down a street or flinging themselves off a roof in an attempt to reach a helicopter.The story is minimal, and is essentially just a delivery system for a series of elaborate set pieces, but the scenes of chaotic violence are utterly compelling, and what story there is is effective, as is a good, low key performance from Brad Pitt.If you're looking for a horror movie full of gore and dark passageways, this may not be the zombie movie for you, but if you want something truly thrilling (far more so than the overrated 28 Days Later) then this is an excellent choice.Also, if you're looking for an adaptation of the World War Z book, this isn't it; a real adaptation would be more like a Ken Burns documentary. While both the book and movie are incredibly entertaining, they are so radically different that comparing them doesn't even make sense.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I already suspected it was a flop from its trailers so i didn't really expect much. And just like i thought it was a very expensively produced train- wreak of a movie. Imagine watching resident evil, dawn of the dead, the walking dead or any other decent zombie movie/show.. then lets say there was no gore or cannibalism allowed,or even close up bullet shots to the brain, basically nothing remotely violent on screen even tho the story sounds violent. It has a few pop-up scare parts and a few parts where it seemed something could happen cool but a quick scene change makes sure we cant see whats going on fully. Like when they have to cut the army girls hand/arm off the camera pans up so nothing is shown spraying out of it or the guy that hears a zombie turns to run and shoots himself in the head(i must take there word for it cant see it). Any death in this movie happens so quick and is blocked so much because of the rating it hard to know who really died and who might have escaped a close call. The young boy who runs away from the apartment building with them in the heli is never seen after unless i missed something. One of the biggest flaws of the film is the locations they picked.. to most they might think well i liked the exotic scenery but from the trailer it looked like it stayed in a US city mostly(where it would be most exciting), if i had read the book before i saw it i might have understood the location changes better or at least expected it. Also the story goes on to say the US falls first because we didn't have enough guns/ammo... really?... just face palm. I think they really wanted to stay out of the US for filming since its to expensive really besides the books plot. Overall i don't think this is a worthy zombie movie given its budget and actors.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

The plot was the same, if not worse, than any other zombie film. It's not your 2013 version of Night Of The Living Dead haha. But it is a good time killer, so if you're bored go see it! Just don't be disappointed when it's over and it doesn't live up to your expectations.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

Brad Pitt, who also stars, produced the film through his Plan B entertainment company which also bought the rights to the film the novel.After the purchase, it was reported the source material would be lightly used since filming the book as written wouldn't work not too mention drive the production budget into the hundreds of millions of dollars. Fast forward years later, the film still wasn't on its way to being green light because the budget was reported at $125,000,000, which makes WWZ the most expensive zombie film ever made. Once Brad agreed to join the cast, Paramount put the cash and director Marc Forster was announced to helm... I can't speak for everyone, but I knew this would be a disaster, Marc Forster, who directed Quantum of Solace, arguably one of the worst bond films ever made, was now directing his 10th film, and out of his resume only Monster's Ball was enjoyable. I equate him to John Moore, who has about the same track record in his resume.Filming begins in Scotland, and suddenly reports of blown shots, and other production issues begin filling out the horror news feeds, not too mention leaked footage taken BTS showing running zombies which make the DOTD remake zombies look slow, and top it with a release date change from 12/21/2012 to June 21, 2013 doesn't bode well for the production and we learn why in a bit. Still there may be hope, until the 1st trailer hits and the amount of CGI was just WOW. Fast Forward, April 2013, Vanity Fair releases a news article noting the films writer admitting the film is a mess, and needed some $70 million dollars worth of re-shoots because the ending of the film doesn't make sense. Now the bad JuJu vibes begin plaguing the thoughts of zombie fans world wide.Additional trailers being released doesn't seem to sway opinion that much, so opening weekend forecasts for box office began starting in the $35,000,000 range which is not good for a $200,000,000 zombie film. Now with $200 mil on the line, Paramount opts for the PG-13 route, to hopefully recoup the budget spent on the film, of course outrage ensues among fans of the book who are ticked source material is gravely ignored, and the fact PG-13 pretty much lets us know gore, if any would be minimal at best.Advance screenings begin and word of mouth begins to shift, WWZ is good... WHAT, internet fan boys the world over are crapping kittens that people are saying WWZ is enjoyable... are they right?Well, Yes and no. WWZ has its issues, CGI being the primary. However, it definitely went out of left field with the creation of a vaccine to make humans, food for our zombies, be non desirable to the zombies. I thought, hey, this is a cool angle, but also because of the non-gore, you now have zombies who can sense things about the humans, which is all new to the zombie lore we're all accustomed too as fans. I enjoyed how they used the Harvard scientist to tell us Mother Nature wants to get caught, as she leave bread crumbs on how to defeat her, we just have to be very observant. This was brilliant, especially as it is being said to our lead Gerry (Brad Pitt) who is a retired UN investigator who had keen skills for finding the source of outbreaks because of his observational skills as an investigator. Once these words are uttered you start to see the process in which Gerry thinks and acts in motion, it is hinted at once the outbreak begin in Philadelphia, and almost takes Gerry and his family from us, he watches as zombies attack and turn others and the rate at which they turn is about 10 seconds, which makes this virus more align with Rage from 28 days later, but all health and military folks tell us they are dead people. So it is not a race to save and convert the infected, it is a race to save the remaining humans. When Gerry explains the theory to surviving members of the W H O, they are at first taken back, but once put into a situation where our hero has to be the guinea pig, we learn so much more about how the zombie plague works.Because of these new items introduced into zombie lore, WWZ doesn't feel like the typical zombie films we have watched and enjoyed over the years thanks However, WWZ can't get all praise, the fact zombies only bite someone to infect them leaves us feeling cheated. What we have here is an amped up remake the recent remake of the crazies with a semi-zombie angle as opposed to a tried and true zombie film. Add to it the Brad Pitt family angle is only there to force him out of retirement when the military says either help us or find your own refuge.So we get typical clichés with a mix of something new that helps WWZ become a better film than it should be as a whole. I walked in with Extremely low expectations, but came out thinking, WOW, something new a different, it has flaws but works.I would definitely say WWZ is worth a solid B+ or A--, but until I can see the Blu-Ray in my home and catch whatever I missed in my drive-in experience... my rating stands firm at B+ for now.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

It's easy for me to put my brain on pause when watching zombie flicks. I pretty much love them all. I'm not picky. Throw in a few great actors and high dollar budget, and I'm in hog heaven.As far as WWZ goes, this is a quality movie. Good acting. Good characters. High quality cinema. It will most definitely not appeal to everyone. Some will complain about camera shake (valid). Others will say that it moved too fast (valid). Still many will tell you that it was too far off from the book (valid), it's too improbable (valid), the zombies weren't as cool as other zombies (valid), valid, valid and valid. They are all right. But if you are like me, IT'S A FREAKING ZOMBIE MOVIE - and a pretty good one at that. Just be glad Hollywood put a ton of money into something like this and gave us something good to look at.There will be better movies of this genre in the future to be sure.

The outbreak of an epidemic, an apocalyptic scenario, people running and hiding (the scary parts) and the protagonists searching for a solution; this would be a bird's eye view of the movie, as such a stereotype, but for me it was the details that did the trick, the plot had a certain realism to it (kind of like a serious version of Zombieland) and the execution and acting is good, enough to engage and even make one eager for a sequel.To elaborate, instead of a horde of zombies always chasing people around, there was some sense to the way things played out, how everyday behaviour could become a mistake and a cause of death (like a ringing cellphone when you are hiding from zombies who are sensitive primarily to noise) and how the fortification that kept a city safe could also turn it into a hell-hole. Even the temporary solution to curb the spread seemed sensible also it seemed reasonable that people were given priority (for safe harbour) not on the basis of rank and power but their usefulness in dealing with the situation. The protagonist wasn't a 'live on the edge', 'save all' hero but had practical reasons to risk his life (each time).The acting was good if not stellar (I felt Pitt was too much like Keanu Reeves) and the visual effects were good but not the best. On the whole I found it entertaining and worth the time, a serious (almost) no nonsense thrill ride.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"1","/10","Pitt ""Acting"" On Very Bad Advice","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2827788/?ref_=tt_urv","A_Different_Drummer","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44112735/?ref_=tt_urv","8 July 2013","Looking at World War Z (which ultimately this review will urge you NOT to do) you have to wonder if Brad Pitt was the recipient of a lot of really bad advice? First, and perhaps most astonishing, this is his baby. He is listed as producer. Maybe the advice went something like, ""Brad sweetie, Do what Tom Cruise did. DonÕt wait til Hollywood remembers you and sends you a good script. Get your own script and run the production yourself. Like Tom did with ""Jack Reacher."" Good advice on the surface, until you realize that Cruise not only purchased the rights to the Reacher series (""the"" top selling action fiction today) but decided to cast himself in the lead -- even though the physical dimensions of Reacher, as written by the series' author, Lee Child, compared to Cruise himself, bring to mind the finale in JACK THE GIANT SLAYER.The advice-giver also forgot to mention to Brad that JACK REACHER was a box office flop. Oops.We can also imagine that the very same advice-giver might have mentioned that, late in his career, Paul Newman used to play against type (""his"" type, defined in dozens of films) and did so successfully. Here in World War Z Pitt also plays against type, and does so to a fault -- many critics have lamented that, if you didn't see the Pitt name on the credits, you would have no idea you were watching a mega-star.Oops again.One good thing about film (aside from the fact that watching it is fully optional, no one is going to FORCE you to see it) is that the first 20 minutes probably set a record for non-stop action. Not sure this is a good thing? Several times I actually WANTED THE ACTION TO STOP so I could figure out what I was seeing, but that clearly was not the intention of the director.The ending is odd, and discussed elsewhere. Google it.All in all, the perfect film to see if the day ever comes when zombies are actually taking over the world, the gas stations are out, the ATMS are broken, and you only have 2 hours left to live anyway.","15 out of 35 found this helpful.

One senses a certain fatigue with the Undead trope- movies dating back to the 60s and a popular TV series. Granted, this one doesn't follow the book, there were deleted scenes and (apparently) numerous rewrites during production but the final product stands on its own and merits a sequel. Judge it as a stand alone.Pitt contributes a solid performance minus the customary superhero excesses and Daniella Kertesz, as the wounded Israeli soldier, comes off as courageous yet heartbreakingly vulnerable.There's little gore and the CGI effects and set pieces, for example the scenes within the walled off city of Jerusalem, are stunning. The Zombies inspire genuine fright. Unlike the shuffling ghouls in Walking Dead, for example, these guys go for your throat sprinting.I read Brook's novel and appreciated the sophisticated geopolitical take. But, let's be honest, the fact that it consists essentially of vignettes and post facto interviews with survivors of Z encounters renders it less than ideal for film treatment.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Most heroes today are violent killers. He also had some pull with his status in the health/government but got no special treatment overall, which made him a normal guy with some status as much middle to high class Americans that have been in school and are intelligent. The movie was scary yet not gory as these type of movie tends to be. In conclusion a good enjoyable movie that needed not to go to the bloody violent ends to get the audience attention.

Take a monster well known to be at home in the horror genre and put it in a summer blockbuster. Well I'll be damned, it actually worked pretty well. The story follows a UN Doctor who must travel around the world to stop a deadly zombie outbreak threatening to destroy the entire human race. The plot, while it deviates from the book in many ways, is really well done and really well told. Brad Pitt stars as the main character: Gerry Lane. Brad Pitt pulls off his role perfectly, and truthfully this is one of the best performances of his career. You buy him as a really smart family man who just wants to ensure his family's survival. The other actors do well in their roles as well, and their characters are pretty interesting and well fleshed out. How are the zombies: F*cking AWESOME! Now, I now some hardcore zombie loyalist (Otherwise known as idiots) are all up in arms cause according to then ""They aren't true zombies. Why couldn't you make them slow?"" Let me ask you guys a question: which do you find scarier: A slow ass zombie or a sprinting zombie who charges at you. Obviously you would say the latter. Fast zombies make for a far greater threat, and a better apocalypse. Slow zombies would get their asses kicked truthfully. And the makeup for the zombies here is really well done, and they are really threatening. What truly sells World War Z is the great action scenes. This is a summer blockbuster so naturally this is expected, but still: WOW. But by far my favorite part is when they have to sneak around the zombies: The suspension and levels of tension are almost unbearable. And the fast pacing of the film ensures that you will never grow bored. Overall, World War Z is a success. With great performances, awesome zombies, great pacing, and gripping terror, World War Z is truthfully one of the best zombie movies we have had since since the 2004 Dawn of The Dead Remake, and is actually better than 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

However, if my Google research is correct, the movie has very little to do with the book. And if history taught us anything is that movie adaptations are often not as good as the books they are trying to adapt - especially if they greatly differ from their source material. I, for one, didn't read the book and am not able to judge whether World War Z was or wasn't a successful adaptation. But I can judge World War Z as a stand alone movie and I must say - it's not particularly good.The movie is mostly about Brad Pitt's character - a former U.N. employee named Gerry Lane - trying to find a cure for the zombie outbreak. There isn't much plot to World War Z and the story hasn't got any important establishing points. That is one of the problems with World War Z - there is no real plot development. World War Z ""compensates"" for the lack of a coherent story with being a fast paced/action packed movie. The movie's action sequences literally start within the first several minutes and almost never stop during this 2 hour long ADD fest. To be honest, there is some mild social commentary to be found somewhere in the story, but nothing significantly distinguishable from the usual clichés.Besides the weak plot, World War Z, unfortunately, has a problem with how it portrays zombies. It was obvious that World War Z wanted to break the world record for the movie with the largest number of zombies. Of course, the creators of this movie couldn't possibly achieve this goal by using only actors with make-up so they created the huge zombie masses by using CGI. As a result of that, the zombies in World War Z look very artificial. Sometimes I even felt like I was watching something from a live action video game (not unlike Left 4 Dead), which definitely isn't a good thing. In conclusion, I mostly enjoyed the movie during the third act, when the actual actors in make-up replace the inane computer-generated caricatures.Furthermore, World War Z doesn't really invest in its characters, save from Brad Pitt's character: they are all bland, one dimensional and boring - and when uninteresting characters die/fight for their lives there isn't much drama to it. Still, if you're not really that interested in drama/characters/overall story and just want to watch action scenes and eat popcorn - World War Z is the movie for you, since there are some really impressive and tense action scenes. As for the rest of you, I certainly wouldn't recommend World War Z because of how disappointing the movie feels - it's just a weak shadow of something that could have been great.Rating: 5/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/","15 out of 36 found this helpful.

And based on the book by Max Brooks. Talk about huge expectations. It's not the best movie with 'zombies', but I would say it's the best at showing the grand scale of the outbreak and devastation on the world.I'll start with the things I really liked. Brad Pitt's character and his wife just seem like the ultimate survival power couple who support each other 100 percent. Pitt is constantly smart throughout, and so casual and cool about it all that it makes him very likeable. Their adventure to save the human race takes them all around the world, so you get to see how other countries are handling the situation.Now for the negative. The zombies... in real life they would be terrifying. They move with speed, hyper aggression, and don't seem to get tired or injured. However, they don't quite have the same scare effect as other super fast zombies such as in '28 Days Later' or 'Dawn of the Dead'. I think a main reason for this is the lack of gory zombies due to the PG-13 rating. The other reason is the obvious CGI zombie hordes. 'I am Legend' comes to mind, though this is not as bad.This is clearly an action movie, not a horror. It has its tense moments, but it's too fast paced to really build up any continued suspense or dread.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The acting is lame, Pitt is just dumb, and the rest of the cast just drags along for the ride. The most insane part of this junk, is that they ""lamed it up"" so to speak, in the most classic Hollywood fashion. They went for a large audience and made a PG-13 Zombie flick!!! Typical Hollywood, all about money and no thought about quality. I've been watching Zombie flicks for years, long before the Zombie-craze even took off back in '96. This is an embarrassment to not only the Zombie genre, but the whole horror genre as well. I like it when Brad Pitt does a good job, then he is really good, but what the heck had he been smoking on the set of this thing?

I'm not one to go into detail about every single facet of the movie, I prefer to simply mention the things that stood out to me that I liked, and the things that I disliked. I enjoyed the special effects, they were realistic enough to shock me and gave the zombies a surreal edge that made them scarier whilst still keeping the essential human traits. At times when the 'waves' of zombies chased the main characters it looked awesome!I think it really added that sense of suspense that in my opinion is a key ingredient in a good zombie flick. I must add that I am quite partial to zombie movies, and they have to be pretty terrible for me to dislike them. lol I think this movie is watchable, maybe not one you would watch again, but definitely worth a look for any avid horror movie/zombie flick fans. Those who watch it simply to perve on Brad Pitt may be disappointed that he has really tried to go for the 'average joe' look in this film, so I wouldn't watch it for this reason.The love story angle isn't over done here either, which is a refreshing change. Also I like the fact that it shows all different cultures throughout the globe and different countries, because I get SO sick of movies that only show America, and are lucky to even MENTION any other countries let alone religions associated with other cultures. This diversity made this movie more interesting and unique to me. Anyways, this is just my opinion, it won't be enjoyable for everyone, but I hope this information helps give an honest, clear image of the type of film this is, and might help readers decide whether it sounds like something they would enjoy.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

If it wasn't for the countless unrealistic bits in there, this would be one of the best zombie movies I've seen so far. There were also several major holes in the plot such as the reason behind Brad Pitt being chosen to lead the mission when there were plenty of other, probably more qualified, personnel on board and more notably in the ending scenes where he just somehow (out of hundreds of viles) picked the antidote that ended up working on the first try. The whole plane scene had me lost too and none of that really made any sense (because stacking 20 lb suitcases will obviously hold back super manic, blood thirsty zombies).Overall, I still loved the movie, especially the CGI in every aspect of it - they went big there.

One good example is that they didn't have stupid/ignorant characters doing idiotic things to get others killed(apart from the singing...), which seems to be a staple in most zombie movies..

"8","/10","Action-horror flick brings out the fun and energy","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3315616/?ref_=tt_urv","Screen_Blitz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24623283/?ref_=tt_urv","12 September 2015","In this action-horror flick based on the hit novel by Max Brooks, Brad Pitt plays Gerry Lane, a retired United Nations work with a plan on taking his wife (played by Mirielle Enos) and two young daughters on a vacation. His plans are quickly interrupted when a deadly pandemic scatters through their town in Philidelphia and causes a massive zombie invasion. Before too long, zombies begin taking over the universe as the virus spreads on a global scale. In an effort to save the future of mankind, Gerry must travel across the world in search for a cure to the virus while surviving the massive zombie onslaught. This film is directed by Marc Foster who made Kite Runner (2007) and Quantum Solace (2008).This film is an adaption to Max Brook's novel World War Z, but it does however manage to take many liberties from the novel and create a complete original story. Nonetheless, this film does not fail to entertain and bring on the thrills. Many fans however were sparked with disappointment when they learned of the PG-13 rating. While it does take away from the blood and gory fun that many zombie fans root for, the film manages to be fun and action-packed without heavy use of blood and gore. The action sequences were spectacular and the same can be said for the special effects. The zombies look good while maintain their gross, sickish appearance. The zombie attack scene on the airplane was probably the best scene throughout the film. It really showed the best of the special effects this film carries. Unlike most zombie films, the zombies in this one are super fast and when someone gets bitten and infected, they turn within a matter of ""like"" ten seconds. The plot also worked well here, even though the pacing does slip towards the final stretch. As the story progresses, it comes clear that it is not exactly about zombies attacking the world, but focuses on the downfall of humanity. On the other hand, it is still action-packed and compelling as it needs to be.World War Z is one of the best summer flicks of 2013. Even if its not too faithful to Max Brook's source material, it is still enjoyable and succeeds with an entertaining story, dazzling special effects, and action scenes that will hold your attention.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's an above-average entry in the zombie genre, and sufficiently well made to amuse casual viewers as well.World War Z reminded me of several other films I've greatly enjoyed. It has the fast zombies and epidemiological viewpoint of 28 Days Later. It has the exciting round-the-world quest of Roland Emmerich's 2012. And it even borrows a bit from the cult favorite Plane Dead. The action sequences are spectacular, the acting is solid, and the whole package is very satisfying.It's true, there are a few obvious lapses in logic, but nothing that shouldn't be forgivable in a genre film like this. An early example: if the plague takes 12 seconds to convert a living human into a zombie (a novel idea, in itself), how could it be spread by air travellers? Everyone on board a plane ought to be dead before the doors are sealed. But the general sense of the film is good. All you need to know is it's a contagion, and we need to fight it using medical science, as opposed to, say, wooden stakes and garlic.World War Z won't be mistaken for a work of genius, but it is a lot of fun. Break out the popcorn, and don't let nit-picking reviews put you off.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

But the idea that zombies are both fast and ""swarm"" (like ants crawling on top of each other) to climb a huge wall is a unique twist that could make this movie fun to watch (written May 2013).And it ended up being a blast. It introduced an original story-line to the zombie-apocalypse genre. First, an origin to why the zombie plague started. Second, the potential for a cure? And lastly, Brad Pitt as the best dad/survivalist ever. If I had to pick my team to battle the zombie apocalypse, I'd want Brad on my team, no matter that he is 20 times more handsome than me. (written July 2013)Afternote: If you saw the movie, don't read the book. In this rare case, the book falls short of the movie. The book is told in ""documentary-style"" based on memos etc. that recall the events ""after"" World War Z. The movie tells it in real-time which is how it should be experienced.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Its a big budget action thriller and on that note the action/zombie apocalypse happens almost immediately (5 minutes into film) so that you don't get a chance to know the characters before the sh!t hits the fan.Who is this dad Brad Pitt? Why are he (and his wife for that matter) so calm and excepting of the mayhem taking place around them? They just take it in stride, gather some supplies, a weapon and carry on.Eventually this does (sort of) get explained, Pitt is a former UN worker who must come back for that dreaded ""one last job"" in order to keep his family safe aboard an aircraft carrier while he races against time to save humanity from a pandemic that has triggered a global war between mankind and the undead.I'm not a fan of the fast moving zombie but it works here as this is more of a pandemic movie than a zombie movie. I really liked the section in Israel, exciting, unique and well done with the zombies all piling on top of each other to climb a huge wall, swarming like the ants shown in the random opening images. I also enjoyed the plane crash and the section at the WHO lab in Cardiff with Mr.snappy teeth zombie.This is definitely more a pandemic movie than a true zombie movie and there's very little gore shown, mostly just CGI special effects. I also wouldn't call this a horror movie, its not so scary. I think I might like this more in a rewatch when I'm not expecting Walking Dead-esque events. 3/13/16","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I had read the book previously and am a bit of a Zombie fan and the movie did not disappoint. Great set pieces, solid acting, CGI good. Had a real blockbuster feel that most Zombie movies don't offer. The Zs were scary and the plot actually made sense. If I was going to be picky it would actually be Pitts character. Pitt acted well and was well cast but for a character who is supposed to be the best at what he does (whatever that actually is) he does not half make a few mistakes which in turn does cause the death of a few people. He is a proper bad luck charm for many in this movie. Anyway, great movie and hope they get around to making a sequel.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Being have Brad Pitt as the leader actor or the main character that's definitely added a lot in the movie. it's really a great action and the fear in it is delivered so well. the family scenes was addition to the goodness of the movie, the father daughters moments was amazing I by myself enjoyed watching Brad Pitt as the family man and he is absolutely good in it. the main character Jerry (Brad Pitt) have to go to seek a cure to this horrible virus just to keep his family safe in one of the most safest places. the obstacles he faced during his journey was extremely dangerous. the way he saved the female soldier. the way he thought to get a cure was smart. the whole movie is worth to watch even more than once.

My favorite part and in my opinion, the scariest part of this movie is the mass panic and the hysteria of people fighting for groceries, guns and shelter in the midst of a yet unknown terror. For those people that just wanted to see gallons of blood and brain eatings, this is not the movie for them. This movie goes in another direction. If I had two criticisms, it was the ""movie science"" they employed (Mother Nature leaves clues / Animals instinctively can detect disease, etc.) and that the zombies were simultaneously clever and stupid, fast and slow, weak and strong, whenever the movie needed them to be. Overall, and to my surprise, I recommend it.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

His head up his ass pretentious direction is irksome and unintentionally hilarious at the same time because of how piss poor it is. Quantum Of Solace was unintentionally comedic at many points because of the implausible situations and lack of any real flow it had and those stupid film school gimmicks he so relies on to seem profound to people who are unaware of what truly good filmmaking is. Pretentious film gimmicks don't equal talented direction This movie follows in making similar mistakes that movie made. Only difference is, Daniel Craig was able to carry that turkey. Brad Pitt could not save this DOA trainwreck. What could've been a riveting adaptation of a gripping and suspenseful novel wound up being an absolute farce, full of silly plot developments, one dimensional characters, a flagrant disregard for the laws of physics and filmmaking, a lack of wit and imagination, every film school gimmick under the sun, etc. When i found out this was the last commercial film that twit Forster directed, i was ecstatic. Avoid this turkey. Hopefully, a talented film maker will properly adapt the novel of WWZ and amend this embarrassing farcical.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

Before I give you my review of the movie, first let me give you some insight on my zombie movie history.I've always loved zombie movies. Whether it be Shaun of the Dead, Dawn of the Dead, Night of The Living Dead, Land of the Dead, 28 Days/Weeks Later, Zombieland, Resident Evil (all of them), Planet Terror, Dead Alive, Walking Dead (the series), etc., I've always just been fascinated with the genre. Unfortunately I've never been much of a reader, so Max Brook's novel of have eluded me. That's not to say that I wasn't extremely excited to hear that a movie adaptation of his book(s) was being prepared for the big screen. The movie of course had a rough start since it was hindered by production delays, a bloated budget, and other miscellaneous bad press prior to its release. All of this gave me some concerns, but it wasn't enough to dissuade me from wanting to see the movie. It wasn't until I read a plethora of negative reviews about the movie from this site that I became worried this movie was gonna be a dud. I had almost made up my mind to not go and see it in the theaters, when my girlfriend and I decided ""screw it, lets go and see what all of the negative reviews are about"". We are both extremely glad that we ignored the user reviews we read and went and saw this movie in the theaters. It was money well spent.World War Z is a great global zombie epidemic movie. I have to say that this movie was so much bigger than any other zombie movie I have scene, and I've seen almost all of them. All of the other zombie movies out there are small scale. They are primarily focused on rural areas of a country, or a specific city or state. They would always explain that the zombie epidemic was a global issue, but aside from seeing quick news flashes or a radio announcement, we never got to see or experience the full ""global zombie epidemic"" first hand. World War Z gives us that. It's an edge of your seat movie that doesn't leave you with a dull moment and keeps you wanting more. I know that there are people that read the book and say that the movie strays too much from the source material, but you shouldn't care about that. If you like/love zombie movies like I do see this movie for what it is... A great zombie movie. If you've read the book, erase the memory of the book from your mind and just go see this movie fresh, without spending every second comparing it to it's source material. See this movie because it takes you someplace no other zombie movie has, ""global"". It has great special effects, great dialog, great actors/actresses, great action sequences, and it also seems to accurately portray the cause and effect that a zombie epidemic of such grandeur would have on our world. It's an impressive movie that is at the top of my list of all-time best zombie movies because it gives us the one thing no other zombie movie has. It gives us World War Z. See This Movie!","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

That right there is enough to show that 92.7% of all people who negatively reviewed this amazing film just had nothing better to do.Based on a #1 selling novel, World War Z pushes the envelope for Zombie filmography. The political, environmental and human overtones in this film set the bar for this genre; And set it apart from all the greats.Meticulously well written and directed, with a stellar cast and amazing filmography, this is easily one of the best entries into the 2013 Blockbuster season. Brad Pitt does a phenomenal job as an ex-UN investigator trying to uncover the cause of this apocalyptic event and searching for a means out to save mankind.That's all I'll say about the movie, because you need to see it and not browse synopsis's and reviews to see if you might wanna watch it.

It is awful how they propogate false information as truth and so many people fall for it when history proves otherwise.Bicycles. When was the last time you heard a bicycle squeak so much? I can point to very few times in my life where a bicycle squeaked even after being stored for years. I wonder what happened to their oil cans.The biggest propaganda is the WHO being a world savior of mankind.Brad Pit may not be the best in all roles, but when he gets the chance to be great, he surpasses it. The dynamics of him, his family, the people he meets along the way, makes for an intriquing and wonderful end of the world story. I am very happy that the propaganda did not ruin it.

So I watch this movie and.... obviously this movie different enough from another zombie's movie. This movie was played by Bradd Pitt as Gerry Lane and he has a family and Lane against the zombie not to save himself but Lane has family and he has to save his family. Lane as ex member of PBB was assigned to find out what was really happening.
In this movie, the acting of Bradd Pitt is so good. I like the way when he has a brave to fight with the zombies even Bradd Pit focused on a little things in his role and the acting all the cast are also pretty good. I'm not quite satisfied with computer visual. The computer visual is too visible, so sometimes I have no feeling to watch espesially the scene in jerussalem when the zombies climb the big wall. This movie is based on novel in 2006 with the same title by max brooks. I don't know well about the novel because I never read that novel. Scenario is written by Matthew Michael Carnahan quite interesting till get profits 540 million USD and I think it is appropriate.
In the end of this movie, there is statement that I think this movie will be continued because I think the story is still not finished. Lane just find a drug for disguise not to cure. I dont know, there is a cure or not but the story should be continued. I heard that there is World War Zombie 2 in 2016 but until now still not yet because there is problem with the price of the production, i dont know it is right or not but I still look forward to the sequel,Let's hope and prayyy ....","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It was refreshing to not have guessed what was going to happen ten minutes in either, I had no clue, and certainly didn't expect to spend my walk home from the cinema jumping out of my skin at every person walking by me in the narrow lanes of Brighton.

And it's not even a good scream, alas Dakota Fanning in War of the worlds. It's one of those annoying kids with a group of friends at the cinema scream, I thought I had hit the jackpot seeing the movie when there was no kids there to ruin it with the melodramatic screaming but this movie comes with its very own built in!Speaking of Dakota Fanning in war of the worlds, the movie pretty much steals a scene right out of it; you know when the aliens first arrive and start destroying stuff and the character Rachel starts screaming for her Mother? Yeah that scene, except the mother is already in the car in WWZ so the kid screams for a non existent blanket. Even the kids name is the same.Conclusion - This kid destroys what could of been a good movie. I spent the entire movie trying to work out if the kid was supposed to have autism or asperbergs or something instead of paying attention to the action, at least then it's stupid behavior such as sitting in a trolley screaming, making her father run back in a zombie infested street to get a stuffed animal and running back down stairs when the rest of the family are running up to catch a helicopter to escape as the zombies have literally just broken through the door, would make more sense. And this all happens in the first 10 minutes, I will spare you the details of the rest of this kids nauseating role. You'll thank me if you decide to watch it. but I'd avoid if you are emotionally attached to your ear drums. Don't say I didn't warn you.","14 out of 35 found this helpful.

The most fascinating moment is when Brad Pitt as UN employee debates with all aspects of society, family, immigrant, zombies, supervisor, and virologists to persist something that he doesn't understand too much.

Though the movie makers feed us with all the joy they can in that single environment but our wish isn't still fulfilled. Well, World War Z fulfills that wish and gives almost all the goosebumps that a normal zombie movie lacks. It covers all the action and killing scenes and for a surprise, at different places of the world. Brad Pitt plays a major role both in acting and balancing of the film.

This is said to those - including I myself - who have always considered such movies to be repulsive and crummy. I have constantly associated Zombie Movies with the top-notch work of art by Francis Lawrence, ""I Am Legend"" and that's it. The rest of them were just cookie cutter unimaginative repetition of the first few decent pioneers with teeny tiny alterations to the main theme. Back to ""World War Z"", there is a lot to be said about this awesome movie. First and foremost, the special effects were simply legendary. The Special Effects Technician needs only a few minutes to keep the viewers on the edge of their seats. In my humble opinion, the first twenty minutes is absolutely fantastic where the audience realizes the gravity of the situation and starts identifying with the humans in the movie. That would not have happened if the Special Effects Crew hadn't been so creative and professional and if millions of dollars hadn't been spent making all this possible. This consequential quality is circulated throughout the movie. In the middle of all this rage and struggle for survival, the movie uses a couple of symbols to make a few points. ""Blanket"" which the little girl asks for at the beginning of the movie symbolizes the warmth of home which seems to be far-off even after ten minutes. Wrapping your son or daughter in a blanket helps them feel loved and cared for even when you are gone. The main gist of Warmbrunn's story in Jerusalem is that governments attempt to solve problems rather than prevent them from becoming problems in the first place. This governmental habit costs many people their lives in the zombie wars (and probably doesn't help us much out in the real world, either). There's no doubt that Israel is viewed in the film as the promised land (until it's not). The wall that Israel has built around the country – explained and justified by a Mossad agent as a natural reaction to Arab aggression since 1948 (although Palestinians are not named specifically) – suggests that the film-maker and writers wanted to portray the Jewish state as a (temporary) shelter from zombies (read Arabs). The stupendous amount of stress laid on this part of the movie makes it perhaps the biggest cinematic propaganda for Israel which I honestly didn't dig at all. This is what this part of the movie is trying to depict here: Okay, so Israel falls to the zombie plague, too. But at least it lasted longer than everybody else. Plus, when Pitt is trying to escape to the next location, he takes Daniella Kertesz as the brave, beautiful Jewish soldier along with him. The cinematography is stunning. The techniques used in this movie are the ones I've mostly seen in documentaries where the bird's eye view describes everything thoroughly and the viewer seems to grasp the magnitude of the problem. The acting is totally defendable. The whole ensemble is professional even the small-time actors. Brad Pitt being the lead actor has shown to be a totally versatile one whose fabulous acting stuns me whenever I see him on the silver screen. All in all, ""World War Z"" provides the professional viewer with a second chance to reconsider their former thoughts about such movies and simultaneously endeavors to convey some political as well as religious messages in some particular parts of the movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

One of the most unique and intriguing parts about the making of World War Z was how they created this new generation of zombie. To produce this fast moving and extremely intense monster, the production team relied on the use of ""CGI"". The team recorded many different types of movements and simulated these mobs in order to create the perfect mass zombie attacks. In addition to creating zombies, many different parts of the film were computer generated. For example, during the thrilling attack in Israel featured in the trailer, when the helicopter is crashed by the hoard of zombies, which was created through CGI. Whenever a certain scene proved too difficult to shoot traditionally, CGI was used. In addition the successful integration of CGI, the traditional camera work, acting, and music played an equally important role in the film. The fast and sometimes shaky camera-work along with the cuts created a thrilling feel to important scenes. Both the camera-work and music worked alongside each other to generate the right emotions in every scene. Obviously, the acting was important to the film as well, without the acting of every character the film would not have been as successful as it was. With the combination of all of these elements, World War Z will go down in the books as a unique and successful adaptation of a novel into a major motion picture.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"2","/10","An astonishingly poor film, it could've been one-of-a-kind, instead we get this.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2855024/?ref_=tt_urv","kowski-731-276936","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23220895/?ref_=tt_urv","21 August 2013","Casting my mind back to 2008/2009, I could barely contain my excitement upon hearing the unique novel 'World War Z, an Oral History of the Zombie Wars' by Max Brooks was being taken onto the big screen. Wonderful, I though, the practically limitless elements of the book they can show here with the budget available, which is why Max Brooks deigned it workable in the first place. I envisaged Yonkers, brought to life with cutting edge CGI and up close shots with the same make-up artists who'd renowned themselves on the sets of The Walking Dead. Adding to this, I could practically taste the deep political, religious and military tidal waves Brooks placed in his book, the nuclear exchanges, the Jewish Civil War, the infamous Reddeker plan and its subsequent adaptations by other nations. The years ticked on and I followed the slowly leaked information avidly. From the script- writer changes to budgeting issues and the shelving and re-announcing of sequels, I was starting to lose hope. Surely, surely they wouldn't let this slip? I'm not naive enough to assume that it was an easy book to transgress into film-adaptation, but what we have is a paintball gun's attempt to match a world-famous art piece, it could've been presented in a way that showed the deep repercussions of humanity at war with the undead, rather then a half-dozen areas where, frankly, very little happens. The film opens, after a brief montage of world catastrophes, with Gerry Lane (Pitt) who has left his life as a UN Investigator and turned to his family. Overall, the acting from Pitt and to a large extent the cast at large is excellent. Nothing to write home about, but certainly successful. Its only a few minutes before we're dropped in on the action, but its also the final point in which this film's control is lost. There's elements to this film that will have you rolling your eyes, tutting and simply shaking your head in a 'what-were-they-thinking?' manner. Direct conflicts with the book, without sharing spoilers, are rife and the film becomes a flashy remake of B-movie zombie flicks. Throughout the book, the undead are slow, slouching and not an ounce of intelligence. In the film it seems every zombie is an olympic athlete with a promising future in acrobatics. They tip over buses, repeatedly manage to find their way into cars, rooms and buildings with head-butting and there are even zombies who hide silently, only making themselves known when they're discovered in ridiculous places two hundred people would've noticed them tuck in to. The film also makes practically no use of the geo-political shades used in the novel. We see none of the major elements and only a brief nod to a nuclear strike, but we have no idea by who, against what or its effects. We see nothing of the Israeli Civil War and certainly nothing of the Russian religious oligarchy beginning. No ferals in American cities, no mention to the space station's constant updates, etc. They took barely anything from the book, which in most cases I'd admire but when you've a golden goose just waiting to be used and you instead douse that goose in tar, you've taken a poor step in the wrong direction. Another injustice to this is its age-rating. Now, I understand the need to make films more accessible to a wider audience, but I do not believe this is the way. Zombies are pitched back but we see only speckles of blood here, explosions tear through crowds and the bodies just disappear, people are torn to the ground like animals and ripped to shreds and yet the camera cuts away conveniently. This is the grime of the novel we could've of had but we're denied by the ridiculousness of a wider audience. I wont mention the final, most ridiculous plot-twist of any film I've ever seen to those who haven't seen the novel but the element introduced by Gerry's glimpses of the sick made me want to punch the script-writer in the face for this monstrosity of an idea. World War Z is a poor film. The CGI is fairly decent, but it would've been excellent to see more make-up padded humans play zombies rather then CGI through and through. Furthermore, the acting is on par and its entertainment at the end of the day. Though I'd encourage anyone who hasn't yet seen the films or read the books to read said books; they're remarkable and put this film spin off firmly into its grave. Well, a potentially unique and awe-inspiring film wasted. Just wasted.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt),a United Nations employee is enlisted with a group to protect people from a zombie pandemic that is spreading quick.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

When Stanley Kramer filmed the apocalyptic Melbourne-based film On the Beach in the late 1950s, its co-star, Ava Gardner, was quoted as stating that 'Melbourne was the perfect place to make a film about the end of the world.' It's now widely accepted that the story is erroneous and the delightful Ava made no such disparaging remark – not publicly anyway. However, the sentiment stuck as at the time it had a semblance of truth about it.It seems just as appropriate therefore, that in making a film about zombies, Marc Forster, should deem it fit to base the action in Wales. Sadly, it appears that this was the best and only good idea anyone behind the film ever had.A vehicle for Brad Pitt, who co-produced, the film barely contains any new idea or stroke of inspiration. This is film-making by numbers, giving the impression it was made to order by a committee of middle managers.The opening, all too familiar scenario, of Brad Pitt as Gerry Lane, a retired UN 'investigator', now a happily domesticated full-time father, being reluctantly dragged out of retirement for one last job in exchange for his family's safety really set the hackneyed tone for the rest of the film.As zombies worldwide infect the population through biting, desperate UN officials assign Lane as protector to British doctor Andrew Fassbach who it seems is the only person who might be able to detect the cause of the outbreak and thus discover a cure. After the early demise of Dr Fassbach, it falls to Brad Pitt, apparently with no medical training, to take over his work and save the world. It's a zombie film, I wasn't looking for realism, but, please, there are still limits. Besides, the North Koreans already seemed to have the perfect answer. Over a 24 hour period, they simply set up a program whereby their 23 million citizens had all their teeth extracted – no teeth, no biting, no infection. Simple.The scenes of mass panic with the zombie undead attacking panicking humans and piling themselves up against fortified walls in order to breach them gave the impression that this was a film based on a graphic computer game.The film appeared to be without subtext or purpose and it was difficult to retain interest or care about the participants.There were some humorous moments, though whether these were intentional or not was hard to gauge. But at least it provided the audience I saw the film with several laughs.The acting, the direction, the cinematography are all ordinary – I saw the film in 2D. The script is below par. The end clearly set the film up for a sequel and I'm since given to understand that two are planned. Whether they materialise remains to be seen.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

So I watch this movie and.... obviously this movie different enough from another zombie's movie. This movie was played by Bradd Pitt as Gerry Lane and he has a family and Lane against the zombie not to save himself but Lane has family and he has to save his family. Lane as ex member of PBB was assigned to find out what was really happening.In this movie, the acting of Bradd Pitt is so good. I like the way when he has a brave to fight with the zombies even Bradd Pit focused on a little things in his role and the acting all the cast are also pretty good. I'm not quite satisfied with computer visual. The computer visual is too visible, so sometimes I have no feeling to watch espesially the scene in jerussalem when the zombies climb the big wall. This movie is based on novel in 2006 with the same title by max brooks. I don't know well about the novel because I never read that novel. Scenario is written by Matthew Michael Carnahan quite interesting till get profits 540 million USD and I think it is appropriate.In the end of this movie, there is statement that I think this movie will be continued because I think the story is still not finished. Lane just find a drug for disguise not to cure. I dont know, there is a cure or not but the story should be continued. I heard that there is World War Zombie 2 in 2016 but until now still not yet because there is problem with the price of the production, I dont know it is right or not but I still look forward to the sequel,Let's hope and prayyy ....","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

The story is great, the plot is great, it was simply an enjoyable movie. usually zombie movies are the same, but World War Z is different. I think by now you got my message!2: Brad Pitt is the main actor😝 Not to brag about it but Brad Pitt is always situated in movies that are usually pretty darn good with pretty high ratings.I couldn't believe as I read, a lot of mislead scrambled viewers rated this movie a 1 or 2 because the zombies where not looking too realistic, the story behind the cure or the virus is flat out lame, or the relationship of the characters was moved through too quickly that we weren't fully or close to partially familiar with them.

More to the point, be content with looking elsewhere, because - guess what - IT'S A FREAKING ZOMBIE MOVIE.What the film nails is the design and behaviour of the zombies. Through some good editing and good CG (for the most-part), they end up being extremely freaky, with a type of supernatural quality that sets them apart from all other zombies. That, combined with the sheer number of them on-screen, adds up to an intensity in the action scenes that will makes for uncomfortable watching, in a good way.The whole plot point regarding how they combat the infection is pretty original, as far as I'm aware.Don't listen to reviews from elitists - if you're looking for a good ol' fashioned nom-em-up, you could do a whole lot worse than World War Z.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

It has some suspenseful scenes that can reflect a horror film though. Marc Forster has become a blockbuster director, and he previously was more of an Oscar type director, but ever since Quantum of Solace where he did an exceptional job with the action sequences, he was able to enter the realm of blockbuster entertainment. His direction is exceptional, and his style actually adds a bit of ""grit"" to the action scenes and the overall film itself.

One of the better aspects here is the way this one manages to handle the infection here without really going all overboard with the concept of the infection. Presenting this in a series of trips around the world is quite a nice feat for that, managing to occupy a large portion of screen time here with the idea of going through the different stages of the efforts to contain it in the varying stages is quite an effective ploy here with the shock of the emerging creatures on the world soon turning into the main storyline which is that cross-global investigation. That also leads into the film's main plus here, which is the exciting and incredibly fun action scenes that are exhilarating as they tend to showcase a lot more than initially expected here with the opening swarm running through gridlocked New York in a seemingly massive ambush that comes off incredibly well, much like the slightly smaller supermarket sequence or the apartment escape but really culminates with the attack in Israel which features the swarm seemingly adamant about scaling the massive fortified walls and then going after the gathered survivors below which is a true spectacle that shows them overtaking the city quite easily and providing the showcase for the big escape scene. It's fun and grand in a big way which is quite nice but really shows off the CGI all too well which is the main problem here. Not that the look isn't bad, but on the whole the ravenous swarm just looks and moves too fake to really make for a believable person running around the cities and jumping over each other in massive groups. There's some great scenes but they just tend to come off way too fake here. Other than the lack of gore here which isn't too surprising considering the fact that it's more about the survival rather than the shock of seeing them rip people to pieces, this one really comes off quite well.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and children-in-jeopardy.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Hmm...actually I was wondering whether the 'monsters' in this movie were technically zombies...I didn't think so, but later in the movie they are described in a way which fits in with 'conventional' notions of zombies.The opening credits pretty much blames the U.N. for the zombie pandemic...which perhaps makes lead actor Brad Pitt's character of U.N. 'trouble shooter' Gerry Lane an ironic hero (not sure if that irony still remains after a scene in Israel with a key figure there).World War Z (I say it ""Zed"" damn it! Perhaps it's meant to rhyme in the American way with ""3""?) doesn't go in for long introductory scenes of life before the pandemic. There's a little of that at the start of the movie with Gerry's family (a wife and two girls). Such scenes are meant to ground Gerry but to me his family seem little more than props. Then again, Gerry doesn't seem a completely grounded character...but this is a zombie movie after all...what did you expect?Pretty soon the world has gone to Hell in a handbasket, overrun with 'zombies'. There are many tense scenes with Gerry (and his family) in imminent danger. Although retired from his U.N. duties, Gerry is roped into helping to defeat the zombie threat.Gerry ends up travelling to many countries trying to find the origin of the pandemic. Displaying the new fad of representing zombies, these hordes are not the shuffling slow pokes of a George A. Romero zombie movie...whilst not exactly supernatural seeming as in the movie ""I am legend"", they are a force to be reckoned with. I liked how they posed a greater threat as a group even though they were acting individually...as if their collective intelligence was far greater than that of any one individual. In any case, the action is basically all Hollywood...incredible odds, then overcook those to make the hero seem even more heroic. Then there are the Hollywood clichés to add even more tension to an already tense scene. At times such Hollywoodisations just over-egged the pudding for me.Previously I mentioned that Israel is a location for one of Gerry's trips. That section of the movie was interesting. It did make me wonder what was the subtext here? That it turns out that it was a good idea for Israel to build a wall between itself and the outside world? All in all, this was a tense and entertaining movie. The movie's zombies are unlike those of such pioneering efforts such as ""Night of the living dead"" and those not into gore and ""Ewww!"" will appreciate the different emphasis of this movie.Personally, I'd like to see a 'slow burn' zombie movie...taking the time to establish life before the threat and to slowly build into the end of the world scenario...hopefully drawing sympathetic characters in the process. Equally important would be to have the 'zombies' not be some sort of super human monsters...more in the George A. Romero mould...but then again, not technically either! I.e. a compromise between these two representations of zombies. The mechanics of how people turned into zombies in World War Z didn't really convince me...but I was happy to suspend disbelief.Saw this movie on an extra-widescreen and in 3D. The extra dimension doesn't really warrant the extra money at the box office though...however, I had some loyalty reward points which meant that I could see it in this form for around half the price of a half-price Tuesday regular 2D movie.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

It's aim isn't to scare you, make you jump or gross you out, it's simply one cool action scene after another.

Main problem is that the movie was jumping from side to side on the good/bad scale, like a cricket on meth. First off, I am a huge fan of the Zombie genre and this movie had one of the best survival scenes i've seen, and i've seen a lot :) And on the other hand we had a completely illogical, lacking basic sense main plot, the absurdity of witch was so irritating it would be better to have no plot at all. Then jumping back to the good stuff, the cast and their acting were great. Problem is the environment established by the main plot (not by the z's) did not give the actors any chance to grow their potentials. So simply put, if you are a big zombie fan and not so much on complexity, originality, or as a matter of fact any basic concept of storyline, you will greatly enjoy this movie. The opposite and you will hate it. I can see how the average rating would reflect on the current trend of the viewers in matter of that aspect :)","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Brooks had written WWZ with extreme clarity and precision and a strong, serious tone. It was appealing to read the book, it was much more interesting than the title suggests. The story-line was based on a typical heroic archetype structure, very linear and, in a way, unoriginal. I find myself strongly siding with Henry Barnes, because it's been a long-standing problem in the Zombie genre to take the performance so seriously.

Whereas Brooks presented the story as a series of detached stories, which help form the bigger picture, the pretty large cast of scriptwriters opted for a more cinematic approach, mostly owed to the preference of having one on-screen hero, instead of a multitude of short-lived appearances. Given the fact that Brad Pitt is the main star, it was pretty apparent that the super-powered actor would feature full-length and not be underutilised to one of many small segments.Therefore Brad Pitt as UN operative Gerry Lane functions as the heart and soul, saviour and protector, lock, stock and barrel, taking on a one man army stance against the zombie onslaught, flying across the globe from New York to Korea, Israel or Wales. Naturally this is somewhat of an over-reach on my behalf, as Lane is much more frail a figure, requiring SEALs to protect his behind, nonetheless to an exaggerated extent Lane becomes the soul of almost everything positive in this movie, as all the events and actions of the novel are appropriated to Pitt. The movie starts off inconspicuously with Gerry Lane joyously preparing pancakes for his family of four - his wife Karin (a welcome appearance by Mireille Enos) and two daughters Constance (Sterling Jerins) and Rachel (Abigail Hargrove). Slowly news of the appearance of zombies start filtering through the media, but nothing has the world prepared for what is about to take place, when a sudden appearance of the zombie virus has New York quickly fall into chaos, panic and a tidal wave of destruction. Having successfully escaped with his family onto an aircraft carrier off the coast of America, Gerry Lane is quickly employed (as a specialist on survival danger areas) to assist the UN in finding out the source of the sickness, which turns people into undead within a matter of seconds or minutes (depending on the strain). Meanwhile the outbreak goes global...At times immaculately intense, bubbling with relentless tension, at others moments frightening to the core, while not bypassing the potential for pure unadulterated spectacle, ""World War Z"" is a surprisingly effective movie, which deservedly soared towards box-office glory. Despite its rabid pacing, the story almost never unravels aimlessly, instead affording much time for the situations to intensify, just before the explode with a vengeance. Ignoring the pure simple shock factors, director Marc Forster inspirationally forms scenes overladen with both horror and emotion.Probably the best all-out zombie feature since ""28 Day Later"", ""World War Z"" does feature several innate common characteristics, mostly so by redefining the threat as something more akin to rabbis, than to decomposing bodies lazily sulking around. Zombies here are fast, furious and unrelenting, giving them a more frightening presence, which lacks in most such movies (and well ridiculed by features such as ""Shaun of the Dead""). The threat suddenly becomes more visceral, as the attacks are reminiscent of an army of insects covering their prey within a matter of minutes. Other changes were introduced into the zombie characteristics, much like in the Danny Boyle English apocalypse, which help redefine the foe into intriguing new directions and thus allowing for new dramatic developments as far the genre is concerned. The relatively enormous budget also affords Marc Forster space for some spectacular scenes with swarms of zombies roaming countrysides, cities and bringing utter havoc on never before seen scales. Forster however also gives time and space for more low-key encounters with zombies, mixing it up so as to avoid repetition. At times the movie is rampant and furious, but also has the capacity to feel confined, slowly building tension and heightened expectations, especially towards the more toned down final act of the movie.Despite the accolades for the overall movie itself, several thorns do stick out, gauchely pricking the wrong nerves. This includes several plot holes, whereas the most apparent is the suggestion that the plague was dispersed across the world via air-planes. However given that the sickness incubates for mere minutes, this just isn't feasible. Instead a scenario more akin to that of Ebola is likely - the virus spreads with such deadly intensity and at such a rate, that the sickness has no time to spread vastly. Another troublesome issue regards the whitewashing of the racist apartheid state of Israel, which is presented as a welcoming, open country with the walls being constructed solely for the purpose of preventing such a zombie onslaught. And not for the purpose of ethnic cleansing as is the reality (scenes of Palestinians and Jews idyllically singing in joy of reunification were uncomfortably out-of-order). Brings into question how much cash the Israeli government flung at the movie to present them as doves of peace...Nonetheless, despite these flaws ""World War Z"" presents itself as another strong zombie movie of the year (after ""Warm Bodies"") and a must-watch summer flick.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Subtle suggestions that Israel is a oasis of intelligence and compassion whereas all other countries are bumbling idiots or brutes. Wall they built is really built to save humanity. This subtle propaganda does work and I am sure lot of people's existing biases will be confirmed.Brad Pitt was not convincing in his role. Other characters were fairly weak too.

Chaos and mayhem ensues, and its all done with a great sense of pace and style. Special effects are stunning, and look real. They don't have the ""fakey"" look like so many of CGI does these days in most movies. It is a real summer blockbuster popcorn type movie.The ending is unfortunately a let down, and everything slows way down with a much too long scene set in a disease research facility. But for most of the movie, it is a thrilling roller coaster ride with superb special effects and a mercurial pace. Brad Pitt is excellent in the reluctant hero lead role, and this is the first time I have really liked him in a movie since ""12 Monkeys"". And that is good, because he is on screen most of the time and in just about every scene, and carries the movie. The other characters all have minor roles, but the actors do well with what they are given. An atmospheric soundtrack adds just the right touch.

Maybe that is a good thing. I waited to see something familiar from the book, but perhaps it is better this way. This is not a bad movie at all. Even the story is quite coarse and ending is downright lame it doesn't bother too much. Good entertainment after all. This movie is not typical zombie movie. Lack of all grotesque mauling and killing is missing here. Reason for that must be movie huge production budget. It just simply needs to get enough viewers to cover at least that massive production value. U.S. PG13 sounds much rational than local Finnish age limit of 16.

I was also very impressed with Brad pitt's acting. However the ending wasn't so good, they could have ended it much better and there could of been a bit more action in the film. Overall this film was a good surprising summer action film. And not being the perfect movie, with the ending it shows that there's much room for improvement if we were to see a sequel.I was going to give this film a 3&1/2 star rating, but when I think back to the amazing opening scenes, this film deserves a rating of4 Stars out of 5. (8/10)*However if your a fan of the book, you will be disappointed.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

"8","/10","""World War Z"" is ""The Walking Dead"" on a global scale - and even more frightening!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3191193/?ref_=tt_urv","CleveMan66","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17590531/?ref_=tt_urv","24 February 2015","An ordinary day in Philadelphia becomes a horrifying fight for survival in a matter of minutes.okay, maybe that's not too unusual, but in a matter of days, people are confined to a few islands of humanity where the walls seem to be closing in and no one is really safe. ""World War Z"" is truly frightening.It all starts with the best shot, best edited most heart-pounding opening credits I've ever seen (yes, I said opening credits) and it just builds in intensity from there. Zombies have been scaring movie audiences for decades, and, more recently, TV audiences as well, but never like this. This film is like an episode of ""The Walking Dead"" on crack. These zombies move much faster than most of the zombies you've seen on TV or in the movies and they work together in ways that make you believe that mankind is indeed doomed. Still, the movie balances the action and sense of dread with a humanity that is lacking in many zombie tales. As in most zombie stories, a bite from a zombie quickly turns a healthy human into one of the undead, and a shot or severe blow to the head is the only way to really stop them, but as lethal as these zombies are, they have a weakness.""World War Z"" star Brad Pitt, in a subtle, but intense performance, plays a former United Nations employee and man-of-many talents who is brought back into the fold to help figure out how this whole thing started. Pitt's character is smart, resourceful and absolutely determined to do anything he can to save the world, but mainly as a way to save his own family who waits for his return on a ship at sea. He embarks on a perilous around-the-world trek following clues and putting himself at greater and greater risk to prevent the apparently imminent extinction of the human race.The movie comes to an end, but the story's ending isn't so neat. That's not a criticism. It's an example of what this film does very well – make the audience feel that if there were a zombie apocalypse, this is really what it might be like. One man living through and accomplishing everything that Pitt's character survives and does in this film makes him come off a little too much like a superhero, but it sure is thrilling to be along for the ride. I give ""World War Z"" an ""A-"".","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

This doesn't mean the movie was completely bad, the acting was on par, and action scenes were tense and thrilling. However, good acting and descent action scenes cannot compensate for a lack of originality and a lazily written plot. My main issue with this movie was how little I cared about the fates of each character. While the actors did a good job making the characters seem believable, there was not enough work done on the writers' side to develop the characters and make me want to care for their survival. If you can ignore the predictable plot, cheesy clichés, and uninteresting characters, World War Z becomes a mediocre zombie flick.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

Pitt is fine in his role but his portrayal is meaningless as we really have no idea who his character is. He formerly operated for the U.N. and is a family man at heart, that's about it. He lacks any real strengths or any real weaknesses, he pretty much just avoids ""zombies"" the entire movie and uses common sense to find a cure. I also thought a lot of the CGI used in this movie was poorly done, and often unnecessary in my opinion. Another issue I had with this film was the ""zombies"", these things are not zombies, if anything they are vampires. We never see them actually devour anyone, in fact all they do is bite people and then proceed to infect others, like vampires only these ones don't mind the sun. This film is no doubt hindered by its rating, who's idea was it to make a zombie movie without blood? This is not a zombie movie, this is an over-produced, uninspired CGI vampire-infested waste of time.","12 out of 30 found this helpful.

World War Z touted as the most expensive Zombie film , does lives up to to much and hoopla surrounding it.As the entire world is hit by a plague, Zombies are becoming more ferocious and scattered. UN employee Gerry Lane must travel to the crux of the situation and prevent the disease from spreading to untouched location.From the critical acclaim films like Kite Runner and Stranger Than Fiction , Marc Foster goes out of his comfort zone and takes one step further into an unexplored area. From the very first scene, he goes in the main subject and shows how Zombies are attacking the innocent people and eventually the disease is spreading to other continents. The best among all these scenes was the attack shown in Israel. I would consider to be one of the highlight of the film. Another good thing about the film is they show how to camouflage the dead people and escape from them. Kudos to the director and story teller. Screenplay is extremely engaging and editing is tight. Special mention to art direction and cinematography. The only thing where I felt the movie could do better was the less-impacting. It is Brad Pitt who takes the entire film on his shoulder. Though the visual effects driven film does not have much scope of acting , Pitt is expressive and does a fine job.World War Z is engaging , thrilling and stunning.

And the subject matter turned out to be so viable, no matter how applicable it sounded in this context, but, the story came to life, and to this day, the horror carried by the countless army of the dead continues to make its way to the still beating hearts.One of these impressions was the rather high-grossing motion picture ""War of the Worlds Z"" starring Brad Pitt, who, despite his stellar status, did not manifest himself very much in this kind of film industry. But it was all the more interesting to look at the magnificent coldness of the actor, in a world where the end of a significant stay reigns at that moment.""The War of the Worlds Z"" demonstrates a rather familiar situation, where there is an initial problem, a path for its possible resolution, and actually a boundary at which a glimmer of hope is visible. Which, of course, does not deny the continuation in the future, because such films have their own response in the mass, the example of ""Resident Evil"" is indicative. By the way"" ""War of the Worlds Z"" looks decent from the point of view of high-quality visualization.To talk about any meaning presented in the film means to push your wandering ship onto the reef of denial. This is a spectacular movie, in fact, having no mental background, except for the actual movement of society towards the logical conclusion of its life cycle, albeit not so noticeable. The demonstrativeness with which the world is drowning in dead chaos is the main message to humanity, which has every chance to be at the real end of its existence, and to see how the world collapsed, to which great efforts were made.It is worth noting that the movie ""War of the Worlds Z"" in modern cinema was created in a canonical way, unfortunately, the distinctiveness that was in such films is very limited. And if the creators are looking for any chance that their creation will leave a mark in history, then in this case, it swept along with the terrible howl with which zombies plunged the world into the darkness of existence.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Directed by Marc Forster (QUANTUM OF SOLACE 2008, 7/10; STRANGER THAN FICTION 2006, 7/10; STAY 2005, 8/10; FINDING NEVERLAND 2004, 7/10; MONSTER'S BALL 2001, 7/10), who is to some extent oscillating between a major company's hack and an accomplished auteur in the indiewood. WORLD WAR Z craftily grafts mind-blowing visual feasts onto an apocalyptic milieu with rapid-running zombies infected by unknown virus, and keep contaminating the residual humankind. The backstory sounds familiar but film constructs an alternative coda, not the hackneyed one-man-saves-the-world heroism, instead, it offers a more plausible expedient to both avoid the callow overkill and underscore the future with a bleaker hope for the story to continue. The film never stray from a standard zombiefest routine, but the execution is commendable, an indeed white-knuckle experience from A to Z, the process of this prerogative family's running away from a zombie-invading Philadelphia has been handled even-handedly, although Pitt's wife and daughters would only be the burden for his further mission. Bounding from South Korea to Jerusalem, then a considerably smaller-scaled finale inside a secular lab in Scotland, the film brings us a gripping journey but there is no superhero to save mankind. In the South Korea chapter, an unexpected self-shooting accident happens out of the left field, in view of the executor's seemingly essential role as the last straw to stop this mess. This is a wonderful surprise I don't mind watching more on screens nowadays. Moreover, the treatment of silence is another feat creatively applied here, pretty contrasts to the common hubbub in the action pack, but as a corollary, there will be an inconvenient silence-breaker thanks to the unwitting wife's timely call, otherwise, the act is too smooth and casualties can never be spared in this case (farewell, James Badge Dale). However, the pinnacle no doubt should attribute to the raiding of City of David, excellent airborne shots render viewers a stately sacredness to witness the havoc, a sarcastic indication of a rabble of Muslims hymning cheerfully would insanely precipitate zombies to rally outside the bulwarks and eventually break into the city thanks to their umpteen quantities, which is a tad offensive but from the prospect of a non-believer, the irony is a bonanza since we are in desperation for some gallows humor under the circumstances.Most dissenters would argue the reshoot of the final act (an original plan includes a massive combat sets in Moscow) is a letdown simply because it is not epic enough to culminate the prescribed ""the bigger the better"" adrenaline drive, nevertheless, this thriftier approach options a no-gut-no-glory scheme which turns out to be a fairly conducted indoor thriller, and one can even laugh about the ostentatious plugging of the beverage company during the revelational discovery. The cast is inherently viable, Pitt underplays his charisma to be more approachable, it is rather comforting to see Enos clench a major film role and she could have been a better fighter than her screen hubby. In a nutshell, WORLD WAR Z is an entertaining popcorn fare, and doesn't try to patronize and outsmart its audience and showboats its CGI stunts to offer a bombarding sense of instantaneous grandiosity, which ultimately will fall bland in aftertaste. This alone can make most tentpoles pale in comparison!","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I think the majority of the negative reviews are complaints that the plot does not follow that of the book - I have never seen a film yet that matches or betters a book, a book lets the reader use their imagination and is almost a personal interpretation of events, a movie certainly is not. The film does not give a detailed explanation of how the virus is created but more focuses on the aftermath and the race to find a cure. It opens with a fairly dramatic car crash sequence and the pace of the movie never really drops as Pitt travels the globe searching for an answer. The plot has holes big enough to fly a jumbo jet through - such as how can a military plane fly from Korea to Israel without stopping for fuel ? The Israel section is where the majority of the CGI effects take place and is particularly impressive during the city siege.

They're not only fleet of foot but are able to scale seemingly impenetrable walls by piling one on top of the other like a cheerleader pyramid on steroids (in their speed, they actually have more in common with the creatures in the ""24 Days Later"" series). This may make them a lot harder to outrun, but it robs them of some of the creepiness we normally associate with the zombie figure.Because the movie is done on a global rather than intimate scale, it lacks the haunting, soul-searing dread and emotional desolation of a work like ""The Walking Dead."" In contrast, ""Z"" feels more like a grand action movie but, even as such, it hits all the right notes. Thanks to Brooks' beat-the-clock scenario (adapted herein by Matthew Michael Carnahan, Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof) and Marc Foster's full-throttle direction, the audience rarely gets the chance to relax the muscles, as we hurtle right along with Pitt from one close-call encounter with a baffling, seemingly intractable enemy to the next.Not all that memorable really, but entertaining while it's going on.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A different perspective on the zombie genre that works!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2899250/?ref_=tt_urv","stachows","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur47819628/?ref_=tt_urv","3 November 2013","When I saw this movie was coming out, I didn't really want to see it because I felt I had enough of big blockbuster zombie movies for one lifetime, but when I finally did get to see it I found it really different from other zombie movies out there. There were several differences in the movie ""World War Z"", differences that sets the film apart from others such as ""Dawn of the Dead"", ""Resident Evil"" and the classic that started it all, ""Night of the Living Dead."" ""World War Z""stars Brad Pitt as a United Nation hotshot (Gerry Lane) who is living with his family when the zombie outbreak begins in the heart of Philadelphia. Utter chaos ensues as the living dead take over and begin to turn frightened humans into an exponentially growing hoard of the walking dead. Due to his prowess and skills learned through years with the U.N, Gerry gets his family to safety and then embarks on a journey to find the cause of the virus and stop the pandemic. ""WWZ"" stands out among all of the other zombie movies because the film is not about surviving the zombie apocalypse and the degradation of society once every human is fighting for their own survival. ""WWZ"" takes the audience on a journey of attempting to understand how a pandemic of this magnitude is possible in the present, and begs not the ""What do we do from here?"" question, but ""Where did this come from, how can we stop it?"" making the plot of ""WWZ"" extremely intriguing. In most zombie films, the only way to deal with living dead is to completely destroy all brain activity in the ghoul, whether it be from a shotgun shell to the head, decapitation, or severing the spinal cord. ""WWZ"" however, uses a scientific/detective- like search for a cure or vaccine to undead virus and in the end uses an ingenious way to fool zombies into not attacking living flesh. In this way, ""WWZ"" brilliantly flips the art of avoiding zombies on its head. But, a lot of people out there criticize this movie because it had nothing to do with Max Brook's book with the same title. In ""World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War"", Max Brooks writes of several tales, happening all around the world, interwoven with each other as society tries to survive the living dead. There is no solid plot line, no connection of stories with each other and no real beginning or end- a great fiction read. The intentions of the film ""WWZ"" were to provide a plot and center on one character and the journey through the pandemic. One cannot compare the two, or criticize for their lack of similarity because they are two different pieces of work. ""WWZ"" was not an attempt to adapt the book, merely using the book as a guideline and for the name, which in itself sparked major interest. In the end, the movie ""World War Z"" gives a refreshing take on the zombie genre and may lead to possibilities that have not yet been explored. Simple twists to the zombie apocalypse framework of hundreds of movies before, creates a different, highly profitable and more relatable horror movie reaching a higher number of movie watchers than ever before. The film should not be discounted because of its name and relation to a fiction novel, but should be viewed on its own as the instant classic and welcomed addiction to any zombie movie collection. See it!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"3","/10","All The Potential, None Of It Realized","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2822709/?ref_=tt_urv","CashFunky007","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur44640646/?ref_=tt_urv","30 June 2013","'World War Z' could have been one of the best Zombie movies ever. It has an almost intimidating line-up of talent before and behind the camera, it is based on a best- selling novel and the makers reached very deep into their pockets to break Zombie havoc out of its usual local confinement to go and create mayhem on a global scale. But the film-makers failed on every count. And this is not about the controversy regarding the unfaithful rendering of Max Brooks' novel. Yes, the movie 'World War Z' essentially discards the basic concept of the book 'World War Z'. But even when fully acknowledged that a film is a work in its own right, the movie is still a failure. Although the pitch sounded so promising. Zombie movies so far have been local affairs. 'Dawn of the Dead' depicted the Zombie epidemic somewhere in rural America, 'The Walking Dead' maraud in backwater Alabama., '28 Days/Weeks Later' take place in and around London. So it's fair to assume that we all have been waiting long and eagerly for a movie that deals with the Zombie epidemic on a global scale. So, what 'World War Z' could have been is a thrilling and scary genre movie with a gripping premise, compelling characters and stunning visuals of global Zombie disaster. And it could have explored a multitude of grand themes. What makes us human? How do we maintain human kindness in the face of global destruction? At what point do we allow the veneer of civilization to break and give way to chaos and barbarism? Unfortunately the movie leaves all this potential unrealized.The protagonists are two dimensional and wooden, I can't remember having ever seen Brad Pitt so stiff and awkward. His character Gerry Lane is introduced as one of the best UN investigators there are and it is this alleged aptitude that puts him as the main character. What earned him this reputation remains unclear throughout the entire movie though. He never shows particular investigative skills, nor does he shine by asking incredibly smart questions that nail it all down. He rather stumbles through the plot holes and follows even the vaguest hints as an excuse to traverse the globe. At one point this gets right out ridiculous when Gerry accidentally runs into a prisoner with some obvious mental problems, and that nutcase prisoner says something along the lines of 'There is a man in the Middle East who might know something', and Brad Pitt's ""best UN investigator"" goes 'Yeah right, let's go to the Middle East then'. Wow, this is really poor screen writing. Probably the most engaging aspect of a movie with the premise of 'World War Z' would be for the viewer to witness how humankind struggles to maintain humanity and how this becomes increasingly harder as civilization gradually dissolves into chaos and death. Well, this aspect really is engaging - but you won't find it explored in this movie. There are only two scenes where this theme is latently addressed, one of which has the wife and kids of Brad Pitt's character facing dismissal from a safe refuge. But neither do we see the wife fighting her and her children's deportation, nor do we get to watch the politicians vindicate their inhumane decision. We don't get a glimpse on what this decision does to her or her little children or even Brad Pitt's character. What could have been an engaging, emotional, highly dramatic and as well as frightening part of the movie is simply omitted. You might think you could live with all these flaws as long as this Zombie movie delivers on its primal promise - Zombie thrills abundantly. Think again. Aside from the fact that 'World War Z's PG-13 rating forecloses any Zombie gore the movie fails to create any characteristics you'd normally affiliate with the genre. No white knuckle moments, no jumping in your seat, no claustrophobia, not the faintest signs of decent suspense. The human-vs.-Zombie-moments create a permanent sense of déjà-vu. Be it humans running and Zombies closing in, be it a door with tons of Zombies on the outside about to run it in, be it humans slowly running out of ammo as the Zombie hordes keep surging. You know you've seen 'em all in other movies, only that they were far better in those other movies. The few redeeming qualities of the film – and why I give it three stars - are a couple of compelling CGI shots of major cities in ruin and the nature of the Zombies which act like an unstoppable, hyper-fast, hyper-frenzied swarm of locusts.All in all the movie 'World War Z' is a weak and astonishingly uninspired affair.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Sure there is flaws but the good definitely outways the bad. If your complaining about Brad pitt kicking zombie ass your crazy.I will admit the plot and the script was kind of on the weaker side but I'd argue that this movie being so visually pleasing makes up for it. While it's not necessarily scary it is intense and very eerie and action packed which is how a zombie movie should be. I've seen a lot of people complaining about the third act but I really don't see it. I do think it was a great way to end the movie.

It is as if the movie was a set up for a second movie and THAT movie would be the one that I was expecting. This one was just a cliché, remake of most every Zombie movie made.......except Zombie Land which had comedy and is worth watching.And, Zombie-ism aside, anyone that has studied science beyond the 7th grade will be baffled by most of the outcomes, plot, and decisions; biological, physical, and militarily too. I'll spare the details of these as they would be spoilers but you will see them march across the screen left and right. I look for actual plausibility in a sci-fi action flick....like Jurassic Park or the original War of the Worlds. This is miles from that. Even in the fore-mentioned Zombie Land, which I would classify in a different genre; if one could get over the Zombie-ism...it was plausible. This movie was more Brad Pitt being sought out as the only man on earth that could do any deductive reasoning and then was able to somehow make the conclusion that (and this is a metaphor) that 4+8=26. Sorry, but you will have to watch the show to see what I mean by that metaphor but his and the movie's conclusion follows that line of logic.","15 out of 41 found this helpful.

"5","/10","Not boring at all, but neither deep or intense","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2817728/?ref_=tt_urv","MandarinaMelies","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur38700977/?ref_=tt_urv","22 June 2013","Before my review, I state that Zombie-movies fans will not like this film.World War Z achieves success from the beginning at establishing the apocalyptic climate, and settling it's own plausibility (you believe the Zombie issue). Then you have a good Plot for making Gerry (Pitt's character) ""the one"" (he must protect a scientist at his trip looking for the origin of the virus). But soon the scientist gets out of the center of the scene and it becomes not very serious the fact that Gerry has to solve everything by himself (his body, his brain).From that moment, the movie has several nice scenes of zombie hordes attacking people (you feel like in a PS3 Zombies video game; by the way, I guess they are launching it soon). But the search for answers remains the central objective, which is a plus for the film.The PEPSI hired spot is too evident and is during the Climax sequence, which is annoying.The solution Gerry finds to contain the Zombie invasion is smart and interesting for the Plot. Extremely sharper than the silly climax resources used in ""Signs"", ""Transformers"", ""Independence Day"" and ""War of the Worlds""). However the last 4 minutes after that are dull.To sum up: good colossal scenes; great main idea of the story; poor character development; no deep emotions involved (neither the audience nor the characters); the wife and mom is just a wife and mom, which remembers the Hollywood of the '40s; obvious expository dialogues; failed and contradictory political subtext; a fun story overall. And, last but not least, the 3D provides absolutely nothing to this movie, by the contrary, it's distracting. Hollywood should control his 3D fetish.The most interesting: The comment about the ""Social Engineering"" solution in North Korea; the ""Tenth Man method"" in Israel; most of the movie happens outside the USA; the black woman zombie at the Lab; the scene where two scientists look like zombies.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

But considering most zombie flick fans want to see some gore, this PG-13 outing is decidedly and significantly sub-par. I would never recommend this film to any zombie film fan. 3.5/10As an adaptation of a pretty interesting book, World War Z is an utter and complete failure, sharing absolutely nothing with the book except for the name and the fact that it has zombies in it. The book is worlds better in every imaginable way. 1/10Overall it's a pretty crap film, but I'll give the usual caveat that if you're the kind of filmgoer who just wants to turn your brain off and watch some silly action for a few hours... Well, even some of the CG is pretty crap, but from the other reviews it looks like some people are enjoying it as a senseless random action film.

"5","/10","World War Z has sufficient teeth to entertain you with zombie-led thrills, but its bloodless bite marks will disappear before the ending credits are done","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2816623/?ref_=tt_urv","moviexclusive","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23415028/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2013","It's seldom a good sign when gossip about a movie spreads before you get wind of a proper synopsis or catch a peek of the trailer. The genesis of World War Z began six years ago when Brad Pitt's production company bought the rights to Max Brooks's bestselling novel of the same name. Controversy has since been fuelled by rumours of repeated script rewrites, reshoots, costly action scenes and an army of extras, all of which supposedly ballooned costs to over $200 million (check out Vanity Fair's detailed chronology of the drama here). Contrast that to another film in the same genre, Danny Boyle's 2002 critical success 28 Days Later, which had an estimated budget of US$8 million.So expectations are high for World War Z, which many may know as 'The Brad Pitt vs zombies show'. Directed by Marc Forster (Quantum of Solace, Finding Neverland), Pitt headlines as Gerry Lane, a family man / prized ex-United Nations investigator who gets a ticket out of hell when an unknown virus breaks out in his hometown of Philadelphia. It's contagious among humans, needing just a minimum of 12 seconds to transform a functional human to a mindless zombie with the athleticism of an Olympic sprinter, sensitive to both sound and visual contact. The UN requires Gerry's expertise and in exchange offers refuge aboard a vessel in the middle of the Atlantic. With his wife Karin (Mireille Enos) and two daughters in tow, he flees via helicopter after a heart- thumping escape from a swarm of infected chasing them through an apartment stairwell onto the rooftop.Entrusted with the goal of locating the mysterious source of virus outbreak (otherwise known as 'patient zero') in the hope of finding a cure, Gerry unwillingly leaves his family behind and sets off on an international hunt for clues. Every step of the way is plagued with misfortune and accident – some so predictable and trite that you wonder if it was intended to be humorous. After a luckless stopover at South Korea, he looks for answers in Israel, a country that completed walling itself in just before the outbreak. Just as Gerry gets limited information from a Mossad head, the sanctuary transforms into a torture chamber when the infected masses crawl in, ant horde-like, lured by echoes of celebratory singing. Hubris has no place in a zombie apocalypse. In the middle of a nail-biting escape, genius strikes as Gerry pieces his observations together to form a hypothesis on a possible cure Testing and executing it, however, will require an extraordinary dose of luck, good fitness, and a WHO laboratory.Forster's World War Z is targeted at the mass audience and is possibly one of the least gory zombie outings in recent times. The crazed infected horde flawlessly demonstrates mindless herd mentality and despite being noticeably CG (unlike the uber-realistic ones in AMC's The Walking Dead), they're easily the scene-stealers. The script is sparse and loose, occasionally borderline sexist. The story busies itself with demonstrating Murphy's Law, throwing out crisis after crisis but rendering each character a level of development that is barely skin- deep. Gerry has little space to emote, and perhaps it is the material that limits Pitt from displaying his characteristic spark so evident in previous outings such as Inglourious Basterds, Fight Club and the Ocean's franchise.The zombie apocalypse is an arguably overused premise, yet still commands rabid obsession among pop culture fanatics. It's been explored in books, on TV and of course the big screen: the all-important 1968 horror film Night of the Living Dead set the tone for cinema. But today, the zombie genre only truly works when it is at its most contemplative, serving as a reflection of ethical, moral and emotional dilemmas or as political commentary. And here's where World War Z falters in mid- sprint: it is entertainment that is exciting, but essentially empty. -www.moviexclusive.com","15 out of 42 found this helpful.

In this case, I listened to a good portion of the audio book. I could recognize, as with the majority of books, that it is not appropriate to compare two different forms of entertainment. A book can expand in situations that a movie has no time for. What a good screenplay can do, is flesh out some of the better characters, and inject them into the storyline somehow that works with the overall arc of the movie. This is true as our protagonist meets characters in South Korea and Israel. But the overall arc of the movie was not satisfying. The movie stayed too conventional, setting up the family, and making the film about getting safely back to the family. Important as this is, the detective work in tracing the source of a virus and solving the epidemic should also be given great weight in the story. Such is not the case in this film. It is, however, a successful achievement in how the story allows chaos to help dictate the direction. When things don't go as planned, then you prevent the audience from predicting the outcome, something we are starving for. The final summary of this review is like so many other blockbusters recently. The most noticeable problem with this film, one big enough for me to not recommend this film, is the PG-13 instead of R rating for a horror movie. Worse, it seems obvious the movie could have been edited a lot scarier, but pulled it's punches at the moment of the big shock. Playing it too safe at every scary moment goes against the very point of the genre. With the moment of thrill being sanitised, you no longer have any expectation of being subjected to a scary film, and now just sit there as we miss all the good action off camera. Which takes us to the infamous third act. A great deal of publicity has been released about the reshoot of the third act, and the new ending feels tossed together at the last minute. At this point I was yawning and felt no scary thrills from our group of harmless zombies. There was a lot of laughter in the theatre throughout the supposed nail biting climax. And the homogenised storyline all but assured the telegraphed ending. So you have the conventional close to the film, but no. Sequel bait dictates that the story is not over, that all the efforts we have endured could be meaningless. This was an unsatisfying non-closure, and was ready for the credits to roll and head to the exit. I recommend waiting for the DVD, enjoy the action setpieces, and lament at the much scarier film it could have been.","13 out of 36 found this helpful.

Movie is not scary, but is thrilling enough. Characters are good and we care for them. Pitt's character isn't some macho ""I'm gonna save the world"" jackass, but just a normal man with weaknesses and fears. When I heard about this movie, I just thought it's excuse to see Brad Pitt look cool while running away from a zombie horde. Well, I couldn't have been more wrong. Pacing is great and to move from Romero's nihilistic view on the apocalypse is a breath of fresh air. The movie gives hope. Inspires. And features great performances all over the board. I don't say it's perfect. Movie is great at showing chaos, but even Hollywood stumbles when showing this much stuff. Personally, I think movie could be even longer, so we get to feel the main character's struggle. This way the solving of a problem seems so natural and easy. Still, you can't have it all. 8/10!

Slow, limbering and relentless creatures getting mowed down by a group of survivors with a host of different weapons and insane amounts of gore and violence to go with probably a pretty crappy story. Well at least that's what I think of. My expectations for World War Z were fairly high, despite not ever reading the book. Well what I expected and what was presented was very different, and World War Z changes the game and the way you think of zombie movies.The first thing that caught my attention was the PG-13 rating. As I mentioned, when I see a zombie themed movie I initially expect heavy blood and violence but it was clear right before the first scene that WWZ was going in a different direction. Instead of over-the-top violence, WWZ gets its thrills through mystery and the adaptive smarts of the lead characters through several extremely tense moments. There are the occasional traditional zombie action, where we see zombies being gunned down by the dozen, but they usually cut away quick and involve little to zero gore. However, the sheer scale of this zombie pandemic is enough to keep you entertained. At first I thought that the film missed out on some brutal action scenes that would make the movie more realistic and intense, but in retrospect, I feel as heavy gore would have taken away from what the movie was really about; the mystery of the pandemic's origin and the race against time to discover a cure.Brad Pitt leads the cast as Gerry Lane, a former United Nations employee who is fighting to keep his family alive after a global zombie infection strikes leaving the world at it's knees. Eventually, Gerry is forced back into action and starts a mission that takes him around the globe in order to find where the infection started and if there is a cure. The plot is pretty straight forward, but what makes this movie unlike others of it's undead kind, is the pressure of finding a cure before the entire planet is lost. As stated, the mystery takes center stage rather than a pure survival story. While there are some plot holes, including some predictable moments, the story as a whole is solid.Now to the undead. Zombies have been portrayed on numerous different forms over the years and in WWZ, they are terrifying. While they maintain some characteristics of classic zombies, like being very sensitive to noise, these zombies are brutally fast and large groups can devastate even the strongest forces. These types of zombies fare well in creating some thrilling scenes where escape is the only option. While some parts are predictable, the action sequences are exciting and powerful and the fast paced zombie style adds to that sense of vulnerability and urgency that a human might not make it out in time.The cast is decent, lead by the aforementioned Brad Pitt. Pitt's character is really the only one who we really get to know well,and this is largely because Pitt gets nearly 100 percent of the screen, which isn't bad. Daniella Kertesz displays a strong female role as Segen, but doesn't develop enough to have real depth. Gerry's family doesn't get too deep either, but their presence in the opening of the film gives a larger sense of possible loss and puts more tension behind them trying to escape. Overall, the cast is incomplete and the movie suffers from poor character development, but Brad Pitt shines in the starring role.World War Z without a doubt changes the way zombie themed movies are viewed. No longer do the undead have to be involved with absurd amounts of violence and gore. With WWZ, the rules are changed by creating a race against time thriller with the zombie sticker on it. Despite some plot issues and a mostly weak cast of characters, the high-level action scenes of adaptive tactics and escape from the undead will have you holding your breath, especially the highlight scene near the end of the movie.The zombie apocalypse has evolved, and for the most part, it as evolved for the better in World War Z.8.5/10","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

This was an opportunity completely blown to make this into a political/social metaphor commentary, as District 9 has done for alien films, but ""Hollywood"" (and Pitt) chose to make it nothing more than an effects-driven, mainstream, unintelligent, shallow, ""nothing better to watch"", forgettable, summer budget-buster (like ""The Avengers""). Such a waste of time and money. Ironic how Pitt is making worse movies, while Jolie is making better ones.

I mean yes, it was a good action film with some incredibly scary parts but overall it failed to deliver on the basis of stupidity. The basis of a lack of common sense, human ingenuity and a proper storyline. The script seemed rushed and the acting was reasonable but not for a film of this height. This deserved more and the filmmakers know it, as they haven't followed up with a sequel despite this quite clearly being a cash cow.I've given it a 9 on the basis that it's enjoyable but don't expect much more.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The supposed special forces are so incompetent they make Andrea from Walking Dead look like a hotshot A-list Zombie killer.If you have never seen a zombie movie, ever, in your life, then maybe, possibly, you wouldn't mind this. Or if you hate gore, violence, suspense or general horror in your horror movies; if you've been on the hunt for a nice, family friendly zombie action flick; or if you want some 3D Brad Pitt and don't really need or want any plot or character development, then this is for you.Otherwise, it's a boring waste of money. Wait for it to come out on TV next year. Don't even spend money on the DVD.I don't understand how a movie can be this bad in 2013 when the ""zombie infestation and how to survive it"" genre has almost been perfected. This might have cut it if it had been released around 2000, 2003 for the latest. Even zombie movie parodies try harder than this movie did. It reeks of laziness, and I mean come on, the bar is set pretty low for zombie movies as it is. 1 star because it stars Brad Pitt and he has a cool, Nicholas Cagey hairstyle. 2nd star for the silent sidekick girl.","17 out of 51 found this helpful.

When I watch a film I want to be entertained and see a film that makes me laugh or at least make me feel good. There were films last year about the end of the world and now its all about after the end of the world. They make films showing violence and then wonder why kids go out shooting and killing people. Its about time we banned these films. People who like these films are sick in my opinion.

The first is that although I loved the book, I have no qualms with a movie that diverges completely from the source material. The second is that I have nothing at all against PG-13 horror movies. While I see countless fellow horror fans complaining about PG-13s, some of my favorite (and personally most terrifying) horror movies have had that rating (The Others, The Ring, Skeleton Key, Jaws etc.)I went into WWZ knowing it diverged from the book vastly and not caring if it was PG 13, all I wanted was some half decent entertainment. Unfortunately, this film played it so safe that it was terminally dull - and I don't mean in terms of having no gore, I mean in terms of not being willing to take one single risk in the script. There's simply *nothing* here that wasn't, at best, obvious; or, at worst, dumb. It's one of those films where you figure out what the protagonist has to figure out looooong before he does so, then spend the rest of the film clock watching and waiting for him to have the a-ha moment. Sometimes those kind of films can be saved by fascinating character arcs, or perhaps by some interesting cinematography or direction or even by a rousing score, but again WWZ plays it horribly safe in all those aspects too. Not one moment of the music will stay in your head, not one shot will make you think ""nicely framed"", not one character will have you saying ""I didn't know they were going to say that"".I can only imagine the things that went on behind the scenes to make this so horribly mundane. I suspect it involved a great deal of high level pressure to make it inoffensive enough to market to teenagers. But here's the thing - the very subject matter of the dead returning to life requires, nay *demands*, boldness - not necessarily gore or violence, but at the very least BOLDNESS - yet WWZ is as meek as a movie can get. You could show it to your Grandmother over tea and biscuits and she'd probably be just as bored as you would and forget everything that happened just as fast.I'm a big fan of Pitt. Usually he has the intensity to pull even a weak movie up to higher levels - but not so here. His character is the safest of the bunch, a doting dad with nary a flaw in sight. He wanders, set-jawed and honorable, from location to location without his character experiencing a single moment of intensity, internal conflict, or weakness. WWZ is a beige wall, it's a light gray cardigan, it's a glass of room temperature water, it's a placebo sugar pill. It won't offend you, excite you, upset you, fascinate you, thrill you or scare you in any way. It will enter your system and leave without trace or effect.","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

Given that, why do movie makers (i don't care what they call themselves) think that shaking the camera will improve the experience. I was frustrated and angry that I never really saw what was going on. I KNEW what was going because I saw the trailers and ads. I understood the action because Brad is running around and there's a lot of noise..... However, this is a MOVIE not a radio show. That means I want to SEE what is going on. I have five senses and a movie engages two of them, not one. I do not get a feeling of ""intensity"" or ""suspense"" by not seeing clearly, I get ""upset"" (to use polite language).

The zombies are really fast and quite scary, so you will have few jump scares here and there.

Especially the scenes that want to focus on the sound effects used to tell the story. Such as the scene of a car crash at the beginning of the story or the transformation from a human to a zombie.Narrow visual style, the music has a fast tempo, and on the other hand, in the wide picture, the music has a slower tempo and the composition of the instruments sounds larger and more intense.The scenes that require emotional thrills, the energy of the stringed instruments is used by playing them in high-frequency ratios, such as double treble proportions or three syllable proportions.The percussion sector, it focuses on the head of the room or some rhythm. Which results in the sound being not too messy.In scenes with characters' words in an underscore arrangement, low tones are used so as not to disturb the characters' speech. And if it's an exciting scene with characters speaking with a drum percussion instrument, the sound will be mixed, cutting the high frequencies out to only the low frequencies.Scenes requiring whisper silence don't necessarily have music, and when the sudden onslaught of events happens, the music will. It can affect many feelings.The piano radiates hope and takes on the feeling of moving on in the setting. The helicopter landed on the boat.During the farewell of the characters there is a dialogue that is touching, the music is in a smooth, long melody that envelops the dialogue without interruption. Have a unique musical instrument sound design or sound palette.Wide shots scene Traveling, especially the scenes that are connected to each body, will use the main theme to mask that scene.Use a high-pitched whistle to speak. That an unfortunate event is about to occur in order to prepare the audience's feelings before leading to a thrilling event Use the sound of explosions to cut the music.The moment the characters feel that they are nemesis or the job is done, that's where the music begins.In the ending, it is noticeable that once the mission is accomplished, the music is bright, giving a sense of accomplishment, and when the characters' dialogue, the music performs an underscore with a shift from a full orchestral music. It's a piano, and when the characters' lines are finished, it's back to music. Full circle again.(NOTE Ratthakorn Komol, 2021)","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Well whoever decided that needs to be fed to a group of zombies because that pretty much was finished off this already suffering movie. Believe me the only little, small, tiny good thing about this film was the action scenes and giving the audience time to think and realise they're actually watching rubbish before the credits rolled was mega dumb. If your cooking up a crap fest movie fill it with action and then more action right up to the end credits, no pauses no breaks just all action that way people will look back and go 'yeah story, acting all sucked but at least the action was good.' So yeah if this film ever appears on TV I'll watch 3/4's of it then switch over. Another film to add to the list of films that could have been good.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

You've got the long-time Oscar- deserving Pitt playing Gerry Lane, a likable, good-looking family man who retired as a UN investigator to spend more time around his wife and daughters. This is all about to change obviously, because after the now seemingly mandatory news-footage-montage introduction, Gerry is called back by the UN in exchange for his family's safety on their big boat.It sounds good enough, but the problem is that WWZ's political/international context is nowhere to be found so we're left pretty much to 28 Days Later with blockbuster pretentiousness. Sure, Gerry travels around the world and makes a few long distance phone calls, but there's never anything remotely compelling enough to warrant his travels and whenever the plot does manage to come close to something it quickly sets it aside in the interest of keeping this summer blockbuster light, family friendly and internationally marketable.After Quantum of Solace there was much uncertainty about Forster's ability to direct action and after WWZ, guess what? There still is. Granted, it's never boring, but when the other elements that should've made the film aren't there it should be more than ""never boring"". Paramount's marketing certainly didn't help; if you've seen the trailers then you've seen the whole plot and LITERALLY every single action set piece, in chronological order too. You know when you see a trailer and think ""they put all the good parts in""? Well, this time they put the whole movie in. The more hardcore genre fans might also want to look elsewhere if they're seeking gory zombie kills; there isn't much of that either as its PG-13 rating might suggest.Brad Pitt is really the film's only strength. Much like Tom Cruise, Brad's got enough talent to singlehandedly pull you through a not-so- great movie without you hating him for it. And at almost age 50 you can't really blame him for wanting to star in his own big blockbuster franchise for the first time in his career when he could've played any superhero he wanted years ago. ""Franchise"" of course, if permitted by the audience, because this is one movie that desperately wants to have sequels.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

I hope that budget included production of the video games, 'cuz the movie seems like an add.If you've ever wanted to watch something which is a mix of Dawn of the Dead (with less suspense and no horror), Sean of the Dead (without the humour) and Mission Impossible (with less plot) then this is the movie for you!Some of the action was OK, Marc Forster's cinematography was sometimes fantastic and Brad Pitt (in autopilot mode) was pretty good. Shame that the result is a zombie movie which didn't focus on the zombies, a suspense thriller (without any real surprises and almost no suspense) and a comedy (unintentionally). Additionally it's based on a book with a decent social commentary message, none of which is in the movie.Perhaps the same producers will put out ""50 Shades of Grey"" next; a PG-13 rated humorous version.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

As someone pointed out in an earlier review, ""A wasted opportunity"".(SPOILER ALERT FROM HERE ON) That being said, it was better than expected and I was optimistic at the early scenes where Brad Pitt and family were stuck in traffic as all hell breaks loose around them. I even thought the use of CGI up to this point was done sparingly and very effectively, although I'm not a fan of CGI monsters (let's be honest, Computer Generated Imagery is just modern day ""claymation""). In the traffic jam sequence you couldn't tell where the zombies were coming from as they blended in from behind the panicked pedestrians. Very creepy.There were several other instances of well executed action-filled sequences that I believe would satisfy anyone looking to just be scared sh**less by fast moving zombies out to devour our beloved characters on the run. And to accomplish all this with a PG-13 rating and no blood just shows that a zombie movie need not rely on endless shots of gore to still be scary and entertaining. World War Z accomplishes this, for the most part.Unfortunately, this movie was a lot of big budget special effects surrounding a mediocre script that had me wondering if our beloved main character, played by Brad Pitt, could do no wrong. On numerous occasions Pitt's character seemed to defy the impossible and was incapable of dying in this movie when all else around him did (including a SEAL team assigned to him) which came off as a little insulting to my intelligence and far-fetched (yes, even in a zombie movie).First, there's the unexplainable escape in a borrowed RV from the downtown traffic jam as the scene simply cuts away showing Brad and family on an open road heading away from the city.Second, the fortunate escape on a commercial airliner from the city of Jerusalem when the city is overrun followed by his miraculous survival of an airplane crash (after causing the crash by throwing and surviving the hand grenade blast as he throws it toward the rear of the plane).Third, near the end of the movie he injects himself with an unknown virus selected at random from a box of biological hazards in an attempt to ""camouflage"" himself from a zombie. Forutunately, he not only selects one that doesn't kill him, but it's also the very one that disguises himself from the zombies (heavy sigh).In a nutshell, World War Z is loaded with entertaining action which I believe serves to distract from a very disappointing storyline loaded with head-shaking, ""what the f**k was that"" moments.Is is worth seeing? Sure. Worth remembering? Nope.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

Unfortunately... not. The movie and book basically have two things in common, Zombies and a U.N. employee.The most surprising aspect of the movie for me was that I found it to be boring. Something I never expected. There were some great scenes and visual images but they fell oddly flat because their outcome was never in any real doubt. Brad Pitt was not going to die early in the movie or late in the movie. His wife and children were not going to die or turn into zombies. Brad Pitt's character always, magically, no matter how unlikely, had a way out of whatever situation he was thrust into.And the third act? Totally unimaginative. Ridiculous. A cop out. Nothing to do with the book at all.Could have been a great movie.

After being saved by another UN worker who just so happens to be a Deputy Secretary General, Lane and family are put on a UN ship that has also collected far too many other refugees, and Lane is presented with a mission: re- enlist and find out the cause of the virus, or your family is going to be placed in the significantly more dangerous refugee safe zones. Brad chooses the former, and off we go. It has the feel of a really good zombie blockbuster. It has the star, the known and respected director, and the source material. I kept thinking, ""can they go wrong?"" Yes, they can. For one, they can deviate almost completely from the source material. Max Brooks's eponymous novel traced a surprisingly realistic account of what would happen should a violent global virus erupt and become a worldwide predicament. But the novel never mentioned the name of the mysterious UN negotiator conducting his investigation. It never introduced a character named ""Gerry Lane"", let alone his family. It never introduced the question; ""why did Gerry leave the UN in the first place?"" only for it to never be answered. It was much, much better that way.The problems with the film are in the script. The cast does a hit-and- miss job playing their roles but never seem to understand their lines better than the audience does. Just as Lane looks for the stem of the virus, the stem of scripted uncertainty is not in the world of World War Z but in the world of the four people who wrote it. Having more than one or two authors usually means that after the first draft, the script was circulated around and around until only faint hints of the source material are still recognizable when the movie starts filming. Lane flies all over the world, and the audience flies with him, only to find him no longer investigating but solving, shooting, and exploding.As Lane, Brad Pitt plays the role he usually plays of an only slightly less confident Brad Pitt. I kept thinking that the ending would bring about a shocking twist; he was already a zombie! Pitt shuffles through this script with all the interest of watching paint dry, and once an hour passes his ploddy performance grows weary. However forgettable his performance, I always see some of the audience uninterested in plot and only in Tyler Durden's face, so if that's why you buy your ticket, no shame. Just don't think you'll really remember who the main character is or what his mission is. As for his wife, Mirielle Enos turns in equally uninspired work as the only woman in the known world who doesn't seem to be able to create any romantic chemistry with People's Sexiest Man Alive. Following the conclusion of ABC's ""Lost"", lead star Matthew Fox could have taken any role he wanted. By now he could even have taken Pitt's role at the helm of this film. But Fox decided to take a break for a few years, and now he is reduced to playing some guy who works on a UN helicopter. He might have even had a line. David Morse, the only other American actor I recognized, plays a toothless CIA spook imprisoned in a US military base in South Korea. Morse's performance was undoubtedly the film's best. Hearing the little whistle as he spoke through his gums was chilling as you read about Edward Snowden, Bradley Manning and the like. His too-brief role emphasizes the possibilities that present themselves when you turncoat the United States. Morse alone deserves a star for his work. Effects-wise, the infected weren't anything special, but how would I know that? What does a zombie truly look like? We never found out if the infection led to death of the host and reanimation. It didn't appear that anything external was actively rotting. Some of the undead appear a bit comical, and their gangly movements were just different enough to inspire scattered laughter in the theater. Some of the best scenes of the film involved Lane traveling to Israel and Wales, the only two countries he actually manages to visit. In Jerusalem, Lane discovers that Israel has built a wall to keep the zombies out. We never get an answer to the facts behind the wall; how big is it? Is it just around Jerusalem, or the entire country of Israel? Regardless, a band of street musicians somehow manage to provoke enough ire for thousands of the undead to scale the wall and attack the city. That band must have been terrible. As a zombie is appetized by the possibility of prey, the audience is intrigued by the possibility of entertainment. The undead eat the zombie for sustenance, but quickly want to move on for more. As part of the ravenous audience, I felt the same way.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

The director done a good job with making the whole zombie situation seem real, and the effects were brilliant, but the pace of the film made it seem much longer than it was. All the way through the film it is pretty intense, unlike I Am Legend which makes you care about Will Smiths character, and of course, his dog. I think that was what was missing in this movie. Don't get me wrong, it is made very well and all of the characters put in good performances, but no one mentioned the people that they have lost which would have brought emotion to the film. In all, it's full of entertainment and intensity, but it wasn't amazing. Watchable!Round-Up: After not seeing Brad Pitt on screen for some time, due to all of the kids that he is being a daddy to, he is quite moody in this film and, in some ways, his performance didn't really stand out. It wasn't that surprising that he was playing the man who saves the world, but he could have brought some sort of emotion or wit to his role. I know that the emergency of the situation was why he was so intense, which was why Will Smith was an excellent choice for I Am Legend because he was able to mix it up. All of the other characters don't really get a chance to shine in the film because the focus is manually around Brad Pitt, even though the whole world is being swarmed by zombies. It's obvious that everyone surrounding this movie had faith in the project because of the high budget, and judging by the money that it made, you can tell that Brad Pitt can still pull in audiences, but this won't go down as a classic.Budget: $190million Worldwide Gross: $540millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there zombies movies were one man has to save the world. 5/10","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

"4","/10","Everything ""World War Z"" does well can't make up for a vapid, undeveloped script and fundamental mishandling of the zombie-horror formula...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2877874/?ref_=tt_urv","TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4669024/?ref_=tt_urv","29 September 2013","(Just a note, this review is based on the unrated cut of the film, and I have never read the original novels that inspired this release)Within 10 minutes of the Brad Pitt starring vehicle ""World War Z"", I recognized the problem. This is one of those movies that is made by a creative team that fundamentally understands the sort of film they are trying to make, and aims at their target carefully... Before turning 90 degrees away from the target and firing at random due to an awful script and the mishandling of its material. It's a film that does so much well, but tragically fails at what it sets out to do by missing that target.How does it miss that target? Well, let me explain.The film stars Brad Pitt as Gerry Lane, a former UN employee. One morning, while driving with his family (I'm not going to list their names of the actresses, because, well... they don't matter in the story), a full-on ""zombie"" attack breaks out, forcing them to flee and seek shelter.After meeting with a former colleague, Deputy Secretary-General Thierry Umutoni (Fana Mokoena) aboard a navy vessel, Gerry agrees to accompany a team on an increasingly dangerous series of missions all over the world, searching for the cause of this ""zombie"" outbreak and a way to try and stop it.The acting is good. Pitt plays a convincing man who is struggling between his duty to try and remedy the situation, while also not wanting to lose his family. Mokoena plays a good (albeit generic) military figure. Daniella Kertesz is very good as ""Segen"", an Isrealli soldier whom Gerry saves. And just to be fair, though she's essentially useless in the film, Mireille Enos is decent as Gerry's wife Karin. I will not comment on the two actresses portraying their daughters, because they just weren't very good, and I don't want to say something nasty about a child actor.And to be honest, much of the production is very good. The direction by Marc Forster is very competent, and he's grown tremendously as an action-director since his mess-of-a-Bond-film ""Quantum of Solace."" The music by Marco Beltrami was a blast, and had a very cool, simplistic, almost retro sound. And the photography, set and production design was great. (Although the ""Zombies"" looked bad, I'm sorry.)However, a film with such decent acting and such a strong visual production is what makes the glaring problems stand out even more.The script is the first issue, and arguably the biggest issue. One of the fundamental necessities for a film is to have characters we identify with, and either go through development or don't go through development as a result of the events they face in the film. This film makes no effort to establish characters beyond the most rudimentary, painfully clichéd set-ups and robotic dialog. Nor is there any effort made to develop characters. These didn't feel like people, they felt like people-shaped wind-up toys. And the pacing of the script doesn't help. It's so break-neck that you can never actually get a feel for anyone, nor do you get the chance for the gravity of the situation to set in. Which is a shame because there are so many potentially amazing scenes. But unfortunately, within 30 seconds of any scene starting, ""zombies"" show up and we're onto the next scene after a prolonged chase sequence.The other huge problem is how the film mishandles the idea of ""zombie""- horror. You've probably noticed that I've made an effort to put the word ""zombie"" in quotes. And that's for a reason- the ""zombies"" in this film... aren't really ""zombies."" They're just sort of a crowd of sprinting people who bite you once then keep moving. They're not scary. In fact, up until about the halfway mark on the film, they weren't even portrayed as undead, they were portrayed as sick, rabid people- which made it really rather jarring when you suddenly see a corpse's fingers moving and realize that they technically are supposed to be ""undead.""But the film seems to want to portray zombie's as a feverishly paced marathon team that just sort of rams their way through things. And it doesn't work for the horror or suspense, because every encounter with a zombie turns into the same sort-of chase scene over and over. The film gets boring really quick when you realize that every 10 minutes, we're going to see the heroes sprinting away from a huge group of people. With the exception of one scene set in Jerusalem, the film's horror and action scenes just came off as a bore to sit through.I'm quite sad at how this film turned out. I'm a huge zombie-horror fan, and I thought the trailers for this film made it look like it was going to do something new and exciting. However, the reality is that a poor script and mishandled material are not new and exciting. They're about as old as film itself, and they're still a chore to sit through, even with good performances and pretty visual effects.""World War Z"" gets a 4 out of 10 from me. It's only for hardcore fans of the actors or ""zombie"" films.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

A simple zombie movie which you can show to the general family, but really that goes against the point of it all.I have to concede that yes it looked very good. However, that kind of defeats a Zombie movie which usually is about creating great scares from low budgets. Brad Pitt is excellent as always but this story is boring, generic and baggy, and some might note jingoistic agenda items which will make everyone groan.Zombie movies have been coming at us like a pack of rampaging zombies on TV, film and video games, and personally it's all been done to the death (the puns pile up with this genre).There's nothing of note in this film. The Glasgow setting and scenes at the start were great but the rest of the film is best cut. The ending is dreadful writing.Avoid this, I'm just happy that I saw it on free to air TV so no cost. Don't waste your time, just be thankful they are NOT making an unnecessary sequel.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The casting is great with Brad Pitt and Mirielle Enos with solid interesting choices for bit parts and extras. I liked that it was multi-cultural cast and not all white. There is a plot with a beginning middle and end but the direction lacked intensity and pacing. The beginning is a boring montage to setup the apocalyptic world run amock with Zombies. They wasted an opportunity to create some chills and surprises. This is no 28 days later. I can't understand how so many set pieces could be filmed in the most boring ho hum way possible. It's clear that the script provided a solid blueprint but the director went for poor shot selection. Furthermore, you have Brad Pitt in a movie and I saw more of his stupid haircut and chin then his eyes. Last, after seeing the film last night, I woke up and couldn't even remember the ending. I had to ask my friend how the movie ended. I was reminded that it ended with another boring montage.

Sorry, Mr. Pitt has done far far better work. Even the cinematography was essentially your basic soap opera cut away from speaker to speaker. Did they run out of money? Or just ideas. Thank God for Shaun of The Dead. Nothing short of brilliant. You cant fool an intelligent audience with the use of colors and contrasts. In the cold light of day they are simply makeup on a pig. Perhaps they should consider doing a different hybrid such as The Curious Zombie of Benjamin Button. A Zombie that grows backward to a point where its back to its human form.

If this movie had been *anything* like the book, it would've been a pseudo-documentary, not this thing, whatever it is. Like, what's the point of buying a brilliant book and making it almost entirely unlike the thing it's purported to be? It's just plain arrogance on the part of the producers. Now, I'm not one of those people who go on and on about how ""I liked the book better."" I generally like to let movies stand on their own, but for God's sake, it needs to at least resemble the damned book. This thing is not. Not at all.

By the time the movie ends, most in the audience were surprised by its haste ending. Like the Terminator 4, World War Z's budget was burnt up before it can stage a reasonable ending. Those special effects probably took a big chunk of the budget. Yet they are coarse and not convincing. The South Korean setting looks bad and was probably taken in Hollywood factory. The Israeli one is better but still below average. In total, this is a haste-makes-waste movie.

I think it would naturally imply that you are going to see a reasonable amount of shooting from the films main character and a large amount of gore people being ripped apart, eaten etc. Sadly if you made those quite reasonable assumptions you would be completely wrong.The main character seems more focused on micro managing his family who are continuously brought to focus (as opposed to the world wide zombie invasion that's going on around them killing millions every day..). He is asked numerous times to help save the world and he turns it down in favour of .... You guessed it looking after his family who are safe 99% of the time throughout this movie. How any bloke is supposed to relate to this character is quite frankly beyond me.From what we have heard the film was focus grouped to death presumably by a bunch of 50 year old women who didn't like the title and didn't want to focus on any of those things but instead thought what should of been a minute part of the plot his family should take precedence.Sadly what you are left with is a watered down gutless movie with clear signs of its focus group attention. Even the soldiers that end up defending Brad Pitt were replaced with female soldiers just to try and appeal to the female audience (if the other overplayed parts about his family were not enough)At the end of the day if you are female and like Brad Pitt you will probably like it. If you are a guy and wanted what the title promised you are going to be sorely disappointed.I just really hope if they make another of these that they get someone to do it properly and fire the female focus groups, there is a reason zombie movies have stuck to a formula in the past, it's because it works this film is a perfect example of when it doesn't.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Surely, we as a race deserve a more worthy nemesis.'Y' could not the movie start with a much stylish origin and end with the good guys winning  it is just horrifying to think that they might be cooking up a sequel to it.'Y' was the climax (like a friend suggested) straight out of Michael Jackson's thriller video and the audience couldn't help but laugh even in such a grave situation?'Y' . ?Just look out for Brad Pitt in the movie  oh wait  there is no one else you'll see so don't worry about it.The flip side to it is, spend 116 minutes in an AC cinema hall in this sweltering heat and enjoy the 3-D effects if you must.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

To my surprise i found myself enjoying it very much.. until just over the halfway mark,, then it crashed, figuratively and literally ( in my beloved Wales ).. The last half hour of this film is appalling, they should have stuck the end credits on straight after the plane crash. As it stands there are so many pot holes in the plot it makes Prometheus look positively deep. all you had to do was blast any area where the zombies are, with , oh.. megadeath? and then you could nuke them once they were crawling all over the bass bins... the scenes in Isreal and the sequence on the plane are exceptionally well made set pieces, but a few of these does not a good movie make. Ultimately, like almost every other blockbuster this summer, a tedious letdown. wait for the DVD.... ( it was criminal to see Peter Capaldi being totally wasted to :)","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

The last 12 months is already home to three of the top five zombie movies in the box office with Hotel Transylvania, Warm Bodies and now World War Z at number one. It was only a matter of time there would be a blockbuster zombie movie with a big star to sell it. If the concept of a blockbuster zombie movie is to simply to take it to an international and epic scale then that's enough to get me intrigued, if not excited. It's just a shame that it means the filmmakers can never make up their minds with what the damn movie will be about. World War Z throws us into the action with absolutely no investment into the characters at all then expects us to be excited. With it's inevitable PG-13 rating, it cuts from all the gore having the core problem that plagued The Hunger Games - it's about the one thing it's not allowed to show.I love Brad Pitt, I think he's a great actor and his wallet is especially great for contemporary indie cinema, he certainly did make the film much more watchable. The only reason I wanted to see this was to support him as the film reportedly had massive production problems. Unfortunately the problems are quite evident as some scenes feel cut short and simple and stupid. The problem with all these new zombie movies is that each one has to set up the world and each time it's dull. The last zombie movie that did it efficiently was Shaun of the Dead and the last movie that worked was Zombieland which completely sidelined the origin of the zombies and was much better for it. Granted, World War Z does have some good ideas I liked scattered around such as Pitt's character going to commit suicide if he turned into a zombie and North Korea removing everyone's teeth. But the flaws definitely outweigh them. The amount the protagonist survives and the contrivances to get the plot to where they want it is a bit much. Characters seem to react in quite unrealistic ways, a very clear trope of a blockbuster with no focus. But at the very least it's consistent.I keep forgetting that Marc Forster is essentially a director-for-hire. He impressed me far too much with Stranger Than Fiction that his output before and after is dishearteningly disappointing. As Quantum of Solace proves, he can't direct action. I didn't like the cinematography here, it's too hand-held and washed out whereas I wanted something cinematic. I actually quite liked the epic shots of the zombies, particularly the one where they clamber over each other to get over the great wall. It was only until the small scale third act that it was saved from being mediocre. While the action/setpiece scenes did admittedly get better and better by a little bit, it was only until the end when the film had suspense. Perhaps it was due to the context of the adventure that preceded it where the stakes felt high to the audience that made it better, but I definitely thought it brought the whole film to being at least average. World War Z is technically a disaster movie and not an action or horror movie and it's at its best when there isn't much disaster.5/10","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

This movie is in the latter category. The movie starts strongly, presenting an apocalyptic picture of humanity in crisis. The cause of the problem - a disease - seems intractable and how it impacts on humans most alarming. Then the story loses steam and what has been scary becomes laughable, and the movie soon devolves into an unintended comedy. One problem is that the mysterious disease itself is too en debilitating to transform its victims into ogres. Their jerky motions and emaciated bodies create an image of illness, not horror, and soon the movie seems to be spoofing illness. After a while, the movie takes on the mantra of slapstick comedy as the people are running around frantically, going hither and yon, making lots of noise and accomplishing nothing. In some scenes, this movie more resembles a Mac Sennett production. People, some dead, others alive, colliding into one another, making all kinds of noises and gesticulations. At that point, the presence of Buster Keaton would have helped. Instead, the audience gets Brad Pitt whose character is grimly determined to set things right, and his solution is ... well, let's just say it is a novel one, even for Hollywood. The scary people, or rather non-people, after a while lose whatever scariness they project as they demonstrate a talent for dancing a jig, which one could call The Twitch, and producing an interesting array of sounds denoting an acoustical form of communication akin to that of whales. They also have protruding teeth which may offend people with dental problems, especially those with upper-bite issues. Introduce Abbott and Costello into the story and you have an amusing comedy; with the Three Stooges a comedy classic.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

I gave it a 5 because it is an enjoyable film but it was often unintentionally funny and it felt rushed a lot of the time. Now before i upset a few people, i do like Brad Pitt. But this is one of the worst performances by a lead man i have seen in a while. He is almost like a robot at times. I in no way felt attached to his character, i felt no urge for him to succeed because he just didn't seem human. Even the infected had more emotion and they are just killing machines. Lastly, although the action and chase sequences are very good, it's what is in between that has summoned the additional Z's on my summary. There is no energy and as i said most of it comes across as funny rather than serious; look out for the angry infected who can't get her seat belt off.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Some of it was filmed where I live (Glasgow, Scotland) which generated much buzz. I'd actually read the book before seeing the movie (Not that I read a lot, but when I do, its usually the other way round) plus being possibly one of the biggest ""Walking dead"" fans around, I was really wanting the movie world to add something new (and to the epic scale promised by this) to the Zombie genre. Problem is, ""World War Z"" plays out nothing like what anyone would probably expect.The first complainants that many have had. Is that for a zombie movie, the flick is relatively bloodless. Now I'm not going to say this entirely ruins the flick, but it doesn't help. The Lack of horror doesn't do it any favours, but I was willing to enter the cinema excepting the fact that this was a ""PG-13"" zombie film, and so, one with vertially no blood. (Unless you count that massive cut Brad Pitt gets on his head after the big plane crash of the flick) No, my main problem with the film, is that there's more Brad Pitt than there are zombies, and that all of the wrong stuff has been taken from the book and thrown on screen. All of the locations in the movie I can remember being important in the novel, but I'd have rather they'd spent less money on all these locations (Which is probably what landed the film in its infamous financial trouble) and shown us more of the catastrophic amounts of zombies that are described in the book.Outside of one major monster attack, its all business as usual in the zombie movie world here. Its hardly a ""World war"" when we get restricted to a plane and a ""huge"" finale in a science lab. Again, I was willing to stick up for the movie turning into ""the Brad Pitt show,"" as having everything evolve around one character (unlike the novel) would make it all more movie-like. But this one guy doesn't seem to see much in his expensive travels.As an action film. You could do worse than this. But your going to be disappointed in every other way. Whether your wanting a horror movie, a good adaption, or the epic that we were once promised. The final product of this long drawn out mess is unfortunately still very so-so. Even if it could have been a lot worse.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

It is not the greatest movie, nor is the worst movie of its style. I think the movie was great with providing the story on such a large scale, but in my opinion it is movie that you can wait for. It's not one of those... you need to jump up, and go to the theater to see right now movies. Now this is my opinion based on my taste. I do, however believe that the movie could have contained just a little more action, with the showing more of the infection spreading in more cities. In the positive range for this movie, is that it was very creative in some aspects of the film, but also decently enjoyable on a level that I could sit through the whole movie. So, my honest review for this movie... is this, it is a okay movie.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

This is nothing like the novel or the absolutely amazing audio book of the same name. congratulations to max brooks with his six figure deal to sell the name, and none of the original ideas. SPOILER ALERT!!!This movie has problems. 1: speed of infection. ranging from 10 minutes to 12 seconds there is no way the airports could have been the perfect vector. the infected would have wiped out the airport before the planes left. 2: fluid virus spreads by all fluid. the blood in the mouth would have meant instant infection. bite alone is stupid. 3: even dead they are not dead. so a bite makes you immortal? the burned one's were still moving and they were ash? 4: the zombies all make the same noise that sounds like if you tried to suck in a fart while clenching. fart scream. 5: horde running at you. don't worry. if your a main character they only attack one at a time the rest Waite their turn and don't really use their arms. 6: a bolt action hunting rifle holds three to five rounds. not infinite. 8: those kids! what the hell. I have never seen a more irritating family in a fast paced thriller. Its worse then asthma girl in panic room! 9: who the hell is Brad Pitt in this movie? investigator, weapons and evasive driving expert, instinctively knows how to operate most vehicles. knows military operating procedure and they treat him like jams bond and archer had a baby. but hes a stay at home dad in his mid 40's? how much drugs did he sell on the job to make that happen?my advice. avoid this zombies for tweens Brad Pitt flick and go watch something good. or sneak into a theater at night and stare at the dark screen alone. its scarier and you would have more funthis is really the hangover 2 of zombie films. lots of build up, lots of let down.how this movie has seven stars just shows how rigged the rating system is.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Maybe it's my age but I much prefer the old school zombie, you know, the poor unfortunate soul who is denied his eternal rest by some nefarious voodoo priest, a priest who raises him from the dead in order to execute some horribly fiendish plan. That's the zombies that I like. These new George Romero ""flesh-eaters-without-a-cause"" zombies bore me to tears. The whole premise is so silly. Something stupid reanimates corpses who crave human flesh because........... There's never a good reason for it. Never.In World War Z we are told that the zombies are the result of some kind of bacterial infection. Once you're bitten you die in 10 seconds and are then completely reanimated as a corpse with only one thing on your mind; to infect the living! Huh??? They're completely stone cold dead! How can they have purpose and intention when they no longer have a mind?? A scientist explains at one point during the flick that they can't use counter-infections against the zombie hordes because there is no pulse. And yet the zombies in this movie can run a mile in less than a minute! They can leap 20 feet in the air! If they have no metabolism at all where on earth does all that energy come from?? How can they possibly still have vision when there is no brain activity whatsoever?? These are hands-down the stupidest of the Romero-inspired zombies I have ever had to sit thru. They're Super Zombies and, if you're like me you'll be praying for Brad Pitt to just get to the Kryptonite already 20 minutes into this snoozefest of a flick!","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Although it has some references to the book they are few. I will not put spoilers in and as a massive fan of the book I would suggest if you too have read it don't waste your cash on the movie. You will be painfully disappointed. It doesn't even work s a stand alone movie disconnected from the book.

Not because of the hackneyed storyline, but because it actually uses Jerusalem as a prop. What's in the sequel? Will the zombies chew on the refugees at Zataari? Does the unbridled self- importance of these big-budget directors and stars make anything fair game for their ugly fantasies?

This suspension of disbelief does not give the film-makers carte blanche to cobble together any old moronic claptrap that doesn't make one iota of sense. The presence of a fantasy element does not negate the need for a plot, characterisation or acting.

I just don't get it what is it that people find interesting and entertaining in this. There are some parts in the movie that have the potential to develop into something interesting but it never happens. The entire movie is about a guy investigating and in the end, all his investigation turns out to be pointless. The plot was just empty, there's nothing to say about it. About Pitt, I kinda felt like he was out of place. There were some scenes with a growing suspense but whenever the camera went back on him, I just couldn't take it seriously. I hope he doesn't continue with this kind of movies, I'm sure he can do way better. But anyway he played his part fine.Another thing that left me disappointed is that I was expecting to see a horror film and what i got was more like an action adventure movie. It wasn't scary at all. The special effects were nice I guess but nothing impressive. Overall, I wouldn't go so far to call it a bad movie but I really didn't see nothing special in it, just a waste of time.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Riding on waves of tension opposed to gore and squeamish nightmares (to the disappointment of sadistic degenerates), World War Z is an intelligent, thrilling, and scary zombie apocalypse movie and has become a strong reminder to never to be too hasty when writing off pop- commercial films. ""Really?"" you say? Really. Along with Pitt's glossy blonde bangs and the floating re-shoots and re-writes rumours, it didn't look promising. But when Foster is handed $200 million budget, instantly one assumes that the film is going to be mediocre; simply because no film should cost $200 million to produce unless it somehow allows the audience to experience it in a brand new dimension. Instead what this audacious capital investment did bring, were zombies that don't stroll like their under the influence, but sprint, jump and climb to a point where they swarm across the landscape like a plague of insects, creating surreal imagery.An ageing Brad Pitt stars as Gerry Lane, a father, husband and a former United Nations investigator whose life seems content until the world is struck by an infectious pandemic, ironically turning humans into energetic, mindless zombies. After scarcely escaping from the anarchy with his family and a newly orphaned boy to a safe zone on a government harbour of an aircraft carrier, Lane is left with no choice but to leave his family and is sent on a mission to investigate the disease. What follows is the treacherous worldwide journey where Lane's bravery and hope for the human race is brutally tested.The story and character development was flaccid and linear, and at times becomes disconnected with the background of the characters (to which is almost non-existence); so I recommend reading the novel An Oral History of Zombie War to get a deeper insight of lost sections of the film's story which has clearly been done for the purpose of entertainment and Hollywood conventions.Don't be expecting too much because it most definitely, won't deliver. Although World War Z had the potential to be a total disaster, solely Brad Pitt's name saved this film from being eaten alive. Nevertheless it's worth a watch. The suspense will get you.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

It was barley entertaining, it was long, no real character building, just a lot of CGI which could not be helped in some scenes, but not as many as they did. The script was not really great, you knew what was going to happen before it happened, it was that predictable and no real climatic ending.I heard rumors of production issues, aka, rewrites, and it shows. Actors look like their hearts were just not in this, and so many goofs, aircraft taking off from a carrier that is sitting still in the water, are you kidding me! As I said in my Summary, if you like Zombies, this will entertain you, all others will most likely be lukewarm on it. All in all, not really worth the cost of admission in my view.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

It is particularly insulting in the way that the Israelis are portrayed as the saviors of the Palestinians whereas it should be the other way around since the Palestinians are already secluded in giant Israeli jails!! I'm just hoping that this movie is not a justification for Israel to build more walls around the Palestinians. The movie is generally full of plot holes, stupidity, and lack of logic. This is fairly obvious since the beginning in the early onslaught when brad's kids are not grasping on to him and actually leaving their parents in the midst of it. Also, while on the run, why can't the mother soothe her daughter who's having some kind of strange attack which seems to be asthma. Also, when running around for supplies, the mom puts the daughter in the cart wasting all the space for survival supplies. She survived getting raped or assaulted in the middle of the supermarket but still managed to get a large supply of flares that were mostly wasted. ... This is only in the beginning so I won't say anymore to avoid spoiling this thing.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

This movie is flawed from the opening scene to the last. I actually felt as if the plot was being written as it was being filmed. Not so much a cliché horror flick, more of a coagulation of confusing, badly dramatised, badly acted and at times throughly unnecessary scenes. There are so many holes in the plot that I don't have energy or the will to list them. At one point I just wanted the zombies to kill everyone, just to improve the screen play. The one redeeming quality of the movie is the special effects, nothing out of the ordinary here but it does give a feeling of live action, quite unlike any zombie flicks of recent times. That said I still can't fathom some critics reviews of this picture, it must be beautiful Brad that distracts them from the stapled together plot, or simply they are overly impressed by movies respectable special affects. If you watch this movie and enjoy it, then fair play to you. But I dare you to watch it again with a pen and paper and jot down any inconsistencies, any that wouldn't happen moments, any WTF moments or just any WHY moments. Be warned though, you'll need plenty of paper!","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

That's right: I've read M. Brooks' story (both in Portuguese and in English) and I loved it. Yeah... I'm a huge fan of living-biting movies, so I had great expectations. Yeah... Maybe I'm not the biggest fan of Pitt's. Sure these are very good reasons for how disappointed I was after watching this movie... But maybe the true reason is not the most obvious one.If I didn't like how the story flips and turns, if I wasn't convinced by the acting, if I missed some of the classic premises of the 'zombie genre' in this movie, maybe that's because Hollywood itself became a zombie a long time ago. It keeps moving, it keeps growling, it keeps interacting with audiences... but, most of times, you can tell Hollywood is not alive anymore. And that's exactly why, in my opinion, this movie fails.When B. Pitt got to snatch the rights of WWZ, we saw in his eyes that beautiful glitter of a kid's eye in a candy store. We anticipated the endless possibilities of a project built over the dream of a non-compromising fan, rather than over some bureaucrat's plan.But all the options, all the solutions, all the answers were the ones we've seen over, and over, and over again, from Hollywood great contemporary 'minds'. And... guess what?... We like to be surprised, we like to be challenged by different approaches, we are opened to new perspectives. We don't need the same old and comfortable pea soup...And this movie is a big fat disappointment. Plain and boring when it was easy to be something else...Maybe next time. In the sequel. Another dumb option.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

And Hollywood did not escape the invasion. This movie is basically a war against the zombies, who come out of nowhere and infest the world.The script is poor: coming from nowhere and without reason or explanation, the world is plagued by a zombie apocalypse. Gerry Lane is able to save his family at great cost, but ends up having to rely on United Nations support, which they use to recruit him, almost by force, for a mission in Korea, where the zombie infestation is presumed to have started. From there, we basically run the world, watching its destruction, in contrast to the desperate attempts to save it, on the part of the main character. There is no functional road map, and the story turns out to be a trip around the world in the midst of chaos.The characters are poorly constructed. We know nothing, are mere figures for a story made to be swift and action-packed, like an ordinary blockbuster. So there is little material for the actors to shine, and neither does Brad Pitt escape a poor performance. The film is improved in the more technical aspects, where it is excellent. There is a lot of money involved in this very high budget movie, so we can see the best special effects and sound effects, great visual effects and high quality CGI, in addition to a careful characterization, especially the zombies. The costumes and sets were also very well thought out.Thought to sell quickly, the film features Brad Pitt (he sells a film reasonably well), zombies (it's fashionable) and lots of action and some gore to make it to the box office. However poorly it may be from the point of view of art and history told, it is a film to sell quickly, to raise a good amount of money and, from that point of view, worked well for the industry.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Not only a very boring story with absolutely zero value, but a perfect demonstration of how mentally debilitated and inept today's society is. And no, don't even try to dismiss it with the usual ""it's just a movie"" bullshit. This movie is a test, and if you enjoyed it, I am sorry, you've failed. You're not a functional adult.There are a lot of movies in which something extraordinary, or outright impossible is depicted. Dragons, flying cars, the Borg, Death Stars, we all love them. But we do on one condition. The impossible things may do whatever they want, but the possible ones, the things we know from our everyday life, must work as we know they do. There may be dragons, but still nobody should survive being impaled on a sword. Unless there is something magical about him. Miracles always need to have an explanation, otherwise it's just garbage.World War Z utterly and repeatedly fails on this. Yes, we may believe the zombie apocalypse. OK, there is a virus, and it turns humans into ferocious killing machines in fifteen seconds. Right. Not a very original idea, but hey, this is what idiots want to see, and they pay good money, I get the point. But no, a pressurized airplane will not survive a grenade blast, it will not attempt a controlled landing, and even if it does, the heroes will not survive just by some miracle, but even if they do, nobody will just jump off from the top of the wreck while there is a piece of metal piercing his liver. Even if he is Brad Pitt, because that's not magical enough for this. (They should've cast Chuck Norris for this role.) This is where I stopped watching this trash, and I can't decide whether I should regret the time I wasted on it or be grateful that I torrented it and didn't pay a dime. Yes, I'd be probably very upset if I paid for this crap. What have I thought on the first place? Hollywood garbage. I only give it two points because it looks good, and it was filmed in Budapest. But it wasn't worth messing up Nagymező street for this failure of a flick.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

In 28 Days Later we appreciate the devastation that has befallen the world as Cillian Murphy wanders through a deserted London with only pigeons and the husks of crumpled double-decker buses for company. The World War Z equivalent is Brad Pitt strolling along a short street of terraced houses somewhere in Wales. It's a pale imitation and, though far from clumsy, is inadequate.Inadequacy is the overall feeling of World War Z. It's enjoyable enough and has the occasional periods of tension, though most are given away in the trailer, and a few moments of magic. For my part, I loved the surging mountain of zombies attempting to breach the city walls in Israel but I wanted tension, I wanted to feel unnerved as well as excited. Alas, I was left wanting.Brad Pitt makes an able hero, as Gerry Lane, and he's believable as the dad who must return to the job he left with the UN to understand the cause and evolution of the disease that is wiping out mankind, in order to guarantee safety for his wife, Karin (Mireille Enos), and their children. The scripting is acceptable but there's a dearth of characters that really matter or that one can care about until the arrival of Segan (Daniella Kertesz) as a soldier Gerry acquires along his trek.Peter Capaldi, as a W.H.O. doctor brings a certain gravitas to proceedings but by then World War Z has stumbled into a reasonably predictable formula and, though Capaldi is a pleasure to watch, he's just another body carried along by the film.The occasional moment of genuine delight is marred by the odd example of clunkiness and the periodic travesty. World War Z may boast the best zombie mountain since the last one but it also shrivels under the glare of absolutely the most blatant, jarring, gratuitous product placement since Will Smith gushed over his Chucks in I, Robot: Tired of killing zombies? Why not relax against a drinks machine for a couple of minutes and pop yourself a Pepsi as the other survivors and the audience tick off the seconds and watch you It's unnecessary and it convinced me to knock another star off the rating.World War Z is emphatically not as bad many people will have you believe. It's fun, it passes the time but, coming from Pitt and a director of Forster's caliber, it jolly well should be better!

No, it simply makes the film difficult (and irritating) to watch. Had the film any quality going for it, there wouldn't be a need to use this amateurish camerawork so frequently.Then there's the zombies themselves. Just waiting to chase our hero up the stairs of the apartment block on the way to the roof. Wouldn't zombies wander randomly without any thought for hiding, attacking whomever they saw. Not jump out at the protagonist like a cheap horror film.Having finally reached the roof after escaping the clutches of the walking dead on the stairs, the zombies decide to stop and give Brad the time for some roof edge contemplation of whether he's been infected during the fight or not. Only after having decided he's okay do the zombies decide to make it to the rooftop. Ridiculous!All in the first twenty minutes. Very poor.Heavens-to-betsy, Brad and his family are saved by his buddies in the helicopter. I find myself wishing he'd had his head gnawed off so as to end this travesty sooner rather than later. It probably doesn't help that I generally don't rate Brad Pitt that highly either.My apologies but I refuse to waste any more of my valuable time watching this turkey.

Lately, the Israelis seem to have answers to everything and they are always a step ahead of the world. The fact that they built a wall that blocks everything seemed logical to the creators of this trash. And of course there's always Mossad the most efficient agency ever created.This is a travesty of a movie and Brad Pitt should be ashamed to be in it.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

World War Z is one of my favorite novels. So, I'm biased.But, Brad Pitt's version of World War Z really M. Nighted it.At least the worst adaptation ever made, The Last Airbender, followed roughly the same story beats and characters as its source material.Pitt's World War Z shamelessly tosses the characters and stories away, and it even manages to dump the tone and the concepts of the book in favor of shoddy CGI and painfully mediocre one-note performances.How this gets a 7 on IMDB is beyond me.I can't find many redeeming aspects to Pitt's WWZ besides some of the aerial shots of zombie hordes having a definite ""cool"" factor to them.A barebones plot with a laughable ""twist"" hollowly rounds out this disrespectful take on a classic book.This is a 5 at best if you haven't read the novel. It's an average-ish PG-13 popcorn summer flick with zombies.If you're a fan of this movie's supposed source material, then Pitt's WWZ feels like an insult. I got the same feelings watching this as I did when I watched The Last Airbender.Why would they do this to such a perfect IP?The answer is - probably money.A ""2"" rating is generous for this abomination.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

About time Hollywood made a big-budget zombie blockbuster. It's a genre that has been succumbed by the crappiness of low-budget horror. Unfortunately for the former, Hollywood failed bring uplift the Zombie genre. Instead, Plan B Entertainment has given us a cliché-ridden, CGI heavy zombie blockbuster that had nothing to do with the source material except for the title and the fact that the protagonist is a UN employee.It took a while for World War Z to get finished. Re-writes, re- shoots. I thought all those delays was just the work of a masterpiece in the making. I thought wrong. Over 200 million dollars have been wasted on this. The movie is just like any other summer CGI blockbuster. Except that there's CGI zombies this time. Not only that, the zombies act like a swarm of bugs when they are bunched up on each other. The protagonist Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) isn't interesting and all the bloody zombie violence you would expect is dumbed-down for a PG-13 rating to cater to younger audiences. There is one good thing though that World War Z brought that is worth noting. It is one of the few movies to watch a zombie epidemic happen on a global scale. It's a globe-trotting movie like any other but it is quite interesting. World War Z has the potential to be one of the greatest zombbie movies of all time. The source material was perfect for a movie, or a TV show at the most. But Hollywood screwed it up and we got a generic blockbuster instead.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Either they did not read the book or just chose to pretty much ignore it. About the only thing in common with the book was the title.In the book, the zombie war is over after 10 years and a journalist is traveling the world to interview survivors so he can write a book. The stories of survival and the politics of the war are totally ignored in the movie. Actually, pretty much everything in the book was ignored by the movie. The Brad Pitt character does not even exist in the book. The battles, decisions and strategies from the book are absent from the movie while the action scenes are totally made up for the movie. Now, I will say that the scene in the WHO was quite intense and great for those who cherish action over plot and script.I think this movie was made to set up the possibility of sequels to this movie. This movie sets the beginning of the war before people begin to stand up and fight back. If that is true, perhaps some of the well written accounts can be brought to the screen. Hopefully they have time to read the book before the next one is made.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

And, of course, if there was no Brad Pitt in this movie, nobody would care about it. It's simply not fun. Boring and predictable. Zombie movies are for other crew who can make it fun to watch (since the whole idea of zombies is a complete nonsense, par excellence) like George Romero (the ""father"") or Jonathan king (""Black sheep"") or all that stuff with the Umbrella Corporation. And some others, who understood the point and pictured it ridiculous as it in fact is. Don't get me wrong: considering the thousand times before seen ""plot"", it has been correctly directed and made altogether, but what really scares me is the possible sequel (due to the inevitable cliffhanger). Don't make it, please. Let us play Plants vs. Zombies. That's what they are for. To play with and have fun.

Forget the source material and watch the film as its own experience, that way you can more accurately judge it. With that open mind you will see that World War Z is very generic and forgettable, a lazy attempt in a very crowded genre. Much of the criticism surrounding this movie has revolved around how far it strays from the source material, that by doing so World War Z just becomes another zombie movie. I never agreed with the visceral reaction to straying from the source material, the book isn't high literature, it's not some unassailable classic, so it never upset me that they took great liberties with it. However, it really does seem unfathomable that they could make a less interesting movie than the one they did. In my opinion this movie is caught between worlds; it doesn't know if it wants to be an action movie that takes you from set piece to set piece, or if it wants to be a more thoughtful addition to the genre. Instead, it never commits to either and thus never does anything particularly well. The development hell that this movie went through are well known, and you can see it play out on screen as there's no core to it. The best I can figure is that through countless re-writes (including the final, famous rewrite and re-shoot) elements from many different ideas got lumped together, but an internal logic was lost along the way.Parts of the movie seem to want to play up a feeling of tension, other parts want to go full action movie, and yet others want to go for good old disaster porn. Is this movie 28 Days Later? Is it Aliens? Or is it The Day After Tomorrow? With such a clutter of competing ideas, no single one ever takes hold, and the audience is left drifting in the wind. The tension has no teeth, the action is boring, and the ramifications of a world ending zombie war aren't really explored in great detail. One final point; for a movie that puts a lot of emphasis on action set pieces, you will be hard pressed to see find one that makes them less compelling. There's very little weight to the action because the zombies are just so over powering, one turns into 10 in mere seconds, entire cities are fully infested within a matter of minutes, and they're so fast and strong that humans can't compete. This may be compelling on paper, but all it means is that the action is like watching a ridiculous video game. And speaking of video games, who did the special effects for this movie, and how did they pass quality control? World War Z has absolutely terrible CG, it was awful in 2013 and only looks worse with each passing day. Even the makeup of the zombies looks laughable. The poor special effects really hammered home to me that this was not a labor of love, and instead was something closer to a burden on all those involved.It's not a terrible movie, but there's better ones to see. Nothing is done well enough to make up for the things that it does poorly.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Featuring Brad Pitt in a leading role, this film has decent production values and adds some new twists to the old zombie formula, but it's the storytelling that keeps it from being anything but a snorefest.The main problem is that the story has no cohesion. The locations switch between every scene, as Pitt's character travels across the world looking for the cure for the zombie disease. This is realistic in the sense that if a real pandemic got released, the solution would almost certainly have to be international. One lab comes up with one part of the solution, and so on. Yet an engaging story this would not make, so their solution is to have Pitt travel across the world, collecting these clues and solutions, causing the film to be jumpy and scattered. It's just a series of action sequences and spouted exposition dialogues.That being said, when the film finally calms down and stays in a single locations for a longer amount of time, the film's quality picks up instantly and we get our needed intense zombie scares. And the zombies in this films are actually rather good. They have enough traditional elements to feel genuine, but they have been upgraded with some clever twists that allow for some crazy visuals.Aside from that, Pitt is not a bad lead actor and as stated, the ending is genuinely interesting. It's just a shame that we had to wait so long for the film to turn good. As it is, this is a slightly below average popcorn flick with some redeeming qualities. If you're a hardcore zombie fan, you'll probably receive some enjoyment out of this. The rest of you, there are better movies out there.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

World War Z is loosely based off the book with the same name. However from what i'm told they are nothing very alike. World War Z was plagued with production problems much like it's zombies. I tried to like this film but in the end I could just not enjoy myself enough to get over this mediocre slump. World War Z suffers from pacing problems and a nonsense plot....even for a zombie film. Sure a pg-13 big budget movie might be great for the younger crowds but this movie was already made so much better a few years back it was called '28 days later' it even had a good sequel called '28 weeks later'. The other major problem that plagues this film is that it is complete cgi overload. it looks fake and flimsy. It's distracting and a big turn off. World War Z has a few moments of fun (zombies on a plane) and even a few jump scares, but they are to far and few between. Brad Pitt tries to save this film from falling into being average grade, but even he cannot save this film. I won't even rant about the ending and how it makes me cringe with how stupid it is. Many average audiences will love this film , however seasoned zombie veterans and horror fans alike will best avoid this film. Rating: 5 out of 10","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I watched the whole thing with a straight, no scariness, no suspense, no character development just zombies to me and decent acting. There's no depth when it comes to the characters so you're not attached or upset or tense when one of the characters is about to die. The cgi is impressive but doesn't feel real so there's not much effect. Nothing really stands out about this movie compare to other zombie movies. It's the same cliché plot where one man saves the world from disaster and we know he won't die cause he's the hero. Could've been way better but falls flat for me.

Soon a virus similar to rabies has hit all of the major population centers around the world with no known cure. Normal people are suddenly transformed into psychotic maniacs who attack others and spread the disease at an alarming rate. When it hits Philadelphia, ""Gerry Lane"" (Brad Pitt) is pressed into service to help the United Nations find a cure. So much for the plot which has been played out numerous times in one fashion or the other. What makes this film unique is the money that was spent producing it. As such the movie boasts plenty of action, decent CGI, various locations and some good actors. Unfortunately, it's missing an important ingredient--gore. As a result it pales in comparison to other films in the zombie genre. Films like ""28 Days Later"" or ""Day of the Dead"" for example. Now, don't get me wrong, as I said earlier it has plenty of action and it also has some good suspenseful scenes here and there. But it just didn't seem to be enough. And a person doesn't have to be a gore hound or a zombie enthusiast to recognize this. However, considering all of the money spent on positive advertising, my opinion probably won't matter when all is said and done. In short, I liked it to a degree but for the money spent to produce it I believe that it should have been much better.","4 out of 18 found this helpful.

I highly recommend it, even if you hated this movie. It is a wonderfully unique take on the Zombie genre. It has a singular background story that you can piece together, but doesn't tell it directly. Instead, it is a collection.of individual, raw, stories, that capture a spectacular and otherwise extremely realistic human side to the far fetched tradgedy of a zombie apocalypse. It looks at angles not seen in other works in this genre. It makes you think and ponder and takes multiple perspectives on this tragedy.I knew there was no way a single movie could capture all of these stories. So, going into this movie, I wondered which one or maybe two stories from the book would they focus on?The aanswer: None of them. No eof the stories in the book were a part of this movie. The only things this movie has in common with the book are a Zombie apocalypse and the title,Ostensibly, one could imagine that this is simply a new story that fits in the universe of the book, if one were being generous. But, it's not. In the book, most zombies are the typical slow, lumbering, zombie with a few fast zombies here and there. Sometimes, there was a concentration of fast zombies in one area. The movie, however, shows every Zombie in the world as a fast zombie, probably to try to scare the audience more. So no, it doesn't even fit in the universe of the book. Also, it didn't work... This mivie wasn'tscary in the slightest.This movie is the opposite of the book in almost every other conceivable way. The book was full of thoughtful introspection, and multiple viewpoints. This movie is a braindead action fes that focuses on one man and barely has a plot and lacked any senseof realism. I felt no human connection to any of the charactersI'm so tired of the one person against the world / universe trope in almost every freaking movie. The book gave me hope that this would be different, but I was let down in every way. Everything that was good about the book was completely absent from this movie. I know movie adaptations have to change things here and there, but this felt like the scriptwriter wiped himself with the book and just wrote his own, terrible thing.Brad Pitt's acting was nothing to write home about either. He didn't have great material to work from, but he was still pretty stiff and emotionless. I know he can do better than this.Don't waste your time with this trash.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I'm not kidding when I say that it's even more boring and predictable than the most stereotypical of zombie movies. The action scenes feel like something from a textbook, and the plot is, yes, textbook. It was hard for me to sit through this because I really did feel like I was watching a movie made from a checklist.It was oddly surprising to watch a large budget movie that isn't even as good as it's cheaper counterparts. If you compare this to such movies as Cloverfield, I Am Legend, Walking Dead, War of the Worlds and Thirty Days of Night, this movie doesn't even come close to any of them, yet borrows scenes from all of them.

I thought okay, looks like a decent horror flick with plenty of action and with Brad Pitt? Actually, thought the wife would enjoy it more than I. There just wasn't enough of the usual zombie stuff here, lots of computer generated special Fx action scenes though.

Both by the way are quite entertaining with plenty of laughable moments.Sorry, nothing special here except Brad which can be absolutely perfect with the right part, particularly ones where he's not talking with an accent.This might have been a better experience for those watching in theaters. But even on Blu-ray with a Dolby surround speaker system, just not enough excitement here. As of today they've managed to gross over $500m so good news for those who enjoyed it.

I just want to address what I dislike about this particular film and all its shortcomings. What bothers me most about this film is that without the association of the bestselling book, this film wouldn't be paid any mind. It's sloppy, especially when it comes to the CGI wall of zombies, which is over-simplistic and an obvious McGuffin, as are many contrived plot devices that spur forth the plot. The only similarity to the source material is the use of multiple countries, which is so obviously forced to accommodate the change in script. Brad Pitt (who is just playing himself) is given Christ-like status as he is the only one who can travel around the world, not get infected, save the life of an Israeli soldier, and find a solution to the virus. Instead of detailing the worldwide economic, political, and military interventions of a zombie war, this film just follows one inept guy as he lucks out again and again against the zombie foe. The ending is the most infuriating aspect, as it leaves everything on an ambiguous note, even though the entire film follows the one person who can supposedly save the world, and he does. Turning a book about the real world impact of a zombie apocalypse into a point and click adventure starring Brad Pitt means you cannot finagle an up in the air ending to seem deep. Either they should have streamlined it further in order for it to be another zombie film, or the book should never have been adapted, which would have made everyone happy in the first place.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

There are no real likable characters and even the ""Zombies"" or ""Infected"" are not that scary or believable. It just feels like something we have seen before, (28 days later, Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead, The Crazies etc etc), with Brad Pitt as the lead character (his character also not really believable or likable in my honest opinion.) The Plot is also somewhat of a let down, and very predictable (I have not read the book, but some claim that the Screenplay missed the mark completely.. )If you are really into recent Apocalypse Zombie type flicks, do yourself a flavor and rent Zombies of Mass Destruction (ZMD). Even with it's low budget and very obvious dark humor approach, it was way more entertaining to watch than World War Z.

In addition to stand on a soundtrack that is struggling to harmonize.

When an outbreak of a rabies variant strikes worldwide with the infected exhibiting ""zombie-like"" behavior, Gerry Lane is reluctantly brought back to the UN in exchange for sheltering of his family in the UN fleet as he travels the world looking for an explanation behind the Zombie outbreak and hopefully a cure.World War Z is loose adaptation of the Max Brooks novel, World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War. Taking inspiration from the 1984 book, ""The Good War"": An Oral History of World War Two by Studs Terkel, Brooks framed the book as a series of reflective interviews looking back upon the zombie war after humanity had won with a nameless interviewer going around the world discussing the subject with all manner of persons involved in the war to some capacity and using the book as a satirical look at government ineptitude, corporate corruption, and general shortsightedness wherein the distractions of politics, culture, or economics hamper responses taken in times of great upheaval. Adapted by Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment following a heated bidding war with Leonard DiCaprio's Appian Way, the movie was beset by all manner of production and story problems prior to release including scrapping the original planned third act set in Russia which resulted in the budget ballooning to $190 million. The movie also nixed many of the political overtones from the novel, including speculation of the zombies originating in China in the hopes of securing a Chinese release (which didn't happen). Despite the multitude of productions problems and bad buzz, the movie was pretty successful and while it wasn't able to spawn theatrical sequels (due in no small part to China's censors cracking down on film's with ""occult"" themes) the movie does still live on thanks to its well regarded video game follow-on set in the same universe. The movie itself however is pretty standard.The best way to describe the film adaptation of World War Z is imagine Roland Emmerich's 2012 if you got rid of the humor and instead of the Earth destabilizing you now had hordes of zombies. That's basically how World War Z is structured with a series of ""money shots"" our plot armor hero, Gerry Lane, goes through such as the oft referenced ""zombie tower"" in the marketing that is just as silly and ridiculous in the film as it is in the trailers and TV spots, and interviewing various people in South Korea, Israel, and Wales in the hopes of finding answers to how to stop the zombie plague and how it began. The big selling point of World War Z is in its ability to show more Zombies on camera than films like 28 Days Later or Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake as well as The Walking Dead TV series which was still in its heyday at this point. World War Z does feature large scale zombie hordes, but because of the fact this was shot for a PG-13 shots that show large masses of people running in flight from the zombies just look like people running from nothing because the Zombie's can't be distinguished in such a manner where we can tell who the fleeing people are and who the zombies are.The moments that worked the best for me were the ones that felt smaller scale in place of the larger scale action beats. Despite the third act being a massive reshoot and well publicized scrapping of a major action setpiece, the third act being a quieter more stealth based affair is probably the best part of the movie as Gerry and his companions sneak around a cordoned off wing of a W. H. O. Facility narrowly avoided the zombies. There are a number of scenes in the film that do stand out such as David Morse playing a former CIA agent who turned traitor for the North Koreans, or Ludi Boeken as a Mossad chief in Israel whose ""Tenth Man"" speech taken from the book is one of the few moments that attempts to address the political side of the Zombie apocalypse and hints at the more interesting movie that could've been. But for every moment like that there are also some groan worthy moments, particularly in the early scenes with Gerry Lane's family encompassing every cliché from this type of family unit you've seen over the past 10 years. One of Lane's daughters comes close to being as annoying as Dakota Fanning was in Spielberg's War of the Worlds and Mireille Enos of The Killing is wasted in a nothing role as Lane's wife Karin that originally had a subplot involving Matthew Fox as a secondary antagonist, but like the Russia sequence was scrapped and judging from what was there probably didn't amount to much.World War Z if taken as a standard Summer action film will be perfectly serviceable. Pitt is a charismatic lead even if his role is essentially a blank slate, and there are some interesting sequences, locales, and supporting performances. However for fans of Zombie films or fans of the book this will be really disappointing as it's not allowed to go as far with its subject matters as The Walking Dead or 28 Days Later nor does it carry much of the biting subtext from the book.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Mostly because I know a lot of people like this movie, but unfortunately I have to disagree. And this doesn't mean anyone who likes this movie is dumb or anything like that, absolutely not. I just personally didn't like this film. Okay, on to the review.One thing to note about this movie is that it had a whole lot of production problems going in. It had rewrites, they had to shoot in different locations, etc. And this made this made all the bad parts of the movie pretty obvious as well. But for me, the reason this movie doesn't work is that the characters are about as interesting as looking at your mailbox for 2 hours. There was nobody that was interesting in this entire thing. Which is a pretty big problem considering its a zombie movie, and the thing that carries most good zombie movies for me is good characters.Another thing that just destroyed this movie is that its so cliché. I feel like almost every single modern movie cliché in existence is used here. The shaky cam, the running amount of conveniences, the main character having a pointless family so he can be more identifiable, fast zombies (okay I actually like that one), the main character surviving injuries that pretty much most human beings couldn't survive. If I listed off all the clichés we would be here all day.Another reason why I hate this movie is that its just another generic zombie movie. BUT WITH BRAD PITT! there isn't anything different about its story structure, its use of zombies, its characters or anything. Which is a shame, because I heard the book this is based on (saying that loosely here) actually had a lot of originality and great ideas to it. It probably was that they wanted to have this be more accessible for mainstream audiences or maybe the production problems had something to do with it, but I don't know. Anyways, I generally didn't like this film for numerous reasons. I just wished it could have been more like the book.Final Score: 3/10","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Being the hero of a Hollywood movie, naturally he gets himself and his family to safety, and gets in touch with his old muckers at the UN to find out what's going on, and they end up taking him away from his family to lead a trek over to Israel to discover the source of the mayhem, and look for a cure to stop it before it's too late.Shot in a new, almost experimental digitally altered lens, World War Z is the latest film to re-hash the 'zombie' genre, already explored by the likes of I Am Legend and Dawn of the Dead, not to mention Brit entries like 28 Days Later and 28 Weeks Later. So originality isn't the name of the game here (when is it in Hollywood these days?) and with the bar set so low, you'd expect this knock off of other films before it to at least try and take the genre in a different direction. But World War Z simply explodes in to the action within the first few minutes, without any sort of attempt at character development, meaning we could simply care less about the fate of these characters, which makes the ensuing ride all the more tedious.Impressive zombie effects can't hide a banal, boring script that's lost your attention within the first few minutes. As such, lead star Pitt blandly goes through the motions, at the hands of slovenly direction from Marc Forster. Sometimes these types of films can try and have some kind of hidden social message to them or deeper significance, but it's hard to pick up anything here. Despite being the type of film it would probably have been better to have seen there, this failed to draw me to the cinema to see it, and I left it to DVD, where it's minimal impact is felt even less. Not so much World War Z, more World War Zzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Certainly Z grade. **","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

I enjoy the pivotal movies of the genre, in particular the likes of the Omega Man and Romero's Zombies series. A summer blockbuster budget offering it does not lack in spectacle, ambition and special effects. As such it works pretty well. However as a contribution to the Zombie body of work it is poor.Director Marc Forsters' credentials are illuminating. He handled the big budget of Quantum of Solace satisfactorily, but added little to the tradition of Bond in a fairly soul less movie. The Kite Runner, a much smaller budget with a far better script, was a great success though. Here his ambition of a worldwide epic never gets started. The opening United States sequence is strong enough, but the characterisation of Brad Pitt's persona, Gerry Lane, is shallow, his family are simply irritating. On more than one occasion I hoped that his children were devoured in a single zombie bite. So as the family backstory bites, so irritation levels rise. When the action moves to the Middle East the sequences are impressive and exciting, but the final forty minutes are devoted to a cat and mouse denouement which should have lasted four minutes.If you are looking for a big budget spectacular, you will not be too disappointed. If you are looking for a strong plot, a great screenplay and a compelling zombie story you will be very disappointed.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

"5","/10","World War Z- A Bewildering Failure in Successful Adaptation That Results in a Mediocre Zombie Apocalypse Actioner","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2816873/?ref_=tt_urv","generationfilm","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22971631/?ref_=tt_urv","20 June 2013","It almost seems insulting to name the new apocalyptic zombie film World War Z after the highly acclaimed novel of the same name by author Max Brooks because there is not one ounce of accuracy in the film to the geo-political insight, thought provoking societal adaptation, or intelligent post-apocalyptic scenarios that Brooks' book contained in every riveting chapter. Mel Brooks' notably talented son crafted an incredibly intriguing novel that was a retrospect on how the world changed during the ten years battling an unknown zombie outbreak and yet Marc Forster's film, plagued by notorious rewrites, reshoots, and a relentless production hell, has only borrowed minor details in order to make a rather generic zombie feature. Critiquing World War Z on the merits of adaptation would result in an absolute failure of concept, execution, and character so the only other way of objectively reviewing the film would be an assessment in how well it fits in the post-apocalyptic and zombie genres on its own where it barely passes the minimum of critical standards. With a television show like ""The Walking Dead"" and films such as 28 Days Later offering superior options for the zombie genre of entertainment, where complex characters and human nature insight give us a fully conceptual and emotional experience, it's difficult to see desperate, minor efforts as anything but average. Unfortunately World War Z ends up being a drastically uneven affair with some occasionally solid action sequences featuring one dimensional characters we care almost nothing about and semi-intelligent concepts that are inevitably lost in the chaotic, physics defying fray that is practically relentless. The third act of the film has some uneasy atmospheric merit but the beginnings ambivalence to setting up complex characters and the middle's illogical and excessive middle make it a laborious trek to get through that has too much brawn and very little braininess for a post-apocalyptic film. Though the opening twenty minutes are hectically confusing enough to be engaging the remainder of the film feels incredibly fragmented in its tonal inconsistency and empty due to its lack of connection to a protagonist that never seems human, vulnerable, or complex. Considering the unevenness of Marc Forster's direction, the blandness in Brad Pitt's performance, the abandonment of adaptation accuracy from the original novel, and the crippling production problems the film encountered, World War Z can confidently claim the appropriate description of being mediocre.Read more: http://wp.me/py8op-A4; More reviews: Generationfilm.net","3 out of 18 found this helpful.

Production problems, re-writes (including a third act restructuring by premier go-to-guy Damon Lindelof), and a ballooning budget - it spelled a disaster that would have the critics crawling over each other to find the funniest words to describe its dreadfulness. As with John Carter before it, how disappointing it must have been to be presented with a half-decent movie. This is a brisk global thriller with some nifty set-pieces and a dogged determination to tell a straightforward story.I haven't read the source novel by Max ""Son of Mel"" Brooks, but by all accounts I wouldn't recognise it as the story told in this film. Brad Pitt (also producing) plays Gerry, a former UN worker who's worked in dodgy hotspots like Liberia, who becomes the reluctant saviour of humankind when the planet becomes overrun by ""Zees"". The zombies are portrayed like ants, bacteria, a Final Reckoning... This is the undead apocalypse in long-shot, which kind of muzzles their menace.Many modern movies feel overlong, but this is one that could do with fleshing out. While Gerry is gallavanting across South Korea, Israel, and, err, Wales, his family is in on a ship in the Atlantic, crying out for more character development. And for Gerry himself, it seems like every time he steps off a plane there's a chase scene waiting for him. Add to this the spoiler-tastic trailer and it all adds up to a cripplingly lack of tension.Tellingly, the best scenes in the film occur at the end, in the enclosed space of a science complex. It's here that the film takes a breath, and it most resembles the simpler, mostly superior zombie runarounds of yesteryear.Saying that, World War Z is a worthwhile addition to the genre. Purists may despair at the lack of gore and the absence of threat (Romero's original Dead series would never have indulged such an impervious and saintly hero), and readers at the departures from the novel. But mostly it should be enjoyed for what it is: a solid, workmanlike action-adventure, moderately original in its style and scope, if not its predictable plot developments.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

However, the case with Word War Z makes me wonder. Who is the intended audience for World War Z? In all aspects it's an OK zombie flick, a genre ridden with mediocrity. There are jarring plot holes and inconsistencies but not worse than in other similar movies. After all, this is a big budget movie made for a broad audience and that is perhaps the first problem. Is it even possible to make an involving zombie movie with PG-13? The effects are well done but there is no blood and it's not especially scary in comparison. The beginning of the movie is really good. Small hints of a catastrophe are looming in the background throughout the introduction. The audience just waits for the sh*t to hit the fan and with casualties in the billions it sure does, and quick. The organic blob-like waves of attacking zombies as seen in the trailers is a ""fresh"" new take to the genre. Things take a turn for the dumb quite quickly. There are too many ""really?!?"" moment, like ""did they really survive that?"" Make no mistake; this is a movie about Brad Pitt with a few extras on the side. Expect no intricate character portraits. This might be surprising since the book had no protagonist whatsoever. Yes, the book. If you have read the book and liked it odds are you will be disappointed. WWZ is one of the few books that addressed the issues of what the real result of a viral zombie outbreak and its long lasting effects would be. It's obvious that the author Max Brooks was (perhaps a bit too) obsessed with the idea. If you are kind you might say that the movie is set in the same universe as the book but even that is stretching it too far. The book is a well reasoned exercise in different aspect of cause and consequence in the face of an inhuman catastrophe. The movie is without spoiling too much, everything but that. Now, if you are going to throw the basic premise of a book out the window you are bound to alienate a big part of the audience, but why when call it ""Word War Z""? ""I am legend"" made the same mistake. This is a generic zombie movie and I tried to watch it as such, but it's hard to disregard the title. Now if you like Brad Pitt, please try to watch him best a zombie apocalypse without thinking too much about that book, OK?","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

"2","/10","Safe Zombie Movie with Brad Pitt","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2888340/?ref_=tt_urv","themissingpatient","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17513007/?ref_=tt_urv","17 October 2013","Brad Pitt plays a stay at home dad with a mysterious past. When an infection breaks out turning the majority of the world's population into zombies, it's up him to become a zombie killing super hero and save the world.World War Z is nothing more than another overly generic, clique-filled zombie flick. The fact that the film stars Brad Pitt is the only original aspect compared to any other zombie movie, video game or television series. Instead of using practical effects, which is what makes gore-filled survival horror films fun, World War Z completely relies on CG effects that, in a matter or a year or two, will look as bad as the over-rated Will Smith film, I Am Legend. The script pretty much follows the same plot as 2012, which was barely watchable itself. What makes the films different? Audiences are more likely to go see a film starring Brad Pitt and zombies rather than John Cusack and a misinterpreted Mayan prophecy.There were many screenwriters attached to this disaster. Give it to Drew Goddard and Damon Lindelof for delivering such a pathetic adaptation. Goddard and Lindelof started off writing silly television dramas including Nash Bridges, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, Alias and Lost. Both Goddard and Lindelof since has written screenplays that proved they should have never been allowed to make the transition from television to feature films. Films that are impossible to deny that they suffered from bad writing.The most disappointing thing about World War Z is to see director Marc Forster continue to waste his talents bringing such terrible screenplays to life. Forster has had past films such as Monster's Ball and Finding Neverland go to the Oscars. Since he has directed the most boring James Bond film to date, Quantum of Solace, and Machine Gun Preacher. World War Z has sealed his fate as just another Hollywood director unworthy of making the big budget films he is being hired to bring to life.World War Z is disappointing in every aspect and annoyingly predictable. It is the safest zombie flick you can watch which makes it the most most stale and boring zombie flick to date.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Based on the bestseller by Max Brooks, World War Z vaguely resembles its literary companion.Instead, this listless adaptation is more akin to a patchwork of expeditious but unexceptional undead, tired clichés and an obvious whimper of an ending.Incidentally, America's best defense against any brain-eating enemy is the Marines.Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.com","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

At best in any situation that's a fool's game. Movies are movies; novels are novels. They're just an entirely different genre. As much as the criticism that the movie isn't like the book may have validity, it's not really that relevant. Treat this as a movie and consider it on that basis. On that basis, it has both strengths and weaknesses. Let's start with the weaknesses, because they start leaping out right from the start, and they're more numerous.This seems to be a perfectly normal weekday morning in Philadelphia. There's nothing out of the ordinary. The Lane family wakes up and goes about their business, climbing into the car to head wherever they're all going. The only remotely newsworthy thing happening is a news report about an outbreak of rabies in various parts of the world. There are, however, no reports of problems in the United States. OK. There's a big traffic jam, and no explanation, but Philadelphia's a big city; unexplained traffic jams are probably not uncommon. Then, all of a sudden, with no warning, there are police and military aircraft racing ahead of the traffic jam - and Philadelphia is infested with zombies! Really? With no warning that anything was amiss? Really? I mean, if something was wrong Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) seems like the kind of guy who would have known. He's a former UN Inspector, who certainly has contacts as we learn. But this just pops up suddenly? Implausible at best, and given that it's happening all over US and international cities, just hard to accept. I get that a virus could spread rapidly because of air travel - but this was just too much. Add to that the fact that the ""zombies"" didn't really scare me all that much and had a bit of a sense of silliness about them, as well as the fact that none of the characters really hit home with me as people I connected with and cared about, and you have serious weaknesses.The basic strength of the movie is that it is mysterious (partly, I confess, caused by the implausible suddenness of the outbreak) and it is suspenseful, as you wonder whether there's any sort of solution to the outbreak, or whether this is just an ongoing battle against a hopeless situation. But it really would have helped if I had been given a character to care about. Even Pitt's Gerry failed to draw me in to the story. The result was that, Pitt's obvious recognizability aside, the performances here faded into the background.I'm thinking that zombie lovers will be underwhelmed by this. Personally, if I need a zombie fix, AMC's ""The Walking Dead"" is actually better. (5/10)","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

The final straw was when there was a plane crash of a large craft and it appears that only Pitt and one other important character survived. Come on. 100 people on board and only they survive? Other examples include earlier in the movie when they are climbing the stairs of the apartment building to escape from the roof. They barely make it to the roof but low and behold Tommy appears. I guess he just snuck through unnoticed. This movie has more holes than swiss cheese.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

You can't blame the source material, the novel is beautifully paced and excellently descriptive, everything this film isn't. This movie is definitely aimed more at the casual, popcorn audience other than anybody who really wants to feel anything on an emotional or cultural level. All thoughts of the novel are quickly lost and you realise that you wont emerge feeling any different than you did when it started.My initial feelings as the movie moved through it's opening sequences were of the equally flashy and emotionless blockbuster ""I Am Legend"", from not being able to forget that it's Brad Pitt, it's pacing and the over the top CGI zombies I already knew that this wasn't going to be for me. No blood, no guts, no sense, no emotion, no real thought or care.This is a disaster movie plain and simple, no questions are asked and none are answered. I never felt any jeopardy throughout the entire film and never feared for the human race. ""The Day After Tomorrow"" with zombies basically.CGI, why?? All terror is lost, all lingering thoughts that this is an actual re-animated human being leave you and that feeling is never revisited. When I think of the incredible work done by Tom Savini on the ""Dead"" movies, especially ""Day"". I really struggle to understand the thinking of producers and directors on this matter, there are no iconic moments, nothing that makes you not want to turn the lights out at night, it's honestly just pointless brain (no pun intended) fodder. Use CGI when you have to, when zombies are falling from buildings or creating the worlds largest pile-on great, all other times, go with what's real, what's actually there. I'd love to care enough to take this film apart but it's really not worth it, the makers obviously didn't care about the source material or the culture they were exploiting so I'm not going into any more detail. There is no reason why this had to be ""World War Z"", other than the rights to use the title this could've been any other mainstream blockbuster which is the biggest shame of this film. What a waste.Anybody who has even a slight interest in zombie films will instantly know that this is just filler, it serves a purpose and it'll make some money and then onto the next. Thanks for nothing Brad.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Romero Zombies in mind.This movie could have been amazing if they did a ""Crash"" 2004 style movie where they plucked 3-4 stories from the book and had them intersect in some meaningful way. Especially the Cannibal and cold north stories.Maybe if they do a sequel or a remake or turn it into an amazing HBO series, they'd do it some Justice.In conclusion, Max Brooks said when this movie was announced that he didn't care what they wanted to do with it, he knew that it would no longer be his story and that was fine because the check they cut him was cozy.

As such, it is difficult to rate this movie as a stand-alone viewing rather than in reference to the book. If you loved the book, you will only have the barest whiff of the ""World War Z"" flavor, kind of like walking past a restaurant and smelling the food.*EDIT* It has been a few days later and my anger at the sheer NAME STEALING FRAUD of this movie has sunk in while my anger has gone into a full boiling froth. I originally rated this as ""6"" being generous to the movie as itself (it not having any relation to the book except for stealing the name of it). So I am altering my rating to reflect this rage and Brad Pitt's (actor & producer of this movie) fraudulent divergence from the well-written book ""WORLD WAR Z"". If there is a real movie based on the ""WORLD WAR Z"" book out later, I will rate it fairly. Since this movie is a FRAUD stealing the name of the book, I am now rating this as a ""2"". Avoid this movie, you time & money is worth more than this vapid rip-off of a movie. *END EDIT*What is not in the movie? No traveling reporter unraveling the aftermath as the book did. No ""Battle of Yonkers"", no family reduced to cannibalism at a chilly Canadian lake, no ""Battle of Hope"" (where the army use the ""Cherry Popper"" incendiary bullets to roast the undead's brains, no Japanese survival experience with the Otaku & his blind gardener guardian. Pretty much NOTHING in the ""World War Z"" book appears in this movie (remember the good old days when charges of CRIMINAL FRAUD would be pressed and the movie producers sued for dishonest advertising practices, ah the good old days).The barest SNIFF of the flavor of the book and in that you'll feel deeply cheated. So now that this is out of the way, we move onto looking at the movie as a ""Stand-Alone Fame-Thief"" using the book as a way to coax viewers in to watch a knock-off lesser quality imitation.The story is pretty much Brad Pitt's character, ""Gerry Lane"", being a member of the United Nations with his family on the run from the devouring hordes. In that value, it is a fairly decent 1960's or 1970's style zombie-flick. If you rate it by itself, it is tolerable, but somewhat dumb, yet not painfully so.Of the locations referenced in the ""World War Z"" book (you know, the book that coaxed you into seeing this movie), only the escape from Israel is vaguely in parity to what the audience desired (much like the ""Walking Dead"" television series has turned into an episodic series about the occasional undead attack while being filled to the brim with packing peanuts of idiots grousing snootily at each other).Sadly ""World War Z"" the movie has borrowed heavily from ""28 Days Later"" (fast undead, 12 seconds to zombie conversion) and thrown all plausible physics out the window. What do you know about POWERLIFTERS? What can they lift at the record? 1268 lbs. Average human weight = 135 pounds, result, at your healthiest in perfect muscular fitness you can only support 9.3 humans. The human ladder in Israel would collapse at the height of 9 humans if all the humans were record-setting powerlifters. Undead, rotting humans, of average to lesser build, average weight? You'd be stomping through the ligaments at best when they hit 3 deep in Human Pyramid height. Let's not even get into the ""magnetic flying CGI corpse"" absurdity in the movie (worse than some of the Gary's Mod animations poking fun with Team Fortress).Well, onto the good points. Brad Pitt is handsome. His real-life freakshow wife Angela DUCKFACE and her mini-multicult ""Captain Planet"" stereotype squad are not in this movie (yeah imagine being Brad Pitt and going home to something that looks like The Octomom every night, UGH!). Some of the other bearded leading men are rather exceptionally handsome, especially in the rained out base in Korea. The zombies are a tolerable movie plot threat, but comically CGI-animated when dragged about in reticulated spline clumps by their wrists like a poor POSER 3 models. If you plug your ears you can enjoy Brad Pitt being handsome without any stupid plot being too distracting, unfortunately he never loses his pants and only lifts up his shirt for a bit near the end without going bare-chested. Calling the movie ""World War Z"" is a pretty huge stretch, but Brad Pitt remains delightfully handsome with an ever so cute pouty face.There is also some nonsense at the end about making themselves not-so-tasty to the undead by injecting themselves with a case of the Terminal Spinal Herpes which somehow is detected by MAGIC ZOMBIE VISION, but that is silly and dumb and only fit for 1950's corny Sci-Fi movies where the world is saved by aliens coming down with a case of Jersey Shore Gonorrhea from the Snookie-Monster. Ah, but Brad Pitt remains handsome for now, so if you like Brad Pitt then go see this movie as it is a tolerably forgettable ""action flick"" (which is a huge insult to the universe presented in the ""World War Z"" books). Oh well, vote with your dollars.

Please believe me that I don't always think that! Sometimes a movie is beter than its source material.I really enjoyed World War Z the book, so I was pretty interested in the movie, but this just totally missed the mark. I was hoping for a mocumentary style film that explored a zombie pandemic from the view points of various survivors around the world from different cultures. Instead we got this Hollywood action blockbuster thing. I guess if you are a big fan of the ""fast zombie"" style of horror and action this may be your cup of tea, but if you are looking for something that is more than just gore and action this movie is going to disappoint.All that being said, I did watch it, and I would probably watch it again if someone else wanted to have a move night or put something on in the background.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

First of all, the entire premise of this film has got all but no originality, and secondly the realization of it has not become a story so much as a transportation of Brad Pitt from one location to another, where his character - as the only one - keeps fighting off the film's uncontainable, ceaseless antagonists. The makers of the film seem to have mistaken quantity for quality, but without characteristics, limitations and purpose, these zombies have nothing to define them and nothing to give the story any resistance. The result is a film which starts in medias res, goes on to a pointless middle-part, peaks with a fine segment aboard a plane, and then ends with the hero's (and the committee of writers') one good idea, which still is too predictable and not really brings the story to any conclusion - other than the fact that there seems to be a sequel planned. Granted, the production is great and the film has drive, but that counts for little when it has nowhere to go. Brad Pitt, however, does a fine job - albeit mainly by looking so great at almost 50.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Let's just keep Brad Pitt out of Philadelphia to keep us all safe... Was the CIA guy also from 12 Monkeys? Yes, he was. 12 Monkeys is 💯×s better than WWZ. Just watch that again. (Apologies. I always struggle with ADHD when confronted with awful entertainment).WWZ ain't ALL bad... They spent plenty on the special-effects budget. Visually there's enough on which to feast, if you don't mind starving your other senses, especially your good sense. Here's some good sense violations: 1. Then they're not watching the walls in Jerusalem. Impossible. 2. He survives a plane crash. Just silly. 3. Send the guy with the shrapnel in his gut and the girl with one arm to retrieve the lab samples amidst 80 zombies. 4. Oh, Brad Pitt figures out how to fight the virus, when the world's top scientists cannot. What a hero. 5. I could go on. Dismissing the substandard nonsense that can show up in film comes down to personal taste. I think I have a medium tolerance, but when a threshold is breached I morph from tolerant to disgusted in a moment. I was disgusted before the half-way point.It seems that much of the plot was about working-in cool shots, as there's a lot of cool shots; but there's really no plot. That ain't cool. This is not optimal use of Brad Pitt either. I don't want to see Brad Pitt in a movie in which he's not snarky, or where we don't at least once hear that manic laugh. Some of their dramatic plot twists are almost funny, like the scientist dying by tripping... except it's not funny. It only feels empty. I don't like feeling empty. The only reason to watch this show is for a few clever special effects, but when has that ever been enough? I do enjoy a good zombie feature, but WWZ has too much rotting, festering decay to climb over in order to get to anything presentable.The list of better zombie features is too long to cite, but here's a smattering of recommendations:Resident Evil - Serious action;
Zombieland - Serious fun;
28 Days Later - Serious drama;
Shaun of the Dead - Serious laughs; and
I am Legend - Seriously, there's nothing wrong with that film. It's perfectly respectable.THE WALKING DEAD - This is about the family-we-choose fighting for survival;
The Last of Us - Serious science, serious drama, serious acting, serious introspection;
KINGDOM - Serious thrills and Detective work; and
Sweet Home - Seriously heart-wrenching and exciting.While I was looking up zombie features, I stumbled across a couple that I haven't seen yet, but these are immensely popular: ASH VS EVIL DEAD,
IN THE FLESH,
PUSHING DAISIES,
IZOMBIE,
DEAD SET, & SANTA CLARITA DIET. Perhaps watching some of these will cleanse the palate. I feel like I ate something bad.🐨","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Maybe because I expect big budget films to surprise me now and again instead of being just another explosion and gunshots fest. Man, wrong again.The beginning of the movie, up to the titles, didn't make my interest go away. I was hoping to see some of the controversy shown there in the movie itself. All that about how humans are destroying the planet, and how there're people still denying facts like the existence of global warming and such. However, right after we see the title ""World War Z"", I got this feeling of uneasiness, when the film goes into its second scene, the family kitchen. Setting, faces, mood, conversation... everything made me have an ominous feeling. It was only the very beginning, so it could just be me and my natural suspicion. The action doesn't take long to start. Explosions and frenzy festival for everybody. The movie goes on and my feeling of dread stays there, and continues to grow, slowly but surely. But, hey, only 30 minutes passed by. A lot can happen. It might not be just ANOTHER survival horror revival. I saw a glimpse of hope with the investigation itself begins. Now, we will have some seriousness rather than shooting, running and growling. Oops, wrong again. After that, I lost all hope: This movie is indeed just another action packed Hollywood shallow spawn.I admit it, I don't have any interest in zombies, I don't even know how there can be a zombie genre. It's always the same with anything with zombies in it. Great for the zombie fans, I suppose. I don't even know what this film it's supposed to be exactly. I recall they tried to put drama into it. How can anybody find anything related to zombies to be dramatic?? Zombies make me smile, at best. The way they move, the way they look, the noises they make. ""Zombieland"", see, that's an alright movie because they make fun of the zombies (and fail when they try to be dramatic!). It's sad -and somehow, ridiculous- how little we are told about the zombies in ""World War Z"", regarding scientific facts. OK, granted, it's stupid to talk science when we are talking about people who go undead after being bitten. Although, c'mon, they don't even try.My expectations about those controversies shown at the beginning being treated throughout the movie were also destroyed, the final message being HELP EACH OTHER. Wow, how's that for a moral dilemma.And what about Israel's issue and what the movie depicts over there... Now, THAT is funny. I would love to see Israel doing what the movie shows. This movie giving credit to what they have done in real life is already by itself bad enough.Please, please, don't make more zombie movies, series, comics... Nothing. There're plenty of real zombies already here in the non- fictional world. Now, let the hordes of zombie fanatics have a go at me. Because this movie, unfortunately, it's once again simply another zombie movie for zombie people. Even though zombies are ridiculous, I believe a real process of human zombiefication started many, many years ago. You want proof? Count how many zom..erm, people find this review unhelpful.To be fair, this flick have some few alright moments. Although a few OK moments don't make a movie good. This is a motion picture, no still photography.Bottom line: thoughtless action, plenty of explosions, bloody rush and even helicopters and jet fighters! Kids, be happy. Shallow plot, pathetic intents of dramatization sometimes... What else is there to say? Millions wasted on this... Brain dead, alright.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Firstly, the trailer is/was promising. Secondly, the rather quite forgotten Brad Pitt makes an appearance. And finally, if you are secretly an I Am Legend fan hunting for the sequel, this is good enough, I digress.The movie was well done in terms of keeping viewers on the edge of their seats, along with a few slightly humorous zombie sound effects. Brad Pitt seemed slighting passive for the role, however I take nothing away from him and his respected reputation. Personally I was going for a solid 8/10 until the movie started coming to a close, had me walking out scratching my head.This movie is ""not"" worth missing, although a lack of an effective story in my eyes, it had me sliding off of my seat.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

To start off, I'm watching this movie 2 years later to kinda dodge a lot of opinions and discussions around me, but I got some positive influence back in 2013 so I was hoping to see something 'different' in a good way. As usual with zombie apocalypse theme, you have the unknown virus which spreads in minutes or maybe more like seconds, I guess you can't avoid as it is a cause. After that you have the main protagonist who goes out there to fight for his family and humanity. OK, you have stereotypical zombie movie just based on book (which I haven't read, sorry), it's not that bad, but to make things bad mr. action and special effects crash the party, thanks guys you really liven things up. Even if you don't want to see it literally that none of this fiction of zombies running fast and climbing a huge wall is possible, maybe it's just me but my cynical mind just turns on and see this movie as another good way to get big money by buying the audience with cheap tricks... Even cock magic is better than this (good job Randy Marsh you pulled that off). I stopped watching movies a few years ago, because I realized that the whole film industry became a competition about money and surprising viewers with some bullshit (sorry for such a rogue word) I don't see real acting anymore, I mean genuine where actor/actress is making a huge effort to convince the audience.

Instead of following the intricate narrative structure of the novel, the film opts for a generic, paint-by-numbers approach that feels more like a video game than a thoughtful exploration of a global zombie apocalypse. It's like they took the basic premise of the book and stripped away everything that made it interesting, leaving us with a hollow shell of a story.The characters in World War Z are about as two-dimensional as a cardboard cutout. Brad Pitt's character, Gerry Lane, is supposed to be a former United Nations investigator, but you wouldn't know it from watching him stumble around like a clueless tourist. The supporting cast is equally forgettable, with barely enough screen time to establish any sort of emotional connection with the audience.And about the zombies, in the book, they're a terrifying force of nature, relentless and unstoppable. But in the film, they're reduced to nothing more than CGI spectacles, swarming around like a horde of angry ants. There's none of the tension or horror that made the zombies so terrifying in the novel - just a lot of flashy special effects and loud noises. Yes, there're some impressive set pieces and sweeping shots of destruction that are undeniably impressive. But there're also some glaringly obvious CGI that looks about as realistic as a cartoon. It's like they spent all their money on explosions and forgot to hire a decent special effects team.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I actually read the book it's based on by melanie brooks daughter most likely, you know the one with eleven fingers, sheesh do they even know how cheesy and fake they are? Enjoy the escapism and humor it won't last long.The zombie genre has been a tribe commentary and narrative control thing about Apocalypse from day one. Unfortunately when you fight God you will lose 100% of the time. And the family this, family that, is just mischpucka mafioso code word to their own nothing more. Someone said their family is those who share His Spirit, kind of makes sense here but in the ""as below"" way if you get my drift. I almost wouldn't know where to begin with this monstrosity of a movie there is so much messaging here. But let's say the pride based ""save ourselves"" stuff isn't going to work. I remember Daniels message to his captor which he had to translate for that pagan king. Roughly ""you have been judged, you are found wanting, you will be dispensed with"" it's of course phrased differently in the Book of Daniel but the meaning is the same and those who make these movies and all their other nonsense are on notice, nineveh or else; there are no other options.So really the androgynous ""gods"", in their own minds only, are under threat by ""those bad people"" in their own minds and need their tech and cartel organizations to save them, ain't going to happen. So Ms Shipster of the yew-N runs around like a jetsetter in a time of shutdown society, sound familiar?, to ""save"" everyone by her dubious skills and background, may as well be as real as all the CGI nonsense and other tricks used for a long time. So the Shippster and another gruesome androgyne from the ghetto that she saves do their thing, which isn't much tbh. Scientism is fake and even the real effects will fail at a certain time. Now I could mention all the other ""facts"" or presented as ""facts"" in this movie oh so smoothly but why bother, if you believe liars it's on your head, eat your blood and be happy until Justice comes calling.These autoevolutionary apes like the shipster are the real zombie virus all around us, but they look good to the simple eye. They're walking masks, and if you've seen them outside those masks you'd wretch, it's not hard to see indirectly though.Now from an action pov I suppose it's ok, the Dawn of the Dead from a few years earlier is a much better modern zombie based movie in almost every way. The CGI is ridiculous in this one as well and the nature of this all encompassing story kind of requires cgi though. I think a smaller story is better than this obvious message from the eleveners, this one is like a glorified Resident Evil really. That movie series also features another autoevolutionary cultist great ape lol.","0 out of 8 found this helpful.

For that reason the film was kind of flat - no tense moments followed by periods of calm, no successful playing with audience emotions.It seems that some things were thrown into the film ""just because,"" with no contribution to the forward momentum of the storyline or adding layers of character traits to otherwise flat characters.Pitt's character didn't really seem to have any weaknesses. He was certainly able to adapt and overcome in all the situations he found himself in. The other main character(s), zombies, were ""perfect"" antagonists. In other words, they were single-minded, with no significant flaws or weaknesses. (The few weaknesses that were mentioned were glossed over.) Because the zombies - antagonists - were 100% bad they were never-changing and never required much cleverness from Pitt and his zombie-vanquishing cohorts.To be honest, I shouldn't have watched this. It's not the kind of film I'm attracted to and that hobbles it out of the gate in my review here. But I figured ""Hey, Brad Pitt, a big budget and lots of effects, I'll take the risk."" Sometimes you take a risk and win... but not always. Maybe it's a good zombie film - zombie movie aficionados may give it two festering, half-rotted thumbs up (a nod to zombies, not to any trait of the fans).","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

With the exception of having Brad Pitt as the star, and having really fast-running Zombies, there's really nothing the differentiates this movie from your standard Zombie flick.Something happens...ooohh...things start exploding...ahh..crazy people start running around, and boy are they fast. The Zombie craze spreads. Luckily Brad has some sort of special skill, though it didn't look like it to me. He just basically flew around the world asking questions. Reminds me of The International, except with Zombies instead of murderers.The movie attempts to play to your heartstrings by plucking on his family's plight (wife and 2 girls). How sweet - Brad would rather be with them than flying around the globe saving the world as he gets chased by bloodthirsty Zombies. How boring that would be.This movie is pretty stupid, and the non-Zombies are sometimes very stupid, but that stupidity really added nothing to the plot or story. The acting was average. The cast was average. The screenplay was average. The CGI was above average because these Zombies really knew how to climb and run and kill people. If that makes it a good movie for you, jump right in.Finally, the kitsche ending makes you cringe as you say to yourself....jeez I hope they are not setting us up for WWZ2? Enjoy, if you dare...ooh zombies bad, non-zombies good!!! I recommend you pass and wait for it to come out free in your library.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I was blown away. I was out sailing by myself for a week, and I got really hooked. And, to be honest, a little scared, alone in my little boat, in the dark scerries of the swedish archipelago. Late august. Dark nights.Rarely have I wished for a book to be rendered as a movie. But this time I did. And the only thing I have to say about the film in this review is that it's a massive let down. It's got nothing of that fantastic atmosphere. It is a missed opportunity. I hope some day a good crew will turn it into a tv-series instead.The movie ""World War Z"" has got nothing to do with the book, and as such it's watchable, but also forgettable.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Possibly people with such a low IQ, that they would not even realize they are being manipulated by unscrupulous Hollywood executives whose only goal is to exploit young people and separate them from their cash.Yes, I enjoy a midnight movie and role-playing occasionally, but not with nincompoop plots and dialogues like this turkey. Brad Pitt should be ashamed of himself for taking a role like this; he is a much better actor than that. All of his other role choices had been reasonable up to this unfortunate catastrophe. Even the Zombie-Loving young reviewers mentioned the plot was something done a 1000 times before.

Coherence is lost. Impact is lost.

At this point I did a double take, looked around the cinema to see if anyone else was as bemused, and carried on watching. The confused frown never fully left my face.

When will script writers & directors start to realise that each scene has to make logical sense to the audience for them to invest their belief in the possibility this could happen, as we are willing to accept outlandish ideas so long as characters act realistically.Brad Pitt's character ""Gerry Lane"" comes across as an idiot, who ( with the knowledge he has at the time in the movie ) puts lots of innocent people's lives in danger by acting completely irrationally so he comes across as a selfish jerk we don't like. There was no need for the Director & script writers to do that as the audience want heroes that we like & want to root for too.For some reason the script writers want us to think that though ""Gerry Lane"" is incredibly stupid & dumb he some how is well respected by his peers & former bosses for past history, so is vital to save even though he has no real knowledge of how to help & on top of that only ""Gerry Lane"" can figure out how to save the day when specialists in their field are too dumb to be able to work out the same conclusions for themselves. ""Gerry Lane"" being an idiot savant just doesn't work for the audience.There are many plot holes & ridiculous scenarios that are used to try to cause drama & move the story along, plus moments where decisions made make no sense & unnecessary risks are taken for no logical reason, as script plagued by bad writing.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

These zombies seem to make use of their muscle structure, form and function which allow them to run, jump and climb to complete their objective of spreading the virus inside them. The problem is their objective isn't to eat as much as it is to spread their plague with a predator like aggression so there is very little to no gore save a few teeth marks and a crushed zombie head or 2.You'll know the moment that the first attack starts if you've made a good decision to see this movie or not. If you're unimpressed by the concept, then it's safe to quit watching the rest of the movie and find a spoiler alert if you can't already guess what will happen. For those who are impressed, hold on to those thoughts through the rest of the show because the 2 hour long movie doesn't get that much more interesting even though you can feel the potential is there! Gerry Lane played by Brad Pitt is a former investigator for the UN and tasked with finding patient 0 where the virus originated to help make a cure for this pandemic. He travels to a few countries to investigate what they know which all seem to lead to dead ends so he's forced to rely less on protocol for finding the answers and more on observation to find a more creative solution.

In fact, not a single scene in WWZ gets by without borrowing from some all-too-recent-past ""A-list"" blow-em-up apocalyptic blockbuster. Upon its conclusion, I found myself longing to watch Ed Wood (the anti-WWZ)--a film that was blatantly constructed around one of the worst B-movies of all time, yet redeemed itself with ready doses of freshness, fun and yes-- originality. Alas movielovers, those days are long gone and the pre-fab vampiric zombie hobbits have taken control. To be fair, WWZ masks its weaknesses (read: tired constructs) well and even *transforms* them into strengths at times. It also held my attention for one hour, forty-eight minutes and thirty-nine seconds (though not a second longer). Thus, I must overlook the film's raging typhus and perhaps even call it a success (As one man said, ""Filmmaking is illusionist work.""). Yet the better parts of me seem to have flown around this one like a river which soon forgets anything that doesn't move along with it. 5.1/10","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Coveting a Z is far-fetched expectation because the whole premise has more flaws than 2013's number of mega-flops.Starting with fast-paced thrills which only looks like zombie apocalypse turns into a parade of improbable plot twists. Many factors which are stitched together in this gimmick are flawed: the character of Brad Pitt in the whole drama, the zombie premise, the inconclusive dumb kind of an ending. I have never seen such an incomplete film made solely on a single ""twist"" factor which only comes around towards the end, minutes before the end credits. It makes the whole 2-hour adventure a circus show where not only zombies, but also the people confronting them are dumb.The starting credits showing photographs of cities around the world kinda intrigued me and I sat there revving my expectation up. Then, the pretentious plot started its fabricated course; as if every single turn in the screenplay was thought with a well-decorated closure i.e. ""the twist.""Brilliant photography & fine CGI makes it pretty watchable but it is highly uncertain if you would enjoy it, accounting the huge list of epic zombie movies we have in catalog...BOTTOM LINE: It would be unwise if Brad Pitt is the single factor you would consider to watch a film constructed on an ambitious novel and popular cliché.Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

""But you are not.. so we skip to the sensible part, which means:it was a cool movie, but hampered.""""Take it away,"" Kristl said.""Oh.. well I liked Brad Pitt.

Each setting is but briefly used, no character development or story arc has time to develop before they fly off to the next scene.

Each setting is a whole scene with characters and a background and we skip the scene before we get 'settled in',"" Henry said."".. which would not have been too bad if they had Brad accompanied by a group of people. Like they do after Israel with Segen.

I mean they made a wall. It is not something you just put up in a week. Israel building a wall would not go unnoticed even if it took them a week,"" Henry said.""I think that was implied,"" Kristl laughed.""The movie has many nice settings and a good cast, but the story seems to have collapsed under it's own weight and for sure the script writers are to blame for the shortcomings.. I read that originally the movie was different with a final battle in Russia. Which stands to reason as the plane that takes them from Israel is Russian.""""So an okay movie, but with many shortcomings. But saved by Brad Pitt.""""We could call it maybe World War B?""""Sounds good to me.""""Even if you are not inclined that way.""""Oh God, I will get that thrown in my face from now on.

The sense of global devastation was realised much more effectively ( and much more cheaply) in the Resident Evil films. Resident Evil also worked far better as action movies with a zombie theme.The script is full of gaping examples of stupidity that make it impossible to identify with the characters, especially Pitt's who is supposed to be a well educated experienced UN investigator. He makes absolutely moronic decisions time and time again.The acting is generally substandard, the direction woeful ( its almost impossible to see what is happening in the action sequences)and the audience I saw it with laughed several times at things weren't meant to be funny.Also, for the most expensive zombie movie ever, its hard to see where the money was spent. Many scenes supposedly set in the USA were obviously shot in Glasgow and look nothing like Philadelphia.Watch Resident Evil or 28 days later on DVD instead.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"","","Decent film; chaos & human landscape","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2863405/?ref_=tt_urv","chaos-rampant","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur17699578/?ref_=tt_urv","4 September 2013","The good news is they salvaged this, because usually when you hear about reshoots the thing has more fundamental issues than a little repair can solve. They did it here, which is reason enough to celebrate because who needs a ruined film? It's tense, it's efficient in the right spots, if not a particularly great film. It adequately conveys the chaos and desperation, though we lose Romero's claustrophobia for disaster movie scope.The bad news is you can see the stitches and damage left on the walls by all the repairing they had to do. I assume the ridiculous points were inherited from the book. But they added explanatory monologues that chaperone us from one place to the other, announcing the stakes and what needs to be done; none of it really necessary. Bad decision that reveals a studio pandering to its generic conception of some brainless audience.It must have been a tough shoot anyway. They had to film panicked crowds in nearly every other scene, staging the panic. They had to touch it up probably frame by frame to enhance the spasmodic 'zombie' motion. And they had to weld that with digital footage of mayhem, presenting it as one world. I'm sure many a perfectionist would have bulked at the fundamentally chaotic idea.Now if we're lucky, in such a film we have a somewhat revelatory chaos. Isn't this what separates Romero from Italian knockoffs of his films? a sense of common fabric with the world we know, a plausible extension.We have it here. One thing is the first violence; the original sin. Contagion from last year humorously rendered this as some absurd, indifferent machination in nature which down the line destroys the world. Romero in Night had posited something from the stars, abstract, bigger. Here, the cause is resigned to be unknowable. It fits, if we are to have a mirror of life. The hottest news topic of the day is that the Congress approved US intervention in Syria; if we were to look for some original cause in that bloodshed, what would it be? Meaningless to even try. (you'll see that pundits will go as far back as it supports their storytelling agenda of how the world is put together, constructing destiny)However, more interesting is to see how this unknowable first cause propagates through the world, ripping stuff. Abstractly seen, from one of the many helo-shots, movement creates movement. Violence replicates itself through human fabric like surfs through water, the energy rippling through. There's so much flowing human landscaping here that you won't fail to notice this pattern. Of course, later on we find that it's some viral pathogen actively 'seeking' its biological continuation. We always have to fall back, and hold on, to some objective world. But for a while this opens a portal in perception. In the Israel segment, our guy first notices that zombies will run past a boy who stays immobile, perceiving here the key to the problem. Here also the water metaphor is used, a riverflow around a rock. Unwittingly, the filmmakers illustrate a cool thing; stillness disarms violence; violence being motion attracted to and constantly creating itself. I recommend reading a bit on waves in general, maybe nature's greatest work of art. Not the film's purpose, just an observation. But interesting of itself is that we have switched to fast zombies, and fast 'subjective' camera to capture the motions. It could be because this heightens plausibility and thus placement. It could be that we altogether have a faster perception of things than even 30 years ago, hugely so. Do we lose the stillness though? I mean broadly in the sense of a contemplative space.Pitt is totally out of place here, he has that smirk in the eye that does not speak of the hardened man he plays.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Nevertheless, it was entertaining and kept me interested throughout the entire film. The zombies were terrifying: extremely fast with vicious snarls and a knack for jump-tackling their adversaries. There were a few scenes (particularly one on a passenger airplane) that I considered 'cool', but I was really thrown off by how everything Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) did was near perfect. It reminded me of John Cusack in 2012 and how he perfectly escapes each catastrophic scene.All in all, World War Z will never be grouped with movies like Dawn of the Dead or 28 Days Later, and it will surely receive hate from Romero zombie purists, but for fans of horror/survival movies, you'll surely be on the edge of your seat.SLOW ZOMBIES RULE, FAST ZOMBIES DROOL.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

"","","Neither Scares Nor Thrills! World War Zzzzzzzzz!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3317554/?ref_=tt_urv","CinemaClown","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20018357/?ref_=tt_urv","15 September 2015","Lacking the chilling sense of dread, escalating tension & disturbing gore that usually comes associated with this subgenre of horror, World War Z inclines more towards the action genre than horror, packs in almost all the elements of a generic summer blockbuster, and as far as the subject of zombie apocalypse goes, this is one of the lamest movies out there.Based on the novel of the same name, World War Z tells the story of retired UN investigator Gerry Lane who, along with his family, narrowly manages to escape the zombie outbreak in his city but soon finds himself on a new mission that requires him to travel around the globe in order to find a possible cure to the pandemic that is quickly annihilating the human race.Directed by Marc Forster (Finding Neverland & Quantum of Solace), World War Z takes the living dead of 28 Days Later..., injects them with plenty of steroids, gives them the benefit of CGI and allows them to go completely lunatic on the screen which, instead of working as a chaotic nightmare, looks too artificial to have any effect and eliminates the seriousness the movie was aiming for.The screenplay fails to provide any character depth, the ones that matter are carved out of cardboards, the story lacks any sense of direction, and the ending is pretty weak. Sure it's fast paced & action-packed but it's just empty visuals with nothing at stake. Performances are dull, Brad Pitt's star presence helps a bit but his input looks like he was asked to utter his lines without rehearsing any of his scenes.On an overall scale, World War Z is a highly disjointed mess that keeps piling one segment over another without any idea of where it's headed, neither scares nor thrills, and is simply as forgettable as any typical summer blockbuster. The concept is promising on a certain level but the execution is so disappointing that the movie as a whole is a waste of time & money. Watch it only if you can't resist a Brad Pitt film. Highly mediocre!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.
