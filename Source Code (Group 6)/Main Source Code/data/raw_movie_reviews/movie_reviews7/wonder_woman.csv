"8","/10","Much better than expected superhero action drama.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4277340/?ref_=tt_urv","paulclaassen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2263198/?ref_=tt_urv","10 August 2018","I must be honest, it took me a while before I finally decided to watch this, as I'm not a big Hollywood superhero movie fan. Well, I was pleasantly surprised. Gil Gadot is excellent as Wonder Woman and lends credibility to the naive title character. The chemistry between her and Chris Pine was wonderful and made for a very believable love story. It felt very natural and romance between them seemed inevitable.As for the plot, I enjoyed the way the Amazonian women's back story was told, as well as Diana's (Wonder Woman). The visuals and photography are incredible! This is a visual spectacle. I loved the humorist dialogue, which was genuinely funny and never over the top or slapstick. Gil Gadot is just fabulous.This superhero movie had a very realistic feel to it with the added bonus of feeling and emotion. There are so many truths in this film humanity should take note of. The film has a very unexpected ending compared to most superhero movies, and that's what I honestly loved about the film.","49 out of 54 found this helpful.

Its strength lay in Gal Gadot's compelling portrayal of the iconic heroine, infusing the character with both strength and vulnerability. The film's cinematography showcased visually stunning action sequences, with Themyscira's lush landscapes serving as a standout. The supporting cast, particularly Chris Pine, added depth to the story with strong performances. While the music and visuals were effective, they didn't always leave a lasting impression. Overall, ""Wonder Woman"" delivered a powerful and long-overdue female-led superhero story, though it had some minor weaknesses in terms of music and visual impact that kept it just shy of perfection.","7 out of 7 found this helpful.

She is unconcerned with her looks and trying to impress others, and way more concerned with saving the world as she was meant to do. This film really showed the process of her becoming a true heroine! She loves, she protects, she saves. Wonder Woman is a great character and I think she was cast beautifully! She looks ""other-worldly"" beautiful and fit the part so well. The film was written well to show her innocence of the ""real"" world, her joy of seeing it and it's people for the first time, and her passion for saving us all!Team Wonder Woman Forever!This is a film I could watch over and over. :D","21 out of 26 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Not a wonder, not a blunder","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3755873/?ref_=tt_urv","TheLittleSongbird","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur20552756/?ref_=tt_urv","16 July 2017","As someone who does enjoy superhero films when done right, there are some good ones out there as well as some disappointing ones. Enjoyed the character of Wonder Woman as a kid, and always felt compared to other superhero characters that she deserved her own film.Which she gets in this 2017 effort directed by Patty Jenkins. Is 'Wonder Woman' as good as the hype and a wonder of a film? Not to me, there are a few things that stop it from being even better. Does it deserve the negativity in a lot of the comments here? While it is easy to see why people would be disappointed, as it could have been better, my answer would be no and that some of the hate is over the top.There are problems here in 'Wonder Woman'. Part of it is to do with pacing, the film starts a little dull in places and later on as more happens in the story it felt rushed and at times it affects the storytelling which has its muddled moments.The ending is clich√©d and anti-climactic and some of the characters feel underdeveloped, especially the underused and underwritten villain.However, 'Wonder Woman' is mostly an exceptionally made film, apart from instances of frenetic editing, with a lot of atmosphere in the production design and lighting, audacious photography and special effects that are super slick. The music has a haunting sense of mood and rousing energy, and Jenkins directs with an understanding of the titular character and accommodating the performing of Gal Gadot.Script has some witty humour, heartfelt sentiment and also takes itself seriously without making the mistake of previous BC Extended Universe (of which 'Wonder Woman' is by far the best, actually being a good film) of being too grim and dark. The action is stirring and often spectacular in spectacle.'Wonder Woman's' story has its faults but most of it is heartfelt and thrilling. It does the character of Wonder Woman justice with a genuinely interesting back-story that makes her a compellingly real and easy-to-relate-to character who you admire for all her strengths and flaws.Gadot is superbly cast as Wonder Woman, creating a character that really stands out among the rest of the superhero line in terms of gender and her ideals. Chris Pine is amusing, commanding and likable with great chemistry with Gadot, while Danny Houston clearly enjoys himself as the villain. The rest of the cast do very solidly.Overall, not a wonder but a long way from a blunder. 7/10 Bethany Cox","26 out of 38 found this helpful.

I was a bit worried. DC has shown a.... shall we call it tendency? -- to darken every comic book character, to the point where Suicide Squad had everyone with a sad backstory. It made me miss the cheery disposition of Caesar Romero's Joker. Yes, I get it that you're a sociopath. Can't you enjoy it?Wonder Woman avoids that. In the midst of the horrors of the Great War, there are real jokes, and moments of kindness and great deeds inspired by naive morality.Visually, the movie combines the splash panels and covers of the Dark Horse era of DC, with some canny casting choices among the secondary characters. Lucy Davis looks like Etta Candy from the late WWII comics era; Ewen Bremner looks like Charlie from the same era; both push the comic book look to the edge, without falling over.Miss Gadot turns out to be a very capable screen performer, with dark, expressive eyes. Chris Pine restrains himself as her leading man. If the screenplay sometimes falls into the current hackneyed tropes, it plays nimbly with others, like Chekhov's Gun. If the final battle is another round of Rock-Em-Sock-Em Robots, the earlier battle scene, fought in righteous anger, made me think about the Angel of Mons.","13 out of 15 found this helpful.

This is the Wonder Woman movie we've been waiting for.One of the first superheroes ever created in comics and the very first female superhero, Wonder Woman is among the most recognizable superheroes in history.It is outrageously bold and confident, insanely fun and thrilling, powerfully dramatic and delightfully amusing, all rolled into one epic superhero outing. It sports some of the greatest action scenes and visuals of any superhero movie to date, many of which have been saved from the marketing in order to serve as delicious surprises when you finally see the movie. The cast are magnificent, especially Gal Gadot's lead turn as the world's first female superhero. And director Patty Jenkins has instantly proven herself one of the genre's finest filmmakers.Gal Gadot's casting was like a miracle for the studio, as her performance is instantly the stuff of legends. Gadot does a magnificent job with this complex mixture of emotions and motivations in Diana, as well as the many grand fight and action sequences, I can't imagine anyone else in the role.she is Wonder Woman now, through and through. Chris Pine actually delivers his second-best career performance here.The action sequences in Wonder Woman set a new standard for the genre. It has excellent hand-to-hand superhero combat on par with Batman's warehouse scene in Batman v Superman or Cap's fights against Batroc and Bucky in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. But it also has epic war scenes, fantastic sword-and-sandal battles (the Amazon battle on the beach is an instant classic), and big-scale superhero action set pieces bringing down buildings and demonstrating the full scale of superheroism and super-villainy.I loved Matthew Jensen's cinematography in Wonder Woman, and how it established different visual tones and styles for different settings and different acts in the film.","6 out of 7 found this helpful.

Since it's sequel has been and gone much of the hope has seeped away for as the DCU has been under minded by WB it has not been able to shape anything with consistency.With Gal Gadot as WW the star shines very bright and Chris Pine and all other supporting cast are well drawn but plots are a little underdeveloped and when the big bad is the god of war, Aries - the scale seemed small on the screen whilst the jeopardy on screen, whilst it comes to pass, feels more of a foot note than a truly mortal affair.DC have overpowered heroes like Superman but Steve Trevor deserves more emotional impact on screen given his choices and the villains are given too little attention. The red herring villain didn't work well enough and a more 3D female villain would have sufficed with Aries as her muse and empowered. Perhaps if Jenkins had shown the adversarial nature of women here, then ww84 would've had not misfired on so many levels.Snyder clearly had a game plan that was untrusted. So when I recall this film and recognise there are some great stand out scenes that come to mind. By the end credits we have a self sufficient film that could've been more but is not wholly disappointing like the follow up.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

In lieu of Daddario, I guess Gal Gadot isn't a terrible alternative, but I doubt that the film would have been great whoever played the title role: the story, by Zack Snyder, is a by-the-numbers exercise in superhero banality, while director Patty Jenkins goes for CGI-laden style over substance, her film reliant on flashy overblown set-pieces in which our heroine proves totally impervious to harm, whether it be poison gas attack or being hit broadside by a flying tank. With Wonder Woman able to withstand any onslaught, the film is totally lacking in excitement.Having watched a handful of other DCU movies, including the recent over-rated effort that was Shazam!, I'm still waiting to be impressed. Casting David Thewlis as the villain definitely isn't the way to go...4.5/10, generously rounded up to 5 for IMDb - Mindless generic popcorn superhero nonsense.

Diana Prince gears up ultimately out of love - which doesn't sound like something that'd fit very well in a war movie. Part of the reason this movie is so good is that it had big boots to fill. The DC movies haven't been stellar up to this point, and their inherent dreariness hasn't helped matters. And here's a movie with competent direction, gorgeous visuals and a lead actress that's fully up to the challenge. Gal Gadot instills in her character honor, innocence, and the necessary color to really bring a comic book movie to the screen.In other words, it's everything I was hoping for in a Wonder Woman film. It doesn't feel like it was ground out of a sausage factory, and really manages to do everything right. Just to give context, this is coming from a guy who's pretty burnt out on the genre. I loved this movie.8/10","78 out of 127 found this helpful.

But a standalone movie? This was the ultimate test and though I think she did well I believe her proper debut failed on a lot of fronts.A tweeked version of her origin story Wonder Woman is full of famous faces and fantastic choices for the most part, it had a tsunami of funding and a competent lead. So what went wrong?The same as Batman vs Superman in my opinion, the DC Universe is simply not getting off to a good start. Flashy, cheesy and with some awful awful dialogue Wonder Woman failed to impress.I'm not saying its a bad film, I'm just saying for every good scene there are 5 average ones and a couple of stinkers.What took me back was the CGI, this is a AAA movie so why are there so many crappy looking shots? Truly unforgivable considering the budget, the script is weak, the story is predictable and the whole thing is somehow cheesier than the original television series (And that's saying something).I went in expecting gold but came out with mildly tarnished bronze at best, I wanted to like this I really did but am so unimpressed I'm just going to assume Justice League will be seven shades of abyssmal.The Good:Great scoreWell castThe Bad:Some choreography is offSome bizzarely bad cgiVery different from the original storyBarely connects to the universe they are trying to createThings I Learnt From This Movie:Each year judging by ratings people are easier and easier to pleaseI always consider Tom Cruise unconvincing in action scenes, he looks outstanding compared to David ThewlisDC is not going to be catching up to Marvel, ever.

In the first blockbuster superhero film featuring Wonder Woman since the 1970's, we see Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) sitting in her office, remembering how it all started, and we are thrown back to the Island of the Amazons, where she is a little girl. We see her grow up and go through her training, with her aunt played admirably by the Princess Bride herself, Robin Wright, making an epic comeback. After which, a series of events lead her to meet a man and leave the island to join the war effort in England. Gal Gadot played Wonder Woman and she was truly something special. While everyone got caught up in the hype of the fact that DC made a good movie, that didn't center around Batman, and the fact that this film was centered on a female superhero, they failed to see just how unoriginal the story actually was. As I was watching the scenes on this Island, with Diana growing up, not knowing what she really was, and leaving before she was ready, I was very much reminded of Thor, but that was just the first hour of the film. I thought things would get better but they didn't. She becomes this unexpected larger than life hero in World War I, much in the way that Captain America did in World War II. Both of them fought really bad guys who weren't the ""main"" bad guy behind the war, and then there is the whole God angle, which brings us right back to Thor again. The film was so well done, I think it is more than time we had a strong female hero that young girl can emulate and look up to, and I thought Gal Gadot was a breath of fresh air, who gave an outstanding performance. As far as originality goes, to me it just wasn't there, as it seems the writers took elements from two of the more popular Marvel films and mashed them together. The Bottom Line, Wonder Woman is absolutely worth seeing, however I'm all for original ideas, and I want to see something different, especially at a time when a new superhero film is coming out every month.","9 out of 11 found this helpful.

The island is somewhere near Greece but hidden from view by a strange fog for normal people. We follow how Diana grows up to become one of the greatest amazon to have ever lived. On the day of her final training something strange happens: a German plane from the first world war breaks through the fog surrounding Themyscira and crashes into the sea. Diana rescues the man (Steve, a British spy played by Chris Pine) inside the plane, but he is pursued by German soldiers who also break through the fog. The Germans are quickly defeated by the mighty amazon warriors and learn from Steve that the whole world is currently fighting a great war. Diana thinks it must be the work of Ares, the god of war and that it is time to wield the god killer sword to put an end to Ares once and for all. Together with Steve and his friends she leaves the island of Themyscira to go to horrific front of the first world war, trying to find and defeat Aris. I went into this movie a bit skeptical, because I wasn't impressed by Batman VS Superman where (the modern version) Wonder Woman made her entrance. But the character is interesting so I was curious how her origin story panned out. The start of the movie was a bit to serious/high fantasy for me but once Chris Pine enters the picture, it get's a lot lighter in tone and I started to like it a lot more. I really like Pine in The scenes where Diana enters London and get's in contact with 1910's civilization are hilarious and Gal Gadot does a fine job playing someone who's from a different world. I also liked the supporting cast who play Steve's friends, lot's of humor in those scenes. The action scenes where mostly very well done. Cool slow motion effects and very good stunt work. My only gripe was that the CGI doubles of wonder woman and her opponents where a bit to obvious in a few scenes. And like in many comic book movies, this movie also suffered from a bad guy that was not impressive at all. The final confrontation was a bit to predictable and way to much CGI effects for my taste. But there was an emotional touch in the ending which was well done and unexpected. Wonder woman is an enjoyable action movie with great action scenes and some good laughs. Recommended if your in for an entertaining action movie with some fantasy elements.","29 out of 53 found this helpful.

The storyline follows the rise of Diana among the Amazonians who are a group of females on an island isolated from civilization. When a human appears during the World War it springs Diana into action to discover what could be behind the war and how she can stop it. This movie is directed by Patty Jenkins (Monster) and stars Gal Gadot (Death on the Nile), Chris Pine (Star Trek), Robin Wright (Forest Gump) and Ewen Bremner (Trainspotting). The storyline for this is very well done and does a great job of introducing Wonder Woman as a character.

Yes, another super hero movie to kick off the summer blockbuster season. This time it isn't Marvel cranking out the comic book, cinematic feature, but their rivals DC studios. With its recent shaky track record, the DC cinematic universe hasn't gotten the best publicity in terms of quality. So, the studio has decided to get the leading lady herself to pave the way. Yes, today's review is on Wonder Woman starring Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. Can this movie break the bad luck streak of DC/WB studios? Robbie K here to share some opinions on the matter, so let's get started, shall we?LIKES1. Gal Gadot is incredible and steals the show with her poise, pizazz, and acting talents. A fantastic casting direction that really brings the woman to wonder to life in beauty, ferocity, and bouts of heroism (a.k.a. kicking bad guy butt). Acting, stunts, and an on-point delivery of her lines makes this actress one of the tops in my book!2. The action is on point (for most of the movie) filled with impressive displays of weaponry, martial arts, and historical warfare. Wonder Woman's battles held such emotion, managing to bring the suspense all while delivering that feel good, post battle high, you might have gotten from reading a comic book. The team brings some fast-paced thrills we have wanted for almost a year and a half.3. A good representation for girls. I may have already said this, but this movie targets a wide variety of audience members in some form or manner. Yet this reviewer has to give props for the design of a character that is certainly worthy of representing the female super heroes and inspiring the female population that they certainly can do anything. 4. Comedic timing: It's not going to be a super hero movie (at least in this day and age) without some laughs to break up the tension. Wonder Woman continues this trend, filling the void with well-timed one-liners, a few awkward encounters that often deal with sex, and some slap-stick gimmicks that do the job well. 5. Character Development: I know most super hero movies have this element, but there is something about Wonder Woman that stood out to me. This film managed to spin Diana's character development into a roller coaster ride of feelings that almost made me tear up. Her journey to discovering herself and her role into this new world was poetically portrayed, using multiple angles to get the job done. It could have also been due to the powerful soundtrack, the visual effects, or maybe Gadot's acting, but it really worked for me. 6. Fast Pace: We all know those movies that drag (and yes, I'm talking much of DC's library). Not the case for this film. The nearly 150-minute run time flew by for much of the movie having me at one point saying, ""Dang, it's already been 90 minutes."" Not something I often say. DISLIKES:1. Unoriginality: You'll find that Wonder Woman shares a lot with Captain America: First Avenger. The set-up, setting, and build up almost matching outside of the weapon of choice and martial arts moves. Certainly, not the biggest limitation, but something that others have been bothered by. 2. Almost pointless crew: The crew that joins Diana held such promise in the picture, but it was dropped so hard in this movie. Outside of Chris Pine, the other members do little for the overall mission outside of a few throws, some ""tracking"" and mainly comedic relief. There were hints at character development and deeper dynamics, but they fizzled out faster than sparkler at 4th of July. I know, this movie is about Wonder Woman, but why even include these guys if that was the goal. 3. Preachy: Some reviews state the whole feminism/males are pigs is overdone, and to an extent I agree. Yet the bigger dislike was the preachy monologues that sometimes plagued this film. A few times the heat of the moment was lost in a display of self-reflection, which is great, but not in the midst of a battlefield. Some of these moments also had that eye-rolling factor for me. 4. Overuse of CGI: I like special effects, I like stunts, but I don't like overuse of a gimmick. The slow-motion interludes during the action scenes added some cool emphasis to Wonder Woman's skills (alongside some cool finishing moves). Somewhere along the production, someone got a little trigger happy with the effect and used a little too much for me, and soon started disrupting the cool stunts they had Gal do. In addition, there were some special effects that were a bit cheesy and took the edge off of Wonder Woman. Learn from Michael Bay people, too much of special effects makes for many jokes. 5. The ending: Don't turn away, hear me out. The ending is great on many levels (emotional, prowess, role model, and morals). However, it lost the momentum the first few fights had with them, trading suspense for flashy special effects, drawn out banter, and unimpressive choreography. Sort of felt like the ending to X-men apocalypse where the bad guys bark was worse than his bite. The VERDICT:Wonder Woman delivers on many levels and breaks the mediocre displays that DC has cranked out over the last year. It's emotional, it's dynamic, it's fun, and it provides a solid role model for admirable heroes. I feel the movie met most of my expectations and I was happy with the overall product. It's far from perfect though, and still has a few things to tighten up (like developing other characters, balancing the CGI use, and keeping the momentum going). Still, I have to recommend this one for a theater visit, especially you comic lovers out there.","127 out of 220 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Very linear, DC got it right, a female strong hero on the spotlight, she's Wonder Woman","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3720873/?ref_=tt_urv","ElDiomedes","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur23569002/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2017","Reading the reviews here. Either they are bowing down to the movie or just hating blindly. Not sure how many have actually seen it. Very good movie after all the disappointment from the past DCEU movies.Seeing all the trailers and featurettes, very little was left for imagination, but those didn't disappoint. The movie is about the journey of a demigod from Themyscira, where it's all bright and shiny to the real world, which is torn by war, greed, hatred and darkness. Diana walks in as the light.Getting her influence from Donner, Patty Jenkins got it right. What it means to be a hero, what does it mean to inspire..and the quest for the Amazon beauty to become the light in the darkness. Strength, sorrow, motivation, humanity, hope and loss forges the path to be the ultimate hero she's meant to be.Gal Gadot surprised me. Most of her past performances were, well, sub par. Finally she's in the spotlight. She did pretty well. Although she has a long way to go, everyone begins somewhere. This movie is for her. Kudos for her strong performance, specially the fight sequences.We all deserved this movie. While not a masterpiece, but good enough to be the stepping stone for women empowerment, and a proper story for a demigod and one of the most popular female superhero who can go toe to toe with the all powerful Superman. I just can't wait to see her interactions and chemistry with the big blue, and how they co ordinate, being the two gods that they are. DCEU is back on track.Apart from her, Chris Pine as Steve Trevor shined, and he is straight from the comic book pages. He's a good actor, not surprising.Despite all the positives, it has it's flaws. Some scenes were too long and unnecessarily dragged. Diana's chemistry with Steve could have been better. Dr Poison was equivalent to Kaecilius' henchmen..wasted.A good ending satisfies all, after the emotional turbulence audiences go through. This movie did justice to that.That being said, Man of Steel still remains the favorite DCEU movie for me. But perhaps that's because I'm biased to Supes.7/10.","29 out of 55 found this helpful.

The development is unexpected and takes you for a turn after the villain is found but the philosophical real villain remains. Here ""Wonder Woman"" shines in its thoughtfulness about the hero/villain construct, and gives the intellect something to gnaw on.However the last arc, though magnificent, doesn't quite excuse the vague mythology getting to that point or some disturbing questions such as why Wonder Woman is so quick to be an American hero rather than the hero of humanity she claims to be. As well as some thin areas such as exactly how invincible is Diana? Can bullets kill her? And then other loose ends such as the ragtag team Chris Pine's character puts together-were they really necessary, and did their stories conclude in a satisfying way?And then some casting choices were a bit unusual. Like for Ares. You'll see what I mean.For me Gal Gadot does a fine job, but perhaps doesn't have a big range. But she does give her all and embodies the character in her determination, innocence and her grappling with the question of whether to be humanity's hero. And of course her physical attributes! I think acting across the emotive Chris Pine certainly helped bring out her best acting moments.All in all a much deeper film than expected, but not without its parts which we all just look past.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

Compared to the last installments, it's probably the best. But that's not saying much.To this movies credit, I gotta say that it has an honest heart. it's the first time that they actually feel honest about a movie. This one is not trying to elevate Wonder Woman to something unrealistic (considering the character that she is), it's very grounded, and overall a very enjoyable dumb summer movie.Having said that. It's not perfect. Like I said. It's dumb, but with a heart. The acting is OK for the most part (even though Robin Wright's helmet thing looked embarrassing and was hard to take her performance seriously just for that). Gal Gadot was OK, Chris Pine was OK. The rest of the cast was kind of there. The plot was a lazy combination of Thor and the first Captain America movie. Pretty dull in my opinion. The way the plot moves is very dumb and most of the conflict is avoidable if some characters would just listen, otherwise they look very stupid, even if the outcome was the same, giving them some common sense would have given them some substance. It just didn't happen, but I give that to the lazy writing. The villain was uninspiring, not a big surprise for this kind of movie, so you know that it comes with lazy CG and motivation. He just serves to have a super claustrophobic final battle filled with explosions and stuff. One kind of head scratching moment for me was that Wonder Woman was trying to avoid the greatest and most violent conflict ever: WWI. So the stakes seem stupid when you know that WWII was way worse and knocking on the door. We are obviously not going to see her react to that. With a big dope face realizing that the war she thought was the worse was pretty much the beginning. Oh, and the music. I hate it for the most part. I hate her theme. It's way too manipulating and forced.The things that I would have liked this movie to be are way to many to be listed here. So I leave it at: it was OK, not great, kind of good, very stupid and face-palming. but nothing as sinful as Suicide Squad. And to it's credit it's the first time a DCEU movie actually makes more or less sense.And to address those who believe that there is a big presence of quality on the film. No, there is not. It's just the first movie from the DCEU that is not complete S H I T. That doesn't make it good.","25 out of 49 found this helpful.

On one end, a powerful but na√Øve woman slowly emerges, armed with a shield, a sword and a bundle of conviction to put an end to all of it. In this one sure-to-be iconic moment, the world is (re-)introduced to its new favorite superhero. Wonder Woman, an unabashed woman-empowerment film, uses its pre-established muscle for good: to give us a blockbuster full of true excitement, true humor and true heart. Being a wartime-superhero film, we expect a certain quality of action, and this delivers; the beach attack on the island full of Amazon women is a slow-motion blast of flying and fighting. But what really soars is the script, filled with dialogue that surprisingly pops (""We can't fix the war, but we can try to get to the men who can."" ""I AM the men who can!""). Elements of fish-out-of-water, believable romance and confident humor are more than consistent enough to the small moments of predictability, corn and bad visual effects. I can't help but imagine: what if this was our introduction to the Justice League universe? Instead of the faux-complexity of the Superman entries or the offensive simplicity of Suicide Squad, we'd be setting the tone for the franchise with a film about the effects of violence, the insanity of war and whether humans are inherently good or evil. Either way, it's so great to report that DC has more than righted their course and made a genre film for the ages.","45 out of 97 found this helpful.

The success of this show can be attributed largely to Gal Gadot . Without her , the picture probably would never have gained the popularity that it did. Dealing with Princess Diana (Gal gadot) who lives in Paradise Isle where women have extremely long lives keeping their looks and all without men . But World War I intruded on their island and the policy of isolation went up in smoke . As Diana must contend with a powerful enemy whose desire for extreme badness sends the world down a path of destruction . During World War I , while Amazonian warrior Diana in training along with her trainer Antiope (Robin Wright) , a plane piloted by officer Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes near Paradise Island , the secret hidden island home of the mighty and eternally young Amazons . The unfortunate pilot is rescued by Princess Diana, taking still unconscious Major to safety , he tells of conflict in the outside world , and learns of the war against the invader Germans . Meanwhile , some enemy military disrupting the fictitious all-female sanctuary of Themyscira created by the Gods of Olympus . The Amazons decide to send one of their own to help fight in this crisis . Although forbidden to participate in the selection process , Diana escapes secretly from her mother Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) and wins the right and responsibility to go . She leaves home to fight a war , discovering her full powers and true destiny . Taking the officer Steve , she joins him and subsequently teaming up with other valiant heroes (Sa√Ød Taghmaoui , Ewen Bremner , Eugene Brave Rock) . Heading to an early 20th Century London to stop the war she believes is influenced by the God Ares . Furthermore , the forces of evil threaten the nation, with the nasty General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) carrying out his misogynistic and chauvinistic policies as well as his chemist mad doctor (Elena Anaya) . Diana of the immortal Amazons aids for saving the world and that's why she wins the decisive power . More and more, cataclysmic events push the world to the brink , and emotionally vulnerable Diana must address a cruel dilemma. .A new era of wonder begins. Grace. Wisdom. Wonder. Power . Courage . The future of justice begins with her . Wonder Woman knew exactly which side she would take and it wasn't going to be . Can mighty Wonder Woman save humankind ?Thrilling heroine movie packed with frantic action , fights , moving scenes , dazzling production design and state-of-art special effects . This spectacular comic-book movie contains fantasy , noisy action , battles, romance , and is pretty entertaining. This is a dynamic , fast- paced and fun movie . It was made to appeal to wide range of audiences, so the plot wasn't so complex , but prominently featured super powers of Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot was absolutely believable as Wonder Woman, and there was no other actress of the time who could have played the role asides from her . This show had one really good thing going for it and that was a perfectly cast Gal Gadot in the title role as the immortal Amazon warrior , Princess Diana of Themyscira . Gal Gadot as Diana , Wonder Woman, would spin to transform into Wonder Wonder, armed with a invincible shield , magic belt giving her tremendous strength, bracelets that can stop any bullet, a tiara that can be thrown as a returning weapon and a unbreakable magic lasso that can force anyone to tell the truth . Nothing more fun to watch for a boy than to see her running here and there let me tell you. It also helps that it usually had a relatively good story line to go along with it . Including an interesting script and story from Allan Heinberg , Zack Snyder , Jason Fuchs , based on the characters created by William Moulton Marston .The motion picture was competently directed by Patty Jenkins.Followed by Wonder Woman 1984 (2020) in which Princess Diana finds herself trying to stay under the radar, working as an archaeologist at the Smithsonian Museum , directed by Patty Jenkins with Gal Gadot , Chris Pine , Kristen Wiig , Pedro Pascal , Robin Wright , Connie Nielsen . And previously ¬®Wonder Woman¬® (2011) by Jeffrey Reiner with Adrianne Palicki as Diana Princess / Wonder Woman , Cary Elwes , Pedro Pascal , Elizabeth Hurley . And the classic series Wonder Woman (1975) with Lynda Carter , Lyle Waggoner.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

(Really, Man-Dominated.? Women Rocks.. From the beginning of Mankind. Yeah) I just love Strong female characters. Skye, May from Agents of SHIELD, Supergirl, Amaya from Legends of Tomorrow, Sara, Laurel from Arrow, Miss Peggy Carter.. And If you've watched, then Devasena from Baahubali The Conclusion. She was the epitome of the Strong Women.It's sad that the world Hardly recognizes the focus, commitment & sheer will (you know what I did there ;) ) Women possess. Today also, women have to work 4 times Harder than men, just to get what they deserve. I just Hope, from this moment itself, it changes for the better. :)Now the movie, was so Gorgeous, I've difficulty finding words here. I was literally thinking, when the movie ended, what will I write in my review.? It was Magical experience, really.Gal Gadot was Out standing. Don't know why people hated her while she was being cast. Stupid. They needed more curvaceous woman than Gal, I think she was/is The Perfect choice for this role.If you just take the time out to look at her once, you'll feel All your problems, worries are Just Gone. She is Such a Beauty. Just Gorgeous. God (Zeus) Bless Her. I mean, after all, She's his daughter. ;)Chris Pine was Amazing. My God, he has Superb comic timing.Robin Wright was Just Awesome. Just seeing her in House of Cards & in This movie back to back, God.!! Both Strong characters.. Perfectly played.. Suck a Treat for Fans.David Thewlis, same as above. Seeing him in Fargo & in this movie, Man.!! He is a Fantastic actor.And I wouldn't be wrong if I tell you guys that this is the 1st DCEU movie done Exceptionally Well. If you weren't satisfied with Man of Steel, BvS: Dawn of Justice & Suicide Squad, Like Me, than Believe me, this movie will Fill All those Voids.Just watch it & Enjoy.Peace \/","11 out of 19 found this helpful.

Say what you want about the previous films, but I think we can all agree that they weren't as well received as they could have been. Now with ""Wonder Woman"" we have a good solid superhero story that's actually meaningful. Zack Snyder is not directing this time around, but his influence is still felt in the visual style of the explosive action scenes. Those parts are very entertaining, but they don't take center stage here. This film takes the time to introduce us to characters we can understand and care for. I think Patty Jenkins handled the emotional story nicely. I enjoyed the quite scenes as much as the exciting ones. It's about this one journey which makes it easy to follow. So it's not a very complicated film.The scenery on the Amazonian island is breathtaking. Perfect use of locations. The ancient Greek mythology elements work surprisingly well. The idea of setting the world outside the Amazonian realm during WWI is good. It makes the fish out of water situation with Diana even more interesting, and above all it really helped her development. So that made sense. I will say this though: If you are well educated in history and you happen to know a lot about WWI, then you are gonna be annoyed by some things here. Because it doesn't stay completely true to how everything was back then. Some liberties were taken here and there. I'm not an expert on war history, but my brother is and I had to listen to many things that were inaccurate on the way home after the screening. So, sure. They should have gotten some more history consultants to revise the production. As a normal movie goer you probably won't even think about those things. But if you are a history buff then take note that this is pure fantasy/escapism. You won't be too bothered about historical inaccuracies if you go in with that mindset. I do think the villains were very stereotypical. Most of the time it works, but I would have preferred them not being so much like cartoon bad guys. The final fight gets really bloated and CGI heavy with many explosions. It's handled much better then how it was in ""Batman v Superman"", and I'll tell you why: It was focused. The entire movie balances the human story with the action spectacle well. And that gets a good positive point from me.The main characters are likable here. There's not much I can add to what's already been said, but I strongly believe I'm seeing Wonder Woman on screen and not the actress Gal Gadot. She embodies this role with pride. Her chemistry with Chris Pine is great. There's some banter towards the end that gets repetitive, but other than that I liked it. The movie has a nice message as well. It's about working together and that love and compassion should never be forgotten. All of those things are nice. This movie has an upbeat vibe overall. It's kind of like a classic adventure movie and I like that. You will walk out feeling happy or maybe even a little inspired. That's a good sign that this will not be forgotten anytime soon. So, yes. I can now say that this a wonderful step forwards for DC. They have definitely improved a lot and I hope they continue like this.","20 out of 41 found this helpful.

You could very easily enjoy this film without seeing any of the previous films or will realize it as the best of it's franchise to date! Have no fear that this will be boring because of the period the film takes place in,it matters not. Creators of the film benefit greatly by staying true to the source material that has encapsulated audiences since Diana Prince's debut in comics over seven decades ago. As well as DC comic's own Geoff Johns joining the production team! Wonder Woman is done justice as she serves Justice by the amazing combat Sequences shot by Director Patty Jenkins and the score compliments the screen accordingly!I don't need humor in a film about a hero , nor do enjoy it when it's forced into a story. The humor in Wonder Woman is well placed and most called for and appreciated. The same goes for the action in this film it is not overdone nor is it to much or to little it is just right. . This movie benefits from an exciting story, heroic characters that are enjoyable and most credible vile villains. I want to see it again and can't wait to see Wonder Woman in Justice League this November!","160 out of 298 found this helpful.

Saying that it now currently holds my highest score of the year, however, would definitely qualify.The dramatic and comedic tones were perfectly balanced. Such a glaring omission from the previous DC offerings was any real feeling of levity. Here, jokes were well timed and delivered even better. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine's chemistry was automatic, making these back-and-forths all the more believable. And Lucy Davis steals the show as Pine's secretary.There is something to be said for the theme song of this movie. Do me a favor and try to hum the theme to the Avengers. How about Captain America? The most recent Spiderman, maybe? I might not be able to pick any of those out of a lineup. Wonder Woman's theme is visceral and will be immediately recognizable after you've heard it. It's featured in key moments of the film, adding to the weight of the already powerful action.Similar to most of the Marvel films, this one has a weak villain. A German officer is presented as the antagonist, but I felt more like it was just war in general that they were fighting against. I definitely liked the payoff, but he was underwhelming as an adversary.The only other negative I can think of is that there are some moments of wonky special effects. It took me back to The Matrix Reloaded where Neo is just a computer animated cartoon knocking around a dozen Agent Smiths with a stick. The effects seemed jarringly dated at times.DC was in an absolute tailspin up to this point. The last three films received critic ratings of 55%, 27%, and 25%. This could have been the nail in the coffin. Instead, it was an absolute B12 shot to the brand and the studio itself. Box office hauls of future DC films will no doubt be bigger because of this movie. And to think I almost stayed away from this one based on Batman v Superman alone. Now, Wonder Woman is the only reason I'll keep DC in my lineup going forward. 8.75/10.","146 out of 272 found this helpful.

"","","Gadot Makes the Film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3850198/?ref_=tt_urv","Michael_Elliott","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur13134536/?ref_=tt_urv","5 November 2017","Wonder Woman (2017) *** (out of 4) Amazonian warrior Diana (Gal Gadot) witnesses a plane crash into an ocean so she rushes to save the pilot (Chris Pine). Soon she realizes that there's some sort of war going on in the outside world and the two travel to London where Diana is going to get to reveal her full powers.It seems that next to Donald Trump, WONDER WOMAN was the most political discussion held by people on social media in 2017. I must admit that I skipped the movie in theaters and waited for its Blu-ray release and as an outsider I was just shocked at the countless political rants that were going on with the film. I don't plan on getting political in this review but I should also point out that I've never read a comic book in my life. With that said, WONDER WOMAN was certainly a good movie but I'm going to stop well short before calling it great or anything special.There were some wonderful things throughout the picture and we can start with Gadot. She was certainly the perfect choice for the role as she has the look down as well as the physical need for the role. I thought she perfectly owned every aspect of the role and she was certainly the best thing about the picture. I found Pine to be quite good as well and the two of them had a nice chemistry throughout. The Amazonian world was another good aspect as the look of it was wonderful and it really did come off as a fantasy world. The WWI setting was another plus.With that said, there really wasn't anything overly original here except for the lead being a woman. In fact, some of the things here I found to be quite lame including the non-stop sexual innuendo that starts right from the start to the very end of the picture. For all the ""she's a great role model for girls"" we certainly got a lot of lame jokes. I'd also argue that the CGI was used way too much. I know CGI is the king of the world in movies but for me when it's used poorly or too much it just takes away from everything on the screen and I thought that happened here.With that said, WONDER WOMAN is certainly a film that is worth watching but I'm just not going to celebrate it as some sort of great film.","10 out of 17 found this helpful.

But this very flawed pace allows the origin story of the amazonian warrior mature in a compelling build- up, and eventually navigate towards the rest of her story in a riveting seismic progression. It gathers an affectionate sentimentality that sustains its potency even amidst the imposing explosive sequences that often triumph to take the audience's attention away from the oddly satisfying distraction, that is Gal Gadot. There are these resonating anthems that remain ablaze throughout the film's 140-minute duration: love and peace, sacrifice and courage, and while it gets extremely preachy sometimes, the narrative rarely gets boring. Jenkins' take on the genre doesn't abandon the idea of terror, and mass destruction, but it singularly escapes the confines of superhero clich√©s that eliminate its players' moral form. In 'Wonder Woman', Diana Prince's humanity is held by Gadot's portrayal with a bracing commitment, something she never loses even when confronted with the deceptive appeal of evil and darkness. Her heroic verve gets an unexpected reinforcement from Chris Pine's Steve Trevor, with whom she shares a surprisingly inherent chemistry. This is the first DC film in a very long time, to ever sustain such visceral distinction, a visual extravaganza brimming with heart and reason.Diana Prince's story takes us to a mysterious island known as Themyscira, hidden by Zeus in a protective dome of dim and mist, far from the grasp of humanity. She grows to believe that it is her sacred duty to protect her world, not knowing such 'world' will include what is beyond the clouds. But when the first man arrives in a suspicious water- crash landing, she expands her understanding and begins to welcome the idea of defending whoever needs help in the other side. But this eagerness barely entirely rests on a moral responsibility; she believes that Ares, the God of War, and her inevitable nemesis, is what causing the war waged by humans, and she needs to kill him in order to restore peace to both worlds. In one spine-chilling moment within her breathtakingly choreographed fight sequence with Ares, Diana rises from a fall, and virtually carries out her meteoric ascent, a symbolic assumption of her superhero status.But in spite of the amount of physical tension and visual explosion, Jenkins balances the flavor by injecting humor and romance, utilizing them even in places where gripping action sequences are imminent. Chris Pine shines in his own moments, a remarkable feat for a character in a saga that seems to underscore women empowerment. There is a powerful moment where he grapples for words to ask for Diana's help to win the war; he practically breaks down, a stirring and moving scene to behold. Part of the film's colossal allure is its heart--it never loses it, doesn't intend to, and it grows to more awe-inspiring forms as it reaches a resonating, albeit predictable, resolution.It is ironic to think that Diana Prince isn't human, but appears to be the most one, when compared with her colleagues in the looming 'Justice League' film. In the end, 'Wonder Woman' isn't a film free of blemishes as it still stumbles upon political truths it rarely gets justified, and minor expositions it doesn't seem interested to shed light on. But it has soul, humor, and wonder-- a narrative spectacle one seldom finds in a film of its sort.","314 out of 612 found this helpful.

For a superhero movie, the special effects are very weak. For World War I movie, the realism of the historical setting is too inconsistent. (Probably explained by parallel history?) For an anti-war movie, the message is too flimsy. And passing from a gaudy setting on a beautiful (computer generated) Greek fantasy island to a gritty World War I setting is a bold move, no matter how well justified by the plot.For these reasons it is surprising that this genre-mixing movie actually works very well, overall.The film is the origin story of superhero 'Wonder Woman', though in this film she is only referred to as Diana, 'daughter' of the Queen of the Amazons, or 'Diana Prince'. Her 'mother' formed her out of clay to serve as an antagonist to Ares, the Greek god of war, but has become a bit protective. Diana is played by , who before becoming an actress was a Miss Israel and then a martial arts instructor in the Israeli military. This casting choice seems logical in many ways. It goes back to . (There are plenty of comments on this site claiming that she cannot act. I don't understand them.)In the first quarter of the film, Steve (Chris Pine), an English spy returning from Germany, crashes near the secret island of the Amazons and is rescued by Diana. Ultimately this leads to Diana leaving the island and seeking her destiny in a joint mission with Steve.After the warrior idyll of the first quarter, our two heroes travel to London, where the film temporarily turns into a comedy despite the gray setting. It is fun to watch an Amazon shop for clothes and get into conflict with early 20th century European gender stereotypes.In its second half the film becomes a war drama that has most of the action and superhero stuff, some of it in the trenches of the Ardennes. Unfortunately this is the weaker half, but it's still entertaining enough.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Exceptional. Outstanding. DC Hits a Homer! FINALLY.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3721777/?ref_=tt_urv","RLTerry1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22920280/?ref_=tt_urv","2 June 2017","WONDERful! No seriously, this is an excellent film! And I'm just not talking about the superhero genre. DC finally hit a homer with this one. This film also serves as evidence that Zack Snyder can WRITE a great story but should probably stay out of the director's chair. Warner Bros. and Ratpac Dune's¬†Wonder Woman is the superhero film we needed. Trailing so far behind the Marvel brand and film quality, DC needed to produce a film that would make up for¬†Batman v Superman and¬†Suicide Squad AND catch up to Marvel. Seemingly setting out to accomplish the impossible, this film exceeded all measurable expectations and provided a comprehensive cinematic experience. With many themes, this film hits on many topics and does so with incredible precision and elegance. It's almost as if this film is an extension of Diana Prince herself. Never addressed or referenced as Wonder Woman actually, Diana Prince's origin story is powerful and ever so apropos in today's socio-political climate. If only we could all have the courage, compassion, and determination that Wonder Woman embodies and represents. Ever since her creation in 1941 by psychologist William Marston, Wonder Woman has always been treated the best when all pre-existing inhibitions typically added to a female character in a ""man's"" role are removed, allowing the feminist ethos at her core to shine and erupt with unbridled passion and strength. Among other traits, the chief characteristic that separates her from other superheroes in both the Marvel and DC universes respectively is--no, not her gender--it is her ability to integrate truth, justice, compassion, and courage in everything she does to protect the planet entrusted to her people by the Greek gods. The key to understanding Wonder Woman is not through her brute strength or supernatural powers, but through her love and compassion for innocent people and her own integrity. Rarely has any film truly given women (or anyone, for the matter) a strong female protagonist who does not pander but exhibits excellence in well-developed strength of character and a complete eruption of the fantasies of many women to rise up to serve and protect. It would have been far too easy to sell Diana Prince as a vengeful women out to destroy men or seek revenge for the destruction that has befallen the planet; but no, that is not the Diana we see. We see a heroine of others--a completely unselfish hero who is of earth. Being of the earth is truly what separates her from someone like Super Man. Sure, some strong female characters from with the world of comics, literature, theatre, TV, or film have demonstrated strong characteristics and have been leaders; but¬†Wonder Woman sands alone as a film that provides audiences with a female protagonist who is not merely a leader, but the engineer--the author--of her own destiny and story.Why does this film work so well??? After all, that is the question you are likely asking yourself after so many DC flops (note: that does not count the Burton or Nolan films). The short answer is that Snyder was NOT in the driver's seat on this ride; however, there is more to it than that. Snyder's touch is certainly evident in many scenes (especially the action sequences); furthermore, he was greatly instrumental in the overall structure, but he took a backseat to the driver of this vehicle. His approach was important in the design of the car, and even building it, but when it came time to take it for a spin, he turned the steering wheel over to Director Patty Jenkins. Films featuring strong female protagonists most often seem to fair better when there is a women at the helm. And¬†Wonder Woman is a testament to that observation. Whereas a male director would have likely spent some time sexualizing Diana, Jenkins spends the time on her courage and compassion. Instead of focusing on the terrain of Diana's mystical home beautifully appointed with white cliffs and sapphire water or spending time on her sleek blade or even her trademark lasso of truth, Jenkins spends a significant amount of screen time on the terrain of Diana's face. A face that communicates the heart, mind, and soul of Diana. Instead of a face displaying anger or disgust at the world of men, her face is often bright, hopeful, containing a winning smile with eyes overflowing with optimism. In terms of the production design itself, it only bares hints of Snyder's penchant for beautiful music videos; the production design is one that takes itself seriously, but in the perfect amounts. Although the film is quite dark, there are sufficient moments of levity.Perhaps you're a stereotypical dude who does not care for films that feature female protagonists and feministic themes. No fear.¬†Wonder Woman is actually a World War I film disguised as a superhero movie. As much as¬†Wonder Woman works as an exceptional superhero movie, it is equally an impressive World War I film. Taking place in the days leading up to Armistice Day, this film displays the atrocities of war and the determination of both sides to win. You will find yourself in the trenches in France and Belgium with the Allied forces who, against all odds, are determined to defeat the enemy in order to stop genocide and widespread devastation. Placing Wonder Woman amidst the warriors of earth, connects her to humanity in ways that most superheroes cannot. Fighting for what you believe in is a major theme in this film. Some of the best war movies are those that ""show don't tell."" And¬†Wonder Woman certainly shows what war really looks like instead of talking about it as some abstract concept or spending time in diplomacy. In fact, diplomacy is thrown out the window, and Diana lays the need to fight on the hearts of the bureaucratic leaders and soldiers alike. Pick up your sword and fight. Don't just sit idly by while humanity is destroyed.","115 out of 214 found this helpful.

Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) forbids her training but Antiope (Robin Wright) disobeys her. Zeus had created mankind which were corrupted by Ares, God of War. Zeus defeated him and hid Themyscira from the world. One day, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes his plane and is rescued by Diana. It's WWI and Trevor is an American spy working for the British. He had discovered that German General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) is developing a devastating new poison gas. Diana fears that Ares has returned to wreck havoc and journeys to kill a God. They travel to London where Sir Patrick (David Thewlis) is leading the peace effort.The DCEU was having problems. I wouldn't say that it is in any danger but it needed an unreserved win. This is exactly that. I was leery of the choice of Gal Gadot when it was first announced. Her English was barely understandable at the time and her acting was stiff. Her English has improved by leaps and bounds and her acting is also better. The genius of Patty Jenkins is to steer into her deficiencies. Patty fully embraces her sincerity and makes all the Amazonians have the same accent as her. It's a brilliant move.The other Patty brilliance is her emotional IQ. She understands human emotions better than anything in BvS. The best comparison is Martha and the double reveal of Steve's final conversation with Diana. Martha is a silly construction. The double scene is emotional heartbreak. The action is solid. The no-man's land fight is amazing. There is humor but not just the quippy Marvel humor. It is character-based and well-earned. It hits almost every note perfectly.","27 out of 45 found this helpful.

Hollywood is full of beautiful actresses, but Gal also has a great personality which resonates with her character very well. She is strong as well as funny. Chris Pine turned out to be the perfect sidekick and love interest of Diana. He has this old classic Hollywood look. I am hoping we will see more of Connie Nelson and Robin Wright's character in the next venture. I don't want to go further into screenplay. It has its tiny flaws, but we have seen much worse in recent times. Many people might argue why the WWI? Well, the core of the movie is not the war, but the darkness inside us that causes the war. You can easily relate it to today's narrative. I enjoyed the movie through and through. Finally a quality superhero movie from DC after Batman Trilogy.

This movie is comparable to Captain America: The First Avenger, but most of the people is no longer interested in movies about the origins of superheros because... well, we all know them.The acting is below the average, and the CGI is, despite its quality, too unrealistic. OK, we're talking about the daughter of the King of the Gods, but the way the movie manages her obvious overpower above her peers is so bland it makes you laugh rather than enjoying the film. The story isn't even good, all situations coming out from nowhere just to fake some kind of continuity along the flick.I can't understand some of the extremely positive reviews of this film, but I guess it has something to do with the new Hollywood trend to make films about women empowerment, and it's getting good reviews because it's the first blockbuster to show a woman as a non-mystical super-heroine in the main character since Lara Croft. Maybe they should ask the creators of the last Mad Max movie for some advice about making a movie which truly represents the real postulates of the feminist movement, instead of filming ridiculous action films with zero undertones just for the sake of the box office based on DC hardcore fans and out-of-criteria feminists.","18 out of 38 found this helpful.

"6","/10","This movie is okay; this woman is amazing.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3757576/?ref_=tt_urv","WondrousMoose","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur36671058/?ref_=tt_urv","18 July 2017","Wonder Woman is the fourth movie in the DC Extended Universe and its second film following a single hero. Given the quality of the movies that preceded it and Wonder Woman's anemic presence in last year's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, I really didn't have high hopes for this one. I figured I'd give it a shot, though, and to my surprise, it wasn't awful; in fact, I mostly enjoyed it.Diana (Gal Gadot) is an Amazon from the island of Themyscira, a land occupied and governed entirely by women. When American fighter pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash-lands off their coast, Diana rescues him and leaves her home to try to put an end to the First World War, which she believes to be the work of Ares, the god of war. Matters aren't as simple as she planned, though, and she ends up learning uncomfortable truths about humanity, as well as secrets of her own identity.For the most part, Wonder Woman is a relief from the dour, clunky DC films that have preceded it. First off ‚Äì this one is in color! Gone are the days of gray-and-orange sludge; this movie has green grass and a blue sky. More importantly, Wonder Woman's costume has taken on some classic red and blue. The requisite sexist and fish-out-of- water scenes are mostly given their appropriate time on screen without becoming tedious, and a good deal of the intended humor actually lands. There's an improvised scene early on featuring the two leads on a boat at sea, and they play off of each other wonderfully.Unfortunately, the film still suffers from a lot of the issues that the previous DC films have: awkward pacing, on-the-nose dialog, weak villains, and an overwhelming score that beats you over the head with what you're supposed to feel at every step of the way. The movie is also incredibly cheesy, and while there is an appropriate, or even desired amount of cheese in a comic book movie, I found myself groaning a bit too much from it all. The battle scenes also manage to out- Snyder Zack Snyder in terms of their overuse of slow motion and ""awesome"", impractical fighting. When Wonder Woman herself isn't involved in scenes, I tend to lose interest, and the reveal toward the end of the film hit me like a handful of Triscuits.Far and away the best aspect of the movie is Wonder Woman herself. Gal Gadot's performance as a naive hero with an overpowering sense of duty is impeccable, and I loved watching her work. This character saves people because she wants to save them, and it is truly compelling to watch such a pure expression of a superhero. We have seen enough movies about heroes begrudgingly doing their work; in BvS, Superman looks pained to help, and Batman doesn't even try to save anyone.Wonder Woman in this film just might be my favorite superhero in the current cinematic universes, across both Marvel's and DC's movies. We see a hero who fights for those who can't fight for themselves. Marvel has produced quippy dialog and some fun fight scenes, but its heroism has faltered lately. For their deity superhero, they gave us a pile of cardboard with a hammer and a sexy accent. I haven't been this excited for comic book movies since the first Avengers film, and I really wasn't expecting that from DC at this point.I recommend this movie, not for its intrinsic qualities as a film but for the direction it is potentially taking the DCEU and for its main character. I still don't have high hopes for Justice League, but if they keep this hero doing what she does best, I'll probably be just fine with it.","12 out of 24 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Above all else, Wonder Woman is charming, funny and exciting","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3800487/?ref_=tt_urv","tomgillespie2002","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3741220/?ref_=tt_urv","8 September 2017","It's incredibly sad to read about how many milestones Wonder Woman touches on, especially in this day and age where a high-profile Twitter user must consider every message they post to the world in fear of being racist, sexist, homophobic, or just plain insensitive. Despite the influx of superhero movies since Marvel kicked off their Cinematic Universe in 2008 with Iron Man, and despite the abundance of long-standing and hugely popular female superheroes existing in the comics, and despite audiences calling out for a female-led superhero film ever since Scarlett Johansson donned the leathers as Black Widow in Iron Man 2, studios have failed to deliver one in 12 years. Perhaps the studios were scared they would have another Elektra on their hands, but that movie failed because it was terrible, and was a spin-off from the also-terrible Daredevil.The DC Extended Universe, in the face of the critical mauling they received last year with the double-whammy of Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, can only be applauded for taking the much-overdue 'risk' of launching a female-led franchise with Wonder Woman, a movie that not only represents so much in terms of moving cinema out of a stone-age mentality and into the modern world, but surpasses all expectations in a time of superhero overkill. Wonder Woman is, above all, charming, funny and exciting, and will hopefully help steer the DCEU back on track after an incredibly wobbly start. Making her introduction in Batman v Superman and emerging as one of the few positive things to be said about Zack Snyder's overblown and poorly-constructed smack- down, Wonder Woman begins in the present day but flashes back to the time glimpsed in the black-and-white photograph sent to her by Ben Affleck's Batman, when World War I was in full flow and her heart was won by a spy named Steve.The young Diana grows up on the island of Themyscira, a beautiful hidden paradise created by Zeus to be a home for the Amazons, a tribe of fierce female warriors tasked with protecting the world from the Greek God's evil, warmongering brother Ares. Diana's mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), attempts to shield her from the horrors of war and forbids her to practice combat, while her auntie Anitope (Robin Wright) realises her potential and trains her in secret. Zeus left the islanders a gift, a weapon called the 'Godkiller', which will prove decisive when the battle with Ares finally stirs. Cue the arrival of Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), an Allied spy who stumbles on the island while fleeing the Germans. He brings death and war with him, and the Amazons want to kill him before Diana intervenes, revealing he saved her life. The tribe want nothing to do with a war waged by man, but Diana suspects Ares may be puppet-master behind the conflict that has taken millions of lives. Against her mother's wishes, she travels with Steve to London, where he reveals to his superiors German plans to release a devastating new mustard gas created by General Ludendroff (Danny Huston) and Spanish chemist Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya).The word 'man' carries a special significance, and director Patty Jenkins carefully weaves this idea into the film without rubbing it in your face. As well as the violent, dangerous 'world of men' lurking across the waters, there is also No Man's Land, the stretch of mud and rubble separating the two warring fronts. This is a place that no man can hope to survive, and this sets up the triumphant moment seen in the trailers in which Diana deflects machine-gun fire with her bracelets and shield before taking out anybody daft enough to stand in her way. This scene is made all the more powerful by Gal Gadot, who puts in a terrific performance despite her lack of acting experience and puts all the doubters to rest, proving to be just as savvy with comedy as the action. The fact that we care so much about her also means that the CGI-heavy climax, which seems to be trend with DC, can almost be forgiven. Thanks to well-written character development and some charming chemistry between Gadot and the ever- brilliant Chris Pine, there is a real emotional investment that was lacking in DC's previous misfires. In terms of origin stories, this doesn't rewrite the rule-book, but the importance and significance of Wonder Woman should not be underestimated.","6 out of 10 found this helpful.

However, if I were to have lent ear to all the reviews and commentaries, I would have been quite annoyed. This is NOT a good movie. I barely rate it average.There were good parts in it, mainly the feminist aspects of the film. Diana is tough, but also a woman, with a strong personal and cultural desire to help, mend, love. Of course, it is taken to ridiculous heights and made completely worthless in the end, when she kills a bunch of people, but still, it was a refreshing, if badly implemented, point of view.Other than that there is a lot of bad characterization, starting with the Amazons and Ares and ending with the three ""sidekicks"" that do almost nothing the entire movie. Even the villains are underused, in a movie that somehow managed to total over two hours. There are some scenes that should make the director cower in shame (see the ""they don't know that"" scene, ugh!) and some bad acting here and there.Gal Gadot is beautiful, but not an extremely talented actress. She did her best, though. Chris Pine played Captain Kirk, complete with motorcycle and the scene where he stops, thinks a little, then rides another way, plus the obligatory self sacrifice scene. I think it was some sort of tribute, but that part wasn't good in Star Trek either.Bottom line: you can watch it just like you would a Batman or Superman movie and expect just as much. ""The savior of DC franchises"" is no worse or better than the things people called disasters before. It is not fun, merely time consuming.","5 out of 8 found this helpful.

Her smile, her grace and her world are all stunning. Their chemistry is strong). He tells the ethnically diverse group about World War I. Might Ares have returned, creating the conflict he lives for?There are chunks of this that pass without action. Especially in the middle section. The climax is less chaotic, loud and, well, blinding, than Batman V Superman's, albeit not entirely dodging those problems. And the first few aren't as consequential. The initial one is essentially combat training. However, when it's there, it is always good, and frequently amazing. It's not there purely because that's part of why we came to watch. Never does it just make people look cool, and let the heroine stack up a body-count. Heck, she barely kills anyone, and she clearly isn't interested in it. In one of the (too) many similarities to Captain America: The First Avenger(a movie it does largely match in overall quality. Nevertheless, it feels derivative), she ""doesn't like bullies"". No, first and foremost, she's doing it to save people.This as the leaders of the countries involved are shrugging off massive casualties. As No Man's Land is treated as an unfortunate reality, not one that is likely to be brought to an end. While the two villains, who could easily have been combined into one, spend their compelling screen-time either using horrible poison gas on the defenseless, or studying hard to make it even worse. She's there to rescue those she's never met. From a race she hadn't even encountered days earlier, in her whole life. We're in the middle of a comic book movie boom. And yet this seemingly obvious value and goal so often goes forgotten these days.Other than the leads, a lot of the performers, talented as most of them are, get lost in the shuffle, with only a couple of moments to really shine. The Amazons are almost all bad actors ‚Äì I figure they went for physical types, instead. I would say it could have been handled by hiring talents specifically for when they have dialog, and then those would be ones we didn't see in other scenes. Mostly, they are there to convince you of Paradise Island as somewhere people live, work, not only fence. And they succeed. There are pacing issues. The ending is bad, and borrows from great, but mismatched, sources. Occasionally, the message and themes get cheesy, and the final resolution is one example. Although the humor is rapid-fire, using the fish-out-of-water element well, it frequently feels forced, and I don't blame those who find it obnoxious and, indeed, at no point actually funny. The DCEU(no, saying that this is the best of the four isn't saying much) has yet to balance jokes with seriousness. It's not a perfect film. What it is, is genuinely engaging and moving. Warner Brothers? Keep Patty Jenkins around. She'll help you properly compete with the MCU.There is a lot of disturbing content in this. I recommend it to everyone. 7/10","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

They have great chemistry and their relationship adds human interest.Unlike ""Man of Steel,"" which devolved into super-beings constantly pulverizing each other in the second half, ""Wonder Woman"" has the poise to take its time and establish an interesting assortment of characters. The entire midsection is great, but the last act, to be expected, comes down to two super-beings pounding each other. But at least the creators tried to add a weighty moral.The film runs 2 hours, 21 minutes.GRADE: B","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Okay, we are all entitled to an opinion. If you go to see a movie that you know features a female superhero, probably seen stills and maybe a trailer, it shouldn't be a surprise to see ridiculous antics, a light plot, and a fun film aimed mainly at the male teenage market. Someone had a go at the acting, nothing wrong with it that I could see.

But this had some appeal to me. There is some sort of a story. There are characters and there is some OK acting. The action slowly builds up from some initial Amazon training scenes to later total god mode out of this world in the air hovering boss fight. 
If you want a movie to be successful these days you have to do this stuff. Either do it or be removed from the theaters after one week. After all: it is entertainment business.

After three films that left most people disappointed or upset ""Wonder Woman"" had a very difficult job to do. It had to please the fans, make people believe in the DCEU again and of course be a good movie. I personally really like ""Man of Steel"" and the director's cut of ""Batman V Superman"" (i am not going to talk about suicide squad) so i was very excited about watching ""Wonder Woman"" and i Think it delivered. It was entertaining at all times, it had exciting action set-pieces but it still took it's time to have some more quite character moments between Chris Pine and Gal Gadot. This is what makes this movie special. It told a great origin story with some themes that were very fitting to the rest of the film. I still have a few issues with the film like the Way some of the characters were treated and the use of CGI explosions but that's about it.

"7","/10","Exceeding Expectations, but not Perfect","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3726993/?ref_=tt_urv","please_stand_by","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57731605/?ref_=tt_urv","9 June 2017","With the last DC film to come out being Suicide Squad, there was good reason to be concerned about Wonder Woman. Even after the initial wave of positive reviews for it started coming in I was extremely skeptical. With DC having been in a slump of critically unpopular movies and with superhero movie fatigue on the rise, I really thought there was almost no possible way this would be good or be received well. For the most part, I was wrong. That being said, it is by no means perfect. The fact that this movie is being lauded by many critics as some kind of masterpiece is strange. I was reasonably satisfied overall, but let's not get carried away.First, the good news: The overall premise of Wonder Woman helping to bring about an end to WWI by finding and battling the god of war Ares, is a perfectly straightforward and compelling superhero plot. The characters mostly work well, even if some of the side characters that accompany her later on feel a bit pointless and underused. Tonally this is also substantially lighter fare than the other recent DC films, which are all pretty heavy and dark and grim.Initially, I doubted Gal Gadot could pull off carrying an entire movie, but once again, I was (mostly) wrong. She embodies the role to the point where she is probably the best part of the movie and carries it with surprising competence. Part of my skepticism came from the fact that she is/was a model whose previous forays into the world of acting have more or less been as eye candy in the mind-numbing Fast and Furious franchise.Thankfully, her model looks are not used as a cheap device to hijack the movie into the realm of fan service. That said, her looks do help her to believably pull off a character that is essentially a goddess. Her character is also very clearly a warrior, yet she still mostly plays the character as feminine, not as a male proxy. She also plays the character with an innocent earnestness that, along with her looks, help her to stand out like a beacon in the drab, dreary, and miserable setting of WWI era Europe. And even though she may not have the acting chops of a top tier actress (and it shows in a few scenes), her being cast here fits well enough that I would have a hard time seeing anyone else in the role now. Strong casting usually trumps raw acting experience.Some of the scenes she is in with Chris Pine's character, who she has an appropriately awkward chemistry with, were allowed to be improvised, which sometimes leads to some very clunky interactions. It kind of works with the naivet√© of the character, but perhaps a more clever scripted sequence could accomplish the same thing better. I also wasn't a fan of the early sequences of the movie where Diana is growing up and receiving lots of exposition about her homeland and history. It's a beautiful setting and it sets up the rationale for her leaving, but it drags on and the other characters there are mostly uninteresting. Once she leaves, the plot picks up, with a few rocky patches here and there.The usage of slow motion during action sequences all the way until the ending is excessive, but not to the point where it's overly obnoxious. My thoughts on the ending and the accompanying battle are mixed. It works as a flashy and climactic way to resolve her motivations for entering the war, but it almost becomes a completely different movie at that point. I think this could've been executed differently so it didn't feel as out of place.One other problem which personally bothers me the most is the body count. Superman, Batman, and now even Wonder Woman all kill tons of people (Marvel is occasionally guilty of this as well). With Wonder Woman it feels especially wrong, since not only is she against the idea of war to begin with, but the German soldiers she is so easily crushing with her incredible strength are to her merely innocent men being manipulated by Ares. Yes, this is a war, but at no point is subdual or allowing surrender even considered after demonstrating her immense power. I understand that an action movie needs action, but action doesn't need to mean killing everybody. The early fight on the beaches of her homeland is also strange, with both sides just immediately deciding to kill the other despite having no idea who they even are. If you were a WWI era German soldier who accidentally sailed up to an unknown island and saw a bunch of women riding horses on the beach wearing ancient Greek looking armor, would you immediately open fire on them? It just doesn't make much sense.All in all, it's a good movie made better by the fact that it exceeded expectations, but I wouldn't overdo it with the praise. Let's hope DC movies can stay at this level or improve, and maybe Gal Gadot can counterbalance that dark pessimism in the DCEU with some refreshing hopeful optimism.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

Then one day she sees an airplane in the skies which crashes in the ocean near the island and she rushes out to save the occupant. It's then that she discovers that this person is a man-and she has never seen one before as her entire island is populated by females. But before she can get much information from him the island is attacked by German soldiers who are eventually killed in a very fierce battle. Not long afterward she is told that his name is ""Captain Steve Trevor"" (Chris Pine) and he is an American soldier working with British Intelligence. Not only that, but he also tells her that the entire world is involved in a war on the scale of something that has never happened before. So having already witnessed the ruthlessness of the Germans, she decides to go with Captain Trevor to London to track down and kill the individual responsible-Aires, the God of War. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a pretty good ""Comic Book movie"" which had plenty of action and an interesting plot. Likewise, the presence of an attractive actress like Gal Gadot certainly didn't hurt matters either. Be that as it may, I enjoyed this film and have rated it accordingly.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

The thematic relevance and consistency is good, the visuals and color grade are refreshing, the acting is pretty great, and the writing has a lot of good moments and the story is compelling at base. Even the action stands above the standard superhero movie in memorability and fun. The prop and costume design is absolutely terrific.Unfortunately, all of this is marred terribly by the editing. The entire film is incredibly slow paced for an action movie, even several fight scenes feel lethargic. There are several scenes present that add nothing to the movie, and several jarring oddities. The editing needed serious tightening, and this issue multiplies existing issues. Some of the dialogue is tedious and unnecessary, and the slow editing compounds this into making the movie feel as boring as the dialogue at these parts. The 2 hour and 20 minute runtime is far too long for the substance of the film. There is little outside the editing that's negative, with some odd special effects or minor continuity inconsistencies.I praise this movie generally, but I can't recommend it for casual viewers.

This movie is incredible, outstanding, excellent, fabulous, amazing etc. Gal Gadot portrayed wonder woman so well. I was amazed by Gal Gadot's acting. Gadot's accent is the same as she did in the movie so it seems like she was born to play this role. This movie has a deep meaning. The script is really good. Action is done very well. The shooting is also fab. The ending twist is perfect. I was always a fan of wonder woman but now I am even more. I heard Gadot got a neck and back surgery after completing the movie. Great for children above 8 and also great for adults. The plot is mind blowing. I have watched this without exaggerating 6 times. I was in awe after watching it.

"9","/10","The Amazon Princess Finally Makes It To The Big Screen","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8575797/?ref_=tt_urv","virek213","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1249454/?ref_=tt_urv","29 September 2022","I have to confess, I am not a fan of big-screen comic book/superhero films, especially of the last twenty-plus years. In fact, the only one of these I sat through in my life was the original SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE, arguably the best film of its kind ever made-and this was back in 1978. But while I probably can't change my mind about the genre after seeing it, the 2017 film WONDER WOMAN has more than enough to distinguish it from the others of either the DC Comics lineup (which it is a part of) or Marvel.The character of Diana, the Amazon warrior princess who became Wonder Woman, originated in comic books the late 1930's, but the most famous iteration of this character was on television during the late 1970's, when the role was portrayed (and legendarily so) by Lynda Carter. Fortunately, in the midst of Hollywood's (and the film going public's) obsession with comics, the character finally made a stand-alone big-screen bow in 2017-and with no less than a woman in the director's chair, Patty Jenkins, here making her first film as a director since 2003's MONSTER.Israeli actress Gal Gadot steps into the role of the Amazon warrior princess, whose background of growing up among fellow goddesses on the mythical island of Themyscira is brilliantly depicted by Jenkins and her crew on location in Italy, and is mentored by the best of them (portrayed by Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright). But everything changes for her when an American pilot (Chris Pine) working as a spy for the British crashes his plane close to the island. Pine tells of a war to end all wars happening in the world outside of Themyscira, which is shielded by an invisible force field; and Gadot, having realized her abilities, makes every effort to try and stop it all. She and Pine take a boat into the worst of the fighting on the Western Front in France near the end of this war, World War I, and try to stop a ruthless German general (Danny Huston) from manufacturing a lethal gas sure to make an already atrocious body count in this first example of genuine mechanized warfare even higher than it is. The adventures that Gadot and Pine go on force Gadot to not only understand her own powers, but the weaknesses of the human race in general, and men in particular, and the penchant they have for killing each other through hatred. In her relationship with Pine, she realizes that love is the one thing that can save the world.Unlike so many other superhero comic book movies, Wonder Woman, besides having immense powers of her own, is also able to show empathy and understanding, only using her powers when nothing else will do. And even though her Israeli accent is very obvious in her line renderings, Gadot makes a completely credible Wonder Woman all the same-likely, she was the only actress capable of creating a Wonder Woman for this era (even though this film is set more than a century in the past) and still paving a certain amount of homage to Carter, whom Jenkins gives very special thanks to in the final credits. The visual effects and the costumes are all first-rate, of course; but the reason they, and the film in general, work as well as they do is because of Jenkins' fine direction and Gadot's portrayal. This is not just a slam-bang, hypersonic Hollywood spectacle. This is a spectacle with a heart and a conscience; and that's why it gets a '9' rating from me.","3 out of 3 found this helpful.

Despite it's over two hours duration someone can watch it with pleasure. I found many common things to the Captain America's movie as well as to the God of War action game with a female character instead. The movie introduce us to the world of the Amazons. A female warrior society where young Diana grows up. The photography of beautiful landscapes and world war industrial cities is tied to the movie's atmosphere. Costumes and vehicles too. Dialogs are pretty simply but they are not redundant most of the time. Gal Gadot's and Chris Pine's chemistry is good. She is a strong female personality but at the same time she possesses a lot of compassion for the human suffering caused by the war and therefore they have a common ground. Acting performances are not great but they are not bad either. Everyone has it's own separate role and they are all tied up together. Choreographies are impressive with tension and quite natural moves for CGI. The soundtrack and the sound effects are suitable to the movie's theme. It is an amusing superhero movie in general which introduces us the wonder woman, a member of the upcoming DC's justice league movie.","14 out of 32 found this helpful.

Wonder Woman has been my favourite character since I was seven years old. Thank you Patty Jenkins & THANK YOU Gal Gadot for this masterpiece! üíôThe film begins inside the walls of the Louvre Museum in Paris. The story begins with Diana, Princess of Themyscira looking at a picture from her past & we are taken on a journey on how she became Wonder Woman by participating in World War I alongside Steve Trevor & his gang plus defeating Ares, the God of War.Wonder Woman is simply amazing. The film does not hold back because Gal Gadot - bless her - gives you all the glory of the iconic Amazonian Warrior Princess. Gal Gadot was well known from the Fast & Furious series, but her quintessential performance in this film has cemented herself as an icon! As Princess Diana of Themyscira, Gal truly does kick ass in this film. She truly is a superwoman in reality as she did her own stunts despite being five months pregnant!This film is a masterpiece courtesy of the hard work put into the cinematography to the brilliant choreography & the production plus art design as well as the meticulous details into the costumes. It's one of the many reasons why I keep on watching this film because it truly feels like you are in their world.The message of love is strong in this film & I believe in love just like Wonder Woman.PS: I managed to muster the courage to go to the State of Israel & experience the beauty the nation has to offer.

Don't be like me, you shouldn't see this awful movie and certainly it's not good to support such trash. The more money the DCEU generates the more we'll see the same mistakes over and over and over again.Despite the fake early reviews, it is safe to say that Wonder Woman is another miss from Warner Brothers. The movie feels overcrowded and bloated yet shallow as a mud puddle. Comics have the beauty of telling a story over months of issues where corrections can be made even when the ball is rolling. Films do not afford that opportunity. If you make a mistake ‚Äî like casting a beauty queen that can't act ‚Äî then you're stuck with it. You can't ""change artists.""Word on the street is that Warner Brothers ordered the DCEU to incorporate humor and less morbid story lines. Well, the film that was turned in did feel like a piecemeal script. Apparently, you can't even hold out hope for a directors cut this time around.This script must have been written by the people who write the responses ball players give at a press conference. Seriously, did the writers make a drinking game out of how many awful one-liners they could jam into the movie? It's like they opened fortune cookie after fortune cookie looking for the next cheesiest line. Did the director have any input on writing any of this mess? At the end of the day, there is only one cure for the affliction the WB keeps perpetrating and the bad films that we find ourselves plagued with right now ‚Äî STOP! Just stop going to these movies! The studios will never stop churning out this mindless drivel that sucks all hope out of seeing a good superhero movie again until we stop throwing our money at them.Trust me, the dumpster fires that were Suicide Squad and BvS may be worse but in and of itself Wonder Woman just isn't worth your time or money.","39 out of 104 found this helpful.

This movie is a hot mess. I went in with high expectations after reading all the reviews praising this movie. At the end of the first act (you'll know which one I'm talking about when you see the movie), it felt that the movie should have stopped right there and probably leave Ares to a sequel or something. But no, it slowed down and then moved on to the next villain. And when you think it's over, another villain slapped you in the face and made me think, ""oh yeah, there's another one that they haven't addressed yet"". In total, this movie has 3 climaxes, all arguably equal in terms of power and and at the end of the movie, it is similar to the feeling of stepping off a nauseating roller coaster ride with dramatically steep ups and downs in terms of the pacing of the movie. I would also like to point out that I am not a comic book reader but an avid moviegoer and therefore, no... I am not a Marvel fanboy which many people would say biased my opinion. I want to go to a movie to feel entertained and sorry to say, this movie did not entertain me.","12 out of 27 found this helpful.

"6","/10","An over-hyped movie, much too predictable","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3731142/?ref_=tt_urv","antoniokowatsch","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur67115437/?ref_=tt_urv","15 June 2017","I really don't understand all the hype that surrounds this particular movie. I had pretty high expectations for it and was quite disappointed when I actually got to see it. The only good thing that the movie had going for it was the film score and the cinematography. But if you look at the story line the movie is extremely one-dimensional. There is no real plot and almost no character development, literally. So, there's not much substance to all these high praises that this movie managed to accumulate. It seems. But just to be perfectly clear about it; this movie felt like feminist propaganda. And when I'm saying feminist I'm not referring to the textbook definition of feminism but rather the now established cult of man-hating individuals. As an egalitarian I can totally get behind the ""third wave of feminism"", which has very little in common with today's feminism. But I digress. The reason why I believe this to be the aforementioned type of propaganda is pretty simple to deduce; the protagonist is female, morally superior and virtually invincible (at no point during the movie was the life of the protagonist in any real danger*). Meanwhile all the men are portrayed as ""horny"", dumb, ""needlessly"" violent, expendable, and anything but virtuous. With the sole exception of the other protagonist (aka the ""crashed pilot"") who I'd dare to call a ""token man"" because of what fate awaits him during the end segment of the movie. I don't know about you but I call this very bad story telling. Ideally one should try to make every character just a little bit flawed (even the protagonist), otherwise the whole story just feels like literal propaganda. The writers intent clearly bleeds into the script in this particular case. One would have to be blind to not see that.*just to elaborate on the point that I made earlier: the protagonist was never in any situation that one could describe as ""dangerous"". She was clearly overpowered, and just to take the point home; the movie literally starts out with a scene from the end segment of another movie ""Batman Vs Superman"", which literally tells us that no matter what happens in this movie, at the end she'll make it out alive with a memento of a war (the photo). So that scene right there pretty much summarizes half of the movie, no pun intended. To conclude: I feel really saddened. Not by the fact that the movie was rather mediocre but by the fact that most people don't even realize it. That's the real tragedy.","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Review From a Non-Comic Book Fan: Surprisingly Good","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7428794/?ref_=tt_urv","RayCharles81","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur14262019/?ref_=tt_urv","10 October 2021","I don't watch any comic book movies. The only reason I watched this is because WW 1984 was hyped during the Coronavirus lockdowns so I watched that out of interest. Reading reviews about that, I wanted to see what the 2017 version was like in comparison. So let me make clear, if you are already a comic book movie fan, this review is coming from a POV of somebody who never watches any of them except for Nolan's Batman trilogy and older ones from the 80's mostly, maybe 1 or 2 from the early 2000's like Spiderman and Superman Returns, both were pretty good.As a big fan of World War I (and WW II), I actually loved this movie's ability to converge the story of Dianna into that backdrop, and in my opinion, this is more of a WWI movie than it is a ""superhero"" or comic book movie, even though obviously it is also that, too. The reason why is because the way the scenes were staged and set up, it immersed you into that time period. Most of the costumes, background scenery, war scenes, and even the strategies, weapons, and geography discussed throughout the movie were surprisingly extremely accurate for that, and I was not expecting that whatsoever. In fact, my expectations were incredibly low for this movie before watching it.Second, let me mention the also unexpected delight of the added mix of legit funny scenes/humor and a love story that was almost as poignant as something at the pinnacle of that genre, Titanic. Once again, this was totally unexpected on both levels, and I was pleasantly surprised at how well they were included. It made the film even more likable and entertaining.Thirdly, the script is very good. It's not elite, but it is way above average and good for this genre. That was also unexpected.I also have to mention the acting, and Pine does a very good job in his role. Gadot's exotic looks and accent work extremely well for her role since one of the main ideas of the story is that she is a fish out of water entering the modern world from her secluded island.About the only thing I didn't like about this film was how the action sequences toward the end became a little too far fetched and cheesy, but even so, the scenes were emotionally powerful between the score, dialogue, themes, and acting so those components redeemed it just enough to save it from being really bad. It sort of devolved into an average villain cliche, and there is no denying that. However, there were some emotionally powerful elements going on while that was happening. I almost feel like I want to forget that bad part and remember the good parts of that final battle scene.Finally, I do not usually cry during movies, but this movie caused me to shed a few tears on two levels. First, it's an absolutely beautiful movie between the scenery, musical score, and cinematography. It's brilliant. Second, Gadot's reactions to the sufferings of war and her chemistry with Pine in the love story side of it and their disagreements about the causes of war she hates were very emotionally powerful, and I also did not anticipate that either. The movie has depth, it has emotional depth, and it is hard to forget because this is what makes it a solidly good movie.I've already seen WW twice, and I look forward to watching it again. Since 2013, there are only about 2-3 other movies I've seen more than once besides this one. So in another surprising way to myself, I would call this easily one of my top 5 favorite movies of the 2010's. It's almost a masterpiece.Update: I've now seen it 2 more times as of Oct 2023 and my review stands. It's a modern classic.8.5/10.","5 out of 6 found this helpful.

I'm pretty much avoiding a mistake that i already have made back then when i watched batman v superman: dawn of justice and suicide squad , and yet left me disappointed. but wonder woman is actually pretty good!I think DC evolve much, i think they learn from their previous mistake that they make such serious, dark, but unenjoyable movie. i could see how much effort to make Wonder woman to have dark serious tone yet still being enjoyable, heart warming, and pretty funny . i still have my comments though, on this matter which i will discuss later. The characters itself are very interesting. before i watched the film, i thought that the character wonder woman is going to be a marry sue (a character who doesn't face any challenges and is good at anything, which i despise). but, thankfully, she doesn't. wonder woman a.k.a Diana has her strengths that make her stands out, yet also has weaknesses that sometimes push her away from achieving her goals in the movie, which makes a good main character development. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine might me the highlight of the movie since i think without their chemistry and also performance the movie wouldn't be as well as it is. their relationship in the film, although a bit cheesy, is what makes the movie more realistic and emotional. the fight scenes are also very fun and action-packed. However, This film's not a masterpiece. it still has things i didn't like and sometimes take me away from the movie. first, the humor. as i said before, i appreciate that DC tries to be more fun with light-hearted comedy, but sometimes i felt as if they stretch a joke too long, that turns chuckles into a cringe. like, OK we get it it's funny now can we move on? second, some lines are also very cheesy. third, pacing. sometimes i felt as if this movie is going too slow yet too fast at the same time. at times i would question a character's motivation because i didn't understand their character very well, which leads into the fourth, the story telling. i know how i mentioned how i love the way that diana and steve character's developed, but as they centered on both of them too much, they as if forget the side characters. side characters are not as important as the main characters but still has their own uses in the plot and the main character motives as well. i felt some characters are so pushed out and forced, that i'm not even feeling sympathetic towards them, which is pretty dull sometimes that i don't feel as emotional the movie wants me to be, and fifth and last, is the CGI. i don't have much to say on this, rather than it's pretty acceptable, but sometimes it takes me away from the movie a little. although, some landscape shots at the beginning of the movie showing themyscira is gorgeous and eye- candy. in conclusion, even with its flaws, i recommend you to watch wonder woman, a movie i would hopefully call a kick-starter for great movies at DCEU at the future!","12 out of 28 found this helpful.

No disrespect to male co star Chris Pine who plays Steve Trevor who himself is trying to save the world from destruction by the Germans, but Gal Gadot kicks butt and brings to her audience a believable female action heroine who certainly shows by her actions that she does not need a man by her side to save her in distress.I really enjoyed the cinematography, as well as the musical score which had great synchronization with the non stop action displayed on the screen. The colour throughout the film was dynamic and crisp and I would put my money down that if Gal Gadot had not been just four (4) years old when Michael Keaton was first presented on the big screen as the Batman back in 1989, we would have in fact had a female action heroine winning over Batman at the box office back in 1989.Congratulations to the women's movement and to all those pre-teens who will try and emulate Diana the Wonder Woman as they grow into adulthood. The day will come maybe in my lifetime when the next Mixed Martial Arts Champion such as Conor McGregor or boxing champion such as Floyd Mayweather when asked who their idol was growing up and their response is Wonder Woman. There will come a time when women will become equal to men in almost every way, including as heroes to emulate, and boys will emulate strong film characters as Wonder Woman. The proof will come when women get paid equal or better than men in Hollywood based on their box office draw and not by their sex.I am a proud man and I congratulate Wonder Woman for the strong message it sends to all its audience. My only dislike was there was a bit too much CGI (Computer-generated imagery) during some of the extended action scenes which should have been edited down. Sometimes too much...is simply too much (CGI). I give the film a sound 7 out of 10 rating.","8 out of 17 found this helpful.

It seem the DCEU was in need of a saviour, at first this saviour came from a meme ‚Äì this had a bruised Batman and tired Superman fighting in an endless war, then beyond that shadow stands Gal Gadot's Diana ‚Äì perhaps the saviour of BvS. After Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman the metaphor loses its sight, and goes into turmoil, in the opening few minutes there's colour, a narration that explains the comings of war between gods and humans and a young Diana Prince (exceptional work from youngster Lilly Aspell) willing to train for a coming war. Her mother (Robin Wright) explains that there is no need to do this ‚Äì after this the origin of the princess progresses to when she is all grown up and has become a trained warrior. The opening origin story is exceptional there's a lot colour which we haven't seen in previous instalments, there's stunning story narration and a wonderful shot of Gadot's Diana training with her auntie (Connie Nielsen) the best fighter on the island. An island inhabited by women until a manly presence invades their homeland enter American spy Captain Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), he speaks of an ongoing war in the outer world. When he's teamed with Gadot their chemistry is magnificent these two work well together and prove to be the dynamic that we need. Pine is exceptional as Steve, he's funny, he's handsome, and he's a charmer who does anything to please our heroine. Diana who's never seen a man before is wonderful to behold especially when she tells Steve about where she comes from. She wants to go with him to go fight the ongoing war ‚Äì meanwhile villainous doctor, Dr. Poison (Elana Anaya) and her warmongering companion Ludendorff (Danny Huston) design dangerous weapons to outfit their soldiers. It's a wonderful story of war and super heroism a mach that never made a keen pairing before but now-a-days it works. It's dark but constantly dark and brooding as the previous films, something that the earlier DCEU intended to rely on Wonder Woman proves that you don't need to be dark to be good. And she does her job well, as Diana Gadot is fantastic she's a beautiful princess who loves the world of men and believes that life has a meaning, as her stronger alter ego she's exceptional, she's strong but on the inside she's vulnerable, unlike the caped crusaders or the men of steel she's not afraid to show emotion and the other wonder woman helming her director Jenkins shows this with exquisite style. Diana was the saviour in BvS, here she proves to be the saviour again who takes no BS. And Jenkins proves that a DC movie can have style too ‚Äì she adds a lot of elements here that makes this super-human feel more human as said she adds emotion there are other elements too the vulnerability makes her a more connectable superhero it proves strength in the female superhero line. Sadly it's not wonderful, in the last 20 minutes it hits a clich√© cg barrier that other superhero movies seem to rely on now-a-days, there are some moments that look they're made from green screen and sadly doesn't make it as good as it could've been. Other than that everything here delivers exceptionally well Jenkins proves that could teach the caped crusaders or men of steel a thing or two with this instalment, it's she's brought new light to the DCEU and it's about damn time.VERDICT: After a few false starts to the DCEU it finally has a success in fantastic style that hits punches with brilliant execution and fabulous performances this is perhaps the best instalment to the DCEU ever, now we can breathe again.","29 out of 51 found this helpful.

Gal Gadot gets the emotional tone of Wonder Woman just right. I'll admit that movie theatre was pretty dusty at times, I'm not crying you are.

Together they fight against evil forces drives the great war, hoping to stop the war and save innocent lives.""Wonder Woman"" is a fantasy tale, telling how a super heroine stops the great war by personally going to the front and fight. I find Gal Gadot very apt as the heroine. She is attractive but still has a fierce and formidable feel to her. The story is a little slow, and it could be edited down by a lot especially in the beginning of the film. The romance subplot distracts rather than adds, but that's just my opinion. There is a good climax, which I think is too short. It could have been lengthened and still remains thrilling.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

The casting was great especially Gal Gadot, Cris Pine, Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen. And also, the decision to use WW1 backdrop and how well it was portrayed was just perfect.The movie has a raw feel to it which makes it extra special. Not a moment will go by where you'll think they tried too hard to fit in the humor, it all comes as natural as natural can be. There is a lot of little moments in the movie that can be appreciated like for example the dancing in midst of war, the romance between Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor. Moreover, the action alone can be a driving factor, which makes me want to watch this movie again and again. Its one like, that we've never seen before.Yes, this movie is not perfect, it has few, a few CGI issues which I think all big action movies have in common (including Marvel movies as well), however, with Wonder Woman its handled really well.I honestly appreciate the hard work and passion that went behind making this movie possible. Some of the people to credit will be Petty Jenkins (wonderful director), Zack Snyder (for having good vision for these movies) and the screen writers. Wonder Woman is a ""mustsee"" movie on big screens.","60 out of 116 found this helpful.

I am not a reader and never read comic books growing up so I am not biased when I watch adaptations which I strongly feel is one of the reasons Wonder Woman has 8.3/10 here and 93% on rotten tomatoes. If Wonder Woman was a spec script this film would not be trending. Until this film Angelina Jolie was the highest earning action Heroine at the US box office with Lara Croft (2001) $131 million. She also managed $118 million with Salt (2010). Scarlett Johanson achieved $126 million with Lucy (2014) and no other actress had been able to carry an action film entirely alone. Hunger games, Star Wars, Divergent and Terminator don't qualify because the male opposite were just as strong.The other reason is that this film is directed by a Female. People love this film because it is the first time a Female director has worked with a big budget like this. $150 million. It has been long time coming. I hope female representation will improve from here on and it seems so because Ava Duvernay also achieved a milestone by becoming the first Black female director to direct an upcoming $100 million film also becoming the third overall behind Katherine Bigelow who did K-9 (2002) for $100 million.I give this film 6/10 because there is nothing groundbreaking like Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight. Its actually half that. Wonder Woman is just another superhero popcorn film whose Lead has an accent giving further evidence that Jews runs the World lol. Wonder Woman is played by Gal Gadot who I think is responsible for the financial success not the story or the CGI. She is genuinely funny, sexy and a great actor. I bet She and Chris Pine who plays the male lead will win the Best Duo at the 2018 MTV movie awards. As for Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen whose names are also on the poster they don't make it past the first ten minutes of the film which is fraud because I love Robin Wright.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

Spinning magic girl transformations have been replaced with a monstrous power that frankly woke me up in my seat. She was my lingering impression and my first taste of a DC that left me wanting more.The Wonder Woman role has big shoes to fill and sadly the shoes themselves will give her a scrutiny male counterparts are not burdened with. Will they be sensible shoes, combat boots or heels? Gal Gadot's counter-argument is a role that is strong, personal and honest. Her tremendous power is counterbalanced with a naivety that reaches beyond comic relief into an often scathing critique of the human leanings toward inhumanity. She reminds us of a bigger picture by becoming a passionate observer of our frailty and in doing so, often exposes her own while retaining all of her strength. In this regard the role of Wonder Woman is an unprecedented success as she struggles to find herself as a person rather than her role as a female superhero.Although aspects of female gender roles are present they develop in other characters. The mother, the amazon, the witch, the submissive - all present as people rather than stereotypes and the roster of strong performances delivers with a confidence that define these women with substance and a dignified strength while avoiding becoming lessons or cautionary tales in femininity.I feel it as important to note that the male characters in this movie also avoid the same gender stereotypes. The men who marginalize her share the same disregard for all life. The men who initially sought to protect her - as we are taught to by our mothers and sisters - quickly fall behind her and support her strength. She is never forced to explain herself.In a genre filled with movies about other movies or stories that build momentum for bigger stories to come it's refreshing to see a movie that delivers a strong tale, genuinely warm characters and manages to embarrass us with the lesson that genuinely strong and honest characters make our gender expectations irrelevant.","18 out of 30 found this helpful.

Directed by Patty Jenkins (2003's Monster), the film not only redeems the DC Universe of some of its previous missteps, but also breathes some new life into the superhero franchise as a whole.In 1918, the Amazonian princess Diana (Gal Gadot) trains with her fellow warrior sisters on the isolated island nation of Themyscira. One day, an American pilot named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash lands near the island. After being rescued by Diana, Steve tells her and the other Amazonians of the outside world and of a ""war to end all wars"" currently being waged by the human race. Refusing to allow the death and carnage to continue, Diana decides to leave with Steve and fight alongside him to hopefully put a stop to the evil people responsible for this war.Featuring a well paced plot and some creatively choreographed action scenes, Wonder Woman is exactly the type of movie that the DC Universe has needed for some time, considering some of the poor creative decisions that were made in its three predecessors. There was also a good balance of humour scattered throughout the story, very much in the vein of some Marvel Cinematic Universe movies, but never so much that it feels forced and tacked on at the last minute. Gal Gadot's performance in the eponymous role is great, her acting range has improved significantly since Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. My only real complaint is that the film does follow a typical ""superhero origin story"" format and does little to detract from that. However, considering how interesting the main character is, this does not draw away too much enjoyment from the overall film.I rate it 8.5/10","52 out of 100 found this helpful.

The visuals are great (although at the end I question the CGI for Ares) but the reason I'm giving it only 9 stars is because the villains are nothing to write home about.

Having said that, it is not great but it is a good comic movie that will satisfy 2 hours. It's not as good as the Nolan films but not nearly as bad as the other recent DC movies. The acting from the leads is solid. As a lifelong Wonder Woman fan, Gal Gadot is my new favorite Wonder Woman by far. She's not perfect acting-wise, but her beauty, confidence and strength sells it. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor is believable and you care about him. The story is simple (bad guy wants to destroy humanity and the heroes stop him) but very focused. The comedy is a lot similar to Thor's but still enjoyable and does its own thing.With all that said, my main issues with the film are with some of the characters (and how they are driven) and the time capsule of the film. Wonder Woman is great but for much of the film, she often feels like a supporting character in her own movie. While not intentional, Trevor is the one that drives the plot and kind of takes over the film. While I like his character, the film is called 'Wonder Woman'. She should've been allowed to make some more decisions for herself. I also want to add that the side characters are passable but could've been better. I honestly didn't really remember them after the movie was over. My other issue is the film being set during WWI. The comics are set during WWII. This made sense since the Nazis ideologies were evil and this was when chemicals were really being advanced (Holocaust anyone?). WWI was a lot more politically complex and was basically the clash of empires. No side was completely innocent. I get this is just for entertainment but, as someone with a history degree, it is distracting. Captain America: the First Avenger worked well with WWII and think Wonder Woman would've made more sense too in that time period. I mean the Germans they're describing are Nazis, not Kaiser imperial soldiers. The film just felt more WWII-ish than WWI. Watch War Horse (2011) to compare. I just wonder (haha) what happened when WWII started for Diana. I guess that was just ""Ares"" too and that'll be the sequel? If so, then what will have been the point in this film or Trevor's fate?There is not much else to comment on. The film looked really good, even beautiful at times. The music was pretty forgettable (no memorable theme that Wonder Woman deserves). Overall, I give the film a B-. It wasn't great but wasn't bad either. I think it is a step in the right direction for DC. I would recommend the film for at least one viewing.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

DC did not have the best record concerning building up their universe, so skepticism was not really out of the ordinary. But the movie proved me wrong and made a lot of things right. And it's really nice that it's the Wonder Woman movie to kick off that trend. I know some will either cherish that and others will hate it - just try to leave the feminism discussion out of it.And enjoy a movie that really captures the making of a superhero. Wonder Woman rising in the best sense. There still are some hurdles that are tough to overcome. The main villain for example has his issues, but for every thing that may not work 100% you have twice or three times as many other things that are really good. Take Chris Pine for example: I wasn't sure if this was necessary casting ... but it very much was. You needed someone who could hold his own. And Gal Gadot really is amazing in this. Looks and beauty aside, she really pulled her weight acting wise.","22 out of 38 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Not wonderful, but better than anything else in the DCEU.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3721060/?ref_=tt_urv","AlexFalzon","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur12561850/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2017","Well, it's finally here. I think it's safe to say that this is one of the more anticipated superhero releases of the last decade, which makes it all the more unfortunate that it had to play within the boundaries of the DC Extended Universe, of which it is the fourth entry. It should be stated up-front that while Wonder Woman is not quite good enough to affect the overall quality of the franchise in any meaningful way, it is certainly better than any of the three films preceding it. The DCEU is on a steady climb upwards; let's hope they don't plateau any time soon.Our framing device sees the Amazing Amazon, in modern-day Paris, receive a photograph from Batman, along with a note asking to one day hear her story. This story begins with her childhood on the Amazonian island Themyscira (there actually is a cute little Paradise Island reference in there, too), her development into a warrior princess and her eventual meeting with the pilot Steve Trevor, who crash-lands into the ocean nearby. After hearing about the Great War, Diana determines that Ares must be behind it and resolves to return to the world of mankind with Trevor in order to vanquish the God of War.The fish-out-of-water elements work greatly, not only in terms of the larger cities and groups of people but also in more intimate settings between Diana and Trevor. The clash of cultures is as thought- provoking as it is hilarious, and these scenes were a great way to let the audience catch a breath between action sequences without getting bored.Because boring, this film is not. At times it can be frustrating, illogical, incoherent and just plain sloppy, but it's never boring. An example of the sloppiness can be found when Trevor refers to the War as ""The War to End All Wars"", before Diana and her mother exit the room and Diana says ""You heard him, mother! He called it 'A War Without End!'"". That's just lazy.The CGI isn't great, and this is especially noticeable in a few scenes where someone falls or leaps from a great height. There's one particularly glaring example where a character is shot in slow- motion, and it's not at all convincing. The music was good, though I was a little disappointed that Wonder Woman's main theme from Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice was used so sparingly. I actually thought that was a big highlight of that movie's score, and was hoping to hear it play over the more badass moments (like when Wonder Woman fights a bunch of bad guys with her lasso; that was excellent!)Where it all fell apart more for me was towards the end. Wonder Woman is sure that Ares is behind the Great War, while Trevor insists that mankind just sucks. Let it suffice to say that the filmmakers attempt to have it both ways, and the result makes little sense. There is also a stupidly pointless death that completely took me out of the film.And so, while it's not a bad movie, the DCEU is still yet to give us a good one. Wonder Woman is probably on par with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the rival MCU's latest film, so at this stage it appears that Fox's Logan is, for now, still the best superhero film of the year. If the DCEU follows its current trend, though, November's Justice League should be an enjoyable watch.Oh, and Wonder Woman is also apparently telekinetic, now, stopping metal with her mind. Considering she already has her bracelets and shockwaves to accomplish the same feat, this felt out of place.http://alexfalzon.com/wonder-woman/ - for more reviews.","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

But the weather was so hot today I whisked my ten year old nephew to the only 'family' movie in our local air conditioned cinema. Immediately this new world was a visual treat, and the necessary background to WW unfolded like a Greek myth. A few hints of the Amazonian women swaggering like chaps in their training camp, and a couple of corny lines from WW love interest Chris Pine delivered in the expository style early on started to eat away at my disbelief, but these minor grumbles didn't portend and the movie grew in drama, spectacle, tension and intensity. My young companion turned to me saying 'this movie is amazing', and I agree. Gal Gadot and Pine are both credible actors (it's not his fault he's too pretty to be a 'real' hero) and they are well served by an above average script (especially for this kind of movie). David Threwlis brings serious acting chops to the table as expected, but the revelation is Lucy Davis, whose comedic sidekick could carry a show of her own. The audience loved her, and laughed along at every nuance. Her charisma bounced out of the screen and reminded me of the superb character actors of the old studios in the decades before the end of that system; e.g. Eve Arden, Margaret Rutherford, Mary Wickes, Joan Blondell et al. Stardom awaits. I won't overplay the feminist/girl power angles, but if my ten year old nephew loved it as he did, then I can confidently say most young boys will too. Drag them there, the girls too! It's a joy.","37 out of 69 found this helpful.

They say they made mustard gas with Hydrogen, which should do nothing to gasmaskes, and differently not break glas. Most chemical weapons react on skin too, so there really is no reason to break the mask at the WW1 level of tech, and differently not if the target is London, which again would not make the English surrender in the war as most of the troops are already at the front at this time. The bomber that has to deliver the weapons are actually more of a ""super weapon"", in this point of time anyway.All in all it feels like they have watch Captain America, added a little more sex, took out the humor, switch the weapon with gas and bad guy with a God, that is stronger than all the Gods combined, but weak against lightning from Wonder Women that he himself just trowed.....","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

Gal Gadot plays Diana, Princess of Themyscira, and daughter of Hippolyta. Best known as Wonder Woman.And by god she kills it in this. Wonder Woman is not merely the best installment of the DCEU so far but it's probably the best DC movie since the Dark Knight trilogy. Wonder Woman is also one of the most entertaining superhero debuts since the first Guardians of the Galaxy. On top of that, there is finally an excellent movie to set the benchmark for future superhero movies about a female hero.Director Patty Jenkins transports audiences to Paradise Island where Amazon warrior women are tasked to defend mankind from the vengeful Ares, the Greek god of war. Their ruler's daughter Diana is kindhearted, brave, compassionate, and courageous. She rescues a dashing spy named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) who informs her people about a greater conflict we know to be World War One. She is appalled by the destruction and onslaught so without question she sets out on a quest to end it.Gal Gadot is the beautiful beating heart of this movie and perfectly cast as Wonder Woman. She's charismatic and authoritative but not so much that she loses her feminine charm and sense of humor. Yes a DC character being funny! Imagine that! Chris Pine is the love interest/sidekick who could honestly serve as the lead of his own adventure movie. Pine is factory built for these types of tough but clever action roles. His chemistry with Gadot is the best romance in a superhero movie since probably the original Spider-Man movies. The supporting cast is a strong one. Connie Nielsen is dignified as the Queen, Robin Wright is her steely lieutenant, Danny Huston is a slimy Nazi-by-another-name, Elena Anaya is her creepy henchwoman, and Lucy Davis plays the comic relief.The movie uses the wartime setting to its advantage. No Man's Land becomes Diana Prince's debut as Wonder Woman. German infantry fight Amazons on horseback. Later the finale boils down to a god versus another god. And yes they use the Lasso of Truth. It's so cool! The timing of this movie couldn't be better. It works splendidly as a summer blockbuster at the very least. But it gives hope to female viewers young and old that women can be heroes too. It gives male viewers a chance to see a true ideal feminist hero in action. It also redresses for the mistakes made in the previous installments of the DCEU and honestly makes me more excited for Justice League","51 out of 100 found this helpful.

"8","/10","""Wonder Woman""- Not only the first truly good film for the DCEU, but just a darned fun movie on its own right!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3724217/?ref_=tt_urv","TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur4669024/?ref_=tt_urv","5 June 2017","If there was one thought to streak across my mind throughout the entire run-time of director Patty Jenkins' long-awaited cinematic adaptation of the iconic comic-book character ""Wonder Woman"", it's a simple word... redemption. This is the first film in DC's struggling Extended Universe to live up to the promise of its comic-book origins. There have been hints at brilliance here and there, but the three previously released films have all ultimately faltered and fallen flat due to their own numerous issues and contrivances and infuriating focus on convoluted style over substance. Not so with ""Wonder Woman""... this is the first film in the entire series that places all of it's focus on delivering a charming, thrilling and entertaining film foremost, where the style is dictated by the story, and not the other way around.If you've grown tired of waiting for the next great DC cinematic adventure. If like me and many others, previous releases like ""Batman V Superman"" and ""Suicide Squad"" left you feeling empty and angry and underwhelmed. If you were worried that the DCEU would just be a constant exercise in misery and tedium... your hopes for something better- something good- have been fulfilled with the absolutely delightful ""Wonder Woman."" It's not a perfect film, mind you. It's uneven at times and suffers the same one-dimensional villains that have plagued the similar Marvel Cinematic Universe. But it is a promise of better things to come in the future, and is not only by and far the best the DCEU has to offer at this point... it's just a darned good film in its own right.On the island of Themyscira, Diana (Gal Gadot) lives in peace, princess of a tribe of Amazon warriors created by the great Greek Gods to protect humanity from the clutches of Ares- God of War. However, the human world soon enough intrudes on Diana's idyllic life when American Spy Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash-lands near her home and she and the other Amazon warriors are told of the ""Great War"" that is taking place- World War I. Diana goes against her mother's wishes and leaves the island with Steve, hoping that in helping him on his mission to stop a deadly chemical attack by the German army, she will be able to confront Ares and put an end to all war. But at what cost will her daring mission come?The great success of ""Wonder Woman"" comes in large part from its simplicity and keen storytelling. It doesn't venture into needlessly lofty and overstuffed (and half-baked) themes and sequel-baiting as has been the case with previous installments of the DC franchise, but instead just tries its hardest to be a competent, concise and entertaining origin story. And that's why it succeeds. Director Jenkins and screenwriter Allan Heinberg smartly concentrate on the fundamentals of character establishment and development above all else, while also giving the film a great deal more personality than has been evident in previous films. With razor-sharp writing, top-notch action set pieces and a constant and appropriate sense of humor that keeps the chuckles coming, you'd be hard pressed not to find yourself grinning ear-to- ear throughout the entire film. The cast is also just a ton of fun. Gadot was by and far the best element in the otherwise sloppy ""Batman V Superman"", but she wasn't given much to do. Here, she absolutely shines and proves herself more than worthy to call herself ""Wonder Woman."" She's got the dramatic chops to handle the heavier moments, the light-hearted whimsy to perfectly land the film's many delightful ""fish out of water"" gags... and she just kicks major butt! I can't wait to see her again on the big-screen. I also quite enjoyed Pine in his supporting role. It's a bit of a standard character, but he gives it the same wonderful personality he's injected to so many other roles. And supporting parts played by the likes of Robin Wright, Connie Nielsen and Sa√Ød Taghmaoui are all exceptionally well-cast and performed.This praise all being said, the film does have some rather large issues that I feel are being generally overlooked. Especially with the film being as hyped up and over-politicized as it has been. Funnily enough, the film suffers a major issue that also desperately plagues many films of their rival studio Marvel- the villains are weak. Pathetic even. Despite having the delightful duo of Danny Huston and Elena Anaya portraying them, the villainous Erich Ludendorff and ""Doctor Poison"" are frankly laughable at times, coming off as so stock as to be ridiculous. At times they even feel like they're in a completely different (and far inferior) film. I know I can't be the only one to cringe when they repeatedly use the old trope of ""villain kills an associate to show he's a threat"" several times to increasingly hilarious results. In addition, the film is a bit uneven as it reaches its midway point, with several key characters from the first act seemingly vanishing and some plot-threads being abandoned for prolonged periods of time. It's a bit distracting. You know the film is capable of so much more.But despite these complaints, I can't help but whole-heartedly recommend ""Wonder Woman."" It's just such a breath of fresh air for this particular franchise thanks to its smart filmmaking and fantastic performances. I was worried before the film came out. Because I will fully admit I have not enjoyed a single other film in the DC Extended Universe to this point, and I was fearing that ""Wonder Woman"" would deal one last fatal blow to the franchise. But it did just the opposite... it revitalized it in the best of ways. And I would favorably compare it to other great superhero origins of the past 10 years, and say it's one of my favorite Summer action films of 2017 thus far.""Wonder Woman"" gets a very good 8 out of 10.","11 out of 17 found this helpful.

I'm always amused that female warriors in Hollywood films are shown with no protection for their thighs or for that mater most of their body.... shin guards and arm guards apparently are enough to protect her from machine guns etc.. Overall a very badly scripted movie based on an incredibly stupid story... Very predictable. Great special effects. If you wanted to watch a film solely for special effects then this would be your film. It had its moment I guess... The humans don't need Aries to be violent (duhh)... otherwise what a pathetic film... Of course to be honest I hate superhero films in general with Logan being about the only exception to the bad scripting bad story telling stupid idea rule in superhero films... I wish Hollywood would grow up and stop telling children stories about fake super heroes in movies. Been hoping since the 1980s for an end to the endless parade of awful movies based on comic books... please let it end!!! I want movies with a story that is worth paying attention to!!!

"6","/10","An over-hyped movie, much too predictable:","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4170613/?ref_=tt_urv","antoniokowatsch","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur67115437/?ref_=tt_urv","19 May 2018","I really don't understand all the hype that surrounds this particular movie. I had pretty high expectations for it and was quite disappointed when I actually got to see it. The only good thing that the movie had going for it was the film score and the cinematography. But if you look at the story line the movie is extremely one-dimensional. There is no real plot and almost no character development, literally. So, there's not much substance to all these high praises that this movie managed to accumulate. It seems. But just to be perfectly clear about it; this movie felt like feminist propaganda. And when I'm saying feminist I'm not referring to the textbook definition of feminism but rather the now established cult of man-hating individuals. As an egalitarian I can totally get behind the ""third wave of feminism"", which has very little in common with today's feminism. But I digress. The reason why I believe this to be the aforementioned type of propaganda is pretty simple to deduce; the protagonist is female, morally superior and virtually invincible (at no point during the movie was the life of the protagonist in any real danger*). Meanwhile all the men are portrayed as ""horny"", dumb, ""needlessly"" violent, expendable, and anything but virtuous. With the sole exception of the other protagonist (aka the ""crashed pilot"") who I'd dare to call a ""token man"" because of what fate awaits him during the end segment of the movie. I don't know about you but I call this very bad story telling. Ideally one should try to make every character just a little bit flawed (even the protagonist), otherwise the whole story just feels like literal propaganda. The writers intent clearly bleeds into the script in this particular case. One would have to be blind to not see that.just to elaborate on the point that I made earlier: the protagonist was never in any situation that one could describe as ""dangerous"". She was clearly overpowered, and just to take the point home; the movie literally starts out with a scene from the end segment of another movie ""Batman Vs Superman"", which literally tells us that no matter what happens in this movie, at the end she'll make it out alive with a memento of a war (the photo). So that scene right there pretty much summarizes half of the movie, no pun intended. To conclude: I feel really saddened. Not by the fact that the movie was rather mediocre but by the fact that most people don't even realize it. That's the real tragedy.Final verdict: watchable, but don't believe the hype. It's not ""that"" good.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

I would guess that most of the negative ""reviews"" are from males in the 18-to-28-year-old demographic who have been weaned on the vast catalogue of male-dominated action-hero films and the increasingly violent video games of the last couple of decades. I suspect also that these ""reviewers"" are not so much disappointed with the movie but more likely threatened by the idea of a woman - and an exceptionally attractive one at that - being the heroine. As a male in my 50s, and one who grew up with hundreds of comic books - Wonder Woman, Superman, Batman, etc - this movie is far closer to my idea of how WW should be treated that certainly the 80s eye-candy that was the TV show. I mean, what do you boys want?! Aside from the odd movie like ""Kill Bill"" and ""Lara Croft"", I can't think of many others where a woman gets to play the hero centre-stage. Yes, there are many flaws with the movie - if you want to nit-pick every single stupid little thing - and guess what? This applies to practically every movie out there. But the fight sequences alone - the choreography and the fact that you can actually see the action (not close-in shots to mask the inadequacy of the actors/directors) - make the movie well worth it.The boys that rate this movie negatively would probably have been far happier with a male director (instead of female), one who perhaps wouldn't have given Gal Gadot as much breadth to threaten the male-dominated super-hero world. This movie is a breath of fresh air in an increasingly confusing and overdone series of super-hero universes. I would love to see a version with a script written by a woman.If you haven't seen this movie yet, and as with any movie anyway, ignore the negative criticism and make your own mind up. I have four daughters and they loved (most of) this movie, and actually found it inspirational. These days, and in this world, anything that inspires my girls gets my nod. Good job, Gal.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

The film is a comic book on the big screen, with a very well written screenplay and a very attractive and full of action story. The cast is fantastic and Gal Gadot and Chris Pine show a wonderful chemistry with their never boring romance. The beauty of the charming Gal Gadot is exotic and sexy she really ""steals the show"" with her perfect performance. The top-notch special effects is state-of-art and impressive. The direction of Patty Jenkins surprises since this is her first blockbuster work. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Mulher Maravilha"" (""Wonder Woman"")","30 out of 57 found this helpful.

America and its the other way around actually, just research the comics and you'll discover the truth, its just that the Captains movie came out before Wonder Woman. But there are some good messages which we all should listen to especially about war. Look forward to Justice League and WW part II this should be very interesting. One final mention Wonder Woman should be more caring and gentle, also a role with Linda Carter as a mentor would be fantastic! I would love to see her, we still love you Linda Speaking about Justice League: Green Lantern must be in the Justice League Movie, even if he makes a late entry at the end of the film for a quick save or to give a last minute assist, he is a founding member, we're talking the original, Hal Jordan. Either ask Ryan Reynolds and Martin Campbell to proceed with part II of Green Lantern Corps movie (the movie was great in my opinion) or just get another actor like Armie Hammer, someone new who looks like a leader, or Jason Bateman and start filming already, okay. Or get another actor, think a young Kevin Costner, whoever he is he must imbue knightly virtues and spirit, a good person. What went wrong in the first film: He should not ride in a car on a track like he did in the film, he is not a kid. He could have just rode in a super hot Mursiellago or Lamborgini or the Bugatti Veyron the 2 million dollar car and that would have been fantastic, see what I mean guys, come on. But hey I loved the green lantern movie minus the mentioned, just make sure he looks cool and is a good guy, strong, leader. Also please keep Blake Lively she was great and as a supporting character and Mark Strong as Sinestro also bring her back Angela Bassett. What went right in the first movie he uses a futuristic machine gun to shoot the evil Elder at the end, he also flies, has a force field, shoots blast out of the ring, and throws giant heavy objects at his opponents all excellent, well done. He could have a green body armor of types, huge and throw all sort of things like a garbage truck, an oncoming train, giant blocks the size of building, and have the green aura / force field show us it also allows him superhuman strength to lift buses, punch falling boulders to smithereens etc., The Lantern rocks, he also happens to be the king of Green as since he doesn't have to destroy any property when he throws things around since they are made from his ring, there is no damage to the environment. I imagine he and Aquaman have a good relationship because of this and because he is like a knight. This is visually spectacular stuff and extremely impressive. Also you must bring Sinestro and the green lantern corps, just make them look better and stay away from some of the chicken aliens yeesh! also Killowag should look better more impressive, bigger, like the thing but not as big as the hulk.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

"7","/10","It is not what you deserve, but what you believe...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3739218/?ref_=tt_urv","paul_haakonsen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22654354/?ref_=tt_urv","25 June 2017","Right, well it was with some mixed anticipation that I went to watch ""Wonder Woman"" in the cinema this weekend. Why? Well, first of all, I am not overly keen on superhero movies, so I had no real incitement or drive for watching this. But then again, I had been told by several people that this was definitely an impressive movie, and one that was well worth the watch even for a non-superhero fan.I watched ""Wonder Woman"" in 3D in the cinema, which was completely pointless, because there were no outstanding or particularly impressive 3D scenes that made you go ""wow!"" So an ordinary 2D viewing of this movie is recommendable.I am somewhat familiar with Wonder Woman from the comic books that I read during my childhood, and also having seen a few episodes here and there from the mid-1970s TV show ""Wonder Woman"". So I didn't really have much of any expectations of what the movie had to deliver for it to be worthwhile.And I must say that I was actually impressed. For a superhero movie then ""Wonder Woman"" turned out to be at the higher end of the scale in terms of being entertaining and watchable.This was definitely Gal Gadot's movie through and through, because she carried the movie so well with her performance as Diana. She has a very charismatic demeanor and her on-screen appearance just demands attention from the audience. So I think that she has been very well cast for the role of Wonder Woman, and I think it will actually be nice to see her again in upcoming superhero movies.""Wonder Woman"" was a visual tour-de-force, and the special effects were impressive and worked very well in favor of the movie. Most of the time it felt like you were right there in the movie yourself, because of the believable special and visual effects. And it was an amazing visual experience to witness Diana run about on the World War II battlefield and take on the Nazis, especially when the scenes were spiced up by those impressive visual effects.And it should also be said that the camera work and cinematography in ""Wonder Woman"" really helped the movie to stand out as well. Lots of great visual presentation of the various scenes throughout the course of the entire movie.The cast in the movie was good, and aside from Gal Gadot, then I was more than impressed with the performances put on by Danny Huston, David Thewlis, Sa√Ød Taghmaoui, Ewen Bremner and Elena Anaya. Danny Huston was great in the villainous role of Ludendorff, and Elena Anaya really nailed the role of Dr. Maru. It was a shame that the Dr. Maru character weren't given more on-screen time, because that character had a lot of potential and could have proved so much more effective had the writers opted for more focus on her. However, the casting of Chris Pine was puzzling to me, because he will forever be Associated with a substitute captain Kirk from the ""Star Trek"" reboots.The characters found in the movie were well-rounded and quite nicely detailed and fleshed out on the screen. There was just about enough character development and growth for all characters to make them all matter and have importance to the storyline. However, some could have benefited more from having more on-screen time, of course.One thing that failed, aside from the offbeat and misplaced attempts of comedy, was the fact that the German's didn't speak German. That small feat and detail brings so much flavor and believably to the movie. So I was puzzled why they hadn't opted for that kind of authenticity.There were some misplaced attempts at bringing humor into the movie, which didn't sit well with me, and it stuck out like a sore thumb in comparison to the rest of the movie. For example, with the impressive feats and abilities that the Amazons showed, then why did Diana have such problems with a simple, rotating swing door? It was just a laughable attempt at comedy that should never have been in the final cut of the movie.I was genuinely entertained by ""Wonder Woman"", and I will say that director Patty Jenkins definitely stepped up to the task and delivered where it mattered and where it counted. Regardless of if you like superhero movies or not, then ""Wonder Woman"" is definitely worth taking the time to sit down and watch.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Or what were they smoking when they decided to release Wonder Woman (WW) before Justice League?Whatever they were smoking, the latter was the better stuff because the only word I can think off describing this movie is fantastic !! Yup !!The previous two releases with huge star casts and big budget action sequences were to be told in truth plain boring. WW is like the monsoon in India, refreshing and entertaining.To be frank, there is nothing new in WW if you scratch the surface. It is the coming of age of person who has superpowers and fights a villain to protect the world, a sample template of all superhero films.But WW is different because the superhero is a woman and that where Patty Jenkins and the writers catch our attention and surprise us. When was the last time we saw a movie completely dedicated to woman superhero?? They get most of things perfect from the word go. Amazons, the place where WW is born and belongs to is visually mind blowing and beautiful. The warrior women star cast is perfect with Nelson and Wright perfectly playing Diana's mother and aunt. Special mention to Wright who is terrific in action sequences inspite of her age.And then comes Chris Pine who is so happy to play second fiddle to WW. He is the catalyst and the wow factor for women audience. He and WW share a fabulous chemistry on screen and have some nice comic moments too.The movie takes time to build up and the setting of WW One is prefect. And there is that one beautiful action set piece with WW taking on the Germans on the battlefield and single handedly destroying them. Perfect.And finally, there is Gal Gadot aka WW aka Diana. Gadot seems to have been born to play WW. She has the physique, the personality and the acting skills to play this role. I don't think any other actor would have done justice to this part. She is breath taking in the action sequences and what we saw of her in Batman vs Superman was just a trailer. She owns this role.The action sequences are good and the technically its a pretty neat film.However, the climax was tad disappointing and the villain was big let down. Thewlis is fine actor but not suited to play the villain. Plus the villain's role was poorly written. Even Dr. Maru's role was not well written and I hope to see more of her sometime in the future.But its still a great film and a must watch for movie buffs. If you are a woman you will love it as its all about women empowerment. For men, watching Gadot in short skirts beating the hell out of the bad guys is fulfilling. Can't wait for the sequel. he he he.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

But not only did this exceed expectations, but it also SAVED its franchise from destruction.Wonder Woman is not only the best superhero movie of the year by far, but it's also the best female-led superhero movie out there. Thanks to several strengths, it's elevated by powerful writing that tells an engaging story, master-class visual effects, engaging action scenes, a cast of likable characters, and a positive message of female empowerment that actually WORKS. My best recommendation is that this is one of those films any superhero fan will enjoy, but this could also be for those who want something with good female empowerment in their lives. Just to give something good other than the crap we've gotten from 2017. Well, now Wonder Woman got her movie, now we just have to wonder who's next.","7 out of 10 found this helpful.

As with most DC Comics films, this one was a great disappointment. While Marvel Comics films tend to be satirical and even self-effacing, DC films are pretentious and tedious. Sadly, Wonder Woman was no exception to this rule.The scripting was totally unimaginative, with dialogue that bordered on infantile. Visually, the landscapes all seemed plastic, with B-movie grade CGI throughout. Even the music was awkward, fighting the dialogue during the more intimate moments and drowning each scene in instrumentals. I found myself doubting whether the director and editor are aware that there doesn't have to be a bombastic or flowery incidental score under everything ‚Äî it displayed a lack of confidence in the dialogue and acting carrying the scene.Regarding the acting, both Gadot and Pine gave it their best, struggling with the stilted dialogue and boring, telegraphed story line ‚Äî but even they couldn't transcend this quagmire. If not for its pretentiousness, this film would have played far better as a comedy, lampooning itself. Instead, it drowns itself in incessant platitudes of women good/men bad, framed within a plebian one-dimensional plot.Again, I'm at a loss to explain its high marks, other than to ascribe it to the currently trendy political correctness that elevates all patronizing misandry to high art and entertainment.","146 out of 308 found this helpful.

I admit i was having lot of doubts before getting to this movie. First of all, still no review yet on RT only few days before US opening ( always a bad sign). Few users' reviews on the web and they seems to be too good to be REAL. And yesterday i saw few users here saying those good reviews are fake and giving horrific 1 star and rant on the movie ( will get back to this on the latter part), my heart dropped dead. Forgetting all those worries and trying to be neutral as best to see what i am going to get out from this film, i could say i should never saw those evil, brutal 1 star users' ""what to say"". This movie is REALLY REALLY GOOD!!!! Those good reviews are no lie at all. Everyone agrees wonder women was the highlight Of the BVS. This movie elevates that into another level!! The story really give depth to the character, Gal Gadot is really charming as the wonder women. The action sequence was made beautifully and the final act was just WOW that it gave me a chill that i was longing for a superhero film.Inevitably, people do compare this to those Marvel works. For me, Wonder woman is on pal with Ironman 1 & Captain America 2 winder solider. And people have to bear in mind DC is always different from Marvel, that is the reason it make this movie or DC movie so cool. i do enjoy watching Marvel stuffs, they are always entertaining and action packed, but that's all, they are kind of forgettable and lack of depth. Except Ironman 1, CA2 or maybe civil war, i don't really think other Marvels are really that great, some are even not good to me (i.e. Thor, IM3..). DC movie is not afraid of stepping into the dark side of the human heart, it will give u something meaningful to ponder on....WonderWomen's backstory is set on the WW1, the darkest moment for the humanity. it is the path for wonder women to realize who she really is and what she stands for out of knowing human is the one to blame for all the evil and terrible things they are capable of but human is also fond of love and capable of building better world. The story is so compelling.To those people who could rate movie at 1 star. i mean how could you do that just because you don't like it or simply you are fan of Marvel. We really need different kind of movies more than just always one similar formula.","37 out of 73 found this helpful.

Her ego is reinforced by the knowledge that she was made of clay with life breathed into her by the God Zeus. ¬†It's enough to turn a girl's head!It's 1917 and the man-free paradise is shaken up when an American spy by the name of Steve Trevor (Chris Pine, ""Star Trek: Beyond"") crash- lands in the waters off Themyscira. ¬†(And yes... you didn't mishear me... this film genuinely features a hero with both the names ""Steve"" and 'Trevor""). Prince Eric - no, sorry, wrong film - is saved and awakened on the beach by Diana as the others arrive. ¬†""Thank God!"", say the Amazonians. ""At last, someone to process the 200 year backlog of washing and ironing""! ¬†But Steve (an ""above average specimen"", LOL) is not long for paradise as he needs to return to the war with the results of his spy-work: a chemistry book stolen from the gorgeously deformed Dr Maru (Elena Anaya), gas-developer for the evil General Ludendorff¬†(Danny Huston). Seeing Ludendorff to be her God-like nemesis Ares, Diana returns with Steve to the WW1 battlefields with the intent of killing the God of War and so ending the 'war to end all wars'.Much 'fish out of water' fun is had with Diana meeting civilised London society, although perhaps this section of the film doesn't quite live up to its full potential: ¬†having ice cream for the first time, without any sign of surprise, all she can come up with is an amusing but rather lame ""You must be very proud"".But where the film really accelerates into awesomeness is when Diana reaches the trenches. She emerges from the trenches like some shimmering vision of hotness, to set male and lesbian hearts a flutter. Its the most memorable trench-exit since the finale of ""Black Adder 4"", and the subsequent scenes of Diana single-handedly facing the German guns is for me one of the most compelling and enjoyable scenes in any recent DC or Marvel movie.Holding all this together is the ex-Israeli army-trainer Gal Gadot in the title role. And man oh man, what a Gal! Statuesque, athletic but also sweet, charming and emotionally fragile she completely owns this role from beginning to end. ¬†Gadot made a memorable entry in the otherwise poor ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (#marthagate #neverforget #neverforgive) but nothing prepares you for just how great she is in this outing. Chris Pine - the thinking women's Chris Pratt - once again proves himself as a talented actor who manages to successfully morph to inhabit the role he plays. Much as he did in the excellent ""Hell or High Water"", not once did I equate him to be James Tiberius Kirk after the first 5 minutes.¬†Effective in supporting roles are David Thewlis (""Harry Potter"") as a 'helpful' army bod and an almost unrecognisable Lucy Davis (""The Office"") as Etta, Steve's comedic secretary. ¬†Steve's rather unlikely sidekicks of Sameer (Said Taghmaoui, ""American Hustle""), Charlie (Ewen Bremner, ""Trainspotting"") and 'The Chief' (Eugene Brave Rock ""The Revenant"") all rather fade into the woodwork by comparison.¬†I saw the film in 3D (""careful now... you could take an eye out with those things"") and very good it was too. Aside from some rather unnecessary Amazonian arrows, its never feels overdone, and elements of it were extremely effective.Another star of the show is the superb Wonder Woman theme by Hans Zimmer, here rolled out by the film's composer Rupert Gregson-Williams (""Hacksaw Ridge""). Unfortunately, the rest of the soundtrack is not particularly memorable.The film shifts into more traditional yawn-worthy 'superhero finale' mode in the last twenty minutes, which is a bit of a shame. Patty Jenkins (""Monster"") directs and knows the audience she is aiming to please. One can only imagine the empowering impact this film will have on young girls, crossing their wrists and in their imagination casting terrorists into the hell that they should be consigned to. In this week of yet more Isis atrocity in London, Wonder Woman is a role- model we could all stand and salute: ""I believe in love"" too.(This is an abridged version of the One Mann's Movies graphical review.

She's not cocky, she's assertive, she's not arrogant, she wants to learn and has humility, Wonder Woman is a real character not just another hero in tights being super. The direction from Petty Jenkins works well, the pace builds after a nice set up, it looks great and the WW1 setting gives the plot some depth and context. The main villain at the end could have been better but that's a small gripe. This is Fun, inspiring, exciting, emotional and entertaining. One of the best super hero movies for sure.","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

And yes, this was sort of what I was hoping and expecting 1984 to be like, or at least be more like.As far as the comic book genre goes, in my opinion, this movie is a masterpiece. It truly is. It was everything it could possibly be, and maybe a little bit more. Every scene was perfect with only a couple exceptions. There is beauty, symbolism, depth, and good acting at every main part. It even had some really funny scenes sprinkled in that were unexpected.Although the action scenes toward the end were a little bit cliche, they were necessary to the story and still differentiated themselves for some uniqueness, which is all you can ask for in that setting.This is the movie I wanted and hoped for out of WW 1984. I'm glad the disappointment with that led me to finally watch this. It was way better than expected.9/10 (rounded up due to being underrated as it should be at least a 7.8-7.9 on here total if not more).","8 out of 12 found this helpful.

(Marston's other claim to fame is the invention of the lie detector.) Although Superman and Batman were selling well to kids, there was a wave of pseudo-psychology which claimed that comic books were poisoning the minds of impressionable youths. Detective Comics (later renamed DC) were frightened that these radical groups were influencing the voting public which might hire lawmakers to ban comic books altogether. DC hired Marston to address this problem. Rather than changing existing comic books, Marston offered an unexpected solution: make a female superhero, i.e. a super-heroine. The result was Wonder Woman.Little did DC comics know Marston had been involved in the early suffragette and birth-control movements of the early 20th century, and he incorporated much of the iconography and symbolism into the comic book. Wonder Woman's looks was originally a hybrid of the Varga pin-up girl posters of the 1940's and Suffragettes of the early 20th century. For example, Wonder Woman's early adventures often involved her being chained, an icon used by feminists and suffragettes in the early 20th century in propaganda posters and political illustrations. When chained, Wonder Woman loses her powers. Her magic lasso compels the person being lassoed to tell the truth, an obvious reference to Marston's lie detector. The comic was an instant hit and even became iconic for the Women's Liberation Movement of the 1970's.Fast-forward to 2017. Patty Jenkins has directed an outstanding film on a screenplay by Allan Heinberg from a story by Heinberg, Zack Snyder and Jason Fuchs based on the DC Comics character. Starring Gal Gadot as the title character and Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, this superhero action film flies as fusing of Ancient mythology and human history, and the offering is one of the best of the genre since the original ""Superman"" film starring Christopher Reeve (1979). Like ""Superman"", ""Wonder Woman"" begins with the backstory of the title character. Her name is Diana, daughter of Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nelson) and she lives on Paradise Island where only women reside whose culture is a throw-back to Ancient Greek mythology. (Paradise because there are no men to screw things up...?) Diana as a youth is taught by the best combat teacher of the island, General Antiope (Robin Wright) in the ways of combat and becomes the best among her peers.Sticking to the origins, Captain Steve Trevor, an American spy working for the British, is being chased by Germans during the First World War and crashes off the coast of Paradise Island. He has in his possession plans written by Dr. Poison (a real character from DC Comics). After a confrontation between Amazons and the Germans, Trevor is taken in by the Amazons and forced to reveal who and what he is. Eventually, Diana decides she must go with Trevor back to ""the world of men"" and help stop the war. Her reasons are mythological in which she must stop the ""God of War"". Of course Trevor doesn't buy into Diana's myth story but plays along to get back to the war. They sail by boat back to London.One of the best sequences is Diana's introduction to early 20th century society. Gadot offers an excellent performance as the slightly culture-shocked fish-out-of-water but never overplays it. She tries on a pouffe dress which definitely wouldn't be ""Wonder Woman"". Eventually, she dons a suitable outfit and signs onto a mission with Trevor and several marginal characters to stop a fatal gas attack which makes the mustard gas of the war seem like the steam from a sauna. The inventor is Doctor Isabel Maru, a.k.a. Dr. Poison who has been supported by General Ludendorff. (In fact Ludendorff was a real general in the First World War and was involved in Hitler's so-called Beer Hall Putsch to overthrow the German government in 1923.) The mission is not sanctioned by the war office of London but in secret with only one member of Parliament offering assistance, Sir Patrick Morgan (David Thewlis). This merry band of misfits, a woman who knows nothing about western society and culture, a Scottish drunk, a Native American pacifist, an Italian actor, and an American spy make their way to the front lines of the First World War.An outstanding film all around with excellent performances and a good balance between story and action. The filmmakers made the decision to withhold Diana becoming ""Wonder Woman"" until nearly half-way into the film, similar to ""Superman"". One of the best decisions: she never says ""I'm Wonder Woman"". A superhero speaking his or her name is a fatal screenplay error made by many other screenwriters who shall remain nameless.","23 out of 43 found this helpful.

Wright especially takes what she's given in the role and makes the most of it, I found myself wanting to spend way more time with her Antiope.I'm thankful that Patty Jenkins gifted us with a Wonder Woman that my daughter can look up to, the way I looked up to Superman when I was a kid.

They strike me as philosophically superficial Bayesque things.For most of its running time, WW is about characters, who have well-considered philosophical positions. There's no rubbing your nose in those positions, but they're consistent.The absolute strength of WW is in its writing. Which isn't to say that any other bits are bad-- the acting is certainly adequate, although it is a a super-hero flick, not Osage August Count, so the bar is not that high. The direction and editing are fine, and where they fail, it's due to trying to be original, rather than trying to be the same as everything else-- even its directorial failures are a plus in my book.WW doesn't try to be anything particularly amazing. It's just a superhero movie. Eventually, it turns into boring action for its own sake. But ""eventually"" puts it miles beyond every other superhero movie I've ever seen. Meanwhile, before it gets there, it manages to be smarter than any other superhero flick I've seen.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

This one was felt as a combination of fun and a little bit dark altogether. This movie was telling the origin of Wonder Woman and I think it was told in a very nice way. The earlier part showing Diana since her childhood was quite nice to see. What I loved the most was actually the moment when Diana went to London for the very first time. It was truly fun to see the naivety of her in the ""man's world"" and I think Gal Gadot's portrayal in these scenes were very spot on.What I loved about this movie was also the way Diana evolved from the innocent Amazon woman to what she became at the end. I believe the duration of the movie was just nice even though it was a little bit over than 2 hours. Some might feel it was too long at the beginning but it should not be considered as a flaw. My wife and I really enjoyed this movie. I know she was touched during those emotional moments and I know she loved Gal Gadot portraying Wonder Woman.Chris Pine was charming as Steve Rogers and his chemistry with Gal Gadot seemed very nice. The awkward moments during their trip back to London were very fun to see as well. Steve's allies particularly Sameer was the stand out one. Apart from the fun part, there were also some dark moments and emotional moments as well, reminding us that DC superhero adaptation movies would always have dark tone, but it was not as dark as the other earlier movies. Those of you who prefer lighter tone would definitely be able to enjoy this.This movie was directed by Patty Jenkins who had just 1 movie to her credit prior to this one, albeit a very highly critically acclaimed one titled Monster (with its main cast Charlize Theron won the Golden Globe and Academy Awards). It was a surprise to me that she was able to make the action sequence looked very cool. The special effects was wonderful. The fight scenes were nice. The sound effects were great, especially since I saw this in a theater with Dolby Atmos sound system. The dramatic, emotional, fun scenes were nicely done by Jenkins. All around I think she did a wonderful job directing this movie and hopefully it would bring more audiences to flock the theaters.For those who are expecting to see post-credit scene, be informed that this one did not have any, just like in Batman VS Superman: Dawn of Justice. I guess they did not really want to be seen just like any other Marvel movies? (Although there was some brief mid-credit scene in Suicide Squad). In conclusion, I believe this one was a wonderful superhero movie from DC comics. Not since Elektra in 2005 that a female superhero became the lead of a movie based on comic books. Not even Marvel had it in the Marvel cinematic universe. Perhaps after this, they would be making an independent movie of Black Widow? Anyway, for those of you who prefer Marvel comics movies compared to DC comics movies due to their lighter tones, I think this one would surprise you. For those who are die hard fans of DC comics, I am sure you would be coming to see this one anyway. But for those who just enjoy the movies adapted from any comic books, you should be able to enjoy this one. Just watch this and you would understand what I meant.For my complete review pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id","22 out of 41 found this helpful.

Even though Gal Gadot's acting isn't stellar in my opinion, I think she's really charming and fit the roll nicely. I watched this in a history through film class for WWI, so we looked at comparisons during the battle scenes with gases, trenches, etc. Although their isn't a magical pill you break open to give you super-human strength in real life, some of the other stuff was pretty accurate. I haven't seen other work directed by Patty Jenkins, but I'm hoping the next Wonder Woman installment will be just as good.","13 out of 22 found this helpful.

As she fights the Great War, she inspires humanity to rise up and be their better selves but is eventually confronted with the fact that humanity is not the essentially good brotherhood she thought it was and Ares' influence is far more devious and subtle as well.The questions at the heart of this film are ""Will Diana despair when faced with reality,"" and ""Is humanity, with all it's dark impulses, worth saving. This struggle is so much more relatable than watching Superman try to beat up another strongman who is going to enslave humanity.Diana empathizes with dying soldier's and comes to the rescue of small villages instead of flying past dying civilians and toppling building by throwing bad guys into them. She sees how evil men can be and is brokenhearted, not angered. She is a hero that wants to end war, not wage it.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

So going in I was excited but also realistic, in that I try to not have my expectation too high.And boy I was not disappointed, I had an absolute blast watching it. The action is amazing, the shots were beautifully shot and directed. The highlight of the film is of course Gal Gadot and Chris Pines who both owned the roles of Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor. Even the supporting cast provided some great humor and depth, it really made me care about each characters.The only gripe I had was there was some disappointment with the antagonist. The antagonist is not bad in anyway, in fact the antagonist is visually cool looking, but I realize that the antagonist is not the best villain, good but just disappointed.All in all, it is easily one of the best blockbuster films this year, had an amazing time. So go out and watch it, you'll sure find something entertaining out of it.","43 out of 88 found this helpful.

But I'd be happy to give it 8 or even 9. Why 10 then?Captain Marvel has a 7.1 on IMDB. Wonder Woman is only .4 ahead of it. That's a crying shame.Gal Gadot NAILS this character. Her strength, her courage of conviction.. it gives me goosebumps when I think of certain scenes and how righteous and powerful she is.
Chris Pine is also great, and the chemistry between him and Gadot is charming, well-done, and so well-written. Some of the CGI is spotty, but there are some beautiful sequences as well (such as when her mother is teaching her their history).The third act, and the fight with Aries borders on 'meh'. I also thought the cast of misfit soldiers was kind of annoying at times, and also why did they attend that party in that castle? That whole part where they passed high-level German security with bad German accents was very ridiculous.But overall, the movie is actually a fun experience. It makes you feel things. When WW goes ""over the top"" of the trenches with her shield, I literally raised my fist in the air and cried 'yes!' (I'm a guy btw).I have watched WW three times and will gladly watch it again. I saw Captain Marvel recently and will NEVER watch it again. Wonder Woman is an excellent example of a female-led superhero movie done more-than-mostly right, CM is flat, dull, uninspired, and deserves a 3/10, not 7.","11 out of 18 found this helpful.

The actors are all very good, with the exception of the Ares Actor. He tried, but the script was not written in favor of him, obviously. It seemed they forgot how important an interesting enemy is, especially for comicbook adaptions/superhero movies. The setting is a nice and dark choice, but it works.

This film is very different from what we usually see within the superhero subgenre. The first two acts are wonderful, especially after leaving Themyscira and in the trenches scene. The choreographies are incredible, the photography is good, it has an interesting direction. However, from this moment on, the film begins to deteriorate a lot. The third act is boring, it's tiring and it doesn't seem to be the same movie anymore since the pace of it was great. For an hour and a half it tried to be different only to end up being a generic superhero battle. It never had anything so different from other films in general, but within the subgenre it managed to work something new and it worked very well, unfortunately the third act pulls the film down.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It just all was whipped along as if for the sake of completing the movie. None of the characters were likable and relatable on a psychological level. Comic relief was forced and did not make us laugh. Watching Diana do her innocent act was totally unbelievable and as fake as it can get.I fell asleep. My girlfriend well asleep and my friend who is generally very tolerating of dumb movies EVEN he fell asleep.But that's okay, not a lot of movies are necessarily good.

I'm also super-picky about movies in general. Having said this, I found Wonder Woman uncommonly refreshing...better than 99% of what comes out of Hollywood these days. Why?Gal Gadot - Her screen presence is breathtaking...mesmerizing. She portrays strength with vulnerability, naivete with intelligence.Chris Pine - His timing and delivery are spot-on as usual. I bet every director loves working with this guy.Cinematography - From the muted colors of WWI to the lush island paradise, brilliant.The story - It's not Shawshank but the emotive elements are all there. Engaging from start to finish.The mythology - Basic but intriguing and credible. Great tension is created against the prevailing left-brained mindsets.The jokes - Corny at times but for the most part they provided nice relief from the drama without ripping the viewer out of the moment like every other superhero movie.The twist - People hate on it but I bet no one saw it coming.Anyway, forget all of this -- the movie just works.

However, the couple had other interests as well. In 1941, they created the character ""Wonder Woman"" for publisher DC Comics. The role model was their young, polyamorous life partner. In a magazine interview, William Marston stated that the couple wanted to produce an alternative to the then popular (male) superheroes.Right from the beginning ""Wonder Woman"" appeared on many different media platforms. TV shows, radio programs, video games and a couple of action movies have all, on various occasions, hosted her shenanigans. The gal has also been featured in contemporary artwork on a regular basis. Most famously in pieces by American so-called ""pop artists"". Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, to name just a few.Warner Brothers started to plan for a new ""Wonder Woman"" movie at the beginning of 1996. But, after failing to come up with a workable screenplay, the entire project got stuck in development hell. The intended picture was finally abandoned in 2002.But, never say never. In 2015, Warners decided to put ""Wonder Woman"" back on the silver screen again. And this time the studio executives decided that they wanted a female director. Patty Jenkins, who just a few years earlier had directed ""Monster"" with Charlize Theron, seemed to be the right woman for the job. Especially considering that picture's great artistic and commercial success.Although the film was not aimed exclusively at young women, the marketing department at Warnes realized that this demographic could constitute an important target group. So, a few weeks before the premiere, a promo for the movie was released during the season finale of the TV-series ""Supergirl"". And it worked. ""Wonder Woman"" turned out to be the highest-grossing film of any female director ever.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

After being introduced to the general public in cinemas in ""Batman vc Superman"" that already gave us a very good idea of who the character was and what she was capable of doing and now, the wait is finally over. To bring this super powerful woman to the screen, she was called Patty Jenkins, who does not have as many jobs on her resume, but who became known worldwide for directing Monster (2003) that gave the Oscar for Best Actress to Charlize Theron for playing Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute who becomes the first serial killer woman in history.
One of the great strengths of the production is the script by Allan Heinberg - egress from TV series like ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Sex and The City"" - which builds a script with many merits, respecting the origin story of Wonder Woman bringing to it highlights several other aspects. Setting the plot at the end of the First World War, the script manages to present aspects of the behavior and customs of society from the beginning of the 20th century, and issues related to the power of those who are in charge of nations, political decisions, all still permeated with gods and legends. mythological, as well as dilemmas of whether or not humanity deserves to be protected by the Amazon.
The film begins today, after the events of 'Batman v Superman - Origin of Justice', and shows Diana Prince, who works in the Antiques Department of the Louvre, receiving a World War I photograph from his mail sent by Wayne Enterprises, when you start to remember your past. So we are transported to the beginning of the 20th century, when we see little Diana, who has always wanted to train with the other Azones, but who was prevented by her mother Hippolyta, who hid her father's identity from Diana, thought she you shouldn't worry about that in times and peace and that you should play like a child and not fight. Over time, Hippolyta is convinced by Antiope and Diana then starts to train more than any other Amazon. When pilot Steve Trevor crashes on his plane and is rescued by Diana, all Amazons learn about the dangers that surround the isolated Paradise Island in the world of men.
These first forty minutes of the plot are dedicated to telling Diana's childhood, showing how life is on Paradise Island, and better setting the viewer in Greek-Roman legends. With Diana's departure with Steve, it is interesting to note Diana's still naive gaze on humanity, especially in a time of war. The contrast of this naivete in her eyes with that of the experienced pilot and spy Steve is when we realize that she was there embarking on a transformative journey towards London where her beliefs would be confronted. In fact, arriving in the English capital, more aspects of this naivety in relation to the customs of society are understandable and a highlight of the film alongside Etta Candy (Lucy Davis), Steve's secretary. While Diana was born and raised trained to be a warrior, she does not understand the use of dresses, fashion, etc. Even going through a revolving door in your new outfits and a sword becomes a hilarious challenge and trying ice cream for the first time becomes a unique experience. There is also time to be impressed by man-made weapons to kill people. Even the struggle for the right to vote - which would only be won years later - is cited as a criticism of society at the time. The same criticism used later when Diana enters a military audience where only men are allowed. And what about Diana confronting the coldness of political decision and calling the general a coward for allowing soldiers to die on the front lines of battles? Just what we expect from the character. The best of ""Wonder Woman"" is due to this meeting of two peoples: Diana's, composed only by women; and ours, where women had (still have) fewer rights and opportunities than men. The script is fanciful in scenes where the current machismo is ridiculed with pleasure by the protagonist.
The script uses the entire first half of the plot to insert Diana into the world of men and develops the character in a slow, careful and skillful way. And from the final half, Diana is able to show her skills to humans, with special emphasis on the scenes when the team reaches the Western Front in Belgium, they are interrupted by enemy machine guns, but Diana leaves alone in the middle of no-man's-land and gathers allied forces behind it to free the village of Veld. The scenes of Diana appearing behind the barricades and facing the enemy soldiers is epic, as well as the scenes in which she invades through the windows the places where she faces

The scenes of Diana appearing behind the barricades and facing the enemy soldiers is epic, as well as the scenes in which she invades through the windows the places where she faces several German soldiers to the sound of the heroine's theme song. In the final stretch, there are also the excellent action sequences with Diana's fight with Ludendorff and, especially afterwards, against another unexpected villain amidst many destructions, shots and explosions.
One of the highlights of the film is the relationship between Diana and Steve and that was essential for the film to work. Since Diana rescued him from the sea, we have noticed a sexual tension between them. The complicity between the two only grows over the two hours of projection and makes us cheer for the couple at all times. The chemistry between Gal Gadot and Chris Pine is evident and the scene in which he teaches her to dance under the snow and then go to the bedroom and surrender to the love they feel for each other is the culmination of the couple's relationship building. It is in Steve that she knows love and better understands the human action. Humanity's decision is the cause of war and violence, but humanity is also much more than that. It is a humanity capable of loving and that deserves another opportunity. It is also worth highlighting the duo that leave with Diana and Steve to destroy another arms factory together with Ludendorff and Maru. Spy Sameer (Sa√Ød Taghmaoui), excellent sniper Charlie (Ewen Bremner).
If most of the film builds an exciting film in both visual and narrative, the ending, despite having twists and turns, cannot escape much of the concept of elevating action at the expense of coherence. They are minutes of much noise for nothing, without any direct contribution to the lesson that the heroine needed to learn about humanity. These are moments when the director changes the retro look and uses more practical effects for a more obscure and full of green screen effects.
The production of the film also deserves all the praise. Production designer Aline Bonetto, photography by Matthew Jensen are incredible in perfectly setting the time of the First World War in both sets and costumes. It is a war movie with the presence of a superhero, making everything more real and believable even with all the fantastical aspects that involve the origin of the heroine. The soundtrack by Rupert Gregson-Williams is sensational. The composer mixes action themes very well, using the character's theme music very well in moments when he detonates his enemies and also several stretches of pure emotion in the midst of the climate of war. In the post-credits we still have the Australian singer Sia, who wrote a song for the film, entitled ""To Be Human"", with the English musician Labrinth, who is also on the soundtrack.
'Wonder Woman' is a film with excellent production, with a first script and that works thanks to the direction of Patty Jenkins and the scenic presence of Gal Gadot. The choice of the dietician is not only for the symbology of a woman directing a film of a female protagonist in an action film but, consequently, also for being the first woman to direct a superhero film with a female protagonist in Hollywood. Just to abuse the clich√©s of films of the genre such as slow cameras and camera turns in the beating scenes, the scenarios where these scenes take place end up differentiating the film from so many others of the genre.
The Israeli actress, on the other hand, manages to pass the still naive look of young Diana in the land of men, all her discoveries and dilemmas, which contrast very well with the wiser posture of the character of the first and last scenes of the projection. Diana was very well represented as a normal woman. A woman with very high values, but still a woman. It can be sensitive. She is smart and emotionally independent. She may be confused. She may lose her confidence or not. She's everything. She has a human heart. The actress exudes charisma, easily switching between the sweetness of a young woman discovering a world different from her own and the strength of a warrior who distributes tapas without losing her hairstyle.
'Wonder Woman' is the best film in DC's eccentric extended universe, a work of great quality, quite faithful to its original material, which was a box office success and which will certainly generate new sequences. It is a symbol for women and it came to break barriers and prejudices. It is full of light, color, heart and a cohesive history, characteristics that make it one of the best of its kind in recent times.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

After Wonder Woman's appearance in Batman v Superman in 2016, she gets her own standalone film.In keeping with the Justice League universe, the film has that dark and murky look. We get a long drawn out beginning of a young girl who is a descendant of a Greek god wishing to train to be a warrior despite her mother's resistance to the idea.We then see a grown up Amazonian princess, Diana (Gal Gadot) who develops little muscular physique despite all her training with fellow warrior sisters on a mystical isolated island of Themyscira.When an an American pilot Steve (Chris Pine) crashes near this island followed by German soldiers, the Amazonians learn of an outside world where humans are engaged in a great war, the first world war. Diana leaves her island with Steve and goes to London with a desire to stop the war.Steve has found out about a German chemist called Dr Poison trying to develop chemical weapons that would render gas masks useless in a background of both sides to the war having peace talks. Diane believes that Ares, the god of war is responsible for the human misery caused by warfare. The film improves once the action moves to London but there are problems with the story. It is weak, when a sinister German general is disposed off well before the end of the film, it just confirms that a certain character is going to be the big bad of the movie.Some of Steve's ragbag of associates who are there for camaraderie and comic relief are useless. A marksman who cannot shoot.The film feels overlong and underwhelming. You have to suspend a lot of disbelief in Wonder Woman's acrobatic abilities as well parrying bullets with her wrist bands.Gadot showed promise in her appearance in Batman v Superman last year, but carrying a film on her own exposed her limitations as an actress. Her range is limited and in many scenes she is just required to pose and replaced by CGI either in slow motion or sped up.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

The story, characters, and setup are the best DC has offered since ""The Dark Knight Rises."" One drawback, however, is DC's overreliance on CGI, which sometimes makes it hard to discern if we're still watching live action or a Pixar movie. Thankfully, these heavily CGI-laden scenes are brief, unlike ""Man of Steel,"" which prominently showcases its digital effects.Despite this, ""Wonder Woman"" remains a powerful and compelling film, easily becoming one of my favorite movies of the summer. Its widespread appeal is evident from the moment the film begins. The story is focused and engaging, making it enjoyable even for those who aren't die-hard DC fans.

Wonder woman is not a perfect movie, it's far from that, but it's a sigh of hope. Telling a story of origin, the film is a great flashback, and make it clear in the first scene, the script of the film is good, especially in the construction of the character and creation of the myth, but in the unfolding of history itself is diffuse. WONDERFUL, GOOD, PASSIVE, these are the 3 adjectives that we can use to describe each act of the film, with a very well built beginning, we have the presentation of the hero and the call to adventure, even if it follows a structure already known, the film is Great, with great scenes and a creation of the world, the Amazons are incredible, and the whole representation of their mythology also, in the second moment we have the acceptance of the adventure, the movie falls, but still good, passing in the first war more with taste Of cold war, we have fights veiled, great dialogues, a great team building, and even the great help of the wonder woman in the reconquest of a village (great sequence), the problems begin in the third act, where the film calls for a villain , Which appears out of nowhere (although the movie is all foreseeable), super forced and that badly helps in the character's progression, maybe if the film did not have a super powerful villain, just an analogy of the war in r To Ares, would be much more interesting, even because the wonder woman was not yet a ready heroine, but insist on putting the hero in the test of fire, do what n√© .... the end is disconnected with everything that until then came Being presented. The film seems to have been directed by zack Snyder (who despite the critics, I really like a lot of his filmography), we have his cameras used excessively in the slow motion mode, we have his photograph characteristically gray, the scenes of battles that seems to have His signature and even the clear evidence and affirmation that the hero is the hero, in spite of all this evidence, we know that the film was directed by the experienced in television but new in cinema patty jenkins, that sends well, and to notice that the fall Circumstantial in the film is more the script's fault than its direction. We can not fail to praise Gal Gado, who, although not having the best of dramatic charges, behaves well in all scenes of the film, especially in action. ""Wonder Woman"" is not a good thing, but it is a confirmation of what we already knew, DC knows how to make a hero movie!","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Solid entry in the DCEU and for female-led superhero movies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3741867/?ref_=tt_urv","TinseltownReviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur77838212/?ref_=tt_urv","29 June 2017","While not amazing by any means, Wonder Woman delivers its promise of a strong entry in the DCEU as well as the first truly good female superhero film.Gadot owns the role as Wonder Woman in the iconic character's first ever live-action adaptation on the big screen, breathing new life in the DCEU with a heroine that is radiant, uplifting, and relatable (a first for DCEU movies). Her performance as Diana Prince the character is very well done and her interpretation of Wonder Woman the warrior is excellent, the noticeably lacking some intensity in the final battle.Pine's Steve Trevor is a charming and charismatic English spy who has great chemistry with Gadot and gives an overall excellent performance, as does Robin Wright who plays Antiope, Diana's aunt. The rest of the cast give decent, but highly forgettable performances. Because so much of the film focuses on the core duo, characters like Etta Candy (Trevor's secretary as seen in all the trailers) and the three other members of Trevor's team do not get much focus.The villain is comparative to the subpar roster of MCU villains that can be summed up as ""fine, but forgettable,"" though there is a twist that is somewhat interesting. Ultimately though, nothing to write home about.The plot can be considered ""above average Marvel movie"", which is absolutely fine. It's better to have a simple and solid story rather than try too hard to have an overly complex one like previous DCEU films. The pacing of the movie can be compared to that of Rogue One. While the action scenes are better spread out and the movie has a riveting final thirty minutes, a decent portion of the middle is slow and boring. A bit too much time is spent with characters we don't care much about, leaving the movie a bit watered-down.Immediately noticeable is how saturated, bright, and colorful the film is compared to the previous doom and gloom DCEU movies. Themyscira is an absolutely gorgeous sight to behold and Wonder Woman's beautiful costume truly shines as one of the best looking live-action superhero costumes I've ever seen. The action scenes are fairly well filmed, though the frequent use of slow-motion can get a bit annoying at times.Read my full review at http://tinseltownreviews.blogspot.com/2017/06/wonder-woman-2017-new- hope-for-dceu-and.html","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

But if you are looking for something refreshing and different in the genre, this movie is not it and DC (and WB) seem to be very far from understanding the game that Disney is getting away with (even when their movies are not perfect, they are at least good enough in most cases).Unfortunately with the success of this, they basically are now showcasing wonder woman as the leader of the justice league at least until superman gets back, and even then she might be given a role that will attempt to steal the spotlight.All in all, this had potential, at least as a black horse of the genre, but the effort was so wasted in mediocre scenarios and lame execution that it just fell too short.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Gal Gadot has a notion about the environment that has to be used in this kind of movies. Nowadays DC movie saga has two movies of Wonder Woman. The first movie WAS released in movie theaters in 1974 and the last adaptation was made in 2017. The last is one of the movies with better quality where a woman is the star character.Gal Gadot developing her role as hero who previously and during the movie had trained Kung-fu, boxing, handling of swords and brazilian jiu-jitsu. Wonder Woman is called Diana and she lives in a island with just women all of them are called amazon. She has never gone away the island, aside her mother does not let her explore it. That island cannot be seen by anyone unless you be into. Diana is daughter of gods and her mother is the queen of the island.The environment of the movie is besieged on the First World War that happened in 1914 until 1918. Gal Gadot as Diana is what I like more cause the script that gave her fits her very well, It is worth mentioning that her skin and clothes make her look like a goddess of lightning. Wonder Woman always gets victorious, obviously not at first trying but with faculty and strength she wins. This is a movie that has been made to watch and watch again, simply one of the best actions movies I have seen.This is a fictional movie but also tackles real problems and real events that happened in the world, as I have said, but in this adaptation combining Wonder Woman with the First World War, one of the main problems in the movie is Ares, the demon who started the war and as Diana, he has special abilities. For all lovers of action movies and DC comics or movies, mainly women I totally recommend watching Wonder Woman.","4 out of 5 found this helpful.

It focuses on telling a story without trying to be edgy/trendy. It takes its time to develop Diana, as well as the world around her. As the film progresses, you see her grow into the character she was destined to be as she breaks past her naive perspective on how the world and the humans within it work, and it was nice to see a basic super hero flick with some depth. Most of the action sequences are polished and entertaining, but sometimes they bring a touch of reality to a scene, and play an integral part to her growth. Sadly the climax turns into the usual, with a villain encounter that undermines what the film was trying to accomplish with his cheesy performance and light show of a battle. There were also drawn out jokes and scenes that wasted precious screen time, but it manages to end strong despite, and I still say it's a step in the right direction for the genre. It's time for less trends, and more good story telling.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

It is not afraid to be cheesy so it came out as honest, for me it is the problem I have with superhero movies they want to get away from the good, selfless, noble hero because they are aparently 'cheesy' so superheros movies for me don't seem honest but parodies or so dark that they are depressing. This is what I want to see in a superhero movie, the scene of no man's land made me feel in a way that I have no words to define it... it was EPIC.But I think it's a shame that the end has broken the rhythm, I think Dr Maru is one of the most mysterious and interesting villains whose potential is wasted to make way for a plot twist and another of the final CGI battles that DC abuses.

The plot is the same as Captain America (stop the evil rouge German general from using the spooky weapon he's making in his secret lab), while the romance and humor are very similar to Thor (a man/woman from a mythical planet/island awkwardly interact with human society along side their romantic partners). The plot doesn't move quite smoothly, and it's often difficult to determine how characters got from point A to point B. The secondary characters are forgettable, as is the villain (the perennial problem with comic book movies it seems). Chris Pine and Gal Gadot have great chemistry, and the humor mostly works, being lighthearted without becoming unnecessarily goofy. The action scenes are too few, and lacking the intensity to create enough suspense, but it's still fun to see Wonder Woman kickass, especially with that lasso. I won't spoil the movie, but the ending is a letdown down, and quite inexplicable upon further reflection. That being said, the stunning Gal Gadot carries this movie, and her performance so encapsulates the intelligence, heroism and beauty of Wonder Woman, that it's enough to make the movie worth it.","8 out of 23 found this helpful.

Besides Carter is beautiful, Gadot is very unattractive. I suspect that those who exalt this film are feminists.And compared to the original movie, this one is badly directed. It lacks cohesiveness and credibility. It is as others have noted, a badly flawed flick. If you go to watch it, don't have high expectations because you will really be disappointed. The flick got a lot of undeserved praise.The only reason I went to see this flick was to take my 14 yr. old granddaughter and my 17 yr. old grandson. My granddaughter loved the movie, my grandson was bored by it, thought it was a waste of time. But I can understand why anyone who is still a juvenile at heart might enjoy this fantasy. Also, why viewers who were not old enough to watch the original Wonder Woman had nothing to compare the latest flick with the original. It is like the James Bond movies. The original Sean Connery versions were by far the best but as the movies went on and new actors became James Bond, they couldn't match Sean Connery. Likewise Gadot is no Lynda Carter. And I don't mean to compare the James Bond movies with the DC movies because the DC movies including the latest Wonder Woman are not even close to being in the same class as the James Bond movies. It is like comparing the Untouchables with the Brahmans.Another thing that one has to wonder. Wonder Woman was not released until June 2, yet there were so many reviews written prior to that date. So is someone stacking the deck in order to get people to watch the flick?","61 out of 130 found this helpful.

"","","the best entry in the DCEU cinematic universe so far","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3741859/?ref_=tt_urv","milk-carton-reviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur75357351/?ref_=tt_urv","29 June 2017","While not a perfect movie, ""Wonder Woman"" is definitely good and by far the best movie of the DCEU. After the likes of ""Batman v Superman"" and ""Suicide Squad"", my bar was set pretty low for this movie, and I'm glad to say that it exceeded my expectations. The beginning starts off a bit weak and exposition-heavy, which was slightly off-putting but still enjoyable enough. However, the second that Steve (Chris Pine) and Diana leave her island, the movie takes a turn for the better. It was refreshing to see that the two love interests in a superhero movie actually had chemistry for a change, and watching them interacting and learning things from each other was just a delight. Without a doubt, the middle was the strongest part of the movie, and the most enjoyable aspect was Diana and Steve's relationship, partly because of the script, but mostly because of the performances by Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. Speaking of Chris Pine, his character actually serves a purpose in the movie and works perfectly next to Diana. Both characters learn from the relationship and grow as people, Diana learning about the realism of the world from Steve, and Steve learning something from Diana's childish optimism, and that there is always something to believe in. Gal Gadot was a delight in the role of Wonder Woman. I was slightly worried while watching ""Batman v Superman"" because I thought she would play a bland and boring version of the character, but this movie just shoved that fear aside. Her line delivery at times could have been better, but it was the emotional lines that counted, and boy, does she know how to deliver a blow. Aside from that, the movie also raises a few interesting points about war and the goodness of men. It forces you to see war from the perspective of someone who never witnessed anything like that before, and who is genuinely baffled by this war and why anybody would choose to start something like it. All of this is brought up in some very powerful scenes, and the goodness of Diana can actually move you, separating her from some other ""purely good"" characters we've seen before, such as Superman and Captain America. Now on to the negatives. Most of the problems with this movie come with the villains and the obvious meddling of the studio. Let's talk about the villains first. There's two major villains in the real world - Dr Poison and a German general (I believe), but there's also obviously Ares, whom Diana is set on finding because she believes it will end the war if she kills him. The two ""real world"" villains were pretty generic and over the top, with unclear motivations and just completely forgettable. Without spoiling anything, ""Ares"" is not much better. There was a clear point in the movie where I thought ""Okay, this is beautiful, I hope they stop right here and end on a quiet, but enlightening note"", but they just HAD to shove in a major, over-blown CGI battle at the end, which I thought was completely unnecessary. It completely ruined the point that the movie was trying to raise, and if the ending was different, I would have given this movie a higher rating. Also, a minor thing that sort of bugged me (I know it bothered some people more, it was just a minor thing for me, though), is the excessive use of slow motion. I'm not really a fan of Zack Snyder, and as we all know, he really does go overboard with the slow motion. And yes, I know that the movie was directed by Patty Jenkins, and not Zack Snyder, but he was involved with the film and clearly had a role in it. All in all, this movie was definitely better than what I had expected, I'm just slightly disappointed that it went the traditional superhero route by the end when it could have been so much more, but otherwise, I think it's a great, fun movie that DC fans are going to love.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

That is one of the few good things I can say about the movie. To me it is quite shocking that most people don't see the heavy propaganda in this movie. Really, it is a pity as the movie could have become a quite good anti-war movie. Instead they decide that Wonder Woman takes side with the allied forces and they do very little to show how both sides were slaughtering their own people for their imperial demands. Why do they show only the Germans to use poison gas? Churchill had no problem using poison gas against civilists as he stated 1919: ""I am strongly in favour of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes"" Why don't they show the British empire enslave the people of their colonies? Why don't they show the peace movement in all countries over the world? Why doesn't wonder woman join THEM instead of one of the obviously equally evil fighting forces? They could have shown the revolutions in all over europe that actually did a lot to end the war. Instead they make a propaganda flick for a ""humanitarian"" war.A pity.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

"9","/10","You'll be seeing lots of colorful wonders when you're with this Wonder Woman","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3723605/?ref_=tt_urv","terrellrobinson71","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22782552/?ref_=tt_urv","4 June 2017","For the past 76 years, Wonder Woman has been such an iconic female character in the DC universe. She always proves that if men (superheroes included) can fight against the darkness, the women can do it too. With her sword, shield and Lasso of Truth, she fights for what she believes in and is always there to help those who are weak. Now the time has come for Wonder Woman to make her way to the big screen for the first time ever and the results are phenomenal. And if you remember Lynda Carter stepping into that costume and saving the day in the classic '70s show, then you will definitely remember Isreali sweetheart Gal Gadot as the feisty, tough and big-hearted superheroine. After her scene-stealing debut performance as the Amazonian princess in the flawed, but totally entertaining ""Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice"", I say it's about time that a female superhero gets her chance to shine in her own film. After a year in waiting for this movie to come out, I can say this with a happy heart, this movie is the ride that definitely lives up to the hype. Deftly directed by Patty Jenkins, who gave Charlize Theron an unforgettable performance--and an Oscar---as the serial killer Aileen Wuornos in ""Monster"", ""Wonder Woman"" embraces its origin story with enough humor, heart and stunningly choreographed action sequences that it never drags or sags, it just comes alive in a real colorful way. Born in the all-female island of Themyscira, Diana (Gadot), daughter of Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), has always wanted to be a warrior just like her mother and her aunt Antiope (Robin Wright). In the years that followed, Diana has been training and preparing for action, but discovers that she has powers that are astonishing. Next thing we know, a young soldier named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) lands on the island and Diana is exposed to a more darker side of human nature where bullets are ripping out of their guns and lives are lost. Steve manages to warn these ladies that war is coming (the World War, in fact) with highly impossibly created weapons invented by Doctor Poison (Elena Anaya) and General Lundendorff (Danny Huston). So Diana leaves her paradise home and travels to London with Steve to fight and to find the one God that actually caused it (I think you know what I am talking about). Part of the fun and heart of this movie is watching Diana exploring and learning about the good and dark side of life. As war causes pain, casualties, and emotions, they can sometimes bring us hope that the world can change, even if it's not as better as one would expect. Along the way, Diana and Steve got the help they need in some unlikely characters including Steve's smart assistant Etta Candy (Lucy Davis), a Scottish sharpshooter named Charlie (Ewen Bremmer) who is struggling with PTSD and a master of disguise named Sameer (Said Taghmaoui) as they fight their way into enemy territory with lots of surprises left in store for them. After the superb ""Man of Steel"", and the flawed, but somewhat good ""BVS"" and ""Suicide Squad"", ""Wonder Woman"" is the DC film I've been waiting for. Here is a rousing, colorful and heartfelt adventure that has big laughs, cool action, characters that you can actually root for and a climax that may be as typical as one might expect from a superhero movie, but it's filled with more emotional power that some might not see coming. The cast that Jenkins has managed to put together, including the awesome David Thewlis in a pivotal role you have to witness for yourself, is amazing. I've always been a fan of Chris Pine's work, following his best performances in the brilliant ""Hell or High Water"" and the ""Star Trek"" films. The cocky demeanor that he brings to Captain Kirk is actually quite useful in the role of Steve Trevor and he has an real undeniable chemistry with Gadot. Plus, the screenplay by Allan Heinberg gives us dialogue that crackles with sly humor (Most of the hearty laughs comes from Sameer, Etta and of course, Diana & Steve) and a lot of exposition that creates a more streamlined plot that is more reserved for a film like this. To end this review, let me say something about Gal Gadot. It's not easy to fill the shoes of Wonder Woman that was once inhabited by Lynda Carter. But she makes it look effortless and puts a lot of hard work into the character. She gives such a remarkable and endearing performance as Wonder Woman and I think this is the one that might actually make her a big star and the character that I can't wait to see again. She's wonderful. So is the movie.","15 out of 27 found this helpful.

There are good touches of humor here without making it too corny (Marvel is an expert at the corny humor).2. The romance. I appreciated that there was some of that in here and the relationship with Steve Trevor is what shaped Wonder Woman.3. The action. I am not going to lie, Wonder Woman kicks butt. Overall, this is a good movie. The editing is also not all over the place, which is a problem for all of the other DCEU movies. If I had to rank this movie, I would say it ranks like this for me:Man of Steel Wonder Woman Batman V.

I had my exam yesterday but I was more worried about making it to the theater on time. I finished the exam within an hour and 15 minutes and rushed to the IMAX. I was not disappointed. I cleared the exam and the movie was good.Wonder Women is the best DCEU movie till date.It hooks you right from the beginning. You see the beautiful world of Themyscira and want to join the beautiful ladies in their quest. The CGI sequence telling the story of Zeus and Ares is brilliantly done. I hate Slow-Mo but Wonder Woman used it in a good way. It was a thrilling experience to watch it on an IMAX screen. It made me wonder if I was really watching a DC film. It did not feel like a DC film at all.Most of the DCEU movies have suffered from the same problem. They take things too seriously. I mean, I love Batman and I love the dark atmosphere they create in those films but what's the problem with one or two good jokes? Most of their films maintain the same dark tone throughout the run-time. When they decided to go the Marvel in Suicide Squad, it turned out to be a big turd. Fortunately, Wonder Woman does not suffer from the same problem. It works on multiple levels. It has got style with substance. It has got action and emotions. It has a got a good foundation, over which multiple layers are placed beautifully. There is character development and you get to see how Wonder Woman becomes Wonder Woman. Now, this may sound like I am exaggerating but DC has disappointed me so much in the past that WoW feels like a breath of fresh air.Acting wise, Chris Pine was brilliant but it is Gal Gadot who stole the show. She was made for this role. Her transformation throughout the film is brilliant. To be honest, watching her kicking some butt on the big screen was worth the money and wait.It isn't without faults though. The biggest problem with the film is the climax; I saw it coming from a mile away. Also, the ending is a bit too much CGI and made me feel like I was watching a Michael Bay or Snyder film, which kind of ruins an otherwise amazing experience.So Wonder Woman is a good film and I would suggest you watch it on the big screen. With this film, DC has finally understood what they need to do in order to make a good film. It has given them a much-needed start. I just hope they don't mess it up in future. Now, I am excited for Justice League.","15 out of 27 found this helpful.

The British supporting cast add a deeper flair to the proceedings, with Lucy Davis and David Thewlis offering smart performances. Gal Gadot channels a mixture of innocence, strength, wisdom and humour which reminded me of Christopher Reeve in Superman (1978). The script gives her performance a spirit and urgency which the origin story frame allows to flourish. Chris Pine is equally fine, balancing a challenging mixture of humility and bravado that gives the film a distinct edge.The parallels with Superman (1978) are particularly apt. Both films kick-started modern takes on legendary figures with colourful, exciting adaptations of origin stories. The actions sequences are intense, clever and filled with emotional resonance.","24 out of 47 found this helpful.

Of course, we've seen WW before in ""Batman vs Superman: Dawn Of Justice"" and we'll see her again soon in the forthcoming ""Justice League"". What works so well with this movie is that it is an origin story that stands alone and does not require the audience to have any familiarity with other super-heroes which enables it to reach out to a new (especially female) audience.The narrative is straightforward, starting on the well-realised Amazonian island of Themyscira and then moving, via 1918 London, onto a blood-splattered battlefield at the conclusion of the First World War. There are effective action sequences but also some nice humorous touches in a work that does not take itself too seriously and delivers handsomely on the entertainment front. Chris Pine is ideal as the good-looking American who leads Diana from one world to the other and introduces her to the best and the worst of humankind, while David Thewlis is interesting casting for a vital dual role. The flaws in the film include the easy defeat of the main villain (after all, he is a god) and an excessive running time and some feminists will criticise the portrayal of the titular heroine, but overall the work is a major success that deservedly will do well at the box office.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Finally after so many years, Wonder Woman has her own movie and Gal Gadot magnificently does well in the titular role.Wonder Woman starts off by exploring the origins of Diana Prince being born and raised on the island of Themyscira being raised by her mother Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) and later undergoing secret training by her Aunty General Antiope (Robin Wright) to become an Amazon Warrior to which Hippolyta forbids at first but later relents. Things change when Diana rescues pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) after he crashes off the coast of Themyscira while trying to escape from the German military. Steve reveals that he is actually a spy and has uncovered a sinister plot by General Erich Ludendorff (Danny Huston) and his chief chemist known as Dr. Poison (Elena Anaya) to develop a bioweapon that is deadlier than mustard gas. Steve wants to put a stop to the deadly bioweapon and Diana, believing that Ares is behind World War I, wants to help Steve.Gal Gadot is a welcome addition to the DC superhero franchise and deserves a well earned spot as one of the best superhero portrayals as Wonder Woman. Not sure what Wonder Woman would have turned out to be like had the plans for a movie came to fruition in the late 1990's and in 2009 with Megan Gale almost earning herself the role however the movie never eventuated.Chris Pine who is frequently cast in leading man roles does well taking a step back and playing second fiddle as Steve Trevor to Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman. He is not a wimp nor is he relying on Wonder Woman all the time, but still wants to prove he can hold his own and lead the charge to prevent the German's deadly plot. The rest of the supporting cast including Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, Danny Huston (a quality villain), Said Taghmaoui and Ewen Bremner (can't do any wrong) also do well in their respective roles.Director Patty Jenkins does a terrific job bringing Wonder Woman to life. Well known for the crime drama Monster (2003) which netted Charlize Theron an Academy Award for Best Actress, Patty Jenkins also earns the distinction of being the first woman to direct a superhero movie.The only downside is that it could have done with more action and less time on the backstory. That being said, the movie was far from dull.After seeing the various trailer of Wonder Woman beforehand, it certainly lived up to the hype. The movie was definitely well worth the experience and I left the cinema very content and fulfilled. Wonder Woman has deserved its popularity with critics and audiences alike, and it looks like it will be one of the most popular movies of 2017. Audiences are sure to see more of Wonder Woman pop up in Justice League in November 2017 and any future sequels down the track. 7/10.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

Her mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), is hesitant/hiding something from her, but eventually allows her sister/Diana's aunt, Antiope (Robin Wright), to train her to be better than the rest of the Amazons. She proves herself to be just that and so much more. After Diana rescues Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), whose crashed plane from World War I penetrated Themyscira's shield/cloak, their two worlds collide. Once Steve's subjected to the Lasso of Truth (Pine's equal parts amusing/utterly believable when under its influence), Diana's convinced the Amazons' old enemy, Ares the God of War, is behind 'the war' Steve speaks of and is determined to help the world of man.Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman was the stand-out in BvS, and proves the skeptics incorrect about that simply being a 'fluke' due to her limited screen-time. This movie rests on her shoulders, and Gadot proves more than up to the task of portraying Diana as brave/courageous/intelligent/'badass' and, most of all, deeply empathetic/compassionate (not just regarding people, but animals too). She radiates warmth and her performance is, at times, heartbreaking (especially during the really emotional scenes). Gadot also has good comedic timing/delivery of lines (like when she discovers ice cream) and is just so likable, endearingly earnest, but genuine. Everything a hero *should* be (unlike other certain so-called 'superheroes').Pine's Steve is far more likable than his Kirk. He does a lot with what could've been a thankless role and, like Diana, Steve proves himself a hero. He helps Diana adjust to being in a new world, teaching/explaining things to her, but is never condescending. Both actors 'click', especially in the boat scene when leaving Themyscira. They have an easy chemistry; their banter is fun and Steve/Diana's respective fish-out-of-water scenarios allow for some amusing moments without verging into silliness. They respect each other, neither one is ever portrayed 'negatively' to 'prop up' the other (even when they argue), and it's one of the only comic book movie romantic pairings (that's been developed over the course of just one movie) which I've found truly believable/has actually had any emotional impact.Steve's secretary, Etta Candy, also provides some humour, though thankfully isn't too annoying. She takes an instant liking to Diana (you can see why) and Diana respects her in return. See, other comic cook movies? Mutual respect between characters isn't THAT hard! Steve's other trusted reinforcements only get small amounts of screen-time, but each feel like fully-developed/proper characters with depth/flaws. The camaraderie that forms between them and Diana is earned/believable, bringing real 'heart' to the story.On the villains' side there's Danny Huston's Ludendorff, who Diana believes to be Ares, thus providing Diana with an adversary she can beat up/someone you really want to see her kick the arse of. Even better, though, is Elena Anaya as Doctor Maru aka 'Doctor Poison' (she and Ludendorff make a truly twisted pair, with a sick sense of humour that at least makes them more memorable than the typical comic book villains). I've been impressed with Anaya's previous work, and she conveys so much whilst acting with half her face behind a mask. In a scene she shared with Steve, I even felt for her (Pine does well here too). I appreciated the moment between her character and Diana near the end, and that it didn't go quite the way one might've expected.While the Amazons are only in the beginning of the movie, they still make a strong impression. Witnessing them in action is quite something to behold. Despite Hippolyta and Diana often disagreeing/arguing with each other, Gal Gadot and Connie Nielsen completely sell the love their characters feel for each other (as well as ALL the Amazons). At first David Thewlis feels underutilized as Sir Patrick, who helps Diana/Steve, but later on shares a scene with Diana through a window that I thought was visually interesting.The music throughout the film packs an emotional punch, and those complaining about 'overuse' of the awesomely memorable 'Wonder Woman Theme' (which we got a taste of in BvS and this film's trailers) need to hush, as it's only used sparingly/at the RIGHT times, mostly during the epic fight scenes (proving almost as 'iconic' as the 'Superman Theme'). Speaking of, this movie gives us something *different* with the hero's style of fighting. Her use of sword, shield, bullet-deflecting bracelets, as well as the Lasso of Truth, makes for some stunning/inventive action sequences.Regarding complaints of 'too much CGI' during the climax, given who was fighting who and the power at their disposal, the effects on display were justified. The Wonder Woman costume doesn't get enough credit for being true to the comic whilst also being functional/non-gratuitous/non-exploitative (no star-spangled panties here). The first time she shows it off in the 'No Man's Land' sequence is very memorable. Not only is it one of the movie's best scenes, but it also deserves to be right up there alongside the first time Superman saves Lois as far as immediately 'iconic' (there's that word again) sequences go. Diana's other costumes are also gorgeous, as is Themyscira ('Paradise Island' indeed). The film feels like a classic action/adventure movie. It's well-paced, has plenty of heart, and is indeed one of the best comic book movies in LONG time.Naturally, it'll have its detractors/nitpickers, but this is one movie where the hype is warranted/to be believed. It's everything I've been waiting for/wanting to see in a superhero movie for so long. This isn't just easily the best DCEU movie so far, nor is it simply an excellent superhero movie, it's also a triumph for the first big screen adaptation of Wonder Woman and an enthralling cinema-going experience/one of the best movies in recent memory. Everyone involved with this film should feel proud/pat themselves on the back for this accomplishment.","26 out of 52 found this helpful.

Let me just get this out of the way. I love both Marvel and DC. I want them all to be good, but if I'm being honest, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad are complete misfires. They're both messy, mishandled, with a lot of corporate meddling. However, Wonder Woman is the complete opposite. This marks a second great DC film for WB in my books(I know there are people who love/hate Man of Steel, but I happened to really like it). Princess Diana, otherwise known as Wonder Woman here is fully realized and completely three-dimensional. She finally gets her due in cinema and I cannot be more pleased. She's idealistic yet naive, compassionate, yet stubborn, and brave. I typically dislike origin stories, but every now and then they can be very fun, and Wonder Woman is that exception. Patty Jenkins who led Charlize Theron to an Oscar, brings a story that is packed with heart without ever getting too over the top or too heavy handed. During the hype train I disliked the idea of Gal Gadot, mainly due to her inexperience as an actor. She slightly won me over for the short amount of time she was in Batman v Superman, but now she really won me over. I will admit, there are moments where she didn't exactly deliver her lines effectively, but I think the more she plays this character the more better she'll be. Chris Pine is great in the role of Steve Trevor. Again, while I thought some of Gadot's delivery felt dry or cheesy, she and Pine do have a great chemistry. I always preach about this, and even if it sounds like overkill at this point, but chemistry is so important with anything that has to do with romance. The romance here is solid and believable. In a very good way it was very reminiscent of Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter. The supporting cast are solid, highlights include Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright portray Queen Hippolyta and General Antiope, and they're not characters who get the short end of the stick, they actually contribute to Diana's upbringing. The supporting cast is good too. Pine's Trevor recruits a ragtag team, again reminiscent of The Howling Commandos in Captain America: The First Avenger. Taking a page off Marvel though, the villains are the ones who do end up getting the short end of the stick. There is a twist I didn't see coming, but even then it was a bit excessive and kind of out of place. I will say though, I happened to enjoy only Elena Anaya's creepy Doctor Poison out of the film's villains. The third act is slightly underwhelming, but the action scenes are fantastic. I was quite surprised as I was concerned about Patty Jenkins' ability to shoot action. Also they're lit in daylight and being able to see everything unfold is just pure eye-candy. Something I appreciated is that Jenkins also shows the casualty of what war brings and she doesn't compromise on the gruesome reality of it. Visual effects are good, but there are few moments where its so obvious that it's cgi. I'm not very picky in that department, but when it's too too noticeable, then it automatically takes me out of the film.I did mention Captain America: The First Avenger multiple times, and the film takes some influences and operates like it, but it's not a carbon copy at all. On the surface Wonder Woman might appear to be of similar adventures and superhero films that we've seen on screen, but it's moving parts and the little things it does that makes the film shine. With good character moments, humorous banter, and a resonating romance, it is the female superhero film that we needed. 8.5/10","26 out of 52 found this helpful.

The story follows Diana, a young princess of the Amazonian women of Themyscira. Diana grows into a strong and formidable warrior and is eventually introduced to the outside world when a pilot from the Great War crashes near Themyscira. The Amazonian princess saves the man's life and is soon swept up in the conflicts of the outside world.Wonder Woman is a fun and action-packed film. The battle scenes are fantastic and there are a few genuinely funny moments. Incredibly moving at times, Wonder Woman is a great superheroine film.If there are any critiques of the film that could be made, it is probably the few jokes that don't work. They are cringe-inducing, but thankfully, those moments are few and far between. Another point to be made is that most superhero movies, especially origin stories, must always deal with the reactions of normal people to the super- human abilities of the hero. This film glosses over this detail and no one is particularly amazed at Diana's powers. However, these are minor critiques.Overall, Wonder Woman is a great film. Nearly all audiences will find something to enjoy in this movie. Fans of the comic books are especially in for a treat. While no extreme changes are made from the newer source material, fans will be very happy to see their favorite heroine done well in a good movie.","13 out of 23 found this helpful.

Not to mention my girlfriend wanted to see it, and there's not many she actually wants to see.I doubt you can imagine the level of disappointment I felt by the time it was over. And I honestly have no idea why so many people think it's so amazing.WWI was a huge tragedy, but the first war that was very well documented. And I would have thought that if they had picked that for a setting, that there could have been some semblance of realism somewhere. Not to mention some way of involving her in events that actually, or at least, might have happened. So maybe that's nitpicking. But from start to finish, the plot in general had holes big enough to drive a warship through.I can't really comment on the acting as the script was so bad I don't think anyone could have saved it.It would have also helped if it would have had a great, or even good antagonist. But the villains here got so little screen time, they never felt even a little threatening.A good supporting cast could have made it better as well. But they too seemed to get no character development, and didn't seem to have too much of a reason to even be there, aside from the odd bit of comic relief and to remind us of how gorgeous Wonder Woman is.Technically, there was nothing special about it. The CGI was nothing special and the editing left me wondering how much had been cut out.On the plus side, and maybe the only positive about the whole movie, was that Gal Gadot looked great as Wonder Woman. But really, the only reason I can think of for all the glowing reviews, is that people love watching a hot woman kicking ass and taking names (and she didn't actually take that many names...but she did kick a lot of ass though)And in case you're curious, my girlfriend liked it a whole lot less than me.","94 out of 212 found this helpful.

Raised on the island paradise of Themyscira and trained as an Amazon warrior, Diana's world is forever changed when American pilot, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), crash lands on the island's shores. Learning from Steve about World War I (which they call the war to end all wars), Diana leaves her home in hopes of bringing the conflict to an end. Following DC's previous mediocre superhero films, Wonder Woman is a vast improvement. Not only is the film's action stunning and gorgeous eye candy, but it also has a strong, cohesive plot line that audiences can get invested in. The biggest praise, however, has to go to Gal Godot and Chris Pine for their respective performances. Diana is a hopeful hero, not one to angst or brood like some other superheroes. While she is a more than capable fighter, in this film she is shown to be quite na√Øve about the workings of the world. This pairs nicely with Steve Trevor, who, while a charming character, is more cynical about the world than Diana. He can also handle himself in a fight and is not in the film simply as someone for Diana to save. In fact, they often help one another out. The film also knows when to slow down from the action and focus on moments between characters, which give the film a more emotional depth. Now, admittedly the film's German antagonists are a tad one-dimensional, being the stereotypical German villains that are evil purely for the sake of being evil. However, this hardly hampers the film's enjoyment. Overall, this is the best film in DC's cinematic line-up so far. It is worthy of the praise and worthy of seeing in cinemas.","12 out of 21 found this helpful.

With the 2016 arrivals of Batman V Superman and the atrocious Suicide Squad, expectations were tempered with this film and rightfully so. Batman V Superman may have redeemed itself with a self-indulgent but much needed director's cut and Suicide Squad...well, yeah-that just was terrible so any pessimistic antics regarding this film are sort of justified given the track record thus far. Well, I can say without a doubt in my mind, this is one seriously cool film. Directed by Patty Jenkins and also stars Chris Pine, Danny Huston and Robin Wright, Wonder Woman is the DCEU's Marvel equivalent to Thor and it is just as good, if not, better. First off, the film is very informative even to a layman. It doesn't treat things as common knowledge but it doesn't hold your hand either. This is a smart movie when it comes down to it because it doesn't rush anything. Everything in the film flows naturally, it doesn't feel like these characters are boring or that the story is not engaging. The pacing is very well set and for a film that is pushing 150 minutes, that's impressive. The acting is also surprisingly great. Gal Gadot as Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman is probably the most perfect casting in cinema history. Gadot is fierce, brave and absolutely stunning in her portrayal. It reminded me a lot of Christopher Reeve when he was Superman. The supporting cast lead by Chris Pine is also great. Pine is proving himself to be one great actor. With last year's Hell or High Water and now this, Pine is slowly proving what it means to be a movie star. Another stand out in the film is Danny Huston who seems to relish in villainous roles. Huston is really great here and I'm hoping he gets the credit he deserves. While there is much to praise with this film, there is also so issues I had with it as well. Many people were actually comparing this film to The Dark Knight at my screening. As much as I did like this film, I am also here to say: No. Not even close.The issues I had with the film were more so directed in the way of the script. While I thought the pacing was great in the film, I thought some of the dialog was horrendous and cheesy. The film does escape and shed some of the very things that landed DC in hot water but it also can't seem to escape one very damaging part of DC: bad dialog. While I am sure that many people are not going to care about a misplaced line or two in between Wonder Woman kicking butt and taking names during trench warfare, it does become a bit of distraction during the less exciting moments. The moments between Pine and Gadot are very melodramatic and feel more like a soap opera at times. Many people will like it, I personally thought the cheeky stuff was more so thrown into the film rather than feeling natural.Overall, Wonder Woman is a great addition to the superhero genre. It has heart, it is lighter than other DC films but also has the edge it needed to be a cut above the rest. Fans of Wonder Woman comics should be pleased and tickled pink by this lovely film adaptation and those of you who were skeptical can breathe a sigh if relief because this movie is definitely worth the price of admission.","10 out of 32 found this helpful.

Something that comics (DC in this case) expressed in comic books and now have adapted to the big screen (minus the 60's television series and previous adaptations).Wonder Woman tends to be more action packed at times while carrying to the original idea on how Wonder Woman came to be. Some crude humor made its way into the movie early on then hits you with a dose of sequences full of action and explosions.For me it was worth watching but I'll probably wait till DC studios comes out with Justice League sometime soon.","12 out of 21 found this helpful.

After I came out of the theatre I couldn't understand what all the fuzz is about. The movie is just OK. I think it is closer to being bad than good.The acting is good. Most of the actors do a very good job in portraying their characters. The only two actors who I believe were miscast were Robin Wright and David Thewlis as Sir Patrick.Robin Wright just looked ridiculous dressed like that and doing ""stunts"" ( or better yet a CGI version of her). And David just made me feel sad for him, he was terribly miscast and his character was laughably bad.The action scenes in the movie are mediocre. They are full of pretty bad CGI and slo-mo ""money shots"" (trying to look like 300). It was very sad to see how they have an actress like Gal Gadot that is an army veteran and knows how to fight, being replaced by a bad CGI version of her.I must admit, there are some parts in the action scenes that were pretty cool, specially a fight in London.The first half of the film is pretty slow and had me pretty bored, it was really boring to see all the exposition and the Amazonian world. Actually, I was looking at my watch for whole run-time of the film.The relationship between the characters was good enough and believable. But there was a big problem, the movie failed in making me care for any character except Wonder Woman. When a character died, I really didn't care about it. I will give it this, I was glad someone died in a superhero movie.The ending was terrible though. It was a CGI culsterf*ck that reminded me of BvS. It was really unexciting and completely ruined the message of the film. And the final shot... it was so cringeworthy.I did enjoyed the ""feminist"" aspect of the film. I was expecting this movie to have extreme feminism and make all the male characters stupid or assh*les while the female characters are perfect. But the movie actually makes both male and female characters relatable and competent.In the end, this movie was just mediocre. It is nothing impressive and i wouldn't pay a ticket to watch it.","7 out of 21 found this helpful.

It has been such a long time since we had a truly optimistic, heartfelt, and passionate superhero film. It seems you either have to be super edgy (DC's BvS and Suicide Squad), or super goofy/sarcastic (Marvel Movies)... but Wonder Woman has found a way to navigate those awful waters and find what makes superhero films so great - the same way Richard Donner did with ""Superman"" 1978. So don't bother listening to haters - this film is a once in a generation flick, that resurrects the feeling of joy and optimism at the idea that there are ""superhumans"" and ""superheroes"" out there saving the day.

That's the way to do it. Each genre has its rules and one needs to know a minimum of them before entering the cinema theater or starting to see a movie on TV or on his/her preferred viewing device. When I chose to see a super-heroes comics inspired movie I do not expect a lot of realism or credibility from the story, and these are not the films where I am looking for lessons about life. On the other hand I am ready for fun entertainment, for action and special effects, I hope to see a coherent story with actors performances that make me care about the characters. I do not care about the laws of physics, but I hope there will be some humor and that the good guys will eventually prevail.Many of the super-heroes movies nowadays do actually carry some cultural background, it's just a different type of culture, and it helps, although it is not mandatory, to know it. 'Wonder Woman' is a character that combines the mythology of comics stories with the other mythology, the ancient Greek one, the one we read about and maybe learned about in school. Invented during WWII, at a time when women were playing an increasing role in supporting the war effort, mostly by undertaking the roles played in economy by the men sent to fight, but not on the first line of the front, the character of princess Diana (yes, this is the name of the character) carries a strong feminist message. The authors of the script and director Patty Jenkins moved the origins of the story to the end of WWI, the war that was supposed to end all wars. By the way, hard to believe that this talented director is at her only second film, and that 14 years passed since her remarkable debut with Monster. They brought the princess from her isolated island somehow hidden in the mist of mythology, in a tentative to really end all wars. We all know that the tentative failed. In the process the hero will learn a few things about men and evils of mankind, will avoid and block a whole arsenal of bullets and bombs and will kick many bad guys to dust.I enjoyed 'Wonder Woman' because of a few good reasons. The feminism of the message is never dogmatic and almost always impregnated with a dose of self-irony. Gal Gadot who plays the lead role may not be a great actress, but she has the looks, is very well fit physically and typologically for the role. The film is very much the story of her coming to age while learning to understand mankind and fighting on the side of the good guys. She does it with the smile of a teenager on her face and radiates optimism and belief in truth which somehow becomes credible and succeeds to overcome the horrors of the carnage fields of the world war we see on screen. While playing well on the mythology grounds, the story has enough humor to avoid being dry or pathetic and lets us understand we are still in fantasy land. I also liked the special effects, especially in the opening scenes when the Amazons fight the uneven battle with the war machines created by men since they were lost in history. The color palette of the cinematography was well adapted to the different phases of the story, although the 3D spectacles made it (again) too dark - there is something that needs improvement in the technology here. I also liked two of the supporting actors - Chris Pine who succeeded to be the nice guy without being over-sweet (also because of the dose of humor invested in his role), and especially David Thewlis which I have seen previously in Fargo and who develops to be a formidable actor. I liked less the other characters, especially the bad guys, who were, well ... cartoonish. The end of the story was a little disappointing. It looked like one of these epic superheroes endings, but the careful preparation and building that preceded prepared me for something better. It leaves however clearly the path open for the sequels and I will be making reservations when pre-sales tickets become available.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Yeah, there were problems with the plot, and the acting could have been better, but my biggest problem with the film was the lack of character development and the historical inaccuracies. The vehicles (motorcycle especially) and aircraft, clothing, speech, everything - wouldn't even have passed muster for a WW II film, let alone one set in WW I.From the previews I had high hopes for this movie, and I really liked Gal Gadot as WW, but the movie overall was just 'meh'. I watched it and actually made it through to the end (unlike a few other reviewers) but I did find myself glancing at my watch more often than usual.So yeah, there have been better superhero movies, but there have sure been worse ones, too.

Great historical weakness there as there were huge differences between the First and Second World Wars.","17 out of 32 found this helpful.

Created for the purpose of ""fighting using love"", Wonder Woman had always been a interesting character to include in stories, but hard to pinpoint when it came to personality. After the last 3 DC movies I said no more for me. I'm glad a friend changed my mind on that. I didn't go to see it because it was the next chapter in a cinematic universe, I saw it because it told a story (and the hype behind all the critic reviews, of course). And there's a perfect balance to her: she's not sexual used by virtue of her appearance, and she's not a feminist. She's just a woman, who shows vulnerability, and wants there to be world peace. I was so surprised by how much they humanized her. Inspite of the fact that she was a stonehard killer, she looked at the world mostly through the eyes of a little girl. And I never expected that. I didn't just like it because it was a great movie, I also liked it because this is the best incarnation of Wonder Woman I've ever seen, even compared to the animated features. If you want a movie with great world history, a little bit of mythology, and an awesome ""new"" superhero the center of it all, I'd recommend checking this one out. This took decades to get to, and even Joss Whedon admitted it was too complicated for him to make. Don't watch this because of the Cinematic Universe, watch it because it's a good movie with (finally) a well-made message behind it.","24 out of 48 found this helpful.

It doesn't hold back, it pulls out all the stops, it doesn't reserve some parts for a potential sequel, it fully gives you this iconic Amazonian Warrior princess in all her glory. You'll be constantly blown away by what she can do because the film is constantly eager to show them to you. Gal Gadot has cemented her star power and the DC Cinematic Universe has redeemed themselves through ""Wonder Woman.""Starring Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, Robin Wright, Connie Nielsen, David Thewlis, directed by Patty Jenkins, before she was Wonder Woman, she was Diana, princess of the Amazons trained to be an unconquerable warrior in the mythical island of Themyscira. But Diana is unaware of her true identity. When an American pilot crashes on their shores and tells of a massive war raging in the outside world, Diana feels compelled to join him and fight alongside mankind to stop the threat and kill who she blames to be the cause of such destruction, the god of war Ares.Because it's a DC movie, much of the visual and the style of ""Wonder Woman"" is what you'd expect from a DC movie. But what's great about this one, which by the way the other installments unfortunately failed to do, is that ""Wonder Woman"" manages to inject entertainment, so it's not all brooding and dark and depressing like the way they've turned boyscout Superman into.And I think much of that is thanks to the fish-out-of-water aspect. This is a woman who comes from a place which has a significantly different culture than ours. And halfway through the end, the fish-out-of-water aspect becomes less about literally not fitting in and more about her misunderstood perception of us, mankind. So perhaps ""Wonder Woman"" is an example of a success story that happens when you don't give all the control to Zack Snyder and when studio heads don't meddle with the mythology and the filmmaker's vision and when things are not forced or rushed. The result is a story which you can tell has been given a considerable amount of thought process.Any doubt anybody may have had about Gal Gadot playing this role will fade away the minute she steps into the screen. Not only does she look the part, she's absolutely gorgeous, her acting is sharp, she also performs the action sequences with strength and elegance. She becomes Wonder Woman, they are now inseparable, just like we're all going to have a hard time imagining somebody else other than Hugh Jackman as Wolverine/Logan. This is Wonder Woman's debut on the big screen, billions of girls and women on earth look up to her as their hero, they have been anticipating this moment for years, so it is a huge responsibility, one that I think Gadot gracefully carries. Kudos to WB and DC Entertainment for entrusting this to female filmmaker Patty Jenkins who does an excellent job because more than just it being a great superhero film, ""Wonder Woman"" is a very well-made film. It's spectacular in every sense of the word.-- Rama's Screen --","42 out of 91 found this helpful.

Wonder Woman came to save the DCEU. It is a truly perfect film, a round movie from beginning to end that has its closure. It's even one of the best movies ever made. As the story goes many years before the other films doesn't need to leave loose ends or references to connect them with the rest of the universe. The origin is counted in the first half hour; in the island of Themyscira the scenes are quite colorful with a very beautiful tone, unlike what we were showing the previous films, although the plot is short and the characters don't appear much; Antiope (Robin Wright) is spectacular & Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) also does a good job. When England is shown the colors become tenuous (by the tone of the war) engaging the rest of movies; Diana (Gal Gadot) & Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) make an excellent dynamic duo, with good chemistry, charisma and companionship, have a kind of romance & complicity: pure dynamite. The dynamic reminds us of Richard Donner & Christopher Reeve's Superman, the serious drama tone to Tim Burton & Michael Keaton's Batman. Ludendorff (Danny Huston) is a transitional German villain for the plot but it's necessary; Doctor Poison (Helena Anaya) works as a villain, & the final fight with the hidden villain, Ares, is good but it lasts a very short time. If Patty removes that plot, the film stands alone because Diana fighting the Germans is delightful. The tape has a truly altruistic heroism & heart; Justice, freedom & hope; What Man Of Steel should have been. Excellent action scenes, very good choreography and very good production work. The soundtrack is exciting.","20 out of 39 found this helpful.

When the first trailer was released I was quite pumped already. I've always liked Wonder Woman and it was great to finally see her in the silver screen with today's effects and all.Wonder Woman is a great hero. She's strong, intuitive, and tough while still being both compassionate and kind which was essential to her original character; and this movie keeps true to that. Diana in this movie has those same characters and Gal Dadot's performance was very believable.The movie is essentially an origin story which can be hit or miss. The DC Extended Universe movies have not been well received at all, but more on this later. The movie's color scheme is quite clever, showing the island Diana grew up on as a very bright and beautiful with everything outside of it being dark and dreary. It captures the intensity and grit of war, especially the time it takes place in, World War I. There's even a scene where they go into the trenches and it's quite authentic. There isn't a single filler character, even the side characters of the group of soldiers she links up with are entertaining and add a lot of flavor to the movie. My only nitpick is that the music seemed all over the place.This is also a great return for DC movies. As I mentioned before recent DC movies, such as ""Man of Steel"", ""Batman V Superman"" and ""Suicide Squad"" (a movie I actually liked for just how fun it was) weren't greatly reciprocated and for good reasons. But ""Wonder Woman"" nails everything that DC movies in the past were great: balancing comedy and intensity. The movie doesn't have that many comedic moments towards the end but it does have that balance very well in the beginning and the movie benefits because of it.In the end, I highly recommend this film. I feel that it's one most people should enjoy, especially those who have been disappointed by DC movies over the past couple of movies.","20 out of 39 found this helpful.

And it is what I am going to do."" Diana (Gal Gadot)That's a simple manifesto spoken by Amazonian princess Diana, aka to us Wonder Woman. Here's a DC Comics hero to go nose to nose with the big boys from Marvel, at least on a par with the best of them. You go, Girl.From Diana's island paradise, Themyscria, to the WWI front lines, she remains steadfast in her goal to rid the world of war, starting with the one to end all wars. That she cannot end any of our wild wars, even as a demigod, is a lesson she learns.That simplicity is also naivety, but innocence is part of her charm leading to a satisfactory second act where the comedy is affecting in a heroine-out-of water motif in London. The love affair between her and spy Steve (Chris Pine) may be the best this summer because like her, it has innocence and idealism all in one. Although Pine's role may seem to be better written, the actors have an unmistakable chemistry. Do the characters make love? See for yourself, and let me know if you like the answer.The scenes of the origin at the island have a freshness I haven't seen this summer. Amazonian women fly like Cirque-du-Soleil acrobats to dispatch German soldiers; Queen Hippolyta (Connie Neilsen) and her sister, Antiope (Robin Wright), are as believable warriors as Thor and Wolverine, and certainly just as pretty. The idea of an island of competent women does more for feminism than all the high-blown speeches of sociologists, and without the rant.How Diana and Steve help the war to its armistice is part of the film's fun to figure out. The film does not have the rampant sardonic humor of the mature Marvel series (although the mercenary soldiers are amusing), and it relies too much in the third act on those old superhero staples, electricity and excessive mayhem. Yet it does have a heroine more interesting than many of the males who have dominated the genre. Wait, wait! Could a reason for its success be that it's directed by a competent Patty Jenkins? Female hero, female director. That's a Marvelous combination!","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

I read some of the reviews here and they are total bull and lies. Just because Warner Bros gave them an opportunity to watch the movie before others, they wanted to give a good fake ratings.Wonder Woman was supposed to be a breath of fresh air for Wonder Woman revival and to bring a female hero to the screen as it is dominated by male heroes.This movie was a huge miss for me, and I anticipated this movie so much, I knew it would blow me away and I just couldn't wait to see the movie. I ignored all annoying backslashes the movie was getting from fanboys, haters, nerds and anti-Israelis.The movie had everything going so well: the cast, everyone was amazing with the acting, flawless. Props, costumes and settings were top notch. I don't know how they built the old England but was it believable and amazing! I love Wonder Woman's costume so much.It had some comedy to it which were really nice.The story was the biggest gripe for me, I was quite surprised they put a lot of back story to Diana when she was little. But things just went down hill after she kissed the guy. Everything became a messed and it felt like the movie makers ran out of ideas, had budget restrains and just didn't know what to do so they rushed it.One thing I liked about Diana is her naive personality.So far the best DC movie which I approve is Suicide Squad. Every other DC Movies had not impressed me yet and I was hoping this movie would, but sadly DC missed the mark.The thing about Marvel's movie adaptations is that they aim the movie towards people who are aware of who the comic character is. But the story is freshened out for people who are not comic book readers nor do not know about a comic character. And for the hardcore fans of the character who are deep in knowledge with the character's story and universe. Marvel will add little nuggets, clues and cameos in the movie.However this movie just missed the mark. The movie was just aimed at people who don't know anything about Wonder Woman.Also anyone seen God of War Ares use thunder has his powers? shouldn't that be Zeus? also how could Diana be created if Zeus gave his life to create shield for Namascrara?One thing I hated about Wonder Woman is she keeps clapping her wrist together, that thing is so annoying! It is meant to reflect bullets and projectiles but why does she use it as a special attack???R0ttenT0mato obviously gave a false review ratings because of the backslash the movie was getting.Zack Synder wrote the movie, and after 1hr of the movie, the story just turned to mess. I don't think i will be watching Justice League because I was disappointed with this movie!Captain American First Avenger sucked, but Winter Soldier was too freaking amazing! Ant Man, Iron Man and Spiderman are the only first sequel movies that did not suck.Why o why couldn't this movie just get it right?","9 out of 31 found this helpful.

Wonder woman is not even a good superhero movie. It is, however, the best big screen adaptation of the DC heroine so far. Let's hope justice league will be better.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

That being said, it was a bit over-hyped. The story fell a little flat to me. It was fairly predictable (I could tell who Ares really was as soon as that character came on screen). Steve's secretary (honestly don't even remember her name) was so one note. She obviously was written in to be some comic relief but she just didn't end up feeling real. Like for instance, Steve (who was presumed dead) shows up with a strange woman, and she just doesn't question it. Not too mention that whole scene in general was silly to me. Steve has made it clear that getting this notebook back to his superior is incredibly important, so why waste time making Diana try on a bajillion dresses. I mean, I know its to have a funny scene where Diana rips a dress as she tries to fight in them, but it just doesn't make sense in context of the movie. I will say though that I did like the war scenes. I felt like it accurately portrayed what war would have felt like back then. The desperation, the pain, the fear in people's eyes. And I also liked that the film had elements of PTSD in there. It brought another layer of realism in there. Those were some aspects of the story I appreciated.The CGI was lackluster. Certainly not the worst thing ever, but there was a number of times where it looked fairly obvious they were standing in front of a green screen. And they overused the slo-mo in fight scenes.I know this review seems fairly negative, but honestly the film was still really entertaining. And I do appreciate seeing more women driven films, and specifically women superheroes. I just don't think its some huge game changer that people are making it out to be.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

This is the best DC film since the Batman Trilogy from Christopher Nolan. The story is engaging, the characters well developed and even the humour misses being corny. Two things take away from the experience: First, the slow motion effects. When they are well done, like in 300, they work incredibly well, but when they fail they are a major turn off. Zooms on the face or animated jump sequences look incredibly out of place and spoil the pace of the otherwise well choreographed action. Second, and I am sure a lot of people will disagree with me here, the political correctness agenda in this film. It's already a feminist film, by definition. But adding a native Indian American character to World War 1 just so he could utter that one line about the white people destroying ""his people"" is beyond ridiculous. And that's only the most blatant bow to the SJW community. I won't write more, with so many reviews already being up. If you can ignore the above, it's an enjoyable film for sure.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

In that dark world, Wonder Woman's (and/or Gal Gadot) light shines brighter.All Themyscira is perfect and beautiful, as it is all Diana's origin. But the story told works in more than the literal level. The script is superb and well above the generic ones. We have the literal Diana's adventure that ends up with her becoming the hero we know. Then we have the interpretation of War in the world. The naive notion that Diana has, about ending the world by defeating one villain. That translates to the believe that in our world there are clear ""good guys and bad guys"" and with the defeat of the ""bad one"" the wars would stop, when is clearly way more complicated than that.
And it also brings the notion of the people that benefits from War and tries to influence humans to give to them nature of war and conflict, for their benefit. I'm referring to Banks that finance wars, the industrial military complex or just plain and simply the militar arm of x country.And then we have Jenkins really using the Snyder visual style, with amazing sequences and fights choreography with slow motion, but also a bombastic third act that can be a bit much. The villains could've been a bit better. And maybe a bit faster here and there, maybe. Maybe one or two less ""slow motion"" scenes.","5 out of 7 found this helpful.

I would almost say it's harder to pull off than regular comedy because you need to be able to keep people invested in the dramatic aspect of the film, while still keeping them laughing throughout the majority of the duration. Director Martin McDonagh has matured as a filmmaker over the years, starting off with In Bruges, which was pretty much a flat-out comedy, to Seven Psychopaths, which placed him a little further into the spotlight, but I must admit that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is not only his best film to date, but also one of the best films I've received the pleasure of witnessing all year. From laughter to genuine tension and heart, this is a film that's pretty much perfect all around. Here is why I can recommend this film to everyone.After the tragic death of her daughter, Mildred Hayes calls out the local authorities on three billboards, publicly stating that they're not doing their jobs and not a single arrest has happened since the death of her daughter. While publicly displaying this is upsetting to some, she sees it as a point being made. Through some very cleverly written humor throughout the entire film, levity is brought to the table in times of sorrow, making this a very easy movie to watch. Although the story itself is quite depressing, this film is written in a way that will still find a way to make you smile.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

Not to mention her ""resolve"" at the end is a bit unfounded considering she was right about Ares. Not only did that reveal make the Amazon women look like idiots but it also justified her belief in people and in a sense let them off the hook from being selfish and evil in their own way.

Diana could not believe it, so it follows that the God of War, Ares, therefore Diana with Steve van at the center of all the war to defeat Ares.Let's start with the actors. Gal Gadot as Diana Prince is the best part of the film (along with Chris Pine). In addition to the action that was very good, the character is a completely incorruptible. I'm a big fan of the comic, but Wonder Woman never interested me as a character, I really don't have so many expectations for this film, therefore i saw her on the Internet... eh... to follow. As i said before i had so much interest in Wonder Woman, but to see the film and how you think the character inspired me to follow this character. Let us continue with Chris Pine as Steve Trevor. Has Chris Pine you know very well of the Spinnoff/prequel trilogy of Star Trek (directed by J.J Abrams). It is a type that I, as an actor, and this character is everything expected of him. Great character with a great personality.Dc at the end makes a good film. I without exaggeration i left vomiting of the hundred, after seeing Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad. But with this film... surprisingly... no.I like very much the meaning of war that have in the movie, as if there was a God to do that peleasen between them/us. I really liked that part of the movie.The villains I liked. But Ares I liked much more than the other villain.

It is an amazingly good action film but is not very historically accurate. I'm not sure why we are watching this in a history through film class but i'm not complaining. Although the movie does not portray the events it gives great lessons about war and the temptations of mankind. The action scenes throughout the movie are thrilling and fast paced. I really enjoyed the scene where Wonder Woman is battling Ares and when she is rushing across no man's land deflecting all the bullets with her wrists. The special effects in the movie were also amazingly realistic. I was very intrigued by the effects they used for the island that was separated from the rest of the world.","8 out of 13 found this helpful.

As a kid I got a kick out Linda Carter's lasso twirling, 70's fem super hero. Carter fitted the role beautifully and I have to admit skepticism, when I heard yet another remake, of sorts, was on the way, in the form of a Wonder Woman film. I was surprised therefore, at how immediately comfortable I felt watching the latest film. Gal Gadot is a perfect choice for the role of Wonder Woman. Her looks, athleticism and the somewhat exotic accent fit well into this franchise. Better still, the story line, whilst a bit contrived, works well enough to make this a mostly enjoyable, action packed romp. Perhaps the only downside being, what I felt, was a somewhat subdued and uninteresting performance by Chris Pine. I don't mind Pine but somehow I felt he was more fizzle than burn this outing. Look forward to seeing more of him in the Star Trek franchise where he really shines. Casting this small consideration aside, there's a fair bit to like here. Don't over think it or expect anything by way of a revelation, it is comic book super hero land after all. If you are sensible enough to sit back and simply enjoy this fun action flick for what it is, you wont be disappointed. Seven out of ten from me.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Yes, it had some flaws but overall I liked it, it gave a good introduction to Wonder Woman, her background and motivations, how the character thinks and what her identity is.
After reading negative reviews, it makes you really want to hate this movie, all this negative energy.
But no, I enjoyed it for major parts, I feel too much sympathy for it to give it less than 7*.
It's not as complex as Batman v Superman, not as bad as Suicide Squad, it has a good mix of amusement, emotions, awesome settings/props/production, action. It has solid parts and I'd say it's close to be great.
I think some of the villains had to be a bit more convincing and Gal Gadot, while she is extremely beautiful, had to have a stronger physique, especially stronger legs (but hey, that's maybe being too nit-picky, also she was pregnant) to give the movie the final push to be awesome. Also, the CGI was good for the most parts, but similar to 'Black Panther' it sometimes doesn't look 100% correct.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Once they've left the idyllic fantasyland of this island paradise, however, the femme fighter's deep-seated na√Øvet√© bubbles to the surface and our soldier splits time between babysitting and desperately redirecting the brunt of her morally-indignant rage toward the enemy.Flavorful and energetic, Wonder Woman has a lot of good ideas, but it struggles to unify them in a mixed setting. And, perhaps coincidentally, many of its central themes directly overlap with Marvel's competing films. It shares a ground-level war setting with Captain America. Mythological fantasy / fish out of water elements with Thor. Black Panther's insular society, deliberately isolated from the modern world. Each one has a unique twist, of course - tweaks and eccentricities to distinguish this character from the rest - but it's still all-too easy to draw those parallels, and the numerous comparison points make this film seem less daring and original. Poor effects work often lets Wonder Woman down, too. Particularly where the use of her powers are concerned, there's a stiffness, a distinct sense of detachment from reality, that robs important scenes of their implied power. We can see the strings, in other words, and that draws our focus away from the bigger picture.Gal Gadot certainly looks the part of an Amazon, a stunning mix of elegance and athleticism, but her chances to show personality and take ownership of the role are limited. For such a specifically character-driven story, that's a major problem. The supporting cast picks up some of the slack this time around, but presumably they won't be around for the forthcoming sequel, as it's set nearly seventy years in the future. All in all, this was a light dose of conceptual fun, but I'm going to need a better reason to stick around for the next one.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Diana is too preachy; her self-righteous monologues and dialogues contribute nothing to the film, to the contrary, they rob the viewer of the suspense and enjoyment of the film. 2- This is a fantasy/action movie but there is not much action and, the mixing of fantasy with an element of warped history does not help either. Of course the producers were aware of what they were doing. They deliberately depicted the Turks as the partners of the Nazi Germans who developed chemical weapons during WWI. Sorry, I am not a 5 year old and I know for sure that Nazi Germany had not existed until 1930s and the Turks had stayed neutral during WWII. Actually, to the contrary of what the movie shows, the Turks saved a lot of Jews from the hands of the Nazis. If the producers were looking for a Nazi collaborator, I wonder why they didn't chose a different nation who indeed helped the Nazis during the war e.g Switzerland, Sweden, Italy or Japan...I wonder if John Kerry used his influence over the Hollywood producers when he met them last February. Of course, one should know why the US has created so many superhero Hollywood characters. Such superhero characters have merely served towards the US's goals during the 40's, 50's and the cold war era against the Soviets (Capitalism V Communism). By the looks of it such superheroes will serve the US's foreign policies for a long long time to come. 3- The message of the film is rather laughable considering the number of people Diana already killed, her shouting about love at Ares was particularly silly at this point. First kill and then send love messages. Yeah sure... We have seen this scenario in real life indeed. No, the world does not need a superhero thank you Bush, Obama, Trump, Kelly... LIKES1- This is not a low budget film by any standards. Costumes, special effects etc were all good. 2- It is good to see a strong female superhero amongst the male dominated superhero characters. 3- Fighting scenes were good but I would have expected to see more of them.","71 out of 159 found this helpful.

Wonder Woman delivers good origin story, decent action (no over the top CGI destruction porn), good fight scenes, funny moment, nice romantic moments between Diana & Steve Trevor (Chris Pine).I was concern with this film back then because of the DCEU's poor reputation and Gal Gadot as an actress to pull off Wonder Woman in her own film BUT she and the movie proved me wrong. She impressed me as Wonder Woman, she embodied the character much like how Christopher Reeve embodied Superman, good job Gal. Im not a fan of Wonder Woman but I know some things about her and pretty much this film captures the essence of the character and story, I believe its based on the new 52 series. Im glad that Wonder Woman was finally given the chance to shine (giving a break to the usual Batman/Superman) and deservedly praised. WB needs to keep on shining the rest of the DC superheroes.I enjoyed Chris Pine as Steve Trevor: Cool, bold, courageous, funny, passionate and determined, Chris Pine nailed it. Him and Gal had chemistry. I'd love to see him again!I don't want to say much but Wonder Woman is worth watching.

It's great that here we have a film that actually tackles more relevant themes that include the brutality of war and humankind, rather than another generic Marvel ""Let's save the world from this evil supernatural guy."" The entire storyline and villains aren't a complete success, and sometimes there's some awkwardness to be found. However, the two leads of the film, Gal Gadot and Chris Pine, are endlessly charming and have such electric chemistry. Truly a great duo. Their dialogue together make up the best sections of the film and they're fantastic together.

And it's Gal Gadot playing the infamous bad ass hero. I really loved her as Wonder Woman, she plays the character not only with a tough heroic persona, but also with a very strong sense of heart and morality. She brings depth and empathy to the role, which is of course very much needed. Chris Pine stars alongside Gadot, and I can't think of a better actor to play Pine's character. He is the love interest of Wonder Woman, a soldier she meets at the beginning. He is of course an extremely good looking man, but he brings more than just a rugged handsome face to the role, he also brings emotion and depth and his chemistry with Gadot is very believable and the audience is automatically pulled into their story. Their connection really en-chances the movie overall. Diana (Wonder Woman) and her personal growth in the movie is also a big part of the plot. We see her grow and discover things about herself and the world, we see her connection with Pine and where that goes, and then of course we get to see a lot of cool action sequences, especially towards the end when the true enemy is revealed. I give Wonder Woman an 8/10 overall, pretty entertaining well made superhero flick.","6 out of 9 found this helpful.

"7","/10","One of the better superhero flicks","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4124722/?ref_=tt_urv","JamesHitchcock","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2955724/?ref_=tt_urv","10 April 2018","Although Wonder Woman is, together with Batman and Superman, one of the most iconic of all comic-book superheroes, she has not featured very much in Hollywood's long-running love-affair with the superhero movie, an affair dating back at least as far as the original Christopher Reeve ""Superman"" from forty years ago. This is surprising, because some much more obscure characters (Electra anyone?) have been dredged up from the Marvel and DC universes and given their own films. Hollywood has even taken to inventing its own superheroes, like Black Scorpion who was a film character first, a television one second and a comic-book one third. I have heard two possible explanations for the neglect of Wonder Woman. One is that, although she was originally intended as a symbol of female empowerment, her skimpy costume has made her more of a male fantasy-figure, and film-makers have been afraid that they will be accused of sexism if they allow her to keep that costume and of political over-correctness if she is forced to exchange it for something less revealing. The other is that the character is too closely associated in the public's mind with Lynda Carter from the seventies TV series for them to accept any other actress in the role. In ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" from 2016, however, she was given a supporting role, and now she takes centre stage. Superheroes fall into three categories. There are those like Batman who have no actual superpowers and rely upon a combination of athleticism and hi-tech devices. There are those like Spiderman and the Hulk who are born normal humans but acquire their powers by accident. And then there are those who possess superhuman powers because they are not actually human, like Superman who is an alien from the planet Krypton. Wonder Woman falls into this last category. She is an Amazon, one of a race of demi-goddesses created by Zeus to defend the world against the evil war-god Ares. (This is a version of Greek mythology which might have been unfamiliar to the Ancient Greeks, who generally regarded the Amazons either as mortal women or as daughters of Ares). Among the Amazons Wonder Woman goes by the Latin name Diana whereas all the others have Greek ones. Some might claim this as a goof, but this was her name in the original comic strip, and the film-makers doubtless wanted to respect tradition. In any case ""Diana"" is more familiar to English speakers and easier to pronounce than the likes of ""Hippolyta"", ""Antiope"" or ""Melanippe"". The story is set in late 1918, during the closing days of World War One. If Zeus charged the Amazons with watching over the world they seem to have been asleep on their watch because, isolated on their hidden island of Themyscira, they have been blissfully unaware of the war raging in the rest of the world until Steve Trevor, an American spy, crashes a stolen German aircraft on their shores. When Diana, as Wonder Woman is known on Themiscyra, learns from Steve about this dreadful conflict she leaves her home to try and end it and to thwart the machinations of Ares. At first it seems that Diana's task will not be too difficult because the German General Staff, convinced that the military situation is hopeless, have persuaded the Kaiser to sue for peace. The fly in the ointment, however, is General Ludendorff who believes that the war can still be won with the aid of a new type of poison gas invented by a brilliant but evil female scientist. (This plotline may owe something to the sixties movie ""Fraulein Doktor""). I must admit that I deliberately missed this film when it was shown in cinemas, largely because I had less-than-fond memories of the aforementioned TV series. Carter was undoubtedly one of the most beautiful young actresses of the seventies, but her talent did not match her beauty, and her fellow cast members were no better; I was surprised when Debra Winger, who played Carter's equally scantily clad little sister, later emerged as a successful, gifted and rather serious Hollywood actress. The plots, whether Wonder Woman was helping the Allies defeat the Nazis or assisting with law enforcement in contemporary America, were dull and predictable. Fortunately, the film is a lot better than its television predecessor. The statuesque Gal Gadot not only has the looks needed for the title role but also has the acting skills to go with them. There is another good performance from Chris Pine as Steve, initially a rather cocky, headstrong young man, but one who proves himself capable of courage and self-sacrifice. The relocation of the story from the 1940s to 1918 caused some controversy, but I felt it was the right idea. Wonder Woman in World War Two was always going to be a warrior in a partisan cause, fighting for our side (good) against their side (evil). Here Gadot plays her as a fighter for peace, someone who is not only strong and courageous but also loving and compassionate. Her enemies are not the Germans, but anyone of any nationality who rejects peace and seeks to prolong the conflict, and this characterisation gives the story a greater moral depth and power than would have been possible with a simple goodies-against-baddies storyline. This depth is emphasised by director Patty Jenkins, who gives the film a surprisingly dark and sombre visual tone, about as far from the cartoonish look of the television series as you can get. Superhero flicks have not always been my favourite film genre, but this is one of the better ones of recent years. 7/10A goof. The idea of producing a new poison gas by replacing the sulphur in mustard gas with hydrogen just would not work, scientifically speaking.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I am deeply amazed anyone could give this garbage more than 2 stars out of 10. The acting is terrible, jokes are awkward, CG is the worst I've seen in years. Even 20 years old movies are better on that front. Almost every scene is with extreme DOF and all characters look like cut out and placed in fake and badly rendered environments. The lighting is totally off. The dialog is so horrible. I've read opinions this movie is much better that Suicide Squad. To me SS is in a different league. It is entertaining and the love story between Harley Queen and Joker is enough to make the whole movie. Wonder Woman is even worse than Batman vs Superman, which is one of the most boring movies I've ever watched.","101 out of 233 found this helpful.

Unfortunately, because it took so long getting here, I can't help but draw comparisons to other works that came before it, making Wonder Woman seem derivative. In fact, had this movie come out eight years ago, it would have made Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and Thor (2011) look like they were copying it. As it stands, though, Wonder Woman feels formulaic, even if the superhero is a woman instead of a man.I will grant that some of the jokes come at the expense of the ""fish out of water"" character of Diana (Gal Gadot), playing on her na√Øvet√© of the ""modern world"" for laughs (a la Thor) but with a more sexualized context because she's a woman. There were a few missed opportunities to add depth to the character via these circumstances, the interaction with Chief Napi (Eugene Brave Rock) being one of them (as the Amazons and the Blackfoot tribe were likely very isolated from each other). Either way, the levity helped to break up the incredible action sequences.The action sequences in Wonder Woman served a few purposes, both of which helped develop the titular character. The acrobatic style of the Amazons looks a little ridiculous when they're fighting each other, but thoroughly brutal when they're fighting anyone else. While she dominated on the battlefield, showing that she could conquer ""no man's land"" (an apt observation of her gender), when she struggled against the main antagonist of the film, her vulnerability made her a much more interesting character. After all, it's tiresome to see an overpowered character with no obstacles to slow them down. That being said, I think the film could have gone in an interesting direction if the antagonist got away since most superhero movies end with the hero winning.A wonderful film that draws too many comparisons, I give Wonder Woman 4.0 stars out of 5.","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

Is this really the worst movie you reviewers have ever seen? ""Woder Woman"" has it's flaws, sure, but is far from the worst movie i've ever seen. In fact, I found this to be one of the better superhero movies i've seen recently. As I stated before, this movie has it's flaws; the beginning of the film, while necessary I suppose to explain the backstory, felt fairly contived to me. The acting was mediocre at best (Robin Wright's character, Antiope, most of all) and the ""Amazon kingdom"", where Diana (Wonder Woman) is from, felt hastily pieced together. Once the film leaves the island, however, things improve quite a bit. Now on to some positives. I felt that the supporting cast did an excellent job in this film. Chris Pine delivers another solid performance, which is to be expected these days. Danny Huston puts in a believable performance as the evil German general and, in my opinion, served as the best antagonist in the film. Ewen Bremner also does a good job in his usual ""silly character"" role which has seemingly followed him since his first big performance in ""Trainspotting"". Gal Gadot does a fine job in the leading role, delivering what I felt was a fairly authentic performance overall. This film takes place during the Great War of 1918 which was an intriguing choice in my opinion. The setting seems pretty believable considering the context, which helps draw you into the film. The action scenes are, for the most part, well executed and aren't so frequent as to compromise the plot. This film does have a semblence of a plot, too, which is a big reason why I liked it. Many superhero movies forgo the plot for constant action, which luckily ""Wonder Woman"" does not do. This allows us a chance to spend some time with the interesting characters. I felt the humor in this film was really well done as well, and did not seem forced like so many movies do. It also fit the time period fairly well. The ending has it's issues, but overall I felt it climaxed at the proper time and ended at the proper time as well. While the runtime is quite long (2 hours 20 minutes), it never felt dull apart from the first 25 minutes or so. There is one particularly emotional scene right before the end that I felt was really well done, especially for a movie such as this. The conclusion leaves room for sequels like all superhero movies do, and while I don't really care for these types of endings, it was expected nonetheless. Overall this film is indeed flawed, but I still enjoyed it as a whole. it is certainly not worthy of all these 1 star reviews it is receiving (is this movie seriously on par with Battlefield: Earth? I think not). While I was hesitant to watch it, in the end i'm glad I did. Watch it for yourself before passing judgement and see if you agree with me. This is the best DC movie thus far in my opinion, and well worth the chance.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

BUT, considering that, Wonder Woman is one of the best superhero movies I've seen to date. Heres why.
Superhero films that contradict with actual world history don't typically please me, but this one was good. Gal Gadot did a fantastic job in this role. She pulls it off perfectly. All the other characters play their roles extremely well. Everything from the environment to the sets to the special effects to the costumes. It all contributes to the nice, appealing look of this superhero film. There are funny parts, and super intense parts.
My 2 nit picks with this film are that it seems General Ludendorff was the only German general with an actual German accent. Um, and the other one was that the filtering in this film seemed a bit over done in some areas. But overall great film!","7 out of 11 found this helpful.

It is a bit high on melodrama and they fail to do the justice to the character of Wonder Woman with weak background story. Having said that, Gal Gadot definitely gave her best, even though I feel she was more intimidating in FF franchise. Story (6/10): There is a fine line between sounding fascinating and sounding ridiculous and I guess the writers here crossed that line. Set up in the era of WW2 (1930s and 40s), Princess Diana of Amazon is raised in a well protected - all ladies - environment among female warriors of Amazon in a remote island where she is the only kid. As she grows up, she realizes her potential and super powers. The island is specially protected to prevent any attack from their nemesis, Ares. However, Diana has her first encounter with the real world when Steve crashes his plane near the island and Diana comes to know about the world war. This triggers her to help Steve end the war by killing Areas (who she thinks is responsible for the war) and, in the process, ends up discovering her true supernatural powers. The beginning of the story was very weak and that almost killed the story department. Certain events were inexplicable and not coherent with the events shown a couple of scenes back. Screenplay was much better than the story per se - some of the punches, especially related to Diana's first encounter in the real world were great. Acting (8/10): Clearly it was Gal Gadot's movie and she dominated very well. Her natural aggression without putting up explicit expressions gave her a good edge when playing a super woman. Her chemistry with Chris Pine was perhaps the next best thing in the movie. Chris Pine was amazing to watch. Besides the lead pair, two other characters made a very strong presence felt in the movie, Danny Huston and David Thewlis. Danny Huston was brilliant, playing a very intimidating character of Ludendorff - a German General. David Thewlis, playing Sir Patrick - a member of the Supreme War Council of Allied forces in WW2, was great to watch. Direction (7/10): Patty Jenkins made a good effort with a little weak story at hand. The pacing of the movie was quite good. With the above average length, he perhaps ended up creating more than required which could have been edited out. The climax, in particular, was quite long with hyper melodramatic sequences which tested the patience of the audience. His use of Diana's character, who was experiencing the male dominated world for the first time to convey an unbiased view of how things should be in an ideal world, was great. Aesthetically as well, the movie was made really well. Overall (7/10): Definitely to be watched, especially as it breaks into the male dominated superhero world. Bravo to Gal Gadot, whom we would love to see more in such strong characters - even if not a superhero.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Watching those films is just like breathing in a suspicious magic potion only to find that you're under a spell you can't break free from. But this review shouldn't be about Marvel. This should just be about me telling you that finally, it is now DC's moment to shine in the spotlight. This film is a renaissance of sorts and has been able to bring back memories of the glory days--when we were all watching the Dark Knight movies (gosh, has it really been that long?).There are some things that differentiate a good film from a bad one and one of those is character building. I have spent quite some time ""researching"" Marvel characters and reading their backstories, being the superhero geek that I am. But going into this film, I thought, ""I have no idea who Wonder Woman (aka Diana Prince) is and have only seen a rather dissatisfying appearance of hers in Batman vs Superman. Will I really grow to like her?"". The answer to that as I have found out now, is ""yes""-- a big one. This is an origin story so obviously, there was a lot of character building. We got to know where she came from, what her beliefs were and how that affected her actions. From her childhood to her adult life, she is shown to be a very passionate and warm individual but also very strong (literally, too) and aggressive when she needs to be, which is a beautiful equilibrium that somehow suits women the best. Greatness wasn't thrust upon her‚Äîshe was born with it. She didn't undergo a revelation in her mid-twenties and decide that it was time for her to save the world, because she was always destined to do that and she knew it. Gal Gadot, really proves her worth and makes every aspect of the character she plays, believable. A bit like Captain America, the world Wonder Woman discovers is completely alien to her and something about that genuine innocence catches my approval all the time. It is also a great source of comedy. I didn't watch Suicide Squad, so I may be wrong, but it seems to me, that this is the first DC movie that has been able to strike a very good balance between humor and gravity. Maybe they've tried to follow Marvel's footsteps, but no matter it has yielded good results. There is also a fair bit of romance in this film that a lot of other superhero movies of the recent past haven't had. Since that is another ingredient to add to the batter, I must say they've proportioned all the elements skillfully and have baked the cake quite well.The film is engaging right from the very first moment. The action and tension aren't too overpowering despite the backdrop, being that of the First World War. They're there exactly when we need them to be, to keep the rhythm steady. No part of the film lags behind and makes us want to see some extra pace. Another thing that stood out for me was the element of mystery right from the beginning of the film, made clear to the viewer. We know where Wonder Woman spent all her life growing up but we're never told exactly what her lineage is. That keeps us excited throughout the film, as we know there is something yet to be discovered. The twist in the last act really caught me off guard and is probably one the best ones, I've seen. Despite its long run-time it doesn't feel stretched, thanks to some great direction and editing. The plot is very well conceived and apart from the obvious powers that our lead possesses and their resulting effects, nothing seems too wild to be true; no deus ex machina, here. Chris Pine's character, Captain Steve is extremely likable as well and is the perfect friend and support. Along with some other people, he and Diana give us a great display of togetherness and form quite the unlikely team of heroes.However, a couple of minor shortcomings come to mind. The Amazons, Wonder Woman grew up with, don't end up being as important as they're shown to be in the beginning. They never really play a great role in anything much. I was hoping they would all come together to help our leading lady in the end but that never happens. Also, I'd have liked to see some of the events that transpired during the transition from the 1910s to the present day which lead WW to be in the place that she is now. But maybe that's for some other day. These points are still, not enough to deter someone from watching this film. It is enrapturing and comes at us like a dark horse. The best thing is that now, more and more people will consider making such films with a powerful female lead. Hopefully the upcoming DC productions will be able to build a tradition of quality on this strong foundation. Maybe then, I might even begin to question my allegiance.","13 out of 24 found this helpful.

Once the big twist is revealed and the character gets in to what we would call the final ""boss battle"", it went by very fast and got resolved before we got a chance to really get invested. The cast is all around fantastic, such as David Thewlis in a terrifically layered role and Ewen Bremner bringing great characterisation, as well comic relief. The highlight is without a doubt Gal Gadot, who delivers a performance as Wonder Woman that I believe will truly go on to be iconic, and Chris Pine as Steve Trevor. He had a presence in this role that was very intriguing, it was clear that the character really clicked with him, he was funny and charming. A widely entertaining superhero film that has a perfect tone that this universe should try to maintain. Engaging and great fun, Wonder Woman is miles better than I expected, largely due to director Kathy Jenkins' unique vision, it is a special movie that is different to most superhero flicks, worth the watch to anyone looking for a good adventure of fantasy film. When a pilot crash lands in her world, Wonder Woman heads to fight in a war, discovering her true destiny. Best Performance: Chris Pine","12 out of 22 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Exhilarating superhero spectacle from start to finish, Wonder Woman is an entertaining hit","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3721933/?ref_=tt_urv","Screen_Blitz","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur24623283/?ref_=tt_urv","2 June 2017","After suffering from two cinematic misfires 'Batman Vs. Superman' and 'Suicide Squad', the DC cinematic universe has managed to find light at the end of the tunnel with this exhilarating superhero action spectacle Wonder Woman. Needless to say, the hype for this one is high. Introduced in the aforementioned Batman Vs. Superman and set to appear in the upcoming DC hype 'Justice League', the eponymous superhero is treated with a stunning cinematic experiment that brings more than just eye-popping visual heft and a pulse- pounding narrative. It firmly embraces the dazzling nature of the titular hero from the comic books without leaving out room for some political themes and a surprising emotional heft many entries of the widely popular genre neglect. This is all brought beautifully together by director Patty Jenkins, first female director behind a superhero flick in history. Furthermore, it marks the first female-centric superhero flick since the horribly panned 'Elektra' twelve years ago. This film follows Diane (played by Gal Gabot), a young lady born and raised by her mother Queen Hippolyta (played by Connie Nielson) on an island entirely inhabited of women. Upon saving Steve Trevor (played by Chris Pine), a British pilot who crash lands into the ocean, Diane grows eager to help fight as a warrior in the European front during World War I. Against her mother's wishes, Diane sets out with Steve to Europe the defeat the God of War Ares who they believe the cause behind this tragic war -- all while becoming the famous Wonder Woman in the process.Whereas 'Captain America: The First Avenger' set its titular hero in the era of World War II, this one sets its hero in the height of World War I, the war that many referred to as ""the war to end all wars"". With the Great War serving as the backdrop of the plot, this open doors to some surprisingly clever themes surrounding the titular character and the atmosphere. As with many superhero movies, this one kicks off with an origin story showcasing Diane's upbringing in a world dominated by women, and her inspiration of becoming a warrior following her encounter with Steve Trevor followed by her family's harrowing attack by the German Army. The premise along the long journey that follows is greatly strewn together by themes of women empowerment, a political issue that ran rampant during the World War I era. Without overarching the story, the political themes and the story's ideology about mankind being the catalyst of war nicely fuel the versatility of the plot, especially when the hero and Steve Trevor come to the epiphany towards the end. Furthermore, the chemistry between Gal Gabot's Wonder Woman and Chris Pine's Steve Trevor is genuine and, unlike many action flick, never drags into ham-fisted territory. Both of their performances are swell, particularly Gabot who boasts great versatility in the lead role. And the humor, which pokes fun at the feminist themes throughout the picture, is surprisingly clever, if occasionally awkward. Like in many superhero entities, the action sequences which consists of a prolonged fight sequence on a rugged German battlefield, a fight sequence on a beach, and the final climatic battle at the end are all visually impressive and exhilarating to watch. The final fight sequence in particular sets stone to unexpected emotional resonance, while splashing the screen with abundance of colorful CGI -- more better or worse. Wonder Woman is a spectacular superhero action thrill ride from beginning to end, and represents nearly everything that makes a superhero movie entertaining. It is a film that defies against the disappointment of the DC cinematic universe's previous entries and marks a game changer for the DC comics' cinematic cosmos. It is not a perfect picture, but it is certainly one that is more than worth seeing.","12 out of 22 found this helpful.

Mainly because of the woman oriented theme. People were desperate to see the solo woman superhero. Today, we have the great visual effects technology, that anything can be possible to bring on to the screen. And actress like Gal Gadot, even better it gets. Yes, it was a wonderful film. A simple storyline, but a well made film.The Amazonians who are cut off from the rest of the world, is preparing for the battle if Ares returns. All these years nothing has happened, but one day a fighter pilot crash on the cost of their island. Then the princess embark a journey back with him to find, and end the Ares threat forever. But she only ends up in the WWII, and what happens in the following sequence are the rest of the film.Who would have done a better job than Patty Jenkins. She nailed it, and so set to direct the sequel too. Even the supporting cast was good. DC's visuals always high standards and so this one. Action sequences too amazing. There's lots of changes in the character, as well as in everything. Firstly a nice superhero costume. And connections like Diana's father, the island, all pretty nicely written out. The DC universe just got extended. I can't wait to see 'Justice League'.8/10","12 out of 22 found this helpful.

Despite its mythology and practical inaccuracies, WW was very pleasant to watch and had the quality direction and artistic-sequences that Snyder used us to expect.I read afterwards the surprisingly too many hating reviews which could be categorized in 3 categories: those who judge as documentary commentators, those whose views are biased by Marvel and those who doubt the impartiality of IMDb.To the 1st I have to say that at this moment BBC produces a supposed accurate retelling of Trojan war, including black actors as Achilles and Patroclos. While in a first script of WW, she was supposed to be of extraterrestrial origin and Superman's kin! So you can understand my relief when I found out that it wasn't the case and that mythology damages were contained. To the 2nd I will retort that except Dr Strange and the 1st Captain America I didn't see any memorable movie or TV series from Marvel whose stories are inconsistent and boring. To the 3rd I would advise to check Box Office Mojo where WW stands 5th in all-time comic adaptations.Despite a few scenario holes and a couple of bad CGI, the movie respects the feminist ideas conveyed traditionally by the character and provides a good entertainment","15 out of 29 found this helpful.

She's just a mortal (or so it seemed for most of the movie), and she manages to charge lines of armed enemy soldiers, deflecting hundreds of bullets coming at her all at once in different directions (even with her bracelets, etc). (Superman came from a different world and had super powers. Batman was human (like seemingly Wonder Woman) but handled just small crime gangs and individual criminals.) I also cringed at the fierce practice sword fighting scenes among the Amazon women: a wonder no one would get hurt. (2) I am not a prude but at one point in the movie there was continual references to nude Steve Trevor's (offscreen) genitalia -- blatant references and much innuendo. It seemed out of place in a movie like this. Surprised me. I guess we are in a new age.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

The reason why I gave this movie a 3 is because of the UNBELIEVABLE hype it got and the only reason for that is because it's a super-hero movie directed by a woman and it stars a woman. (I don't hate women, and I am not anti-women at all, because nowadays if you say those things you will be labelled women hater for no reason). So to balance it off I am giving it 3 stars, because seeing it's getting 8s/9s that it never deserves.The first thing I absolutely hated about this movie and it's the SAME thing with BatmanVSuperman & Suicide Squad, literally EVERYTHING you saw in the trailer were the ""best"" and most ""important"" parts in the movie. You don't even have to go to the movie because you can watch those trailers.The story and the movie itself were so boring, there was nothing happening at all, you don't feel anything for the characters and character development was nowhere to be found , the movie was dark, except for the themyscira part , and don't get me wrong I have nothing against dark/heavy movies (The Dark Knight is one of my favorite movies) , but the cinematography in the movie falls short. I don't want to even start about the forced jokes and the one-liners that were made especially for the cinema audience.So what was ""good"" about the movie: I thought the pacing and the story structure were actually better than BatmanVSuperman & Suicide Squad. You had a beginning , a middle part and a end part that made sense and were not all over the place. The fighting sequence and the special effects were also good enough, not mind blowing but it was nice. The acting was not bad, The only one I really didn't like was Gal Gadot. She does not have something special except that she is nice looking , but to be honest she was not bad or something I've seen worse.The story itself was OK, everything made sense and like I said it suited the pacing well.Overall the movie was slighty better than BvS and Suicide Squad because of the pacing and the movie structure, the bad guy in this movie was as bad as those other movies and it had the same problems as the other 2 movies.What I really don't understand, this amazes me, fumes me, blowes my mind, is how is it possible that the ones responsible for DCU and are calling the shots are still giving Zack Snyder & Co a chance. BatmanVSuperman was so bad it damaged the image of those 2 beloved characters, Suicide Squad was ridiculous bad and now Wonder Woman falls in the same category. I made up my mind, even if I love DC so much I will not be going to Justice League , even if it get's a 10/10, what it certainly will not seeing Zack snyder is responsible for this it will be a big turd as well.","19 out of 36 found this helpful.

WW is the step in the right direction for the universe and gives it the kick it needs to hopefully make this universe stronger. While this film was a vast improvement over the other outings in the DCEU it still suffers from issues that plague most modern superhero movies. First the strong points. The first act set on Themyscira is a department from other films in the DCEU in that it actually has colour which makes the world seem like a better place and helps to show the strength of the amazons. This setting helps to see that WW is a good character with hope, something which the DCEU version of superman lacks. The first act also gives us the start of the relationship between WW and ST (Chris Pine), while I have issues with the Love of the relationship I could not help but notice the incredible chemistry between the two and both put in some of their best acting ever. This acting continued all through the film and only got stronger. Unlike the previous films in the universe it actually has moments of light and comic relief. The setting of WW1 is strong as it is not a time period which is used in major films to often. In tone with the setting the costumes help in selling the period with all players looking like soldiers. WW costume has went through slight changes from her appearance on BvS in that its more colourful, this is a strong change as it helps to sell the hope that she has for the world and mankind The action in the movie is incredible and the stunt work is done extremely well. The film is well paced with each part moving at a reasonable rate. This is down to the lack of any sharp editing of the movie like what happened to BvS and SS. Last point, the film is allowed to breath and only contains small nods to a wider universe, it acts as its own movie.Now for the negatives. While the action in the movie is strong, it suffers from an overuse of slow-mo as well as moving to fast which makes some action beats seem rushed. The film relies to heavily on cgi and it is most clear in the final act of the film. Their are moments in the film when it is clear that the actors are working with a green screen. The film suffers from some of the same problems that plague both DC and Marvel movies such as the cgi heavy final act as well as the weak villain characters and most supporting characters. The villains of the film are not used enough in the film which hampers any character development for them. The same goes for the supporting cast of the film, some are used for comic relief and others are barely used at all. Their are some great actors on the movie who are not giving enough screen time which is a shame. Some of the best jokes and action beats have been ruined in the trailers and while it does not hamper the film too much, it would have been nice to see them fresh in the film. The relationship between the two leads at times felt too forced. There were certain moments that felt to similar to events that happened in the first captain America film and it ruined the story a bit. So while the film did have its issues, it was still a good movie and is the best in the DCEU. It hopefully shows that the studio now sees what needs to be done and they are willing to fix it.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

I just wish there was more mythological aspect within the film because of Diana's greek roots but otherwise it was fantastic.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's a wonder that this woman had to wait so long to have a movie of her own, especially considering how long Hollywood has been giving us superhero movies and how many of them have been made. Wonder Woman first appeared in DC Comics in 1941 and has had her own comic book series ever since. In 1975, the character finally made her flesh-and-blood debut with her eponymous TV series starring Lynda Carter as the Amazon princess who, under the name of Diana Prince, used her superpowers, her Lasso of Truth and her invisible airplane to help the U.S. Army fight the Nazis in World War II. But that series only lasted until 1979. In the years since, DC superheroes like Superman and Batman have each appeared on the big screen in multiple incarnations, with different actors playing the roles. When those two made a movie together in 2016, Wonder Woman (played by Israeli actress Gal Gadot) joined them and the following year finally gets a movie all her own. And ""Wonder Woman"" (PG-13, 2:21) is only the beginning.Diana (Gadot) grows up on the isolated, uncharted island of Themyscira, the only child on the island and last child of the Greek god Zeus. Diana is fascinated by the constant close combat training of the adult Amazon women around her and wants to learn to fight too. Diana's mother, Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), doesn't want that for her daughter, but Hippolyta's sister, General Antiope (Robin Wright, from Netflix's ""House of Cards""), secretly indulges the young girl's desire. Diana grows up hearing tales of how Ares, the God of War, killed all of the other gods and, jealous of Zeus' affection for mankind, wants to use his powers to end their existence on earth. Ares' rivalry with Zeus culminates in Ares mortally wounding Zeus, who created and placed on Themyscira a weapon capable of killing Ares. As Diana matures, she becomes well-educated and, eventually with her mother's grudging approval, also becomes a skilled fighter. She instructs Antiope to train Diana harder than any Amazon has ever been trained, alluding to a secret from Diana's past, and a destiny she doesn't want to reveal to her daughter.Diana's idyllic world is shattered one day when an American fighter pilot named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash lands in the waters surrounding Themyscira. Diana saves his life and protects him as the Germans pursuing him come ashore and get into a fierce battle with the Amazons. Afterwards, Diana, struggling to get over the novelty of seeing her first man, uses her Lasso of Truth to learn who Steve is and what he's doing there. She hears of the horrors of the ongoing War to End All Wars (which no one yet realizes is only the First World War) and becomes convinced that Ares must be responsible. Steve has stolen the notes of a German chemical warfare mastermind known as Doctor Poison (Elena Anaya) and is determined to deliver it to his superiors in London. Diana convinces Steve that she can help him do that if he will then take her to the front where she is convinced that she can stop the war. These goals run the pair afoul of sadistic German General Erich Ludendorff (Danny Huston) and Sir Patrick Morgan (David Thewlis), a government official who doesn't want his armistice negotiations derailed.""Wonder Woman"" serves the time-honored character, her followers and your average #MovieFan fairly well. The script comes from Allan Heinberg (a long-time television writer crossing over into film for the first time), based on a story by himself, Jason Fuchs (writer of ""Pan"" & ""Ice Age: Continental Drift"") and Zach Snyder (who is one of the producers of this film and is known for writing and/or directing the ""300"" films, ""Sucker Punch"", the 2013 and 2016 Superman movies and November 2017's ""Justice League""). The plot serves as a good origin story for the title character, even enhancing her mythology and placing her in World War I (rather than WWII, like the 1970s TV series), allowing for subtext which includes women's rights (the suffrage movement) and the development of modern mechanized warfare (large-scale killing of people at a distance). The culture shock she experiences meeting men and encountering western society for the first time allows for amusing and humorous moments which feel organic. The action is intense, but the violence relatively bloodless. And the heroine's appearance is terrifically styled.Topping the list of the movie's significant strengths (and hiding its weaknesses) is the great acting, especially Godot's. The beautiful, agile and talented actress is the perfect choice to bring this character into the 21st century, giving her a complex and pleasing mix of strength, vulnerability, determination, compassion, intelligence and sex appeal. She's a warrior, a woman and, most of all, a human being. On closer inspection, however, the film's flaws emerge. The character of General Ludendorff behaves and transforms in ways that aren't only far removed from the historical record, but which don't even make sense in the context of the plot. The same holds true for some of the other characters, but the film's larger problem is in its overall plotting. The rote interpretation of superhero genre conventions keeps the movie from being as creative and exciting as it could have and should have been. Still, ""Wonder Woman"" is the best DC film since the 2005-2012 Christopher Nolan / Christian Bale ""Batman"" series and it's refreshingly lighter in tone than that trilogy and other cinematic incarnations of the Dark Knight and the Man of Steel in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This movie, in spite of its imperfections, is strong and entertaining enough to warrant a recommendation ‚Äì and give Movie Fans hope for the cinematic future of the Amazon princess and her DC partners in fighting for justice. ""B+""","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Why had no one, a sailor for instance, discovered Wonder Woman's island before? You might think I'm nitpicking but it's lazy writing and bad storytelling. Also, I reckon the writers got the idea from 'Time Bandits' (1981). When the pilot and Wonder Woman get to London (which looked awesome) there's this questionable clothes shopping scene; Wonder Woman cloaked in black seemed to be blending in; concealing her sword and shield just fine without having to change into civilian clothes. Also, the scene where the pilot, Wonder Woman and friends are sitting around the campfire before getting to the Western Front; it seemed out of place, like it should've been left in the editing room. Which brings me to the red haired lady, the Scottish sniper and the Indian chief; I found them annoying, like the writers were following standard procedure 'now it's time to introduce friends and allies'. And those sped up/slowed down leaps and kicks; great directors like Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese don't do this. Then there was that heavy metal/guitar music used in 'Batman vs Superman'; I was hoping that since the first half of Wonder Woman was free of this horrible music, it would be left out. And the evil chemist lady who wore a mask concealing part of her face; I reckon the writers got the idea from the 1989 'Batman' film; the Joker's girlfriend had something similar to cover her disfigured face. Wonder Woman had it's moments, for instance the beginning e.g. the Zeus/Aries story (artfully done) and when Diana's growing up and training to become Wonder Woman. And Wonder Woman's island was nice to look at; worth seeing for that, plus the other sets. And the battle scene where Wonder Woman crosses no man's land was good. And Aries's armor looked good, as did the other costumes. You'll probably see Wonder Woman. And it will make/is making lots of money. I think people were expecting Wonder Woman be a silly (like 'Captain America') but it was better than expected. But it wasn't that good either. Technically/production wise Wonder Woman was very good. With a better script, more editing/better pacing; dropping the heavy metal music and those slowed down/sped up fights, Wonder Woman could've been wonderful.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

But one day she starts to rebel and unleashes some hidden powers she was unaware of, meaning the rite of passage has come, so her mother tells her the story of a spiteful son of a God and his attempt to destroy the Earth. Then, Air Force pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash lands into their home, confusing the order of things. He reveals he has a book that contains plans by evil German commandant Ludendorff (Danny Huston) to unleash a deadly nerve gas on England. And so Diana and Steve must head to London to thwart his diabolical plan.The superhero franchise, on both sides of the DC/Marvel divide, must really be doing the rounds, as now we have Wonder Woman, who was a character in the recent disastrous Batman Vs. Superman movie, in her own more than feature length film. And after this, there is of course the Justice League film, where all the main players are having a big jamboree together. Whether this was the inspiration behind this films existence or pressure from the feminist movement to get some good ol' equality up there on the big screen is unclear, but either way the debut feature length directorial effort of Patty Jenkins is a long, joyless effort that wastes a golden chance to level the playing field for female superheroes.Like Batman, even more so, in fact, Wonder Woman has been taken from a pretty camp, light hearted source, and been transformed into something far moodier and deep on the big screen, where undemanding fun has been substituted for wondrous spectacle. But for all the awe inspiring effects and breath taking action sequences, it can't make up for a total sense of humour failure in the script, as well as any care-worthy characters or snappy dialogue, as well as a totally sloppy, incoherent plot that really fails to suck you in for the length it does. She may be beautiful and glamorous to look at, but Gadot isn't the greatest actress, to say the least, and co star Pine is equally vapid and bland. Even a support cast including David Thewlis, Ewen Bremner and Lucy Davis can't help. Performances wise, the best thing is Huston as the villain, who really fits the skin of his character, but can't make the whole thing taste any better.It would have been great to see a good Wonder Woman, but sadly this is just Blunder Woman! *","58 out of 128 found this helpful.

To be honest I have the previous DCU films quite lacking in something.For a comic book film, it actually has a decent story-line, good action scenes but still able to keep the story going in the subdued scenes and had characters you actually cared about, which is more than could be said for the film it followed, Batman v Superman.Will definitely be a movie I would quite happy to pay to see again without hesitation.","11 out of 20 found this helpful.

People actually said it was a perfect movie. Maybe if you're 12. The best thing about this film, the only thing, is Gal Gadot. She has a ton of charisma and is amazing as a warrior princess with the mentality of a three year old. I really think, after having watched this, that the film got high ratings because it was supposed to be the feminist hurrah and it is not PC to rate the first and only feminist comic movie badly. But this movie is LAME. I have enjoyed so many other comic book movies and was looking so forward to this female driven one. Have to say though, right when it started , I had my doubts. They just worsened as the movie progressed. The issues I had with the movie, were a poorly constructed script. Really cheated out there. No big words. But they made the actors act like they were saying big words. Nothing made sense either .. huge plot holes throughout, and especially in wonder woman's origins. That didn't get filled in till the end. But filled in with scraps. The Amazon island - a lesbian paradise filled with all different races , shapes and sizes , butch and femme. Apparently they do not need men to procreate, oh wait, they do, except there is no men and Wonder Woman was sculpted from clay. The island is hidden from everyone except the gods, oh and that spy in an airplane and the German navel command. Secondly ... the acting was pretty wooden which is shocking because of the talent involved. That just means that the script is that bad. My other biggest problem with this movie was that it was just so unbelievable.. not just with actual events , but the characters just seem like caricatures .. I mean I can watch an X Men movie and totally get into it. But for some reason when I see a woman clad in a bathing suit charge across the western front with what must have been hundreds of machines gun shooting at her and only have to dodge three bullets that magically hit her in the bracelets ; it's too much. Just retarded too much. like no way in heck,too much. Other issues? I appreciate diversity just like the next guy. But to have a Native American, and Arab sitting in a bar in England with a Scotsman? During World War 1, no less? Come on. Just too unrealistic and immature ... this is a great movie for teens and kids and tweens and stupid people. I am a big sucker when it comes to ideals and honor - and when Wonder Woman is giving her sermons on the mount about how great mankind is , i literally rolled my eyes. I fast forwarded through most of it just to see the end and find out if there was any god of war. Its that bad. For adults anyways. Just didn't penetrate and didn't feel anything .. the life lessons were dumb too. The entire script seemed written for a third grader. Yeah. Yeah. We all know people suck and we know we aren't going to be better and we are still worth saving kind of thing. Heard it ll before ... like for two thousand years actually. ( hello Jesus) so this was probably the worst comic book movie I've ever seen besides iron man 3. Save your money and rent it for your daughters.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Review: Wonder Woman","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3734282/?ref_=tt_urv","danielgravelli","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur22943443/?ref_=tt_urv","19 June 2017","The film ""Wonder Woman"" presents us the best narrative constructed for DC since the trilogy of Christopher Nolan, revealing to us with fidelity the trajectory of the unbeatable Diana Prince. The princess of the Amazons, the daughter of Queen Hippolyta, was carved from her own clay by the mother, who asked the gods to give her life (a kind of allusion to the Greek myth of Pygmalion). The girl grew up in love with the little world around her, the hidden Themyscira, a Paradise Island populated only by powerful women. Influenced by her aunt, Antiope, she soon became interested in the lives of these warriors, who train tirelessly to prevent a possible return and rule of Ares, the God of war. In order to be the best among them, she constantly trains to help protect the place where she lives. Nevertheless, the arrival of an injured pilot expands the horizons of Diana and she realizes that its fight is well beyond the island. Convinced that she is the right person to prevent possible chaos in the world, even without knowing all the truths, she sets out to confront her great enemy.The production - which features names like Zack Snyder (""300"" and ""Steel Man"") and Rebecca Steel Roven (""Batman - The Dark Knights"") - is a real treat for the fans and a big surprise for the rest of the Because it presents a work that addresses important and current issues, without having to fall into the most of it. With an exceptional work done by the team of practical and visual effects, not abusing the possibilities, the film arrives in a shocking way and puts an end to the discussion that DC does not know how to produce films of superheroes.The script written by Allan Heinberg is very well punctuated. The screenwriter respects the heroine's conception and builds a story with a beautiful dramatic structure, sewing almost perfectly every detail of the narrative. The dialogues, although well elaborated and have a cohesive line of action, become exaggerated at some points in the projection. Something that could be avoided. Patty Jenkins simply breaks through all possible quality barriers with her audacious work on ""Wonder Woman."" His deconstruction of direction is precise and pleasant to see (I would say, to analyze), since his choices of plans dialogue in an authentic, sensitive and fairly balanced way with the plot and the comics. From the brave use of slow motion to precise camera movements, she seeks to leave nothing out of place. Perhaps she misses by releasing an excess of CGI - such as the poorly collated face of the actor who plays Ares, in another person's body and in moments of the fight scenes - but architect a consistent and superior achievement to many other films. The cast is led by the charismatic and talented Gal Gadot, in the skin of the heroine ""Wonder Woman"". The actress is a great find and has been performing well in some of the ""Fast and the Furious"" franchises and various television series. However, it is here that she proves that she has come to stay. It is safe to say that by giving Diana life, she left such a good impression that it would be difficult to replace her with another actress in the future. Chris Pine (""Star Trek""), plays the pilot Steve Trevor and is also very well on the scene. The same can be said of Sa√Ød Taghmaoui, Ewen Bremner and Connie Nielsen, who exhibit strong constructions and psychological gestures that fit their roles. Robin Wright (""House of Cards""), portrays Antiope effortlessly and instigates us with yet another remarkable work. Meanwhile, David Thewlis (""Harry Potter"" franchise) delivers an excellent character to a certain point in the film that leaves something to be desired with forced intonation. Like Danny Huston and Elena Anaya, like the villains Ludendorff and Dr. Maru. At certain times they end up performing a caricature construction, much like the archetypes created for comics. But they were excesses that could easily be left out.Matthew Jensen, responsible for the photography of the great ""Chronicle"" and ""Fantastic Four"", proposes here an elegant harmony of colors. His photography direction deconstructs the various parts of the plot and correctly applies the color palettes that reconcile with each other from start to finish. The warm tones create the atmosphere of Paradise Island, showing the natural and architectural beauties of the place. But the gradations of gray reveal a London divided by the dark side of the war and the colors of the great halls. But the war fields, these are taken by a darkening tonality added to a green filter. A proposal that presents a totally psychological evolution photographic, usually used in films of more dramatic content.""Wonder Woman"" is not only one of the best superhero movies of all time, as it easily goes into gallery of the top ten (or maybe five). It's a consistent, well-developed film and puts DC Comics back on track.","11 out of 20 found this helpful.

My only complain is really the villains, I really felt they were underused and I wish they could have been better. While Wonder Woman doesn't hit the extreme heights of movies like The Dark Knight, is still up there with Iron Man and the original Superman movies, this is one of the best movies DC has done in years and is definitely the best movie in the DCEU, this film reminded why I love DC in the first place.","11 out of 20 found this helpful.

And entertaining it is, as show its box office figures - unless you are one of the following types of reviewer:1. ""Boring"" in the title: we get it, you are a rock star who is secretly a CIA operative, fighting crime, doing high speed pursuits, exploding stuff and killing bad guys with assault rifles. But keep in mind most of us live more mundane lives and thus your incredibly exciting lifestyle can't be used as a reference that's useful to the rest of us.2. ""Insult to your intelligence"" in the title: okay, so you're both a Nobel prize and Oscar winner, we get it. You're so intelligent that to you the rest of us are like a bunch of apes. WE GET IT. Now if you would please let us apes enjoy our monkey movies that we find entertaining, that would be swell, thank you very much. Next time you write a review though, it would be best if you put a disclosure somewhere saying it's only for people with an IQ above 200 or something.3. ""Your hate clich√© here"" in title: lots of reviews giving bad ratings for various different reasons, but interestingly all of them in sequence, effectively burying the good reviews under a number of pages of bad ones. What could this be? An organized bunch of people upset with the success of a movie whose hero is a tall, lean, beautiful Jewish woman who does not hate all males, perhaps? I wonder who these people might be.So to sum things up, if you have an agenda or an ego the size of Connecticut, you're probably not going to like this movie, well, at least not admit to it. But if all you're looking for is an entertaining, heart warming and even uplifting movie, definitely go watch it. On a side note, I have always liked superhero movies because they portrait the decision of an individual who, despite having super powers and being able to use them to do pretty much anything he/she wants, still chooses to use them nobly and for the good of others. Personally I would not trust a person who fails to perceive and appreciate the beauty of that kind of attitude.","17 out of 34 found this helpful.

Gal Gadot really shows impressive dedication to the role.Director Patty Jenkins, who directed Charlize Theron in her legendary depiction of Aileen Wuornos in ""Monster"" (2003), was offered to helm this historic screen adaptation, despite only having one feature film on her r√©sum√©. Apart from some faltering CGI (which, regrettably, seems to have become a standard in blockbusters of late, despite the technical powers at display), there cannot be much negative to say about the craftsmanship. Jenkins and her actors (David Thewlis, not the least) do what they are supposed to. The design is impressive. Rupert Gregson-Williams score is a mighty one. All in all, it's a nice ride. If only we'd not seen the formula used a million times before.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A Breathe of Fresh Air for DC Movies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3741704/?ref_=tt_urv","geekiousmaximus","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur53736696/?ref_=tt_urv","29 June 2017","Perhaps it's clich√© to say at this point, but DC has not released the greatest movies over the past few years. Man of Steel was OK at best, but nothing to write home about. Batman v Superman was pure, sloppy garbage that lacked focus, and Suicide Squad was just one big hot mess. So, naturally, I was very skeptical going into Wonder Woman. I wanted the film to be good, as I want all films I go see to be good, but I had a sinking feeling that this film was going to disappoint me as all the other DCEU films had. I can safely say that my skepticism was proved wrong because Wonder Woman was a fantastic movie.The plot of this film is as follows. A young woman named Diana, played by Gal Gadot, lives on an Island of Amazon Women named Themyscira, which is hidden from the world of men. All is well and good until a man named Steve Trevor, played by Chris Pine, crash lands on Themyscira and tells the Amazons of World War I and the turmoil the world is in. After hearing this, Diana wishes to join Steve and help him fight in the war as she believes the culprit is really Ares, the god of war. The character of Diana, or Wonder Woman, was handled very well in this film. It would have been easy for the writers to simply make her another flawless, perfect Mary-sue that never does anything wrong and defeats all adversity with the greatest of ease. However, they decided instead to give her a sort of child like innocence when confronted with the real world. She still has a lot to learn, and she does make mistakes. However, she still emulates all of the good qualities of humanity that we, the viewers, aspire towards. Actress Gal Gadot was the perfect casting choice for Wonder Woman. Looking back at her career reveals a talent that has been criminally underutilized. Her only big films have been the Fast and Furious movies which have been OK at best and garbage at worst. She also served as an ex-Israeli defense force soldier, which really shines through during the film's action sequences. Watching her dawn the Wonder Woman outfit felt like watching Christopher Reeve dawn the Superman cape, or watching Robert Downey Jr. put on the Iron Man suit for the first time, or watching Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. She is one of those actors that perfectly fits the role. When I looked up on the screen, I didn't see Gal Gadot playing Wonder Woman, I saw Wonder Woman.The film's supporting cast also brings a lot to the film. Chris Pine was an excellent choice for Wonder Woman's Lois Lane, Steve Trevor. He brings some great comedic relief to the film and has some great comedic timing, but he also serves as Diana's anchor, being more of a realist in regards to Wonder Woman's quest. He isn't just some annoying sidekick who has to be saved all the time, he brings some genuine heart to the role and has some great emotional moments as well.While many of the film's leading and supporting roles were handled very well, the film does suffer, as seems standard for many superhero movies these days, from having very poor villains. The film has 2 or 3 villains and none of them really stand out. A couple of them have some pretty cool designs, but it just feels like the standard super- villain we've seen in a multitude of Marvel films. Another major concern I had going into this film was that it was going to be preachy. I was worried that the film was going to pander to the Tumblr Feminist, SJW crowd and hammer in points about men being evil womanizers and women being flawless, perfect beings. I didn't want another Ghostbusters 2016. However, the film was very balanced and level headed with it's message. It empowers women without demonizing men. Not only are the male heroes in the film very warm and likable, but one of the villains, Dr. Poison, is a woman, showing that not only can men be good, but women can be evil. It downplays the gender of the characters and, instead, focuses on their humanity. Wonder Woman was great. It was a fresh new origin film for a DC character we haven't seen on the big screen yet. Gal Gadot was perfect casting for the role of Wonder Woman, and the supporting cast felt very warm and likable. Though the film does have a few flaws, particularly in the villain department, none of the flaws are great enough to drag the movie down. The story is simple and easy to follow, the action scenes are fast paced and exciting, the lead is bad ass but also sympathetic and easy to relate to, and the supporting cast is supportive and enjoyable. The overused cinema tropes, like the sexist ""She's a Woman and can't do blank"" trope and the ""fish out of water"" trope, are addressed during the film, as they should be, but are not used to the point of being annoying. Of the movies DC has released in their new DCEU lineup, Wonder Woman was the first that I've wanted to see more than once. It is also the first of the DCEU movies that I want to add to my Blu-Ray collection. Wonder Woman was great. If you have not seen it yet, go see it ASAP. You will not be disappointed.","14 out of 27 found this helpful.

This movie did not bring anything new to the comic book world or with female empowerment. Wonder Woman ends up being a very bland, vanilla character going through almost no character arc from beginning to end. The realization that she has at the end of the movie, her hero's journey presented to us is as basic and ho-hum as you can get.It has a very basic and predictable plot. The fight scenes are very lackluster and few and far between. Too much slow-mo use with the sparse fight scenes too. Also, this movie has the worst 3rd act climax ever with bad CGI throughout. There was no connection with Ares to Wonder Wonder so you just didn't care for the fight scene at all or what's at stake, because Ares just comes out of nowhere as the ""gotcha"" villain in the final act. There were also no twists in this movie at all so where was all the intrigue? I wanted more mythology.With all that said I still give this movie a 7 which is very generous, there are some stuff that I like about it and I've been waiting for 20 years for this movie. This movie is an overrated mess and I think it did so well because everyone just wants to see Wonder Woman on the big screen and they had a great introduction to the character in Batman Vs. Superman. This is a chick flick superhero movie for sure, which is fine but make it more interesting. I hope the sequel 1984 will blow this movie out of the water.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"6","/10","(ARCHIVE REVIEW) In anticipation of Wonder Woman 2","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5622444/?ref_=tt_urv","TheVictoriousV","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19932818/?ref_=tt_urv","9 April 2020","I am just as astounded as you by all the praise directed toward Wonder Woman. I suppose it makes sense, since the bar for DC Universe installments has been set so low by Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, and the bar for female-led superhero films even lower by the likes of Elektra and Catwoman. Now we have a movie that (A) does well in both categories, (B) constitutes the first proper Wonder Woman feature, and (C) finally puts DC one step ahead of Marvel Studios in letting the ladies take the spotlight of a solo adventure.In many ways, this is a film of triumph. It has given us hope that DC may yet have a chance to turn this ship away from the maelstrom, it has made female fans feel unusually satisfied (there was even a ""women only"" screening, which I would be far more miffed at if there didn't exist ""no girls allowed"" screenings of Logan), and it had a chance to opt for a more Xena-esque tone before it was too late and the only way out would have been tactless re-edits and randomly inserted pop songs.Directed by Patty Jenkins and screenplay penned by Allen Heinberg (who recently worked on an unfinished Wonder Woman TV pilot), the film mainly takes place during World War I. Our heroine Diana (Gal Gadot), an Amazonian demigoddess and the child of Zeus and Queen Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen), saves an undercover US Air Service pilot named Steve (Chris Pine) who crashes near the hidden island where Diana's kin reigns - she hasn't met a man before, it turns out. The island, giving me Lefkada flashbacks, is my favorite design of the film; it is a pity we don't get to stay long.As the Amazons learn of the Great War, as it was called, Diana realizes that war has returned to mankind and that she, despite warnings from her mother, must do that which her people were sent by the gods to do - restore peace. This bit of backstory is told earlier in the film to a young Diana, in a series of animated images that resemble moving Renaissance paintings.We meet more characters. David Thewlis plays a benevolent Imperial War Cabinet speaker, Elena Anaya plays the Germans' aptly nicknamed head chemist ""Dr. Poison"", Robin Wright is an Amazon warrior who tutors Diana, Lucy Davies provides a bit of comic relief I could easily have done without, and Sa√Ød Taghmaoui, Eugene Brave Rock, and Ewen Bremner make up the band of misfits that join Steve and Diana when the British military refuse to help.The film does still have Snyderian dark moments, both in terms of imagery and themes, but it works better here as Diana makes an optimistic drop of color in a grey world. It is fitting, perhaps even timely, that her enemy isn't an evil alien or scheming billionaire, but a personification of war itself in the form of the Greek god Ares - thought to be in the human form of Germany's General Ludendorff (Danny Huston). She is the hero the DC Universe needed, and was denied when Superman was turned mopey and aggressive.To be sure, Zack Snyder was still involved with the story but Heinberg evidently fine-tuned it to the point of comprehensibility and, dare I say, good quality. The film does feature some of Snyder's usual traits, such as the overused slow-motion and the brown-ish balls of fire that never look real, but I attribute this to the fact that Patty Jenkins still had to make the film fit it into the DC Extended Universe in some way.I had other problems. There is a certain twist near the end (which seemed less out-of-the-blue to me than to my theater companions, but I did know it beforehand) that at first seems to give the film a challenging ending but ultimately goes for a more black-and-white conclusion. Also, as genuine as Wonder Woman is in simply giving female fans (in particular) the exhilarating comic-book action film they've craved, there are some less than subtle moments that could have been cut for time at the expense of nothing but a few easy ""amirite"" jokes. I can assure those in doubt: a scene where a superhuman single-handedly obliterates an army of soldiers isn't ""pandering"" just because a woman is doing it.But the film is still very much that; an exhilarating action movie with exciting visuals, and characters you enjoy, admire, and root for. Gal Gadot plays her role much better than she did in Dawn of Justice and she certainly looks the part, even if some aficionados may wish she was taller and burlier. Chris Pine does well as a coward in badass' clothing and both leads are fun in their respective fish-out-of-water situations where they try to comprehend each other's cultures, even if much of it's been done.I can absolutely see why women, including those ""of color"", would feel encouraged by the fact that an Israeli lead, a female director, an age-old role model, and a genuinely good, non-pandering script would take the summer movie season by such storm. It succeeds at being a crowd-pleasing comic-book adventure that nevertheless has a beautiful vision precisely because that vision is not supplied by Zack Snyder or edited beyond coherence, and it succeeds at being a progressive victory precisely because it's not a Sony film and the plot isn't ""what if Superman was a girl?""","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Her portrayal of Wonder Woman is exactly what one expected from the character, and she delivers it with so much style, elegance and beauty, it is almost enigmatic.The plot is pretty straightforward and does a good job of making Wonder Woman shine with all her brevity, ignorance, quirks and dilemmas. Chris Pine, as usual is full of life with his role, and his character complements the plot magnificently with great enthusiasm and hope. Special effects were brilliant, especially the perfectly timed slow- motion slices in the middle of fight sequences. Music is a bit distracting sometimes, but the Wonder Woman theme pumps up the energy levels. Nothing extraordinary has been set up in the movie for the upcoming Justice League team-up, and the movie stands by itself just fine. As an introductory movie of a major character from the franchise, it does a pretty fine job, as it focuses on the back-story of the character rather than jump right into the bandwagon of the 'team of superheroes'.Loved this movie and the shade of social message it tries to impart along with it. Good movie, average movie, bad movie, I was anyway going to watch it for Gal Gadot. God she is awesome. Even a single glance of her makes a man's heart skip a beat. Can't stress more on the fact that I love her. The embodiment of the character she plays on screen - A Wonder Woman indeed. <3 <3 First female director for a comic book movie, and that too for the epitome of female comic book characters - Patty Jenkins makes this movie special and path breaking. Salutes to her.Verdict : A good watch for the weekend complemented by amazing visuals. 3.5/5","10 out of 18 found this helpful.

For a start it feels like a real film, with time to set things up properly, character development and a color pallet that looks like a film rather than a de-saturated computer game. Not unlike Captain America: The First Avenger, this has a period setting that breaths some fresh air into it. Set in World War One, Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot)wants to end the great war and is surrounded by some interesting characters led by Chris Pine (Hell Over High Water) as the love interest. The third act is where it falls apart for me, it feels messy and the support characters are given very little to do. I can imagine a handful of scenarios that would have been more thrilling while sitting on my chuff for five minutes. Still on the whole this is a good adventure and hopefully we will see some good things from the Aquaman movie... I am not holding my breath on the Justice League film.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

To me the meh pretty much sums up the whole wonder woman movie, it's kinda meh. Chris pine to me was great, good comedic timing but you still bought him as a spy and a guy who knew how to fight. The general was also very meh to me. But the problem to me wasn't so much the leads as it was some of the weird plot points, the use of to much slow mo in my opinion and the poor character development for the side characters. The Irish guy had a decent arc but nothing that made me care much about him same with the Indian guy, he was charming and funny but there was no real substance to the character it was like they brought substance to one character and interesting personality to the other. I loved the guy the great sir who played Ares he was amazing and he kinda had shades of gray to him, I think that they could have handled the last act with him a little better because there was not much set up for him turning into the god of war you would expect. That is also another thing that didn't bother me about the movie at all but is something I think could have improved the movie slightly, Greek mythology, I personally love Greek mythology and the terrifically horrible nature of it which I think could have been slightly explored at least. Also the god-killer thing was to me apparent as soon as you saw the mom linger for the sword then went like OK!, her linger was enough for me to get that Diana was the god-killer, like OK she is the only child born and she was sent by Zeus, ofc it is her but they had to beat it over your head for the next 15 min of the movie with Robin wrights death and all. The reveal of her being a god was to me awesome though and the beating it over my head did not in fact ruin that, I thought she could just kill Ares cuz ya know magic or w/e but the god reveal was exciting but also made me even more mad over the fact that superman sacrificed himself like an idiot when wonder woman is literally unkillable except by another god. Random BvS side track aside the movie was just average to me and I don't get the praise it get's. Yes it was a female lead super hero movie but we have had bad ass women lead movies before so I don't see the reason for just this particular one to be so praised.Also I seemed to like the side characters action more than wonder woman's at some points, some of her action scenes were freaking awesome but all of the scenes with the military guys were equally or sometimes even more awesome, maybe it has to do with the fact that they were more relatable or maybe it was just that Patty Jenkins shoots amazing war cinema. And the weird plot points like why when Chris Pine does not let Gal Gadot kill the general does she run outside instead of running towards the general swinging her sword? The whole ball scene was kind off useless to me except to show of Chris Pine's acting skills.TL; DR Wonder woman was to me decent had some good performances some meh and the same goes for the plot and the action some parts where woo F yeah and some were... meh. Definitely not a bad movie but not the great movie it is praised to be","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

For this film is one, woeful pile of garbage (even in the context of a comic book schlock), that should be given a Razzie for its crimes against the filmic medium; not garner ridiculously unwarranted praise.From its horrid casting and barely passable acting (was Gal Gadot away sick during the 'acting module' of her JIDF training tenure?), to its amateurish stunt work and ensuing overuse of CGI effects‚Äïnecessitated in an attempt to futilely smear over the the film's said substandard chop-socky / pew-pew sequences‚ÄïWonder Woman is one of the worst, if not THE worst comic book film I have ever had the displeasure of running afoul of.From go to wow, the film is an aural and visual 'turd de faeces'. There is so little to redeem a film like this, that one must wonder what was going through the minds of those who crafted it: Did they watch the dailies? Did the actors have any input in the creative process, whatsoever? Was it all ""green screened""...? Surely this was all filmed blind... blind drunk, that is!Even for those pushing the film as an empowering vehicle for female actors ‚Äï they have very little to grasp at here. The male ""co-star"" (Chris Pine) is given the bulk of the film's der-dumb dialogue; thus, insultingly relegating the titular character to playing second fiddle. So much so, in fact, that for most part, Gadot's role arguably fails the very 'Bechdel test' the film (and those who champion it) strove to emancipate the yoke of. Of course, this must all be tempered with what the director and screen-writers had at their disposal (with respect to acting clout), which was patently very, very little (*assuming the drivel was not all spouted ad libitum ‚Äï a suggestion not as fanciful as it might normally seem).In short: The dialogue was stilted. The interactions wooden. Obligatory ""love"" sceNE (*singular), ham-fistedly shoehorned and cringe-worthy to bear. Little character development to speak of. Barely a thread of connection was established between viewer and the characters they were meant to invest in. The acting was sub par, at best... A literal failure on every, objective, filmic measure. Even rusted-on Wonder Woman fans would struggle to find tenable arguments for the existence of this film, in the egregious form that it has been rendered.I normally do not write reviews for films of this shabby stock--in any capacity. However, given the hubbub surrounding 'Wonder Woman' and its association with ""the women's movement"", I felt compelled to throw my 2¬¢ worth into this well of bubbling, fetid waste. For I feel we must speak out against blatant shilling for that which patently does not deserve it on merit; and we must fight against the inclination to 'grade on a curve', that has gripped our societies since the advent of the Internet.Moreover, the 'process factory' structure that the industry applies to the production of films in this genre, all but guarantees one schlock after another. These films are clearly produced only to make money. As such ‚Äï given money inherently corrupts all that it comes into contact with ‚Äï the end results are fait accompli. This is not a propitious philosophical model, nor a mindset anyone should advocate for.This race to the bottom, which we are embarked upon, does a disservice, not only to the art form, but also to wider culture and society.Wonder Woman is not the female-helmed comic book film you were looking for. Move on.","33 out of 69 found this helpful.

Later she discovers her true powers and becomes Wonder Woman. Keep in mind she is a Goddess, but she is not aware of that yet. This is what we have been waiting for and it doesn't disappoint. This is terrific Entertainment at its best. Those of us who grew up reading comics of Superman, Batman and others are taken back into believing all this is possible and it is here that we want to believe once again. And so we do.We see a young Diana watching a plane crash in the ocean. She dives in and saves the Pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). With her Amazon sisters she helps defeat the Germans who were after Steve Trevor. Later he tells the community of the war and millions dying because of it. Diana feels she must go and help and defeat Ares (God of War) who she believes is causing all this misery in the world and once he is dead peace will come upon the world. Her mother Antiope (Robin Wright) reluctantly lets her go with Steve Trevor. It was fun seeing Diana experience some of society and learn about it. Steve had promised to take her to the war and eventually they both go. Once at the front all bets are off and Diana goes and does her thing and it is here we see her destroy the enemy. This goes on from time to time defeating the enemy, but the main goal is to find and destroy the building where Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya) also known as Dr poison is making poison gas that will kill millions more. The choreography and CGI is something to behold when Diana goes into action and we never tire of it. They are that good along with the heart rendering music. Kudos. Diana is surprised and disappointed when she kills General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) who she believed was Ares and the war didn't stop.Of course there is a twist in here and you may be surprised about it. We see the real Ares (David Thewlis) show up and he fights Diana to the death. Ares tells Diana that only a God can kill another God and does she have what it takes. These fighting scenes are like something we have rarely or never have seen in other movies. Kudos again.This was a solid production and deserving of all Awards it receives. The acting by all and cinematography were excellent.Kudos to Patty Jenkins who directed this movie. Fantastic job. All in all this was a special treat for we Believers in comic book heroes and we hope to see many sequels in time with the same Gal Gadot who we fell in love with. (yes, I can see that) (10/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.","13 out of 25 found this helpful.

Gal Gadot is the perfect choice for Wonder woman, She showcases all emotions and acted nicely. Similarly, Chris Pine shines as Steve Trevor, their relationship is dynamic and more subtle, and seeing him explaining the world to her is fun. The film deals with thought-provoking themes challenging the good and evil in humanity. The action set pieces are well-staged and entertaining. The cinematography is beautiful, the score is atmospheric, overall production value is excellent. But the CGI is shaky In some places.
Overall, A good origin story for Wonder woman. It's full of action and suspense with strong and likable performances, it's also visually and technically stunning.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Before she became Wonder Woman, she was a trained warrior. A pilot named Steve Trevor(Chris Pine), crash lands on the island of Themyscira. Diana finds out about the war that mankind is waging. She leaves home, decides to fight in the war & embraces her true destiny. Wonder Woman is an awe-inspiring movie. Director Patty Jenkins has done complete justice to this iconic character. The visual effects are spectacular. The action set pieces are mind blowing. All the action scenes, are even more exciting in 3D. The cinematography by Matthew Jensen is gorgeous. Both Themyscira(these portions were shot in Italy) & London look breathtaking. The humor in the film is refreshing, after the lack of humor in previous DC Extended Universe efforts like, Man of Steel(2013) & Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice(2016). I'm so relieved that they didn't mess this up like the previous two female-led superhero outings, Catwoman(2004) & Elektra(2005). This movie is picture perfect, right from the first scene till the last scene. Gal Gadot is outstanding as Diana. Gadot steals the show with her masterful portrayal, of the most famous female superhero in the world. Chris Pine is brilliant as Steve Trevor. Connie Nielsen is excellent as Hippolyta. Robin Wright is fantastic as Antiope. Danny Huston is impressive as Ludendorff. David Thewlis is superb as Sir Patrick. Said Taghmaoui, Ewen Bremner, Eugene Brave Rock & Lucy Davis are awesome as Sameer, Charlie, The Chief & Etta, respectively. Elena Anaya is amazing as Dr. Maru. Lilly Aspell is adorable as Young Diana(8). Wonder Woman is a must watch for everyone. Go & celebrate this wonder of a woman! I'm waiting with bated breath for Justice League(2017).","30 out of 67 found this helpful.

After we had witnessed the critical duds like Suicide Squad and BVS, we now have a film that will be truly known as the first great DCEU movie. Let me get you into the details without spoilers.Entertainment factor. The movie's greatest strength for me is in its humor and it didn't bore us like the last DCEU films. Action scenes were great with no hiccups. Editing was an improvement also from the previous DC films. Thank God. Production value. You could tell they really took the time even if the budget is much lower than a typical Marvel movie. Costumes and the film locations were chosen wisely. From the sandy beaches of Diana's homeland, Victorian London, to the grittiness of a WW1 battlefield.CGI. Much of the movie were made with practical effects but some scenes are with a green screen background. Some of the CGi were unconvincing but tolerable throughout the movie. No complaints though.Acting. Is good, everyone played their part like they were meant to be but no Oscar-worthy roles. Gadot's performance and role as the Amazonian princess definitely perfect albeit her acting needs more polishing. Chris Pine felt natural in his role as usual. Supporting characters were also noteworthy in their roles.Overall an entertaining ride from start to finish. Definitely recommend. 8.5/10","18 out of 37 found this helpful.

I want to rate this even higher for the parts I like, even for the opening on Themyscyra (sic) because I bought in even more to the emotion of how it was played so straight by the actors and staged by Jenkins. Gal Gadot is the new Christopher Reeve, and in her own way even more badass because of how much she makes Diana a force to be reckoned with while keeping so much vulnerability just under the surface. She and Chris Pine are a wonderful 30's or 40's rom com couple, though more adorable due to Diana's mix of awkwardness and strength, often in the same breath..... But that climax is still not impressive on a technical level. I don't even mean how the conflict has to come to a head, I get all of that, and I even liked the I BELIEVE IN A THING CALLED LOVE (cue guitar lick) moment because Jenkins is not only not afraid of cheese she doesn't know what the word means, but it connects with the key theme of the movie. I know so many of the final battle scenes or fights that happen with these comic book movies have been called bullshit but a) there were less than zero stakes because (Spoiler) we know Wonder Woman doesn't succumb to evil because of her appearance in the previous DC movie that takes place 100 years after this one (and I so wish it didn't exist due to the continuity errors it places with this), and b) the CGI is laughable, with David Thewlis (who you ALL owe it to yourselves to see on Fargo s.3) not being good at turning total evil HAM.So in short: the parts I liked before I liked a little or a lot more (the 'No Man's Land' is the one part, mostly when Diana first appears, that, just iconography-wise, is cool), and the parts I didn't I felt so, so, so embarrassed. Hence this review and half a star bump. It's also the best DC comic book movie since Batman Begins. So there.","9 out of 16 found this helpful.

When a pilot crashes and tells of conflict in the outside world, she leaves home to fight a war to end all wars, discovering her full powers and true destiny. (12A cert; 141 mins)The DC Extended Universe (DCEU) is now in full swing. We've seen Superman take flight, Batman battling evil in Gotham, and the Suicide Squad fighting the bad with bad. Now, it's time to welcome a new hero; Wonder Woman.Patty Jenkins has received a lot of praise from fans and critics alike as Wonder Woman takes the world by storm. It's clear why; she's a very talented director and skilled within the action genre. Some of the action sequences are wonderfully captured, it's easy to follow and smooth in the edit. She understands the characters and directs the two leads well. Unfortunately, that's where the good stuff ends.Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are both incredible in their respective roles. Their writing is realistic, you care for them both, truly. However, the screenplay is just as bland as the other DCEU entries. It's funny and inviting, but as the film progresses in its slow pace, the layers start to uncover, revealing its generic story and predictable outcome. Gadot's Wonder Woman is fierce, bold, beautiful. She and Pine are the saving grace, that goes without saying, but the overdose of CGI and the exaggerated yet anti-climatic finale left me feeling empty.That said, it is without a doubt the best DCEU instalment yet, in terms of production and performances. The WWI setting is gritty and dark, as it should be. We get to see how Diana reacts to the evils of war and that was a really nice direction. We see her vulnerable, but we also see her stronger than ever. You'll leave the theatre thinking about one scene in particular; No Man's Land. It's beautifully crafted with some goosebump-worthy moments. I'm sure it'll go down as one of the most memorable scenes in DCEU history.Rupert Gregson-Williams' original score is powerfully moving. There's a moment where Tina Guo skilfully performs Hans Zimmer's kick-ass Wonder Woman theme in one of the most rewarding fights I've seen. Rupert's music is action-packed, but it's the grounded connection between Diana and Steve where he truly delivers. It's a delightful score and functionally superb.It's not a bad film, it's still enjoyable as a stand-alone Wonder Woman epic. Just don't go ahead with high expectations, you'll more than likely leave disappointed. Perhaps I expected too much, given the flooding positive response. There's a lot that could have gone wrong, making it as lacklustre as BvS and Suicide Squad, but it stood up and at least tried to tell a unique and fulfilling story. Above all else, the evolution of Gadot's Wonder Woman is inspiring to watch.Verdict; Gal Gadot & Chris Pine are both wonderful and deliver some truly beautiful moments, but the story lacks momentum, suffering pacing issues and becoming just as tedious as the other DCEU entries.Wonder Woman ‚Äì ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (6/10)","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is one of the best casting choice i see along side with Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man.Seriously Gal kick ass from start to end with many fun and awesome action scene that i can clearly see that she had to put a lot of hard work in.Knowing it a woman empowerment movie but the guys character in this movie is not that bad either.They funny,likable and some scene involving the romantic relationship between Gal Gadot and Chris Pine that add a lot of emotion into the movie and make it more memorable.I guess the reason why i can't rate this movie 10 starts cause it suffer the same issues as other superheroes movie like genetic plot and weak villain but again this is the first DC movie that i truly enjoy for a long time so i recommend it for everyone","15 out of 30 found this helpful.

Breathtaking (I'm warning you guys, it's true! Gal Gadot as Diana sets the ultimate standard of the perfect heroine - in beauty, fierceness and heart)! Believable (in its mythical way)!I've seen numerous other super-hero movies (though I missed Superman vs Batman and think I'm glad for it, to have first discovered Wonder Woman in this primary story) but this one is on a whole other class and level. Never has a hero or heroine been elevated to such a level of purity and perfection ¬Ö which is all the more staggering that: never has a super-hero been as believable as this one. Phenomenal! Talk about buy-in: from the opening scene I was totally immersed and lost in the story ¬Ö and what a trip it was!The film-makers (all of them, all together) have made Wonder Woman come to life - in Diana! Ingenious setting and background; spectacular heroine; beautiful film-making, stunts and visual effects (this really is one to see in the best 3D you have access to). I cannot wait for the next Wonder Woman movie! I will watch everything they can throw at us - provided they can somehow keep the standard and integrity of this monumental movie!This is one of those movies that changes everything moving forward; iconic; a reference point, of which there have only been a handful in my lifetime. So I would have to rate this as one of the most amazing movies I have experienced. Go see for yourself - in big screen for the first time you watch it, and in 3D if possible! My only regret is not to have seen it in IMAX 3D! Much praise to all the film-making team for this gem.","17 out of 35 found this helpful.

Without the comparison I was already disappointed in Wonder Woman; but after watching a Marvel film, the difference was all the more evident.Wonder Woman starts with a link to the modern attempt at a franchise before jumping back to an origin story. It is a simple affair in terms of setting up one main villain, and letting it play out. It does have some interesting and brave aspects to it, and I appreciated what it did in terms of the male lead and the ultimate villain, but there was a lot of baggy material around it. The supporting characters offer color but the film itself doesn't seem to spark. It is too earnest for the most part, and never gives the audience permission to enjoy it as a piece of entertainment (something that Marvel does well). The action sequences suffer from being too obviously CGI in nature, and some of the effects are surprisingly weak - in some moments it already looks dated and it has not been out that long.The cast are good though, and deserve more. Gadot is much more effective on the promotional appearances than she is here. At times she is limited by her range, at others she is limited by the material. Pine is good throughout but not much more than a twinkle and good humor in terms of character. Thewlis, Huston, Bremner, and others all add quality to the cast but there is not always the material there for them. Like all the superhero films, it ends up with two special effects hitting each other surrounded by lots of CGI destruction; but what matters is what it does outside of that and leading up to it. In the case of Wonder Woman, it doesn't do enough, and takes too long to do it.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

If I start detail analysis of everything wrong with it I'll spend half a day on bashing and I have o go to work in half an hour. First, this is school example of lazy screenwriting. The story is dumb linear, full of holes and illogicalities and characters are terribly developed, without any background or evolution during the movie, which is unacceptable for an origin story. Gal Gadot is perfect for the role, but her acting is artificial and it looks like she poses for every scene. Like if the accent isn't on portraying WW character in the best possible way, but they want to decoy us and draw our attention from bad movie to Gal's unbelievable beauty and skills. Amount of slow motion in action scenes is so excessive that after some time it goes from ridiculous to tragic. I had a feeling like I'm watching ballet adaptation of comic-book on Fashion channel. Special effects are not bad, but it could be done better and more convincing. This looks more like animated than a feature film. Also, in some scenes, it is more than obvious they violently refrained from natural development of the scene only to stay within PG-13 at any cost. If I go into details I could do this for hours. And then again, Gal Gadot is magical, hypnotizing. There are some beautiful scenes and few funny moments. Although I could list its flaws for hours and I have almost no compliments for this movie, I really enjoyed watching it. Briefly, catastrophe, but really entertaining one.7/10Objectively, I would give it 5/10, but it would be hypocritical to rate so low movie that I will most probably watch again. Cause, in spite of its flaws I liked it pretty much.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Finally is arrived! Finally is arrived a top level female superhero (I will not use the term super-heroine for obvious reasons), Wonder Woman is here! Diana does not have anything less than her male ""colleagues"", she is capable to kick your ass twice and do it again, she does not belong to any team and she is a one-woman slaughterhouse, or at least very close to that.Diana's character has been revised and corrected compared to the ""naive"" character of the '70s TV series interpreted by Lynda Carter. Diana is definitively in step with the times and Gal Gadot's interpretation is a high level one, brava!In its entirety the movie hold the line very well and I did like it a lot, I recommend it (for what you can care about)... but there is something that keep me perplexed and lead me to some questions. Why Captain Steve does not drive the plane to open water where he could have had avoid the explosion and could have saved his life? Why a ducking idiot as Goblin can make it every time and Ares in person, or in divinity, seems to be gone after the first appearance in a movie? ... The idea of an Ares dumber than Goblin keep me even more perplex but let's move on. Why insert in the screenplay a Turkish man among the ""heroes""? Has it been made to balance the presence of the Ottoman Empire among the ""villains""? Why to save just them from a bad reputation? And the most important, why all superheroes persecute Germans? Why the duck a German soldier of the World War I shall be considered a member of the forces of evil when the English has to be considered the good guy? After Captain America endeavor in Germany I hoped that the ""bullying"" against Germans would come to an end but, ta-da, Wonder Woman just arrived and killed the fathers to the soldier killed by the puny New Yorker under doping drugs.Yes, it is fiction, it is for fun, but stop it now, please. Too much is too much. I am quite scared that a day California would become independent, you never know if the high military command in Hollywood would declare war to Germany and will send Wonder Woman in Berlin, Captain America in Munich and Superman in Frankfurt... Californian screenwriters, limit yourselves a bit, and more, wasn't America first the motto of that guy that you did not like that much?In this moment I offer all the solidarity I can express to the Germans, without superheroes in the enemy army, they would never ever lose those ducking wars!(original article at www.principesblog.com/superheroes-also-women-against-the-Germans/)","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

"7","/10","Great movie with good casting but bad plot (SPOILER ALERT)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3757507/?ref_=tt_urv","alexanderlchen","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur53750577/?ref_=tt_urv","18 July 2017","As much as I liked the movie, I did think that the movie lacked substance in the story/plot and in character development. When we first see Diana as a child, we learn that she wants to learn how to fight and loves to fight. We don't see this in the context of a moral crusade or a belief of helping other's in the movie which leads me to ask the question, does Wonder Woman love the people she is fighting to save or does she innately love fighting? Adding some context in those childhood scenes of seeing her use fighting as a last resort to help another person I think would have been more powerful/effective in her character development. Second, I thought the movie tried to evoke emotions that it had not devoted time investing in. For example, when the village at the end is bombed with the gas and everyone dies in it, we know no one in the village so we, as an audience, are tempted not to care. Adding a scene where we see the humanity and life of the village (a few montage shots to allow us to empathize and care about the villagers) or the introduction of a few villagers whom we feel we know intimately changes the story from a bombed village to the loss of good people. I did love the investment and development of the two main characters, Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor. The buildup of the relationship between Steve and Wonder Woman makes that last scene so wrenching because we actually care about Steve and see his good heart and selflessness. We don't get that kind of emotional investment in the villagers so it isn't a sacrifice that evokes the same amount of emotion. Lastly, I think DC needs to make better villains because I was able to figure out who Ares was early on in the movie. I like the added dimensionality that Ares brings but I felt that his character portrayal, introduction, and impact on the store could have been much improved. I personally felt as though leading us to believe the German commander was Ares was a bit cheesy and needed some modification too. I think casting for this movie was fantastic and my biggest qualms with DC movies isn't the casting but rather the sub par story-telling and plot. I'm starting to see a trend with DC movies and in my opinion, the biggest weaknesses are the villains (lack of depth), great casting with bad plots/stories, and lack of emotional investment (i.e. the people Amanda Waller kills in Suicide Squad or the villagers in Wonder Woman).","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

However, it is no where near as complex or thought provoking as man of steel or bvs. It is way better than that superficial piece of pandering garbage suicide squad which was neither emotional or thought provokingThis isn't surprising since most mainstream audiences didn't understand those movies which forced dc to do something more straight forward with this movie. The funny thing is that I see people are still complaining about it not having humor or character development even though the movie clearly has both of those things. Unfortunately, these people are so blind with their hate toward the dceu that they won't watch any more movies the franchise puts out. I find this funny considering that the only good mcu movie before the avengers was iron man. The rest were garbage yet you all stuck around. Oh and I don't care if this review offends people. I'm tired of not being able to voice my opinion without getting a ton of hate for it. Marvel has ruined the movie industry with their formulaic generic and safe movies.

"8","/10","The DCEU goes back to basics and it works wonders.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3721407/?ref_=tt_urv","joshbarton15","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur18544553/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2017","As a character, Wonder Woman has been around since 1941, which makes it even more crazy to think that she has never had her own film released in cinemas. That is, until now. The fourth film of the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), which has been pretty lacklustre so far, Wonder Woman is a film that couldn't come at a more relevant time.When American pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes on the island of Themyscira, he meets Diana (Gal Gadot), an Amazonian princess and trained warrior. Upon hearing of the horrors of World War I, Diana leaves her home to fight in the war to end all wars, where she realises her full potential and becomes Wonder Woman.The DCEU has certainly shown ambition in its short lifespan but each and every one of Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad were weighed down with either destruction porn, convoluted narratives or just plain old bad filmmaking. With Wonder Woman, Patty Jenkins, who just so happens to be the first female to direct a big-budget superhero film, goes back to basics and it truly does work wonders for the DCEU.Jenkins hasn't made a film since Monster back in 2003, which is astonishing considering how good that film is, yet it feels as if she's been an avid filmmaker since then with just how confidently she unleashes the titular Wonder Woman upon the world. Delivering a basic yet inspiring origin story, Wonder Woman is a film that does justice to such an iconic character, ensuring she remains an empowering female character and role model.Wonder Woman really does feel like a classic adventure film, where the action sequences drive the film forward however, they do so without sacrificing the narrative. Diana's origin story from her younger years on Themyscira through to her realisation of how horrific mankind can be to one another through fighting in World War I makes for such impactful viewing, Allan Heinberg's screenplay making the audience feel empathy towards Diana.Heinberg also ensures that we are watching a film based on a comic book with some delightfully funny moments between the film's characters. Seriously, I was taken aback by just how funny Wonder Woman actually ended up being, considering how dark and serious most the DCEU has been previously. The action sequences, particularly the No Man's Land sequence, are so powerful and thrilling, Diana's emotions pouring out through the majority of them, making for a film the audience can connect with more.Coming to the performances, Wonder Woman features a lead performance from Gal Gadot that certainly blew away any skepticism I had about her going in to the film. A lot was made of her appearance in Batman v Superman however, now is the right time to properly judge her in the role and she does an amazing job as Wonder Woman. She's powerful when she has to be and wonderfully funny with a fish-out-of-water demeanour akin to the one seen in Thor. I was most impressed with how effectively Gadot displays the naivety and innocence of Diana when it comes to the war, one particular moment making for one of the more emotional moments in a superhero film of recent years.Chris Pine makes for a great partner for Gadot to share the screen with as Steve Trevor, who Pine plays with a bit of the cockiness we've seen him play Kirk in Star Trek with. The chemistry between the pair makes the love story that plays a major part in the narrative feel much more natural to watch. The rest of the cast, rather disappointingly, felt a little underwhelming, particularly Danny Huston as yet another forgettable villain of a superhero film, and Robin Wright, who gets nowhere near the amount of screen time I was hoping for.2017 has been a great year for superhero films so far and Wonder Woman ensures that the trend continues, Gal Gadot and Patty Jenkins sharing a working relationship full of passion to deliver a fantastic adventure for such an important character. Wonder Woman is a massive step in the right direction for both the DCEU and women in film.","11 out of 21 found this helpful.

It's not a secret that there was a lot riding on this film. Some people even went as far as to say that if this movie didn't succeed, the future of DC's live action movies may be up in the air. Well, good news; not only is Wonder Woman a great movie, it's one of the best super hero movies I've seen in quite a while.PlotWonder Woman follows the story of Princess Diana, who lives on the remote (and hidden) island of Themyscira. But one day, a plane penetrates the shield that hides the island from the rest of the world and crashes into the water. Diana rescues the man, and thus it is inevitable that she will visit the world of men (aka London). Also, obviously, she will kick some serious ass.I gotta say, Wonder Woman's story is one of the most well-rounded super hero stories I've watched in a while. It's intriguing in the beginning, but once the action starts you are locked in for quite a ride. There's emotion, humor, and of course there's a lot of action. I would say that Wonder Woman suffers from the super hero movie syndrome, which is basically where the story follows the origin, conflict, boss fight formula. But we do have to take into account that this is the first Wonder Woman movie, ever. That's pretty crazy when you think about it, and because of that I'm perfectly fine with Wonder Woman following the standard formula. Audiences need to be properly introduced to the character, learn to care for the character, and obviously see her kick some serious ass. It makes sense and it works well.It's not going to go down as one of the best stories in history, or even of the year, but it's still a fantastic super hero story.ScriptThe script for Wonder Woman is fantastic. There are no scenes that drag on longer than they should. The longer conversations have a purpose, and the shorter conversations aren't clunky or awkward. There's also a lot of witty humor throughout which makes the movie much, much more enjoyable.Allan Heinberg did a great job writing this movie.CharactersWonder Woman is the focus of this movie, who woulda expected that? So, as you might expect, if she doesn't win over the audience then the movie isn't gonna be all that great. Well, good news: Wonder Woman is great in Wonder Woman. She's likable, intelligent, and surprise, surprise...she can kill lots of dudes.Steve Trevor is also incredibly likable and pretty funny. He is exactly what he needs to be for this movie, and while he's not the main focus he does help the story along in a big way.The rest of the characters are secondary/background for the most part (besides the villain which I won't get into). They're all great, though, and help the movie excel to the level it does.Potential AudienceWhile I wouldn't take my five year-old kid to see this movie, I would take anyone above the age of 12 to see Wonder Woman. This is a movie that can appeal to everyone. Old men? Yes. Old women? Yes? Middle- aged? You betcha. Millennial? Hell yeah.If you enjoy a movie that has a good story and a fair bit of action, you'll walk out of the theater satisfied.ConclusionWonder Woman is the first major critical success of Warner Brothers' new DC universe, and I hope that it is not the last. It's exactly what we were all hoping it would be. Furthermore, it's exactly what it needed it to be.Heck, I'll be going to see it again soon, and I'll be buying it on Blu-Ray later this year. It was that good.Oh yeah, if it isn't obvious already, I definitely think that you should go see this movie. You won't be disappointed.","11 out of 21 found this helpful.

Camera movement are very dynamics and slow motion is placed at the right moment.Movie is setted during the First World War. Diana is forced to see the cruelty of the it. She is a fighter in every sense, not only with her superpowers, but also with words: she always argue with humans about injustices of the world, but the only one that really understand her is Steve. The chemistry between the two is amazing, and their relationship will have many beautiful and funny moments.The main issue with the movie is the ending: after many wonderfully conceived scenes, with the perfect mix between CGI and stunts actions, the movie finishes with the classic boss fight, that we are already used to see in a Marvel movie and that was, personally speaking, completely unsettling. I was waiting for something different, but in the end director decided to play safe. After watching Shazam!, I think that the DC Extended Universe has a lot of potential, but as we already know through the years, it had many difficulties to rise, Marvel has definitely more experience, but it tends to create always those empty and repetitive movies, while DC, at least for me, has more beautiful stories. They just need to understand how to develop something that really differs and I think that with Joker (2019), they are finally going in the right direction.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A ""Wonderful"" ""Wonder Woman""","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3721920/?ref_=tt_urv","dee.reid","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur0892646/?ref_=tt_urv","2 June 2017","To say that 2017's ""Wonder Woman"" is the best DC Comics film I've seen since probably ""The Dark Knight"" in 2008 is indicative, I think, of how far DC Comics has lagged behind Marvel Comics in terms of bringing their superheroes to the big screen. But DC Comics did have one ace up its sleeve, in that Wonder Woman, the first widely recognizable super-heroine in the history of comic books, would ALSO have the potential to be the first super-heroine to launch her own truly successful movie franchise. (The first female superhero franchise would have been the ""Daredevil"" spin-off ""Elektra"" in 2005, but that film failed to launch such a movie franchise.)To that end, DC Comics has largely succeeded with ""Wonder Woman,"" a film that breaks with past DC movie titles in the fact that it's headlined by a female lead and - most important for this viewer (and, borrowing the words of another commenter) - it has a finer balance of action and levity, and the latter seems to arise naturally from the material and doesn't feel forced. Marvel has succeeded in that regard to make their films more entertaining - even if every other line in one of their films now ends in a punchline.But, I digress.Wonder Woman, who was created by American psychologist William Moulton Marston (the man responsible for creating the polygraph machine) and inspired by his wife Elizabeth and their mutual live-in lover Olive Byrne - and who first appeared in ""All Star Comics #8"" - is a character I have an unusual relationship with.I'm 31, going on 32. And I'm a guy. Growing up, I had always heard about Wonder Woman, but did not actually become a fan of the character until about five years ago, and that was by way of the Lynda Carter TV series ""Wonder Woman"" from the 1970s. I still believe Carter to be the ultimate Wonder Woman - in spite of that show's inherent '70s cheesiness - but this big-screen 2017 film adaptation may prove that that version of the character has been formally relegated to the rapidly changed times. Wonder Woman was also not the first female superhero I encountered growing up - I believe it was Storm of the X-Men, from Marvel - but she was still the most widely recognized character that I was aware of growing up. Watching the Lynda Carter TV series, I thought it was amazing to see such a positive central portrayal of a female superhero that I hadn't seen yet in television or film.""Wonder Woman"" is a film that I had high expectations for, and those expectations were largely met. ""Wonder Woman"" isn't your typical origin story, either - being that this version of the character first appeared in ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016) last year. The film also doesn't waste a lot of time obsessing over every little detail, and waste precious screen-time, of how young Diana (Lilly Aspell), an Amazonian princess, eventually grows up into the beautiful Diana Prince (Israeli model and actress Gal Gadot). She already is Wonder Woman; she just has to learn to be the person that she was destined to be and realize her purpose in this world as a super-heroine.When American U.S. Army intelligence operative Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash-lands his World War I plane in the waters just off Diana's beautiful island of Themyscira, he enlists her to return to Man's World to help him deliver a stolen notebook containing valuable information on a new chemical super-weapon that the Germans are developing (mustard gas). Along with Diana, Steve recruits three friends - secret agent Sameer (Said Taghmaoui), Scottish sharpshooter Charlie (Ewen Bremner, Spud from ""Trainspotting,"" who also serves as this film's comic relief), and the Native-American expatriate The Chief (Eugene Brave Rock) - to help them accomplish their mission and stop the war-mongering German commandant General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) from going forth with his plans to launch a mustard gas attack on nearby London.Directed by Patty Jenkins, ""Wonder Woman"" has the distinction of being only the SECOND superhero film with a woman at the helm - after German director Lexi Alexander (""Punisher: War Zone"" in 2008). It would seem appropriate, I suppose, that such a groundbreaking character could only be done proper cinematic justice by a female director, and Patty Jenkins is quite the competent one here. Gal Gadot, who like all able-bodied Israeli citizens, served two years in the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), and I would hazard a guess that her military background certainly helped in getting her the part to play Wonder Woman. She's a tough and formidable presence on the screen and plays the character remarkably well (she definitely IS this version of Wonder Woman) - but again, I still favor Lynda Carter as the DEFINITIVE Wonder Woman.If ""Wonder Woman"" suffers from any problems, it's in the action sequences. As someone else here pointed out, ""Wonder Woman"" suffers from the same slow-motion, gravity-defying CGI effects first pioneered by ""The Matrix"" (1999) and was way, WAY overdone in its two sequels. I honestly felt like I was watching ""The Matrix Reloaded"" (2003) and ""The Matrix Revolutions"" (2003) all over again, and I thought that Hollywood had grown out of its ""Matrix"" obsession years ago - and yet it seems like it's coming back. You could find an excuse in the fact that it's a comic book superhero film - but still, it's very jarring and can tend to slow action scenes down. Yeah, it looks cool and all, but sometimes it can be overdone and hamper your overall enjoyment of the picture in these places.""Wonder Woman"" was a solidly entertaining, if imperfect, big-screen debut solo outing for such a groundbreaking character and comic book property. Now, I honestly can't wait to see a sequel where Wonder Woman is saving the world in modern times.A ""Wonderful"" ""Wonder Woman,"" indeed.8/10","11 out of 21 found this helpful.

I also thought that the origin and development of her birth and rise would have been more dynamic and have more detail to it.

You may painfully recall last year's Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. The only bright spot in an otherwise excruciating film was the introduction of Gal Gadot's Diana aka Wonder Woman. She walked away with the movie's best scenes set to that killer theme tune. I, like many others, was looking forward to Wonder Woman's solo film and boy does it deliver!Why did it take so long for a female superhero to get the spotlight in today's era of superhero movies? Because our society isn't quite as evolved as some would have you believe. But no matter. If the long wait results in Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman being made, I say the wait was worth it. Ms. Jenkins skillfully blends action, humor, and heart to create a character that shines brighter than any hero I've seen on celluloid in recent memory. Her star kicks the villain's ass while she lets the patriarchy have it. Hats off, Madam Director.The story revolves around Diana, an Amazonian Princess, who has been raised on an island far from the rest of the world but when she rescues a pilot from a plane crash she gets to know about the outside world and how men have brought it to its knees with war and destruction. Unable to stand idly by Diana embarks on a destiny defining mission to rescue man from all that is evil. This isn't a short film, as the genre doesn't allow it, but it's well thought out and smartly paced. Action, drama, and humor are all well executed and come up at appropriate times. The visuals and background score are stunning. But more than anything, it's the heart and soul of the main character that keeps you glued to your seat.Gal Gadot has a sparkling presence. She infuses Diana with kindness and strength in equal doses. Her screams echo in the theatre and the charm in her eyes makes it difficult for you to look away. It's the best cast DC role since Heath Ledger's Joker. Chris Pine delights as Steve Trevor, Diana's companion and guide to the new world. He's genuine and lends a hand (or shoulder) to his costar who doesn't often need it. David Thewlis (who I can only remember as Lupin from Harry Potter) is effective and does well in a relatively short part.Wonder Woman is a glorious manifestation of hope, love, and the power of good. While the character is never called 'Wonder Woman', the movie is indeed wonderful. Patty Jenkins has done complete justice to a character that will live in our hearts for a long time.

Wonder Woman was very good. I'm keeping it vague not to spoil it for anyone. The story was told nicely from the very beginning. Gal did a really nice job. The ending is a bit all over the place but you wind up being forgiving because the movie until that point was done very well. I hope DC learns from that. I rated it a 9 because I couldn't do 8.5 Stars. I could've done 8 but cut DC a break for what seems to be learning from past mistakes|missteps. I would've given it a 10 if the ending wasn't all over the place. I'm also taking into consideration that this is the introduction of Wonder Woman. I'm sure Lynda Carter is proud. As the Wonder Woman introduction into the Modern Super Hero | Heroine Universe this will not disappoint at all. Looking forward to better things from DC and really hope they learn from any mistakes they make. I'm more of a Marvel guy - but I Absolutely Love Wonder Woman. I also root for amazing Comic Book Movies no matter who they are from.","11 out of 21 found this helpful.

Actions are done wonderfully and you can feel some of the elements of Zack Snyder in the movie. There are many heroic and epic scenes in the film that will definitely be remembered for the year to come. Music is done beautifully as well. DC always has a knack for producing great music and this one is not an exception. If you want a movie with heart, some humor, great action this will definitely be the movie for you to watch this June.","13 out of 26 found this helpful.

For the most part that's what I got. Unfortunately for most of the movie it felt like Diana was just acting like a stubborn teenager that knows better than everyone else, ignoring even seemingly simple requests by her supposed partner in action. I get that some of this may have been on purpose to show her naivety to how this world behaves or her vigor to help make a positive difference or the idea that I don't need a man to tell me what to do, or maybe just played for comedic effect to some extent. I don't know. But it just put me off a little. Like this guy is clearly trying to help, can you just listen to him for one second? Also really played up the romance angle more than I expected for what I thought was supposed to showcase the strong independent woman. By the end of the film she seems to have grown and hopefully will be less irritating in the future. Rant finished. Overall I thought it had good story, acting, action and effects.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It is very well written, edited, and directed. Patty Jenkins gives the audience an adventure they will never forget. Unlike other DC Movies, it is not slow, or just filled with action, but has the perfect combination of comedy, romance, and adventure. Gal Gadot is breathtaking. She perfectly delivers the innocence of Diana and her difficult journey as she finds out how cruel human beings can be. Another great thing about the movie is the partnership between Diana and Steve. The teammates trust each other and help each other out, knowing they are both capable of doing the same things. Steve trusts Diana's instincts, and is afraid she might get overwhelmed with how different the world is. Whilst Diana struggles to understand his emotions and his constant desire to protect her. The chemistry between the actors is obvious, and their journey together is worth watching. But, the most important thing is the lesson of the movie. We live in a world were most superheroes are male. Women are either sidekicks or damsels in distress. The world is changing, and Wonder Woman shows the younger generations that girls can also be heroes. Definitely my favorite movie of the year!

I don't know? That was great, Henry Cavill is sooo hot!).I do have a lot of faults to pick with it however. For example: If Wonder Woman is not only the titular character, but also the lead part, why did it still feel like a Chris Pine film, once he arrived on screen?I did like the bad ass fighting women and the smooth moves they had, but maybe the beginning was a bit long, as we don't really get to see Wonder Woman as we know her until about 71 Minutes in (Thank you IMDB Trivia).Overall, it doesn't really have that impressive story and is quite simple with a little bit of excitement towards the end, but there are some elements that are well thought out. I especially liked the use of old art to depict the story she was told as a child and the fights were all very well choreographed.What I didn't like, was the choice of actor for Ares, God Of War. A bit northern for my tastes perhaps? I would probably have chosen a younger actor, aged him up to start and then revealed him as a young muscled God at the end.Also, I'm assuming that the Native American Guy is true to the comics, but as a Marvel reader, I have no idea if he is right or not. I do think from a film goers perspective that he was just a bit odd, but then I suppose the guy in the kilt was too?I adore Chris Pine and he does a good job here, even if there is definitely some Captain Kirk there, but I think that Gal should have had more presence and the story should have shown her as a leader from the start.Hopefully the films that follow on from here will give her the glory she deserves. After all, the girls got skills man!
I am actually looking forward to a DC film for the first time ever I think, as I wait for 'WW 1984' to come on TV. I'm not that enthused that I'll buy it on DVD though.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I believe all humans should receive equal rights but do not fight for them in any way, so don't call me a femenist. That said, this movie is freaking awesome. People say it empowers women but I think it empowers us as a species. I've liked every DCEU movie up until this point(yes, even Suicide Squad') but this is the only one that I consider has rivalled Marvel's standard. Gal Gadot gives the best performance of her career as Wonder Woman and commands this movie. Chris Pine plays his role perfectly as Steve Trevor and the chemistry between the two is very convincing and entertaining. The story is also pretty good and informs the audience all about Wonder Woman, and her past. Both I and the person whom I watched this movie with knew little about the character going in and are both now well educated on the character. Not to say this movie is without flaws. I will definitely say that the climax of this movie is very messy and could have been controlled a lot better and cleaner. They also try to trick the audience throughout the movie but anyone with a brain can figure out how it's going to go. I won't spoil it for you but I image you'll be able to figure it out.This is a very good looking movie and the overwhelming majority of the action was handled really well. There is a sequence towards the middle of this movie where I wanted to stand up in the cinema and cheer because it was just that good. The CGI was also very well handled, again with the exception of the climax where it became overused and bloated. The supporting cast, from Ewen Bremmer's Scottish Charlie to Elena Anaya's creepy Doctor Poison, did a convincing job and served their role to the story. That is to say with the exception of David Thewlis, who started off strong but then became incredibly comical towards the final act. Not to say that being comical is a bad idea but it didn't fit with his character and took me out of the movie.The majority of the jokes hit for me in this movie and I wouldn't say any of them felt forced or out of place. Don't complain that 'DC's Copying Marvel' because not once did I feel like this was a Marvel movie and was convinced it was DC's own thing throughout the entire run time.All in all, I definitely recommend you watch this movie. If you're reading this review while the movie is in theatre's, please watch it instead of 'Pirates 5' because this movie needs to do well and will hopefully convince Warner Bros that this is the movie is what the fans want. I very much so enjoyed this movie and will rate it 9 out of 10 Scottish Accents!","13 out of 26 found this helpful.

RATING: 3.4/5Well i have to say, Gal Gadot really owned the role of Wonder Woman. She did a great job and i think the character is totally safe in her capable hands. This movie had a really solid, arguably great, start. Finding out about the Amazons and their warrior origins, was super interesting to me. The 2nd Act, shifting over to the World War 1 stuff, was pretty good and i actually wish they did more with that, but somewhere along the way, you could just feel the suits in Hollywood get involved. The 3rd Act literally devolved into nothing but excessively bad CGI and explosions. It was kind of sad to see because the movie was on its way to being great before getting totally derailed.The quiet moments in this movie, where the characters were allowed to just breathe and be themselves, is where this movie shined IMO. Chris Pine did a solid job as Steve Trevor, definitely well cast, you could feel both characters struggle trying to work with and understand each other, coming from different worlds. The villains weren't built up very well, and that normally wouldn't be that big a deal, except the way they were used at the end, meant that they needed to be fleshed out more for it to really resonate with the audience the way it was supposed to.The movie is by no means bad, it's just painfully okay, you could even argue good and that would be totally fine, but the fact that it was headed toward being great, is what's really getting under my skin here. I feel like this movie was just outright robbed of how great it could have been, and that's a crying shame... guess i can find solace in owning the animated Wonder Woman blu ray, that one's pretty great ^_^","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

While this did dent my confidence in Wonder Woman a but I was still convinced it would be a big improvement and hopefully set this universe back on the right track and thankfully my faith was very well placed. Wonder Woman is without a doubt one of my favourite movies of this year so far and a lot of that has to do with the titular character herself. Gal Gadot is brilliant as her, she brings just the right amount of naivety yet sheer will to this character, she's brilliant in the action sequences and like Ben Affleck before her has proved plenty of her doubters wrong. All the performances in this movie we're solid Chris Pine was great, even though I was a bit disappointed that he didn't enter this universe as Green Lantern he made this character his own and really stood out. David Thewlis brought quite a lot to his character and I liked the good nature of his character. Wonder Woman had a nice heart to it which I really appreciated. The tone was just right, it was good for this film to go down a more light-hearted direction, I didn't mind the dark tones of MOS and BVS but I don't want non stop darkness, there is room for some lightheartedness that this film had just the right amount of. It did have its more serious and darker moments it felt like there was a good balance between the light and dark that Suicide Squad couldn't quite find. I've always liked that the DCEU has put there characters first, even if they don't always succeed and this film was no acceptation. Diana and her arc in this film was just right, I liked her primary mission but also a lot of the obstacles she experiences along the way that show her humanity is not a perfect as she would like it to be. I loved Chris Pine's character in this movie, not only was he really funny as well as very entertaining, he had great chemistry with Gal Gadot that made you care even more about his character even if they did take him in some predictable routes. I also really enjoyed the team of men who accompany them, they weren't in the film much but shined when they were and added some much needed levity.I loved the World War One setting of this movie, it let this movie stand on its own truly apart for the rest of the universe. They didn't really shy away from some of the horrors of this war and tied it in nicely with its main plot. It also gave director Patty Jenkins a chance to really shine, she directed this film fantastically, she took to the action sequences very well making them seem somewhat real as well as gritty. My biggest issue with this movie was it's villainous characters, I liked there designs and were good in the action set pieces but they felt quite conventional and under-utilised. Often there'd just be scenes cutting back to them talking ominously about there lack of time or there evil plans, it felt a bit jarring compared to the rest of the film and most of there plot line doesn't truly come to ahead until the final act. Wonder Woman is a step back in the right direction for the DCEU, it had terrific action sequences with solid characters played very by the actors and actresses portraying them, it had a good heart to it that benefited the lighter tone while not being without its darker moments. It did have issues with its villains but that's a small price to pay for a truly fantastic experience that feels like a good half way between the DCEU's haters and its supporters. 9.1/10-A (Phenomenal)","17 out of 36 found this helpful.

And Wonder Woman is EVERYTHING I wanted it to be. I'll readily admit I was incredibly disappointed with Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad when i saw them at the movies. But now the DCEU is finally gaining the footing it should have achieved with Dawn of Justice. And I LOVE this movie; Wonder Woman is finally in her own movie, after 76 years of comic-book history in the making! The story is self-contained feel good bliss, Gal Gadot is wonderful as Diana, and director Patty Jenkins has brought us the first GREAT female superhero movie!Wonder Woman is DC's answer to Marvel's Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor; and it makes an even better movie out of the two mixed together. I was happily surprised by how good this movie was. Truly good stuff to find here; Themyscira is FINALLY brought to us on the big screen and it's glorious, and then being taken to World War One Europe is just as fantastically realised as The First Avenger's World War Two setting. This whole film is like a standout issue of the Wonder Woman comic. The story's the perfect playground for developing comic's GREATEST superheroine! Besides some questionable CG in the third act, I don't have any particularly big gripes with the movie.Hopefully with Wonder Woman DC will give Justice League the narrative focus t deserves (fingers crossed on that though). This film is the first great instalment in the DCEU film series yet, and I'm truly hoping there are other films just as good as Wonder Woman down the line.The Lasso of Truth compels me to give the movie: 10/10.","17 out of 36 found this helpful.

Don't make your reviews so obviously fake, especially when you're posting from an account that you just opened.As for the movie - just skip it. Gal Gadot's charm in the interviews and talk shows does not translate to the big screen. Any woman with a pretty face can recite lines. Her performance was generic at best. The entire plot was shallow, paint-by-numbers, and the jokes were cringeworthy.I really wanted DCEU to succeed, to have another cinematic world in submerge in. They may make some money and have their army of loyal fans rabidly defending them, but in the end, the quality of these movies is really, really low. Even Thor 2 had a more coherent story and more entertaining dialogues.","104 out of 247 found this helpful.

Because all the recent DC Movies didn't live up to all the hype. However, once I sat down in the theatre, all comfortable with my popcorn and icee and watched the film, I can say that it is absolutely amazing! It definitely lives up to its potential. Once the movie was over, I started clapping and, after I left the theatre, I realized my hands were red because I had clapped so hard.The story of this film starts on Themyscira, an island cloaked from society and home to the Amazons. Diana, Princess of the Amazons, finds an allied spy who washed on shore named Steve Trevor. He tells her about the horrors of World War l and she decides to join him to stop The War to End All Wars.Gal Gadot plays Wonder Woman and, oh my gosh, she is awesome! She is courageous and fierce, but also intelligent and empathetic. She is the perfect role model for every little girl. She is the iconic Wonder Woman! But in all seriousness, all the actors are awesome and really likable. One particular character that didn't get enough screen time was Steve's secretary, Eta Candy, played by Lucy Davis. She is really funny and has some great one liners. She really deserved more time to shine. The special effects and fight scenes are also extraordinary. During most of the action scenes, I found myself leaning forward, wide-eyed and gripping my seat. Unlike Batman V Superman or Suicide Squad, I could actually SEE what was happening! To me, the best scene in the movie is when Diana, Steve and his crew lead an invasion of a German controlled town and liberate it. The action is so exciting and, when the Wonder Woman theme starts playing, I literally started smiling until the scene was over. Surprisingly, this film is also extremely hilarious. I was laughing for a good chunk of time. The humor mainly comes from Diana's lack of knowledge of our civilization. There's a really funny scene where Eta tries to give Diana a normal outfit and she kicks and rips the skirt. I definitely give this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18. This movie opens in theatres on June 2, 2017. I could say I recommend this movie for comic book fans, but honestly everyone should see this movie. Wonder Woman is an iconic role model and Gal Gadot definitely lives up to the part. Director Patty Jenkins lassoed this hit film and I love that a woman directed it - Girl Power! That's the truth.Reviewed by Calista B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.","15 out of 31 found this helpful.

She pulls you inside her world of 'Wonder Woman' & doesn't let you go. Donning the superwoman role for the 2nd time, starting with the forgettable Batman V. Superman, Gadot brings energy, command & a whole new level to the word Sexy! She's irresistible.Having said that, 'Wonder Woman' is never as strong as her leading-lady. While she soars, the Writing never allows the narrative to remain consistently strong. Its entertaining, but far from amazing.'Wonder Women' Synopsis: Before she was Wonder Woman she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained warrior. When a pilot crashes and tells of conflict in the outside world, she leaves home to fight a war to end all wars, discovering her full powers and true destiny.'Wonder Woman' begins grippingly & holds well until our strong leading-lady comes to London with her Leading-Man (A Likable, Earnest Chris Pine) . But, soon after, the pace drops & gets sluggish. Also, despite some excellent action set-pieces, the film never Wow's you, as the Writing gets lazy. What starts off as an engaging origin story, suddenly becomes a regular Good versus Evil Fight. The villains lack the punch, so its all about upto the wondrous superwoman to keep it going.And Gadot does it with spectacular success. I was mesmerized by Gadot's heroic turn, that is sure to send the audiences into a high. Gadot is a Star & is certainly here to stay. I can't wait to see her in the Justice League Movie, which opens later this year.Allan Heinberg's Screenplay is super initially, but settles for regular stuff in its second-hour. Patty Jenkins's Direction is well-done. Graphics, expectedly, are extraordinary. And special mentions for the nicely done Cinematography by Matthew Jensen & the wonderfully done art & costume design. The Editing needed to be crisper. On the whole, 'Wonder Woman' is a Gal Gadot show all the way. Watch it for her & you'll be rewarded!","5 out of 24 found this helpful.

I had to bring a female friend with me and I did, she enjoyed the movie so much that at times she was just dishing out laughs at times I wasn't even laughing that much. It's a truly funny movie, but when it needs to... And it is convenient. My biggest criticism of some of these super hero movies, I won't name names, is that there's a joke being thrown out every 30 seconds. Even when the stakes are really high, and the world is falling apart, jokes are being thrown everywhere. That doesn't happen in this movie, when it gets dark, it gets dark. When it touches serious subjects such as consequences of war, you kind of feel it. the chemistry between Gadot and Chris is amazing, they were really good together. This was my favorite role he has been in, sry Captain. This is the best DCEU movie so far and the best since The Dark Knight to me, easily. Whatever changes were made at Warner Bros. it worked, keep hitting that note cause I like it.Aside note: I'm sure every person who played God of War I (the game) felt nostalgic throughout this movie. I love Greek mythology, always did as a kid and before Wonder Woman, I felt like God of War was one of the few things that got it right. Well done.","22 out of 49 found this helpful.

Now don't get me wrong this was a good movie and enjoyable 3 hour session (including 30min of pre trailers). But the hype it got with 90% rotten tomatoes? 70+ on meta critic? Yeah no fake ratings.Firstly this was a major step-up from previous DC installments. This was a roller-coaster ride, lots of ups and downs and a lot of beautiful action sequences. The 2 leads Gal Gadot and Chris Pine were enjoyable to watch and the chemistry between the duo bonded well on the big screen. The comedy and romantic tension between the two was well executed and put a nice tone to the darkness of the film. Final few acts were right in the feels and almost heart stopping. Not all was well. DC has been trying to play catch up with Marvel in the cinematic universe, ultimately not executing their product effectively. DC just blasted ensemble films to the audience with out building to it. Where as Marvel has been building up a backstory of a continuous villain (hydra) while at same time making a sole story for specific films. This is what DC should have done and brought this film out first, then other solo films, create a continuous back story to keep audiences engaged. This is where Wonder Woman failed. There was no real story, it was just Wonder Woman doing her thing. It was more of a spin off to a trilogy that has ended. Pacing was off too. Action scenes, though great, but came out of nowhere and stopped out of nowhere. The villain was horrible. DC is known for iconic villains and they failed here which was disappointing. In fact I'm still wondering who the villain actually is? Acting: 7/10 (Gal Gadot suits the action actress role, plays out her stunts with finesse, the innocence of Wonder Woman was well played too. Chris Pine was funny to watch with his great comic relief and charisma, but that it was it nothing too great by anyone else).Action: 7/10 (There were some great visuals amazing sequences where you would go on YouTube and search the particular scenes but some scenes had too many, overly done slo-mo. CGI in some scenes just went from Oscar worthy to a B-Grade student film).Sound: 7/10 (Wonder Woman theme played well with the action, the explosions, bullets and whips sounded decent in the Dolby Atmos theatre). Story: 4/10 (Pacing was off, lot of up and down, fast paced to really slow and dull. I'm confused to where the DC universe wants to go? They haven't developed any solid back story that will carry on and tie in to a big finale. From a solo film perspective it was great to see how Wonder Woman became a warrior but the poor use and execution of a villain was major let down. DC is known for villains they should have not gone wrong on this department. Another let down were the side characters, no development, rushed them right into the plot).Feels: 8/10 (Excellent heart throb moments towards the final act. Really felt the emotion of how it played out. Possible onion eyes for emotional romantic losers).Final Rating: 6.6/10 (Compared to BvS: 5.5/10, SuicideSquad: 5/10)","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

As far as I'm concern the tribunal over at DC is Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman. So why did it take sooo long for this movie to finally get made when the other two have been rebooted three times over? It's the best movie in the DC Extended Universe too, but that's not saying much, cause it's really not that hard to beat Man of Steel, Batman v Superman or Suicide Squad.It reminds me so much of Captain America: The first Avenger, even though they change Princess Diana's point of origin from World War II to World War I, but same premise, The Great War forces the Amazons who have not been a part of Man's world for centuries to get evolved and that came in the form of Princess Diana.The best part of the film is the relationship between Gal Gadot and Christ Pine who plays Steve Trevor, the most important man in Wonder Woman's life since the beginning. Diana coming to Man's world with this bright eyed innocence of right and wrong, and Trevor's awkwardness of trying to explain how man's world works made for some fun scenes as well as some great drama. Done so right, it really makes up the heart of the movie.The action scenes were pretty good. Sometimes a little too much CGI when trying to visual explain what Wonder Woman's power structure is, but I really like what they were doing when she worked that magic lasso (Other than getting the truth from men). It was really cool.The villains were good. Better than a lot of villains in these comic book movies, not better than Micheal Shannon as General Zod, but I really liked Dr. Poison and what they did with Aries.I will say that there were points, like during the final battle that maybe it got too corny with the dialog about the hero's journey and the villain's evil speech.But overall Wonder Woman is showing a step in the right direction for DC's film franchise, far more true to the character out of the comic than I've seen them do in this extended universe, and Gal Gadot almost became my favorite Wonder Woman (I'm sorry you can't beat Linda Carter in those satin tights but she only wins by a hair).Check it out.http://cinemagardens.com","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

I might even say the best movie that is based on a comic book. Until now Marvel was crushing DC based movies, but Wonder Woman movie gives DC a chance to level it up. Movie has a great balance between action scenes, storytelling, humor etc. A lot of blockbusters give you more or less stuff that you see in trailers and you already know what you will get. But in this movie there was not a part that was boring, and when the movie was over there was nothing missing to show or tell. Great! I would recommend it to you even if you are not a fan of comic book based movies.

And, with a driving passion to make the world a better place. The director, a woman, portrays men in the film with extreme sensitivity and respect for true masculinity. The character played by Chris Pine is a true hero. More over, he is a gentleman in the truest sense.The look of the film is fantastic, e.g. the scene in no-man's land was a tribute to the great Stanley Kubrick (All Quiet on the Western Front). The use of color was extraordinary.

Wow, people! Wonder woman is not only an Amazon, she is a Goddess created by other gods. So, being a superhero/goddess, she has to look like a top model. Not enough muscle? The actress went to the army and has more muscle than most underweight actresses out there on the big screen. Don't like her non-American accent? She's not American. Complaining about her wearing American symbols and colour? Beyond the movie's explanation for that, it's her comic book costume since her creation. They just made it more on-screen friendly.Still complaining? Have issues with the fact that she's a woman and this movie is like every other superhero movie? Sure it is, but it's like every other GOOD superhero movie out there. Don't like superhero movies? Don't go watch this one. Now, when was the last superhero movie with a woman? You're probably thinking Cat Woman, (no one remembers Electra), whose super villain was a beauty product queen with an evil product. I mean, common? Girls can't fight blood thirsty warlords or ladies that want to conquer and dominate the world? At least Wonder Woman's nemesis is the God of War, a worthy opponent.Perfect? No movie is perfect. You can always develop more this or that, but it would make the movie longer. You can argue you should've cast this or that character differently. These are normal struggles for any production. You can't please everyone at the end of the day. And making the movie longer with cause other issues such as keeping the audience with the movie. But I can't give any less that 10 here. After Batman vs Superman's disaster, this is amazing. This has raised the bar for DC movies. Hope they can keep it up and this must be encouraged, both for quality and women leads.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

The strength of the film lies in the main characters and how their journey and story together were told, in my opinion WB/DC have failed at this with Man of Steel, Batman vs Superman and definitely Suicide Squad, but Wonder Woman is a tier or two better in presenting this to the audience.Worthy to compare to Marvel Studio's better efforts for sure.If you like superhero films... go watch it, I highly recommend it.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

I keep doing this deliberately for all Hollywood movies to save money. Wonder Woman is probably the best ever super hero movie the audience has received. Because the WW doesn't carry the usual irony, indirect references to how great or powerful the superhero is. I happened to see a new and never seen before atmosphere in this movie. The character of Chris pine was well written I have only seen him in star trek movies as I don't get to watch all the regular movies. Gal Gadot lived this character, her character WW had a unique mildness which was something new to see on the screen.Every guy walked out with a crush on her and guess what there was even a fan page in FB in which Chennai city guys claimed to sell of their everything for her, and also saw in that page that there was a massive hoarding of WW in a theater from where WW was worshiped as a goddess (This hoarding thing was first ever in the last couple of decades for any HW Actor). For me this movie had filled the void of a female super hero who the young girls and women could draw some inspiration to stand out in a world filled with biased people.Though we knew WW from the free DC comics given from Maggi Noodles during the early 2000's, the movie stood out to be Extraordinarily good or great.Few kids were also leaving with teary eyes from which I am able to be relate the impact & connect WW had already created with them. Hats off to Patty for such a wonderful movie.","10 out of 19 found this helpful.

Well, Wonder Woman proves the hype was deserved and it's by far the best DC movie since 2012's The Dark Knight Rises!Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot. Remember these names because it's due to them that we finally have a phenomenal superhero movie with a strong female lead character.¬†Gal Gadot is one of the best casting choices ever, she's one of those few people that make me feel like I can't watch any other actress portray the role of¬†Wonder Woman. She elevated the movie in a way that I never thought an actor/actress could do, so it's easy to say that she's definitely the best achievement of the film.Chris Pine also gives a great performance and the amazing chemistry between him and Gadot makes me care a lot for the characters that are extremely well-developed in an excellent slow-paced first half of the movie, which is an unusual feature having in mind previous comic-to-movie adaptations. It proved very efficient because all that time spent with the main characters, learning about them and what they believe in, it all makes me really care about them so, when the battle arrives and they're in danger, it all feels way more emotional. THIS is what DC kept failing at: giving us characters under-developed, with no motivations whatsoever, put them in the middle of a fight and expect the fans to appreciate the excessive CGI and explosions.Patty Jenkins is a great director and this movie proves it: amazing COLORFUL visuals, the stories feel heartfelt and honest, the comedy is surprisingly great and the dialogue scenes, especially between¬†Diana and¬†Steve, are compelling and super captivating. The soundtrack is epic during the action scenes which are itself the definition of epicness. The first time that Wonder Woman goes into the battlefield (the one shown on the trailer) gave me chills all over my body, it's just E-P-I-C! Even if CGI is present in almost every single one of the action sequences, it's mostly well-used and it reached the awesomeness levels that I expected.The plot is simple, but efficient (even if implausible) and it still has a small not-that-obvious twist in the third act that's actually kind of cool.As for flaws, there's one that is common to every single comic-book movie ever: the villain. Once again, this character is weak (it's actually more than just one character), with no motivations besides ""destruction, yeah, war, yeah, let's kill everyone, yeah"" and all of the clich√©s are put together into one big disappointment.The final battle is CGI-heavy and there were some brief moments where it almost looked like a video game, but due to the fact that I cared so much about the characters, this becomes just a minor issue that I didn't even get bothered with during the action. The slow- motion looked cool, but it got overused by the end of the movie. Finally, I think that the movie is a tiny bit too long, but I guess every superhero movie nowadays needs to have at least a 2-hour runtime or it's not worth it for the studios, apparently.So, Wonder Woman is, in fact, the savior that the DCEU needed and it not only proved the hype and huge anticipation something worth going through this last few months, but it surpassed everything I expected this movie to be. Thank you Patty Jenkins for the brilliant direction (visuals, character-development, action scenes, soundtrack, just everything), thank you Gal Gadot for your incredibly honest performance and thank you Chris Pine for being a perfect companion for the emotional journey you all took me through, even if with some flaws here and there (please, improve your villains DC and Marvel).","16 out of 34 found this helpful.

Wonder Woman, although not perfect, edges the DCEU closer to its goal, thanks to a refreshingly optimistic hero and a plot that is neither convoluted nor cut to pieces in the editing room. Told via a flashback framing device, this WWI-set blockbuster follows the eponymous Amazonian princess Diana as she discovers mankind during one of its ugliest eras, yet continues fighting in an attempt to bring peace and harmony. It's a simple tale, but one director Patty Jenkins manages to keep on the right side of earnest with a steady flow of action and fish-out-of-water comedy. Very much shot in the style of Zack Snyder‚Äîchockfull of speed ramping and flying sparks‚Äîthe action sequences are wonderfully choreographed, but the CGI lacks photorealism at times, particularly during the opening act staged on Diana's idyllic home island. An extended set piece in which our titular goddess emerges from the trenches on the Western Front to overrun the Nazis is captivating; the dazzling cinematography and rousing score fusing together to create one the DCEU's finest moments. It helps that Jenkins has the likes of Gal Gadot in front of the camera portraying the peace-seeking warrior. Gadot is a terrific blend of strength, passion and beauty, imbuing Diana with an unstoppable righteousness that in lesser hands could have been preachy and pretentious. Relatively free from the confines of the DCEU's overlapping storytelling, Wonder Woman is an exciting superhero adventure anchored by a magnificent central performance.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

All main character have a good solid story arc of their own which is satisfying and helps tie this up in a single film. It hits a different pace to anything in the superhero market at the moment, I can see some people having an issue with that - but it works. Sound is good (if not a little standard) graphics are good with only minor rag doll issues. Some cheesy lines but it's a superhero movie and that's OK! Gal Gadot is a good Wonder Woman, she isn't the all American hero people are expecting, she is the fierce female Amazon that you love from the comics. You can feel Zach Snyders influence in the choreography and fighting style, there are some strong sucker punch vibes flowing though it. There are going to be a lot of confused male viewers that don't 'get it' as seen on the reviews already. But don't be put off this is not another Catwoman.

Although the film uses tropes and conventions that come with the territory of superhero films, it still manages to make them feel fresh, funny and enjoyable especially because much of the film involves Diana becoming accustomed and familiar with the world of human beings which is highly different to her world which belongs to Amazonian Gods. The fish out of water element of the narrative helps in downplaying the standards tropes and freshening them up.2. The film has a very refreshing humanistic soul. Just like the protagonist, the film exudes an innocent sense of optimism and belief that is genuinely moving.3. One has to admire what it stands for and what it will do in terms of inspiring countless young girls(and boys) and stand as an example to show that a female led big budget superhero film won't always be an 'Elektra' or a 'Catwoman'.4. The DC cinematic universe, as is clear by now, will continue to deal with stuff like gods, myths, legends, etc. But thankfully unlike 'Batman v Superman' where there was a constant attempt to make a silly, convoluted fight between two gorillas wearing circus costumes seem Biblical, profound and 'important' with Lex Luthor constantly spouting pretentious, pseudo-intellectual gibberish revolving around theology, 'Wonder Woman' at least decides to have fun with this stuff by subverting these elements for the most part.5. Director Patty Jenkins clearly has an eye for visuals that have a flair to them. There are so many shots and sequences in the film that are rich with energy and personality. She makes use of Gal Gadot's physicality to give us a superhero who genuinely looks distinctive and enigmatic. The No Man's Land sequence is a great example of bravura filmmaking.6. Gal Gadot isn't giving the deepest, most complicated performance ever, but Jenkins plays to Gadot's strengths and managed to make her look as good as possible and the very aspect of the Amazonians being somewhat literal organisms ends up making Gal Gadot's stiffness in many scenes along with her somewhat one dimensional line delivery seem understandable and maybe even warranted. Chris Pine is really good and his chemistry with Gal Gadot is one of the strongest things in the film.Now let's talk about the things that I didn't like: 1. The CGI isn't very good or convincing in many scenes. There are extended sequences where the green screens become easily discernible from a visual standpoint.2. Patty Jenkins unfortunately resorts to the Zack Snyder school of slow motion abuse constantly during the action scenes. I have always felt that overusing slow motion during combat sequences only lessens the impact and appeal of these scenes.3. The reveal when it comes to the real villain can be seen coming from a distance. It just lacks the impact and surprise that it aspires to achieve.4. The majority of the final act disappointingly reverts back to a live-action video game spectacle just like 'Man of Steel' did in its final act. This prolonged badly choreographed CGI fest which the film ends with somewhat betrays all the good work that preceded it.'Wonder Woman' is flawed, but it's still a good, inspirational and enjoyable film with a good heart. I like the fact that it did unexpectedly well at the box-office because of everything that it stands for. It's not the greatest film you'll ever see, but compared to the previous outings in the DCEU like the disappointing 'Man of Steel', the pretentious and bloated 'Batman v Superman' and the laughable mess 'Suicide Squad', 'Wonder Woman' feels like a much needed breath of fresh air.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The movie is considered an empowerment for women and equality. Having finally seen the movie, my feelings towards it are unfortunately mixed.There are many aspects I really liked about the movie. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are perfectly cast in their roles. Diana Prince is a naive but fierce heroine and very likable. She definitely is the best part of the movie for me. Her character is well fleshed out and she has great chemistry with Chris Pine's character. Furthermore there are some spectacular action sequences in the movie. The stunt work is just stunning and the often present slow motion additionally helps to appreciate the action scenes. Despite the brilliant action throughout the movie, the film really thrives on its quite moments that focus on the character development, which is very present in this superhero flick. Sadly there are a few aspects about the movie that I did not like. The humor was not funny at all in my opinion and the movie could have easily gone without it. Further there were a few scenes that appeared forced to me like the conversation at the gala between Wonder Woman and General Ludendorff. These minor points of criticism did not ruin the movie for me though. However, the third part of the movie did. I do not want to go into spoilers here but one character was in my opinion extremely miscast and appeared quite hilarious to me. Additionally, the last part of the movie is quite CGI heavy which also added to taking away the tension, since the CGI was not exceptionally well done and could have been handled better. Also the big reveal at the end was kind of disappointing and felt forced in my opinion, since there has not been a single hint towards it and I had the impression that it was included simply because they felt that they could not go for a straight forward plot. For all the reasons, I was not able to enjoy the last part of the movie and unfortunately it took away a lot from the experience.To sum up, Wonder Woman is definitely the best DC Extended Universe movie that has been released yet but I simply cannot relate to the excellent reviews it receives. Most part of the movie I really enjoyed but the third part just ruined so much for me that it makes it impossible for me to say I am a fan of the film. Nonetheless, I think DC is on the right path with investing more into character driven movies instead of cramping every possible into a single film.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

It only took 40 years of waiting for me but I'm glad the day is here finally. I loved every minute of it, I get sick of origin stories when we've seen them over and over but since this was the first Wonder Woman to hit the big screen it was perfect. I don't know why some people say it was too long and boring, it was a perfect telling of the story and had the right amount of action in it. If I had any complaint it would only be that Chris Pine's acting in this was just like how he is as Captain Kirk. So basically some of the scenes I could only see him as Kirk the way he was delivering his lines but that's a small worry.I will definitely be watching this one over and over once I get it on DVD. I'm really loving the DC universe, it's like the complete opposite of Marvel which I think is good they're not carbon copies of each other. Really looking forward to Justice League.

Still...This movie suffers from the same reason as the other two movies, which is action and villains...It's too much CGI and a lot of times it is too obvious, it just ruins many of the action sequences. This goes for the final battle as well. It's just worse, the main villain does not represent a danger in any way. It just floats in the air and that's all...wtf... It really is too bad because this could have been a very good movie...Instead it's a movie with great characters, fun,a great soundtrack, but broken by the action sequences and villains which are just so bad...It's really a shame","49 out of 109 found this helpful.

These blockbusters were designed to get people into the theaters and to appeal to 15-year-old boys in Taiwan - normally not my thing, but they definitely have their place.Here Diana is Gal Gadot who has it all and boy does she kick some you-know-what. The actress apparently did her own stunts, including while she was five months pregnant. So she's a superwoman in real life and in reel life, also having served with the Israeli Army.The cast includes Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, and Danny Huston. How fabulous to see the ""House of Cards"" leading lady, Wright, as an Amazon warrior.In this version, Diana fights in World War I, not II, which director Patty Jenkins found more interesting.Filmed partially in Italy, the settings are glorious. Superheroes, all-powerful men and women who fight evil in the world, started to become popular during World War II, I wonder why, feeding into the fantasy of someone swooping down and solving our problems. If only! But there's nothing wrong with being entertained, looking at a couple of beautiful people in Pine and Gadot, and hearing that only love can save the world. It's a good reminder and bears repeating.","17 out of 37 found this helpful.

Apart from that the story isn't that great, i mean nothing special will surprise you really in the movie and a lot of parts reminded me of the Captain America first movie with all the fighting the German stuff and the hero having a diverse(nationality wise) special hit squad. Lastly, i would say that if you just want to watch a superhero action movie to pass the time, this will due.

Give DC a break here, this is Wonder Woman for crying out loud who is technically a God created to destroy Ares, let's give some allowances for the writing, in a world saturated with superhero movies.......!!!","9 out of 17 found this helpful.

An easy to follow plot but not too simple, well stuck touches of humor and a ""recyclable"" villain, as well as the impressive special effects make for the viewer this movie all along enjoyable.Under the great direction of Patty Jenkins and, despite many wouldn't like to hear this, Zach Snyder does a wonderful job as a scriptwriter, DC brings a story centered in a flashback, where we can see the princess Diana and her development process to become Wonder Woman. The interesting thing about this story, despite focusing on the First World War and showing without hesitation the human evil, is that the values that they want to convey with this character are that there are still things to fight for. The same idea that was present in Henry Cavill Superman but with a much better result.In terms of performance, no one can deny that Gal Gadot is the perfect Wonder Woman, a flawless performance, where she shows throughout the film how her character is gradually maturing. The touches of humor fit her perfectly and makes her character trustworthy, a woman without fear that fights against any opposition and with very clear values, perfection.The soundtrack of the character that we were already introduced in Batman v Superman makes you sense very powerful action scenes and you feel every movement. In terms of special effects, CGI is much better introduced here than in Batman v Superman, but they overuse slow motion again, although, the close-ups are perfectly involved.In conclusion, it is possibly the best film of this DC new universe, but I do not think that they should be limited to this. It is a very good movie of origins but I hope that they continue working and that we see movies with a bigger plot in the future. For the time being, the to-do of the DCEU are the villains, better call Nolan for that.","15 out of 32 found this helpful.

"","","Nice superhero-movie but overly American and Hollywoodified and not much of a feminist icon","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3765837/?ref_=tt_urv","mgk98","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur73501031/?ref_=tt_urv","28 July 2017","I must admit that I'm very disappointed. The movie had been praised for being such a strong movie regarding feminism and finally giving us a non-sexualized, strong, bad ass female lead. This is not entirely the case in my opinion.Wonder Woman is strong and bad ass, that is true. I also love how all the Amazons are strong as hell and incredible good at fighting! But Wonder Woman is still sexualized to the skies! If you look at her outfit: HEELED shoes (they can't be very practical) and a tiny skirt (they could easily have made it just a few inches longer without it having any effect on her freedom of movement). I know that they were probably trying to be true to the comics, but I think they could have pulled that outfit together in other ways and still achieve that. And why would the Amazons, who have been isolated from the rest of the world for thousands of years, shave? How did they even come up with that idea? It serves no real purpose. (Just to be clear - I shave and like being shaved, but I'm 100% sure that's because I've been socialized to like it, and I think it's unrealistic that the Amazons would shave).Another thing I dislike about the movie is the whole WW1-plot. It's one of the most American movies I have ever seen (not meant in a good way), depicting the Germans as literal monsters and insane people, whereas the Brits and Americans are all heroes (very one-dimensional). It's an old, tired, American plot seen way too many times before. Very Hollywood. Besides all that it has a looot of loopholes. If you put all these things aside, then it's a nice superhero-movie - it's funny, filled with action and Chris Pine is exceptional. If the movie hadn't been so hyped and praised I'm sure I wouldn't have been as disappointed. So, if you like (very American and Hollywoodified) superhero-movies give it a try. Just don't expect too much.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

After each one came out, fans were hoping the next one would be the movie that would be embraced by all movie going fans alike. Now, that next one is Wonder Woman. Is Wonder Woman going to be the first DCEU film to be overwhelmingly praised? Yeah, I think it will!Wonder Woman stars Fast and the Furious actress Gal Gadot as Diana, the princess of Themiscara, which is a mysterious island of amazons hidden from the outside world. The action starts when Chris Pine's Steve Trevor meets Diana when he crashes his plane near Themiscara and recruits her to help him with the escalating World War.I went into this movie with a lot of reluctance because I love these DC characters and Batman v Superman, Suicide Squad and even in some ways Man of Steel disappointed in different ways. I wanted this movie to be the first great DCEU movie and I'm really happy to say that it is!Patty Jenkins directs with grace and wonder. You can tell how much she loves the character of Wonder Woman. Patty Jenkins had said that one of her favorite films growing up was Superman: the Movie from 1978 and you can really tell because there are a few homages to that movie. Wonder Woman is a strong character and this film makes movies like Catwoman and Elektra look like a complete joke. If you mix together the fish-out-of-water element of Thor and place it into the World War setting of Captain America: The First Avenger, then you get a good idea of what this movie is.Much like Chris Hemsworth in the first Thor and Dave Bautista in Guardians of the Galaxy, Gal Gadot is limited in the amount of dramatic acting she has to do and is instead given the chance to show her surprisingly decent comedic chops to hide her unseasoned acting ability. The beauty comes from when Gadot really needs to get serious in some key scenes, she brings it and she's pretty commendable. Add on her great physicality and look and Gadot is actually pretty damn good in the role!Her Chemistry with Chris Pine is one of the highlights of the movie and may be one of the reasons Gadot is as good as she is. There are several scenes where his performance is just laugh out loud funny. In particular, a scene with both Pine and Gadot on a boat had me howling for more.At the end of the day, while I wouldn't say that Wonder Woman is one of the best comic book movies ever made by any stretch of the imagination. I would, however, say that it is a very good installment and that it is the best DC movie since 2008's The Dark Knight!4/5","15 out of 32 found this helpful.

Movie started so well i almost forgot i had to pee. After 40 minutes, addition of a world war stupidity to it was pathetic. CGI effects were like that of a child. An intern of graphic designing could have done a better job in these effect. The god of war, he was a useless character, of all the world with so many available options for this villain, they chose a cripple with useless end. I was so disappointed. Fat secretary, childish acting, crippled plot line, killed the movie since 40th minute and then it kept sucking, only thing had me wait for the god of war and then that happened, i finally realized, DC comics need an upgrade. They have been persistently disappointing in last two years. First that stupid suicide squad and now this mindless freak show, they really need to learn from Stan lee. I am disappointed.

"8","/10","An undeniably great DCEU movie","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3785304/?ref_=tt_urv","breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur29565770/?ref_=tt_urv","20 August 2017","Comic book movies have long been underway for a few decades now. It was only until the 1990s were more properties beginning to show up. This was the trial stage for characters that were very much obscure to most. Then during the early 2000s, more properties were getting adaptations and with greater receptions. Though there were still flubs along the way, the code was for the most part cracked on making successful superhero films. After the 2010s, Marvel Studios had found a method of perfecting their films that many would envy for today. Of those Warner Brothers was struggling for a while to get their famous heroes going. Superman Returns (2006), Jonah Hex (2010) and Green Lantern (2011) all pretty much fell flat in getting an expanded universe going. It was only Christopher Nolan's Batman series that really got any attention. At last Warner Bros. made Man of Steel (2013), Suicide Squad (2016) and Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016), but all were mixed. Here though we have something much better.As popular as Wonder Woman is, the character had not had a live action venture into cinemas once. Before this she had only been portrayed in fan-made shorts, animated home video films and her own TV show in 1975. That's it though. Plus seeing how things turned out with Warner Brothers few entries in their shared universe, it was a bit worrisome thinking how this might turn out. The good news is, this feature is much better than anything so far. Written mainly by Allan Heinberg, the screenplay was well crafted for this adaptation. Surprisingly Heinberg had only worked on TV productions before this. Gal Gadot plays Diana, an Amazonian who is protected by her fellow sisters and mother from Ares, the god war. The thing is Diana does not know how powerful she truly is. When a pilot by the name of Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes nearby, Diana learns of World War I that's going on around her. Believing she can make a difference and that Ares is the cause of the problem, she goes where no man would ever want to.Directed by Patty Jenkins, the director of Monster (2003), the vision she had for the film is competently fulfilled. The top actors all do a great job under her wing. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman gives a charming performance, with strength and tenderness all in one. Not only can she play a likable heroine but also can really pull off some tough sequences. Her development is also handled very well. There are so many points in which she learns about mankind. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor plays an admirable soldier. He too learns off of Diana for her lack of understanding. The rest of the supporting cast act enthusiastically too. Connie Nielsen as Diana's mother can stand her ground quite well. Danny Huston as Ludendorff, the main backer behind the Great War is intimidating in his portrayal along with his mad scientist Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya). There's also appearances from Robin Wright, David Thewlis, Sa√Ød Taghmaoui, and Ewen Bremner. All of which follow Diana in her journey to stop Ares.The only thing that might pose a problem to viewers may the portrayal of some characters. One character in particular is played by someone who doesn't exactly fit the role. Although in the end, they are not seen that much, it still may be a bit off putting. The action scenes shot in this film are well staged too. Unlike the past DCEU films, this one uses a mixture of CGI and what feels like practical effects. As the film reaches its third act, it is already assumed CGI would be the biggest driver in visuals, but at least here it doesn't look like video game cut scenes. That was all too abundant in movies like Batman Vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016). Plus the progression of the action scenes change over time too. This gives the viewers a nice dose of all kinds of firepower. Whether that be sword fights, superhero powers or trench warfare, it keeps the experience new and interesting. The best scene was probably in ""No Man's Land"", where Diana takes over the battleground. Can't do that in Call of Duty.The camera-work was another pleasing element. Managed by Matthew Jensen, the cinematography was put together very professionally. No shaky cameras were used in the making of this production and the lens is as wide as it gets for the ultimate landscape view. The color pallet is also a great addition to the settings. Where Diana grew up as compared to the land where the war was being fought had drastic differences. This was used to emphasize the contrasts in man's corruption. Jensen had also done work for movies like Chronicle (2012) and Fantastic Four (2015). For music, the film score was composed by Rupert Gregson-Williams, the brother Harry Gregson-Williams, another composer. For his work, Rupert did an adequate job. Unfortunately as important as reviving an original theme is, Rupert brings back Hans Zimmer ugly electric cello theme for Diana. It just doesn't fit. Nevertheless the music (including that theme) work in making a unique sound for Wonder Woman. It's an effective score with a number of good moments.Finally, the DCEU has a film that can be called a great movie. The best part is, is that it's of a character who hasn't gotten their own movie yet. Aside from the portrayal of a couple characters, the rest of the film in its entirety works great. The music, camera-work, action, actors and writing are all top notch.","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

Hmmm, not bad! I check out other websites like this one, and they gave it mostly a high % with positive reviews. They don't mention this one by the way...and now I'm figuring out why. I see the audience 'exit poll' results and the movie got mostly A and A+s from people leaving the theatre. Hmmm... Then I look at the awards and find it got the best Action Movie awards from the People's Choice Awards and Gal Gadot got best female lead award from the Actors Guild awards, among others. 
So l come over to this website and start with the reviews, and all I see is bunch of whining about how folks can't believe this movie was rated so high on here and why they think this website is rigged, etc. etc. etc. 
Then I figured it out; This website either exists in an alternate reality, or it has a bunch of angry, bitter, depressed people reviewing on it that can't stand the idea that people actually ENJOY sitting down with a bag of chips and dip with your family after a hard week at work, kicking your shoes off, building a fire in the fireplace, and watching a great action movie to enjoy themselves. Because...uh, that's what NORMAL people do! It's a pretty simple word we're working with here, it's called entertainment! I don't sit down with a pen and paper and start crucifying a movie because it's not Lord of the Rings or Citizen Kane. 
Is this the BEST movie I've ever seen?...no
Do you have to suspend belief?...uh, don't you have to do that with every stinkin movie of this genre?..yes
It's a great action movie with great Special Effects and there is absolutely NOTHING wrong with the acting! Chris Pine and Gal Gadot do just fine. The story is just fine. Everything about this movie is just fine.
I keep thinking that I'm done coming to this website, but I felt I had to stand up for this movie against some of the garbage I've read folks spew about it. I'm beginning to think that this website exists in an alternate reality or something, or maybe it's just got a core of reviewers that review movies that are...well, different or something. I don't know...
But do yourself a favor and ignore the negative reviews on here and enjoy this movie that the rest of the normal world thought was pretty good...including me.","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

The screenplay of the DC Comics perennial favorite comic book heroine was written sensitively by Allan Heinberg based on the story by Zach Snyder, Allen Heinberg and Jason Fuchs who remodeled Dr. William Moulton Marston's original creation from 1941! One of the reasons this version works so well is sharing the origins of Wonder Woman so well: her beginnings as a child ('sculpted from clay by Zeus) being raised by Hippolyta (Connie Nielsen) and Antiope (Robin Wright), and finally flying off to defeat the god of war Ares (whatever happened to Mars?). Gorgeous scenery and terrific special effects offer a springboard to the story that follows.When a pilot crashes and tells of conflict in the outside world, Diana (Gal Gadot), an Amazonian warrior in training, leaves home to fight a war, discovering her full powers and true destiny. Before she was Wonder Woman, she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained to be an unconquerable warrior. Raised on a sheltered island paradise, when an American pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes on their shores and tells of a massive conflict raging in the outside world, Diana leaves her home, convinced she can stop the threat. Fighting alongside man in a war to end all wars, Diana will discover her full powers¬Öand her true destiny. In the setting of WW I in Germany the bad guys are Ludendorff (Danny Huston), Sir Patrick (David Thewlis), and Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya), and Diana's allies are Steve (Chris Pine), Sameer (Said Taghmaoui), Charlie (Ewen Bremner). The supporting cast is excellent also.For once the CGI effects enhance rather than distract (until the final confrontation between Diana and Ares), the musical score (Rupert Greson-Williams) fits the film, and the photography (Michael Jensen) is rather splendid. There is enough pungent anti-war philosophy to make the film sail. This is bound to be followed by a series of more adventures: the public loves DC Comics ‚Äì and in this case the praise is worthy.","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

Danny Huston and Elena Anaya were terrific bad guys and David Thewlis is always great. And a special shout out to Lucy Davis who is marvelous providing some comic relief. But of course this is ultimately Gal Gadot's film and she was an impressive Wonder Woman. She's very tall and gorgeous of course so you knew that physically she would fit the bill well, but she really delivered in all of the scenes including the lighter moments. There is a lot of action including some really good scenes with the Amazons in the beginning of the film. The special effects were good, but not great (I did see the 3D version). I really loved the island of the Amazons set and would love to find a place like that to retire to. Even the vintage clothing in the film looked good. The movie moved quickly (especially the first hour and a half). All in all a very enjoyable time at the movies.","11 out of 22 found this helpful.

All characterisation seemed to be either absent or based on singular traits, therefore arousing no emotions or empathy. The romance seemed forced. The ending was similar to Batman v/s Superman. There was too much CGI in the latter half of the movie, and it was pretty obvious.

I've never read the Wonder Woman comics though I did read of her adventures in the All-Star Squadron comics during the '80s which depicted her Earth-2 (original Golden Age version) counterpart during WWII. All that I just mentioned were pretty enjoyable. As for this version, Gal Gadot certainly has both the beauty and body strength for the character. Chris Pine was also fine as her heroic partner-both in battle and love-Steve Trevor. Setting it during World War I was a nice change. The action was awesome and the occasional humor was also welcome.

Felt more like a 'coming of age' teenage melodrama, with a DC Superhero tag draped over for decoration. Plenty of adolescent characters exist for that purpose in the DC Universe. But this is Wonder Woman we are talking about! The quintessential feminist icon from the comic realm. Feminine charm & grace going hand-in-hand with super strength and badassery.But apparently, DC has resigned itself to the fate that it is secondary to Marvel when it comes to the Cinematic Universe. Film after film dropping far below expectations, completely falsifying anticipations that have built up for decades. Continuously handing over the directorial job to people not fit for that purpose.This sheer non-seriousness on the part of the DC administration almost feels like villainous in intent; as if DC itself is the greatest villain of its universe, destroying superhero after superhero with half-baked ideas, unnecessarily long scripts, and predictable story lines.Hats off to Chris Pine, outshining everything else in the movie and for appearing more radiant than even Wonder Woman in certain scenes.Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman fits the look and personality, but with limited acting range (one could count the number of her facial expressions on fingertips!) and an unfit screenplay, she comes off as only a shadow of the 'Amazonian demigoddess'.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

As a superhero's origin story, inherently the film has no alternative to spare audience the mandatory ex-positional narrative arc of Diana's backstory, she is a deicidal creation conceived by Zeus and Hippolyta (Nielsen), the Queen of the Amazons, to stop Ares, the God of War, from wrecking havoc in planet earth. The advent of a WWI Allied spy Steve Trevor (Pine) disrupts the tranquility of Themyscira, a hidden and empyrean island where resides the kingdom of these all- female Amazonians. After having the first contact with advanced mass-killing weaponry, pitched battlefield and sacrifice, against the will of her mother, Diana resolves to plunge herself into the WWI front, and firmly believes that if she can assassinate the evil German General Erich Ludendorff (Huston), whom she redeems as the reincarnation of Ares, the war will end. Aided by Steve and his allies, Diana gallantly enters into the mankind turmoil, and her faith will be put into test when things fail to turn out as she expected, does mankind really deserve her? An honest-to- goodness script shoots blunt barbs towards our patriarchal society and innate frailties, which emphatically differentiates the film from most its peers with its sobriety of what causes all the mayhem. The turning point also hits the mark when a heroic act viscerally teaches her what love means and why us, the lesser mortals still deserve her protection. What makes the movie click with mass audience is the humble and self-deprecating attitude in its backbone.On the other side of the coin, WONDER WOMAN is nevertheless, hampered by its comic strip puerility, from a black-or-white characterization to slipshod plot designation, villains are ill-fatedly sidelined to leave more room for catalyzing the improbable cross-species romance, and its comic relief is essentially PG-13 and in shortfall before everything will be duly embroiled with gravitas, pathos and moral conundrum. Be that as it may, Gal Gadot is indisputably an entrancing Wonder Woman, particularly in the action scenes, where she jumps, dashes, whomps, high-kicks like a genuine warrior choreographed with female-empowering confidence, wet behind her ears sometimes, but ultimately virtuous, courageous, lethal and unyielding. Accordingly, Chris Pine, although pigeonholed in a lesser salient role, breathes an air of endearment into the scene, Pine's personal charisma is a force to be reckoned with in spite of the limit of his potency, which is essential to precipitate the game- changing shift during the crescendo. From a strategic point, the movie's success bracingly reassures the stuffy studio bosses that audience is heartily welcoming female talents both before and behind the camera, and also substantiates that DC Comics can finally take up the gauntlet from Marvel Universe after many an underperformed juggernaut and at the very least it sparks a possibility that it may interrupt the latter's hyper-prolific monopoly in the market, which is always a good thing for audience looking for diversity and pluralism.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

The plot holes were massive and the progress was way to slow. The directing was okay and the production was high budget quality (maybe a bit higher than what you would expect from the budget they had). The CGI was brilliant and the acting was spot on... So why would I only give it a 7 then?Well to put it in the words of Louie CK ""There is no such thing as an accent, it's just a whole country of people saying words wrong"". The movie starts off with some of the strangest takes on the English accent that you have ever heard, all because Gal Gadot cannot speak English with an American accent, so for that reason everyone needs to talk weird. Then there is the fact that day and night differs in areas one moment and the next they are perfectly aligned. The battles were against horrible fighters and it almost made iron man 3's battle against the falling rocks look more credible. Diana had no knowledge of who she is yet she possessed perfect knowledge of her abilities within seconds. All of this was not thought through well enough, but then you realize that this is not about a good story. It's about a beautiful woman who can also fight, and that is CLEARLY stated in the film. I think that the biggest challenge in the film was to get Gal Gadot and Chris Pine's hottest angles right every time. If you see the film you'll know what I mean. It all revolves around their beauty and granted it worked. Every guy walking out of the cinema now has a new Hollywood crush and every girl revived their Hollywood crush on Chris Pine. BUT I don't think that is what stories are about. Any two other actors that were a bit less ""hot"" would've seriously tanked this film. Good effort for a film and luckily not another attempt at making comedy superhero movies.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

And foxhole sequence was the most authentic in the movie and one that should have been the pattern for the entire film. The costumes are excellent as well.But the movie lacks a grittiness and realism that makes other origin movies so enjoyable. Where it attempts to be gritty, it feels contrived. The world of the early 1900s created in the film feels computer generated and that made it difficult to lose yourself in the narrative (I found myself looking at the clock continually). I never got into ""flow"" with this film.Finally, the story is too grandiose. The story should have been about Diana and the complex development of her as a hero. Instead the writers bit off far too much and attempt narratives on six other principle characters, a world war, the Greek pantheon, and an Amazonian society. They end up doing justice to none of them and end up less with a character study as they do a disjointed and shallow video game like experience.While the movie is fine entertainment for family film night, unfortunately it doesn't have a place in the pantheon of the excellent origin films of recent years. Too bad.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

The part which they could have done a bit better would be the casting. I really can't see Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. She was perfect in Fast and Furious, but here she looked a bit stiff and it looked like she struggled with the dialogues. Also the fighting parts and the whole lets say adventure seemed not to have any influence on her, like she can't get dirty or bruised while everybody else looked like they haven't showered for days which would actually be more accurate :) I liked the Amazons more than I like Wonder Woman :)","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I am directly becoming a fan, because before watching it, I never have an idea about who is Wonder Woman. Furthermore, in Wonder Woman movie, my eyes can not go to admire the figure of Wonder Woman itself, that had been perfectly played by Gal Gadot. I know Gal Gadot from Fast&Furious, but in Wonder Woman movie, she is the essence, the soul, and the beauty of the movie. Gal Gadot opens the timing for woman again becoming the core of superhero movie! Here I do not want to discuss about the Plot, because the plot is ordinary, just like other superhero movie, but I want to discuss about the characters inside the plot. First is the Wonder Woman. Oh my God, she is powerful, gorgeous, beautiful, charismatic, she is the future dream of every woman of this real life. Besides her destiny to become hero, Wonder Woman is learning about human life, especially Love and Dignity. Many times in the scenes, you can see how Wonder Woman react about Humanity, War, Peace, and Politic of human being in the most dangerous history: World War II. Yet, the epic conspiracy to make Peace coming more longer than before. Wonder Woman can prove herself to be independent and to follow the light inside herself, without intervened by surroundings and can clearly see who is the real enemy and the real hero. In this movie, you can also see other characters around Wonder Woman, but it is herself that lead the role and make different of each scene. I love Gal Gadot before, and this Wonder Woman movie makes no other female actress could combine to her unique figure. Congratulation to the Director and all crews that can maintain the meaning of superhero movies and also the effects that are really captured in each battle. LOVE THIS MOVIE!","19 out of 43 found this helpful.

Probably it helps that astonishing Gal Gadot is that super heroine. I was very pleasantly surprised about easy start and fairy tail like beginning. The whole movie has this nice pace. Like Logan it has very nice playing time, more than 2h 10m which is enough to tell a story and present characters. The movie it self, the story frame and the whole story flow reminded me of a Captain America: First avenger (which I also like). I actually like the story and the story frame. There are some moments where main character could have looked stupid but it is nicely played. Again the movie leaves you with a feeling that there is a lots of things going on. When you look back there really are some things that are going on in the movie. What I especially like with this movie is a super villain. He was not a typical one and was far better thought. Actually he was much deeper in a way that other super villains and it made some sense. The problem with superhero movies as I see it is when the story is bigger than the universe and when main villain is bigger than time presented in the story. This was not at all the case in this movie. That's why Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 totally sucks and Wonder Woman surprisingly doesn't.","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

It has a soul of its own and a very good story to tell. It catches your attention from the first scene and keeps you glued to your seat (almost), till the end. Diana's origin story, self realization and her inner conflicts are very well depicted. Almost all the central characters are etched out very well & as an audience you would definitely connect with them, emotionally too. The screenplay is well structured. Action scenes are good and CGI is apt.Performance wise Gal Gadot and Chris Pine do an amazing job. Gal Gadot brings life to the character. She makes Wonder Woman's naiveness, innocence, strength and emotions very real. Chris Pine is perfectly cast as Steve. He gets ample one liners and delivers them with panache. Like Gal, Chris too really makes the character very believable. Great work!Negatives? Yeah a few - DC still leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to choreographing action sequences. The moment action sequences begin, CGI takes over. And there are instances you almost lose your connect to the on goings on screen. Because the scenes are too CGI heavy. At couple instances you could easily make out that the action figures are completely CGI. This makes the action sequences lack the soul and indulgence, that Marvel movies do so amazingly well. The movie starts out very well and maintains a good pace until the last 20 - 30 mins. There are clich√©s and some forced twist elements, that genuinely don't work. The bad guy does not have the desired impact, as his character is not developed as good as it should be. This is the best movie in the DC universe but if WB wants to give Marvel a run for their money, there's still some work to be done. Overall, it is still a great movie. Go for it!!","8 out of 15 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Strong performances not quite enough to rescue muddled themes","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3735357/?ref_=tt_urv","steerpike_2002","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur5025708/?ref_=tt_urv","21 June 2017","There is a lot of expectation going into this movie which I think has probably helped it critically. On the one hand, it is the latest instalment in the DCEU franchise, which I think even critics want to eventually give a good score to, if only to provide some balance against the all-conquering critical success of the Marvel universe movies. Then there's the fact that this is the big female-lead movie of the year and critics will go in wanting to like it for this fact alone. With these factors combined, an average movie will probably pass, in the short term at least, for a great one.And I think that this is what has happened in this case. ""Wonder Woman"" is far from being a bad movie. A lot of reviewers have focused on the fun feel to the movie as a positive. It's certainly the most cartoon-y superhero movie to come out of the DCEU so far which seems to be a response from Warner Brothers to criticism of the drained palette and humourlessness of ""Batman vs. Superman"". While it is fun, there are definitely negatives to this style, with considerably less grit in the overly bouncy action scenes. These cannot escape from Zack Snyder's creative influence and suffer as a result. The core strengths of the movie are the central characters, Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). The characters are written well, with Wonder Woman's do-gooder resolve offset by her naivety. Gal Gadot gives a great physical and emotional performance, her movements, postures and facial expressions capturing her strength and, well, goodness perfectly. Comparisons to Christopher Reeve as Superman are fitting, and she is every bit as dashing as Reeve was. Pine almost steals the show as the love interest. He has tremendous chemistry with Gadot and his character has enough depth to be interesting in his own right.I did find the setting of the story in WWI a big distraction and a flawed choice thematically. The character Wonder Woman was created in the 1940s and her origins placed in WWII, where she battles the evil Nazis alongside Allied forces. The writers' choice here to shift this back to WWI could have been justified. For such a staunchly anti-war character, in some ways WWI is a better fit. It serves as a symbol of a mechanised embodiment of war which simply consumed men and resources rather than serving any cause. Had the creators of the movie emphasised the meaninglessness of the conflict, with no clear distinction between good sides and bad sides, it would have been a great setting to test Wonder Woman's moral strength. It also fits with Wonder Woman's key motive during the film - she must destroy Ares, as it is his external agency that she believes has corrupted men and drawn them into the conflict.Sadly the writers want to have their cake and eat it, so alongside this core theme we get some gleefully evil German villains who would clearly be more at home in a WWII setting. Wonder Woman is always fighting the Germans and never seems to really question whether the Triple Entente are any better. This isn't a hard choice, since it's the Germans here, and not the British, who are out to create super death gas (never mind the fact that both sides used chemical weapons during the actual war). I genuinely don't think that the movie ever really makes up its mind about which of its conflicting ideas is right, a non-trivial problem at the heart of the film.The motivation for the change of setting appears, to me at least, to have been largely aesthetic and probably driven by a desire for something less familiar than WWII. Director Patty Jenkins showed a shocking ignorance of this problem when she said ""World War I is...not something that we really know the history of."" This ignorance of the issues raised by this creative decision only increases the validity of these criticisms.It's a real shame because, action scenes aside, so much of the hard work to make this movie great is in place. The look and mood of the film and the casting choices are all spot on and the story could really have worked with more sensitivity and courage from the writers. As it is, the film must be seen as a decent, but undeniably flawed effort.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I mean that in a good way. It doesn't feel like a superhero movie. It's more like a mythology/period piece. And we finally have a DC movie with some decent jokes that don't feel out of place because the rest of the movie has such a dark tone. They're not on-par with Marvel's level of wit, but it's pretty dang close. And yes, DC has finally learned: Superhero movies can be fun. The acting was great, except for David Thewlis. I don't know what happened there. He was so good in the ""Harry Potter"" movies, but here, he hammed it up a bit too much to the point where it was almost laughable. The action sequences were well done and the score was also great. My only other criticism is the film did move a bit fast in the beginining. The exposition should have been drawn out a bit longer because it was hard for me to transition to the next part of the story that quickly. I'm surprised that so many people liked this. Not because it's a bad film. I enjoyed it too, but because as of late DC has been the scapegoat in the superhero movie game. So if this pleased even a bunch of nitpickers, then you know it's good.

This is a coming-of-age tale, an origin story, a romantic comedy, a 1918 period movie and a superhero genre tentpole flick all rolled into one blistering motion picture. This is a winner! Batman, Superman, Suicide Squad who?After a brief prologue set in modern day Paris, we are brought to the timeless mystical Island of Themyscira in an extended flashback sequence. We meet Diana, daughter of Amazon Queen, Hippolyta (Connie Nielssen). She longs to join the ranks as a fearsome Amazon warrior and her aunt, Antiope (Robin Wright) wants to train her. The story begins in earnest with the crash landing arrival of American spy Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) who works for British Intelligence whom Diana rescues. IMHO the brightest spot of Batman vs Superman is Wonder Woman. Here in her very own spotlight, she shines like a beacon of hope for the franchise. The casting of Gal Gadot is an inspired choice and her femininity and her strong character form a hypnotic aura around her. This is not femininity of the weak kind; she doesn't look into Chris Pine's blue eyes, disappear into them and forgets all her fighting skills. She is a woman with conviction and yet she is always inquisitive. She is athletic, strong, knows her purpose in life (even though it will take her a while to get there) and statuesque in her convictions. She has compassion and feels for the common folk. In short, she is a breath of fresh air. Gal Gadot is Wonder Woman.Wonder Woman (henceforth WW) is directed by a woman, Patty Jenkins, best known for Monster (2003) which won Charlize Theron the Best Actress Oscar. Her narrative voice is refreshingly distinctive and she blazes a new path for the overcrowded superhero genre. WW draws strength from Diana's growth in character and learning her ultimate place in humanity. As much as it is about that, it is also about a world torn by war earning their right to have her. This wise narrative trajectory gives the story gravitas and emotional heft. Most movies of this sort tend to embed an action scene every 10 minutes, but WW takes a different path and IMHO the quiet moments are also its strongest moments. Even when the action scenes rolled in, there is a ""never seen that before"" awesome feeling. The scene of Diana running head-on into the German front is superbly shot and has so much emotional power that I won't be forgetting that for a long time.Chris Pine is definitely Gadot's counterpart. Their chemistry feels genuine and I especially enjoy their double entendre dialogue. Pine's Steve Trevor is a man of that begotten time period, he doesn't react immediately after laying eyes on a beauty. He bides his time and treats her with respect; he earns the right to be with her by being who he is, a patriotic soldier and a chivalrous man. Tell me you don't want to see that more in these present times.Up to this point, I sound like I am describing a superhero genre masterpiece and if you scroll down and see my score, you will probably feel it doesn't commiserate with what was written. As much as I think it is a very satisfying movie, it derailed for me in the final act in the typical bombastic manner with which all the emotional built-up is thrown out the door and in its place comes the Defcon One city-leveller noise. Thankfully, Jenkins does anchor one particular scene with an emotional heft seldom seen. At 141 minutes, WW does require some judicious snips and the villains do deserve better. But all these don't take away the fact that it is the best movie in the DC extended universe to date. It is super fun, satisfying, dare I even say edifying, and in a genre populated by men, it takes a female hero and a female director to show in what new ways the game can be played.","3 out of 15 found this helpful.

I like pretty much every part of this film, from the amazing DC logo at the beginning of the film teasing the future of DC and Warner Bros.' cinematic universe to the acting to the script. An empowering film that represents women in film like none other before. Just think about the female lead superhero films that were predecessor of this film. (hmmm, Catwoman and Supergirl¬Ö¬Ö). On the point of having a whole new representation of women in film I have to say it was handled quite brilliantly and seamlessly. Patty Jenkins did not push the thing so much that it becomes on the ball and as many of you who have met the 'extreme feminists' may know, they do not represent women in their best light.Anyways, I thought that Gal Gadot and Chris Pine were both really good, and I very much liked the fish out of water situation depicted in both Themyscira and London. I thought that the film remained faithful to the source material in terms of this and also in terms of the costume. Gal Gadot is just so well casted in my opinion, despite the earlier criticisms. She nails it as Wonder Woman/Diana Prince, she sold the naivety act and still was able to sell bad ass combat sequences. Resulting in a very likable and strong female lead character. Another highlight I would like to mention is the opening scene on Themyscira, which once again focuses on the empowerment of women, but the whole battle sequence between the Amazons and the Germans was just so cool and exciting and Themyscira had such a great immersive and mystic aura I really enjoyed.Now about David Thewlis as Ares, I can see that they are going for the older NEw 52 Ares yet I personally would've liked to see the old blue armour wearing, more menacing version of the character. Although Thewlis is great and I can see the reasonings behind his casting I would've loved to see that younger and more threatening Ares, because at the end of the day Thewlis just seems like a rather nice guy.","3 out of 16 found this helpful.

We are writing reviews on movies. The plot of the movie is a princess of the amazons named Diana who is trained to fight. She meets a man named Steve and he tells her about the problems being causes in the real world. She leaves the Amazons and goes and fights through the war. What I noticed about the movie because of the time period was the special effects and the technology. The special effects were really good, so was the acting. There is nothing that made me question the historical accuracy of the film. There are no connections I made with any other movies with this one. I thought it was unique and told a different story. Three things I liked were the actors. I like the overall story. I also liked the special effects. One thing I didnt like was Steve Trevor dying. I thought the movie was good. I found it interesting and entertaining. I would want to see more movies with other actors.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

When meeting Ares she reaches for the sword (the one she lost easily in the previous fight, got beaten with it and then forgot it on the roof), the sword is not there, nothing happens then next scene she appeared to be coming down from the roof with the sword while Ares was waiting calmly (probably she asked him for a time out to go get the sword :) )","75 out of 175 found this helpful.

Without blatantly ripping off Captain America: The First Avenger and Thor (Thor: The Dark World) this Wonder Woman movie would be nothing. Without ""borrowing"" every element and ""Marvelizing"" the character, I'm betting all we'd have is another music video/Zack Snyder candy fart of a movie. So, instead of stoking the rivalry, DC fans should just say THANK YOU and move on. (Hoping that Justice League as copied Avengers) Overall, a pretty good movie BECAUSE the copied the MCU formula.BTW- Gal Gadot is awesome. Casting also saved this effort. She's got ravishingly good looks, the perfect physique and a pure innocent charm and confidence the character needed and that the camera eats up.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I liked some aspects of it and not so much others (I suppose like most films). At first I was really quite keen, as I liked how the young Diana was portrayed growing up, as someone keen to start (warrior) training, to become involved in battles and ultimately helping the outside world to conquer the Germans (its set in WWI). Surprisingly (or not), there were some reasonably poignant pieces of dialogue present - that impressed me, although perhaps the most memorable examples are in the very last scene. The titular character is of course portrayed as a, at heart, decent woman, wanting to help those who struggle to help themselves, which is, of course, laudable and yet I still feel there's an inherint tackiness to the over sexualised appearance of Wonder Woman. I suppose that inevitable to a certain extent but I felt that one or two such inevitable aspects cheapened or certainly lessened the potential impact of the good things. I'm sure most fans of such superhero films will enjoy this and I can't say its a bad film, it has some good themes and is somewhat thought provoking, plus the action/fight scenes are well filmed and the special effects are, of course, decent, as would be expected. For me, personally, overall I can't quite go so far as to give this a solid 4 star (good) rating but I'd say its a reasonable, ok watch if this is your kind of thing, certainly. If your not sure about it then don't. Oh and also, if you cringe at over the top/stereotyped Scottish characters then, suffice to say, you won't like the one who appears in this film - get ready to cringe!.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Thankfully however, we get a very good glance at the superhero's origins which means plenty of fulfilling action for the genre's greatest fans. Alike majority of superhero tales, there's the standard setup, buckets of action and an impressive execution. Most audiences are able to enjoy that, especially if discovering action-fantasy-adventures.Gal Gadot's performance as the protagonist isn't overly noticeable, but is fairly acceptable. The Wonder Woman is strong, clever and engaging, but is just like every other action flick hero you can think of. She's powerful, but her entire backstory... not as much.Why does this film deserve such high ratings as a satisfactory and basic story? Mainly because the action and battles are generally entertaining, but are visually gripping and what we were all expecting. For action fans, it's easily a fun journey to the cinema, but could've resulted as perfect if it were significantly shorter and less sluggish.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

She's definitely one of my favorite superheroes of all time, right beside Batman, Spiderman, The Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool. But in the case of her movie....it's basically rinse and repeat of every other DC superhero movie ever made, right down to the superhero landing, the epic one-on-one battle with everything blowing up and swords clashing and stuff.In terms of how accurate it is to the original comics, it gets a lot of things right but a few things wrong. For example, Diana becomes Wonder Woman only after winning the amazon games, Steve Trevor brings Diana to America, not London, and she appears in World War II and not the first world war.So did I like it? No, I didn't. I wanted to, but I couldn't bring myself to like it. Everything's rinse and repeat from the last DC films, and it doesn't have the humorous approach that marvel movies have taken in the last few years (Deadpool, Guardians 2, and Avengers; Age of Ultron) But that's the thing. It really depends whether you want ""comic"" book heroes or Comic book ""heroes."" I don't think it's a bad movie, but I didn't like it. It's exactly like every other DC superhero film i've seen, except in this case, the protagonist has boobs.Oh yeah, and Lynda Carter and Lyle Waggoner didn't cameo in this film. Finally! Not that I wouldn't love to see Lynda in a movie...But the cameo thing has been done to death in recent years.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

That says a lot for me because I am a cheapskate and had paid for a double feature. I couldn't bear to wait through this one for the other.It was a pretty film, but as with many others in the current generation, fell way short in content. Kind of a beauty is only skin deep kind of thing. My daddy always told me that it was the heart and soul that counts, and this movie has none of that. It was full of tired clich√©s, presented in a way that made me feel somehow like the director was a cheesy 1950's misogynist trying to make a buck off of girls and women for which he had no real respect.It is a wonder women allowed themselves to be represented this way, but hey, maybe it redeemed itself in the second half.

But she proved me and a lot of others wrong since she was WONDERful. (I just had to.) She perfectly embodies the Amazonian warrior princess with a lot of heart and childlike innocence, which made for so many fun fish out of water moments (which is a phrase Aquaman gets offended by).The score was amazing, Themyscira was beautiful, and I loved the contrast between the vibrancy of Paradise Island and the grey bleakness of WWI. The movie also touches on gender roles without it ever feeling forced or cringey. Chris Pine was charming as ever as Steve Trevor. The relationship he builds with Diana not only showcased their chemistry, but it was a relationship I actually cared about.But not every character worked. The villains sucked. Forgettable, underdeveloped, generic, etc. Any time we focused on them everything grinded to a halt. Since this movie is also +2 hours long, the pacing can rise and dip, especially with how much time they take to set everything up.Many of the action sequences were awesome though, especially that No Man's Land trench scene. It doesn't get any more badass than fighting an entire army solo with nothing but a sword and shield. But they could have relaxed a bit on the slow-mo.Moreover, that final fight in the third act was just a complete swing and a miss. It felt like a different movie. The tone shifts from this grounded journey to some CGI-infested, explosion-filled epic battle. This time around, I even noticed that the CGI was not at all that impressive. In fact, everything looked very cartoony like a video game cutscene.Overall, Wonder Woman was fun, entertaining, and full of heart, despite some minor problems that hold the movie back from being something special. Can't WAIT for WW84!Score: 8 out of 10
Overall: GreatThanks for reading!","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

actually Wonder Woman was a less budgeted film than other dc movies,the visual effects of the film were bad, of course because of the low budget,I didn't find the film's visual effects enough, but it was a nice superhero movie.I like the film to pass in time of world war,there wasn't much action, so there was no big war.Last scene contained really good messages and was very emotional.I wish I would continue the movie at the same time, but I think we will return to the present, at least Batman will participate in the film.But the main reason why so much appreciation is collected is that I think the universe that is different and that it is really a world war.I like this movie most among the dc movies,it would be a super movie if they were spending so much money.At the beginning of the film was passed too quickly to pass the subject just wanted to tell the life of a little wonder woman, but could be more beautiful.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Likable, relatable, interesting characters. Exceptional performances and emotional editing. The fight scenes have a bit of CGI that is easy to get passed due to the fun and exciting actions scenes. Good fun humor. The villain feels a little forced and unbelievable.

If there is one that is going to come out soon; you better believe I already know about it. I usually walk away enjoying them very much (giving the scores 7, 8 or 9 on a regular basis). Now I am not saying it is a bad movie as you can tell by the 7 stars listed above. It is just getting more praise than it really deserves.When I first heard about the plan for the movie; I thought well it is going to take place in World War I, Steve Trevor is going to be involved, and Wonder Woman will have to stop the Germans. This sounds familiar but as I watched, the films felt relatively more and more similar. The other movie I am talking about is Captain America the First Avenger. Now this is a non spoiler review so I can't give details in why I think these two are so similar but a lot of big plot points remind me of the Cap movie. Currently WW is sitting at an 8.4 and with this many votes I can't see it going below a 7.4, and with Cap at a surprising 6.9 it leaves me scratching my head as both were good.Now with that point out of the way, I will say this movie did something very well. Presenting a very nice relationship between Steve and Diana. Steve and Peggy were my top duo but I think how there characters in Wonder Woman were written Steve and Diana take first in the chemistry department. Pine's great comedic one liners along with the compassion and kindness he showed Diana really made him a likable character (and to top it off he is Chris Pine). The other thing that made the movie was the villain reveal. It was a refreshing way to thrown the character out there and it was really awesome.The bad besides the for-mentioned similar-esque story. The Dr. Poison character really was wasted. She was given just terrible lines of dialogue. That was the cringe in the movie, just clich√© villain talk. A problem that probably just bugs me but the needless comedy in the movie. MCU does this on a regular basis and it is beginning to annoy me now and I don't want DC to use it. I enjoy the gloom and DC should stick with it, there doesn't need to be scenes just for the laugh as there are some here.Wonder Woman is a good movie but it is not some sub-genre defining movie. If you are someone who does not go out of there way to watch superhero movies; I think it is okay to wait for this to be released on Blu-ray or whatever your preference.I will say 7.2/10","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Gal Gabot plays the Amazing Amazon Woman aka Wonder Woman who was created by the all powerful Zeus and raised to be the ulitmate warrior and defender of the earth. Now that we have our introduction of the film written let's get into reviewing this film. Wonder Woman aka Diana had never seen a man and when a WWII pilot crashes on the secluded island and goes to save him because it's in her nature to save humanity and becomes fascinated by Steve Trevor played by Chris Pine. Steve opens up Diana world with learning how to act in society from dancing and dressing in normal clothing. The film takes place in WWII when war is everywhere and Diana wants to help take down her enemies Aries who is really another name for Hitler if you ask me BUT let's not split hairs here. During the war scenes is when Diana really shows her true strength and some of my favorite scenes. I wasn't a huge Wonder Woman when I was growing up but this film was really entertaining and made me look up the TV show and get some comic books from the library and when a movie can do that it's a win win for me. Should you watch this film? Well if you like superhero films then yes, you'll like this film. The first female superhero to be number one at the Box Office and make 700 Million dollars so far isn't bad for a girl power film. If you're not sure about the film rent it on Redbox it'll only cost you a few dollars but you'll enjoy it.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

She carries the film with eye candy off the chart alone, and without being overly gratuitous about it. Everybody has to say '""dayum!"" whenever the camera is on her from any angle for more than a split second. Credit must be given to Gadot for presenting the ultimate female as sweetly lovable and smart besides her super powers.

The premise of the film is set 100 years before Batman V Superman and sees Diana have to leave her home in order to track down The God Of War Ares and attempt to stop World War 1.Main Character
Gal Gadot is back as Wonder Woman in this film and she does a great job in this film, I kind of wish this film was her introduction as it is a great character piece and you see her develop so much throughout the film. She looks the part and fills the role very well, she is charming and stubborn but you grow to care about and I must say to this point she was easily the most fleshed out character in this universe after the job they did with Superman in Dawn Of Justice.Supporting Characters
Chris Pine plays Steve Trevor in this film and I thought he did a really good job, he usually plays the macho charismatic male lead so it is nice seeing him in this role where he is the less dominant character on screen. He is an interesting character aswell, the dynamic between him and Gadot is fantastic and it is one of the most believable partnerships that I have seen recently. There is also a character in this film Charlie played by Ewan Bremner who is a fascinating character and leads to some dark moments in this film that makes him a more interesting characters. The film falls down though on it's villains, they are all so over the top, they feel like they are from a different movie, everybody else feels like they are in an important dramatic film but they came from an over the top 80's film.Story
The film has a really interesting story, it is about a character from a paradise learn about the real world and how men aren't perfect and everybody makes mistakes. Learning about this character and her motivations is really fascinating as you see her deal with men for the first time and the huge thing that is World War 1. I know some people crticise the last act but I thought the story elements worked for the film and provided some really emotional moments and you see why she is the character she is in present day.Script
The script is really good, it is the first film in the DCEU to this point to really hit the blend between drama and humour, I laughed when I was supposed to, the drama hit some emotional moments and it really did a great job of improving this film.Style
The style of the film has some good action scenes and has a really effective setting. There is some issues though, the overuse of slow motion is a detriment, every action scene has some sort of slow motion and it feels lazy. Also the last act of the film goes down to the generic CGI action scene and it is really genric. Though I will say this film includes one of the greatest moments in Comic Book films ever in my opinion, if you have seen this film you know what moment I am talking about.Overall
Overall, this is a great origin film and does a great job in building up the character of Wonder Woman. There are some things that can be improved in the future but this is a great start.Rating - 8/10.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Thankfully, its second act is much better. It provides a few thrills (although some of those rely too heavily on speed ramping and intangible CGI) and several nice character interactions, making excellent use of the palpable chemistry between its two leads. There's a solid chunk of the movie - about an hour, I'd say - that I don't really have any complaints with; it's genuinely good and, even, feels like it has the potential to be great. It deals with interesting and somewhat unexpected themes, while presenting its protagonist's believable na√Øvet√© as a flaw for her to overcome. Then, the third act rolls around and the flick frustratingly stops short of completing its central arc. Instead, a final villainous reveal occurs, leading not only to an over-the-top and CGI-fuelled battle that proves DC haven't learned from their past mistakes, but also to an odd undercutting of the affair's apparent main message. It's frustrating precisely because the film so close to being something so good. Still, it isn't bad overall, even if it's far from the masterpiece some are claiming it to be. For the most part, it hits the tone and messages it aims for. During its mid-section, it's exciting and enjoyable. Its, frankly, terrible first act and its disappointing third do bring it down significantly, though. Still, considering the quality (or lack thereof) of its immediate predecessors, it's a surprisingly decent entry in the DCEU. 6/10.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

This is what exactly happened to me with Wonder Woman, i don't call it an average affair, it was a very good film and fulfilled those normal expectations but somewhere fell inches short to that high expectations level. Let me talk about every individual field :- Acting - Gal Gadot is Fantastic as Wonder Woman, but believe me she looks damn hot and distracts your attention from Acting. I think the whole idea was to make her look attracting and distract people from 'An Actor Gal Gadot'. Other star cast got nothing big and noticeable to do but they all were fairly good.Writing - We have seen WW's glimpse in BvS so when you visit her earlier life there has to be something satisfying reason and there is some great writing to set a plot to the glory of First Lady Superhero. Some logical mistakes are there but let it be.VFX and Action - Action sequences are brilliant, much better in slow motion. VFX work is good but 3D effects aren't up to the mark. Just for 5-6 minutes 3D effects scenes you have to wear irritating glasses for 2 hours.Cinematography - Good but nothing new. Few vertical and horizontal angles lefts an impression.Background Music - Excellent ! In Fight sequences Background score lifts the tempo up to the next level. And it's suitable for the Era shown in film.Direction - Thank god Zack Snyder wasn't director here, he disappointed with BvS so choosing Patty Jenskine has worked for DCEU. I can say she has given the Best film so far to DCEU. And i think choosing a woman director for a lady superhero film gave it some boost.Final Words - Overall Wonder Woman is not a Must Watch film but it is not a film to miss either. It completes normal expectations but slightly disappoints High Expectations, now it's up to you what you are expecting from a film. I'm giving 7/10* and i think this film will surpass everyone's expectation as a viewer and on Box Office too.","2 out of 13 found this helpful.

I saw fight sequences that were evocative of the ""Thor"" and ""Captain America"" films, heard dialogue that could have been lifted from ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Age of Ultron."" The first 20 minutes of ""Wonder Woman"" brought to mind the teen film ""Percy Jackson: The Lightening Thief."" And the overall visual sensibility suggests Director Patty Jenkins was taking her direction from Zack Snyder, giving the movie the look of Snyder's own ""Sucker Punch.""But Gal Godot radiates charisma. She is worth every dollar of the admission price, every minute spent watching ""Wonder Woman."" It is her performance that elevates the movie from blatant rip-off to credible homage. Gal Godot projects honesty, integrity and likability the equal of Tom Cruise or Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson at their best. She moves from innocent bemusement to fearsome obsession, from a fish out of water to the baddest shark in the ocean with such believability that I am stung the movie around her is not up to her performance. DC gets lucky with ""Wonder Woman."" They hung the future of their movie universe on possibly the only actress who could carry that load. As a bonus, there is also the Wonder Woman theme; something about this song feels primal. It may be my favorite theme from any movie, ever.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw_o7XUX3fg","2 out of 13 found this helpful.

Yes, I'm not kidding. It is not just very well written, creative, but also extremely philosophically deep. Though a fantasy genre, the plot was sufficiently enough to keep the suspension of disbelief and allow the character and the story to be realistic and relatable.The creativity is how it seamlessly transitioned from what appeared as an ancient Greek fantasy to a very convincing WW1 historical drama and then ultimately an action hero flick. I was astounded by the amount of detail and production value of each transition. I mean, because they were transitioning from various themes, I wasn't expecting them to go into the details of WW1 costumes and set as the level of movies like 1917, which was intently focused on that era and genre.However, as I've said the most amazing is the depth of philosophy behind the story, which honestly I think most people would not pick up unfortunately. Similar to Superman IV - the Quest for Peace, WW came to the same conclusion that peace cannot be achieved by the desire of 1 person, even if he or she was a super hero. Another word, with all she was capable of, she could not actually save the world. Only love can, and it is a choice humanity has to choose for themselves.It was also very deep in explaining that though Ares was responsible for tempting and influencing men to war, but ultimately man always had a choice and as Steve Trevor puts it, ""We're all to blame."" This is a very humble attitude on life and taking responsibility for our actions rather than always shifting blame.Wonderfully made, a masterpiece.","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

She can block lightning and other stuff through her hands. The animation or CGI is execellent. It is good to have Steve Trevor there for the romance. The setting is awesome. The slow-motion scene is also great. On the other hand, I have a problem in music in the end while Wonder Woman is fighting Ares. I don't feel the music. Also, some fighting scenes should be improve just like when she was fighting the soldiers inside a house. Lastly, I feel very cheesy when Wonder woman said that ""I believe in love"" but it is okay.

But one day a World War Two American soldier washes up on the shaw of the island and tells them of the terrible war going on she decides to go with him back to the war and fight.For the first act of this film I wasn't very into it. I thought that the two main characters were good but nothing to great and there were some attempts at humour that fell pretty flat.However there was a part were a few new characters got introduced and suddenly the film got way more interesting. The new characters were very funny and charming but at that point the already existing character became more interesting. The relationship between the young girl or Wonder Woman, or though she's never referred as that in the film, and the American solder, played by Gal Gadot and Chris Pine, felt really realistic and they had really good chemistry. The villains, of which there are about three, two were kinda bland but still mildly interesting. The other one was I thought was really cool and well done and performed. It also did a really good job of making it seem like you were in a World War Two setting. Apart from the line ""well that's neat"" all the dialogue sounded like it was from a person from 1940's. Now lets talk about the best part of the film, the action. I'm not kidding when I say that I think this film has some of the best fight scenes I've ever seen in a film ever. The film has about three big action scenes which are all amazing, but it doesn't action non stop all the time, it's balanced out by character moments that were really good as well. The action was so well shot and unlike other films with lots of action I never got bored at all. It was so cool and exciting and I would recommend Wonder Woman to anyone who's a fan of really exciting and well done action movies with good character.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I don't know much about the Wonder Woman comics but other than the origin story within a flashback thing the film never really gets bogged down with excessive nerdy details. Enough of the world was explained to be understandable with enough of the world being unexplained to be engaging. It struck a nice balance of telling a single story while opening up the universe to be explored. The only major down side is the silly comic book villain that shows up in the 3rd act. Add in that Thewlis is horribly miscast as that character and really the film nearly comes off the rails by the end. I suspect Jenkins lost a few fights in the 3rd act.In the final analysis, however, that problem amounts to very little. Jenkins fills the film with a lot of lyrical images. Unlike Snyder she realizes that beauty is derived from meaning and doesn't just create empty spectacle. Her direction coupled with the period aspects of the story provide a refreshing change of light optimism for the DCCU that is usually so needlessly dour.This film was a surprise. It is actually good!","4 out of 6 found this helpful.

This simple premise with a World War I setting, and Wonder Woman's perspective is an excellent opportunity to create a gripping narrative about the dichotomy of the human condition that is war and peace.However, poor representation of WWI leaves the premise feeling hollow and empty, as well as missing out on excellent opportunities to flesh out the narrative more deeply.WWI is a war that was caused by a mess of interlocking treaties and a series of seminal events, thus there were no good or bad sides in the war, but Wonder Woman attempts to portray the Germans as being the ""bad guys"" as they were the only ones in the film to use chemical weapons. The film's attempt to portray the cruelties of war missed out on vital opportunities such as gas attacks, wave attacks against machine gun positions, and shell-shock caused by enduring artillery bombardments from days on end. Another opportunity missed are the Christmas day truce which would've shown the good side of humanity in war.Greek mythology was also warped for this film - which was disappointing.The movie is also hampered by a predictable plot, plot holes, and cliche's that are more fitting for a Saturday cartoon. The film also doesn't go into depth about the Amazons - which would've been another opportunity to show contrast between the paradise island Wonder Woman grew up in, and the trying times of the early 20th Century.The CGI is decent, though there are parts where it becomes obvious that the scene is a green screen. Action is decent enough, but is lackluster in the final battle.I will give this movie props for not making it one huge gender vs gender fest, but rather a cooperative story that acknowledges the sexism that was existent during the early 20th century.A lot could've been done to make Wonder Woman a better movie, but alas it is not.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

This one is about the Amazon beauty called Wonder Woman.The rage has usually been to go for blinding, numbing special effects and hate mongering demonic love, particularly with the Beavis and Butthead approach to the Batman series.This one goes back to basics. It has special effects, but they're on the side, not the front. There is too much use of special effects in this movie, but at least time out is taken for story and characters. And the love for demons isn't here. Instead, we get more of a mortal look at real people you can find credible.The gusto and bravery of the Amazon women is explained, so we can understand their fearlessness. When Wonder Woman meets the mortal men in combat, she finds a different credibility.In fact, this film is very symbolic of the times that the first world culture has entered. First world culture has produced a slew of bubble boys who think they are as fearless as the Amazon tribe. One way to identify these bubble boys and girls is if they claim they would be like the Amazon women or the other fearless characters. If so, they've labeled themselves as the very people this film is identifying.So, the creators of this film let them stand in with Wonder Woman herself, to see the frailty of Man. Unfortunately, the point will be moot with these viewers. They will not see themselves among the mortals. They'll continue in their bubbles. Still, this film does make the effort.As of this date, most Americans, most first world people, at least those who don't live in poverty, haven't an inkling about the horrors of war. Oh, they claim they know, and love the hate mongering demon worshiping movies, but if they really had pain in their lives, they wouldn't need to look for pain. In fact, most of them will not like this film, because it isn't demonic enough for them. Hopefully, they can stay in their bubbles and never know horror.But this is a pretty good film. I would rather see fewer special effects. Less dulling play from special effects people. I suppose they have to prove they can do it, but it is dull. Sane viewers, like myself, would rather see the story and characters.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

However, like everything in this earthly life, the exuberant actress had to say goodbye to her time of victory, leaving as a reminder an unblemished legacy, inherent nostalgia emerging from this character and seven decades of vignettes that made the delights of comic lovers of yesteryear. However, the social, political and cultural phenomenon threatens to come out again thanks to the triumph of a war/comic/superhero/dramatic/romantic‚Äîand before all these banal classifications‚Äîinspirational and transcendent production, which was conceived by director Patty Jenkins next to new and perfect Wonder Woman actress, Gal Gadot, of course, with the extensive assistance of a unisex crew, captained economically, by American monster film production company Warner Bros.As a general rule, each released movie must follow, at least, a specific storyline in connection with the universe that the studio wishes to put together, such as its counterpart Marvel Studios, because of which, the events are placed just after the ending of ""Batman V Superman"", with a seasoned and circumspect Diana Prince receiving a package, which motivates the corresponding presentation of her origins, using as a narrative conductor a shabby photograph taken on her first vacation to the harsh, fierce and paradoxically inhumane real world: the World War I. However, the film slides much further back, promptly to Themyscira, Diana's origin land and an idyllic Greek kingdom where the most powerful, clever and complete females reside, thanks to work and grace of Zeus in order to inspire peace and union in a world tamed by Ares brutality, the main rival of both the father of the gods and the Amazon warriors, a tribe led by overprotective Queen Hippolyta and her sister, General Antiope. The hurdle that, sooner or later, they had to face will come after Steve Trevor, pilot and spy of the United States Army, who accidentally falls into the ocean of the island with a bundle of horrid realities under his arms, forcing the predicted awakening of Wonder Woman.It was neither for lack of intent nor because of scarcity of support and execution sources, it was by a shortage of professionalism that the superheroines world had not had the succor that male heroes possess today. However, the American huge studios ‚Äî so similar but so dissimilar ‚Äî have taken matters into their own hands, either by the unfading desire of fans or by the boom around the absolute abolition of misogyny in the different human fields. Warner Brothers Pictures was the one which took the initiative several years ago, using Zack Snyder as casting director to finally select Gal Gadot, the Wonder Woman from cover to cover by reason of her acting skills and dominant emotional strength as she pops on the screen. While the company was recovering from the colossal setback that meant the inaugural stage of its cinematic universe ‚Äî incited by Christopher Nolan's near excellent trilogy ‚Äî at the hands of the grandiloquent ""Man of Steel"" (2013), a vilified and muddled ""BvS"" (2016) and the oversaturated and decaffeinated ""Suicide Squad"" (2016); the high members deliberated what would be the course that the mega project should take, since although all previous movies had a lucky reception at the box office, they don't convince any one within critics circle. Then, the next step fell into the hands of Jenkins, a director whose experience was strictly based on the small screen and her prestigious directorial debut: ""Monster"", which Charlize Theron won an Academy Award. The writers' and the filmmaker's ambitions to bring back ""WW"" were so fervent, fascinating and prevailing that the company gave a vote of confidence for an Amazon princess with a nuance much more from Marvel, she is who lifted that vile shade flying over DC, once and for all. And what a success! With a smaller budget, besides other productions, this origin story communicates an anti-war message of brotherhood and innocence through the different angles that story touches, from her formation as a warrior until the frigid and cutting confrontation with the land of men. Sequences as the ascension of the walls of a high tower, the sublime struggle in the arenas of Themyscira, the combat in the village against the German officers or the self-same Zeus or her already classic allegorical scene in which she arises among bullets and explosions, encouraged by the masterful composition of Hans Zimmer; A portentous setting, cinematography and photography that remind the work of ""Fantastic Beasts""; first-grade special effects that, although on several occasions are perceptible and somewhat ineffective, draw each of the locations and struggles with an enviable sophistication, a story brimming with love and bravery ‚Äî thanking a fascinating twist ‚Äî; high octane performances and a direction teaching in each frame, all that make ""Wonder Woman"" a wonderful and, for someones, painful triumph.","11 out of 23 found this helpful.

However it wasn't all that easy for this character to become the iconic figure she is today. Sexism (at least in regards to Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman), has come a long way. And after years of overcoming such hurdles - here we are, the unthinkable became a reality and Wonder Woman has finally arrived in her own major motion picture.Although I was quite delighted that there was finally going to be a Wonder Woman on the big screen, I will admit I was quite skeptical at first of Gal Gadot playing the part (absolutely and 100% nothing personal), and I laid open that if I were wrong about this conclusion that I would admit I was erroneous via my skepticism. A part of me thought 'if this rarity of Wonder Woman on the big screen gets screwed up, it won't be given another chance in a very long time'. I now understand why they went for a slightly more slender look - there was a fair bit of backlash with that decision due to the fact that when most people think Wonder Woman, the first thing that comes to mind is her immeasurable strength, but many of us forget how immensely swift and agile she can be. Thus this is why Gal Gadot's appearance and/or how she was portrayed complimented the best of both worlds, and is why it really seemed to have worked in this film. That been said my congratulations to Gal Gadot, Patty Jenkins and Zack Snyder. The film was absolutely extraordinary, and my uncertainties can finally be put to rest. As for Chris Pine playing the role of Steve Trevor. Hey it's Chris Pine were talking about... of course he pulled off the part splendidly! The rest of the cast was meritable and they complimented one another quite fittingly.Finale Verdict: What made this picture work was how everything seemed to have flowed in near perfect harmony, from screen writing and production, to cast and crew - the end result was nothing short of spectacular. What intrigued me most was they took classic Wonder Woman Lore, and still managed to fuse modernized mythos into the story. The beauty about this Superhero film in particular is whether you're a Wonder Woman comic reader or not, this motion picture delivers for both readers and non readers alike. Although I had a couple minor qualms, they were so minuscule that they aren't even worth mentioning. Not only is Wonder Woman an inspiration to women and girls around the world, but men and boys alike. So go out and see this 'Wonder' on the big screen, you won't regret it!","11 out of 23 found this helpful.

Everyone seems to board the hype train, but honestly...it's not that great. Don't get me wrong, Wonder Woman is an interesting movie. Has all the known elements of superhero-origins type movies: the secret back story, the loving parent, the loving trainer, the discovery of the powers, the finding of the truth, the love interest, the super-villain, the comic relief, etecetera, etecetera...and that's it! The only ""novelty"" here is that the superhero is a woman, the rest is same old, same old. The acting is decent, as per expected in a superhero movie, nothing real special, no Oscars here. Gal Gadot does a wonderful job as Wonder Woman, as she portrays beauty and a bad ass perfectly, personally I liked it very much, the rest of the cast are there to support the hero, so no one shines brighter than Gadot, and maybe no one should, so, as I said before: decent acting, nothing big here. The Special effects are decent, but also, nothing real special...probably they could and should have done better. Sound effects and soundtrack are good, perhaps the best thing about the movie. The Wonder Woman theme is very adequate, and gives the right mood, but even that was created in Batman VS Superman...so, once again, no novelty... The directing and production are also as expected for a superhero movie: Good wardrobe, beautiful locations, action scenes, superpowers and explosions. So, where does Wonder Woman excel? What does it do differently than the other 5 or 6 superhero movies that comes out every year? What makes it so special? In my opinion: Nothing! Not a single thing. It's superhero movie by the numbers. Entertainment at it's best, but not a special movie, not something we will talk about in 2 or 3 years, not a game changer. My best guess is, it's polical correctness at it's prime once again. A superhero movie, with a female superhero and a woman directing, it can't be anything short of great. But, really, it isn't. It's on the same level as ""Captain America"", ""BatmanVSSuperman"" and most of the superhero movies: Great entertainment popcorn movies to spend a good 2 hours. Don't expect to be mind blown...","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

The reason? I had almost reached the end of my rope with DC Universe movies. I hated ""Man of Steel"", ""Suicide Squad"" was a well-polished disappointment, and ""Batman vs Superman"" was almost comically inept. As such, I really had no desire to give DC films any more of my time. However, with all the good ""WW"" reviews and word-of-mouth, I finally relented (it being released in 4K helped tremendously on that front). What I found was a surprisingly competent and entertaining film that (at least for a moment) breathes a little bit of new life into the DC film franchise.For a basic plot summary, ""Wonder Woman"" tells the story of Diana (Gal Gadot), a woman living on an island of Amazons whose sole purpose are to protect the world from Ares, the God of War. While training to become a warrior, Diana witnesses the crashing of a military plane piloted by WWI spy Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). When he explains the state of the world to Diana (the scope of WWI), she is convinced that Ares must be acting through German general Ludendorff (Danny Huston) and his demented chemist Dr. Maru (Elena Anaya). As such, Diane defies her people and leaves the island, wishing to be brought to the Front of the war to take on Ares herself.The fact that the plot of this film is set up so simply really serves ""Wonder Woman"" well, I think. Instead of trying to create a complicated scenario, director Patty Jenkins realizes that the success of the movie hinges on the character interactions, overall message, and action sequences.Let's take a quick look at those things one at a time:-The action sequences are thrilling. DC always does a good job with that. -The overall message is one of positivity and hope. Because Diana is so foreign to our culture, her viewpoint of humanity is quite instructive and fuels much of the movie. -The character interactions are the hallmark of the film, however. Gadot & Pine have incredible chemistry, and their scenes carry much of the experience.Is ""Wonder Woman"" a perfect film? No. A few things came off as a bit too silly for me, and it isn't really as deep as, say, ""Batman Begins"" was. But considering where the DC universe films were heading, ""WW"" is a HUGE step back in the right direction.I'm still wary of pretty much all things DC (I have not and will not see ""Justice League"" in theaters), but ""Wonder Woman"" stood out in a good way. Put Zack Snyder behind the camera again and it all probably comes crashing down.

Gal has very limited range and seems more like a privileged catwalk model with two facial expressions and no muscular definition, than an Amazonian warrior. She will get away with this due to the fact that mediocrity often receives high praise nowadays as people demand more polish and less substance. Shows like the X factor are no doubt partially responsible.The 3 main villains have no depth and deliver their lines abysmally. The director and producers must be to blame for at least some of this. Chris Pine, whom I usually quite like, was pretty pointless and unnecessary.The story is such a pool of bile that its impressive only for it's terribleness. It is a twisted wreck of clich√©s the like of which we HAVE seen before, only maybe not quite this bad!I write this as a pro equality male with no anti feminist agenda and am honestly disappointed and annoyed that a movie that could have been a great vehicle to bring a heroine with a message of hope to the big screen to counteract all the recent dark and testosterone ridden nonsense, has turned out to be a pink tractor with no wheels and an exhaust that spews bull's faeces It this is the kind of movie that is getting more positive than negative reviews on sites like metacritic and rotten tomatoes, then I am glad to consider myself out of touch with the critics.

The story makes sense from the start of the movie when the queen of the amazons explains their origins. From the moment Chris Pine's character appears on wards the movie sort of takes off(no pun intended). The finale was good enough, nothing too surprising, but surprising enough and well done.All in all, a great block buster, do yourself a favor and watch it.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

When a fighter pilot (Chris Pine) crash lands onto her home island, the title character (Gadot) decides to go to his world to defeat the Greek god of war, Ares, thus ending the war.This movie follows a traditional superhero movie formula. There are very few surprises in the story, but there is enough charm to make up for that.Gal Gadot gave a show-stealing performance in Batman v Superman, and her version of Wonder Woman holds up as the front and center of her own movie. She pulls off the warrior attitude very well, but also has moments of wonder and naivete, as she is introduced to the unfamiliar human world. She also has great chemistry with Chris Pine, who acts as a love interest for her.The tone is also much more lighthearted than previous DC movies. It isn't nearly as upbeat and funny as The Avengers or Guardians of the Galaxy, but it is definitely a move away from the darkness of Man of Steel and Batman v Superman.However, it is still held back by its unoriginal story, and by its overlong run-time of two and a half hours. But if you don't mind seeing the same old superhero origin story, Wonder Woman is a perfectly decent superhero movie.jaythemovieguy.blogspot.com","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

It is by far the best DC installment thus far; which isn't saying much, but I would also say that it compares competitively with the recent Marvel installments.Director Patty Jenkins' film stretches over 141 minutes, and unlike most superhero story lines, Wonder Woman never really extends unnecessarily past what was appropriate.Gal Gadot's performance is astonishing and powerful in this film as she was able to show the emotions of love, sorrow, motivation, innocence, and sincerity beautifully and bravely. As the first female dominant superhero film in over a decade, Gadot delivers an inspirational message to her audience about the strength of women.The humor was thoroughly enjoyable and never forced. The film found a great balance between humor, action, and drama while depicting a hero's journey and delivering a story full of purpose.Director of Photography Matthew Jensen shot impressive action sequences along with dramatic scenes to pull together a well-rounded and well-shot story. Also Jenkins' color schemes throughout the film, especially Wonder Woman's color of blue, gold, and orange, make the scenes more emotional and alluring ‚Äî that along with the beautiful music score.A couple critical opinions: First, I was hoping for more depth in Chris Pine's character (Captain Trevor). As Diana slowly became assimilated into modern culture and behaviors, it would have been more fulfilling to see human emotions, like real jealousy and frustration, through Pine, instead of constant bewilderedness and humorous anxiety. Additionally, I think the film failed to grasp the concept of warfare's harsh and incomprehensible realities, even though there were several opportunities to do so.Second, as beautiful was the fight choreography and photography, the action sequences could have cut down on the Slo-Mo, and instead could have let the action run normally to depict the enjoyable confusion and speed of melee combat. The editing was impressive and cool, just a little over the top.Overall, Wonder Woman was a beautiful film, one that I think is necessary for today's society. I hope this film further carries the motion for more strong and inspirational female leads.","9 out of 18 found this helpful.

That is all.I will elaborate. Slow, clich√© driven, anti climatic and over all transparent. I saw nothing of it before sitting in the theater. The big reveal, ARES, was obvious from the tone and setting of his first scene.They made the main reveals painfully clear from the onset. What set Diana apart from the other Amazons, Ares, a relationship predestined for a tragic end, all of it was instantly recognizable. No surprises, whatsoever.There were numerous, poor attempts at humor. Which seems to be a trade mark for DC films.I struggled to stay awake for the first half hour, until Diana snuck off with bae to the world of Man and even then, it had minimal entertainment value. We watch Diana discover (and to her credit, Gal Gadot did make it seem more, or less, authentic) how the world was outside of the borders of her home land and fail to blend in. Though, ""blending in"" never seemed to be a high priority for her. She was SINGULARLY driven to kill ares. Which she did, very anti-climatically. Poor writing at it's finest. Diana Prince is a very one dimensional character. Which, to be honest, embodies the whole mythos of Wonder Woman, perfectly. So, I am not sure I can use that as a detraction. As the character was faithfully represented.Oh, and the on screen deaths of important characters were, more or less, pointless and apathetic. We had no reason to care for them, at all. Tertiary character development was even worse than for primary characters. Shakespeare, this was not.I have more criticism, but it would be beating a dead horse after saying the characters are undeveloped, the movie is slow paced and the ending leaves much to be desired.Now for the highlights.Gal Gadot nailed the role. (and is gorgeous.)The sometimes hokey CG and fight scenes don't really detract from the over all high quality of production for the film. It was certainly done well.It was slightly more entertaining than Captain America: The First Avenger. Granted, that's not a high bar to jump, but if Cap can get 3 movies, I expect WW to get at least that many. (despite the lack luster first outing)Gal Gadot is gorgeous! Did I already mention that? Oh well, it deserves to be said again. I spent more time entertained by close up shots of her face, than everything else combined.Note: I found it funny that the entire Amazon race (those who spoke) had to learn Gal Gadot's accent, rather than simply teaching Gal Gadot to have an American accent. I suppose it had to be done, since she was already in BvS with the accent. However, with all the flaws of this film, picking on the accent seems petty. Overall, it's a 6 out of 10. I will watch it again, but on red box. I only give it a 1 star rating, because many over hyped it and decided it was the best movie, ever and it certainly was not. Also Gal Gadot is incredibly gorgeous. Have I said that before? Ahhh, well...it can't be over stated.","23 out of 47 found this helpful.

I went to see ""Wonder Woman"" with mediocre expectations and got totally blown away. For me growing up with Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman on TV it was going to take some doing for me to get that blown away feeling. Well I got a nuke dropped on me, because DC finally lives up to all the hype it got on this one. Gal Gadot is the new ""Wonder Woman"" and leaves all the rest from the past in her dust. She is simply amazing along with the story, the characters, villains, and visual effects. Even along the way I heard chuckle's and laughter as little one liners and good humor was sprinkled in. The movie had that all along with a little romance and deep feelings thrown in. Even the side kicks for Steve Trevor were colorful and well done. I really enjoyed ""The Chief"" played by Eugene Brave Rock, he made a comment to Wonder Woman in the movie about the war, and what it was destroying and said his people were destroyed by Steve Trevor meaning the white man a long time ago. Lots of thought went into the script dialogue and this is DC's crowning jewel for Wonder Woman and women in general.

Framing the entire narrative as a photographic flashback is an appreciated reflexive and nested-story device. I love the scene in the alley where she stops a bullet and drops her glasses √† la Christopher Reeve in ""Superman"" (1978). Gal Gadot, having already been the best part of ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" (2016), is great, and the supporting cast is good enough. The No Man's Land scene is a perfect instance of superheroic gravitas. The score by Rupert Gregson-Williams helps, including reusing the Wonder Woman theme song. The babe-in-the-woods act is a lot of fun, while the depicted virtue of her anti-war warrior mission during WWI rather puts our complacency in perspective. Yeah, we should be more horrified by battle, more repulsed by ugly London landscapes, indignant of dresses you can't fight in, and happy about cute babies and ice cream. So successful was this that it looks like ""Wonder Woman 1984"" (2020), as based on the trailers, will be simply gender-reversing this dichotomy between Gadot's Diane Prince and Chris Pine's Steve Trevor.Aside from the tired boss fight at the end and the occasional jarring cut to a superhero pose after a series of fast-cut CGI shots, director Patty Jenkins and company did well to put everything together--even with the slow-motion shots seemingly required by the genre. Reflecting on past pandemics in 2020, it also becomes noteworthy that Influenza doesn't make an appearance in this Great War drama. Regardless, pity the picture flops after the red herring is exposed, and by that I mean it turns into just about every other superhero movie instead of the exceptional one it was potentially working towards being. Just more bloodless action, loads of explosions and CGI light blasts as the supes have conversations with as much as a mile distance between them (something that was amusingly mocked in DC's own ""Shazam!"" (2019)).Especially since having seen ""Professor Marston and the Wonder Women"" (2017), it's also hard not to be distracted by the general lack of sex in most of these PG-13 superhero flicks (""Batman Returns"" (1992) excepted). Basically, Wonder Woman began in the comics as bondage-and-discipline, dominance-and-submission sexual figure. That's still quite obvious what with the sexy-warrior-goddess outfit and Lasso of Truth hugging others into compliance. Nevertheless, we have an island of Amazons with hardly any indication of sapphic sex while we're given more unconsummated heterosexual ""love"" in the outside world. But, yeah, other than that, it's a relatively-good comic-book adaptation and one that was sorely needed at a time when about the only cinematic female superhero entries had been rubbish such as ""Supergirl"" (1984), ""Elektra"" (2005) and, yes, ""Catwoman."" Now, we're getting a Wonder Woman sequel, there's been a Captain Marvel movie, a Harley Quinn one, will be a Black Widow installment, in addition to the Avengers since expanding to include more than her as their sole female representative. Now if only we can get a great one.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Forced into the world by her idealism and her desire to help those in need she joins up with Chris Pine who plays the role of Steve Trevor with the same gusto as he plays Captain Kirk in Star Trek.This is a great origin story for Wonder Woman and it seems a lot more detailed and involved than Man of Steel did for Superman. Patty Jenkins has shown herself to be the right choice as a director of this movie - I personally can't help but wonder ( no pun intended ) if it's because this script was ""rumored to be"" locked almost a year before so no rewrites, no major changes etc - exactly the things the other DC movies are fighting with.The words of Morgan Freemans character in Shawshank Redemption describes my feelings for this movie:I find I'm so excited that I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head.

This is an average comic superhero movie where we see the roots of Wonder Woman, with it's perfect start, how-awful-things-are-when-a-superhero-tries-to-be-a-human moments and everything else. What makes it branch off and become something different - and better - is that we don't have a confident, know it all hero, more like a woman in the making, not mature but sure about her purpose and full of courage to do so.One thing though, the special effects in this movie look really low budget and you may be surprised when you see them for the first time. This movie is a lot more than the action scenes, and you shouldn't really focus just on them, but I'm surprised to see they didn't go for a more impressive look. Also Wonder Woman goes from having zero knowledge of her abilities to be this super confident hero that looks like it's been saving the world for years. That progression should've been done better I think.Something that makes this movie shine is how pure Wonder Woman is, and how everything around her shines. Her character is so honest and caring, follows her emotions and fights for her believes until the end. It's so good that she didn't ended up being this badass or funny type of superheroes we all know already, but still kept more than enough strength to not be a damsel in distress.Wonder Woman is a good movie that could've been so much better, but has some things so nicely done that it's worth the watch.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Then came Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which was just as good as the first one. Then came Wonder Woman. Not only this movie single handledly saved the DCEU from being extinct, it is also a game changer for super hero movies in general. Featuring Gal Gadot, known mostly for her role in the Furious movies, as well as Chris Pine, Robin Wright, and Connie Nielsen, and directed by the woman who directed the Academy Award winning Monster back in 2003, this film has become the most successful film made by a woman of all time globally and domestically. Despite its length, it moves at a smooth pace and never lets go. The special effects are amazing, the sound mix awesome, and the cinematography and acting top notch. In a summer where every movie is a reboot or a sequel, Wonder Woman is a fresh breath of air from the everyday worries of the real world. Go see it once, maybe even twice!!!","12 out of 26 found this helpful.

To my surprise, it didn't get steamrolled like with the previous DC movies. In fact, many critics really enjoyed this film. In spite of this, I wasn't really excited about seeing this movie. However, I decided that I want to see all the DCEU movies in theaters, so I went to see it.As far as story is concerned, it didn't impress me as much as I'd like it to. Now I do like the action sequences, those were the best parts the film has to offer. It really adds to the serious tone that the film is going for. I should bring up that there was one action sequence that really gave this film a triumphant feel to it. That Wonder Woman is now Wonder Woman. Charging through battle and just steamrolling through an army. I also want to mention that the final battle is also interesting as well. I won't say what happens, but it's a visual astonishment and concludes the story fairly well. The film also had moments that had me laughing at times. A few of the characters are pretty good with my favorites being the side characters that tag along with the 2 main characters. The villains are also alright.However, my issues with the film is that the first couple of minutes in the Amazon island were tedious. Throughout that time, I was just bored, I was slowly drinking my slushy, and when I finished the slushy, I was actually tempted to fall asleep. Even out of the Amazon Island and into London, there are moments that just feel awkward. I felt like covering my faces, my ears, or both. The character drama honestly rubs me the wrong way. Character drama is a very hard thing to pull off, but most of the character dramas that ends up happening makes me care less for these characters. One of them in particular actually made me care less for Wonder Woman herself. The amazon characters are forgettable, the queen was overly generic and stale. The plot twist at the end felt very underwhelming. I didn't see it coming since I usually tend to guess incorrectly, but the way it was revealed just made me feel like it could have been better.Overall, it's a film that has been consistently average, and one that I would never watch again. It has it's flaws and it has it's moments. I'm not willing to say it's a great movie, but not a stain to DC's record.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

She tells us a little about her past and her mixed views on mankind. She's working at her desk when representatives from Wayne Enterprises come into her office. They come offering gifts however and Diana accepts the briefcase they give her. Inside is the original photograph of her and her compatriots: Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), Sameer (Said Tagmhaoui), Charlie (Ewen Brenner) and The Chief (Eugene Brave Rock). They fought together in war-torn Belgium during the First World War. With the photo comes a note from Bruce saying that someday Diana has to tell Bruce her story. The photo is precious to Diana and she begins to fill us in on what happened to her so long ago.When I was watching Batman v Superman and the same photo appeared with Diana in that World War 1 setting, my first thought was ""I want to see that movie instead."" Part of that was the WW1 setting and I'm so glad they chose to set Wonder Woman in this time period. It provides a unique backdrop and there were so many interesting moments like Wonder Woman's fight across No Man's Land. WW1 is rarely covered in Hollywood and they make connections to real WW1 issues like the introduction of gas attacks into warfare. I thought it was impressive that they capitalized on such a strong concept, I have to credit the writers and director Patty Jenkins for doing such an excellent job.It wasn't that long ago that Warner Bros. and DC were hearing tons of complaints about Gal Gadot being cast as Wonder Woman. Admittedly, she's not known for being a serious actress but I really think she did an impressive job. She's strong yet vulnerable and she completely holds up her end as Diana from both dramatic and action oriented standpoints. They made a good call casting somebody of Pine's calibre beside her. He has a cool character to work with but he also balances his character's responsibilities as a spy and a guide to Diana for this new world she's experiencing. Danny Huston and Elena Anaya are both good but they're undercut by their characters in the end. I really liked the other members of Diana's crew even if they're not as central to the plot as they make them seen. I especially thought Said did a good job, he helps sell some of the nuanced emotional moments. Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen are also really good, the stuff with Diana's past could have been hokey but they handle it so well that it actually works.Wonder Woman includes everything you want in the superhero genre. The action is well shot, it's not necessarily anything mind-blowing but there are a few nice set pieces. It joins Deadpool and Captain America: The First Avenger in being one of the few superhero movies where they have a romantic subplot that actually sells. There are also some funny moments, most of them at Diana's expense of not knowing what the world was like in the 1910s. Lucy Davis is largely there as comedic relief as Etta and she does a decent job helping keep things light.For all the glowing reviews Wonder Woman, its not perfect. They do a great job setting up the villains and they even throw a curve ball at the end. But I didn't think they were very memorable and you're not going to remember Wonder Woman for their characters. They also gouge a few of the background villains pretty badly to lend some credibility to the main villain which wasn't my favourite choice. The ending wasn't poorly done but it devolves into the same fight we've seen in a dozen other superhero movies. I get we need a big finish but the rest of the movie deserved a better finale.I've been a little more forgiving of some of DCs franchises so far (I thought Man of Steel and Suicide Squad had their redeeming parts) but this is easily DCs best movie since Christopher Nolan was in control of Batman. They take advantage of an underused setting, Wonder Woman is a great protagonist and the cast (specifically Gal Gadot and Chris Pine) deliver strong performances. The movie isn't flawless however and I think the hype train has gotten a little out of control. It actually falls victim to some pretty typical minor issues for the genre. We should celebrate the fact that DC gave us a well-made and satisfying origin for Wonder Woman, if you have a chance to go see it, I would recommend it.","13 out of 29 found this helpful.

I was so severely disappointed with Batman v Superman except the Wonder Woman part. So I was a bit worried but this is a runaway hit. Gal Gadot commands the title character and thank god because I know there were people who were surprised at her casting. The director allowed her to be the heroine and not just as another capable woman being rescued by some guy. She comes off as powerful. The movie is exciting. The pace is great. I was also worried that it would feel dated like the first Captain America being as the setting was during WW1. But it felt fresh while holding onto the WW1 setting. The movie focuses on Gal Gadot and never distracts with side characters like the previous movie this character was in (Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice). In the end, you didn't want it to end and that is about as high a praise you can say about a movie. I wanted more. If I was going to rate it among the DC movie, its a very very close second to The Dark Knight, because the Dark Knight had a great villain. But no one has a better hero of all the DC movies than this one.","13 out of 29 found this helpful.

This is true of the film's director Patty Jenkins and the lead actor Gal Gadot, two female bad-asses who showed DC in specific and Hollywood in general how a fresh superhero movie is done.Wonder Woman fumigates some of the conventional superhero movies tropes and refreshingly tries something old-school, it has a simple origin story, and it brings in a female perspective on the genre by upping the emotional aspects and cuts down on the acidulous elements. As someone who is new to the character, I don't know the principles this superhero stood for. Diana was written and portrayed as a woman who is innocent, hopeful, caring, empathetic, uncompromisingly good, optimistic, and fierce on the battlefield and most of all she is what an ideal superhero should be: inspiring. Gal Gadot was perfectly cast for this role. Diana thinks that it's her duty to save humanity despite the cautions by her highly protective mother who shields her from ever coming in contact with humanity up to a certain point. But Diana is a destiny's child and she has to leave the Amazonian land eventually in search of her purpose in life.I was unimpressed by Gal Gadot in BvS, probably because Ben Affleck stole the show in that film. But now that she got her first standalone movie as the Wonder Woman I am thoroughly impressed by her. She is stunning in the Wonder Woman bustier and skirt but beyond that, she has this infectious charm about her; be it her smile, accent, screen presence, she is a treat to watch. She's agile in the fight sequences, she does it so naturally and with emotion, I was thoroughly impressed by that. (On a side note, Robin Wright and Connie Nielson look very fit for their age; believe it or not, they're both pushing 50s now. These women sure have some fine genes.)Chris Pine as Steve plays a foil to her, while she is naive in her approach towards humanity he is more street smart yet as dutiful as Diana and knows what Diana doesn't know, that humanity is flawed and may not be worthy of her compassion. As usual, Chris plays this charming guy who has a way of impressing with his words. He has impeccable comic timing, the pauses, and his facial expressions add to his enamoring presence. The chemistry Chris shares with Gal in this film is scintillating. It's one of the main reasons why this film works. You tend to root for them. I don't remember the last time I've hoped a couple hooked up in a superhero movie before. It felt organic and real. In that way, this is a superhero-romance movie. There are many elements of romance in this film which are not present in many (any?) superhero movie to date.Patty Jenkins knows how to pace her movie. This film never felt rushed or too slow, the pacing was just right. The story was simple and it gave her ample time to build the characters the way she wanted. This lady can shoot amazing action sequences. The first confrontation of the movie between the Germans and the Amazonians was a blast but arguably the standout action sequence was when Diana jumps into the front line and takes on a barrage of bullets head on, in order to defend innocent people because she feels it's her duty to protect those who cannot protect themselves. It was somehow liberating to watch her find purpose in finally doing what she trained all her life for. The action choreography is stellar and there's a grace to it.The reason why this film diverges so much from the other movies in DCU though is not that of the action sequence but because it gets some of the subtle character moments dabbled sporadically, making Diana believable. There's the hilarious conversation between Steve and Diana about human reproduction, Diana trying out her clothes in London, Steve telling Diana that maybe humanity is not exactly what she thought it would be, and my favorite of these sequences comes just before she enters the war zone when Steve treats her to an ice- cream and she relishes it like a child and appreciates the ice-cream vendor saying he should be proud of himself. Even in the middle of the war sequence, she's mindful of her friends and checks to see if they are alright. These are important emotions to make a character believable. Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad were so pompous and larger than life that they forgot what superheroes stand for; the people who pit their hopes in them.The final fight is not as impressive as the rest of the film but still, there are a couple of character moments that I think ground the scene. At 2 hours 20 minutes this film may be long but it doesn't ""feel"" long due to the appropriate pacing. Maybe you may start feeling a bit of the length bearing down on you during the climactic fight.The dialogues and the background music need to be mentioned specifically for elevating some of the sequences in this film. We do get to hear the iconic theme music but only after almost 70 minutes into the film and as it's her first decisive fight against people who are actually trying to kill her. I think this is the second superhero film this year after Logan where the conversations flow naturally. This film had THE best dialogues in the DCU so far.","10 out of 21 found this helpful.

Wonder Woman in this movie embodies that.At the beginning of the movie I was worried. The way the action was cut was strange, they had unnecessary slow motion, the dialogue was a bit off and the story seemed like it was going to fall into a clich√© route.Yet, as the movie continued, the themes of nobility, honor and sacrifice came into fruition and it became a battle of morals. When she first runs into the battle field, it's an awesome moment to watch, but they had been building up the idea that honor is fighting your own battle to protect others without hesitation and it lands.At the end, you learn who the villain is and this has definitely gotten the most flack. However, this stuck with me best because Wonder Woman assumes her duty to save men from an ""indestructible"" threat. Meanwhile, they make their own personal sacrifices, validating the journey, filled with slow, thoughtful moments, to get there.This left me inspired because of how well the creators realized the symbolic significance of the characters, both Wonder Woman and her fitting companion Steve Trevor.","14 out of 32 found this helpful.

The best part is all those people who read the comics or watched JL animated series and Wonder Woman animated movie got a very different ending. There was so less content on which we were able to say ""Ah!! This is same as the animated movie!!!"". Action sequences with great camera movement made it visually appealing. Support character like Steve Trevor made an exceptional job without stealing the limelight from Diana (actual central character). The movie was so fresh and had a satisfying conclusion. Looking forward to JL movie coming this winter. Great Movie and a must watch.","14 out of 32 found this helpful.

While we enjoyed most of the WW movie, it is irksome to see Hollywood screwing with the feature to make their liberal points. Point one: Does every movie have to feature a naked man? Is this on the Gay agenda, or -- due to the director being female -- is she a pervert? Yes, we see that all of the teenage boys and beer-drinking crowd laugh at the scene, it seems most embarrassing to the actor and those of us who still have a shred of decency. Point two: The Native American Indian blames the white man for the loss of his country. The Onondaga Nation, a part of the Iroquois Confederacy, unilaterally declared war on Germany, citing ill-treatment of tribal members who were stranded in Berlin at the beginning of hostilities. The Oneida Nation, another member of the Iroquois Confederacy, also declared war on Germany. Over ten thousand Native Americans went to war to help America save the world. When WWII came along, the Native Americans joined by the ten's of thousands to help save the rest of the world a second time. What a great line it would have been if the Native American said something like: America is my country too!","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

It wonderfully awakes gender and racial diversity!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3717881/?ref_=tt_urv","ayang-97272","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur68316308/?ref_=tt_urv","28 May 2017","Wonder Woman is a film that means to improve society and bring Hope to diversity! It awakes audiences to realizing both gender inequality and racial inequality under- representation such as handsome-Chinese men with our white actresses are long overdue romantic plots. There are so much territory to explore and to improve and to not hinder our domestic actresses and actors' diversity development. The bell strikes for more diversity and it is great!It is really interesting to see this movie and then hear how some say the same lines, and repeating that it somehow copies Captain America 1 and tries to say it's worse by relating it to Thor 2. Take that by a grain of salt as it is not too hard to make multiple similar reviews. I think from the standout performance of Wonder Woman from Batman V Superman, it showed how good her solo film could be. It certainly was proved in this film. There will certainly be moments where the gender dominance be challenged but only by those super edgy, and to be a real man requires the humbleness to accept balance, and respect the others. I am excited about this film, I hope it get's fair reviews and critical opinions, not ones that are just cheerleaders to the Marvel universe and secretly hoping it doesn't get competitors. Who knows how much money is spent by a studio to sway the initial reviews. Movies reviews should be just about the movies. This film looks good! I care fairness of the reviews equally. To be fair, Thor 2 was okay, similar to Man of Steel, and Wonder Woman has a heart on top the action. Regarding feminism and patriarchal system, each should respect the other without either overcompensating and off-setting the balance. The phase Hollywood have to and needs to improve on, is getting handsome Chinese man a powerful lead protagonist in a movie to suitably make Hollywood unbiased diverse. It is unfortunate that there are probably many studios fearing to give hot Chinese man a central character and integrating them into the supposedly diverse interracial circle of Hollywood. It is surprising that Hollywood is not willing to media any sort of romantic drama between Chinese man and our competent white female actresses. It is an insult to us, and to the large white female actresses population, to be barred from further developing culturally and professionally with diversity. After all we're all humans. Wonder Woman is a good long over- due slate to mitigating the big internal cultural barrier established for poor nefarious reasons by studios own by Hollywood and connected to politics. Let Wonder Woman bring hope to this issue. The film has a great sense of Hope endowed in it.","34 out of 91 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Continuing DCEU's more serious and philosophical examination of superheroes","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3739245/?ref_=tt_urv","xamtaro","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19392148/?ref_=tt_urv","26 June 2017","The origin story of the quintessential female superhero is finally realised on the big screen. Only the fourth entry into the DC Extended Universe (DCEU), WONDER WOMAN is an feature length flashback detailing the events behind the mysterious photo from the First World War that was shown in 2016's BATMAN V SUPERMAN. Before she became a hero, Diana of the Amazons had only known a paradise of sisters forged in the ideals of cooperation and a Mission to defend the world against Ares, the last of the old Greek gods. Her perfect world is shattered when war comes to Paradise Island in the form of the American spy Steve Trevor and a ship full of German enemy pursuers. Diana in her innocent idealism believes Ares to be responsible for the war and leaves the island with Trevor in the hope that killing Ares will spare innocent lives from the horrors of war.Giving life to the character of Diana is actress Gal Gadot. Gal is a dead ringer for the iconic superhero, looking exactly like she stepped out of the comic books. The earnestness she brings to the role perfectly conveys Diana's innocence and idealistic outlook. Much time is spent focused on the characters such that even side characters receive decent characterisation and development. Diana shares a magnificent chemistry with co-star Chris Pine playing the world weary captain Steve Trevor. Their romantic sub plot can be compared to classic romances like Casablanca, masterfully and tastefully realised on screen. But the more intriguing aspect is when the movie goes into their minds, showing their contrasting perspectives on life.Diana approaches her Mission like a child approaching a fairy tale story. Clear black and white morality, destroy the bad guy and the world is saved. That simple. Unfortunately, it is not that simple and her entire story is one of growing up and seeing the truth about humanity's ugly nature. On the flip side, Trevor straddles the line of cynicism; he knows full well the worst that humanity is capable of yet cannot bring himself to break Diana's innocent worldview.What begins as a relatively run of the mill superhero origin story morphs into a surprisingly deep narrative that seeks to shatter viewer expectations. True to the DCEU, WONDER WOMAN, like its predecessors, explores some heady themes against the backdrop of war. Key of which is weighing Diana's idealism against worldly cynicism and outright nihilism. The movie explores those perspectives through its characters, never preaching one over the other and coming to a mature conclusion that ties into an ongoing theme of ""hero by choice, not by obligation"" that the DCEU movies had been conveying.The movie never shies away from showing the true horrors of combat, broken families, broken people, a hero helpless against the odds, a truly dark time serving as a stark contrast to the amazon's paradise island. Into this darkness comes Diana herself who is given ample opportunity to flex her powers in a spectacular show of Super heroics. Patty Jenkins approaches the action like a pro, keeping to the more fantastic, speed ramped portrayal of superhero fighting as established by Zack Snyder, while adding her own touches such as the amazons' uniquely cooperative battle tactics (which gets a wonderful payoff later in the movie). Her masterful direction extends to the balanced tone of the movie. Many comic book movies prefer to stuff their narrative with humour, even in the middle of intense battle scenes, such that the movie fails to take itself seriously. WONDER WOMAN does not fall into that trap. The battles are approached with respectful gravitas, and a genuine sense of peril. Bookending such sequences are character centred scenes in a peaceful setting which help to develop their relationships in a very natural and heartfelt way. There is humour and it is used sparingly, never detracting from the underlying themes or the seriousness of the setting.This balance gives us a product that can easily appeal to everyone. Diana as a character is one that anyone who had ever been a child can relate to. The epic action, consistently focused on the characters and set to an emotionally rousing score by Rupert Gregson Williams (Legend of Tarzan), will please the typical blockbuster fan. For those who love the deeper more thematically complex cinematic offerings, you will not be disappointed by the themes explored in this move. And as a refreshing surprise, WONDER WOMAN features what I can unabashedly say is the most genuine and well written romance in a comic book movie, ever.Truly wonderful.","6 out of 11 found this helpful.

I liked a woman superhero, the diversity in the movie, and the character of the God of War, and how he debated the nature of humanity with Wonder Woman towards the end. On the other hand, it was too long, had some corny parts that should have been cut, and was kind of standard action hero fare, which are getting so common these days. There was this really touching scene of her dancing in the snow at night with the spy, and then I thought Director Patty Jenkins spoiled it by not just leaving it as it was, and instead showed them going upstairs to make love. I just thought that was clich√© and unnecessary, just like the double entendres when he's standing there naked with his watch (""you mean you let that little thing tell you what to do?""). I also thought it was ironic that this version of Wonder Woman is hailed as the non-objectified version, when she's wearing a skimpy skirt, still has big breasts on full display, and is always perfectly made up. It's hit and miss, and I would also note, not appropriate for little kids, much as we may want to show them a female superhero.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Some scenes are fantastic and some scenes just look out of place but they are not too obvious, just noticeable in most cases. After leaving the cinema the movie will left you with a good and beautiful memories I can't even explain it in the first place and must take time to analyze the symbols and meanings of some specific spectacular scenes for awhile. I can say without any doubt that Wonder Woman is the game-changer movie of the Detective Comics Extended Universe by Warner Bros. Pictures. Men will love it, Women will love it, the elders and kids will love it. All that been said are the factors that made Patty Jenkins my another most favorite visionary director on the list!All in all, If you love superhero movies- Wonder Woman will not disappoint you.

This resulted in bright images, especially the war scenes, projected by dual projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, completely using the whole screen without chopping the picture. The images are larger than life, but they don't confuse the eye or strain the vision of the audience. Along with 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that was used very well for the sound editing! :)Wonder Woman is just another superhero action flick, without explaining why she was the chosen one, giving further evidence that Jews controlling the world, from the Academy Awards to Pixar. I feel that its the movie most people should enjoy, especially the mass production who have been disappointed by DC movies over the past couple of years.

I became a fan of Wonder Woman when I watched the Lynda Cater version on TV as a kid. Wonder Woman sure has come a long way. I just love the costume they made for her, it's militaristic yet still feminine. And Gal Gadot rocks in the role, she's hot (for one thing!) and projects a lot of strength and courage. There is non-stop excitement in this film! The action scenes are amazing, but I'm glad they found time to squeeze in some character building in between the awesome fights scenes. I like how Wonder Woman is like a fish out of water when she first arrives in industrialized 1918 London. I found it interesting that they set the story during World War I instead of World War II. Though I wish they explained how on Earth can the Amazons speak English when they have cloistered themselves in Themiscyra for thousands of years and English did not even exist before they took refuge on the island.

Rather than being set in the future it is firmly in the past. The Wonder Women is Diana who is played by Gal Gadot. There is a real on screen chemistry with pilot Steve Trevor (played by Chris Pine) and the plot builds nicely. You care what happens to the characters in the movie and this helps to make the action sequences thrilling. A lot has been made by the lead role being female, but it is just a good action movie.

There were also many more logical problems in this movie, that made it difficult to get into it. But, I enjoyed the mystic stories in the movie: Like the classic stories, they describes our feelings with legends and gods. So there was hope for the movie, but it was clear, this movie cant be great. Later on I discovered another beautiful element, the critics on our civilization full of lies, hatred, selfishness, loss of empathy to each other, hide our lovely feelings was hard for me, because it touches a truth, that my psyche remembers me every day: It wants to leave this artificial world and return to the natural life, I have already had in my life. Some parts of the movie gave me another motivation to sell everything and move to another country, where people have time to each other, both sexes are loving each other instead of fighting. Gal, the actress of WW is just beautiful, but she failed in the action parts of the movie. In addition the CGI effects were only average. The background music very clich√©d.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

While not on the same level as the Dark Knight trilogy, this film is a solid and entertaining superhero movie that is much better than ""Batman v. Superman"" and ""Suicide Squad."" The film's plot is generally easy to follow and has some very visually ambitious set pieces, from the Greek island where Wonder Woman is from to a well-choreographed and fairly visceral depiction of trench warfare in World War I. Gal Gadot gives a good performance as Wonder Woman. The supporting cast is a bit less commanding, but still generally well-casted. The villains in the film are genuinely evil and are woven into the plot very well, but they are not particularly developed as characters by the script.It wouldn't be a superhero film without action scenes, and the ones in ""Wonder Woman"" deliver. While they do not necessarily deviate from the overtly noisy, fairly neo-noir tone of action scenes in other DC Comics films, they are thrilling and fully engaging. Despite a fairly long running time of 141 minutes, the film's pacing is brisk and excellent. That said, there are some flaws to ""Wonder Woman."" The main criticism I have of the film pertains to the big finale, which unfortunately becomes fairly anti-climatic and begins to lose focus as it unravels. Additionally, the film seems to use a bit too much CGI at some points that some of its visual effects start to look a bit hokey. At the end of the day, ""Wonder Woman"" is an entertaining comic book film that should satisfy those looking for an action-packed time at the movies. Recommended. 7/10 Note: I saw the film in IMAX 3D. While I would not say it is necessary, this film was worth the extra charge to see in that format. The film's visual effects and action scenes were enhanced by the larger screen and more powerful sound system and bass. The 3D was worthwhile as well, containing some 'in-your-face' effects (flying bullets, lighting, etc.) while also providing depth in other scenes.","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

First of all I congratulate Patty Jenkins for choosing Gal Gadot for the role of wonder woman on the movie, She done a good job on her career and she performed very well through her acting ability, action sequences, dialogues everything and she nailed the character of Wonder Woman in the movie. All the characters done well. Including Connie Nielson, Elena Anaya, Danny Huston, Sa√Ød Taghmaoui etc..Another plus point is BGM and Soundtrack mesmerizing every way and I thank to Hans Zimmer and Rupert Gregson Williams for such a beautiful feel. Hans Zimmer is the man behind the Wonder Woman theme music it's a perfect theme for the movie. I forgot 2 names Chris Pine you are stunning and one of the best character got on your career. Another person is Robin Wright I didn't see her fighting sequences till date she is fantastic, her fighting sequences in the movie very much surprised me she is superb at this age.All in all it's a must watch movie and perfect movie for all the audiences.

A photograph from WW1 sparks memories of her childhood, the daughter of the Queen of the Amazons, growing up and meeting, in WW1, Steve Trevor, an American spy. He will give her life purpose, cause her to leave the shelter of her home island and help her integrate into society. Most importantly, he will help her find and confront the arch-enemy of the Amazons - Ares, the God of War.Better than most comic-book movies (not that this says much). Good set up and decent plot development, combined with an attention- grabbing appearance from Gal Gadot (and I'm not referring to her acting). Initially manages to not overdo the usual fantasy / sci fi bs, giving you hope that this might not degenerate into the usual special effects-driven nonsense that makes comic-book movies so empty and predictable.However, this was too good to last. From a point it is all about the CGI-driven action scenes, complete with fantasy gobbledygook and improbable, out-of-the-blue outcomes. So it ends pretty much as your standard comic book movie.Overall, okay and worth watching, but not a must-see.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

I say this because sometimes a setting gives an enhanced mood, and that may be why I've given this film a score of 10, instead of 9. By the way, I live in London UK and have been to all the best cinemas in the UK, and none of them come even close to the atmosphere and outrageous comfort of the cinema I was in. OK, thats an explanation of the ambiance. Now onto the film itself. Gal Gadot was pretty perfect as Wonder Woman. Though other actresses could have played the role, I think this was a perfect vehicle for her. Her look is gorgeous, and I don't just mean facially, but also in the way that she carries herself in the film. She appears regal, inquisitive, caring, knowledgeable tough, tender and also resolute. She pulls all this off extremely successfully. All the other character portrayals were okay, but the quality of Gal Gadot's acting did Shine through. It wasn't sophisticated, but just pitched just right. The action at times was excellent, and at other times, I felt could have used a bit more oomph. But happily, there was more to this film than just action. Each new character that was introduced was given their own little back story, so one could feel more engaged with them. I found this an important reason for the success of this film. Marvel films do not invest in the emotional history of characters, just an action history, if I may call it that. There were moments of real tenderness in the film. Remarkable to see innocence so effectively played in an adult context. There is a time in the film that Wonder Woman disagrees with a decision that was made, and it made her angry. But even in this you can see how emotionally torn she is about going against her her comrades, even though she'd been proved right. This film was amazing, and I will see it again in the cinema. The director knocked this out of the park. And I'm glad a female director has shown that it's not only Joss Whedon and JJ Abrams that can pull this sort of action off this well. Excellent.","12 out of 27 found this helpful.

Because those same people will see that theses movies were awesome just as Waterworld back in the days, but critics have a job to do and it's to call film flop and other good...Here, Wonder Woman possibly the best superhero film (in any company) since Man of Steel tell you a story, an awesome story to follow with a great lead. Gal Gadot. An Actress/Model people did not have lot of faith in... but I had lot of faith. She was awesome and believable in her role in the Fast and Furious franchise and she can do a lot better. That'S what she prove here. I won't tell any spoiler but it's a perfect film. The main villain is really believeble and the CGI does look good. The effects are awesome.

Enough said on that.I was hoping this would be a 10 star review but alas, the movie has what I consider flaws and unfortunately they are glaring to me.Wonder Woman with Gal Gadot does have it all..action,plot,cinematography and great acting. But there is too much emphasis on the war(think the latest Godzilla movie) and Diana doesn't strut her superhero stuff until over half way through the movie.I never read the comics so maybe it is accurate..the war..and the *eyeroll* romance. But Gadot and Pine lacked strong chemistry.I loved the over the top action when WonderWoman finally takes off....but yes the CGI was at times disappointing..I'd fire whoever was in charge of it.This was too important a movie for such mistakes. Overall,I give it 7 stars , I'd watch it again but it wasn't what I was hoping for.I REALLY hope the sequel learns from the mistakes in this movie.Gal Godot definitely IS Wonder Woman..no doubt in my mind.But i expect more next time.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

And did it ever meet them! I love the fact that the entire movie never felt that it had to rush to tell the story. It built upon it's own foundation and took you to Diana's world and let you dwell there. Then it seemed every stage of the story effectively ran it's course on cue, not lingering too long and not jumping from scene to scene in whiplash fashion. It did well building emotion and keeping it gritty when necessary. What I was surprised about was it wasn't just for the girls. Steve Trevor wasn't there for eye candy, he did his part and pulled his weight. Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and hope has been restored into the WB's DC franchise. Kudos Wonder Woman. Thank you for bringing the girls into the game.","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

It would be wonderful to see a world war II movie that shows more nuance than the good guy bad guy narrative that's always told in America. I think we're all ready to be presented with complexity.

My initial worries mostly related to the dour seriousness of previous DC films (even Suicide Squad was bleak and depressing), and the visual tone seemed to suggest Wonder Woman was going to follow suit.Thankfully, Patty Jenkins proves my reservations were unwarranted. Wonder Woman is an exciting, clever, and humorous introduction to the character, one of the best origin stories we've ever been gifted. After an admittedly rocky start (with some pretty terrible CGI), Jenkins turns this into a superbly assured film. Gal Gadot more than adequately steps into the boots of Lynda Carter -- she makes this Diana Prince her own, reminding me in ways of Christopher Reeve as Superman. She's awkward and gawky as she tries to blend in with the rest of human civilization. In one of the movie's more memorable scenes, Diana tries on clothes, wondering how anyone is supposed to fight in such restrictive ""armor"".Chris Pine has proved his leading man status several times over, but his chemistry with Gadot is instant and charming. His secretary Etta Candy is played by scene-stealing Lucy Davis, who befriends the Amazonian princess quickly, admiring her strength and refusal to placate the male-dominated culture. Robin Wright makes an excellent and strong impression as Diana's personal trainer. However, Gal Gadot is truly what makes Wonder Woman the success it is. This is her chance to prove her star-making turn in the otherwise woeful ""Batman v Superman"" was not a fluke, and she delivers in spades. Director Patty Jenkins handles all of this with an assured hand, making the action scenes fluid and comprehensible without resorting to flashy or distracting editing. I normally despise transitions from fast-to-slow motion, but Jenkins gets this right too: there's just enough to see Wonder Woman's super-human feats without falling victim to the Zack Snyder effect of removing all excitement from the scene. Not just one of the best superhero movies out of the DC universe, this is one of the best superhero movies period.","9 out of 19 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Review ‚Äì Wonder Woman (2017) .. Patty Jenkins / Gal Gadot film is a winner all the way! [+78%]","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3724461/?ref_=tt_urv","arungeorge13","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur30872044/?ref_=tt_urv","5 June 2017","If you are someone who'd been awaiting that one DCEU film which was going to undo all the shambles we'd seen from Warner Bros. post Nolan's Batman trilogy, look no further. This Gal Gadot standalone film delivers the goods, and in style. The central characters are well fleshed-out and their motives distinct (except, as usual, the anti-climactic villain!); there are a couple of amazingly executed set-pieces, the message on the (futile) essence of war delivered loud and clear; ultimately, the film is what one would call a game- changer for the DCEU.As a viewer who constantly keeps track of the MCU and DCEU, shades of 'Thor' and 'Captain America: The First Avenger' were felt throughout. The story starts off at Themyscira, the home of the Amazon warriors, the landscape of which is pure eye-candy. Laden with lush green pastures and serene beaches, the kingdom is indeed a thing of beauty. Diana's origin story is partially established, she learns of the battle of the Gods and acquires martial skills as she makes steady progress in becoming a young warrior-princess herself.The going gets dark once Pine's character (Capt. Steve Trevor) inevitably enters the scene. Determined to stop Ares (the God of War) who has presumably taken the form of German general Ludendorff, Diana agrees to assist Steve in his pursuit to end the war of all wars (WW I). The conversational exchanges between Diana and Steve are laced with enough humor and flamboyance for even the average viewer to let out a chuckle or two, lightening the tone to an extent all the while trying to remain consistent with the darker, more relevant theme of the film.Predominantly a writer for television, scenarist Allan Heinberg does a marvellous job tying in the two universes with ease. Diana's coming-of-age (from a warrior princess to a Goddess in its truest sense!) is presented in an engaging yet insightful manner (based on a story by Snyder and Fuchs). Patty Jenkins (who helmed Charlize Theron's 'Monster') interestingly had to be the redeemer of the DCEU after BvS and Suicide Squad hit rock-bottom in terms of feedback, and she achieves what even the likes of Zack Snyder and David Ayer could not. She treats the material in hand with all earnestness, imparting the right amount of panache and cheer, as and when required (Snyder's stylistic touches are felt throughout, but added in right measure!).And Gadot..the word is WOW. She's got ravishing looks, the physique of a warrior and brings to the forefront, the kind of innocent charm and confidence a superhero(ine) of her other-worldly universe is expected to exude. Her performance is indeed the film's strong- point. Pine does a neat job playing the role of her human-foil. The antagonist character though, is slightly underwritten (there's a twist that doesn't quite hit the mark!). The opening set-piece at the beach in Themyscira and the one that takes place at No-Man's- Land are exquisitely crafted. (P.S ‚Äì I got goosebumps every time Hans Zimmer/Junkie XL's WW theme started playing during set- pieces!). Rupert-Gregson Williams' (Hacksaw Ridge, The Legend of Tarzan) compositions hold well for the constantly evolving Diana. Cinematographer Mathew Jensen (F4, Chronicle) smartly captures the enticing vistas of Amalfi Coast, Italy for the initial portions and employs appropriate color tones to denote the change-in-universe (a good portion of the film is shot in limited light!). Costume and Art departments have done remarkable work. Last but not the least, the visual effects (save for the climax sequence!) are splendid.They say a film that doesn't spoon-feed is more likely one that is bound to stay with the viewer for longer stretches. Wonder Woman, for sure, has set a benchmark for films in the DCEU and I sincerely wish 'Justice League' turns out to be a worthy follow-up. Kudos to Jenkins, Gadot and crew for hitting a home-run!","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A decent origin story that brings DC on the right track","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4115243/?ref_=tt_urv","aquascape","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3955578/?ref_=tt_urv","3 April 2018","""Wonder Woman"" was received with high praises from critics, complementing the presence of a female-centric superhero movie. While there certainly is ambition into making this film, the story that it evolves around is just another generic ""superhero fights a forgettable villain"". The film was also surrounded by social movements and my recommendation is to watch the movie from your own perspective and make your own judgement.The film centers on Diana Prince, known as Wonder Woman, and her initial training in becoming a fierce Amazon warrior. The daughter of Hippolyta lives on the island Themyscira, a secluded paradise inhabited by women. Their whole idyllic way of life is disrupted when American pilot Steve Trevor crashes on the island. We later find out from him that outside of the island, there is an ongoing war, The Great War, that is consuming mankind. The golden heart princess sets off into London together with the pilot to stop the threat and fulfill her true destiny. The film tries to hide the story's plainness with a villainous twist, but ultimately is turns out like any other film of the genre.Gal Gadot is the perfect representation of Wonder Woman and does terrific in the action sequences. Chris Pine performs great as pilot Steve Trevor adding a lot of comical effect to the movie. The scenes with Gadot and Pine are especially great, as they are lighthearted and delightful.The script has a lighter tone than regular movies from the DC universe and it can be seen that DC is trying to change their style to better accommodate the general audience.The film's score was very good, in particular the main theme song, it really made you believe you were in the midst of the Amazonian people. This is something that's been missing from recent superhero movies, not having a suitable theme, a theme that could be recognized anywhere. Rupert Gregson-Williams did an excellent job and I hope he will continue on this path moving forward.""Wonder Woman"" is one of DC's finest works soaring at the box-office, but in my opinion it doesn't stand up to the high praises its been given. In the end, it still felt like it missed the excitement of a well constructed superhero movie.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

"6","/10","It could have done with some trimming here and there, but there are some fun moments","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3849832/?ref_=tt_urv","jimbo-53-186511","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26154754/?ref_=tt_urv","4 November 2017","Diana (Gal Gadot)is living on a remote island paradise and has spent years training as an Amazonian warrior; all her training is so that she is prepared in case Ares (the god of war) returns to attack her and her people - the remote island was created by Zeus after he defeated Ares as a means of protecting them and also in order to make it difficult for Ares to find them. When a pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine)crashes into the sea close to the island, Diana rescues him and attempts to find out who he is and what he's doing there? It turns out that Steve is integral in bringing a major war to an end and Diana feels that it is her duty to help him...I'm a complete newbie to Wonder Woman so this film is literally my first experience of Wonder Woman and the end result for me was a film that was fairly satisfying, but one that contained some weaknesses...Every superhero origin film needs a backstory and Wonder Woman does indeed have a backstory, but in this film it does take up quite a large chunk of the film; is it superhero filmmaking lore now that a superhero film cannot run for less than 2 hours? To it's credit, I didn't feel particularly bored at any point, but it's safe to say that the film is better when Steve and Diana arrive in London so perhaps that's why the first half of the film suffers by comparison.Once Steve and Diana arrive in London then the film certainly becomes more enjoyable; there are plenty of fish-out-of-water jokes which are amusing and both Pine and Gabot have a nice easy-going chemistry which also helps to make the film enjoyable. The story is OK, but the light-hearted tone goes a long way and it's a film that you feel is constantly winking and nodding at its audience.Although the story is OK and just about has the legs to carry the film there are other elements to the film that are rather weak; the villains are underdeveloped, their plan/scheme isn't really given the focus that it deserves and some aspects of the plotting are absolutely ludicrous, but as I've said these weaker aspects are overshadowed by the overall sense of fun that is on offer here.There are no real standout performances here, but the main cast all muck in together and are all good in their own right. Lucy Davis was the only surprise here as she is barely recognisable in her respective role - in fact I think it was well over halfway into the film before I realised it was her (and I only recognised her on a close up shot).Wonder Woman is entertaining and enjoyable and for much of the second half of the film it does have its tongue in its cheek. However, an overlong backstory, underdeveloped villains and some absurd plotting hold it back slightly meaning that it isn't as great as it could have been. On balance though, it's a pretty fun ride and a relatively enjoyable piece of escapism.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Superheroes in the cinema are as common as they were in the childhood of many (30+) viewers. A mostly male scene, deserves a female counterpart. Those are Wonder Woman, Black Widow and more to come.But apart from being the hero we (or female fans) deserve, the superhero genre more than others, needs a story, more than a pretty face. Luckily, the director gave Wonder Woman more than just heroism, super strength and bravery. They chose for a hero who is conflicted with her own kind, but also with mankind, making her lonely in more than one aspect.The mistake however is also making her young and naive. Being young and naive could be the right choice if there was more time, or if it was through flashbacks. Being a hero is often a story about growing up, maturing, letting go and accepting responsibility. There are 2 red threads: the hero that doesn't choose his path but has to (Superman, Spiderman), and the hero that does choose his path and wants to (Batman, Captain America). But that has been done before, and too many times. As stated, Spider-Man, Captain America, etc.What sets Wonder Woman apart is her special heritage. The director could've chosen to focus on her childhood, her development, her mythology, but that's the part that was rushed. The director could've chosen to focus on her relation with other heroes, to make her a part of the bigger DC universe. But unfortunately she chose the familiar path of a hero that decides to go to the war (sounds familiar), gets confronted with something that's bigger than her, and finds a way to defeat it. With that path, the movie falls flat as it fails to set itself apart as different. The well timed comedy, the lessons about humanity and the good job by Gal Gadot couldn't save this from being standard.","0 out of 8 found this helpful.

DC Extended Universe, the first female led superhero film in over a decade (we can try to forget that Catwoman and Elektra happened....but they did) and also the first female director to direct a superhero film with a female protagonist (the second in comic book films behind Lexi Alexander for 2008's Punisher: War Zone). From these points, plus the fact that the films within the DCEU haven't received the critical claim that I'm sure the studio hoped to gain and what the fans hoped to achieve, there seemed to be a question of how much pressure is riding on Wonder Woman to be appease both the fans and the critics of the DCEU, let alone the number of people that have been waiting over seventy-five years for her to have her big screen outing. Wonder Woman is set before the other installments of the DCEU, taking place during World War I. One day just off the shores of Themyscira, an Allied intelligence officer, Steve Trevor, crashes his plane and warns the Amazons of the war to end all wars that is taking place outside of their bubble. Shocked to hear of the atrocities and casualties of the war, Diana decides to go with Trevor to the front of the war and fight for the helpless and discover her true destiny.I had relatively high expectations leading up to the release of this film due to how well I thought the trailers were done and I must say that the film even managed to surpass them. The film starts off strong introducing the audience to the island of Themyscira and the Amazon warriors that live on it, telling us the history behind their existence which on paper sounds completely ridiculous and yet with Patty Jenkins at the helm, that origin is fully embraced and isn't afraid to make a joke at its own expense to generate a laugh or two. Jenkins has made it clear that she was influenced by Richard Donner's Superman and when you're watching the film you can clearly see shades of that influence, from showing us the heroes homeland in the first act, to the superhero figure coming out as a beacon of hope in a grey world and the character gets to shine brightly within the World War I setting. Following Diana's journey to mankind's world and seeing her naivety about seeking out immediately to help those in need within a black and white viewpoint about right and wrong, whilst learning of the evil that men are capable of, actually feels refreshing in the landscape of comic book films we've had as of late. The films key strength and glue that keeps the audience invested is the relationship between Diana and Steve Trevor. Both of them fold into the 'fish out of water' mould that perfectly compliment each other as they are both bemused by the others origins as one has never seen a man before and the other has never met a....well, a God. Their journey throughout the film feels more authentic than forced and that's due to the terrific chemistry that they have together on screen. Steve is, in his words an 'above average' man that is more than capable of handling himself within the settings of the war but can't help but deliver some sharp sense of humour as he stares in awe when Diana begins to unleash her powers and I thought Chris Pine gave a really good performance in the role. Gal Gadot on the other hand.....I thought she was excellent as Diana. Much has questioned about her ability as an actress capable of playing the role since she was cast back in 2013, rather unfairly in my opinion. Here she manages to find the balance of bringing innocence, sincerity and badassery to the role and with the action sequences she has and the material that she has to work with, this is comfortably her best performance to date. From the supporting cast I thought Robin Wright's performance as General Antiope stood out the most for me, though I did also like Connie Nielsen, David Thewlis and Sa√Ød Taghmaoui. There's a few scenes that stood out to me, with the action sequence that will be referred to as No Man's Land I thought was perfectly done, from the buildup of the scene to the pacing of the sequence and the editing and then there's the small moments such as Steve teaching Diana how to dance or sway really well. Even within the positively, there's a few issues I have with the film that many comic book films fall victim to. The key one being the use of special effects. While it relies heavily on it in the final acts battle scene, it feels more justified than say how the CGI is handled on a battle scene on Themyscira where it is terribly noticeable to the point of distracting, to the rather poor use of green screen as two characters are having a conversation with one another. The other issue is that the films main villains, as in General Ludendorff and mad scientist Doctor Poison are just too flat and one-dimensional as we're giving nothing to develop even hatred towards them and one certain aspect of Lundendorff is never really addressed thinking back on the film that's actually bugging me. The performances from Danny Huston and Elena Anaya were rather 'too theatrical' at one point, involving one scene and a group of Germans. Wonder Woman is a wonderfully inspiring and compassionate superhero film that is a breath of fresh air in the genre thanks to Patty Jenkins at the helm. The action sequences are more often than not fantastic to watch and the performances from Gadot and Pine keep you invested. Her time is now indeed.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

It was almost too much!","12 out of 28 found this helpful.

However, the supporting characters had both little screen time and little impact on the movie. They were essentially left on for occasional comic relief and to fill in an open space. Their own identities are explored only very briefly and their abilities are never truly shown or used. Villains Sir Patrick, General Ludendorff and Dr. Maru had the same problem. We never got to understand their characters, never got into their mindset and It was disappointing at how little they were used. The Amazons are a partial exception. Although they were on-screen for a short period of time, they proved their worth similar to how Khan proved his in Star Trek Into Darkness. However, they ended up being swept away too soon anyway. Special effects were absolutely amazing and I don't think anyone could possibly complain about it. Costumes were fitting for a period piece and the uniforms of the Germans in the village and the troops in the trenches were particularly well-done with quite nice attention to detail. The plot is one of its pitfalls. Compared to Logan, released earlier in the year, Wonder Woman's plot just feels overused, drab and a bit of a flop. To be honest, it just wasn't written as well as I had hoped and just isn't up to the same standard of Logan in terms of plot. The storyline was a bit clich√©, with one character selflessly sacrificing himself, the main character using the death as motivation, blah, blah, blah. This has just been used too many times to hold the same entertainment value. It's humor in how Diana attempts to get in touch with the fashion standards of 1918 was dull and rather 'cringe' at best. Overall, it is very linear and predictable. It lacked enough character development to actually bring true emotion to all. Another point which I found irritating was it's overuse of very blatant symbolism. There are just too much symbolism to make the film have flow. Symbolism should be subtle but present. In Wonder Woman, it just feels forced. I do have to compliment whoever made the soundtrack. I'd say it's on par with the soundtrack of The Dark Knight. Overall, this movie would've benefited much from additional character development and use of supporting characters. Excellent performances, great effects, dramatic soundtrack, fitting consume and make-up in additional to incredible action sequences which was let down by a rather lackluster, clich√© and slightly flawed plot. Enjoyable movie but it was just missing that little bit.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

The Wonder Woman character when introduced in the Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice was received with an encouraging response. But, there were speculations over whether a standalone film on the character would really work. But Wonder Woman soared at the Box office, broke many jinxes and also has received a great response from critics. Patty Jenkins has done 'wonders' directing her first major motion picture.The movie tells us the origin story of Diana, princess of the Amazon race, where she and other Amazonians are away from the contact of the outside world. When Diana rescues the pilot Steve Trevor, who crashes his plane into their island Themyscira, she comes to learn about the World War I in a hard way. Trying to find her purpose, Diana leaves the island with Steve against her mother's will to end the World War I. Steve teams up with Diana to prevent Germans from using a mass destructive chemical weapon created by an evil scientist. The rest of the movie is about how Diana, Steve and their small team stops the German army general Erich Ludendorff, from using the mass destruction weapon. During this journey, Diana learns more about the humans, finds love and discovers her true identity.Although a Superhero movie, the film also dwells into other human elements which make the movie special. Kudos to the stunt team for some brilliant action sequences, especially involving the character Diana. The chemistry between Steve and Diana almost makes you feel like this is one of the best love stories ever told. The movie also makes sure not to fall short of humor which has been a very key element in the recent superhero movies. The background music and the slow-mo shots are bound to give Goosebumps to the audience. Gal Gadot has landed the role of her life in this movie. Wonder Woman suits her style, personality and also her beautiful face. Her dedication and hard work in preparing for the character reflects really well in the action sequences. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor is very adorable and is very sure leaves the audience wanting for more. Although Robin Wright doesn't have much screen time, she has a very powerful role. Other big names like Connie Nielsen, Danny Huston and David Thewlis do justice to their parts. But this movie is totally dominated by the lead characters Diana and Steve. Wonder Woman has to be the DC's best work yet after The Dark Knight trilogy. It is a very well told origin story of a superhero and is filled with emotions. Overall, this movie is not just a celebration of woman power, but it is the celebration of humanity. Wonder Woman makes you smile, it makes you cry and overall gives you a very satisfying movie experience.","12 out of 28 found this helpful.

Disclaimer: This review is coming from someone who has never consumed wonder woman media of any kind before this movie. I've never read the comics, seen any of the TV shows or anything. This review is based solely off this movie. Now me, I'm not really into super hero movies, but after hearing all the rave reviews about this one, I figured I would have to see it. And boy, I do not regret it. It was incredible. From start to finish this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat with heart-pounding action scenes, tense drama, lovable characters, a light to balance the darkness, and an overarching love story (familial love, friendly love, and romantic love)The beginning sets the tone with female warriors training, but also propels into the mythicality that drives the plot. We are introduced to young Diana and her home island. After being trained as the strongest warrior on the island, the one who will kill Ares, the God of War, a soldier, Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crashes into their secluded island, bringing with him a fleet of ships. This battle scene is the first that marks the serious tone that carries through the rest of the movie. What this film does really well that a lot of other superheroes origins fall short on is balancing the light and the dark. It is a serious movie, but it is also humorous. It's not overbearing but still able to maintain a dark element. A tough thing to pull off that should be commended on all levels. Gal Gadot, Chris Pine, and the ensemble manage to create such lovable characters from the first time you see them. Wonder Woman (Gadot) knows her way around HER world, but there are some things in the real world that she's experiencing for the first time (like snow and ice cream) and some social norms she can't quite wrap her head around (no women on the battlefield, unnecessary casualties in war). She also doesn't take any crap, an empowering quality all too lacking from most women in film. She doesn't want to hear your ""that's not how it works,"" or ""you can't do that,"" because who gets to decide that? Chris Pine creates and actually attractive love interest. He's charismatic and funny without being Trademark Charismatic and Funny. As someone who never read the comics, the story as a complete surprise for me, and kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It kept me guessing, and never fell flat. Even though I had accidentally read some spoilers before seeing it, everything was still a surprise as it was happening. The story doesn't lose sight of it's beginning, and carries through to the end as one story, not a collection of events. It keeps hold of the strength displayed in the first few minutes until the end credits roll. Yes, there is a CGI filled, everyone-go-at-it final act, but can you name one superhero movie that doesn't contain this? This movie is the first one I've seen in a long time that does it well, although it still hit a few snags along the way. I cannot recommend this movie enough. Not only is it fantastic that we get a female superhero movie, a box office smash from a female director, and a new series to look forward to, we also just got a really good movie that everyone, female and male, should see.","13 out of 31 found this helpful.

Director Patty Jenkins had kept the direction to the point with wonderful stop-motion slow-mo Fight sequences(best in 3D) Gal Gadot !!! This 'woman' has broken all the doubts people had on her casting. She just fit into her character so perfectly. This paved the way for further Female superhero lead movies to enter without being prejudiced.Special mention to Chris Pine, Robin Wright for their better supporting role alongside Gal gadot.

It's not easy to grasp the significance of a female director overseeing a female superhero movie based on a male written script. The use of culture clashing humor, the attempts at a female perspective of violence on an epic scale may not be sufficient to draw out the substantive and substantial gender distinction that one finds in the more intimate and relatable relational importance as one might find in Jennifer Garner's presentation, more human and vulnerable, but more emotive and compelling experience in the highly under-rated Elektra (2005). Operating on a smaller and personal scale using an even more powerful human/supernatural theme, its pacing and intimacy easily rivals Wonder Woman's blockbuster special effects bluster. Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft in Tomb Raider (2001) offers up a much more female perspective on violence oriented movies while even Uma Thurman's coming of new age in Kill Bill Vol. 2 (2004) captures the more demanding mental infusion of mind and body that is missing in Wonder Woman.While perhaps the male critics and the women audience members might enjoy the shift in superhero focus, overall, this movie doesn't quite break the bright line of the summer action testosterone action figure blockbuster theme and performance that many suggest it does. Even with the 3-D, the technical quality still hasn't achieved that reality-based visual impact that 3-D potential offers. Hugo (2011) and its 3-D from six years ago still holds up better. Maybe the likely Wonder Woman stand-alone sequel that this initial origin movie justifies will bring a more starkly dramatic and comic fantasy franchise with an emphasis on intimate emotive values such as seen on television like The Magicians (2015-2017) offers.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is one of the best superhero movies since The Dark Knight. And kudos to director Patty Jenkins and the wonderful Gal Gadot. She really has a great chemistry with Chris Pine. I would recommend this to everyone especially comic book fans. For the Amazon princess herself, Wonder Woman. Before she was Wonder Woman, she was Diana Prince. As a young lass, Diana wants to become like her mother, Hippolyta, to protect the world from war god, Ares. Like what she said, Truly, only love can save the world. Gal Gadot really gave a brilliant performance as the Amazon princess. Wonder Woman was one of DC's most beloved superheroes. This film has a brilliant acting and picturesque cinematography and cool action and humor. Everyone stole the show. So far, this is one of 2017's best movies.

First we see Diana as a child then as an adult training to be the best of the amazon warriors. This part is a little weird because when you think amazon warrior you don't think water nymph popping out of the sea to spread the message of LOVE AND PEACE.
Second part Diana goes to London during WWI with a mission of spreading LOVE AND PEACE... by killing Ares the god of war, because obviously we start peace by spilling blood. Thankfully the fish out of water thing is quick and painless.
Third part we are going to war and it's to bring LOVE AND PEACE by killing those on the German side.
As preachy as this movie is it seems like what they're saying and what they're doing contradicts each other.
In the end Gal Gadot is amazing in the role and you always got the sense that Wonder woman was someone larger than life, dignified and with her eyes on the prize.

After having been introduced to Gal Gadot's Diana Prince in 2016's 'Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice,' we get to see the Amazonian woman's origin story, from her upbringing on a secluded Mediterranean island to her direct impact on fighting the ""world to end all wars."" After rescuing a downed American spy (Chris Pine) and fighting off a wave of Germans, we get to see Gadot's character go through many experiences that change her life in a short period of time. As she's bent on defeating the god Ares, who she is convinced is behind the death and destruction ravaging the globe, Diana discovers her godlike powers and realizes how unique she really is.While Gadot is clearly the main attraction in 'Wonder Woman,' there are some strong supporting performances by the likes of Robin Wright (Antiope), Connie Nielsen (Hippolyta) and David Thewlis (Sir Patrick). Sure - there is something to be said about the inconsistent accents, but these are not as distracting as they could have been. Again, perhaps 'Wonder Woman's best attribute is that it is not over-the-top and is first and foremost an action-drama set in WWI-era Europe. Despite the serious backdrop, there's plenty of laughs to go around, as well, most of which revolve around Diana's unfamiliarity with the modern world.But everything about 'Wonder Woman,' from the way it was filmed to the special effects, is first-rate when compared with other films in the genre. There were plenty of critiques and high expectations to go around before its release, whether deserved or not, and it's good to see 'Wonder Woman' really lived up to the hype.If it had been poorly received, this could have been the nail in the coffin for the current DC Comics film series, but it appears 'Wonder Woman' was just the jolt that was needed.","10 out of 23 found this helpful.

Just returned and I was so pleased at how well the story unfolded and how quickly 2 hours and 20 minutes passed. I purposely avoided spoilers. I read other reviews (non-spoiler) that claimed the 2nd act dragged. I didn't think it dragged at all. It was important to set up the third act and contained most of the humor. Gal Gadot shines brilliantly and IS Wonder Woman. All those detractors have some major crow to eat. She is beautiful, strong, engaging, convincing and amazing in the action sequences. Her presence is undeniable and those who whined that she was too...( fill in the blank) will be forced to reassess after seeing this movie. Story is tight. Chris Pine is excellent as a co-star but it's Gal's movie. The finale is impressive and leaves little doubt that Diana becomes a powerful force for good. She is what the DCEU Superman needs to evolve into and the one who can keep Batman on track. Her message of love and hope were strong and Patty Jenkins did a great job of mixing in humor, narrative, moving sequences and great, fun action. I will be seeing it again.","11 out of 26 found this helpful.

There, I said it. The challenge before Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot was a formidable one; bring the legendary superhero to life on the big screen for her first solo adventure, and do it in such a way that it blows away the ridiculous conventions that have long dogged female-fronted superhero films. Even Marvel, as progressive as they are, shied away from giving Scarlett Johansson a chance to fly solo as the popular and complex Black Widow. This is a pressure not easily handled, especially with the entire DC film universe to this point being largely disappointing in the eyes of critics, and divisive among audiences. DC needed a break, a fine film that could finally show that its universe could be every bit as good as Marvel's. Enter Gal Gadot. The decision to insert Wonder Woman into Batman vs. Superman, and get the mythical Trinity on the screen at the same time, was masterful. Gal Gadot was made for this role; tall, stunning, and naturally Mediterranean, as Diana should be. Add to that the single best entrance a superhero has ever made, complete with a guitar-licking theme, and audiences and critics alike reached agreement. No matter their thoughts on the overall film, she was a highlight. So, the torch was passed to Patty Jenkins for the titular origin story, and she ran with it. The implications of this film's success are well documented, and it finally does break through the fog of the other DC films. We see Diana, the secrecy of her birth in tow, grow to become the great warrior before leaving with Steve Trevor and entering World War I. Her innocence and naivete upon entering our world makes for a complex thread as she spends more and more time around man while seeking her quarry. She sees man's pain, suffering, and simple pleasures, and even despite her singular belief as to what must happen, she becomes emotionally grounded, which becomes key when the climax arrives. The big reveal is compelling, and Jenkins does a fantastic job at dangling lines out there before reeling it in with a terrific, if long, battle sequence. Gal Gadot has made a star turn here, and future Wonder Woman sequels are sure to happen, as this film delivers on all counts: Diana's relationship with Trevor is multifaceted, funny and interesting, and produces some truly touching moments. The action sequences are exciting and gloriously fun, and that moment when Diana casts aside her cloak and steps forth in her full armor the first time is mesmerizing. The DC Universe now has its first truly great film. Ball's in your court, Marvel.","11 out of 26 found this helpful.

It has a strong story, excellent action sequences and packs an emotional punch, but ultimately results to nosediving during the third act. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine are near perfect in their respective roles as Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor; Gadot in particular is one of the film's best parts. The story moves along at an impressive rate, thanks in no small part to Jenkins' powerful direction. But ultimately, every film has three acts, and the first two in this picture were brilliant. After walking out of the cinema following the third act however, I felt underwhelmed; David Thewlis is totally miscast as antagonist Ares, and the the dialogue he says during the final battle is very shoddy. The climax itself is just a cacophony of loud noise and overwhelming explosions, and feels oddly rushed in contrast to the rest of the film. Another minor criticism I have is the depth deprived nature of the secondary villains, which really detracts from the reality of the time specific setting for the film, as well as the underused supporting cast, who seem to only be there to make up the numbers. However, I found the film entertaining enough, and lighter in comparison to BVS, which is a change I definitely approve of. Whilst DC are still strides behind Marvel in terms of film quality, Wonder Woman is certainly a step in the right direction.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

In real life, Wonder Woman breathes new life into the DC Extended Universe. Marvel has been formulaic but successful when it comes to creating their movie universe, while the Warner Bros/DC approach so far has been flawed, risky and divisive. Director Patty Jenkins though sets everything right with one of the most nuanced superhero origin movies ever made.The plot though stays close to the comics, only trading one war of another. The year is 1918, the war that was meant to end all wars is still on with millions of casualties on both sides. The Amazons are in Themiscyra, hidden from the rest of the world. Diana is the daughter of Zeus, and is just beginning to realize her powers when Steve Trevor, British spy comes knocking into Themiscyra, with a bunch of Germans behind him. After a brief skirmish, the Amazonians come to know of the ongoing confrontation, and the intention of certain people to prolong it. Diana guesses that the God of War Ares is manipulating the war and decides to eliminate him. The rest of the movie is about Diana's understanding that humanity consists of both good and bad and this is what makes them unique, and in the process herself transform from a powerful Amazonian, to a god.Patty Jenkins keeps it simple- a wry script, fast pace, rocking background score, great fight sequences and terrific visuals are key her ingredients. Couple that with her ability to extract excellent performances from the entire star-cast, and no wonder you have a billion $ movie coming right up.As compared to Zack Snyder's gritty dark takes, Wonder Woman is a mood uplifting movie. By the time it ends, you truly believe that there is hope left in this world. And that itself is Diana Prince's true superpower. Go on and enjoy a movie that will truly brighten up your day. 10/10","11 out of 26 found this helpful.

It may sound like nit-picking, but for a film centred on what it can provide to its audience in a visual sense, it's a big no-no.Aside from some questionable CGI and lacking baddies (complete in one scene with a moment of almost Dr. Evil like laughter at their dastardly plans) Wonder Woman's other unfortunate element is the fact that it seems as though the studio for all its talk and bluster, was afraid to let Wonder Woman fully take centre stage in her own film.Tagged in the majority of the runtime with Pine right alongside her, as our Godly princess learns the ropes of the outside world and her own true powers, Pine gets to play a version of his Enterprise captain and have almost equal screen time as Gal Gadot's incarnation, which is both a shame for the movie and for Gadot who really is the shining beacon of this otherwise standard event.As she showcased in limited yet memorable screen time in Batman vs Superman, Gadot feels like the perfect fit for an icon like Diana Prince.Showcasing the physical prowess, the smarts and the charisma the character needs, Gadot will no doubt become a newly minted superstar of the DC universe and whenever Gadot is allowed to take centre stage and get away from forced romantic flirtations with Pine or awkward costume fittings, Wonder Woman in full flight is a joyous sight to behold thanks to Gadot's career making turn and hopefully a reason for future standalone events to take further time to shine the spotlight on her character and her screen presence.From running headfirst into the battlefields of Europe or beating up goons in the back alleys of old school London, you can't help but escape the feeling that Gadot and therefore Wonder Woman had more to give to this film than was eventually allowed.Final Say ‚Äì Overcoming a rather laborious and cringe worthy opening act as well as some second rate visuals culminating in an unfortunately mediocre final stanza, when Wonder Woman herself is front and centre of this superhero film (with less of a difference than many would have you believe) it's a fun popcorn event that sets up a nice stepping stone for future adventures.As long as they agree to let Gadot do her thing without the help of a male offsider.3 Captain Kirk doppelgangers out of 5","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

My actions here speak louder than the words in this review.Warner Bros. and DC Comics have released their fourth installment of the DCEU following Man of Steel, Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad. These previous films all had a mixed reception between critics and audiences, however, with Wonder Woman, this is not the case. Currently sat at a critical and audience score of 93% on Rotten Tomatoes this film is being constantly praised, and too right.The dramatic and comedic tones were perfectly balanced. Such a glaring omission from the previous DC offerings was any real feeling of levity. Jokes were well timed and delivered perfectly. The comedic lines were not out of place or shoved in to appease those looking for a lighter superhero film, but were relevant to the location or event. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine's chemistry was automatic and more convincing than grass being green. The romance wasn't shoved down our necks straight away, the film took it's time to allow the chemistry to flourish and develop.Even before Wonder Woman, DC films have one shining quality to them, music. There is something to be said for the theme song of this movie which was featured in Batman v Superman as well. Try to hum the theme to the Avengers. How about Captain America? The most recent Spider- man? The majority of people will not be able to do this, as the music to Marvel films are unrecognizable. However, dating back to Christopher Reeves Superman, all DC films (with a few exceptions) have a recognizable theme. Wonder Woman's theme is visceral and will be immediately recognizable after you've heard it. It's featured in key moments of the film, adding to the weight of the already powerful action.To me, this film was reminiscent to the original Christopher Reeves Superman films from the 70's and 80's. The film was purely dark and gloomy the entire time, it allowed itself to be hopeful and be whimsical.As this film is set during World War One, we are treated to an astounding scene in No Man's Land where Diana deflects hundreds of bullets with her shield and forges the path for the British soldiers. Her reasons for doing this was to end the suffering of the soldiers and civilians from the German army. On her way, she encountered many injured from battle and those grieving. Steve Trevor, a realist kept reminding Diana that there was nothing she could do to help them, until she reached No Man's Land and proved that an idealist can also prevail. From her courage and determination she was able to save the British soldiers and liberate a small village that was previously under German control. Diana's innocent and loving ideology is the main theme of this film in every scene and is conveyed so convincingly it brought tears to my eyes at many moments.Diana's reasoning for being at the front-line was to kill Ares (the God of War) who she believed was the cause and reason of this war. During the film, the audience have no certain idea on who Ares is, giving another sense of mystery and intrigue to the film, other than, ""we know who the bad guy is, the hero will find him and kill him yay!"". When we see Ares we are treated to an oil painting of stunning visual effects and amazing character development. However, I'm not going to spoil the ending, but one criticism would be how many of the dialogue in the final battle from Ares is very clich√©, with lines such as, ""I will destroy you!"". Do not get me wrong, the scene is incredible, but you cannot help but think it is slightly overused in many films.Wonder Woman balances loving ideology, Greek mythos, warfare and humor in one masterfully crafted package. The film also lacks predictability and does not have a clich√©d ""Hollywood Ending"". Even if you are someone who is not a fan of superhero films, you can easily watch this film and enjoy it fully.I could go on for pages and pages writing about how amazing this film is, but this is a review, not a nerdy analysis, so go and see the film. I highly recommend this film to anyone and everyone. This is the superhero film that will hopefully set the tone for Justice League and all other upcoming DC Comics films.Overall Rating: 10/10","11 out of 26 found this helpful.

Ares has finally been portrait properly on film, he has earned his place between the big boys in movie villain kingdom. This is the true Ares every DC fan knows, loves and fears. Thewlis deserves any and every movie award known to man for this brilliant display!Jenkins has made her ""I will always be remembered"" movie, this is the crown-jewel in her portfolio. Perfect directing, perfect story, perfect balance between action and drama, everything is perfect. Even if you hate DCEU, you will love this film. If you don't, then something is ""Definitely"" wrong with you!!!","13 out of 32 found this helpful.

With acclaimed female director Patty Jenkins at the helm, does this film finally surpass the critical stomping of both 'Dawn of Justice' and 'Suicide Squad'?1. To be perfectly blunt, 'Wonder Woman' indeed (with the exception of 'Man of Steel') lifts the depressing curtain of the DCEU. This film exceeded my expectations by far and no one could wipe the proud smile off my face leaving the theater. After Superman flew across the sky in 2013, it took DC four years to raise the bar back up to a level in which I thought 'Man of Steel' succeeded (as far as origin stories go). Was it a flawless movie?......No. Does it succeed in parts where it's good?......in spades. When Wonder Woman/Diana Prince made her debut in 'Dawn of Justice', I can honestly say that I wasn't that impressed, nor was I a fan of Gal Gadot since I thought of her as a mediocre actress at best. However, I'm often glad to be proved wrong.2. Having Zack Snyder (Man of Steel/Dawn of Justice) and David Ayer (Suicide Squad) at the reins up to this point, it took a woman like Patty Jenkins to finally turn things around. With 'Monster' being her claim to directorial fame, Jenkins will definitely be remembered for this now, as well she should be. Of course Gal Gadot will be the most outstanding hero of the DCEU, that is unless Aquaman, The Flash or Green-Lantern decide to steal the show in their respective films lol. Even tho I still think her acting is not on the level of great, Gadot does manage herself well enough to were I genuinely felt for her character as the film progressed. Being a guy, it's kinda hard to relate to a female lead based on my gender, but it doesn't divert from how good I thought she was.3. However, the true acting spirit and the most relatable character to me, was Chris Pine as Cpt. Steve Trevor. Even though it's easy to get lost in his blue eyes, Pine steals every scene he's in and his chemistry with Gadot is easily better than that of Superman & Lois Lane. For the first time in this universe was I caught up in the love-story, and Chris Pine is just a beautiful man altogether;) Reading my review so far, you'd think my rating should be higher, but as I mentioned earlier, the film has flaws. Mainly....the villains, not the best, pretty weak and lazy; that's how I'd describe them. Apart from Dr. Poison (Elena Anaya) and Gen. Ludendorff (Danny Huston), there is a third antagonist who is revealed during the climax, but my review is spoiler free.4. As with every DCEU climax, this one is no different as it boils down to a CGI-fest for the final sequence. Even though it's more focused than the other films' climax battles, it sorta (but not completely) takes away from the emotion the movie was trying to convey at that point. I'll admit that there was a moment in the last action sequence that got me a little teary-eyed in which Steve and Diana talk. The last time I cried was in 'Man of Steel' and I'm not too proud to admit it. Despite the heavy use of slow-motion shots in the very first action sequence when the Amazons storm the beach, everything from then on works really well. Audiences can now see the sheer power Wonder Woman possesses along with her superhuman skill- set and combat abilities.I wish I could give this film a higher rating than I have, but with time to reflect, there were just some unforgivable errors made in which the DC filmmakers should have picked up on, seeing as how it costed them in the past. All in all, I had a great time, and despite it's flaws, 'Wonder Woman' was indeed a success.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

They are all flesh and blood, vulnerable Wonder Women who prevail; not immortal, but dealing with their mortality without the aid of super-human powers, lacking a sword and shield, steel wrist band bracelets, and breast plates. They are the breathing, conscious descendants of the mythic phenomenal Wonder Woman - the D.C. comics Amazon warrior who has the physical prowess of the greatest male warriors - a woman who captured my imagination as a young girl, when I was fighting to be seen and treated as the equal of the boys around me.From the DC Comic database - some history on the origins of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman:Diana is the daughter of Queen Hippolyta, the first child born on Paradise Island in the three thousand year history that the immortal Amazons lived there. The Amazons had been created around 1200 B.C. when the Greek goddesses drew forth the souls of all women who had been murdered by men and placed them on the island. One soul was held back from creation, the one that would be born as Diana. That soul originally belonged to the unborn daughter of the first woman murdered by a man (whom Hippolyta was the reincarnation of). In the late 20th Century, Hippolyta was instructed to mold some clay from the shores of Paradise Island into the form of a baby girl. Six members of the Greek Pantheon then bonded the soul to the clay, giving it life. Each of the six also granted Diana a gift: Demeter, great strength; Athena, wisdom and courage; Artemis, a hunter's heart and a communion with animals; Aphrodite, beauty and a loving heart; Hestia, sisterhood with fire; Hermes, speed and the power of flight. Diana grew up surrounded by a legion of sisters and mothers. When she was a young woman, the gods decreed that the Amazons must send an emissary into Man's World¬ÖBefore embarking on her mission, Diana was given the Lasso of Truth, forged by Hephaestus himself. She was also given the Sandals of Hermes, which allowed her to instantly traverse great distances in seconds. Diana's mission was one of peace, but part of it initially involved defeating a mad plot by Ares to destroy the world. http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Wonder_Woman_(Diana_Prince)Patty Jenkins the director of WONDER WOMAN charmingly recreates the idyllic Paradise Island - a peaceful enclave,where for many years the Amazons have been preparing and honing their battle skills for the return of Ares, the God of War - and the inevitable final clash between Good and Evil. We first view Diana - the future Wonder Woman - as a young mischievously headstrong child practicing in pantomime, echoing the slashing movements of swordplay, already fully confident of her own destiny.Once Diana has grown into the beautiful, shapely Wonder Woman (played by Gal Gadot, a former model whose acting skills regrettably do not provide the ""gravitas"" or range of emotions that would have elevated her role from being a 2-D cartoon character,) the commercial Hollywood block-buster entertainment industry takes over the movie. They do so by placing Diana in the midst of The Great War (W.W. I) complete with flaming infernos, British spies and German villains experimenting with chemical substances to be unleashed upon the civilian populations. And just to brighten the mood, lame sex jokes playing on Diana's naivet√© are regularly interspersed throughout the dialogue, revealing an innocence derived from being sheltered on a remote Island safeguarded from life's realities.Meeting her first man, Steve Trevor, an American pilot (a baby-faced blue-eyed Chris Pine played cute) - tumbling out of the sky with his plane diving through the barrier mist that enshrouds this secret enclave from interlopers (a Freudian interpretation might be relevant,) he crashes into the surrounding waters, and is saved by Diana from drowning. This archetype of a ""strange species"" called ""man,"" both fascinates and confuses our heroine; nonetheless she is quickly captivated by this handsome soldier and accompanies him outside of her insulated universe in order to fulfill her destiny and bring ""good"" back into the Ares-corrupted world. Having bitten from the apple in the Garden of Eden, she becomes acutely aware of the destructive malevolence of a landscape outside her own. The final scene in the movie is a spectacular light show of hell erupting with super-woman vaulting from one combat zone to another silhouetted against the glaring heat of combustion, as she saves humankind from the evils of darkness. We women can relate to that and applaud along with the audience in support of Wonder Woman's fight - though the special effects which attend the cataclysm resemble an amalgam of horror creatures and a wet, melting super monster. Diana's last words made me audibly groan and giggle: ""Only love can save the world."" What??? WONDER WOMAN's final message trivialized a film which had a lot of potential beyond redemption. Please Diana Prince go back to your Paradise and live among those other terrific Amazons - perhaps then you might regain my respect.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

However, the entire film feels slow and sluggish, with the focus on Diana and Steve's relationship taking center stage over the overarching threat of Ares. ""Wonder Woman"", at most times, feels like a drama rather than a comic book movie, resulting in the action sequences feeling very staged and out of place. However, credit where it's due - Patty Jenkins did a wonderful job of directing the film and it certainly feels like it belongs in the DCEU, but doesn't really match the pace that ""Man of Steel"" and the awe-inspiring ""Batman v.

Two, from a complete and whole film perspective, Oscar-worthy, if you will. While there is always a heavy debate about Oscars, no matter the opinion, 'Wonder Woman' entertained me from the very start to the very end. With an excellent blend of story, action, comedy, and so on, it truly has become one of my favorite superhero films. Gal Gadot hits a home-run playing WW. She owns this role and I truly hope there is a deep future for her in this role. The action thoroughly blew me away with the acceptance of some silly CG at times. I desperately hope Patty Jenkins will continue to have ties to the DC Universe because she led this film to greatness. As I sit and wonder where this ranks among comic book films; I can confidently say it sits among the top. Just under 'Logan' and resides among Marvel's best and clearly is the DC Extended Universe's best.-- Oberrated --","12 out of 29 found this helpful.

It makes some moment ment to be very powerful, just look silly. But don't get me wrong, there is funny moments, bad ass action sequences and absolutely no substance. I'm glad to see women getting more attention as action hero, but this shouldn't be a get out of jail free card for the entire movie. We need more diversity in movies, but we can't start mercy liking. We can't call bland run of the mill superhero movies for masterpieces, because the lead doesn't have male genitalia. But if you're looking for some brainless entertainment, this is definetly fine.

Everyone across the board that worked on this movie did a fabulous job and this is amply evident from; the amazing and nuanced performances to the assured direction to the resplendent cinematography to the beautiful, attentive production design and costume design. This a very different film from the previous two efforts in the DCEU, namely Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, in that it is a standalone story set in World War 1 which allows director Patty Jenkins to really home in on and redefine Wonder Woman for a new generation and that she does with great success in this movie. One thing I particularly admire about Patty Jenkins is her attitude towards Superheroes. She not so long ago said something along the lines of 'The word ""cheesiness"" is banned in my world' and it really shows. In a time of Superhero movies like Deadpool and Guardians of the Galaxy that wink at the camera at every opportunity, it was really refreshing to see a Superhero movie done earnestly and with a passion for seriousness. Also, Jenkins pays homage to classics of the genre such as Richard Donner's 1978 Superman and Sam Raimi's 2002 Spider-Man. If you have seen these two movies you will recognize the homages immediately when you see them. However, even with these qualities the movie is still very humorous due to the 'fish out of water' scenario Diana finds herself in from the second act onward. Gal Gadot is outstanding in this role. She displays naivety, compassion, wonder (no pun intended), bravery, strength and heroism with abundant aptitude. Chris Pine is also fantastic as Steve Trevor. They have bundles of chemistry together and the film really is elevated because of this. Lucy Davis is remarkable as Etta Candy and really leaves an impression despite her limited screen time.I heard some complaints about the villain in this movie, namely Ares the God of War, alluding to him being undeveloped. For me, these complaints don't hold any weight because in my view the real villain in this movie is not something physical but rather the darkness that lurks inside all humanity. The sign of a good hero-villain dynamic is that they compete for the same goal. That is what happens here. They are competing for the heart of mankind. Ares wants to reveal them as greedy, corrupt and dysfunctional and Diana believes that Man is good, kind and compassionate. In the end, she learns that they are a dichotomy of the two and it comes down to what people choose to be as she tells Ares what she learned from Steve Trevor: ""It's not about deserve, it's about what you believe and I believe in Love"". In summary, I could not recommend this movie enough. This is one of the best Superhero movies ever made.","12 out of 29 found this helpful.

It nice to come back with something that was this great and this enjoyable like Wonder Woman. First thing I would like to say is this movie touched me and made me feel so much better about the world we live in. It shows that in a world of darkness and depression like the rest of the DCEU has shown that we can get a film that shows that there is hope in our world and that there is hope in this franchise to truly be better than what it is now. This is what Superman really should be. So I wasn't shocked when I heard that Patty Jenkins models this movie of the original Superman films cause it really felt like that. There was so much love and care put into crafting who these characters really were at there core and that I really found myself connecting to. Each character was given such personality and felt like real live human beings. You can also feel Geoff Johns influence all over the film I would not be shocked at all if he was actually also writing the movie and juts chose to be uncredited cause this feels like something he would write. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor was such a stand out in this film. He was really one awesome character and was awesome to see a male in a movie about feminism still be shown like this. It helps male audiences and female audiences to be able to see each other as equals and not be radicalized like the Ghostbusters movie did. Speaking of which this is the way feminism needs to be done. This is the way that it needs to be executed. Showing a female character as a individual and also showing that she can stand besides her male counterparts. This movie does such a good job of making great and empowering statements that I think any woman can very much connect to. I mean I am no female myself, but I could see that maybe happening in this film. A lot of critics are hampering on the third act. And I don't see why. The third act I feel is very much needed and is what adds so much power to the film and the message it is trying to convey to the viewer that you really have to have it there. It is a really powerful climax and also a really epic one that I think you will enjoy. Overall I would highly recommend Wonder Woman to anyone. No matter who you are.I think there is a lot for you to enjoy.","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

But this very flawed pace allows the origin story of the amazonian warrior mature in a compelling build- up, and eventually navigate towards the rest of her story in a riveting seismic progression. It gathers an affectionate sentimentality that sustains its potency even amidst the imposing explosive sequences that often triumph to take the audience's attention away from the oddly satisfying distraction, that is Gal Gadot. There are these resonating anthems that remain ablaze throughout the film's 140-minute duration: love and peace, sacrifice and courage, and while it gets extremely preachy sometimes, the narrative rarely gets boring. Jenkins' take on the genre doesn't abandon the idea of terror, and mass destruction, but it singularly escapes the confines of superhero clich√©s that eliminate its players' moral form. In 'Wonder Woman', Diana Prince's humanity is held by Gadot's portrayal with a bracing commitment, something she never loses even when confronted with the deceptive appeal of evil and darkness. Her heroic verve gets an unexpected reinforcement from Chris Pine's Steve Trevor, with whom she shares a surprisingly inherent chemistry. This is the first DC film in a very long time, to ever sustain such visceral distinction, a visual extravaganza brimming with heart and reason.Diana Prince's story takes us to a mysterious island known as Themyscira, hidden by Zeus in a protective dome of dim and mist, far from the grasp of humanity. She grows to believe that it is her sacred duty to protect her world, not knowing such 'world' will include what is beyond the clouds. But when the first man arrives in a suspicious water- crash landing, she expands her understanding and begins to welcome the idea of defending whoever needs help in the other side. But this eagerness barely entirely rests on a moral responsibility; she believes that Ares, the God of War, and her inevitable nemesis, is what causing the war waged by humans, and she needs to kill him in order to restore peace to both worlds. In one spine-chilling moment within her breathtakingly choreographed fight sequence with Ares, Diana rises from a fall, and virtually carries out her meteoric ascent, a symbolic assumption of her superhero status.But in spite of the amount of physical tension and visual explosion, Jenkins balances the flavor by injecting humor and romance, utilizing them even in places where gripping action sequences are imminent. Chris Pine shines in his own moments, a remarkable feat for a character in a saga that seems to underscore women empowerment. There is a powerful moment where he grapples for words to ask for Diana's help to win the war; he practically breaks down, a stirring and moving scene to behold. Part of the film's colossal allure is its heart--it never loses it, doesn't intend to, and it grows to more awe-inspiring forms as it reaches a resonating, albeit predictable, resolution.It is ironic to think that Diana Prince isn't human, but appears to be the most one, when compared with her colleagues in the looming 'Justice League' film. In the end, 'Wonder Woman' isn't a film free of blemishes as it still stumbles upon political truths it rarely gets justified, and minor expositions it doesn't seem interested to shed light on. But it has soul, humor, and wonder-- a narrative spectacle one seldom finds in a film of its sort.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

She is raised on an isolated island and when a pilot crashes on their land, everything chases and she leaves her home in order to help this pilot to stop the war. She will also try to find her destiny and discover her true powers and limits.In general, I have to say that my expectations were very low before watching this film because of ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" which was very boring so, I was happily surprised when ""Wonder Woman"" was not a bad movie. It has plenty of action, it's an interesting movie with a well-written plot which makes the movie more interesting. In my opinion, it's the best DC movie until now but DC has room for improvement in order to just be compared with Marvel not surpass it because I find it extremely difficult. I liked the interpretation of Gal Gadot who played as Diana and Chris Pine who played as Steve Trevor. Despite that, I have to mention a moment in the movie that I didn't like and I will put it as a general term that would be good for movies with superheroes to be considered before the direction of it. When there is a reveal of a character and there is also a soundtrack behind this, it would be good if the combination of both is or happens the same time and especially in the correct moment in the movie.Finally, I have to admit that ""Wonder Woman"" is a good and interesting movie for everyone to watch and I strongly recommend it. If you hesitate of watching it because of the previous movies of DC like the ""Suicide Squad"" and ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice"" then I advise you to reconsider your opinion and watch this movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Not to mention the massive amount of plot holes though out the story. Who ever edited this movie needs to stop with the slow motion every fight scene there is at least 5 cuts to slow motion and boy it gets old quick. Also I don't see how I movie with an estimated 150 million dollar budget still can't do CGI well, if I'm a fight scene and a character does a massive flip in the air or something with a lasso the character because a rather obvious CGI character.

Some of the criticism has been justified (BatmanVSuperman was pure hot garbage) and a lot of it was completely unjustified (Suicide Squad has its gaping flaws, but I will fight to the death anyone who says it deserves the drubbing it got from film critics). But I think critics and fans are finally on the same page with Wonder Women. The claims of it saving the DCEU is a little much, but the claims of it being the best DCEU film as absolutely true! They tell Diana Price/Wonder Woman's origin story in a way that I can't see anyone not loving it.When you go to see this film, you will be pleasantly surprised by the themes explored. Yeah, there is a TON of girl power on display, but it never once feels like a lecture of how great women are and how awful men are! In fact, the main theme isn't that Women can save the world, but rather love can save the world! Other themes in the film that are explored are the duality of mankind, the horrors of war and why humanity feels the need to wage war.The plot is also a lot more detailed than most comic book movies, which is something that is probably long overdue as well. I don't wish to give too much away, but needless to say, they had managed to find a good balance between story, dialogue, and action. The Director Patty Jenkins deserves a lot of praise for deciding not to try and re-write the comic book movie formula, but instead try to adapt it to suit the kind of story she wanted to tell!The casting of this film was just about spot on! Chris Pine is perfect as U.S. Air Force Pilot and Spy Steve Trever who is not made to look compliantly defenseless compared to Gal Gadot's Wonder Women. He's a badass with a heart of pure gold in this adaptation. The supporting cast is brilliant from the Amazons to the Germans. I won't name those cast in those roles because I want you guys to be surprised and thrilled as I was when I watched in the cinema. However, If I am being honest Gal Gadot is not a strong actor. She's a little rigid, and I think her looks played a part in her being cast in the role of Diana Price/Wonder Woman as not nice as that may sound! But the material and the other actors she's working with are so good that she can manage to bring just enough to the role to make it work. Although too much of the film's comic relief and drama comes from the characters naivety and utter lack of knowledge of the outside world! After a while it gets annoying.All in all, I enjoyed the film immensely and have no issue saying that it is the best film in the DCEU thus far. It fills me with the hope that Justice League will not be as big of a disaster than I thought!Four and a half stars out of Five from me!","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

One wonders why it took such a long time for this movie to be made. And then you remember the WhatsApp forward ‚Äì It takes 6 hours to build a Toyota car but it takes 6 months to build a Rolls Royce. At last the wait is over. We get to see the Wonder Woman Origin story on the big screen - a film that fans will enjoy from start to end. The movie starts with a simple request, Diana is asked on how she became the Hero that she is and that's how we get to know her story. Diana was a rebellious kid and was always attracted to the art of fighting. Her mother was against it, but she gives up in the face of Diana's persistence. Diana is trained by Antiope, who is not only her aunt but also the best warrior of the troops of Themyscia. Here in a matter of few minutes we get to see Diana's transformation as a warrior. Then all of a sudden, a plane crashes with Steve Trevor inside it; he is being hunted by the German Army. What follows is a battle between German Soldiers and warrior women of Themyscira. This shakes up Diana and she decides leave home, go to the outside world and end all wars. Now we will see some fish-out-of-water moments which Diana undergoes, when she has to adjust herself to the outside world. Some scenes are funny and you will fall in love with Diana's innocence while she is getting used to the world. Soon her battle with the outside world begins and we get to see Diana as Wonder Woman. I got Goosebumps throughout this scene. Wonder Woman is a well-made movie. It's an action movie with some funny and romantic moments, which don't go overboard. Like how Dawn of Justice felt like it was shot in Noir/grey mode, this movie will expose you to the Sepia mode. One should realize that these modes set the tone of the movie. Effects are good and don't look over the top. Pace is bit uneven but it doesn't matter much. Rupert Gregson- Williams' score compliments both action and non-action scenes. Tina Guo's cello gives aggression to the Wonder Woman theme, originally composed by Hans Zimmer in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. In terms of performance, all supporting actors have done justice to their roles. I wish Robin Wright had got some more screen time. Chris Pine plays Steve Trevor who handholds Diana when out of her comfort zone and is also her love interest. Now let's talk about Gal Gadot. She fills up the role of Wonder Woman with the soul it deserves; you can feel her struggle, strength, innocence & love. When she was cast as Wonder Woman, it received lot of criticism, but after watching this movie I can say that she has proved herself with her stunning performance. There is a scene where she feels a snowfall for the first time and her astonishment is so genuine that one can relate to it. (Four months ago I experienced snow for the first time and I had a similar reaction.) Her expressions while she is having ice cream for the first time or while wearing glasses are so innocent that you see a child in a woman who is a born warrior. Her muscles are toned, not bulky but visible enough to display the physical training Wonder Woman has received from childhood. She has carried herself effortlessly in all the costumes. You can also see how much effort Gal has put in for all the action scenes when you see her fighting. In short she nails the role of Wonder Woman. This movie is not about war but it is about taking measures to stop it. War is created by someone who can't see people happy and wants to manipulate them with hideous intentions. Verdict: 4/5","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

Personally, I wished to see more mythology on the Greek gods and Princess Diana in this film, but the WWI parts are still interesting. The costumes were historically correct, and the music fit perfectly. Plus, the villains were pretty wicked. The film also had a great message about good and evil as well. I hope to see more Wonder Woman films in the future, and hopefully there will be more lore as well. I honestly can't see why there would be hate on this.

The film was a pretty bad rehash of the first captain American movie with a hint of thor and the new DCEU movie feel which is getting old quickly.Bad cast bad music rolled into a story that could have worked had the setting not felt so recently familiar and had wonder woman actually come across like a strong badass character instead of scrawny weak looking ""hero"" she was never all that interesting in the comics in all fairness when she started out and only stood out later on for the fact she was barbaric and wasn't against taking the life of a villain if she felt it was the right thing to do even making the justice league turn their backs on her at one point for snapping the neck of maxwell lord.... but this movie was clearly just made to keep feminists happy and it seems to have done the trick but like with the ghostbusters franchise if you are an actual fan of the franchise before the new movie then you will be sorely disappointed.In short in this movie she is less of a conan the barbarian or red sonja in this movie and more like xena warrior princess, honestly you want a real wonder woman movie just go rewatch red sonja and call it a day, DC haven't saved anything in my eyes yet. I feel they should have gone with supergirl or something and gotten her angsty character traits down perfectly with her rage and a great movie could come from it.","20 out of 42 found this helpful.

However based on the fact, that they are apparently immortal (at least they do not age) one could say that they are not your average humans.With that out of the way I think the idea of portraying the Amazons as the reasonable faction that is supposed to keep men from being influenced in a negative way, is rather ridiculous.In real life women are much more easily influenced on an emotional level and men are actual the rational ones. So that about the premise.In terms of the movie I can say that visually is looks good and the sound effects are very well done. The performance of the actors is also very good.However the bad guy is dragging down the movie overall as his reveal comes out of the blue and the character just isn't threatening.The movie made me chuckle a few times, so that is a bonus.

It has the disadvantage of being associated with the other films of the DCEU, and that is a shame since the film is quite excellent, there's actually a story that keeps you interested. Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman varies between good character to confusing character, but Gadot makes the character her own and by the end of the film you will not be able to see anyone as Wonder Woman but Gadot. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor made the film feel grounded and gave a lot of heart to it, watching him and Gadot have scenes where its just banter and is probably improvised make the movie great. The music is alright and fits the standard for okay superhero movie music, not relying 100% on ZImmer and JunkieXL's music only when it needs to, and that makes it great, showing that they won't rely simply off of ""badass"" music. The villain and the big twist towards the end is very weak and makes for an awful final fight similar to the doomsday fight in 'Dawn of Justice'. The final fight and the special effects are what bring this movie down. The special effects in this film are awful, obvious green screen during combat and reused shots of Gadot leaping in the air. The cgi is awful and very noticeable. The big ""twist"" is equivalent to picking the background character as the villain. Of course you would be shocked but the film never even hinted at it and the final villain could've been anyone. This film presents an excellent female lead for young children to look up to, and is a very inspirational film with a lot of heart. The film overall is fun and a step in the right direction for DC.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Having grown up on the TV series, various cartoons starring the Amazing Amazon; especially the incredible Justice League animated series and feature films, I can say wholeheartedly that this is by far her best movie.Raised as a princess on the fabled island of Themyscira, Diana sets out to be a hero among the world of man, which has been fraught with brutality, violence, and war. Will she succeed, or fail? When Gal Gadot was cast as the titular heroine, many doubted she could pull of the role; mainly due to not just acting, but also the physicality of it as for years, Wonder Woman has been depicted as tall, muscular, and voluptuous. Keep in mind, that was and is the comics version, but when she showed up in Bvs, everyone was BLOWN AWAY!! Not only is she physically capable in the role, but also bringing to it emotion, heart, vulnerability, and of course, good 'ol fashion asskicking.Most of the other cast are really good in their roles. Chris Pine, David Thewlis, and Connie Nielson, all turn in great performances as Steve Trevor, Hippolyta,and Sir Patric respectfully. I really enjoyed the scenes set during World War 1, as the costumes and mannerisms, and weaponry are historically accurate. But like with any comic book movie, several liberties are taken, which is to be expected of the genre, but do nothing to dampen the overall experience. The only issues I can think of are certain scenes that have no explanation; especially when one of Diana's beloved friends meets an untimely demise, no scene of presenting the Lasso of Truth, and WW's iconic spin. Had those scenes been in the movie, it would've been really awesome; not only for paying homage to the comics, but the iconic TV series starring Lynda Carter as well.Action, romance, humor, some touching moments, but still that rocket-fire fuel of comic book action is all here and there and the direction of Patty Jenkings really makes it come to life on the big screen. Wonder Woman is the best film starring the titular heroine we all know and love. Though it's a bummer we didn't get a end credits scene, the film's box-office success is more than assurance that this won't be the last we see of Wonder Woman.Go see this film. It's really good.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

They made a television show featuring her back in the 70's starring Lynda Carter and was probably the first introductions of her to me as a child as well as the old Justice League cartoons they used to air all the time. A bit surprising that it took so long for her to be featured in a film, but not surprised by the success this movie is having as it was good. It also features a new character and I do believe that is another reason it has been successful. DC seems to be only good at getting Batman and Superman up onto the big screen. Granted, they did Green Lantern too, but I may have enjoyed that one a bit, most however turned their backs on it. I do not think though, that this is the best comic book film ever as some reviewers claim as I can think of many that I thought were better; however, this was a good one. Like a lot of films these days though, it did run a little long, but so many go over two hours. At least this one showcased the hero a lot more than other films. Watch a Transformers film and you get so much padding that is unnecessary while they shy away from showing any action, while this one has Diane battling rather early.The story has a race of women known as Amazons living on an island that is hidden from the rest of the world. On it a young child resides whose mother is queen. Diane wants to learn how to fight, but her mother is a bit hesitant. The mother's sister convinces the mother that Diane needs to know how to fight and thus her training begins. When sparring she displays a power that seems more unnatural and powerful than even her fellow Amazons posses. A plane flies through the dome that hides the island and soon Diane learns of a war that is killing millions. She wishes to stop this war and goes with the pilot, Steve, to London where he assembles a rag tag group to try and find a chemicals weapon plant where a chemist known as Dr. Poison works to make a chemical weapon that will render gas masks useless. However, Diane's main goal is to find the god of war, Ares whom she believes responsible for the deadly war plaguing the world.I enjoyed this film as Gal Gadot does a good job as Wonder Woman/Diane. When she first arrives in London it is humorous watching her try and fit in and get clothes. Chris Pine does a nice job too playing essentially her love interest. The film also kept me guessing as to who the bad guy was going to be. I knew the one guy was too obvious, but in the end I did not figure out who it was until they revealed themselves.So the film was good and it had more action than I was expecting as a couple of people I know almost made it sound like a chick flick or something. No, it is most certainly a comic book film, in fact I would compare it to another war time comic book film, Captain America. Only in this one you do have Diane's naivety of the world outside her island differentiating it from that film as well that this one was set during World War I rather than the second World War. I have enjoyed all the DC films thus far, unlike a lot of people. I thought Man of Steel, Suicide Squad were both really good and rank this one with those and all three are better than Batman versus Superman. I am only counting the ones in this new shared universe and not going back any further than Man of Steel. So good film, nice action and a wonderful start for the most well known female superhero.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

However enter Wonder Woman, the movie was not good as what I expected. The movie last more than 2 hours, countless romantic scenes made me almost fall asleep. I am not a D.C. fan and never read comics, I don't know about the original plots. But this movie plot is definitely outdated.In a scale of 10, 5/10 to the boring plot and average CGI, and 2/10 to the beautiful Princess Diana. However, I found this character - Diana is very two-dimensional, not to say boring, yet simple and lacking depth. Princess Diana is more like a fanciful image for the men. A gorgeous Ancient Greek like goddess born with superpowers, having supreme wisdom(languages) and curious, being innocent to the world and knowing nothing to mankind, willing to save the world and easily falling in love with a man. Besides, her costume is amazing, the cast looks amazing on every screen.What after the beauty of Diana? Cool action fighting? War scenes or CGI? There is nothing remarkable, the story plot is really stiff. Two hours? About a little innocent goodness's human world adventure and her romantic story.It bums me out because Wonder Woman failed to meet my expectation. Look at Marvels iron man, Superman, Thor, and Dr.strange. Maybe it is not fair to compare?","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Let's hope the results of this opening weekend's box office(ending 6/4/17) starts to crack that glass ceiling in Hollywood. Overall Wonder Woman does a great job of balancing seriousness, humor, and action. The cast plays off each other so well that you can forgive the few minor missteps in some side-story plot devices & in the 3rd act that are used the story.The ensemble cast works so well together and scenes between Godot and each character are written so well and acted so realistically that you forgive those small missteps. Godot is so good. So good at the physical, emotional, and naivete/fish out of water tightrope that she needed to walk to make this film work. You walk with Godot in every step throughout the film and through her she allows you to believe in her and in something greater. With everything, Diana's experiencing in this new world and everything happening currently in our world; you want to believe. After watching this movie it is my belief Godot will be the hero for several generations inspiring young and old. If you weren't crushing on Chris Pine before. I promise you will now. Don't worry, we'll make room for you on the bandwagon. Wonder Woman is not a perfect film. It doesn't have to be. It's a great film. It's a damn fine film. It's the perfect film to launch an era. An era that should not have to exist. In 2017 can't the director list be 25/25/25/25 and have more shades than white?Jenkin's ""WW"" is currently the best film the DCEU has to date. Godot has consistently been a bright light in this developing universe. Honorable mention for Affleck's portrayal of Wayne/Batman as being one of the best. Let's hope the bonfire that was lit this weekend provides enough illumination to the Powers-That-Be that says two things: One - let directors - direct. Two - open up the field - men aren't the only gender that can direct.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

It's a journey as long as a Lord of the Rings episode, but which doesn't feel as arduous or elongated. 'Wonder Woman' is an action and adventure film masked as a romance and drama, soldering juxtaposed elements such as femininity and brevity with love and the sordid realities of world wars.In the end, Diana must strip herself of all reservations and personal fears, and embrace her destiny fully, in order to overcome an unexpected foe and save humanity from its semi-self inflicted affliction.'Wonder Woman' is a bold introduction to the super-heroine who is so important to the balance of the testosterone-driven male dominated cast of the Justice League that will set a precedent for DC Comics films at least for the next decade.","7 out of 15 found this helpful.

I also loved the backdrop of World War One. The downfalls of this movie was the villains, overuse of cgi, and the final act. I wish they would have tried to stick with a villain that was a real person not an enhanced human and a god. The cgi in some places was bad and wasn't even necessary. Especially the battle at the end was boring and they had so many good practical shots earlier in the movie why did they would pollute the final battle with so much garbage cgi?

If like me you hated Batman v Superman, Man of Steel and Suicide Squad, then don't worry because Wonder Woman is gonna make the DC cinematic universe great again.I did not want to get too excited for this movie considering the disasters DC had released, but after seeing the trailers I got more and more excited. I would not say that I am a marvel fan, but so far I enjoy some of the movies of Marvel like: Doctor Strange or The Avengers 1 or Iron Man 1, whereas the DC movies were just dull and slow for me since Zach Snyder took over. This wonder woman movie however was different, this one was actually good, which coincidentally was not directed by Zach Snyder. Things I loved:Things that could be improved:Slow motion: While there were moments in which the slow motion was cool, sometimes it felt a bit to much. Sometimes it felt like they were trying too hard to make Wonder Woman even more cool that she already is. I think some shots would have looked better if they just let the scene flow without those little moments with slow motion, but its not that big of a deal anyways.CGI at the 3rd act: The first act and the second act were super close to total perfection, something i had not seen in a movie in a long time, the problem comes in the 3rd act and you can tell this is Zach Snyder doing as a producer in this movie. The villain in the movie is just the typical clich√© CGI villain. It isn't a memorable villain like the Joker or Bane or Loki...Gal Gadot acting: She is not the greatest actress the world has ever seen, but she definitely looks like WonderWoman.Her acting is not to great she has room for improvement there, but overall it doesn't affect the movie at all, and you are more focused on the story and the cool scenes and the dialogues with Chris Pine, Robin Wright than the acting of Gal Gadot.","13 out of 33 found this helpful.

I walked away with the impression that this was a pretty standard superhero movie. It had all of the same flaws I see in move movies in the genre; the plot was pretty predictable, dialogue was cliche, etc. The rating IMDB gave seems a bit overly generous to me, and I'd be surprised if that wasn't related to the narrative (i.e. feminist) that accompanied this movie. Overall, if you're into superhero movies you'll probably like this one but it certainly isn't anything exceptional that'd warrant someone who isn't into superhero movies to give it a shot. For the record, I don't recall the plot being overwhelmed by feminist sentiment... I think it was just the perception, that it's the first female superhero movie, that gave birth to the idea that this movie is intended to be some sort of 'rebellion against the patriarchy'.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Wonder Woman herself is excellent, and makes a strong argument in favor of including more female superheroes. Positive messages are here, but not epic feels in your heart. One good character is not enough. I'm sure other people liked Chris Pine's character more than I did though. He wasn't bad, just not particularly interesting. They seem to have relegated him to the traditionally female role (which itself needs to be fixed) of being 1 dimensional and without much depth or thought. Like his character exists entirely as a romantic interest and as eye candy; which is typically how film treats women. That aside, everything works well together until the finale. Which has the result of establishing a lot of forward momentum throughout the film only for that momentum to cause hard skidding against the ground when the end falls flat on its face.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Exactly What the DCEU and World Needs","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3721498/?ref_=tt_urv","ThomasDrufke","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur39517558/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2017","To say Wonder Woman is exactly the film we need right now is understatement. Not only is the DCEU in the midst of 2 critical bombs, off-camera issues, and desperate fans, but the world itself needs a bit of saving. There's so much hatred in the world that seeing a character like Wonder Woman set such a beautiful example in her ways is incredibly inspiring, and I mean both the character and the film itself. Action-packed, funny, and surprisingly touching, Wonder Woman is not just the film to save the DCEU, but it could very well reinvigorate the superhero genre once again.I might as well say upfront that Gal Gadot kills it as Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. Even after an all too brief appearance in last year's Batman v Superman, I had my doubts that she could lead a franchise on her own. While I can still see some room to grow, her charisma, physicality, and chemistry with Chris Pine is the backbone of this film. Her smile is infectious, her punch is fist pump worthy, and her stature is awe inspiring and admiring. It's almost to the point where I'm having a hard time seeing anyone else in the role.I hadn't seen any of Patty Jenkins work before this, and I became instantly interested in checking out her other work after watching what she did with Wonder Woman. There's definitely some carry over from Zack Snyder's style in the previous DCEU adventures, but I think Jenkins brought in some much needed humanity to this story. Just by looking at the tone of Wonder Woman you can see the clear difference between this and any of the 3 DCEU films. It more closely resembles the heart that Man of Steel brought to the table, but perhaps with a little less bleakness.The film does struggle a little with pacing in the first half, but it does surprisingly well developing characters. I hate to keep comparing it to other DC or Marvel films, but I would have a hard time thinking of a first superhero film (or Origin story) that did this well developing and writing characters. The supporting characters each had their own respected arcs and the relationship between Steve Trevor and Diana is truly something special. It reminded me a lot of Peggy and Steve's dynamic in The First Avenger, innocent and charming. The writing is so good, in fact, that it allowed me to forgive a lot of the late game CGI and green screen, because at that point I was already invested in all the characters.But even with all the action, laughs, and fun characters, it's all about the message. The power of love has been done over and over again in films, but it's rare that it is executed as well as it is here. We fall in love with Wonder Woman's innocence in the situation she's in, and she falls in love with human's drive to do what's right. It's a really powerful message and takes Wonder Woman to levels that I'm not sure most superhero films are able to match. So yes, the film is one of the best action films of the year, and certainly is up there on the all-time superhero list, but it's way more important than that.+Writing/directing+Gadot leads with charisma+Funny and heartwarming dynamic between Steve & Diana+Great action-Pacing a little slow in the beginning9.3/10","12 out of 30 found this helpful.

It has some cool action scenes, you can have some fun with it! Unfortunately you have to swallow some wrong background infos and a quite thin story line, though... ;)1) Why do the Germans have to be displayed as the single guilty party in WW1? That is very unfounded and shows no understanding of the real historic events at all. A very unidimensional black and white picture actually, they already are the WW2 bad guys anyway (which is justified). Of course the Germans were to blame for their part in WW1, but a lot of states were involved with questionable actions. For example the English were to blame, too! Historically it can be shown that the british interference really escalated the conflict to a global level, which would most likely have been much smaller otherwise, not ending as a world war! The Germans were pulled into the conflict because of an existing alliance with Austria/Hungary, while the English took part just by free choice (strategic interests). Later, as the winning party, they forced the side of Austria/Germany to take full responsibility, hiding their own faults.2) DC twisted around the greek mythology, quite randomly, just to fit the black and white super hero plot. E. g. Actually in the mythology Ares is said to be a kind of patron or ancestor of the amazons, not their enemy.But that aside, entertaining popcorn super hero cinema... Have fun! ;)","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

If they carried on making movies like this, DC would finally stand a chance against marvel. I'm not saying this is better than the marvel movies, because it isn't.

Kinda ten around one to three stars all in a row. All commenting how absurd it was that this movie was well rated, talking of it as rubbish and things like these, talking bad of DC superheroes and suggesting how little believable Wonder Woman was. Well, these all seem excuses to me. They really seem to have been paid to say something against the movie. You just cannot say something really bad about this. You cannot. You can not like it, of course, but said like this, well, this is an insult to intelligence! I never liked superheroes movies except ""Logan"" and the several Spiderman who have been produced over the last 15 years (I didn't watch the last one yet). But this, as well as the other superheroes movies I talked about, talks of humanity. You see people dying for some ideal. Action scenes are entertaining as you watch them with real passion. And Gal Gadot is a pleasure for the eyes. I couldn't stop from repeating to myself how beautiful and perfect for the part she is. Conclusion: go watch this movie to fall in love with this wonderful woman and humanity.

Firstly, the DCEU movies, though commercial successes, disappointed fans, movie lovers and critics alike and therefore the expectations were low. Secondly, all attempts of female lead superheros bombed, only look at ""Catwoman"" or ""Elektra"", which lowers these expectations even more. And finally Gal Gadot's critically seen casting also contributes to this argument.So the good movie and great performance Gal Gadot and her director Patty Jenkins are delivering, defies this expectations and everyone was very surprised. The movie was bright and colorful, funny, had character development and good chemistry between all of the characters. Also the action sequences were shot in a very different and interesting way. All points that proved that ""Wonder Woman"" is good. Gal Gadot, just to mention it, is absolutely perfect for this role.But why do I think this movie isn't great or deserves a rating of 9 or 10? Simply because I hated the final confrontation and god plot. Sorry for those who enjoy scenes like this, I find no enjoyment in gods stupidly fighting each other by destroying everything. I am tired of these endings. It seems that there are two options: sky beam or god like creatures. Both endings are stupid! Just watch the creative way ""Doctor Strange"" or ""Ant-Man"" handled their climax. More of this kind please! But after all this complaints, ""Wonder Woman"" is really good in many ways. Every detail in the first hour and a half fits and is a joy to watch. The ending is a bit weaker but still good.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

I had trouble understanding her mother's attitude - no, then yes, then no, etc, which was probably intended to heighten the mystery. And there are many hints here on the island that bear remembering later.Gal Gadot is captivating. She plays the new-to-the-outside-world role pretty well. But she really shines when Dianna has made up her mind and ready to act. I loved her look in London with the hat and glasses. And when she goes into action, she is one fierce lady. She is Wonder Woman. Even though so many of the action scenes were in the trailers, they still had impact when revealed on the big screen. And when she is on the screen, you just want to stare at her (face). (I say this as one not previously being at all attracted to Gadot.) Dianna is na√Øve, but not as much as you might expect - this is very well done. This movie is an excellent story of Dianna's journey to where she is in the present and explains what she said to Bruce Wayne at the end of the previous movie.Chris Pine is pretty much his usual self although maybe a little more serious and mature, but he really took a distant second place to Gadot.I was getting disappointed in the movie as it neared climax but then the whole thing changes and the climax is great and meaningful.I have a complaint about the unnecessary sexual tension and innuendo. The scene with Chris Pine getting out of the bath is silly and clich√©. Likewise the boat scene, although not quite so clich√©.","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

When a pilot on the run (Chris Pine) crashes near their island paradise and tells of conflict in the outside world, she leaves home to fight a war to end all wars. Yes, another superhero movie, and the titular heroine is not a minor one. WW made her first comics appearance in October 1941 and has been in publication almost continuously after that. Constant reader has probably noticed that superhero movies are not my cup of tea, mostly because of lack of originality. So many of them are origin stories, like we really cared about how they came about. So many are shamelessly copying each other on grassroots level, especially 2001's ¬ÑIron Man"" which established a blueprint that no one wants to deviate from. And I'm especially tired of big fights which are always consisting of flying through air and punching each other, destroying stuff in the process, including houses. How many times do I have to watch the same f*cking thing, year after year? Having said that, I actually quite like the ¬ÑWonder Woman"" movie. It looks really good, old-fashioned in a good way, and the two leading stars are charming. Chris Pine is effective as the new Indiana Jones era Harrison Ford the world has been waiting for. But most of the attention and praise goes to Gal Gadot as Diana. She's just wonderful indeed: beautiful, in good ass-kicking shape and also good at displaying subtle sense of humor which goes long way when the Amazon princess has to meet the modern world (during the World War I). My biggest concern is the quite lenghty final chapter of the story where the bad guy comes into play. In this part of the movie one can't deny anymore that the main character's philosophy is shallow and underdeveloped even by the standards of Facebook Deep we live in. And the final battle is, of course, as generic as they come in modern superhero movies, consisting mostly flying through air and punching each other, destroying stuff in the process. Remember how Charlize Theron got an Oscar for 2003's ¬ÑMonster""? This is actually the director Patty Jenkins's first movie job after that, in the meantime she has done mostly TV and this one anthology. Welcome back, great job!","0 out of 8 found this helpful.

It is a movie with a good romantic rapport by Gadot and Pine, a solid secondary cast and a dramatic idea contained in Allan Heinberg's script. Patty Jenkins rises above the pressure and brings a solid, interesting and humorous story to life. As Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot is perfect and ideal for this role. The only bad thing in this movie is that there are too many villains, none of them dramatically strong enough to be much of a threat, and the most interesting characters get killed off too soon.

"6","/10","A superhero disappointment","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4556642/?ref_=tt_urv","MihaiSorinToma","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur16488747/?ref_=tt_urv","2 January 2019","After a Nazi plane crashes near the land of the Amazons and the pilot is saved by a young warrior wannabe, they venture into the middle of the World War in her attempt to kill Ares, the god of war whom she thought was responsible for everything. Young Diana will soon find out that the outer world is much different than hers and as nothing is as simple as they seem, a journey of self-discovery but also self-education will be taken in parallel with the one of mankind's salvation.We follow the story of Diana since she was a little child as she aspired to fight together with the girls from her land and her evolution to Wonder Woman, although this name isn't used even a single time. The story is unfortunately average or even below average. It manages to tell a pertinent and interesting story but lacks complexity. It's way too linear and predictable for my taste, almost every single problem being solved with the blink of an eye. It lacks drama and emotion and although it has a few moments of romance, they are also unable to do much. What you do get is a lot of spectacular action which is impressive and thrilling but until it also becomes predictable. It is worth mentioning that they've taken a serious approach regarding this movie, or at least this is the impression that the movie tried to leave, but the characters are not quite helping in this direction.Speaking of characters, they are also not very well thought or might be too well thought, it's quite hard to tell, but what I can tell for sure is that they are not very likeable, credible or even well developed and described. The best one I find it to be Chris Pine's as he manages to be much more credible and less annoying than Gal Gadot's childish and immature one. Another black ball here would be that she insists on keeping it like this way until the end when she suddenly decides to grow up and do something worthy of her status. Not to mention the ""squad"" that joins them in their quest and they do almost nothing useful along the way. I don't want to bring spoilers here so that's all that I will say.In terms of visuals everything looks good but nothing spectacular. I liked the way the fighting scenes are filmed and presented, with the surreal angles used, but unfortunately there isn't much to be impressed here. One or two explosions now and then, a slow-motion bullet dodged or blocked and that's about it. I'm not saying that it's a bad thing, especially as it works for the movie in terms of seriousness but I felt that the highly CGI-ed final fight was left there alone, like it didn't belong to the picture.To sum things up, I have to say that I'm disappointed by this movie, especially as the hype that surrounded it made me have high expectations. Even if it weren't for them, the movie would still have felt average. I like this type of superhero movies but you have to have a good story to make it all work. You also have to create great characters and as I mentioned before, Chris' was the only one worth mentioning, or better said, the only one worth empathizing with. It's a shame that they weren't able to do more with the material that they had. And to make things clear, this review is coming from a superhero movie lover, not a Marvel fan or a DC Comics hater.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A real step-up for DC, for me. Investing characters carried me through some minor problems.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3729088/?ref_=tt_urv","OlieRendch","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur28985407/?ref_=tt_urv","10 June 2017","So here we are, back in the DC Cinematic Universe that, so far, hasn't been greatly received but maybe that's all about to change. Wonder Woman stars Gal Gadot as the titular character and also boasts the cast of Chris Pine, Danny Huston, Connie Nielson, and Robin Wright. These all do great in the film but by far, Gal and Chris steal the show, their chemistry, interactions, and characters are a real joy to watch. Gal Gadot's Diana is such an interesting character as this powerful, but naive Amazon woman experiencing early 20th century Europe. She conveys strength, humor, and emotion really well and looks great in the action scenes. Chris Pine is classic Chris Pine which is a bonus to any movie whether it's a science-fiction space franchise or a Lindsy Lohan chick flick, and so here in Wonder Woman, he delivers another entertaining character in Steve Trevor.The other cast include Steve's group of merry men he must team up with and I have to say I enjoyed them quite a bit, they each had a distinct personality and even their own little personal battles to deal with. On the villain front, I can't say much because of spoilers but I really enjoyed Danny Huston and Elana Anaya's evil duo, they reminded me a lot of classic 60s villains for some reason. And this movie does that a few times, it gives you the sense of classic movies, whether it's the nods to 1970s Superman or just the slowed down nature of the plot, Wonder Woman just felt familiar and comfortable.Plot-wise, as I say, had quieter moments and they didn't pack it full of action which made a nice change to the usual format; it really mad us feel for these characters and care when things happen. The beginning had a bit of an unsteady pace and the climax was a bit generic CGI battle but because the characters were so investing I didn't mind as much. And just seeing the aesthetic of ancient Greek culture mixing with World War I was an interesting visual in itself.In the end, I feel Wonder Woman is a real step-up for DC, whether it was the director, Patty Jenkins, the writers or a mix of a few things. The film isn't perfect but I'd be lying if I said I did not enjoy it.","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

Yes. Is it a revolutionary masterpiece that all the reviews are making it out to be? HELL NO. ""Wonder Woman"" is directed by Patty Jenkins, who previously directed a vastly different looking Charlize Theron in the fantastic drama ""Monster"", which most believe to be Theron's best performance, and well, if there is one huge thing to say about ""Wonder Woman"", it is that Gal Gadot is pretty good as the red, white, and blue lead, which comes as a huge surprise seeing that most people consider Gadot to be a very weak actress, which there most certainly is a case for, BUT she is triumphant as our main lead. Chris Pine, who plays our main heroine's love interest is also pretty good here, both bringing charisma and a bevy laughs. The first thing you'll notice about the movie is how beautiful it looks when it comes to the glorious production and costume design. So now, let's get into the negatives that people seem to be disregarding. The film had me worried that it wouldn't be as good as people have suggested when the film starts with narration (of course) in the present(?) for some reason because, you know, Warner Bros. needs to let you know that this film is apart of a cinematic universe, I mean, it's not too bad but it really wasn't needed, then we head off to the island of the Amazonians, which looks beautiful but everything in it just falls sort of flat, we are introduced to our young Diana, who is very funny in parts but the kid's acting is just not good AT ALL, which is sometimes expected with kid actors. The cgi in this movie is just plain BAD, that plus the overuse of slo mo somewhat taints some pretty good action scenes, you can definitely tell that Patty Jenkins is a first time director in the superhero genre, (although plenty of directors don't fall into that trap like Nolan, Raimi, Singer) once we head off to London the film gets much better, it becomes a pretty good war film, it's the first time we've seen war portrayed, you know, LIKE WAR in a superhero movie, (sorry Cap) but as I said the great action scenes are tainted by bad visuals, an overabundance of slo mo, and hero shots up the wazoo. Now let's talk about the villains, the villains as expected here are absolutely terrible, just downright cartoonish, and once again we get a big cgi, explosion filled finale that gave me flashes of ""Batman v. Superman"". (although nowhere near as bad as that) Now does that sound like a revolutionary masterpiece to you? If so, see more movies immediately.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Obligatory slow motion action followed by stylistic cinematography and a booming theme tune to pack. It's a shame that it couldn't quite capture the wonderment that I was expecting. Chronicling the origin story of the titular superhero as she ventures into the world of man to stop Ares from destroying everyone and everything. Gone are the days of female objectification, director Jenkins made sure of that. It's all about female empowerment and how the Amazons do not require the dependencies of men to live a luxurious lifestyle. The narrative frequently shifts between the colossal scope of warfare, where most of the action resides, and Diana's naivety as she encounters various objects, procedures and locations that differ from her own world. Her fearless approach to everything unknown, regardless of the consequences, allowed a small amount of humour and natural personality to be injected into this epic story. Amidst the chaos is a subtle romance between a spy who crash lands in Thermyscira and Diana herself. Whilst this enables an emotional resonance with the plot, it slightly hinders her empowering character during specific scenes. However her overall development was adequate. Gadot possesses the physicality and innocence of the titular hero, but lacks both bodily and facial expressiveness. The rest of the supporting cast were good, although Thewlis was terribly miscast. Most of the film's issues arise during the rushed final act that succumbs to horrendous visual effects, green screen and underdeveloped plot points, unfortunately taking you out of the film. And yet again, human CGI still seems to be an inherent issue within these blockbusting franchises. Just damn awful at times. Atleast the fight choreography was clean and succinct, especially those sliding tackles. This leads Wonder Woman to be a decent stylistic superhero flick that sadly doesn't stand out within the saturated genre.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's something often forgotten in the DC comics, because unlike marvel, it centers on the heroic part. That's the reason, DC characters, are so much better in TV series than they are in their drawn version or in their cinematic version. In the extended TV versions, there's no choice but to develop the personal life - the human part of the super heroes. Yes I know it's an over simplified generalization, but as a rule that's the main difference between Marvel's superheroes, and the DC ones, except Batman, where the line between the hero and the human is all but nonexistent. And that's why Batman movies did work better than any other DC movies we know about. Yes, there's another short lived exception to this rule that is the first two movies of Christopher Reeve's Superman, where they managed to counter the pomposity with the right amount of campiness. It was a very fine balance, and a very hard one to maintain. It took some very fine acting and a very careful script, and they half lost it by the 3rd one, not to mention the 4th.So here we have a first human DC superhero, in a long while. And it's a combined effort. Gal Gadot is mostly great, but she's still a rookie, and does have two or three off moments, during the film, so here comes the director and the editing, not to mention the other stellar cast, they all cover for her, making sure the movie stays true. Making sure that all the melodrama, is balanced, some jokes at the right moment also help, but the truth is that the humor is very limited. Compare it with most of Marvel's productions and you'll see I'm right. It's simply more humorous than recent DC movies, but that's easy. It's once again a fine balance kept by a combined effort of the entire production.And here I return to my title. Why do I say Gal Gadot is great despite her few off moments during the film. Because she delivers the most superficial pompous slogans with such conviction, you don't really feel how banal they were, until you rethink the whole thing. Not many veterans of the trade can get away with it, she does. All she still has to do is polish her act a bit more and she'll be one of the best","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

At best she was Superman with breasts - at worse, she was also Superman with breasts.When Gal Gadot was announced as the next WW, my first instinct was indifference, then when I saw her in BvS I regretted the occasion to have a real colossal woman to play the role, you know, with muscles and breasts. But with this movie I warmed up to Gadot, who plays her role without a shadow of arrogance, and that marvellous voice of her. Her presence, along with DC/Snyder having cleared a bit the mess that was her origins, was one of the good things about this movie.Another one was to set said origins in a WWI setting, less overdone than the WWII one, but, alas, they couldn't do better than create ""WWI nazis"" to make Germans the bad guys again instead of the would-be victims of an ancient deity's manipulations. The plight of English soldiers is, it seem, easy to empathize when compared to the Germans' treatment as half-animals. Was that another Kosher Hollywood swipe at Germany?And since we're there, did we really need another American in the de facto lead role? How come he was calling the shots in an English setting? Are we to the point where the US public couldn't care less about a movie if the main hero isn't a Yank, even if the action takes place in medieval times, for exemple? That being said Chris Pine did a great job, a bit at the expense of the titular character, and he was certainly more memorable than the other sidekicks.Another good point were the action scenes, where DC is finally getting on par with Marvel in this rather important part of a super-hero flick, except that they are rather one-sided and have this irritating ""bullet time"" slo-mo switch that passes off as ""super-speed"". This was counter-balanced by the rather poor scenario, where everything is telegraphed miles in advances. Humor is subtle. Photo and music is okay.In conclusion, this movie is part of DC's getting up to Marvel's incontested cinematographic supremacy (along with BvS), against pretty much all odds as predicted disasters were common in the elaboration of a WW franchise. But here, it's clearly a step in the right direction.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Directed with a deft hand by Patty Jenkins, the film is a tapestry of mythic grandeur and human intimacy, a rare balance in a genre often tilted towards the former.Gal Gadot's portrayal of Diana is a triumph of casting. She embodies the Amazonian warrior with a blend of regal confidence and naive curiosity that is both endearing and inspiring. Her journey from the idyllic shores of her homeland to the war-torn landscapes of World War I is crafted with care, allowing the audience to witness the birth of a hero not just in strength but in spirit.The narrative, while familiar in its beats, is elevated by its central performance and the chemistry between Gadot and Chris Pine, who plays the charming spy Steve Trevor. Their dynamic provides the film with a heartwarming core, and their interactions range from comedic to poignant, offering a human scale to the larger-than-life proceedings.Jenkins' direction shines particularly in the action sequences, which are both thrilling and coherent. The battle on the beaches of Themyscira is a standout, showcasing the prowess of the Amazons in a sequence that is both visually stunning and emotionally charged. The film's commitment to showcasing its heroines as formidable warriors is commendable and refreshing.The third act succumbs to the genre's penchant for bombastic spectacle, somewhat diminishing the nuanced build-up. The final confrontation with Ares, the god of war, feels like a concession to genre expectations rather than a culmination of the film's thematic journey.The film's pacing occasionally falters, particularly in the middle section where Diana's exploration of the human world, though charming, slows the momentum. The supporting cast, while capable, is underutilized, with characters like the spirited Etta Candy deserving more screen time.The film's visual effects are a mixed bag. While the recreation of Themyscira is breathtaking, some of the CGI in later battles feels incongruous with the film's otherwise tangible world. This inconsistency can be jarring and detracts from the immersion.""Wonder Woman"" stands as a significant entry in the superhero genre. It succeeds more than it stumbles, offering a vision of heroism that is as much about compassion and understanding as it is about physical might.

What most post-man of steel movies did wrong was: character development. It was a crucial, but missing part. Until now.The beginning explains in greater detail what the Amazonians do, their history and how Diana grew up.It's a great mix of character development and action scenes with some interesting plot twists. The soundtrack is amazing and the main theme is introduced at the right time. Great looking cast with decent acting.TL;DR: the second best (after man of steel) DC movie so far.

The pacing of the story is near perfection. I'd been sitting in the theater for almost two hours and the story was still enjoyable and not that dragging, thanks to the amazing combination of properly delivered punchlines, awesome fight scenes that featured strong independent woman throwing enormous grown men firing machine guns, and those not-so-cheesy- but-can-still-be-considered-romantic moments. Transitions from one scene to another is not confusing and done properly this time relatively to their previous DCEU movies (ehem BvS). CGI is not perfect but still tolerable, those fight scenes were good enough to cover the CGI's imperfections. The ending is kind of clich√© and predictable but the overall plot is still great, simple yet enjoyable. (I still have a few questions about the plot but let's save that for the future)Contrary to popular belief a movie featuring Wonder Woman (or any super heroine) can actually be successful, interesting and empowering (not just for women). This is the pivotal movie for the entire DCEU and the DC movie we've been waiting for!","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

After flops like The Green Lantern and Batman and Superman, it was refreshing to see the studio produce a good plot with a likable protagonist. However, I couldn't help but feel like I had seen this all before.The similarities to Marvel's Captain America are startling. Both occur during one of the World Wars, following a ""Super Soldier"" and their band of misfit soldiers as they combat the deeper evil that is really behind all of the conflict. Watching Wonder Woman do stunts that we saw Steve Rogers doing in 2011 can pull the viewer out of the experience of the movie.After watching Wonder Woman, I am left with multiple unanswered questions. One of the first scenes that we get a taste of Wonder Woman's power is in a training session early in the movie. When she defends herself using her braces, a massive shock wave is emitted, knocking her opponent in the air. We never get an explanation of how she activates said power, and it is never again used in the movie, despite multiple instances where it would be extremely useful.All in all, Wonder Woman is an improvement overall from the past experiences we have all had with DC movies. Though entertaining and visually appealing, clich√©s and plot holes leave the viewer slightly dissatisfied.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Detective Comics first modern-day take on a classic superhero character: Wonder Woman. For those of us of a certain vintage, the phrase ""Wonder Woman"" conjures up images of Lynda Carter saving 1970's America in her star- spangled costume and satin tights. For teenage boys everywhere she was Wonder Woman made flesh.DC Comics have ventured into solo female superhero movie territory before with poor results. We had 1984's ill-conceived Supergirl with Helen Slater and 2004's critically- panned CatWoman with Halle Berry. Even Marvel, who can do no wrong these days have had their fair share of solo female super-hero disasters: Elektra anyone? And so DC, having faced critical and fan-based scorn for 2016's Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad, dip their toe into the superhero waters once more. To say there is a lot riding on the success of Wonder Woman is a truism. It's the next test for DC and it's in a genre with a poor track record: single female superhero movies.Director Patty Jenkins has an excellent track record with 2003's Monster being one of my stand-out favourites. It also has the honour of earning Charlize Theron her first Oscar (Best Actress in a Leading Role). So we know Jenkins can tell a story. As with all origin superhero films, we have to have the back-story together with an ""it's all up there on the screen"" action sequence in Act III. Israel's Gal Gadot appeared as Wonder Woman in last year's Batman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice. Her performance in that was one of the stand-out moments of an otherwise dull movie. So hopes are high that she can carry a feature-length movie on her own. The good news is that she can. Supporting her and providing the love interest is Capt. Kirk himself, Chris Pine as Major Steve Trevor.In terms of story we have the obligatory origin-story. We discover that before she was Wonder Woman, she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, raised on a sheltered island paradise and trained to be an unconquerable warrior. The island has been hidden from the world by Zeus but when a pilot crashes on the island's shores and tells of a massive conflict raging in the outside world, Diana leaves her home, convinced she can stop the threat. All of this happens in Act I and we get performances from Robin Wright as her trainer. We are also introduced to one of the villains of the piece, Ludendorf played with scenery-chewing aplomb by Danny Huston.In Act II our heroine is brought to London, to the heart of the Allied war effort. IN this Pygmaleon-esque sequence we see Diana being introduced to society. Most of the film's humour resides in this Act and it is a delight. Gal Gadot shows her acting chops and comic timing and proves a good foil for Chris Pine. Lucy Davis shines as the female role-adviser and hapless carrier of the sword! Diana and Steve decide to go to ""the front"" and try to stop the development or release of a new German weapon. More comedy ensues as they recruit the team they need.Once we get to the front, the tone changes. We witness through Diana's eyes and her experiences, the true horror of war: not just on the soldiers but on the towns and families caught up in the war. In typical hero's-journey pacing, it is a real road of trials for Wonder Woman. Her experiences, her apotheosis in Act II set up our hero for the final showdown in Act III. As is required by modern-superhero story-telling, there is an epic final battle. That's where we leave the narrative for fear of spoilers.This film's strength is in it's heart and Jenkins has proved herself a master of telling stories that resonate with audiences. She never allows the film to lose that heart and it is a better movie for it. It's not without it's flaws. In particular, Act I, on the island is scattered and at times disorientating. A minor quibble in an otherwise good origin story.Gal Gadot is simply outstanding. Her range in this film shows she is capable of more. She is slated to reprise Wonder Woman in DC's Justice League due later this year. For now, as Princess of the Amazonians, she rules all before her.A solid 4 out of 5","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

In the following I will reference itemized aspects of the film and give an individual score (on a 1-10 form) for each.DialogueThe dialogue was cheesy at moments, however, maintained emotion through a majority of it. This cheesy nature normally occurs during attempted one-liners during battle. These phrases ended up sounding much worse than how they were attended to sound. Other than those few moments, the dialogue kept emotion vivid and was convincing. Overall ""Writing"" score: 7/10ActingThe acting was superb. This to be expected with such a large budget being available for casting. The delivery was smooth and convincing. My only critique is that the delivery was sometimes overdramatic. This added to a further cheesy quality about some parts of the film. Overall ""Acting"" score: 9/10CinematographyThe shots were very bland. Focus, lighting and tracking was good but at the sacrifice of originality. There was slow-motion panning, quick panning, and quick cutting. It is pretty standard for this style of production. Overall ""Cinematography"" score: 7/10PlotThe plot was very expository. Such was a focus and its primary objective. However, there was a bit of conflict in the end which acted as a slight motivation. That conflict, though, was quickly obliterated to finish the movie with the protagonist achieving utter victory -- leaving no intensity. There was little tension throughout due to the ultimate power of Wonder Woman and the relative weakness of literally everyone else (other than the aforementioned final boss. Overall ""Plot"" score: 6/10ConclusionIt was a good movie. Certainly when compared to previous ""DC"" endeavors. Quality film with some cheesy bits and quick pacing. Overall score: 29/40","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Their contributions make this the first of many entries into a profitable future film series. Gal Gadot play Princess Diana, daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta, and she is perfectly cast as our Amazon warrior. She is terrific in this role. The Israeli actress has star power personified and she also displays some nice comic timing too. Patty Jenkins, her director, does a remarkable job of focusing on the human story while staging the action sequence with real flair. She does not sacrifice the hand-to-hand combat expected in this type of movie and plays up the relationship between the goddess and the mortal.That mortal is Steve Trevor, played winningly by Chris Pine. This charming actor can play the dashing hero and WWI aviator without much challenge, but he brings along with him a sweet vulnerability and slight goofiness that makes his character endearing. The chemistry between him and Ms. Gadot, dare I say, makes this film work wonders and elevates it above the rest of the stereotypical DC or Marvel universe of superheroes.The screenplay by Allan Heinberg establishes the action scenes amid more quieter moments that fortify the relationship of the mismatched lovers. It creates a strong role model and allows Diana to play the role of a stranger in a strange land, that place being WWI Germany. As she comes to terms with the cruelty of war and mankind's choices to perpetuate this violence, the film makes its heavy-handed message, at least, more intriguing. Unfortunately Wonder Woman's golden lariat can break free of the standard formula of the comic book superhero genre, beginning with the mythological origins of our heroine and ending in a typical slam-bang showdown of overproduced CGI. Fortunately, in between, is that tender love story that ropes in the moviegoer's interest.Supporting characters never achieve much depth. The bad guys are so obvious (even a twist here and there, lacked an element of surprise). The good guys are stock misfits that aren't given much to do. Still, Danny Huston, Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright, David Thewlis and Lucy Davis bring some needed class to the movie. Ms. Jenkins has created a well crafted film and, unlike so many of the recent action flicks, stages the battle scenes clearly. Thankfully, there is little upfront close-ups and jittery camera moves. (Credit goes to cinematographer Matthew Jensen as well.) One can actually see the action, a rarity with action-fantasy blockbusters these days. Especially effective is her vision of Diana's war in No-Man's Land set piece, the film's highlight. (Although it seems more realistic to conclude that Diana's form-fitting WW outfit and bare skin may have unified the Allied forces more than her warrior skills leading them to victory.) entertainsWonder Woman may not be very original or ground-breaking, but it does enable women to take the reins in the usually all-male dominating world of filmmaking and deliver one of the better comic book superhero blockbuster in quite a long time. Hear them roar!","5 out of 10 found this helpful.

This movie is a good example of how not to make superhero origin movies. We'll probably forget it for a good reason after the studios make big money out of it. I love superhero origin movies. I feel this one might have worked well in an age void of the Batman or Ironman or Spiderman origin stories or even Thor for the heck of it. Well maybe not even then. Those characters did actually look and feel like superheroes you could relate with and they looked real. Imagine Ironman without Robert Downey Jr or Batman without Christian Bale. Nope, DC went down the first time with Man of Steel. And Now This.You have a Wonder Woman played by Gal Gadot who doesn't even look like she remotely has anything to do with Amazon except maybe the Wood on her face along with the rest of her clan. I get all the glitz and glamour with her costumes and makeup. But if they wanted to do that they should have done a modeling gig or a cosplay shootout and not a movie. And the chemistry between her and Chris Pine is like mixing milk with vinegar, completely forced and unnecessary making the movie curdle up in your face. Even the villain is such a major let down. What's left is a predictable plot with monotonous characters acted by human cutouts headed by a director who slept well through her job.Costumes and sets are great and cinematography looked fine too but even the fight scenes are boring and atrocious to watch as they lack realism or visual bravado. This all accompanied by the jarring sound track every-time Wonder Woman shows up makes it all the more pretentious towards the audience. Maybe it was the one thing could've saved this movie just like it did in Batman vs Superman. It was unoriginal but somewhat managed to redeem the previous movie only to prove they can't do it every-time. This movie is at best a commercial marketing gimmick and at worst a complete waste of senses I wished I had the luxury of leaving behind in a heap of thrash notwithstanding the constant bombardment of hype by the media regarding how people are raving about it. Sorry I don't get it at all. I'd rather watch reruns of Deadpool then revisit this again ever.","22 out of 48 found this helpful.

For my money the best scene comes early and it's a battle scene where the Amazons take on WW1 Germans. Thing is that scene includes some of the most beautiful imaginations of women in battle I've ever seen. That took actors able to place their bodies in some very athletic positions. The last time I saw something comparable was with Brad Pitt in Troy when he takes on some Trojan champion.Gal Gadot doesn't really share in that wonderful first battle scene, but she's so captivating and right for the part, it's a pleasure to see her carry on in the rest of it. Women aren't easy to portray as warriors but this movie manages to pull it off. And that's doubly impressive since the director's a woman.The movie does lose a little of its magic near the end, but is well worth your time.","9 out of 22 found this helpful.

Gal Gadot showed her brilliant ability to be fierce, strong, & tough & at the same time, sweet, lovable, & kind. Chris Pine was excellent as her first & only love interest, Steve Trevor. One of the things that surprised me most was how thoroughly awesome & bad-ass Robin Wright was as Antiope. The rest of the cast were perfect for their roles & last but not least, Patty Jenkins proved without a doubt what a superb director she is. I can't wait to see what she will bring to the table next! I loved it so much that I know I will be seeing Wonder Woman multiple times at the theater during its hopefully very long run!

Although I didn't come out of the theater jumping in excitement, the more time I spent thinking about Wonder Woman, the more I respected and appreciated it. It grew on me *after* watching it, as I had more and more time to think about it and realize what a masterpiece it is. The movie breaks numerous boundaries for both superhero movies and for movies in general. I'm not one for deep analysis; I go to the movies for one thing only: to be entertained. This movie literally had ONE boring scene in it, and that is the bar scene where they chat (great time for restroom break.) Other than that, it was action-packed, humorous, and amazingly directed. The first half of the movie is about Diana of Themyscira and how she came to be, as well as setup for the second half. One of my favorite scenes from any movie of all time takes place here, when the Amazonians defend their land from the Germans (not a spoiler, don't worry.) Then comes the second half, where it gets action-PACKED. Amazing fight scenes, *wonder*ful music, and I don't usually say this, but brilliantly written. I found myself almost crying at some parts, and stifling laughter in others. The actors, cinematographers, visual effects team, and director all did a superb job and they are the real heroes here. This was an amazing movie, take my word for it, and if you like anything I mentioned above, you'll enjoy Wonder Woman.","9 out of 22 found this helpful.

I rarely mark a film with a single star but this seems to have no redeeming features whatsoever. This film was a phenomenal disappointment. Im a big fan of the superhero genre and was hoping this was going to be a great addition - especially as there is a great need for a strong female lead. Unfortunately this film fails at every level. Even the special/visual effects were a let down.Coming as a spin-off from The Batman v Superman film and leading us into the Justice League franchise I expected a mature direction. However this seems to be aimed at the socially awkward 'Twilight' generation of angst ridden teenagers! Both Gadot and Pine were wasted here. The dialogue and screenplay were sub-par and cringy. I have no experience writing either and while i may struggle to compose any kind of screenplay, I'm certain I could vastly improve the dialogue and character interaction. Even the direction seemed lacklustre and awry. I've no idea how they could get so many elements wrong without getting any right - even the law of averages seems to have failed here!Quite simply: AVOID","28 out of 64 found this helpful.

I thought it was going to be terrible like previous DCEU movies, but I was very glad when I saw that it was far from that. ""Wonder Woman"" is a fantastic film with some fantastic moments... Nevertheless, it's not flawless.Acting is fantastic. The role of Diana fits Gal Gadot perfectly and the rest of the cast is also very good. Even people who aren't given much screen time (Robin Wright, Connie Nielsen, Lucy Davis) shine in their roles. Patty Jenkins directs the movie marvelously; all elements seem in the right balance and, unlike previous DCEU films, this one doesn't favor style over substance: It keeps both in just the right amount. The editing is fantastic. Visual effects are enjoyable, though not great. Costumes are incredible (particularly Wonder Woman's, needless to say). The score is brilliant... Almost everything is good.Keyword: Almost. I have only two problems with this film: One is that it has some moments that feel too far-fetched, even considering the rules of this fictional world. You see those moments and go ""Oh, come on, that can't happen"". The other problem and the one that bothered me the most is that the film is a little too formulaic. It's just another superhero origin story. At least Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad, as awful as they were, had something in their favor: Originality. The concepts were unlike anything we'd seen before. ""Wonder Woman"" decides not to take that risk and to stick to your normal superhero origin story recipe: An unwilling hero unaware of her true powers, a love story, an unexpected villain, the hero learning to live with her abilities... Nothing new.In the end of the day, even though ""Wonder Woman"" isn't great, it certainly is a fantastic and enjoyable experience, one that gives me faith that the DCEU is not doomed like we thought it was.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

I'm neither, and will rate this film on its own merits.I gave it an 8/10 mainly because of the amazing chemistry between the two leads and how well they played their characters - Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. These two are what held this film together. The rest of the characters I found a little stale, unconvincing and boring.The action and VFX was a little overboard in my opinion - too much CGI.The writing had some obvious plot holes but was made up for in the directing, which I found to be excellent.So it's an 8/10 from me.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

In fact, it's the best superhero origin story since Iron Man. Even though Marvel has given us the masterpiece that is Logan (technically, it's Fox. but hey, it's still Marvel to me), the awesome mix that is GotG2, and maybe the unexpectedly great Thor: Ragnarok and Spiderman: Homecoming this year, You've gotta give at least a chance for DC to proof itself, and this year, they made it. DC won this year, period.Pros: Gal Gadot owned the character! She's very good in this movie. I like how she's not comfortable during the city scene. She also brings a sense of humanity to the character, which is also a plus. Chris Pine is great as Steve Trevor. The rest of the cast also gives their best performances, especially the character of Charlie, Chief and the German general guy. The relationship between Diana and Steve, my god it's heartwarming.The script is great. Not the best, but certainly not the worst. Zack Snyder proofs himself that he IS a good writer (as long as he's away from the typical somber/sad tone in literary every DC movie (execpt The Dark Knight trilogy)). It can be cheesy sometimes, but it doesn't matter, it don't affect the movie much. The script is, surprisingly hits a emotional tone as well. It's unbelievably sad and it's definitely a plus for the movie. Oh, and the movie's more lighthearted, much like Marvel, and that I definitely appreciate it. The action scenes were great as usual. A mix of practical and CGI which blended perfectly. The final fight is a CGI fest, which is cheesy yet glorious at the same time. Thankfully, the producers realize their mistakes in BvS, and as the result, the fight didn't went as bad as BvS. Oh, and I already tell that the music is eargasmic?Cons: A typical problem in every superhero movie: Plot holes, bad CGI, and a weak villain. Otherwise, I don't see a flaw in this movieOverall, Wonder Woman exceeds all expectations, and proofing that DC can be as good as Marvel. Beautifully shot, well acted, great writing, awesome action sequences, and well directed, Wonder Woman is definitely worth your time, and it is DC's best since The Dark Knight.Congratulations DCEU you've striked a homer. Sincrely, from a MCU fan*did I also tell you that Gal Gadot is freakin beautiful?","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

The film shows Wonder Woman, an Amazon who wants to stop the Great War between mankind, and on the way she witnesses the true mankind, along with the sheer horror of war. The first twenty minutes are a bit uneven as they introduce Wonder Woman and the island she was born on, and as they witness mankind approach them, but after all that the film is completely steady and knows when to pull the heart- strings, and the emotion is never forced or sentimental, but pure truthful. That's what makes this film so good, is that we see the war and we see Wonder Woman's heart-ache as she watches people die right before her, and we feel her heart-ache as well while Wonder Woman wonders, ""Why don't we do more?"" I don't think this film deserves 10/10 because the film's first twenty minutes was uneven, like I said before, and that there was a bit too much CGI in the action sequences. Despite that, this film succeeds in style and substance as we watch her in slow-motion defeating the opponents like the warrior she is. You can definitely tell that this film was directed by Patty Jenkins, as this film is subtly talented behind all those action sequences we watch. The action sequences are a bit extreme, yes. But if you look beyond those action sequences, you see a good film, one that will be remembered for the years to come. In the future, you'll talk about how you saw this film, and how it was like to witness it at the cinema. It's really that good.But, of course, the film has it's cons, which I stated before. The reason why I'm stating this again is because the cons may get in the way of your viewing experience and disrupt the good. I don't want that to happen. If you can look away from those cons that stick out like a sore thumb, you'll absolutely love it, but those cons may just be a sharp stab in the back for the less tolerable. If you are completely difficult to satisfy when it comes to film, then I recommend not watching this. Otherwise, I'm sure you'll have a blast and a thought-provoking experience at the same time as we watch moral and the true meaning of human. 8.2/10.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

Worse is that some newspapers reviewers also rated this movie as very good which is how you know they have been paid or that they are desperate to be politically correct! Wonder Woman is full of nonsense, first of all why is the story set in WW 1 instead of the dark ages where it's outfit belongs ? Well, probably because the producers went to Israel to find a woman who can play this character , they could not find one in USA or Europe !? Why did they go to Israel for this woman (who cannot act or speak English)? Maybe because the action of the movie was set in WW1 and a Jewish woman fighting the Germans would be a symbolic message! But Hollywood did not stop there with the symbolism, they used a real life German general name in this fictional movie: Ludendorff - a real German World War I general. They could have made up a name but Hollywood wanted to send a message!Why not use the name Hitler since Hitler was a soldier in WW1 just like Ludendorff ! In fact General Ludendorff joined the NAZI party and helped Hitler get into power in Germany. The Israeli Gal Gadot kills this future NAZI general in the movie, see where this goes ? The movie if full of symbolism and metaphors! A superhero movie should be placed in a SF universe, like Batman's city, not in actual human history where it changes it for the benefit of the American propaganda machine that Hollywood is !And we did not even talk about the FEMINIST message in this movie, that's a totally different story.The movie is Directed by a woman and is intended to be a big FEMINIST propaganda shock story aimed at teenagers. The feminist propaganda did not start today but now Hollywood makes FEMINIST movies on a scale not seen before. There are many new feminist characters being prepared in their propaganda laboratories. In 2017 you have 'Proud Mary' which is a FEMINIST movies for black women, then there is 'Atomic Blonde' for white women. Last year we had 'Ghostbusters' with women and so many others. Over the years there were countless feminist movies in which women played Rambo style characters: Salt, Resident Evil, Electra, Tomb Raider etc yet somehow a lot of people discover the woman superhero just today! Really ?It's like there is a contest with men, even if it looks unreal Hollywood wants to portray women capable of the same physical capabilities as men even though everybody knows this is not possible since normal women are not physically as strong as menMr & Mrs Smith was a feminist movie since the woman in that movie was meant to be as strong and capable as the man but at least we could enjoy that one because the acting was good and the script was OK, in Wonder Woman the script and the acting are garbageWonder Woman (2016) is a disaster of a movie but a great tool for the army of feminist propagandists out there","21 out of 46 found this helpful.

Gal Gadot is one of the most strikingly beautiful actresses ever, when she's giving that head tilted down look to Pine in the hotel it's lights out. Maybe in part because of that (but only in part) she has chunks of what is known as screen presence, and she has it real big time. I wouldn't have guessed they would pick the end days of WWI for Wonder Woman's solo premier but it was all done right. Good pacing to the movie, maybe had 10 minutes more than they needed and a few of the things that happened didn't entirely make sense, but as an up close intro movie to the brunette Amazon she and it were a knockout.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

I have watched the Avengers, Winter Soldier and Civil War. Last year my friend had gone to Batman vs Superman without inviting me and I was so glad! This year I was expecting Wonder Woman to fail miserably. But as the movie opened critics started pouring positive reviews. So I decided to take my friend to Wonder Woman and it easily became my favorite Superhero movie (The Dark Knight series not considered). I would say it is slightly better than Winter Soldier which is my favorite MCU movie.The reason is simple. Unlike normal movies which focus on elevating and glorifying the character of the Superhero, Wonder Woman takes the audience and herself along a journey that eventually leads to her self-realization. The film has a smooth flow compared to other Superhero movies and the acting is brilliant. The concept of Gods and Humans, was in my opinion properly defined in this movie. As a lover of Greek mythology I understood the charterers Diana and Ares. Except the last action packed CGI battle of Wonder Woman and Ares, this film is perfect. Another reason that Wonder Woman differentiates itself from other movies is because of its emotion packed story. There is so much to laugh, so much to be excited and so much to be sad. As I walked out of the theater I have to say I was so content!I strongly recommend this movie not just to MCU or DC or superhero fans but to all movie lover because it's not just a good superhero movie, it's a good movie.","6 out of 13 found this helpful.

Chris Pine does a great job with his character he is really art of film Gal Gadot and Chris Pine has a great chemistry together, and its a female director Patty Jenkins about time knows how and know to make a Wonder Woman film. plot Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) Born and raised on the island of Themyscira, the child Diana dreams of becoming an Amazonian warrior. and it has a great motivation scenes to movie its pretty strong lines in film witch i love the script the way how its written great but its great that they didn't make her a b*tch around or crying out loud being annoying. she focus of her goals to be a Amazonian Warrior but scene doesn't so takelong it gets to point she has a hero inside her self. the island where they shot was very nice place Palinuro Italy. (Connie Nielsen)Queen Hippolyta, tells Diana that their people were enslaved by mankind, who were corrupted by the god of war Ares. Ares also slaughtered his fellow gods on Mount Olympus, including his father Zeus. Zeus manage to defeat Ares, but is mortally wounded. Before dying, Zeus created Themyscira and left behind a weapon (apparently in the form of a ceremonial sword) capable of killing his renegade son. Diana rescues pilot Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) does a great job for his role he is good hes character is bit like Steve Rogers Captain America he could be great role to fit in if Chris Evans didn't wanted to be in it. after his plane crashes off the coast of Themyscira The island is soon attacked by the German soldiers pursuing Steve. German solders comes in island The Amazon solders decide to fight against German soldiers. Diana leaves her home to try to stop the war. with Steve Diana arms herself with the ceremonial sword and leaves Themyscira with Steve to find and destroy and Isabel Maru / Doctor Poison (Elena Anaya) A mad scientist who isassociated with General Ludendorff and specializes in chemistry and Elena Anaya poisons Ares. villains are Erich Ludendorff (Danny Huston) An ambitious and iron fisted general of the German Army during World War I he is eh i wish villains could be better the villain is pretty boring in my opinion i refer villain from First Captain America Red Skull Hugo Weaving character a lot more better Danny Huston character is bit weak villain. Ares (David Thewlis) is eh villain in my opinion is eh noting special, but the rest of film is fun Wonder woman does a lot of things a lot action a lot fun to movie. its never a slow boring pace film it moves on quicker that's how i should say it. and her costume is very well done i love her costume looks more realistic looks more of her Wonder Woman style of looks bit like metal amour but its not really of metal amour looking. its more realistic looking of costume, they is great scenes of wonder woman fighting against war and war Steve Trevor hires hes guys who fight war is Sameer (Sa√Ød Taghmaoui), Charlie (Ewen Bremner), The Chief (Eugene Brave Rock) are great characters in film. and their is good action scenes Wonder Woman kicking German soldiers in butt great scenes. their is a lot strong Motivation that Gal Gadot says what she does her Motivation strong lines in movie her acting is great comes a surprise with her individual film. An incredible plot, entertaining from the first moment. Gal Gadot was born to play Wonder Woman, her performance was excellent, I love her! she does a great job as wonder woman. After the big surprise that gave Batman vs Superman film that includes wonder woman in her own movie. lucky film didn't fail at everyone but thank god it never failedeveryone and great success budget of film Batman vs superman works for me great but not for everyone but this may work on you better. better story and it has better direction to movie Gal Gadot Was BORN for this movie born for this role for wonder woman i think because they never made a big budget wonder woman film reason because they didn't want to hire a bad actress and lose budget and coast of film and that's why now its best time to make it with all Technology. the CGI explosions looked a bit fake and terrible to it like a low budget film Explosion looks but the film is still very well filmed and its great performance for gal Godot believe me if you really hated Batman vs Superman you will like this a lot more. 10 out 10","22 out of 66 found this helpful.

I didn't go into the movie with many expectations because I'm not as familiar with the lineage of WW as I am with many of the other big DC heroes.I have to say this movie was refreshing. Everything about the movie was great. It didn't jump around like most origin stories and it didn't linger. It times everything perfectly. I was emotionally invested in the story the whole way through. Gal Gadot was empowering and transparent in her role. What's unique about this story is it doesn't play as a shoot em up bang bang movie. WW is from a sheltered world and you go on a journey with her discovering essentially the human experience of good vs evil. I liked this because it connects her to us more so than any other super heroes. Her nativity and innocence allows the viewer to put themselves in her shoes or better yet see through fresh eyes.They did not over sexualize her character which was incredible. The sexist tones were subtle and played well with the period the film is set in. She isn't a warrior for women she is a warrior for justice, love, and peace. The chemistry between her and Chris Pine was remarkable as well. I could really feel there connection. It didn't seem forced and there wasn't any power struggle. They played as equals. The villainy in the film is well done. I won't go into any spoilers but the villainy served to elevate her character development more than playing equal parts for screen time.The only thing I think most will dislike is it's definitely a film that's setting up the expanded universe in DC. I don't feel it left any room for a foreseeable sequel. Which may be a good thing, and it might leave them a blank slate to take her story in any direction. Overall well done and this makes me so excited to see what's next for DC.","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

And after the dreadful Suicide Squad, my thoughts were the only thing that can save this universe was Wonder Woman's solo film. I am pleased to say that this film has done just that.I was a bit worried, given today's gender political climate, that we would be subjected to another preachy man-hating mess. I still have memories of the woeful Ghostbusters remake. But this movie is more concerned with uniting men and woman rather than dividing. There was no ill will towards us whatsoever. Instead, it showed the importance of Men and Woman working together while still acknowledging our flaws. Wonder Woman showed us her strength as well as her compassion. I know that there probably will be some who will find misandric undertones in this film, but I found the opposite.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

Haters gonna hate! Oh well, let them hate...
It took a while; ages if not; before even considering a movie based solely on a STRONG FEMALE character, a superhero.
This woman is wonder(ful)!After a too short appearance in the boring Batman v. Superman it was more than necessary to make a film based upon her character which will tell the genesis of Diana Prince(ss of...) a.k.a. Wonder Woman.
The opening sequence is one of the best introducing scene for a well known and beloved comics persona.
The scenery is beautiful, colorful at times and dark-ish for critical action scenes but always with the idea of remaining hopeful!
The direction is inventive and the choreographic for Wonder Woman's action scenes is on point.
Her naivete, her courage and her wisdom -*{even if most of the time she's not even considered as 'human being' from the Men she's surrounded by - except Steve Trevor, Sameer, Charlie and Chief}*- are trademarks for this first adventure, but the power she delivers is surely what makes her now very important for the DC Universe.The subtext throughout the movie is currently accurate.Gal Gadot has finally the occasion to show what she can do and she's literally going above and beyond her contracted hours.SPOILERS ALERT---*---just a tiny bit concerned about the main musical theme for WW's character during the film as I'm not quite sure it was the best choice; although it does work at the end of the trailer---*---SPOILERS ALERT_____________________________
Rating: 5 STARS / 5
Story: 5 STARS / 5
Direction: 5 STARS / 5 for Patty Jenkins

"9","/10","Wonder Woman is One for the History Books","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4586415/?ref_=tt_urv","emmreeder","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur97863953/?ref_=tt_urv","16 January 2019","Superhero movies are so prevalent today that it can often be difficult to see the differences when the similarities between the movies are so prominent. A childhood trauma or adversity overcome with determination and a little luck. Extravagant movies that differ in location and character but share many of the same qualities. Of course, superhero movies tend to have the most vocal and supportive fans across the movie genres, perhaps due to their feel good messages of good conquering over evil. While message is true in movies like Black Panther and Wonder Woman, their unique stories provide the audiences with a fresh take on the ever popular superhero movies.
The film kicks off in France at the Louvre, where Diana Prince, played by Gal Gadot, receives a package from Bruce Wayne. In the package, a picture and a note saying ""I found the original. Maybe someday you'll tell me your story."" The majority of the movie is a flashback, first transporting the viewers to the magical and exquisite island of Themyscira and focusing on Diana's childhood. When Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) stumbles upon the island, bringing German soldiers with him, the Amazons have their first encounter with the modern world. Steve and Diana set off to Europe with both hoping to end the war. Although the Wonder Woman comics are originally set during World War II, Director Patty Jenkins opted to change the time period to World War I, or the ""war to end all wars"" as it is referred to in the movie.
Gal Gadot masterfully creates the earnest and naive Diana, a refreshing twist from the usual angsty superhero movies, which exist both in Marvel and DC comics. Her belief that by defeating Ares, all of mankind will stop fighting shows the best. Her complete and perhaps unearned belief that mankind is inherently good, only serves to add to her naivety. Steve spends either in awe of Diana and incredulous. Chris Pine adds more passion and heart to the movie with his portrayal of Steve.
This is not to say that Wonder Woman is flawless, with a run time of around 2 hours and 30 min, it is rather long, not that most fans would have any objection to this. Jenkins also opts to include the overdone final fight scene at the end of the movie, however she does a nice job helping the audience to feel the emotions that the characters feel.
Danny Hurston, playing Ludendorff, the evil German general, along with Elena Anaya as the mad chemist intent of creating the largest weapon of death ever seen, are the main villains that both Chris and Diana are intent on stopping. Diana believes that Ludendorff is Ares, the Greek god of war, while Chris clearly doesn't believe the same. The two enlist a misfit band consisting of the ""Chief"" (Eugene Brave Rock), a black market smuggler, Charlie (Ewen Bremner) a struggling marksman, and Sameer (Said Taghmaoui) an undercover operative.
Director Patty Jenkins does a wonderful job of mixing humor in with the depressing aspects of war. One scene that does a great job of adding humor is when Steve's secretary Etta (Lucy Davis) takes Diana shopping for clothes, as her Greek clothes do not blend in well in London. Diana's insistence on the ridiculousness of the fashion trends, as well as her trying to properly move in the clothes does a nice job of adding humor to the film.
The costume designer, Lindy Hemming, did a wonderful job of creating costumes that convey the magical feel of Themyscira, and changing Wonder Woman's original costume with high heels to one more practical for fighting.
Overall, Wonder Woman does a fabulous job smashing the mold of a typical superhero movie, filled with angst and the overdone trope of overcoming a difficult event. Any flaws that exist do not detract from the viewers enjoyment. Jenkins does a masterful job of adding emotions and a realistic view of human behavior and life. This movie is refreshingly different, while still maintaining the aspects that make a superhero movie great. Wonder Woman is a must watch movie for the most avid superhero fans, as well as those who have never seen one.","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

Superman"", and ""Suicide Squad"", I just about lost hope in the DC Extended Universe. When I saw this film, however, my faith in this franchise was restored. This was an excellent movie that gave the franchise the kick that it needed.Gal Gadot was a wonderful choice for the role of Wonder Woman, and she pretty much nails the role. She looks the part, is convincing in the action scenes, and puts the right amount of emotion into the role. She also did a good job of selling that she is a character who has a lot to learn about the outside world.Steve Trevor is a nice supporting leading character, and is played well with Chris Pine. His chemistry with Gal Gadot was surprisingly good.One refreshing thing about this film is the color palette. After three films of nothing but bleak and gray, we finally get some bright colors to liven things up. There was also some wonderful cinematography.The story and character development are much stronger than expected and give the film a considerable amount of substance. The action scenes are thrilling and do a great job of establishing Wonder Woman a tough-as-nails hero.One complaint about the film is that Danny Huston isn't that great of a villain. He's not terrible, just rather forgettable. The film was also a bit overlong and had just a few too many slow-motion shots. The CGI effects also weren't the best.Overall, I am very happy with how this movie turned out. After how she was shoehorned in ""Batman v. Superman"", it was great that they finally did the character of Wonder Woman justice. One of the better superhero movies in recent memory and definitely recommended.RATING: A-","3 out of 5 found this helpful.

However, I think this film lives up to the high standards that Marvel have set over the years and hopefully DC will continue to produce movies of this standard in the future.Perhaps the poor reviews were written by people who are either biased in favour of Marvel or no longer enjoy the superhero genre.

In the touching moment of the climactic battle Gal Gadot's Diana sources power from her memories of those she loves, and those who love her. Her bold strong Aunt Antiope played by Robin Wright, who taught her to be the fiercest Amazon Warrior, implores her, ""You are stronger than this!"" Upon leaving her home to save the world her Mother Hippolyta, played by sublime Connie Nielsen, hugs Diana, ""You have been my greatest love. Today, you are my greatest sorrow¬Ö"" Steve played by Chris Pine, who loves Diana, says, ""I can save the day. You can save the world."" Greatness emerges out of those who love and believe in you. In Director Patty Jenkins and Screenwriter Allan Heinberg's ""Wonder Woman"" hero emerges as bravery for those you love and believe in. For Jenkins and Heinberg, love creates Hero. Gal Gadot is a star. She is stunningly beautiful. She amazes with her physical gifts and martial arts skills in battle. She eloquently captures the innocence of the child, who believes in her heart that good will always conquer evil, although the world can be gray‚Äîneither light or dark. The hero is in Gadot's gaze, her words, and her calm stillness. As Diana, she inspires us to use our powers for good. ""Wonder Woman"" too is inspired. A great movie. ""Wonder Woman"" is the origins story of Diana, who becomes the superhero of the comic book, reset in World War I. The movie bogs down some in the middle as the narrative shifts focus to the War with Germany. The deadly gas weapon of mass destruction created by disfigured Dr. Maru, played by mysterious Elena Anaya, is coveted by General Ludendorff, malevolently played by Danny Huston. Yet, the hero story truly mesmerizes. Jenkins brilliantly creates homage to Greek Mythology as Amazon Queen Hippolyta (Nielsen) narrates the fable. God Zeus created Mankind on earth. Zeus loved Man as his own children. Outraged with jealousy his son Ares, God of War, gave Man fear, anger, and war. To save Man, Zeus created the Amazon women warriors. The Amazon live and train on the island of Themyscira, shrouded from the rest of civilization and Ares himself. Matthew Jensen's cinematography captures the life and light of idyllic Themyscira. The land possesses the beauty and strength of the women, who reside there. Hippolyta and her sister Antiope (Wright) battle over young Diana's destiny. Diana's benevolent Mother Hippolyta wishes to spare her daughter of the warrior's sacrifice, her own past. Aunt Antiope knows Diana is the chosen one, and secretly trains her niece. Hippolyta refuses to reveal to Diana her secret destiny, instead having Antiope train Diana as the Amazon's fiercest warrior. The grown Diana (Gadot) becomes the valiant idealist and protector, fulfilling that part of her destiny. Also the bracelets she wears in battle reveal invincible power. The War shapes Diana's destiny. British Captain Steve Trevor, played by charismatic Chris Pine, crashes his plane in the waters off Themyscira. He has the plans for the deadly German nerve gas. Diana saves his life. However, the Germans pursue Steve as well. The Amazons along with Steve defeat the German soldiers, but with tragic loss. Realizing the world is in peril with ""the war to end all wars"", Diana disobeys her Mother's wishes, and sails with Steve back to London. Diana believes that to save Mankind she must slay Ares, God of War. Steve is sympathetic to idealist Diana; he only wants the War to end. Knowing Diana's destiny, her Mother lets her go. Diana takes along with her on the journey, the Amazon shield, and the sacred ""God Killer"" sword to defeat Ares. Gadot commands ""Wonder Woman"" and is the bright new star. She is amazing in all the screen battles. Her brave idealism and soul truly inspires. She tells British leader Sir Patrick, played by Danny Thewlis, ""You should be ashamed!""‚Äîthat his generals don't fight with their men on the battlefield. The hero arises from those who love her. Nielsen, Wright, and Pine are amazing. Nielsen is touching as Hippolyta the stoic Mother, who loves Diana with all her heart. Wright is ruthless compassion as the warrior, who sees the greatness within her. Pine is surprisingly poignant as the man, who loves Diana, giving her purpose. With Jenkins and Gadot, hero is about love. Hero always is. Perhaps, ""Wonder Woman"" can inspire other movie heroes to declare the same. Now that would be the grand legacy of ""Wonder Woman"".","11 out of 29 found this helpful.

Sure I have seen the Avengers and some of the standalone movies but usually I get bored during the smash everything up action scenes. The exceptions are the Guardians 1 & 2, Deadpool, and Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight Trilogy.Wonder Woman was different. I really enjoyed it. I thought the story, the action and the casting was all excellent. I figured Gadot would be pretty good. I mean she was about the only good thing in Superman vs Batman. But WOW, she exceeded my expectations.My wife asked me, can we see it again tomorrow. Even if she can't talk me into going tomorrow - if you are reading this, you should go see it.","11 out of 29 found this helpful.

The only superhero movies that are on the same level as Wonder Woman are Captain America The Winter Soldier and Logan.The film is very refreshing in many ways. First and most obvious is the magnificent female lead performed by Gal Gadot who is a perfect fit for this role. Second, a good balance of humor and seriousness, something that Marvel can't grasp after all these years. The movie is funny just when it needs to be and when the story gets more serious, all the jokes are eliminated. Third, choosing WW1 instead of WW2 because it was a conflict with no clear villain where all sides were to blame, and this concept fits the story perfectly. The director and cinematographers wonderfully manage to show the transition from paradise-like Themiskyra to regular Earth which is dark, corrupted, hateful and war torn; the theme that DCEU portrays in its comics, animation films and games. They show how Diana is shocked by this world and how she evolves while staying true to her core values and beliefs. The chemistry between Gal Gadot and Chris Pine kicks off right from the first glance and it was something marvelous and heart warming to watch. The rest of the cast deserves high praise too. My favorite part... the MUSIC. I would never give a movie a 10 if the music is not a right fit and this time it is a BIG 10!!! I got hyped about it from BVS and now finally I got my overdose of goosebumps and thrills. When it was combined with the action scenes, I almost jumped up on my chair. Speaking of action scenes... they were as Kick-ass as they come, right from the beginning until the end with fantastic camera work and great balance between Slow-mo and regular shots. There are not enough words to describe this film, its a start of something new and very big which I hope will be replicated in the rest of DCEU films. As wonderful a back-story as there could be!!! THANK YOU ALL FOR MAKING THIS","13 out of 36 found this helpful.

"10","/10","Gal Godot tells us about that picture in ""Dawn of Justice"".","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3778367/?ref_=tt_urv","XweAponX","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2366174/?ref_=tt_urv","11 August 2017","I loved the first impression of Diana Prince from Dawn of Justice. She had the look and the attitude, stood up to Bruce Wayne, and had the general appearance of competency. I've seen this actress in other films and this is who she is.But in this film, we see there was a time this was not so, she was not even allowed to train with the rest of the Amazon Women. Even after she did become the best of the Amazons, she was still kind of goofy. I enjoyed that stark contrast from the woman in Dawn of Justice.Of course, it took Chris Pine, who was still channeling his own goofy version of Kirk, to help define the Princess of the Amazons.And their interaction was what got me interested in this story. Imagine a World War I Soldier stumbling into an invisible island, full of Gorgeous Women who kill off an entire Nazi regiment? They have no idea what the world is about, and they send their Princess, actually Diana is more than just a princess as we learn later- They send this Princess out into a world she knows nothing about, so there is a short time where we see Diana continuously breaking protocol for women allowed in the early 20th Century. It was an opportunity for various Faux Pas, and well played. Also, she redeems herself nicely.But she sets herself an agenda based on the wrong impression of who the Bad Guy actually is. She has determined, without knowledge, that it must be a German General. Because she has no concept of deceit or trickery, this original ""virgin"" Wonder Woman has never been exposed to that, and it's a problem that Pine's character ""Steve Trevor"" teaches her how to deal with.Lynda Carter's version of Wonder Woman was enjoyable in a campy sort of way, but that version of WW never dealt with an important facet of the character: Her Immortality. And, in the Justice League comic books, there are only two immortals that are constantly in the center of things: Superman and Wonder Woman. I refer everyone to the wonderful Alex Ross illustrated ""Kingdom Come"", which better defines the relationship between Kal-El and Diana Prince.But this film is ""The Secret Origin of Wonder Woman"", who she was, who she is, where she came from, and her first love affair, although never Requieted. And IMDb's spell checker needs to be fixed to allow the word ""Requieted"". Unrequieted. Requieted.This film is not as dark and ominous as Batman V Superman, maybe it should have been. This is the DC version of Hydra, the Germans have a secret factory that makes a gas that makes Mustard Gas look like Nitrous Oxide.But all of the wonderful character actors in this are cast well, especially Danny Houston. And I haven't seen Connie Nielsen since ""Gladiator"", she's aged well and commands her role. Robin Wright is the Amazon who teaches Diana.These DCU movies have been panned hard, especially Dawn of Justice, and I've seen some very unfair #FakeReviews here, many of them verbatim duplicates of each other. It's doubtful that any of the people who made 1-star reviews have ever stepped foot in a theater. Still, last I looked, the rating for this film was standing up to the incredibly ridiculous bashing it has been taking from the #Fakes.So I say this, if you are a real person, a DC Comics fan, a woman, or just anyone who doesn't waste their life in Reddit r/TheDonald or 4chan/b, you'll like this, I've interviewed many people who watched this, and they unanimously liked it a lot. We can't let Bots and Trolls tell us anything about Hollywood, let them watch The Apprentice, it's the only thing their mentality can grasp. Even comic books are over their heads.","10 out of 26 found this helpful.

The trailers did nothing to spark my interest and it almost looked like Gal would not deliver. Boy was I wrong! Wonder Woman has pretty much everything superhero movies of today seem to have forgotten about. It has heart, and it really makes you care so much about what Diana is going through and what is happening around her. Yes the CGI did look corny in some scenes but I'd like to believe that this was overshadowed by the story telling and character development. This was a big step up for Gal Gadot, and Chris Pine definitely owned the role of Steve Trevor. All the supporting cast, apart from a few issues, did almost everything right to add on to the chemistry between the two leading characters. I loved the portrayal of ""Themyscira"" (I hope I spelled it right), and the opening fight scene with with the amazonian warriors was great. The pacing was just about okay, and the directing was almost perfect. As far as superhero movies go, I'll give this a 10/10. Way to go DC!!","9 out of 23 found this helpful.

So going into this film I wasn't sure what I was expecting to see but after just 10 minutes of watching I realized that it was going to be very good. Round of applause for DC and Warner bros because this film had almost everything you'd expect to see in a ideal superhero film. The way the story is set out as a reflection on her past and brings us to her childhood really builds up the character and makes the film much more enjoyable. Gal Godot was excellently cast and and was mesmerizing to watch on the big screen. Chris Pine was the perfect pair to her character and added humour and depth to the story-line. Would definitely recommend giving a watch however be aware that you may be running around and pretending you are as strong a Wonder Woman for up to a month after watching the film.","9 out of 23 found this helpful.

Its not just a action flick you usually get with marvel movies( no hate) but also an emotional movie. It has a beautiful lovable cast, story, directing, cinematography, music and etc .. But I gotta admit, at first i was a bit of disappointed because of what they'd shown in the trailer like there's no thrill watching it but then when at the last part of the movie, I was shocked and I didn't expect it at all. Yeah it was kinda clich√© but it was a good plot twist for the movie. It was refreshing to watch a superhero movie like that 'cause these days, its always comedy and war to the point you'll just rely with the story of it for your time's worth. But this movie gave us something, something we haven't seen in any superhero movie. ""It's not about what you deserve. It's about what you believe."" that was a good quote, by the way, even though its simple. Diana and Steve story was achingly beautiful. In a short amount of time they got in each other's skin and fell in love with each other but the problem was, they fell for each other in a wrong place and time. This is the second time I watched a superhero got me off guard (BvS:DOJ). In this origin story its not just about what the character did to save the world, it also showed how and why the character became a hero to the world as diana witnessed all the goodness and bad in this world.","9 out of 23 found this helpful.

Wonder Woman delivers in one of the most heart felt superhero movies ever. Great story telling starting Wonder Woman's journey as a child watching and learning from her fellow Amazonians on the beautiful Paradise Island to blossoming into the Amazonian warrior that makes her wonderful. There were many moments that pulled your heart strings in a way unlike any other superhero movie. Great action scenes accompany the movie but the emotional connection between the characters is what carries this film. Very surprising and well done to see a superhero movie excel because of the great acting from the entire cast and not because of any special effects. Wonder Woman is truly wonderful.","4 out of 8 found this helpful.

She pulled it off BIG time.As I sat in the theater and marveled at this film, I kept thinking that not only should parents rush their little girls out to see it, they should rush their boys out as well. Wonder Woman really sets a new paradigm for how women can and should be seen in film.Why?Now keep in mind that this is a man talking, but I loved the fact that Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman is such a lovely mix of intelligence, power, strength, beauty, empathy, humor, vulnerability, righteousness, integrity and yes, love.I dare say that I think we're still living during a time when many people confuse strength and meanness in women. Far too many men think ill of strong women and I think, ironically, a lot of women do too.However, the fantastic news with ""Wonder Woman"" is that even in these cynical times, there isn't a trace of ""the B word"" to be found in this characterization. Somehow, I've also equated meanness with fearfulness, but Woman Woman is SO confident and powerful that she need not be either.Oh, and another thing. Wonder Woman is probably the least exploited, strong woman character that I've ever seen on film. In that sense, she's somewhat like Emma Peel from ""The Avengers"" television series, but on superhero steroids.However, having said that, both women are totally hot. They just don't ""lead"" with their ""hotness."" Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman has power that doesn't lie in her sexuality ‚Äì although, believe me, she has that ‚Äì but rather in her personal integrity, strength of character, superhero strength and intelligence. It's a winning combo that no strong man who's sure of himself wants to miss.I'm glad I did not.There's no doubt that a male director would've ""tarted up"" Wonder Woman. Doing so would give men some sense of control over this powerful and threatening female figure. However, that's not the case here.Yes, Wonder Woman is a symbol, but Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot obviously worked hard to make her human and real and they've completely avoided compromising her power by making her an object. Mission accomplished.If I weren't too long in the tooth, I'd get a Wonder Woman poster for my bedroom wall ¬Ö However, if I did, I'm sure she'd be angry and would come bursting through the wall and beat me good for it.In the next film, I'd love to see Wonder Wonder tackle Neanderthal Man.No contest.

"8","/10","Enamouring in its powerful display of what a female superhero film can look like, a thoroughly enjoyable and surprisingly clever blockbuster.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3729662/?ref_=tt_urv","joshteggert","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur33870179/?ref_=tt_urv","13 June 2017","Putting aside the famous cape and cowl, the infamously grumpy Supes', and deterring from the unfittingly grim tone of the DC Extended Universe up to now, 'Wonder Woman' embodies a fresh start for the franchise, underpinned by subtle yet reverberating messages that are likely to inspire future instalments in several, encouraging mannerisms. Patty Jenkins has produced a truly gratifying entry into DCEU, defying all odds and breaking barriers which should now open the floodgates to more much needed positivity in the DCEU.There was plentiful doubt amongst fans upon hearing the news that 'Wonder Woman' would be set during the First World War. But actually, this change in back drop, not only is it suitable in displaying the film's forceful morals, is a stimulating shift that allows Jenkins to explore the fundamentals of humanity without needing Bruce Wayne to have an existential crisis (a la 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice'). The narrative follows Amazonian princess, Diana (Gal Gadot), and her journey with Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), a spy for British intelligence, as they venture into the front-line battlements of World War I, attempting to stop a potentially world threatening force. The 1918 setting allows for a clever guise in the Germans as a resonant opposing force, but as the story unfolds, the horrors of war sparks turmoil within Diana, who painfully begins to understand that she can't save everyone.Gadot really puts on a magnificent show; perfectly cast as the Amazonian legend, she is now an icon in the industry, a new figurehead for the DCEU going forward. Supported by a fantastic array of individually absorbing characters, with a notably gripping performance from Chris Pine, 'Wonder Woman' is compellingly personal, contrasted with exhilarating action pieces which culminate to present a formidable overall conviction. Diana's initially na√Øve outlook on humanity adds superb depth to the narrative as she slowly yet reluctantly understands the barbaric nature of the world of man, and this allows it to be the first DC film to have such a convincing moral stance since 2008's 'The Dark Knight'.It flows much like any other superhero film, and the origin story backdrop leaves a lot to be wished for in the opening third of the film particularly, but its packed with laughter, tears and kicks that make the build up to the unveiling of Wonder Woman in all her glory more than worth the wait (a scene which is wholeheartedly one of the best in the genre's history). Diana also has a much more interesting background, making this a story that is justifiably explored and, moreover, delightfully told.A long time in the making, even longer in its legacy, 'Wonder Woman' is a modern pioneer for superhero movies. It demonstrates that, not only can a female hero be just as spellbinding, if not more so, than her male counterparts, but that DC is capable of making good films if it stops being so damn gloomy, and adds a dash of positivity in it place.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

First, some history; Wonder Woman was a DC character that first appeared around 1941. She was created by William Moulton Marston. WW prevailed through the several ages of comics, and by doing so created a significant following that fully encouraged this feminist revision. She has endured decades of television and movies, some good, others bad. They include:1974 film starring Cathy Lee Crosby1975-1979 TV series starring Lynda Carter2009 direct to DVD animated film2011 TV Pilot starring Adrianne PalickiAnd of course numerous appearances in other DC filmsIn this retelling, Diana (Gal Gadot) is summoned from her euphoric island home to help American spy Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) during WW1. Their mission is to stop the deadly efforts of Dr. Poison (Elena Anaya) and Gen. Ludendorff (Danny Huston). But Diana, creation of the gods themselves, believes that humans are innately good and human corruption by evil god Ares is to blame. Trevor sets out to destroy Ludendorff's lethal poison gas and Diana joins him with the intent of killing Ares in his human incarnation. I loved this film. I've seen it twice. I found myself genuinely caring when a specific character was in danger. I cannot tell you the last time I sat in a cinema and thought that. In terms of flaws, 'WW' holds few. A few things that I did not enjoy was the casting choice for Ares. I know that the intent was obviously for surprise, but choosing an actor with that physique did not really fit earlier descriptions of Ares. I also thought that Dr. Poison and Ludendorff were a bit underdeveloped, but enjoyable. The relationship between Trevor and Diana is striking. True, the romance is a bit rushed but I liked the equality and fairness to it. It seemed very honest and real as not just a romance, but as partners. The most stunning thing about 'WW' is Diana. We see her as this innocent and naive girl who sees morality in only black and white. But after her exposure to humans, to war, Diana realizes that humans have the capability to be evil. It will ultimately come down to a choice each one of us will make that will determine our place in human history. 9/1090%A","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

And then, this movie appeared.I think it's the best adaptation of this character that we could get on big screen and she truly deserved it. It tells the story of how Diana of Themyscira (Gal Gadot) decides to go with the pilot Steve Trevors (Chris Pine) to help on the world happening around the world. The story may be quite simple but it's told in a very entertaining way, that at any moment feels boring, maybe just a bit right before they get to the war. For me one of the biggest fails of the movie is the villain, that at the end felt like a bit rushed up and you can't clearly see what were his intentions and this, for some, may get the final act to a lower level.The secondary characters don't appear that much and they don't to do many things because the real important part here is for the two main characters, Steve & Diana. Chris Pine did a very good job as the love interest of Diana, bringing some emotional moments and when he is with Gal Gadot they provide some very funny moments, specially near the beginning of the movie. And that's a good thing, to have some humour in it but just when needed. If you're in the middle of a Battlefield or fighting against the God of War you don't need to say any joke, but if you're in London discovering how the women were treated in that time maybe they really fit for show the surprise of Diana. And here the true star for me was Gal Gadot as the Amazon Princess of Themyscira. I think his appearance in Batman V Superman was very powerful and truly showed that he fitted the role perfectly, but in this movie, you also get to see that she can really act.The visuals were as amazing as in the other DC Universe movies, with a very peculiar visual style that I hope they keep through all the movies because it's truly amazing. All the slow-mo moments are very powerful (for example the amazing No Man's Land scene or the part where she enters the Germans base full of anger or even the whole opening scene). To this you have to add the amazing score that Rupert Gregson-Williams created, using the theme that appeared in Batman V Superman and also creating many powerful, heroic and emotional themes.A must see for all the DC fans, superhero fans, and specially Wonder Woman fans, I think they really created a very good movie for this character, that really deserved it.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

"8","/10","A solid entry in the DCEU...for once","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3741499/?ref_=tt_urv","greggs_nbacon","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur27818897/?ref_=tt_urv","28 June 2017","(Originally posted from confessionsofasavagemind.blogspot.com)The DC Comics Extended Universe of films has been so an abysmal drag as a film goer. Man of Steel was all style and no substance, Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice was a dull snoozefest, while Suicide Squad was the cinematic equivalent of injecting liquid Lucky Charms into your brain. However, I am here to say that DC and Warner Brothers has finally produced a good movie to their resume. That comes in the form of Wonder Woman.Earlier this summer, I was very cynical about Wonder Woman's chances of being successful at all. I predicted it could be one of the biggest flops of this year. In hindsight, I will admit that my view might have been slightly misogynistic. In all fairness though, there has never been a movie with this kind of budget not only centered around a woman but directed by a woman. The studio system has forever sold us, the moviegoer, the idea that a film directed or about women cannot be a box office success. That being said, the ideology needs to change to a film can be a box office success no matter what the topic or who directs it, as long as the film is well made. Wonder Woman has proved this to me and should be noted for its cinematic achievement.Now, after the praise, I will say one thing: Wonder Woman is a good movie. Not a great movie, but a good one. I think that the film has gotten grossly over-hyped because of how amazing it is in comparison to the other DC films. It's like comparing a tortilla to moldy bread. There's nothing wrong with the tortilla, but it's a hell of a lot better than some moldy bread. I don't hate the film for the exact template of generic superhero movies (one that was perfected by Marvel) It succeeds at being a solid entity. The film also does a better job of selling its themes of the morality of war and the nature of humanity far better than most Marvel movies. It is to be noted that even though the film had three story credits, Allan Heinberg is the only credited writer for the screenplay. As many of these big budget films go, there are several ideas on how the film should go. The studio then gets several screenwriters to write several different screenplays. The studio then takes the best parts of each screenplay and then creates Frankenstein's monster out of the remains. So it was to my surprise when the story was actually cohesive and well thought out. The film is not only a good superhero film but a good war film. Director Patty Jenkins adds the proper feminine touch that is so needed in gritty war films, as Kathryn Bigelow proved in The Hurt Locker. One problem that arose for me in the film is the lack of consequence of the violence of war. Yes, some disturbing images were shown in the film to try and get this point across, but the lack of bloodshed I found disturbing. There is a theory that young people who kill because of what they have seen in the movies would understand the severity of using guns. Some movies such as Deadpool and Logan have proved that violence can work in blockbusters, so why would Wonder Woman avoid it?In terms of performances, I thought the show was completely stolen by Gal Gadot. When Gadot was chosen for the role, I was entirely unsure if she could overcome her looks to give good performances. After all, many performers whose physiques are aesthetically pleasing rest on the laurels of their looks far too often. Gadot proves this through the absolute charm and wit she shows with a combined sense of naivety and strength exuded in her performance. Chris Pine did actually well considering he has always reminded me in looks and performances of one of the puppets from Team America: World Police. The current superhero films are still lacking some truly great contemporary villains, however, and I am disappointed again by Wonder Woman. No other performances particularly enamored me, as my eyesight was always drawn to Gadot the entire length of the film.Overall, Wonder Woman hits every note it needs to hit with strength, poise, and grace. It is truly a crime that this film was director Patty Jenkins first film since she wowed audiences with her horrific biopic Monster. Jenkins puts out a strong case against industry sexism while producing a solid superhero film.Grade: (8/10)","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

If you've seen Batman v Superman(which you should), the Wonder Woman theme from that movie has returned, but it is used appropriately and is badass whenever it plays. The theme plays a total of 3 times throughout the film, and isn't used when it shouldn't be. It also has something that Batman versus Superman lacked, comedy. This movie is very funny, it's not as funny as a Marvel movie, but it has enough that the film benefits from it and doesn't ruin the tone of the film. Speaking of tone, it is still as dark as a DC movie, it has death throughout it, but the humor keeps it fun.

"8","/10","DC Finding Its Groove Back, Wonder Woman is propelled by great direction and Gal Gadot","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3755526/?ref_=tt_urv","diac228","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3387663/?ref_=tt_urv","14 July 2017","I have been a vocal critic of the Warner Brothers/DC array of entertainment since Dark Knight Rises disappointed me immensely during that one fateful night. And for years after that I have been led down a dark path of pure disillusionment that ranges from the frustrating Snyder saga that gets nearly everything wrong, the unforgivable Teen Titans reboot, the strange cartoons we've seen of Batman, and of course the fiasco involving the animated adaptation of Killing Joke's abysmal first act. It's reached a point in which I was accused of just hating DC altogether. But I have finally seen a good side of DC cinematically, and it's in the shape of Wonder Woman.Wonder Woman isn't perfect, but is hands-down the best product from the DC/Warner Brothers spectrum since The Dark Knight ignited and changed the film industry back in 2008. Whatever issues you can dig up in the movie will be eradicated by a superb cast, great amount of respect for the source material, and an entertaining flick with a nice blend of action, comedy, drama, and comic book flair. The film doesn't try too hard to win you over, as it paces nicely to allow you to warm up to our newest Wonder Woman and her allies.Damaging some of the momentum of Wonder Woman has nothing to do with the movie, but its actually the timing. If this had been made and released before Batman vs. Superman and the revelation of Justice League it could have had a deeper impact to the DCEU; similar to when the original Iron Man jump-started the ultra-successful Marvel series of films. Wonder Woman sets the correct tone and mood for the DCEU and is the first of the modern DC properties to successfully establish the direction the comic book company was engaging in. It's dark, its gritty, doesn't have much time for jokes, even if we saw plenty of them in the first two acts.Gal Gadot is absolutely perfect as Wonder Woman. Whatever complaints you may have had about her should be diminished off of the face of the earth because she gave the role life, personality, a sense of wonderment, a layer of feminist power, and the exotic flavor to truly separate her from the rest of the characters in World War 1 Europe. She has great chemistry with everyone around her, especially Chris Pine as Steve Trevor, the WW1 spy that accidentally stumbles upon the hidden world of Themyscira. Trevor's initial appearance allows the plot to move from Diana's hometown to wartorn England, where she wants to find the source of the war and end it as soon as possible using her warrior skillset, determination, and desire to make the world good again. Of course, with war, there is no easy answer, there is no person to point to, which contradicts Princess Diana's viewpoints of the way the world works.Not sure how Patty Jenkins, a great but quiet director, wound up with the director's chair since she isn't as big a name in Hollywood. Nonetheless, she does a great job with Wonder Woman by spending time with the characters, allowing us to get to know everyone, and showcasing the horrors and consequences of war to complicate a simple plot. Then we have the feminist empowerment imagery and the well-designed action sequences that make up for the budget that isn't quite as high as that of the Marvel blockbusters. The village battle sequence especially is a delight. The final act however behaves a bit much like Marvel when it could have behaved more like the grounded Dark Knight in terms of content and execution (the villain should have been handled differently, common theme in recent comic book films), but it won't ruin the overall experience in the least bit.Wonder Woman connects better with the audience than the modern Batman and modern Superman. Chalk that up to Snyder and the subpar writing team, but Wonder Woman just might wind up being the new face of the DCEU because of Gadot and the way she has handled the character. This is the one branch of the franchise that needs to be protected from weak sequels and weak decision-making towards the character's future. They have something great here, about as strong as Robert Downey Jr.'s Iron Man portrayal. I beg they don't mess this up, as Wonder Woman is the best-written and performed cinematic female superhero since Elastigirl from The Incredibles.We finally have a DC movie on par with Marvel. Even though Wonder Woman imitated Marvel a bit too much in the climax, this is still a step in the right direction. Jenkins, Gadot (especially), Pine, Allen Heinberg (wrote the script), and the rest of the cast should be proud for striking the right combination between comic book mayhem and great emotional depth to allow us to care for the cast. I am silently begging that DC and Snyder doesn't mess this up, even though the track record would say otherwise. Wonder Woman is a long-awaited empowering delight, and hopefully a sign of more great DC-related works to come.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

The plot although quite simple and maybe a little naive, manages to attract the interest of the spectator and doesn't get boring. The humorous moments come to complete this beautiful puzzle with the action and the - rather over-used - slow motion and give us a quite satisfactory result which addresses not only to DC fans, but to anyone who loves action movies with humanistic messages.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

I love comic book movies though. Both the DC and Marvell series have been really good. Logan was a good movie, but not as good as I had hoped. I haven't seen Ghost in a Shell Yet or Atomic Blonde, so I would put Wonder Woman as the best comic book type action movie of the year.It's by no means a chick flick. I think it's a movie girls would like, but it's definitely a male fantasy. I don't know why some reviewers are saying the rating is downgraded by men who don't like the idea of a female superhero. Any man would be honored to get their *** kicked by Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot is gorgeous. She plays the part of a naive girl who after growing up on a paradise island, gets to see what the rest of the world is like. She plays it well. There is a lot of action in this movie. It's based during WW1, and it's actually pretty dark at times (the atmosphere). The action scenes are excellent. They aren't pointless. The movie builds up to the action sequences. It was a really good movie.There are a few things I would change about it though. First off, I would throw an R rating on it, add more violence and less clothing on Amazonia.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

For I think the first time in film really, you have a male lead playing the feminine role, and the female lead playing a man's role! Chris Pine can pull that off well - he's kind of a small man, very polite, sort of a damsel in distress at times. And you have Gal Gadot who has a deep, agressive voice at times, pushing on without cease til the end. Chris Pine is kind of the T-1000 character - he is an allied spy and he uses this ability several times to infiltrate, and is kind of the conscience of the film.This movie is, in short, astounding! Chris Pine is a great actor to bring into this part, although I thought that at times he seemed a bit preachy and couldn't let go of his Captain Kirk persona. The setting is World War I, but at times it seemed like an episode of Star Trek: The Next Generation, where the humans help the aliens navigate the culture of the day. In short: it gets old, but fortunately it didn't go too far. As an admirer of history, there were nuggets of the prevailing culture of the day that even the hero, Diana, the wonder woman, found hard to grasp. Gal Gadot's beauty carried the movie away, her every pose in the movie was beautiful. There is no such thing as a bad scene with her in it!There are lots of references to ancient Hellenic (Greek mythology) which I found endearing. The action scenes were pretty solid, although I thought there could have been more.The movie is not silly like some action movies like Independence Day 1 & 2 which is a good thing.The themes were not political in nature which is another plus. The theme seems to be: man himself is a beast who brings evil upon himself. The entire film flows very well together. I think the reason this film is popular is because it is something fresh and new and different.Gal Gadot's performance was good. However, I found that the character was a little wet-behind-the-ears. Maybe this was intentional, as she was supposed to portray a naive young woman, but I felt that in several scenes, she should have scratched her head and asked more questions and been a little more reflective and less hormonal. You get the impression that the writers / directors were missing several character development points and plot points I thought went unanswered. I wish to compare her performance to Milla Jovovich in 5th Element. At the end of that movie, MJ shows a little bit of vulnerability in her character. I wonder if Gal Gadot is capable of the same range as an actress as MJ, but this may be scriptural problem.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Not only does it have a female superhero as the unchallenged lead character, but it's also a genuinely great film with fantastic characters, an engaging storyline, beautiful action scenes and phenomenal production values.And this could have gone wrong so easily. Chris Pine could have been made the actual lead character, with Wonder Woman playing a support role in her own title movie. It could have been just as dark and gloomy as the previous DCEU films. It could so easily have been too corny and pandering.But it's not. Chris Pine is fantastic as the male lead, but this story is about Wonder Woman, and Gadot delivers us one of the best superheros in cinema history. It's so refreshing, almost revolutionary, to see superhero that does good not because she has to, or because she believes she's the only one that can or because she just happened to be there, but because she wants to. Because it's the right thing to do. When you think about it, that's much rarer than you think. There's Captain America. But aside from him, who else? Certainly no one in the DC films. And not all characters can be like that, not all should be like that. But some do.And that whole ideal permeates the entire film. It's honest and goodhearted. It delivers a straightforward origins story that still has the capacity to talk about the meaning of human life, about responsibility, about corruptibility, about the duality of human morality. It believes that people can do terrible things, but also that they can rise up and stand for what they believe to be right. Its heroine is not some distant god-figure - despite being the only literal god in the DC film canon so far - that flies far above us bringing with her chaos and destruction. Rather she walks amongst us and raises us up to stand next to her.It even has colours in it. Actual vibrant colours. And the fight scenes are some of the best I've ever see. The characters have depth and forge actual bonds between one another. It's even funny. Actually funny. I laughed multiple times throughout the film.And yes, the end battle is weaker than the rest of the film. Noticeably so. But it is preceded by a great twist, looks pretty cool and the final ending after that is heartwarming. But the rest of the film is so good that I can forgive that one scene.I healed a little bit inside as I watched this film. It is an honest film, with no trickery, no wise-cracking at the audience, no emotional manipulation. It isn't afraid to be called cheesy because it knows that you have to take that risk in order to connect emotionally. And by gods, does it succeed. Easily one of the best superhero films ever made. Please, do yourself a favour.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

Gal Godot is a find as Wonder Woman, balancing wisdom and naivete, assurance and uncertainty. She plays Wonder Woman as serious without being ponderous -- something that was missing from earlier DC films. (I'm looking at you, Superman.) Setting the film during World War I is a bit risky, but it gives the film a different feel and a suitable stage for the confrontation with Ares. I continue to be disappointed with climactic battle scenes created almost entirely in CGI; this film is no worse than most and at least limits its worst uses to the a few minutes at the end. I very much want to see Diana Prince carried forward into the present day: familiar with the world, canny in its ways, but still holding to her timeless values. Until then, we have an origin story that feels fresh and fun, and which brings us a wonderful new character and actor.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

This movie showed that Wonder Woman is not just a hero for Females but for everyone. Gal Gadot was pretty hot as Wonder Woman and delivered an exceptional job on her performance showing innocents and hope when needed with killer action sequences that kept me engaged throughout the whole movie. Chris Pine's portraying of Steve Trevor was amazing as well with his added charm and comedy to the movie with some of his own killer action sequences. Both portrayals of these characters showed great chemistry throughout the film which kept me invested with these characters. The two negatives in this movie was the villains which are sub-par for such a blockbuster and some shaking cgi in the final battle which could have been tweak prior to the film's release (no film is prefect). Overall the message this film sends of love and hope really makes this movie for everyone to watch. With some negatives I found, it still does not take away from this film to be inspirational and entertaining. This film saved the DC extended universe and is a must watch.","9 out of 24 found this helpful.

In this case, the plane piloted by Steve Trevor that crashes in Amazon territory is a German plane that he stole from the Central Powers in World War I. German forces follow the plane and engage in a battle with the Amazonians. Determined to return to his military duties, Steve Trevor convinces Diana that he needs to leave and contrary to their laws, she goes with him.Together, they search for Ares, the god of war that Diana is convinced is the driving force keeping the war going. In order to blend in, Diana must adopt more modest clothing and tone down her forceful personality. This generates some humorous moments, one must remember that this is the second decade of the twentieth century, before women could even vote and had few other rights.Aided by a bizarre cast of fellow soldiers, Steve Trevor leads his band with Diana in search of the German leader Ludendorff. Diana is convinced that Ludendorff is Ares in human form. Moving behind the lines to a secret military research facility, Trevor's commandos strive to destroy the German superweapons, which is a deadly gas against which the standard gas masks are useless.The battle is ferocious with intense and detailed special effects being used to depict widespread destruction when the superpowered beings unleash their powers against each other in one-on-one combat. Which is of course standard action in the modern superhero movie.Depicted as a very powerful being, Wonder Woman is capable of taking on male gods and defeating them. Fortunately, Steve Trevor does not act like a man of that era, yet the members of the British government do. Diana's appearance in government chambers is met with intense disapproval. In that way, the movie manages to depict both the earlier and modern eras, which is in keeping with the reason for the creation of the character of Wonder Woman.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

She was able to balance humour and a light touch with moments of levity. The story had a character who saw the world in black-and-white ending up in a situation where things were grey.Wonder Woman did lift from historical set films, i.e. X-Men: First Class. Captain America: The First Avenger, and the Robert Downey Jr. Sherlock Holmes films. These were films that compared history with a comic book styling.Wonder Woman was a great looking film and the No Man's Land scene was one of the best superhero introductions put to film.

Although I am a DC fan, I'd never read the Wonder Woman comics themselves although she was a member of the Justice League Of America comics which I did read avidly as a boy.There was an entertaining introductory prologue where we see the young Amazon Princess Diana learning her skills as well as gaining the independence she needs to later strike out on her own as she joins forces on the front line of World War One with Steve Rogers, an American soldier working undercover for British Intelligence, whose path initially crosses with hers when he accidentally leads the pursuing Germans to Paradise Island while escaping with top secret information vital to the war effort.I thought the idea of transposing the action to 1918 a clever and effective one as it reduces the need for over-the-top ""God On God"" SFX pyrotechnics and in a neat twist, centred the action on the day before Armistice Day, making Diana's Mission all the more important and urgent.Of course, being a super heroine, Wonder Woman, of necessity, requires a super-villain to push against, and after being sidetracked by another competing red herring, a suitably all- powerful foe in the person of fellow God Ares, played by David Thewlis, emerges in time for a climactic battle at the end. Thewlis however is better in his part before he reveals himself and has to be kitted out in his Greek toga to provide a seemingly unlikely foil against our girl.Gal Gadot, highly praised in the title part, is indeed excellent in her role, whether playing the day-saving heroine or the innocent abroad character trying to settle into wartime London. Athletic and attractive she holds the movie together well. Chris Pine supports her ably as the down-to-earth hero Rogers.I did feel the kitchen-sink climax between Wonder Woman and Ares undid a lot of the good work that had gone before as it too garishly contrasted with the WW1 realism striven for elsewhere.One of DC's better recent movie entries, the story did however seem to write itself into a number of dead ends by the end from which it will be interesting to see how the writers move things on. However, in the comic universe, as we've seen many times before, all things are possible and I look forward to seeing this character return in future adventures.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Bluntly: the major poster/trailer fight scene, and the fight scene after that.
Ridiculous and overblown and the principles of the character echoed a mere MINUTE before went flying out the window for some spectacle. Especially since she was not fighting nazis in WW1...

They were cheap and could be passed from person to person. Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman were our heroes. We were cult followers of these characters after we graduated from Walt Disney.So as older people we have a background of experiences to call upon when it comes to these characters. We will always look upon them in a positive way but our new experiences with the new technology and media has brought some negativity to these worthy characters so we watch them with new eyes. The media has not continue to enhance our memories. It has taken me awhile to watch this Wonder Woman but here I am.The men of that time were totally chauvinistic and opinionated thinking woman couldn't do anything. They lived in a patriarchal society. The women didn't even have the vote at that time. So this Amazon is furious with their behaviour of sending young men to war and not going themselves. London was pretty dismal in those days.I loved it. Where my old world came in contact with the new technological world. You know how we still want to keep our fantasies and magic.

Hear me out first.""Oh DCEU, you keep churning out mediocre movies and boast of box office returns as a reason to shove down more mediocrity down our throats. Although I loved Man Of Steel (coz I am sucker for Supes) we need to digest the fact that mediocrity in movies and encouraging and supporting them has only made DCEU to not push any envelope. Its no news that Marvel, despite their kiddy-friendly, formulaic movies, is at the top of their game and catching up to them is a feat for DC. If they really want to do that they would have to invest time in fleshing out characters in solo movies than dump a ton in one movie trying to get ahead of the race.I stopped rooting for DCEU after the third strike that was: Suicide Squad, it was a serviceable movie but has only disappointed me further after the ambitious yet disastrous Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. And this made me genuinely skeptic going in for Wonder Woman. Going against all odds, Wonder Woman had a gargantuan task on its shoulders to come out as at least 'amply entertaining'. Suffice to say, despite its weak screenplay and a flashy 3rd act, Wonder Woman is a winner and much more than being just 'entertaining'.Directed by Patty Jenkins, Wonder Woman soars above all the other DCEU movies. It was a low bar to clear when it comes to DC movies but its a superbly cast, well directed comicbook movie staying almost true to its roots. Jenkins had to fight to make the movie the way she wanted it to be made. Being an origin movie and one which was never on celluloid format before, Wonder Woman does it just right. Tonally, it feels very different from the other DC movies we've seen so far when it came to composition, color balance, and the inclusion of Diana-centric battle scenes like the iconic No Man's Land scene. It's indeed a feat since the studio had been breathing down the creator's necks, strangling their creative liberty. Did I mention that Wonder Woman also has humour? Yes, you heard it right, a DCEU movie with chuckle-worthy, non-corny moments which isn't forced as well. I am going to give a blind eye to whomever compares it to Captain America The First Avenger. Apart from the genre and the war setting, there isn't much similarities between the two. Apples & Oranges, people! I'd be treading on spoiler territory so I won't tell what they've done, but DC had the balls to do what Marvel never did (you'll know it when you're done with the movie).Despite my initial skepticism, Gal Gadot embodies Wonder Woman almost flawlessly or at least appearance-wise. Its hard to take your eyes off her when she's onscreen. She shined in her fish-outta-water sequences in London and she nailed it in the well choreographed action sequences on the frontline. Like Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark or Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, its tough to imagine anybody else but Gal in Wonder Woman's shoes for a while. I am sold on Gal playing Wonder Woman. Chris Pine still proves that he's still the best Chris in the industry. I had my doubts on his Steve Trevor character before watching the movie, but he proves to be the best addition that actually lends a lot of heart to the movie Like they say, ""behind every successful woman there is a...wait, wasn't it the other way around...my bad! And its no surprise that Robin Wright aced it as Diana's Amazonian badass aunt, Antiope. Both Elena Anaya and Danny Houston might have shared a little more than 20 minutes screen time with decent performances from both but it wouldn't have hurt to flesh out their characters more, especially Elena's Dr. Poison.As for the cons, among loose threads aplenty, it is still a 'save-the-world' narrative that we have seen a million times before. Yes, they've got the Wonder Woman character 'almost' right but that doesn't essentially make a great movie. Gal Gadot is indeed a breath of fresh air, a sight for sore eyes but the same cant be said about her acting chops. Agreed, she's new to all of this but she has a long way to go. Another major flaw is something that had also been haunting Marvel movies since day one: weak antagonists. Its tough to raise major stakes when its a superhero movie and although the antagonists in Wonder Woman tries hard to make a kebab outta the world, the lead villain is not even mildly intimidating whom still doesn't look like a menace Wonder Woman cant handle. Also that 3rd act was very reminiscent of Batman Vs Superman's loud and flashy finale, which was another weak point strikingly in contrast with a very colorful Thermyscra-based first act and a grim yet exciting battle-heavy second act.Movie scores are something I have grown listening to and humming to all my life. Sadly, Rupert Gregson William's Wonder Woman score doesn't live up to the movie's visuals. I'd say its ridden with the same flaw as Marvel's score, its sounded generic. The only bits that was exciting was when the movie used Hans Zimmer's original Wonder Woman theme from Batman Vs Superman and that definitely gave me goosebumps.I'll be frank, I havent read much Wonder Woman comics and like many, I was seasoned to macho-superheroes. I loved her in the Justice League tv show, 2009's animated movie (which is brilliant) and Batman Vs Superman yet I was someone who preferred wearing Superman/Batman tees to Wonder Woman tees. Today, I am glad that Wonder Woman is not just an epic win for DC it is also the first female-directed, female lead superhero movie that every comicbook fan had been waiting for aeons. It's success marks the confidence of female-lead movies in a skeptic, masculine-lead Hollywood. It also ups the ante for superhero 'solo' movies. Whether it was planned or not, just like the post's banner says ""Justice Begins With Her"", Wonder Woman proves to be the one who should lead the upcoming Justice League movie. Warner Bros might want to put their merchandize-selling, flying rodent-suited mascot on the back burner for their next outing.All said and done, I hope DC and WB doesn't become all smug with one blockbuster in the pockets and continue its race with Marvel. So yea, let's trash DC if they follow this good movie up with more loud, mediocre, CGI-heavy movies.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

DC movies really are modern mythology brought to life, aided by spectacular action visuals, coupled with epic music, these are the best movie experiences that the modern superhero genre has to offer.This latest DC movie, Wonder Woman, keeps up with the exceptional quality of the preceding DC movies in all aspects. Wonder Woman's spectacular action scenes look and feel very much like the ones we've seen in Man of Steel & Batman V Superman - director Patty Jenkins impressively managed to maintain the same action style as action-genius director Zack Snyder did with his films. Wonder Woman's musical score achieves a similar beautiful, epic quality to the work of previous DC musical master-class level movie composers, Hans Zimmer, Junkie XL, etc.I am thankful for DC movies taking themselves seriously and elevating themselves within a genre that can tend to be content with being merely shallow fluff entertainment. Wonder Woman, along with DC's other movies, prove that you can fully commit to bringing modern epics to life on screen.","10 out of 28 found this helpful.

At the start, you get back story of her and the world the universe is in but if you are a good listener and use logic, you will know something is amiss and you get frustrated at Diana for not figuring it out for herself, this casts a bad shadow over the rest of the film in my opinion as I had that as a constant nagging thought. Which also ruined the 'plot twist'.The cinematography for the action was the main good thing for me. They slowed it down so you can see the punches make contact and it isn't flurried random action. However, the permanent gray filter after leaving the Amazonians Island can make it difficult to see at times. However, I have one major complaint in relation to the action. You see people get shot and stabbed but there is no blood whatsoever. People are mortally wounded and killed by guns but there is no wounds or blood. Diana tries to put pressure on a wound of a friend that doesn't exist and when she removes her hand it isn't bloodied.This issue makes the film extremely unrealistic despite it trying to be gritty and realistic.Also, it isn't reassuring that at my screening, people were not laughing at the 'comedy moments'(which if you like cringey awkward misunderstanding humour you will love it) but they were instead laughing at what were meant to be serious scenes. Besides the action scenes, it was just okay. I personally did not end up invested in the romance or any of the characters and it wasn't funny when it was trying to be. Just go watch Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2.","12 out of 26 found this helpful.

It's the best reviewed DC universe movie of them all and rightly so ‚Äì since it's the best. In fact, I'd put it up there just below the Nolan Batman Trilogy. It's that good. First, the casting. All the main players and the minors are very good in their role. But Gal Gadot brings Princess Diana to life. She is at once a warrior, an innocent, full of heart and amazement. Her action scenes whether it's lasso, sword and shield or fists are great. She is one of the best representations of a superhero on film ever. Patty Jenkins has done a superb job bringing this movie to life. Chris Pine and Gal have great chemistry together. And Lucy Davis as Etta Candy is really fun. Can't have a Wonder Woman film without her sidekick. The story flows organically and moves very nicely. The editing is great and the WW1 sets are breath taking. Really, really great set design. But in the end, like any Superhero movie, it's the main character that carries it. Gal brings a sincerity and believability to the role and makes it hers. I'm already looking forward to WW2. Cheetah maybe?","10 out of 28 found this helpful.

This film proved them wrong.Is there anything more inspiring and beautiful than the sequence of Diana fighting her way across No Man's Land?Though I did think this particular film had room to grow from a feminist perspective, I loved it none the less. The fact that the Amazons wore stupid wedge heels was frustrating and distracting as hell, seeing as heels of such a height and shape weren't even invented for centuries after they would have been sealed away on the island--not to mention the lack of female inclusion after she left the island. But I digress.The acting is great, the story fairly solid.The CGI is not as good as it could have been and I'm personally rather mad they went with the New52 origin for Wonder Woman rather than sticking to the original, BETTER origin of her being molded from clay, but that was DC's mistake long before this movie came along.This film really brought a much higher standard to the DCEU that, unfortunately, they've haven't ever met again.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The acting was a bit flat, the villain was confusing, and the CGI looked weird. But despite these flaws, it was pretty good overall - an enjoyable super hero movie. It had lots of good fighting scenes.Diana's one dimensional acting early in the movie is actually something I excused since it made sense given the character's sheltered upbringing. She begins the movie seeing things in black and white and ends up having a more nuanced perspective late in the film after she learns about humanity. Gadot's acting seemed less wooden later in the film to reflect this.The pairing of Diana and Steve is fantastic. Unlike other super hero movies taking a stab at feminism where the woman is portrayed as the only person powerful enough to take on the villain (Captain Marvel comes to mind), you get the sense that Diana and Steve need each other. Diana views the world in black and white. She needs Steve to bring her down to earth and make hard decisions. And despite being a god, there are still times her power isn't enough and Steve helps her finish the bad guys off. Steve feels powerless against the Germans (the main antagonists early in the film) and needs Diana's sheer power as a god tasked with protecting humanity to push him further. They complement each other.Speaking of feminism, Diana is constantly portrayed as more emotional than the male characters she fights alongside. They try to silence her and tell her it's not worth doing something. But, she ends up showing how emotion can be used as strength, notably in a great scene where she rushes into the battlefield taking on the Germans alone, inspiring the men to follow her.I view this movie not as some artistic masterpiece but instead as a great first attempt at tackling feminism in action movies. And, in that particular role, it does an absolutely fantastic job.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I especially like what director Patty Jenkins did with this movie in its writing and direction, along with giving the feel of World War One.Gal Gadot was great as Diana/Wonder Woman; I like how she learns about our customs or how we work together, and I like her determination to stop the war, or the god of war named Ares. She looks good in the outfit, and she is cool once she fights against Germans during the war, or when fighting Ares himself in the big third act climax. I also liked Chris Pine as Steve Trevor; I liked him and Diana's relationship as they work together throughout the movie while also talking about is really to blame for war.The action scenes are cool and fun, and sometimes there are cool slow-motion shots during them. But some of the CG effects can be noticeable, especially during the last third of the movie in a big final fight with Ares. The look of the island Themyscira was pretty to look at with the nice visuals and cinematography, with an invisible barrier to hide the island that looks cool.One issue I have is with the reveal of the god of war Ares in the third act, it was a bit disappointing in a way for me knowing who the villain is, and they the look to him was not convincing at times because of the CGI effects on him. But mostly it is because of his design I did not like, which made it dissatisfying to see him, but I will say the way his plan plays out was a clever idea and I liked how he puts ideas in people's heads, but they still choose to go through with the idea.I like how they make Wonder Woman look like a symbol of hope in a way for the war, and how the soldiers she fought beside her act like real people who have their own talents outside of the war. The movie Wonder Woman (2017) is what I want other DC movies to be like, because it shows how she helps stop a war, her relationship with Steve Trevor, and how she becomes a hero in a lot of people's eyes.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I cannot thank Patty Jenkins enough for doing right by this film. As a child, I escaped a lot into the world of comics and always sought female superheroes, and Wonder Woman was by far my favorite. In this film, Jenkins has perfectly captured the fierceness and fighting skills of Wonder Woman without losing the heart and compassion of Diana... and Gal Gadot was the perfect actress to pull off the entire skill set.From the opening scenes in Themyscira to the final moments, I was completely engrossed by the story line and action. Neilson and Wright are flawlessly cast as the Amazon Queen and her General, and all of the girls had obviously worked hard to make the Amazon scenes very believable.I thought Jenkins vision of Wonder Woman was spot on and the Gadot executed her beautifully. Sure she is na√Øve and idealistic, but she's never seen war, poverty, disease, hunger, etc. I truly do not get the criticism of Gadot's acting. She comes across stoic and regal as Diana; seriously, who wants an overacted Diana Prince? She is socially awkward in London, but she's in a society so different from her own. I honestly cannot imagine her playing Diana any other way. And I love her relationship with Pine; it deepens so organically and never seems forced.Finally, I truly love the moment Diana finally steps up to take on the mantle of Wonder Woman. It is a magical moment in the film and it moves me to goosebumps and tears every time I watch it.

The fact that the hero in this movie is a female, which is not the case in most heroic movies, is a huge part of what made this movie so intriguing. DC has provided one of the best movies that they've made so far, and here's a few reasons why. The acting of Gal Gadot was already previously recognized in other films. The action scenes were spread throughout the movie very evenly. The small comedic moments were placed throughout the movie very efficiently such as the scene of Wonder Woman and the soldier in the boat. Another comedic scene was when she needed a new outfit and proceeded to carry her shield and sword out of the building while in civil attire. The only flaw I would say there was in the plot line was the fact that Wonder Woman's, ""hidden home"" was so easy to stumble upon. What compelled the enemy soldiers to head in that direction which happened to be her home? Wasn't her home superbly hidden by the Gods? Wonder Woman brought in history throughout a lot of the movie. The scene where Chief explains how Trevor's people killed off most of his people is a prime example of the history that was included. The movie even included the element of romance as well. Chris Pine was a wonderful pair with Gal Gadot as her lover in the movie. Not only that, but Pine's character Steve Trevor made a great addition to Diana Prince in battle. The two of them brought the movie comedy, action, and love. The setting of the movie was also very well complemented by the London setting and the torn down city of London. In the scene where Diana, and Steve entered London, it showed an aerial view of the city which looked wonderful in my opinion. The movie incorporated the differences between Diana's home and the real world during the 1900s which added to the movie. The production of Wonder Woman is one of DC's greatest works as I said before. Patty Jenkins and the cast did a wonderful job on directing and creating this production.","7 out of 18 found this helpful.

A couple of small, but kind of big things that I would have done different, but then isn't there always. Nothing that ruined it for me. My conditional acceptance of Gal Gadot was completed, not during the action scenes or dialogue or acting per se, but surprisingly, even to me, it was when Gal Gadot had this really big sweet sincere heartwarming genuine smile.

It's honestly the best D.C. Cinematic Universe movie, but then again, the other movies were pretty bad or disappointing. However, that doesn't take anything away from this movie, which is actually not only slightly better, but blows them out of the water in terms of quality.The strength of ""Wonder Woman"" is Patty Jenkins' direction. She really knows how to make this world work and has a great sense of the character. She directs fight scenes that are not only visually stunning, but progress the story in a way that hasn't been done before in the DCCU. Setting the film during The Great War allows her to play around with gender norms and defy expectations, which plays into the humor and adds another level of appreciation of how far we've come. However, as great as she is, I think the movie could have been cut down as it does go on a bit too long. Plus the reveal of the villain at the end is kind of underwhelming and underdeveloped. But that doesn't take away from the fact that she made a movie that has edge of your seat action, well thought out main characters, and is a fun ride for the most part.Wonder Woman played by Gal Gadot is great casting as she really does look the part. She looks so awesome in her costume and comes off as a very capable and strong individual that can beat anyone. I do feel that her line delivery though is hit or miss as they border on well acted to cringey. Chris Pine is perfect as a supporting character as he's charming and charismatic. And he's very capable even though he's fighting alongside Wonder Woman, who really doesn't need his help. The two characters paired have a good dynamic and Pine manages to hide some of Gadot's weaknesses, when they're on screen together. The rest of the cast is fine, but forgettable. They serve their purpose and move the plot forward.Overall, ""Wonder Woman"" is a fun ride and the best DCCU movie we've gotten yet. It's really well directed, the actors and character are enjoyable, the action and visuals are stellar, and the score is fantastic. Yes there are problems here and there, but they don't take away from a competently made film. It gives me hope that D.C. is heading in the right direction and can make more good movies in the future that can finally give the fans what they deserve from these characters. I give it 4/5Check Out More Reviews @ theconnoisseurreviews.tumblr.com","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

It's an origin story starring Gal Gadot as the titular character (a role she previously played in last year's 'BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE'). In this film she's an Amazon princess (in the year 1918) that aids an American pilot who crash lands on her home island of Themyscira (a place only inhabited by Amazonian women). She helps him try to stop the German Empire, from conquering the world during World War I, and she must leave her home for the first time in order to do so; by traveling with the pilot to London (where she becomes Wonder Woman for the first time). The film costars Chris Pine, Connie Nielson, Robin Wright, David Thewlis, Danny Huston and Elena Anaya. It was directed by Patty Jenkins (who also helmed the 2003 critically acclaimed female serial killer flick 'MONSTER') and it was written by Allan Heinberg, Zack Snyder (who also co-produced the movie) and Jason Fuchs. The blockbuster was made on a budget of $149 million, and it's the first summer tent pole superhero film directed by a woman. It's also received nearly unanimous rave reviews from critics, it was voted the most anticipated summer blockbuster of 2017 as well (in a recent pole), and it's exceeded all expectations at the Box Office (including becoming the biggest opening weekend ever for a film directed by a woman). I think it's one of the best superhero movies ever made.The story begins in modern day, with Wonder Woman (Gadot) recollecting on her past as a young Amazonian princess named Diana (Emily Carey). Diana is taught to be a powerful warrior, in case the God of War ever returns to the hidden island they live on. A United States Army Air Service Captain, named Steve Trevor (Pine), crash lands on their island and is being pursued by German military forces. After stopping the attacking soldiers, the Amazonian people interrogate Steve. They then learn about the war, and the threat it poses to the entire planet. Diana feels that it's her duty to go with Steve, and defeat the God of War (if she can find him).The film is a heck of a lot of fun; it's action-packed and the 'fish out of water' comedy scenes are hilariously classic (they're really well done). The movie is also surprisingly emotional, I even cried a little towards the end of the film. They couldn't have found a better director than Jenkins to direct this movie too. She really knows the character well, and she has a lot of passion for telling her story obviously. They couldn't have cast a better actress than Gadot in the title role either. She's perfect as Wonder Woman, and I think she gives the best performance of the year (so far). She's definitely a huge movie star waiting to happen; she's breathtakingly gorgeous and amazingly talented as well. I'm amazed at how much I actually love this film (I wasn't even excited to see it until recently too). It really blew me away, and I'm really happy with the progress it's helped advance for women in film!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://vimeo.com/221789603","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

Comics movie franchise, Wonder Woman, benefits from a lot of good choices. First, the choice of Gal Gadot, a former member of the Israeli army, as the lead character. She's a martial artist. She's 5'10"" and a former fashion model who has great looks along with her athletic skills. She was born to play this role. Another excellent choice was the female director, Patty Jenkins. She portrays Wonder Woman as a ""feminine feminist"". Our hero is equal to any man in the movie but it's a subtle portrayal that doesn't beat you over the head. She's simply a strong woman. In Wonder Woman, Diana/Wonder Woman is introduced as a young girl who starts early with her training as a defender of the all female island she was placed on, with an entire tribe of Amazonian women, by the gods. She becomes the best of the best after her years of combat training; surpassing even her teacher in her skills.On the secluded island she had never seen a man before, until Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) drops in after his plane is shot down by German soldiers. When he tells her of the conflict that's killing thousands of people in the outside world (World War I) she decides, against her mother's wishes, that she must do something to help. So, together the two leave the island for a world that Diana knows nothing about and there are some hilarious situations that occur from her innocence with civilization in 1919 England. While the movie is both funny and romantic, it's strongest element is its action scenes. Once Wonder Woman gets to fighting, forget about it, you can't take your eyes off of her up on the screen. The movie is a bit long (two hours and twenty one minutes) but I never noticed the length. There was plenty of excitement to keep you enthralled for every minute of the film.Wonder Woman will reprise her role for (at least) two editions of The Justice League (which will also include more D.C. superheroes such as Batman, Superman and The Flash) and I'd bet on another Wonder Woman solo project as well. I thought Wonder Woman was wonderful! The movie is rated PG-13 and on my ""Hollywood Popcorn Scale"" I rate it a JUMBO (with extra butter), my highest rating.Hollywood Hernandez","9 out of 26 found this helpful.

As a fan of the comics and original 70s TV series I thought can gal gadot equal or better Linda carter(currenty in Supergirl). Well I can honestly say she does. Where Cavill and Routh could not match christoher Reeve as superman and affleck yet to surpass both bale and Keaton as Bruce Wayne aka Batman. I said before I saw this that I hope it didn't disappoint like the previous 3 DCEU movies which where OK but the trailers made them look awesome. I said to myself if this is not as good as the flash from TV then forget. The chemistry between gadot and pine is perfect and the supporting cast holds up the story. What I liked about this film is although she has superpowers as such it felt more like a grounded non powered universe more like arrow but the fight scenes were much more superior. I wont say to much but if you felt let down by previous movies in dc then this will restore your faith. Amazing movie.","9 out of 26 found this helpful.

In a huge burst of superhero fervor that's lasted for decades it's the first time since Elecktra that a superheroine has had her own movie and it's the first time since Punisher: War Zone that a woman has directed a superhero movie. Combine that with the fact that it's the first superhero movie starring a woman to be directed by a woman AND the fact that despite being an iconic and beloved superheroine it's the first time that a live-action Wonder Woman has made it to the big screen you have a movie burdened down under the weight of some heavy firsts. The good news is that even among so many game changing stats Wonder Woman holds it own simply as a movie. I love action movies but I don't go to too many. Simple fact being that between the cheesy, often lazy dialogue, the blurred action scenes that go by way too quickly to even understand what's going on and the terrible to non- existent characterization, it's often not worth the price of the ticket. But Wonder Woman has a great script and is lovingly directed by Patty Jenkins. This may only be her second feature film but Jenkins has spent the time between this and her 2003 debut film Monster handling big budget TV pilots and cutting her teeth behind the scenes on small studio shorts to test whether she was superhero director material. Is she ever! Wonder Woman is a introduction to WW the character and, aside from two clumsy bookends, pretty manages to stand on its own as a movie. It tells the tale about how Diana, princess of Themyscira, grows up on an all female matriarchy. Sheltered by her mother, the adventurous Diana defies her orders and trains as a warrior under the guidance of her aunt. Her peaceful existence grinds to a halt one day when Steve Trevor crashlands in the waters of the island. After she rescues him and ascertains he's a man, the island is attacked by WWI German soldiers who bring with them guns, which the Amazons have never seen before. Horrified by the consequences of this weapon Diana decides to go with Steve to do what she was trained to do and stop the war, reclaiming peace and love for mankind. That's the gist of the plot, which doesn't sound that great when I put it down in writing. Trust me when I say that the world building and characterization really amp up the value of this simple story. I had my doubts about Gal Gadot, who plays our titular Wonder Woman, but she truly steps up to the plate and inhabits the role with oodles of charm and grit. This is a Diana who is naive but not stupid, kind hearted but determined, who is willing to go the extra mile and do the right thing because that's what she believes in. The other characters are really wonderful and charming too. Chris Pine is given a lot to do as Steve Trevor but he is a good and ultimately supporting player to Diana. Lucy Davis kills in a tiny role as Etta Candy, Steve's secretary. Out of all the Amazons Robin Wright really sticks out as a fierce warrior who is clearly having the time of her life in a really epic battle scene that I wish had gone on even longer! Trevor's crew of misfits, despite being given little screen time also have their own unique traits and values and Jenkins, the actors, and the screenwriters succeed in making you care for them over their short amount of screen time. Ultimately while this film is about two and a half hours long the time just flies by. It's elegantly paced, and if anything could have done with an extra half hour to fully flesh out the end. I gave it an 8 as a rating, rounded up from what would be a 7.5 if IMDb allowed half stars. Why not higher when I'm full of praise? Ultimately though the film is charming there are some bones to pick here and there with the film. Nothing that detracts from it being an overall great experience, but not enough to boost it to a higher score. And ultimately, as fun and as charming as the film is, it doesn't really do anything to reinvent the wheel. It is a simple story beautifully told. It's just a pity that more action films aren't able to meet the bar of being decent. Definitely give this one a watch.

To add to that, it was irritating to many, myself included, that from the trio of the Trinity of the Justice League ,Batman and Superman had already dozens of films and series dedicated to them ,but perhaps the most famous super-heroine in history lacked the same level of screen time ,until now!To the film itself, is the origins story of Diana for Themyscira to the trenches of the First World War, as she goes in order to end it as soon as possible. Accompanied her is Steve Roger eh Trevor who acts both as her guide and tutor for the world outside the domain of the Amazons. To the Princess of Themyscira herself Gal Gadot was excellent in her role not just playing but been this Amazon ,strong ,decisive, ready for fight at any time ,but at the same time showing how outside of the world she is, but always willing to learn new things for it ,from the nationalities to dancing(!). Chris Pine after finishing traveling around in the Enterprise, was the right mix of comedy and sidekick to Diana ,more or less reacting in a normal manner to these ex-ordinary events. To his credit ,we don't crash land in a island full of Amazons using swords, bows and arrows and wearing tunics everyday. And the support crew played their part and delivered with great quotes and well placed action and comedic wits!To the crew I glad that the men in the film weren't all of the douses (with the team of Trevor been the best example) ,unlike with previous women leading films. As for the actions ,godness was directed excellently and at any time I understood were each character was or what was doing. Over all what we want from Man of Steel ,Batman vs Superman and Suiside Squad ,it was fulfilled here. Ah and color ,a lot of color, made the watching so much more entertaining! And as for the setting ,I was worried how a 100% good character would be in a war in which wasn't any good or bad ,only gray and mud and morally questionable tactics. But my fears were subdued as the director's team find the solution and worked out in the end. However I have to say I have some nit-pitch. Firstly it seems to have ""borrowed"" plot elements from Captain America the First Avenger, just saying. Some clich√©s weren't avoided, but were used cleverly I might say. But the biggest issues were the villains. In all honesty the antagonists were a bit generic (war-monder and mad scientist) and a small plot twist (no spoilers) which has become a bit of an issues to superhero movies for since Captain America the Winter Soldier we haven't seen yet a truly awesome villain. By the way they were quit inaccurate with the portrait of general Lunderdorf, but I am not to bug about it ,as this a superhero film not a historical one .Over all this one of the best origin story for a super-hero film and I proudly put it along side Kill Bill, Aliens, Terminator 2 and Mad Max Fury Road as great action film with females in the leading roles, girls this is the film you were waiting to add to that collection. Addictionally I am glad that women now have in public a symbol of feminism and fight to the rights of women , taking the big screen treatment!! And DC ,it took long enough.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

"9","/10","Worth waiting for (Godot)","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3736650/?ref_=tt_urv","pyrocitor","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur3728510/?ref_=tt_urv","22 June 2017","In 2015, the post-credits zinger for Marvel's Ant-Man had Evangeline Lily's heroine, the Wasp, promised her own super suit. Her retort: ""It's about damn time."" The world echoed her sentiments. And waited. But alas: you snooze you lose, Marvel. Wonder Woman is here, loud, proud, heartfelt, and almost absurdly fun. Not to mention: in the super-super-saturated cinemas of late, it's the first female-led superhero film in 13(?!) years? Suddenly Wasp's pithy barb feels like the understatement of the century. If we're going to continue to play the Marvel card (and we should, for Wonder Woman is more akin to the MCU's bright, mischievously fun fare than any of its sombre, melodramatic, ludicrously unironic DC precedents), director Patty Jenkins magpies the best bits of Captain America and Thor into a robustly satisfying romp. It's a lot to juggle, simultaneously sating the twin bastions of feminism and fun in the rare superhero film expected to be About Something, but Jenkins, drawing upon nearly 80 years of fandom and iconography, is rightly confident. Her social commentary streak is as hearty as her flair for fun, and she gamely plunges into the film's WWI setting as a potent vehicle for one of the genre's most potent explorations of the ethics of action combat. Jenkins juxtaposing the sparking, saturated sapphire colour scheme of Diana's Amazon island with the sepia soot on the war-torn outside world (and just when we'd been enjoying a welcome break from the gloomy DC greys¬Ö sigh) succinctly feeds into Diana's indictment of human cruelty. A superhero film sincere enough to advocate for empathy and benevolent compassion instead of revenge, justice, or simply violence? It's a core moral streak so puppy-eyed and earnest it would verge on cornball were it not sold with a ferocious fervour heartfelt enough to trigger twinges of guilty reflection in between bites of popcorn. And that's nothing to sneeze at. But, paradoxically, in spite of this effective call for compassion¬Ö there's almost never been a movie where watching someone punch things has felt so goddamn awesome. Jenkins uncorks action interludes with a zippy abandon, as balletic as they are concussively cathartic, so stupendously fun that you shouldn't be surprised to see audience members unconsciously swept to their feet with the infectious, heady momentum (Robin Wright, in particular, nearly steals the show with a functional cameo just by making ass-kicking in a leather miniskirt look so ferociously cool). Paired with the crisply perfect period wartime d√©cor, and especially when accompanied by her exhilarating and impossibly catchy guitar riff, Wonder Woman is the first superhero film in years where the fight scenes, rather than merely pleasant diversions, are moving, almost overwhelmingly endorphin-flooding experiences. The mere memory of Diana crumbling a clock tower or flattening a roof with single blows, or granted her very own √âowyn moment by storming into no man's land (get it?) is enough to bring shivers of magnificence.And that's when the shoe drops, and the 'women only Texas screening'-shaped elephant in the room rears its head: we've had decades for the exuberance of men hitting things to wear off. Wonder Woman reminds us of how much fun it can be to watch WOMEN hitting things, and how desperately rare it is. Mercilessly scrutinized under the gender policing microscope, Jenkins, cannily, doesn't oversell her gender politics. Instead, she calmly naturalizes them by steering the film through Diana's headstrong, take-no-sh*t character, with each feminist beat emerging naturally through her personality. It's oodles more effective than any polarizing, dogmatic diatribe, and yields many of the film's moments of sneaky humour. One aside in particular, where an exasperated Diana condemns petticoats and skirts for impeding high-kicks, instantly cements itself as an iconic reprieve of solidarity for women's dressing rooms for the next century. Still, a Wonder Woman film would be moot without the right Gal in the lead. Here, it's indisputably clear that it's been worth waiting for Godot. Anchored by a tempestuous, fiery charisma, Godot's remarkable performance is just as unforgettable in her small moments of zealous humanity (her almost childlike indignation at a war counsel willing to abandon soldiers as a strategic coup, or equivalent jubilation when tasting ice cream for the first time) as she is fiercely convincing tossing tanks or bridling enemies with a glowing lasso. Supporting her, Chris Pine is at his most disarmingly hysterical and irreverently lovable here, and provides a welcome anchoring of incredulous realism when the film threatens to topple into being too steeped in mythology. Danny Huston's Red Skull clone hits all the requisite skulking, ominously pontificating adversarial notes, but he's nowhere near as interesting as Elena Anayu's luridly sinister and tragic Dr. Poison, who, disappointingly, is relegated to sidekick status. Thankfully, Diana's remarkably diverse cabal of 'Howling Commandos' pals remain on the right side of fun without overstaying their welcome (though Ewen Bremner is just one bug-eyed nibble of haggis away from belonging in a live action cartoon). Finally, David Thewlis' droll prissiness perfectly befits Diana's befuddled ambassador to the human world, even if his range isn't quite up for the challenge plot twists demand of him. Wonder Woman isn't perfect ‚Äì there are expanses when Jenkins' juggernaut pacing fumbles (especially an overlong expository origin governed by an overbearingly dour Connie Nielsen), and it toes the line of being a touch too derivative, leaning on its superhero predecessors so liberally that key emotional moments threaten to belly flop from over-familiarity. Still, it's only a fleeting wobble of tentativeness and creative laziness, that only serves to reinforce Robin Wright's advice: Wonder Woman is at its (/her) best when she truly believes in herself. Still, when Godot is armoured up, flashing her gauntlets and kicking through walls, the film achieves an almost peerless sense of infectious awesomeness. Will its legacy abide? Well, I'll let the waves of young girls (and boys!) jump-kicking and slamming their forearms together when stampeding out of the auditorium of my screening speak for themselves. -9/10","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Batman vs Superman was just an average flick, and the suicide squad was way worse. DC has became an desert for the fans last year but this year they found the biggest oasis that build up hope on the upcoming blockbusters. Wonder Woman has a well managed story, screenplay, casting and more importantly no ruining moments like the Martha scene from Batman vs Superman. The movie was so good that at some point you get to think that the whole story of Ares was just a myth and would be thinking what would happen next as wonder woman lost her belief on the humans. And then comes the god of war. The whole action sequence was so damn good and the end where she gets to remember Steve's words. Those words were fab. Gal Gadot answers to everyone by her action & glamour, who initially thought she would be a bad choice for Wonder Woman. Chris pine was so good, he made justice to Steve's role. Ares was so good until he takes his helmet off :D. And lastly we should not forget the director for making it straight, simple and elegant.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

Best movie DC has made since The Dark Knight (yes better than the Dark Knight Rises, and Batman Begins now that I think on it) The characters were extremely well done. I cannot give Gal Gadot enough praise for her performance as Diana/ Wonder Woman, giving ever moment of character development justice as well as showing a range of emotional acting skill while being a completely convincing bad-ass. Chris Pine as well did a fantastic job in his role, and shows off a good bit of range himself while he's at it.It's tone is great (and varied), It's pacing was spot on. My worry was in it's action and I can happily say that it is as amazing and epic as you could hope for, and well edited and shot to boot! My only issue is to nitpick at the slow mo at times. It wasn't ever out of place, but it did feel a little overused. Thats a nitpick at best though. Characters, motivations, tone, theme, and action is all extremely well done.Easily the best movie so far in the D.C.E.U. I'm fully excited for what they do with Wonder Woman next. Here's to a great movie and, hopefully, a turning point for D.C. Wonder Woman was truly wonderful (sue me) and I highly recommend it. My little sister, Marisa, will never see super heroes the same, and I'm glad for it.","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

From story line to acting and directing this film was perfectly executed. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine give stellar performances in this entertaining film. At the outset we see a world of gods and legend that coincides with the world we know. The film beautifully merges these two worlds in a way that makes it realistic and plausible. The story of Aries and his existence is well woven in the film and it pulls off a nice twist that explains him being the dark force behind war. Gal Gadot is excellent as Wonder Woman and brings back to life a heroine that has been absent for some time and buried under numerous superhero films. This film has its moments and does a marvelous job in living up to those moments accompanied by the right music. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine did an excellent job in bringing these moments to life. Thankfully an unnecessary and fully fledged romance was not used. It is as if Wonder Women exists firmly in its own universe and nicely executes its story without too much attention to other films or even a franchise, it exists in its own right. Perhaps that is a successful strategy in making films that are part of a series.When this film was first announced I was unsure about how it would perform. Batman vs Superman was a disappointment for many fans. We also had Wonder Woman in this film who seemed mysterious and possessed powers and tools most were unfamiliar with. Her fighting scenes left many asking how questions. This film explains this somewhat forgotten heroine with clarity. It is easily the most successful installment in the DC franchise. Thankfully Zac Synder was not the director and it shows because this was a very well made film. He should be prevented from making others and other directors should take the lead. Overall Wonder Woman has the right amount of intrigue, depth and uniqueness to make it a memorable superhero film. It should very well go down as one of the best Superhero films made in recent times.8.5/10","5 out of 12 found this helpful.

I thought it was pretty good, but I didn't think it was great. It didn't ""Wow"" me...I would however,recommend it and give it a thumbs up...I know some will disagree with me.I think the two best things about the film were: 1 - Gal Gadot nailed it as Wonder Woman. Fine acting, fine look and fine physicality (When it's not a CGI Wonder Woman leaping around). She was clearly the best thing in that Superman/Batman train wreck movie and pretty much carries this movie and franchise squarely on her shoulders. 2 - All of the scenes featuring Diana's naive and humorous interactions with the civilized world. Welcome light moments in the very dark DC movie universe.I also like the vibe that they really tried to make a good Wonder Woman movie and not hack out the same old usual dreck (And succeeded most of the time).What I didn't like... - I liked the parts better than the sum of the whole (The same way I feel about movies like ""Remo Williams"")...I just really didn't care much about the Ares super villain story line, I was more interested in her dealing with the horrors of WWI. That was a more interesting movie to me. The whole Ares thing just seemed ""standard"" and lackluster and the only thing missing was some magic orb!. - While I liked some of the action, I felt that the bad camera work and uber hyper editing during the action scenes, deterred from some solid choreography. When are these people going to learn how to shoot and edit action, so that people can see, comprehend and enjoy it, instead of being visually assaulted!Overall, I liked it, I liked Gadot, it will make many quatloos and the franchise will move forward.. I'm just glad it wasn't a Marvel movie, otherwise Stan Lee would have shown up somewhere as a German soldier or a baggage handler.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Gal Gadot and Chris Pine were really good together. They both have charisma and chemistry.There was plenty of action just in the war scenes from WWl. At the end, it got loud with Wonder Woman battling Ares (an evil God).I am glad that they didn't overdo the destruction scenes. The theater I watched this at had the sound on very loud and it was deafening. If there had been a lot of these scenes, I would not have liked the movie at all. In fact, I probably will not go see Justice League because there are too many super heroes which means there will be too many super villains. I grew up reading Superman and other DC comics back in the 60s. Today's super heroes are not as exciting. But Wonder Woman has brought back the kind of super hero I used to love.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

All the actors put up a fine display but are finally destined to play second fiddle as the show belongs to 'Wonder Woman' and Gal Gadot does a 'wonder job' of it. The transition of Diana, Princess of Themyscira, Daughter of Hippolyta to a WW1 ravaged London is convincing. However, more convincing is the fact that this demi-goddess connects with the audience not only her action but her display of emotions. A wonderful effort by the production team and I hope an independent sequel is considered staged in 'present day' instead of reserving Wonder Woman to only play a part of the Justice League.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

"8","/10","No matter how you slice it, ""Wonder Woman"" draws its strength from its ladies","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3727294/?ref_=tt_urv","Movie_Muse_Reviews","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2496397/?ref_=tt_urv","9 June 2017","DC Entertainment needed a superhero hit badly, and what better way to make a comeback than with a female heroine? Maybe ""Wonder Woman"" should be evaluated apart from its exciting feminist energy, but in a prolific superhero movie landscape, individuality matters, and the female star-director duo of Gal Gadot and Patty Jenkins is a large part of what makes ""Wonder Woman"" stand out.Aside from the very obvious, however, nothing groundbreaking is at play here in this movie in terms of its genre and storytelling. Even its wartime period setting (""Captain America: The First Avenger"") and mix of mythology and the real world (""Thor"") have been done before. Diana (Gadot) exhibits similar traits to the optimism and principled nature of Captain America and the joie de vivre and brazenness of Thor. So if ""Wonder Woman"" feels fresh at all, you have to strongly consider the impact of the feminine factor.What's great about Diana in this film is that she doesn't fit in a box and she can't be told what to do. Gadot exhibits a subtle but definitive confidence with the ability to step back for lighter moments and forward when we need to connect with the ferocity of her feelings and beliefs. Screenwrtier Allan Heinberg, whose credits include a number of female-driven TV shows, does his best work giving Gadot opportunities to display Diana's personality, and the way her sex factors into this World War I setting is forthright but not overbearing.The script's only other strength is in delivering a message about war and love and humanity's capacity for good and evil. Superhero films and similar genres have treaded in this territory plenty of times, but Diana's journey to her epiphany is well-realized. The rest of the story, however, leans too much on formula and clich√©. In fact, aside from Robin Wright and a solid enough beach battle, ""Wonder Woman"" is a pretty terrible movie until Diana leaves her home on the island of Themyscira. She's just another rebellious hero with a destiny who wants to defy a parent and leave her home. Some of the film's distractingly poor CGI shots (like young Diana jumping off a cliff) don't help. It also takes about halfway through the movie to adjust and accept Jenkins' reliance on slow-motion and computer- driven action shots and appreciate the heavy stylization. Once Diana sets sail with Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), a spy for the British who washed up on her island and told her of the ""war to end all wars"" that she feels destined to end, ""Wonder Woman"" begins a gradual but sure-footed ascent toward quality. The initial boat scene, in which she turns Trevor into a bumbling fool with her confidence and poise, hints at the character development to come.The prevailing tone and sentiment of ""Wonder Woman"" very closely echoes that first ""Captain America"" movie, which was extremely solid, so even though it doesn't transcend it, it's a fair and positive comparison, better even for those who haven't seen that movie. Both heroes discover the positive impact that one gifted individual can have on the world (with the right team), which in ""Wonder Woman"" comes in the form of a pretty unforgettable sequence between the trenches of the Western front.Like many of the ensuing scenes, this ""No Man's Land"" sequence isn't mind-blowing, but everything that does happen from this point on is particularly attuned to Diana. Everything caters to her emotional journey and the place her worldview is meant to arrive, even if it isn't especially gripping, compelling or surprising.There's no better way to describe how Jenkins captures her star and main character other than inspiring. Although not immediately evident to this cisgender male reviewer, you can see the effect the film is having on women and girls and understand it. Although Gadot's hair is blowing about a lot and we get Diana in slow motion action poses, Jenkins ‚Äì whether because she's a woman herself or understands the sensitivities having a woman action star requires ‚Äì avoids over-sexualizing Gadot. The sexiness of Diana comes from her strength and confidence more than Gadot's physical attractiveness. The slow motion is about letting that sink in and inspire, not about ogling her. By the end, Diana's strength, intelligence and sexiness is only matched by her mindfulness and compassion, which we haven't seen to the same degree in Wonder Woman's male counterparts.I don't want to make ""Wonder Woman"" into a movie that's only about its hero's gender, but having seen enough superhero movies, so much of what sets ""Wonder Woman"" apart is the result of its female star and female director. After so many male-dominated superhero films, that perspective really makes a difference in carving out a space for ""Wonder Woman"" among its contemporaries.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The Amazons are a race of women placed on Earth by Zeus to instil love and hope into the hearts of mankind, but after a betrayal from Ares causes mankind to turn on itself, they secluded themselves from the outside world. Enter Steve Trevor who crash lands on the island during World War One, followed by his German pursuers, opening Diana's eyes to the outside world for the first time, and pitting her on a path to face Ares himself and stop the war to end all wars.As is becoming the running theme of the DCEU, and setting itself thematically apart from the MCU, Diana is a literal demi-goddess. Even at an early age she shows that she's more than just your regular Amazon. Even outside of Themyscira she shows that she's more than just a woman. She represents an ideal, she's a symbol of love and hope, and her quest to kill Ares is as symbolic as stopping the war itself - not just World War One, but all wars (of course, only to realise that that's just human nature).And yet Patty Jenkins very deliberately makes sure that this larger-than-life take on Wonder Woman doesn't run away with her. She grounds her and makes her relatable with a three-dimensional personality. Gal Gadot certainly lives up to the pressures the role demands of her. I was extremely skeptical of her casting (she wasn't even the best actor in the Fast & Furious franchise, which is saying a lot), and even BvS didn't really do enough to allay my fears. And yet here we are, and she is absolutely the best Wonder Woman we could have ever hoped for. She perfectly embodies Diana's charming naivety and innocence in this world that's completely new to her, and carefully ensures that Diana doesn't just appear dimwitted in the face of it all. Her reactions to seeing a baby and tasting ice cream for the first time are quintessentially endearing, and her complete disregard for societal expectations of women at the turn of the 20th century lends to a lot of comedy at humanity's expense rather than hers.Her relationship with Steve Trevor is also a big success of the movie, not shying away from the more romantic perspective of it, but also without making it a big focus. Gadot and Chris Pine share such a tantalising chemistry together that it makes Pine's unlikeliness to come back a real shame (the sequel is reportedly taking place in modern times, post-Justice League). Pine gives Trevor such a charming persona that its hard not to like him, even when he shows signs of an inflated ego. His interactions with Gadot's Diana are hugely entertaining to watch, whether they be for comedic, romantic, or dramatic purposes. Every line of dialogue between them feels natural and sticks the landing perfectly.Wonder Woman's visuals are a bit of a mixed bag across the board. There are some great visual treats to behold, particularly the recreation of Themyscira and Gadot's entire wardrobe department. Set-pieces and costumes are top-notch design work and all look great. However much of the CGI appears unfinished (and may explain Ares god-awful tin can appearance). Many of the backdrops in action sequences are green-screen, and it's plainly obvious, and many of the more outlandish stunts, as impressive as they are to watch, are almost entirely computer- generated. There's one moment early on when an Amazon dramatically swings down a cliff, but is shot by a German rifleman on the way down. It's great until she's hit by the bullet and suddenly it becomes obvious she was entirely computer-generated, with unnatural movements and reactions. The kicker is this sequence was completely unnecessary to CGI; they could've easily done it with a crane and stuntwoman instead, and kept far away from the uncanny valley being an issue.That said there are some bits of stuntwork that absolutely needed CGI to bring to life, and even without the fine tuning the effects needed, they still look hugely impressive. Wonder Woman is bristling with fantastic action sequences, the standout of which being her first big one as Wonder Woman, as she steps out into No Man's Land, takes everything the Germans have, and bursts through the trenches to get to a village on the other side, flipping tanks, demolishing church towers and liberating the village from it's German enslavers. Everything from the bullet-deflections, to her twirling and spinning in stylish choreography, to the brute force of tank-flipping looks great and is massively entertaining.Wonder Woman is not only the movie the DCEU needed, but also the movie Hollywood, and specifically big action blockbusters needed. It's strive for gender equality was pitch perfect, being as important behind the scenes as it was in front of the camera. It boasts the best Wonder Woman we could hope for, with a perfect performance from Gal Gadot and an equally as great performance from Chris Pine to bounce off. The action sequences are breathtaking and are certain to mark this movie out from the realm of superhero movies alone. But, and I must stress this, it's not perfect. It falters in the third act, Ares is a massive letdown of a beatstick (although the revelation of his identity is fantastic), and it doesn't give enough personality to it's lesser characters. I give Wonder Woman a high 8/10, letdown mostly by the awful presentation and appearance of Ares.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

However Gadot's charisma and genuineness shine through in an innocence that is captivating and unique. The motivation behind her Diana Prince is well thought out, believable, honorable and against the inspired background of WWI politically charged. Granted there's still some ropey CGI (which on these budgets is just lazy) and the running time is about 20 mins too long. But with a nye-on perfect cast (Pine is superb as an experienced foil for Gadot without trying to steal her limelight) and some great comedic moments (take note Zack Snyder) you have a formulaic blockbuster but one that more or less uses the positive ingredients of its predecessors and bins the bad ones.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

My expectations were high, but as great as the expectation the bigger is the disappointment.Wonder women is indeed A good movie, but it is extremely Overrated compering the film to the Dark Knight it is just injustice !! as far for the main star Gal Gadot's her acting was o.k, it is clear that she dose not have a lot of range like her co-stars and she was given very little dialogue,and when she spoke she sounded technical and emotionless, but she is grate with the physicality part cant take that away from her. Honestly,the film is Overrated, maybe is because gender issues i don't know they keep saying ""best film that was Directed by a woman"" don't really get that. The first and second set were nice, but in the third act starting being messy and boring. overall its a fun summer movie, not the best movie i have ever seen but good.","10 out of 22 found this helpful.

It surprised me because I expected to be disappointed since DC movies are usually pretty bad. Like Superman in Man Of Steel this main character, Wonderwoman, has a calm and innocence about her which is quite attractive. The plot has some small holes in it and it does jump forwards in time quite often but it's a popcorn action movie so that's fine. This is definitely one of the better DC universe movies in my opinion.

Diana Prince) gets her own live-action movie. There were reasons to worry. DCEU has had three chances and they blew each one, why would this be different? Well, it just is. They actually put their heart in this one.Even though this is coming from a person who liked all the previous DCEU movies (don't judge me), this is well worth your time. I didn't really find many big flaws and I'm aware of the flaws that the previous DCEU movies had. They just didn't bother me so much. The dialogues are fun and at times hilarious. Seriously, the first half is quite funny. But the too sudden tonal shift may bother some viewers a little because the first and the second half almost feel like two different movies. But they are both equally heartfelt and enjoyable. They just should have been put together a bit better. But it still works and delivers on the action, emotion and entertainment. Think first half Marvel, second half DC. But both at their best. The first half is funny, entertaining, mostly lighthearted and is a good set-up for what's to come. The second half goes a bit darker, but it's not Batman v Superman level of dark, there are still occasional bursts of happiness (there is one gorgeous dance scene). Still, even though it's dark, it's hopeful and gives a lot more depth to the movie with its themes. From a visual perspective, it's alright. The CGI could be better, but it's okay, some might be bothered by the overuse of slow motion, but I was cool with it. But, everyone who didn't like the bleak colors of the previous DCEU movies, than this is your cup of tea and it helps lift up the atmosphere into something more hopeful. Gal Gadot is beautiful, charismatic and perfect for Wonder Woman, she just felt so natural. And Chris Pine is at his best for now. Sometimes a great comic relief, sometimes just a very strong character. Another thing I really liked about this is how it shows tolerance. Usually with this kind of movie, you would expect massive feminism, looking at men from above etc. But this movie really doesn't do that. It's equal to everyone and that's one of the main reasons I love it. It shows tolerance.Overall, this is a very uplifting, entertaining and heartfelt film which was just what DC needed. Warner Bros. finally let things happen the way they should and it turned out wonderful.","9 out of 27 found this helpful.

The underlying theme that ""absolute good"" and ""absolute evil"" don't exist was beautifully weaved into a movie that had to be a little over commercialized in order to succeed. Speaking of things that had to be kept in order to please the masses, I love that the creators knew the original sexy costume (created by a man to sell comic books) had to be kept, but changed it so that Diana created & took complete ownership of it. It was her outfit to choose, not anyone else's to force on her. That coupled with the hilarious scenes showing the hypocritical over-sexualization of women/the Virgin Mary complex that society pushes made it one of the best super hero movies I've seen. Congrats to all involved including Patty Jenkins, the director, you made a character little girls will look up to for years to come. I can't wait for the future of cinema and all the progressive women and men involved.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

It shows how Diana adapts to the human world and how Diana became the Wonder Woman.The screenplay and cinematography enhances the perfection with which Patty Jenkins has directed the movie.Gal Gadot is the perfect Wonder Woman( not that Lynda Carter was bad), she has carried the whole thing on in spite of being 5 months pregnant, massive respect. Chris Pine was the best counter-part, although we had our doubts initially that he couldn't do any other role as good as James.T.Kirk in Star Trek. Kudos to the casting as every character has been used well and has a certain trait that is seen distinctively.Every dialogue in the movie had a deeper meaning and nothing was to fill the conversations. The movie had its light moments, opposed to how dark DC movies will be and it wasn't void of serious moments either. Just the theme music was enough to give goosebumps and it was beautifully shown how humans were seen from Diana's point of view and she still chose to help 'em.I couldn't help but notice how Wonder Woman was little parallel to Captain Steve Rogers with both carrying shields and having their time line from World War II to the present. Still no Marvel movie can come close to this SOLO female Superhero. We have all the rights to hope that the Justice League movie is going to be awesome.The movie is worth a lot of re-watches and did somebody notice Zack Snyder's cameo in the trenches? Neither did I.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

We get to see how she grows up, learn to fight and finally get a call to adventure by the arrival of Steve Trevor. In the other world - that of the First World War - Wonder Woman must overcome both physical and spiritual challenges to finally become the hero that we met in the Batman V Superman movie. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman fills out the hero's role in Joseph Campbell's old monomyth with charm, intelligence and spirit. The central premise of the character is a belief in the good in all humans (and amazons). This belief is what is challenged during the movie. Which sets Wonder Woman apart from most other superhero movies, where it's all about the hero himself and his bad temper (Thor, Hulk), self worth (Batman Begins), health (Iron Man), inheritance (Man of Steel), love life (Spider-Man) and so forth. Even Captain America (First Avenger) is mostly about his belief in himself. Somehow everything else also works perfectly in this movie: Great locations (Italy for Themyscira, London as 1918 London), great supporting cast (Chris Pine, Connie Nielsen, Robin Wright), just the right amount of comic relief (the 1918 men vs Wonder Woman, Steve Trevor's old friends), and a lot of really good action. The only slight problem I could find was the realism of a few of the war scenes. But nothing is that perfect.","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

This movie is as good as any Spiderman(I think 2 is the best) and Superman(again 2 is the best) and in some ways breaks new ground. I have 5 reasons to give it a 10. 1.The opening scene (a faded photo from millionaire Batman Bruce Wayne no less) ties in to an excellent scene 2/3 of the way through the movie and adds continuity where they take pictures like so many WW1 pictures I see in the daily Mail every day 2.It is the first time I have seen a superhero in a real life situation.. the Green Goblin or Doctor Octopus are not real but WW1 is real and even Ludendorff is real. For that reason alone it is ground breaking 3. If you have seen ""Paths of Glory"" or ""All Quiet.."" you know what ""over the top"" means. To see Wonder Woman go over the top is amazing, and the fact that Steve(love interest) says ""she is taking all the fire..let's go"" makes it even better. I could watch that scene all day.4 The scenes of London and the crossing to the continent ring true having seen ""Chariots of Fire"" and even Downton Abbey we know what carnage WW1 brought to the U.K and continent. The attention to detail is amazingI want to see this again and fear that the director could not possibly see lightning strike twice is a sequel. I will certainly give it a shotSpoiler- 5. Steve actually dies..I am sick of the ""love interest"" miraculously surviving at the end and we see WW feel pain that will motivate her to continue to serve.Well done by one and all","7 out of 20 found this helpful.

That's because its more than just a film, its a movement. One that should have been made decades ago, but was made now and it was worth the wait. Gal Gadot is tremendous as Wonder Woman, what makes her so fierce? The sexy costume? the awesome fight scenes ? how stunningly beautiful she is? the fact that she's a woman? NO. It's her naivet√©, her humor, her display of compassion, her sweetness and her innocence. And yes its also her stunning beauty, her strength and her charisma. It's rare to find an actor so perfect for a role, nail it so well and be so well liked. What rises the film above the rest is not just wonderful Gadot, its the director. The film is incredibly well made with excellent visual sand cinematography. Part mythology, part male fantasy, part awesome fights, part locations, and mainly great character development.The fact that it's a woman who directed is what makes it a big deal. A female lead led by a female director in the best DC installment in years... yes, its not a conversation, its a movement. One that is bound to start a trend. A trend that says:WOMEN ARE HERE. WOMEN ARE STRONG. YOU CAN LOOK UPTO A WOMAN. WOMEN CAN LEAD. WOMAN CAN BREAK RECORDS. AND WOMEN CAN DO IT ALL. Like i said, its so much more than just a film, its a movement, and as man, as a feminist, and as an inpatient superhero fan waiting for a good DC film i am beyond satisfied and proud to be part of the movement. Eagerly waiting for a sequel. Final Grade A","9 out of 28 found this helpful.

I guess all superhero movies end almost the same way these days. But if this one did not, it would get a 10 instead of a 9. There is a little more than partial male nudity in one of the scenes, if you are sensitive about that sort of thing. The end was kind of predictable, and the it seemed intentional.

David Thewlis who is a brilliant character actor, simply doesn't fit as the god of war either. Better see him in Fargo 3, where he really shines!Wonder Woman is the usual superhero cash grab fest based on a completely predictable, paint by numbers script. The script here is so interchangeable it could fit any Hollywood heroes from Indiana Jones to Robert Downey Jr's impersonation of Sherlock Holmes. On the bright side there are a few laughs here, including the unintentional ones when they cut back and forth between the stunt woman and Gal Gadot.Wonder Woman this is surely not, but a brainless 141 min adventure ride. If you expected any other than another DC Comics sell-out at this time the last laugh is on you.","13 out of 31 found this helpful.

I was very hesitant to see this film due to the fact that DC movies have been extremely disappointing in the past few years. Some of the positives include; The character development or our hero. Gal Gadot delivers the best performance possible for this character. From her appearance to her personality, she was perfect. I also liked how the film dealt with the supporting character played by Chris Pine. A film directed and dominated by women, did not feel like feminist overload. The male and female characters were given substantial depth. Some other positives include the action scenes, the look of the film and the score. Overall it was a very well directed, solid film, although a major problem was the depth of the villains. Every villain was extremely shallow, two dimensional and were not engaging. Another issue was the over use of CGI especially in the last scene. I also felt that some of the dialogue was quite weak, but on the other hand some of the dialogue was very funny and engaging. All in all I would really recommend this film. Its highly entertaining, and made extremely well. Patty Jenkins should direct more DC films. Zack Snyder could never make a super hero movie of this quality and coherence. 8/10","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

After her appearance in Batman v Superman, you had a feeling she would get her own solo movie, and now here it is.The story takes during the time of World War 1, where Diane(Gal Gadot) was raised on the hidden Island Themyscira, to Amazon race. One day her life is turned upside down when a pilot named Steve Trevor(Chris Pine) comes crashing down on the Island. Diane saves his life, and decides to help him. and goes to America with him.This was way better then Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad which I think where modest hits, Wonder Woman has a film really delivers, everything you would want in an origin story. Much has I liked Man of Steel, the more I watched it the flaws keep showing. Gal Gadot plays Wonder Woman the character very well and not annoyingly one noted, when she comes into a new world, her situations are never played in a sitcom like way like it was in THOR. Chris Pine was good has Steve, she had Gadot have good chemistry, surprisingly . Action scenes are very well filmed, in a 300 like way. The World War 1 setting looks very realistic, and not just a set. At times he feels like those old war mission movies from the 60's. Everybody here shines as well. Makes me now looking forward to Justice League.","6 out of 17 found this helpful.

It shows that we can be tough, even more than men if we try very hard, just like with anything else, we can be who we want to be with practice. I absolutely love this movie.

Diana is the main focus but we get a sense of who the main supporting characters are as well. Especially Steve Trevor who is treated way better by the script than his female counterparts from similar movies. I really liked the merry band of misfits accompanying Diana on her quest. They gave both a face and perspective to the war and to humanity. Etta was my favorite. The casting was amazing as well. Gal Gadot gave Diana strength, certain arrogance coming from trusting one's abilities but also innocence, naivety and vulnerability. Chris Pine was charming as a spy should be while not threatened at all by Diana's abilities and his feelings for her. And the Big Bad? Maybe I should have figured it out on my own but I like surprises, so why bother. They were sufficiently threatening and it was easy to understand and fear their monstrosity. The action sequences were really cool as well. Though there were a couple of instances where the CGI was a little too on the nose. My favorite was the very first fight on the beach. So beautiful and heartbreaking. Visually it was also very appealing. The costumes, scenery, camera work. And also the music was well picked. Overall, it was everything one could wish for from such a movie. Compelling story-telling, interesting multi-dimensional characters, humor and emotions, stunning visuals. Well done, girls, well done.","7 out of 21 found this helpful.

But after watching Gal Gadot playing the role so beautifully and so fiercely, I changed my whole mind. The movie addressed a bit of gender equality, a bit of history, a bit of culture, a bit of humor, and lots of actions. I enjoy all the slow motion of Wonder Woman's fighting. The soundtracks and ending credits song are all good.

DC hit's a homer with this one. Not knowing the Wonder Woman story, it was great to progress through this origin with her. Great use of the Matrix style slow and stop action. I love this because you can really take in all the beauty of the scene and respect the production elements that go into it. Marvels Days of Future Past set the bar high with the Quick Silver segment and there is enough sprinkling of that filming technique used in this movie...more please. Nice twist near the end, as we find out who she is looking for.Although we did see the Real 3D Extreme version, I can't really recall any spectacular 3D elements, other than it pretty much all looked very good. Also, there is a handful of scenes where I wish I could hit the rewind button...just to fast for ordinary humans to take in.Congrats to all the production teams and the cast. I am definitely Wonder Woman's latest fanboy!JD","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

I have mixed feelings about it because 3 previous DCEU movie receive many negative reviews and I feel that they are rushing on getting this movie out on the theater. I have no expectation on this film. I only watch the first trailer for Wonder Woman and then done. I didn't watch the rest of the trailer anymore.But, when I finally watch Wonder Woman. all i can say is... ""You finally nailed it DC"". Wonder Woman is a very very good movie. I love the script. I love the story. I love the color of the film, it's very vibrant. I love the camera work and shot in this film, it's really beautiful. I love this movie also takes time to develop their characters, so we do care about every decision that they are making.I love almost every character in this movie. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is very good. because she shows that she's not just an amazon with god-like power. but, she also has some vulnerability. We can see that she's been through and we can see how she feels conflicted with her decision. Chris Pine as Steve Trevor is also very good, i love how he interact with Gal Gadot in this film. their chemistry is very good. I like how they both learn about each other's cultures. because they are from a very very different universe. I also like other character like Antiope, Sameer, Charlie, Chief, Etta. They are tiny characters but they can give a big impact to the film and with only small moments we can learn a lot more about them. The jokes in this film is also handle very well. Seriously, this is film is quite hilarious. What i love about the script is that, we do learn more and sometimes question our way of act as human. Because when Diana (Wonder Woman) ask Steve Trevor about something we would be like ""ohhh.. yeah why did we do that?"". My favorite part in this film is in the third act where they are resting after and before they fight in a town. Because we learn more things about Charlie, Sameer and Chief and we see what they are dealing with, we learn more about them. Okay, let's get to the part what I don't like about this film. The villains, how the action was portrayed and the final act of the film. For me, The problem with DCEU right now is they are not good at casting the villain. The villain in this film is the weakest character in this film I think. Because their motives is unclear, although they explained it. Still, it's very weak motive and we don't feel for them. We didn't care a little bit about their motives. The action of the film is not really bad. But, what I don't like is that there's too many slow motion. Like the other typical Zack Snyder's movie. also, the action sometimes is a little bit too much. Just a little bit. It's not bad. I just don't like it. But I feel some people would be fine with it.Then, the final act for the film is the second biggest problem of the film after the villain. The final act is where I think the movie falls off a little bit. They start really strong. it's like up up up up up and then they start declining a little bit. The final act is very CGI heavy. They are not bad. The CGI is very good actually. But I just feel it's not necessary and then that's also one shot in the film where it's very random, like very out of place. Like, ""why would she do that?"" and also there's a line in the final act where it's very out of place too. But, those are my small problems with this movie. Other than that, Wonder Woman is a very good film. I'm very happy with it. Patty Jenkins as the director did a very well job on directing it. I highly recommended this film if you guys haven't watch it. I'm gonna give Wonder Woman 8/10.I think that's all for my review of Wonder Woman. Thank you for reading this review and please do rate it if you find this review useful and thank you again for spending your time to read my review. I'll see you in the next review.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

I went to the premiere night and it was one of the best times I had at the movies.Wonder Woman prove that DC Comics can make a good live action movie once you have the right keys together.It's perhaps the best movie so far in the DC Extended Universe because the cast and crew makes you appreciate the hard work they put into the movie and they stay true to the comic book and the legend of Wonder Woman.The acting is very well done the movie actually got actors who can make you like the characters the best performances I have to give to Gal Gadot who plays Wonder Woman. She really step up and become the character not only was she beautiful but she was a strong lead for the character and it shows that she adore the role. The second best goes to Chris Pine who plays Steve Trevor you can tell that Chris was having fun with the role and he really did good in the movie.The comedy in the movie really helps the story along with keeping your interest.The action is just amazing it will keep you on the edge of your seat it was just very well done some of the best action in a movie in so long.The music is superb every piece of music is helping with the story and keeps the movie going.Wonder Woman just proves that DC Comics can make a great movie and that you can make a great movie all together if you put your cards together.You won't be disappointed with this movie at all I give Wonder Woman an 9 out of 10","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

This film is definitely a step in the right direction for the DC Superheros, though, it doesn't make up for the travesties which came before it. They should use this as the mile stick with which to measure their up and coming films. Though I cannot help but feel Justice League will be taking a few steps backwards from this film.I liked the fact that the writers decided to use mix the origin stories up and have Diana coming to the world of man during the First World War; this strengthens the concept of her being immortal. As well as allowing for some nice special effects in the dog fight scenes and other period specific weaponry. Zeus created the Amazons to bring love and peace to mankind, though mankind corrupted by Ares enslaved them. Hippolyte led a revolt to free the Amazons and when Zeus brought the god to help in their defence Ares killed them. Zeus with his dying breath crippled Ares and created Themyscira to hide the Amazons from mankind. So here is the first error, Zeus is dead but yet he later breathes life into a clay-shaped human effigy to create Diana. All is well on the island until Steve Trevor's plane crashes off the coast and Diana dives in to save him. Trevor has the secret poison book of Dr, Maru; the Germans hot on his trail shoot him down, Here comes a second error, there's a group of Germans in a rowboat looking for the wreckage of the plane, they stick their head through the fog which hides the island and then attacks the Amazons... and lose, of course. Though I did wonder where the battleship they came from and the one which had shot Trevor down has disappeared to... as we see no more Germans (sloppy writing). Believing Ares is to blame for the ongoing war, Trevor describes, Diana takes it upon herself to hunt him down and kill him, with the God Killer sword.As I stated there are a couple of obvious errors in the opening set up and this continues throughout the film. It would have been nice if somebody had pointed them out so they could be taken care off. Most of them are small issues and easily resolved but they do hinder the film a little. However, they are only small and the movie is pretty massive so the good does outweigh the bad. Though Gal Gadot does a good job in the Wonder Woman persona, she's not too great as Diana Prince. Saying she's coming from an island where the main way to travel is by horse and foot, where they are trained in sword fighting and archery, and the main food is fresh fish, vegetables and fruit she doesn't appear too surprised by automobiles, aeroplanes, ships, and the modern weaponry... let alone the ""new food"". Though they include the ""Ice Cream"" scene it would have been nice to have seen a little more childish enthusiasm and awe in this character.Chris Pine fits the Steve Trevor character like a glove and gets his persona down pat, though a little more womanising, or even hints at it would've added strength to it. Lucy Davis is splendid as Etta Candy, Steve Trevor's secretary, and actually has the air of awe I wished Diana Prince to have. The bad guy Ludendorff and his crony Dr Maru are brilliantly played by Danny Huston and Elena Anaya, respectively. They give a creepy and flesh-crawling performance in their roles. David Thewlis was an inspired choice for Sir Patrick, though I have to admit I'm not too sure that he was completely right for the part, though I do know what the writers and director were doing when they cast him. Not a completely genius move, but close.Patty Jenkins does a marvellous job of the directing. She keeps the action tight and fast paced though has the nerve to slow it down at the right times to emphasize an action, a movement, or a special effect. This keeps it interesting for the viewer. Though in the more drama based sets she opts for a more standard style of camera work. A few differing camera angles would have been nice. Though this is a lighter film in atmosphere to other DC adaptations there are a lot of scenes shot in dark atmosphere's A little normal lighting and brighter sets would've strengthened the darkness and grimness of the front line, which was filmed with the same filters as their entry into London. So the front line could have been a muddy football field in London. It would have been nice to bring DC out of the dark fully.That said this is a really entertaining film, which sticks to the characters basic ethos. It is a spectacularly nice waste of time which I would recommend anybody to see and unlike previous DC Universe Movies, this one is really worth watching... and may even be worth keeping. As stated before, I hope they take heed of this movie and implement this style of film making and storytelling into their upcoming films.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

It has her leaving the island where she was born and raised to enter the world of men and help battle World War 1. She also meets Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) and falls in love.This has been praised to the high heavens for some reason. It's an OK super hero movie but nothing special. It takes forever to get going (it's almost 90 minutes in before we see Wonder Woman in costume) and it is slow and quite frankly boring. It's also too serious and grim. Why do all DC super hero movies have to be so dark? Also Chris Pine is seriously miscast. On the plus side the action sequences are great. Full of energy and PG rated violence. Nice use of stop motion also. Gadot is great as Wonder Woman. She's strong, fearless and full of energy. Also nice production design and a bombastic music score.

After seeing Wonder Woman last night I can say that Marvel might have a tougher opponent than we've thought. So yes, DC is back! And who do we have to thank? It would take long to describe all the positive aspects of this film; ranging from the script which isn't rough at all - the dialogue flows smoothly, it's not trying to be ""Marvel funny"", and therefore feels real almost to the point of losing the feeling of watching a movie; to fitting, this time even colorful sets, great action pieces and other scenes, and to the biggest stars - the actors. Gal Gadot is a perfect choice. As Wonder Woman she's highly likable, true, convincing, strong but not independent, and she works great with co-actor Chris Pine, who is at the very top with his performance, right next to Gadot. The side characters vary from underdeveloped, yet believable to completely unimportant. Luckily, the movie doesn't suffer from this. We can point out two flaws. Usually Marvel has poorly written villains but now it seems DC tried to beat them at that. No worries. But then there's the CGI which gets heavy at times. All in all the flaws are overshadowed by the good. Now the question is how will Justice League do. If I tie this to a line from the film:""Im both frightened and aroused.""","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

The marketing is now more important than having a good director and it seems to be the way forward but thankfully we have tapes if we want to revel in the glories of the past, where films focused almost to a fault on characters, struggles (flaws), acting, story, props, costumes, music and design.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

What a pity the opening sequences had some interesting moments but like the entire film nothing gets into anything really worth while.A huge crew a great director who's MONSTER was at moments brilliant and afforded its lead actor Charlize Theron a well deserved Oscar. Hollywood being sexist of course did not nominate Patty for an awards - so the story continues.We don't hear from Patty until she makes a comic book action back female based movie. Lots of money lots of case and crew special effects the whole thing you would expect from an action film.This is not art this is just awful. Can't blame anyone in particular this is what Hollywood is offering its stars talent and audiences. Big blockbuster destruction for big profits.STOP IT JUST STOP IT. One thing I have to say which I enjoyed was watching an Israeli Jewish woman beat the crap out of Germans. Besides that - don't waste your time.","9 out of 20 found this helpful.

But, after watching this movie, my faith for DCEU has returned. Wonder Woman is fantastic. This movie was everything that I wanted it to be. It was great, exciting, funny, action packed, and also told a story that is inspiring. The technical points of this film are stunning. There is an incredible amount of beauty and aura around this film that I haven't seen in DCEU yet. Gal Gadot is fantastic as Diana and Wonder Woman. She does what RDJ did to Tony Stark's character, what Chris Evans did to Cap's character. She was incredible in this film and also is Chris Pine, who in my opinion is still, the best supporting role in any movie this year. Like I said, the action sequences are fantastic. They are exciting and great to look at. The score was really good, but still I prefer the score for Wonder Woman in BvS. Guys, this movie was fantastic. Also, this movie shows two perspectives of people and how they think. And they connect these two perspectives very beautifully. At last, I have got a movie in DC Universe that I could watch over and over again and never get bored of and I could say that I loved Wonder Woman.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

Chris Pine delivers a strong performance as well. Compared to Man of Steel and Batman vs Superman, this movie is a far superior product in terms of story line, direction & visual effects.

Probably one of the best movies I've seen in a while.They also probably thought it was cheaper to go over the top than to make it look like a realistic glowing rope. But did you SEE all those VFX people in the credits? Holy moly. It was like 4 entire companies and I'm pretty sure one company was hired solely for horse hair and one on water. Seriously there was a ton of VFX.There were also a couple of jumps where their trajectories made no sense and that bugged me. There was also a tad too much CG but I appreciated that the entire movie was like that versus in the hobbit where you could CLEARLY tell when they were adding them - aka Smaug / Legolas.The bad guy was great but I wish they switched out the actor after the reveal. After being hyped up the entire movie it was odd to see Aries end up being so scrawny. I do agree that he did have the gravitas of Aries which may have been hard to transfer if they did switch actors. I mean he did look good in that shirtless scene but he's no Jason Mamoa (which BTW I can't wait for, I love Aquaman).There were some subtle nuances that I really appreciated in it though that definitely had a lot of thought to it. It made scenes more realistic and less forced. The acting was also really good and the costuming was on point. Story was great, pacing was great, super pretty, and amazing acting. I'd probably give it an 8-9/10 on rotten tomatoes.","5 out of 14 found this helpful.

Patty Jenkins and Gal Gadot did Wonder Woman justice. The new way of how female superhero supposed to be. They even tackled the text book superhero principle well in gray reality (instead of black and white).Wonder Woman as a movie is not lacking flaws, in fact there are quite a few to mention. However, this movie is enjoyable from female, male and children point of view. It has the making of a classique movie. Time will tell how it will be with the box office and critical reception.My recommendation, just go and watch it. This is the first superhero movie that a couple can truly enjoy, a family can watch and discuss, and it left us with a sweet after taste. There are sad drama, romance, humour, a touch of horror, plenty of explosive actions, and surprises.","6 out of 18 found this helpful.

She was perceived as a bimbo by many and received no respect. That memory made me oppose the idea of this movie. ""Here we go again.""What changed my mind was reading some initial reviews by women and looking at Gal Gadot's bio. I was astonished to read a woman say she was going to take her daughters to see the film. That could only mean strong approval for Gal Gadot's presentation, and no 'jiggle-factor'. Reading that she was a combat instructor in the Israeli Army as well as being a former Miss Israel was intriguing. This might work! Seeing it was a great experience!I am not a sociologist, but ""Wonder Woman"" seems to come at a time when girls/women are yearning for an ideal heroine they can own. Strong female disapproval of this film would have killed it in days. Gal Gadot superbly provides a believable, fully-developed character that taps into what women want. A woman director was the key to ""Wonder Woman"". Chris Pine, Robin Wright, and Connie Nielson are all effective in shaping Wonder Woman's growth and evolution as a person. Well recommended, BUT, the final climactic battle is way Overdone. It follow the same kitchen-sink formula as Man of Steel, Transformers, etc.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Diane and I, who usually agree on the worth of movies, thought very differently about this film.I admit at the very beginning of this comment that I am an old codger who dislikes modern Hollywood productions. Diane wanted to go because Hollywood broke their age-old pattern of making male centered movies so I accompanied her against my better judgment because I loathe popular ""blockbuster"" movies and this turned out not to be an exception.I also admit to falling asleep during the first part where Wonder Woman is growing up but then saw the second half where she fights in the First World War. The last 2/3rds that I saw were pretty bad; the war scenes were typical ""god guys beating up the bad guys"" that Hollywood seems unable to discard. I am sitting here shaking my head at those terrible war bits towards the completion of this bad movie. Please read the One Star comments because they said what I think except they write better than I and they remember the scenes far better than I.I thought Gal Gadot who played the mature Wonder Woman was either directed badly or could not act well because the faces she pulled during the scenes in England and particularly during the battle scenes in France were Beyond the Pale. Admittedly she had terrible scripted scenes to work with and the Director should never have kept all of her close-ups. You can forgive all of these complaints but you cannot all of the Hollywood German-bashing in the second half of the film.","11 out of 26 found this helpful.

It looks like there is hope for the DCEU after all.Ambitious Amazon Warrior Diana (Gal Gadot) seeks to fight for good and triumph over evil, but is restrained by her mother, until USA Army spy Steven Trevor (Chris Pine) accidentally lands in the hidden Amazon island, Diana fins her opportunity to become a great hero as Trevor tells about the great war of all wars bringing terror to his world. Accompanying him to the First World War, Diana is determined to bring an end to the suffering and promote piece.Not paying tribute the cheesy 70s show, Wonder Woman becomes its own film, fitting into the classic superhero criteria and being a mash up of others. Its Superman meets Thor, meets Captain America. Patty Jenkins has put the DCEU on track with a exciting, surprisingly fun adventure.Gal Gadot wielding the Lasso of truth, really invests in her character as a spectacular ambitious warrior princess but also a caring morally strong figure dedicated to bringing about peace. It is great to see probably the first great female superhero film, matching the quality of a classic marvel film, but also with no female gaze at all, and just so enriching to see this strong female lead be the driving force of power and good.Supporting her brave acts is Chris Pine being pretty much Chris Pine but not in a captain Kirk way, but as an admirable noble fighter, and love interest of the female lead, not a damsel in distress, just with amusing quirkiness.Although it starts fairly slow and shall I say a tad awkward in atmosphere, what escalates is a journey of gorgeous fun and thrills, really air punching excitement and joy. It may appear as another dark shady Snyder esc CGI parade is actually much more depend in its substance and values, but still including is grand a special effects performance. One of the great surprises was its heart and moral themes examining human nature and violence and war, which is mostly brought to life by the leading lady herself. With all that is going on in the world at the moment, I really do think we could all do with a bit of Diana Prince, encouraging us with high spirited drive for peace.What is one of it strengths is the fact that the film does take time to establish story and context, which is then beautifully combined with the grand action sequences. Maybe too many slow Mo action shots for my taste but still wonderfully put together thrilling set pieces. Accompanied by Rupert Gregson-Williams' music, we enter an empowering tone of heroics and spirit. As per usual, they just can't resist that big CGI ending, as we do bare witness to another explosive final act, that is not as heavy as BvS or mad as Man of Steal, but still remains part of this growing superhero tradition.What can only be said is just a great fun experience, and hope for the future of the DCEU. I do really hope to see more of Wonder Woman, and really do recommend this to be a encouraging film for the moment. It may be unlikely that is message will reach the whole world, but still acts n its own as an inspiring portrait. 8.4/10","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Every review those first few days were GLOWING 10/10. Couldn't wrap my head around it..were people seeing a different movie than I saw? Then a few of my friends left negative reviews--those reviews were flagged and promptly taken down. Then I left a negative review..next day? same thing. WHOA.After a few weeks had passed and WW was declared a box office success I checked back on IMDb AND finally thats when the REAL reviews started showing up. People thought this movie was awful..because it was. Look I read some reviews that said Gal Gadot can't act..shes a model..so on and so forth. I don't agree. This movie was absolutely terribly written and directed. If she looked like she was walking a runway in every F'ing scene..it's because of the director..not her. Think back to BVS..She was awesome in that--she had depth, darkness and this sexy shroud of mystery. They really set her like a super powered Femme Fatale. In WW she said stupid sh*t like "" I fight for love""....whatttttt?I'm done reading and listening to reviews. I could give a crap what some paid off critic says! I'm going off my own instinct and deciding for myself from here on out if I want to pay my hard earned money to see a film!Wonder Woman looked absolutely terrible in the trailers. I could tell it was going to be awful..and then it came out..and supposedly EVERYONE(who the heck is ""everyone"" anyway? no one I know.) was raving about it. So I caved..I went to see it.My girlfriend and I were so bummed we wasted that money I cant even tell you! People were walking out 40 minutes in. The people left at the end were BOOING!These critics were paid off! If these same people can tell you BVS was a bad film..then rave about this heaping pile...THEN THEY ARE CORRUPT LIARS! They really are fake news! I'm finished with critics. Rave reviews. Rotten tomatoes! If something looks good to me..then ill see it! and if doesn't I won't!30 dollars I'll never see again! Could've went to in and out! Wasted my friggin cheat day on this ish!","12 out of 29 found this helpful.

last night (for about the seventh time) we viewed Wonder Woman.Almost newcomer Gal Gadot was amazing, Chis Pine (Star Trek captain),
was great, Connie Nielsen (Gladiator) was the perfect choice for the
Amazon Queen and Robin Wright was outstanding.This iteration of Wonder Woman was panned by some as Israeli Gadot
wasn't the muscular Linda Carter type, instead she was tall, lithe and
muscular, but it worked - and guess what - pregnant for much of the movie;
the Director Patty Jenkins (who did a great job) had to use green screen to not show this; however Gal performed admirably, and to us Gal Gadot WAS Wonder Woman.All and all, my girl and I give this movie a 9/10; we laughed and cried and cheered. Well worth your time, and we both await the next 'WW 1984'.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

She has been raised her whole life with the best available military and political training to be the best warrior the amazons could ever produce. War finally becomes a reality and no longer a bedtime story when a strange man washes up on shore and throws her into the middle of WW1.A lot of the movies in the DC Universe have a dark undertone behind their plots, WW does not. Its light movie which make it resemble much of what we have come use to seeing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. One reason I believe this movie shines is because it does such a good job with a lead woman role. One of the biggest reason I love this movie is because it doesn't base its character around feministic characteristics into her personality. It's a huge let down for me when women roles only try to show they're leadership by putting the men around them down. Gadot does the opposite by destroying all stereotypes about women in the early 1900's with her actions and bravery throughout the film. This is the best movie DC has been able to put out in the extended universe.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

They expect the global audience to know the backstory of these Greek gods and feel the power and importance of them but that surely doesn't seem to be working.The exponential growth in power at the end seemed illogical.But one major thing established before DC venturing into justice league is that wonder woman is way more powerful and has the capacity to do anything. This is major achievement by DC as Marvel has continuously failed to portray powerful woman character in big screens.It's one time watch and I wouldn't be waiting for it's blue-ray disk release to watch it again.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

Great Origins story of wonder woman and an enjoyable experience overall. I am pleasantly surprised by Gal Gadot's performance and her ability to carry this film. Any doubts about Gal's ability to portray wonder woman in all her glory will be put to rest. She and other cast member do a good job of doing justice to their roles but that standout was Chris Pine who steals the show, for me. The action scene are nice, and remind me a bit of Justice league visual style. the CGI is good but can be improved in some places, especially during Gal Gadot's fighting scene. The story is entertaining and the mild humour offer moments of relaxation. Overall, this film is an enjoyable film that does justice to the greatest female superhero of all time. Good job DC. Let hope the trend continues.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

If tomatoes could speak, they'd shouted over this movie. If all men had a brain, they'd never ever watched such wasteful garbage. I deeply feel as I'm being fooled by a bunch of bad made CGI and an actress, who most probably got this role, because she is nice and sexy, but possesses in no way, any kind of acting abilities. Basically, all she does all the movie is to pose in front of camera with shoulders wide, getting into jump mode with one knee bent etc etc. I mean, do men don't see enough beautiful women nowadays, so even the movie actresses must be beautiful and sexy to attract people to the theaters? Beside that, the only positive thing about this movie is Chris Pine. Without him, I'd stood up and left the theater. Expect to watch absolutely no character built up, no worthy dialogues, no real fights, even if it is a fantasy film, it all makes no sense at all. Two villains who come out of nowhere with no real background or any story behind. They suddenly get killed like they're not important at all. I mean, come on, give us something to enjoy. I'd watch Baywatch, if it's all about seeing a sexy woman acting like a super hero!","6 out of 12 found this helpful.

OK, with that been say, some may say that it bias. It is what it is, but you can not deny the box office numbers, like it or not it is what it is and it did what it did, even still doing. Awesome movie from opening to closing. Very entertaining solid story line, and yes if you didn't know the history of her existence you got a glimpse of it from the movie, but(yes there is a but) it is far more deeper than what's in the movie. Do your research, and not just pulling from the movie script. Straight from the Side Bar Review. The movie save the summer blockbuster openings. The only disappointing thing about this movie is the fact all that it did in 1 week of opening worldwide. She got robbed! Gal Gadot, got paid far less then her male counter part actors that did less not even coming close to what Wonder Woman did in it opening. Nevertheless, she killed it while she made the statement about female super heroes. Love Marvel, but DC nailed it with Wonder Woman. Awesome movie, a wonder woman with a super bang!","6 out of 19 found this helpful.

I can't critique it on the merits of movie-making, but when a movie kept me on a natural-high long after the end credits, it's pretty awesome. And it left me with a new sense of hope, which had been much waning these days. At first, hearing all the hype around this movie, I went in quite skeptical and with very low expectations since, more often than not, highly rated movies by critics almost always turned out to be duds for me. Verdict:I was totally enraptured. I thought the acting was just right, chemistry between the two leads palpable, action scenes not over-killed (unlike Batman vs Superman), just enough humor without being cheesy, plot interesting enough to pull it together. (Some reviewers said it was WWII, but it takes place in WWI.)It's not unusual to see the haters of this movie cuz it's not for everyone. Love it, hate it--you decide. But I can hardly wait for the DVD/Blu-ray to come out.

However, in the case of WW, this movie truly deserves my time to reflect on. The script, actors, and scenes of the movie all flowed flawlessly together, leaving the spectator to truly respect what was presented on screen. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine as well as the supporting cast were excellent. What DC, Snyder, and Jenkins did was phenomenal. I will not spoil if for anyone, as far as the action sequences and general story/plot, however, I will elaborate on how powerful the views that were expressed in the movie. WW is a movie that truly shows the audience why fighting for the little guy, and why truth, honesty, and integrity are so important in life. To me, this movie teaches people why empathy and consideration as well as willing to put someone else first before yourself can really change things. Bravo DC, you have definitely set a new bar in superhero movies.","6 out of 19 found this helpful.

It's an average superhero movie with a below average acting. And it's not because I can't stand Chris Pine that I write this. His acting skills are just not great, like you would expect for a movie with such a high budget. Gal Gadot is a nice girl to look at, that's for sure, but here also the acting wasn't that great. The different battle shots are way over the top, even if that's usual for superhero movies, and the CGI wasn't that great either. The story is also a bit long and boring.

Wonder woman is not just a wonderfully entertaining film; it also provides a new and beautiful vision of gender relations in America. The Feminist movement went completely off the rails when Gloria Steinem and her ilk began judging women who wanted to be housewives and mothers. The so-called men's movement sputtered and died almost before it began. The relationship between Chris Pine and Gal Gadot gives us a vision of relationships that honors both the feminine and the masculine. This vision takes us beyond the petty power struggles that destroy the vast majority of relationships in America. It is a relationship in which each person shows up with all of their passion, their presence, and their gifts. No one is diminished. Thank you, Patty, for such a wonderful vision.","6 out of 19 found this helpful.

I was not disappointed at all. The movie was fast paced, thoughtful, offered strong performances, and overall a good watch. My test question of ""how long is this movie"" was never realized meaning my attention never wavered. CGI clearly is important for the supernatural scenes especially, but IMHO they were decent.While many reviewers talk about the cinematic elements of this movie, I reflected on many of the cultural implications of the story and castings. It is a world movie. WASPs were not the superheroes in this film, but clearly a variety from who-knows-where made the movie so much stronger. It makes the case for working collectively on threats of cruelty, inhumanity, violence, and others. It is NOT a lecture film pushing you in any direction other than humanity elements of good vs evil need our superheroes. Gods and humanity both were examined and brought to life whether evil or not.Now that I have said that, I only thought about these issues after the movie, and during the movie I was thoroughly engaged with the action. It was a smart and satisfying experience. It deserves my 10 out of ten score. I cannot imagine a better casting choice for Wonder Woman than Gadot. Pine was excellent. And there were some surprises. And Lynda Carter even received ""special thanks"" in the final credits.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

Not only is it a ""fun"" movie -- but it's also a ""good"" one, with solid writing and character-development to match the larger-than-life heroics.I particularly enjoyed the lengthy prologue, which introduces Diana and her Amazonian family on their home island, a faux-Grecian paradise which is hidden away from the rest of the world behind a kind of supernatural cloaking-device. The film takes its time with these early scenes, revealing the nature of Diana's upbringing and the reasons for her simplistic but naive goodheartedness. These scenes are also beautiful, depicting a paradise that looks remarkably real, without excessive CGI work. I was reminded, in a way, of the old Greek-themed adventure films, such as Hercules, Jason and the Argonauts, and Clash of the Titans. There's an on-location quality to the island scenes in ""Wonder Woman"" that does more to establish a sense of reality than even the best CGI can muster.And then the film becomes a WWI espionage adventure, as Diana finds herself drawn into the world of mortals to try and stop a kind of violence she doesn't fully understand. I was entertained by the colorful cast of characters, as well as by the film's charmingly earnest sensibility. This is easily the most downright ""earnest"" superhero film since Marvel's original ""Captain America,"" and I think it's a better film to boot. Diana's strong-but-naive persona brings out the finer qualities in Steve Trevor, the British spy with whom her life has become entangled, and they have a chemistry that's a lot of fun to watch. Like most superhero films, ""Wonder Woman"" had a few too many action- climaxes for my taste, some fairly gaping plot-holes -- (For starters, what happened to that battleship off the coast of the island, which looms ominously before the film totally forgets about it?) -- and the final act is a bit messy. I also thought, for all the talk about the film's Feminist narrative -- well, I'll just say that whatever Feminist narrative it offers is fairly superficial, contained almost entirely in the fact that the film's protagonist is a strong woman who doesn't require a man to save her. But perhaps that's all fine enough. Ultimately, I just wanted a good, fun movie, and ""Wonder Woman"" delivered a better time than I had expected. It does a great job of establishing its world and characters, and it tells its story in a satisfying, fun, and emotionally meaningful way. In its best moments, it even achieves a kind of wholesome, humorous, iconic quality that I don't believe we've seen on screen since Richard Donner's original ""Superman."" So yes, I am comparing it unironically to that classic of the genre. One might consider the two films as equals.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Besides the okay CGI, the film almost met my expectations, and they were pretty high. Those that complain on the lack of wonder woman's boldness, independence and feminism know too little on parenting, Diana's mom did not allow her to abide by the philosophies of a being a warrior at a young age, which means that Diana would grow as an innocent and naive young lady. Yes she has her training, yes people wanted her character to be just as Antiope's was, but you have to be wise enough to understand that she is still too young and unfamiliar to threat, someone who was first raised as a sweet, pacifist, respectful and innocent little girl protected by her mother. She then walks into a world full of violence, which she was not ready for psychologically, This ""lack of feminism"" I constantly hear about outstandingly appears when she stands strong against high ranking officers and leaders, denouncing them as cowards in hiding, while her desire was to fight injustice alongside those in the front lines, proving that she is worthy of being Wonder Woman. To be honest, Gal portrays the perfect woman, who respects Steve, listens to Steve, dressed up for Steve, follows Steve, but also challenges him and other people when she knows her beliefs are justified and takes action herself without their approval, but never goes psycho and nuts like 99% of women in this world. She led the men into battle, where even a blind man can see that the indecisive soldiers were under the right leader. Once she stands up against the evils of men and war, she tenderly goes back to Steve and dances with him. As the proudly straight, women loving man that I am, I applaud this character and film for standing up against the overused and awful baby and sandwich making-only stereotype. It didn't meet my expectations because the villain was a disappointment. The film did a great job hyping it up, only to finally see Ares as an old and laughable looking villain. And just like Batman vs superman, this film was setting up for what's to come in justice league, can't wait!","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

I remembered the 1974 early movie starring Cathy Lee Crosby. That one was disappointing because they had a blonde Wonder Woman. The TV series starring Lynda Carter is legend in its own right. This version starring Gal Gadot puts the ""A"" in action! It goes back into the Origin of the famed Amazing Amazon. Through the rough and rugged training she received as a young girl, Princess Diana(Gadot). After her training, a pilot enters the island of Themyscira which man is forbidden. He does help the Amazon community fight the Germans. And it was tough for Diana's mother to accept her decision to fight against the Germans. When she goes to London, she and Steve Trevor(Chris Pine) infiltrate and go to stop the enemy from dispersing a powerful version of mustard gas. To the world, she is known as Wonder Woman, and is one fine warrior to everyone's eyes. The high octane action in the film is remarkable. Gal Gadot has a slight resemblance to Lynda Carter. I liked how she handles herself against the Germans and against Ares. I enjoyed the movie very much. I think it is one of the best DC Comics films ever made. Recommended for all the women and girls. Like Supergirl, this Wonder Woman is a must see! Rating 4.5 out of 5 stars!","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

The princess becomes an Amazon warrior and, when her world is sullied by the ways of belligerent men, she undertakes a mission to set the world right.Her venture into the surrounding world is a fish out of water story that becomes a love story, while still retaining its focus on her crusade.

Not for long so I think I'm still eligible for this review. Overall, I hated this movie.1. Pretentious island characters due to lack of character development: A word from someone can change some lifelong decisions of another out of blue.2. I can't believe WWI should be dragged into this movie with such a na√Øve way of storytelling. It's despicable. It's disrespect. 3. True, the protagonist is out-worldly, a semi-god, and whatnot., her innocent/na√Øve way of thinking and behavior was so over the top and thus annoying. Is the target audience 8 year old who learns to integrate into society? Other than that I see no possibility of resonation.4. General lacking in convincibility. The war buddies don't have near enough characters, and the only reason for the protagonist to win is herself, her indestructible body, and her realization of love? ... Duh... No, it's her indestructible body.5. Improper fashion show all of a sudden when the woman tries out new clothes in front of a mirror. I've seen exactly that scene in __Mannequin II: On the move__, and that was a more entertaining movie than this.5. Mediocre fight scenes. In first half, it was kungfu fighting with bullets reflected and 'cool' postures. I never could hypnotize myself into believing that woman could break into a wall in only bras and such. Neither could I refrain from thinking a single shield is the sole functioning thing to protect her from damage when the bullet barrage rained on her in the battlefield. Come on, some bare part of her body must have taken the hit.I honestly regret my time wasted for this movie. And only since these few days have I spotted some honest (imo) reviews here. I'm pretty damn sure the initial general good reviews (or super hype train) was just propaganda.

Wonder Woman is a compelling story that has inspired hope and a real sense of comradely and conflict that DC in the past has failed to establish in the past. There was conflict in Batman V Superman, but i didn't feel it. There was conflict in Suicide Squad, but in reality these characters don't care(I mean there sitting at a bar having drinks and then suddenly they're like ""Well we gotta go give everyone fan service."") And That's what DC feels like. It feels like the directors are only giving the audience what they want because of fan service.Which in some cases isn't wrong. But things like Doomsday in BVS The Flash cameo in Suicide squad And then the really force intro to the Justice Leagues Profiles in BVS It's like DC is trying to scream at the top of it's lung in Neon lightsWE'RE A CONNECTED UNIVERSE JUST LIKE MARVEL, CHECK OUT OUR FAN SERVICE IT'S NOT NEEDED BUT WE DO IT ANYWAY!!It isn't trying to be an emotional journey that speaks to the audience and can also be a good time. I'm not saying be more like Marvel, I'm saying at least get us to CARE about our leads and their conflicts and you have to do that by showing that THEY care.Wonder Woman is different because you see so much emotion. You see so much love, compassion, trust, loyalty, hope, fear, desperation and you truly feel the loss, you feel the rage and conflict. I loved being on Paradise Island and seeing the Amazons fight along side one another, I really felt a strong sisterhood on how they would defend and speak to one another. Wonder Woman is a story just trying to be it's own intro to the DC expanded universe. It has its flaws and a kinda disappointing villain but was enjoyable because i felt a real connection to this character. Along with that Wonder Woman wast trying to be a feminist film. (funny how no one thought that about this movie but with Ghostbusters it was given all kinds of hate) It wasn't trying to show how Men are stronger or how they're all corrupt, no it shows how mankind/the human race no matter who you are cannot always be the best that we should set out to be. At one point they even bring up race, which I wasn't expecting, it deals with all these issues that can lead people to think certain ways. Even though there was a clear villain to this movie, i feel like just the ideas of the Human race and what that can lead to was villainous all on its own.Maybe I felt this way because she was new to her role of being a heroine and you see her make mistakes, you see her question herself and how things work, you see her fight, show courage, fear and lose a sense of hope in those she's suppose to protect which isn't something we see a lot in superhero movies, you don't see the heroes question if the public is even worth the time of day, but even then the right decision is made based on what SHE thinks and not what the influence of others should lead her to do. Over all i feel that Wonder Woman was a very enjoyable experience and was pleased to have seen it with my mother ( a huge WW fan growing up in the 70's)Wonder Woman leaves you with a real sense of hope, love and faith and I would highly recommend it!! 8/10","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Thank you for finally figuring out that the reason Marvel Studios movies work isn't because they have a fun soundtrack or because they do a bunch of cameos, but because they actually make decent movies that are true to the spirit of their heroes. Thank you for finally making a live- action Wonder Woman movie. And last, but certainly not least, thank you for making a female led superhero movie that doesn't suck.As you might've been able to guess, ""Wonder Woman"" is an astonishingly good movie. After the disasters of ""Batman v Superman"" and ""Suicide Squad"", it seemed like the studio had no idea how to run a successful superhero franchise. This was particularly sad since Warner Bros. essentially invented the genre with 1978's ""Superman"". However, ""Wonder Woman"" dodged all the problems that made ""Batman v Superman"" and ""Suicide Squad"" so abysmally bad.""Wonder Woman"" gives us a true to comic book version of the character without any shame. It's dark sure, but it also has levity. It embraces Greek mythologies and a hidden island of warrior women completely. It even manages to mix two of her origins into the movie seamlessly.Director Patty Jenkins and screenwriter Allan Feinberg must be given the most credit. Many might be tempted to handle the silly aspects of Wonder Woman's story with a wink to the audience. But instead they treat it with all the gravity needed to give the world a Wonder Woman that is both strong and human. Part of that also comes down to the performance of Gal Gadot. Although sometimes her line delivery leaves a bit to be desired, she carries herself as a hero. The whole cast here should be commended. Chris Pine's Steve Trevor is a good man in a world where sometimes good men must make hard decisions. David Thewlis and Robin Wright also provide strong roles that essentially just push the plot forward, but it feels natural here.I actually find myself wondering if ""Wonder Woman"" is actually as good as I thought or if my expectations for the DCEU are so rock bottom that the movie appears all that much better when compared to other entrants. No matter what, the fact that Wonder Woman finally presents a strong female superhero and is, at the very least, a decent movie makes it worthy to check out.The question we now have to ask, is Wonder Woman the course correction the DCEU desperately needed, or was it just a fluke? With Justice League is just around the corner, we'll know the answer soon.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

I must confess that I am not a fan of super heroes movies, buy, boy, how did I miss Heath's joker and Nolan's direction while watching that movie! The fights are OK, the editing is good, the special effects are good, but the story is very poor and predictable, and the acting of Super Woman (who is a beautiful and an amazing athletic model) is awful. She is really good at running, jumping and fighting, which is great, but that's it.The worst, in my opinion, is that the Germans are speaking... English! How awful is that! Hello? We are in 2017! From the 40s until the 90s everybody was speaking English in the American movies, despite of being French, German, Russian, or Spanish characters... and that is something I really cannot stand. It is SO fake! But now we have many good movies with Germans speaking German, French speaking French, Russians speaking Russian, and Spanish speaking Spanish. What? Americans can't read subtitles? Come on! The director could not find German actors? Give me a break! Also, the ""Germans"" in ""Wonder Woman"" have like 10 lines maximum. So, how terrible it is to read 10 lines of subtitles? Or, if the director only wanted these specific actors: these actors could not speak 10 lines of German? That was so fake and low. For me, the worst.All the Amazon women are amazing fighters. That's super nice. But then when they talk they look like those women who appear in anti-age creme commercials or fashion commercials... all so fake.The story is very predictable and the characters are not well defined. With all, it is an OK movie for teenagers: the nicest thing is that, for once, the women are the ones fighting!The editing is good (1 point), the special effects are good (1 point), the fights are good (1 point), and the fact that the women are the strong ones is really cool (2 points) (the rest... meh) = 5/10.","8 out of 18 found this helpful.

Patty Jenkins deserves lavish praise for the sensitivity, empathy, and grace that she infuses in Wonder Woman. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman is spot on, creating a memorable character that now occupies pride of place in a pantheon hitherto dominated by male superheroes. Sigh! If only this movie had come before Dawn of Justice! Only two points of discord; the movie takes its time pacing the viewer through WW's early stages - bad news for viewers battling attention deficit issues. Then the villain lacks punch and isn't quite worthy of WW's golden lasso. Barring these debatable issues, this is a movie ya gotta see, one that presses all pleasure parameters!","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

Amazingly, it's the first truly great film in this universe; I'm surprised and delighted to say. Man of steel I like, but it has its glaring faults, especially in the third act. BVS has its moments but it is a bad film overall. Suicide Squad is just horrible. It was one of the worst movie theater experiences I've had. Thankfully, this film is legitimately good. It not only has great action, but also a plot that makes coherent sense, characters with personality I actually like, and heart. Wonder Woman is basically a mix of Richard Donner's Superman and Captain America the First Avenger. Like Superman, the film is an epic that covers the highlights of Diana's (Wonder Woman) life on her isolated island of amazons, up until becoming a superhero. The film is also a period piece, taking place primarily in a war-torn setting, like Captain America. This time, it's World War I instead of WWII. When Steve Trevor, the first man to set foot on the island, crash lands there he tells Diana about the war outside in the world of man. Diana decides to go with him to destroy Ares, the God of War and stop the war. The rest of the film is basically that, with some character expansion and growth in between. I cannot think of a major fault with this film. It delivered in every way it was supposed to. One minor complaint is that the battles, especially early on, were very slow-motion heavy. Slow-motion has been milked to death since the Matrix, and I'm getting sick of it. It's not a huge issue, but it bothered me a bit. The villains are not the strongest either, which has been a trend in superhero films lately. Other than that the action was on-point, as was the effects, cinematography, and music. Wonder Woman's them in particular was amazing. I think it's one of the best superhero themes to date, up there with Superman's and Iron Man's. The acting is on-point in the film as well from everyone in the cast. I've always been a fan of Chris Pine. He did fine in the new Star Trek films and he was great in Unstoppable, which is underrated. I will say this is probably his best performance yet. Gal Gadot ultimately does a good job as Wonder Woman. I found her a bit wooden in BVS. She was still a bit wooden in the beginning of this film as well, which had me somewhat worried. However, as the film progresses, she does come into the role and gives a worthwhile performance. What this film truly has in its favor is that it has heart, which has been sorely lacking in the DCEU movies. What makes the majority of MCU movies loved my many is that they have heart to them. The characters feel like people rather than plot devices like in BVS or Suicide Squad. While the majority of the film had a rather downbeat tone, it had an upbeat message and feel, which the other DCEU movies up until now didn't really have. Overall, Wonder Woman is certainly a step in the right direction for the DCEU. Let's just hope Justice League doesn't screw it up. As a fan of the character I'm glad to finally have her adapted on the big screen, and done well.","4 out of 11 found this helpful.

It's a great standalone film and it never had the need to connect with the rest of the DCEU - which is what the DCEU needed.Gal Gadot plays a fantastic Wonder Woman. The first 2/3rds of this film are near perfect. There's great chemistry between Gal Gadot and Chris Pine, as Steve Trevor. The world of Themiscyra was breathtaking. The comedy, while sparse, was funny.I really love this film.The only thing I didn't enjoy about it was the villain. He's just bad. There's a twist that happens in regards to the villain and that was fine, but it still wasn't great.

Then again, everyone is entitled to an opinion, so here's mine.This film seems to me to run a bit long; however, it's action-packed and keeps your attention. It's not the typical thing that most movie-makers trot out when adapting a comic book or graphic novel; instead, it takes a fresh look at a superhero that we're ostensibly familiar with.Some of the details have been changed with this incarnation of Wonder Woman - a World War I backstory with Steve Trevor rather than the World War II origin story that comic book readers might be familiar with - however; the ""bones"" of the story are fully intact. Highbrow entertainment? It's not exactly something you would expect to see on Masterpiece Theater Classic on a Sunday night in winter. But then again, it isn't meant to be that. It's fast paced, entertaining, lots of things that go boom; yet it's also a story that keeps you engaged and makes you care about what happens to the characters in the end.Put succinctly: it's an action movie that has a lot of really good moments. In my humble opinion, it's probably the best (as of March 2018) DC Extended Universe movie of the bunch.

Given that I thoroughly hated the new Superman movies as well as the awful Superman vs Batman ... whatever that was, I still decided to give WW a shot ... and I was pleasantly surprised for the most part. Wonder Woman puts all other recent DC movies to shame through a nice character introduction and the build-up, though predictable (well, it's a comics inspired movie after all) it's well supported by Pine and Gadot and once their little band comes together, Taghmaoui also gets a piece of spotlight. Several in fact.I was half expecting to dread the WWI background but instead I found it refreshing. Marvel's Captain American went on for WWII, a decision saved by keeping the war in the background. Here it serves as a vehicle for the discovery of humanity, as shallow as it may be. There's plenty to like in the movie, the fighting scenes are decently choreographed, the soundtrack is great, the characters are expectedly one-dimensional.On the downside: - the editing keeps the movie from being a blast. At one point, the group who met WW couple of days ago and barely exchanged words somehow find it to give her a boost the same way she was trained as a child. I bet somewhere there's a scene that would've explained that moment - the nonsense about love and humanity that Gadot is made to spew at the very end basically wrecks the entire character buildup - David Thewlis is completely miscast. His appearance in armour is ridiculous (seriously, professor Lupin as a full fledged action hero??), at one point he's without helmet and the mustache complements the armour like a dog flea complements a cup of Earl Grey. - the movie takes itself much to seriously and I do take into account that the few bits of humour revolve around a formerly isolated person who gets updated on to the current state of things. It does pull a few laughs but not nearly enough.","9 out of 21 found this helpful.

Best Superhero film ever?","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3734034/?ref_=tt_urv","mike48128","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur19278556/?ref_=tt_urv","19 June 2017","I could also pick this film apart as there are so many stereotypes in it. ""The Chief"" (American Indian) is the worst! The story could have been set in either World War, except for the early aircraft. I have to keep reminding myself that it is a fantasy-comic book creation and it far outclasses even ""Superman-I"", ""Batman Returns"", and it's reboot. It opens with a fascinating ""travelogue"" to the hidden Island of the Amazons. ""Diana"" is truly unique, but does not know that she is the daughter of Zeus; not even told by her own mother. Curious that Amazons are almost invincible, but can be felled by a single lead bullet. The legend was changed as a man landing on the island should have taken away the women's powers. Also, I want to comment about Wonder Woman's costume. Briefer than a Trump statement yet un-revealing to all, like cheerleader ""spanky pants"". Perhaps aided by CGI? Now back to the movie. The Germans are even more evil than usual. The Amazons ""take no prisoners"" and even Wonder Woman kills off a lot of people. That's a different ""take"" than most DC heroes. The mad ""Dr. Maru"" wears a ""Phantom of the Opera"" mask and she creates hideous gases that promise uncontrollable strength and nightmarish execution. The film deserves it's PG-13 rating as it is quite violent (without being too overly graphic).""Ares"" the God of War, is disguised as an elderly British aristocrat. He will allow Mankind to destroy the Earth so that he can recreate it in his image of peace? A-1 in most respects, and if it doesn't ""run-away"" with several technical Oscars then the Academy is truly blind to mainstream films. Some of it is almost spellbinding and most of the roles are very well-cast. I suppose that a ""Clash of the Titans"" finish (Diana vs. Ares) was necessary, but as always, it's too grandiose and overdone. Does Diana ""drop a plane"" (no houses available) on evil Dr. Poison or not? (I failed to stay to the end of the titles for a possible ""Easter Egg"".) A great performance by Gal Gadot. Like most ""Batmans"", some of her chest is padded! She runs and leaps (aided by CGI) quite convincingly and looks the part as she does many of her own stunts. Chris Pine is a likable ""Bill Shatner-type"", and doesn't quite ""become"" his character ""Steve"". In ""Wonder Woman Magazine"" ""Ares"" cannot die, so I expect him to return again in spite of his apparent demise in this movie. Worth seeing on a big screen, so don't just wait for the Blu-Ray!","6 out of 20 found this helpful.

We already know the usual men's enjoyment concept from the comic book movie, where Batman fights Superman, or Captain America fights Iron Man, or Harley Quinn flaunts a sparkling tight thong. Now, a female superhero stars in her own female-directed movie, in armor built to expose her arms, legs, face, and shoulders!Does Wonder Woman automatically pass as certified fresh? Is it considered sexist to criticize a movie by a female director? No, and no.The first few moments progress with the velocity of a tuckered-out tortoise. It begins with our hero, Diana, remembering her childhood, when she felt inspired to fight for her fellow female warriors on their Zeus-created island. This repetitious, slow prologue only establishes facts that later get repeated.Things still start off rather slow in the first act, but women may love the immediate role reversal to give them well overdue credit. Right away Diana rescues a man from drowning, following a fight between the united Amazon women and a technologically advanced German army. These battles look less like the usual fan service kind of write-in, and more a choreographed ballet of steel mesh fit for the most committed of DC followers. The male viewers will offer praise as well, such as key scenes which tribute all the classics of guy's-night-in cinema, and a direct connection to Wayne Enterprises.The DC Universe could finally find its footing, yet improvement advances just by a hair compared to the loathed predecessors of the cinematic universe. The more forgetful characters here contribute nothing important, both in writing and direction, making the world around them equally shallow in cinematic exploration. The most accurate Greek mythology fact stated here is the women's birth origins from clay. Oh, and the island somehow coexists with the rest of the world, only accessible by a portal. It seems DC's cinematic universe cannot decide on its own reality.However, both the theme and artistry picks up from here. As the pilot/spy takes her from her home into civilization, he teaches her about his way of living as she arrives in London. The detail of her unfamiliarity parallels any immigrant arriving in a new home. As Diana takes on the city, fine dresses interfere with her ability to fight. She refuses to accept society's standards of being a lady, nor does she tolerate their form of government. From her experience, good generals fight amongst their other soldiers rather than sit in offices. She cleaves against her sword and shield, and sees the contradicting wide lacy indigo dresses as a straightjacket to her destiny. So, we can conclude one applicable takeaway: women empowerment means showing lots of skin. Does that also give women the right to sexualize their wardrobe along with practicing brute strength? Celebrating sexual freedom should never be a sign of fighting for others.Outside of the Israeli-Aztec heroine, the characters either hit or miss your memory as they come. Her spy/boyfriend works alongside a trio of soldiers who each voice strong opinions about bringing a woman on the battlefield with them. The first, a Moroccan, adds needed male flavor with his zesty interaction with the female hero. The other contributes sympathy as he generates a needed soul on the piano. The third, named ""Chief,"" gives a great backstory to America for Diana's understanding. Outside of the heroes, a great female villain, addressed as Dr. Poison, compels your curiosity of her backstory thanks to her hazy performance behind a secretive phantom mask. So what went wrong here? Their accents resemble two days' worth of dialect classes rather than someone who breathes the culture. If these American films continue to misrepresent other cultures, why bother attempting to please an international audience? After all, no one can buy into a Greek island of Amazon woman descended from Israel, Britain, and Africa.By the time the third act rolls into play, the drama declines as you come to realize how little puts Diana in a real mode of conflict. The surround sound sure enough shakes your seat, but the male villain she confronts belongs in Marvel's long index of forgetful final bosses.Should this define 21st century feminism? Should we celebrate making women feel empowered by blaming their problems on men? Wonder Woman focuses on painting women as the only true saints in the world, whilst all the men cause the world's problems. Ever heard of Aileen Wuornos? Whose biopic starring Charlize Theron was also directed by Patty Jenkins? Was she not responsible for all sorts of problems? Men are not the sole blame for chaos, pride is; which everyone who has ever lived and ever will live falls short of.","16 out of 43 found this helpful.

Although its creators playfully and conveniently mix Greek and Roman mythologies (names of Diana paired with Zeus and Ares, for example, and Ares rather than Apollo--who's not in the movie--laying claim to divine truthiness), the plot more than works and holds together logically. There is no foul language. In the Greek tradition, goriness is not shown ""on the stage."" The audience realizes that people have been decapitated, impaled, etc., but the gore is not shown, so girls will not run from the theater and boys will not get aroused by the wrong stuff. Diana is not a sexualized hero although she and the leading man are certainly sexual beings in the best and modest senses. Fighting is like the Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon sort, though not quite so ""Ninja."" A special effects Oscar is a definite probably. And the acting is SO good despite the fantasy element. The hero is like a combo of Pitt, Damon, and DiCaprio in their youth. The Amazonian accents are a little disarming, but since all the Amazons are supposedly polyglots, it's okay. And they do sound a little Israeli like the leading lady.This is a funny, laugh-out-loud script. The ending is inevitable since the script is honest and intelligent.

DC finally learned to make movies not too boring like they always do. The content was great and the mist interesting part of the movie was the action scenes. Sick and cool. The action scenes is one of the best on the planet. It was like a mixture of superhuman battle and some martial arts.

The rest was really bad, I don't understand how anybody can give this a positive review. Trying to avoid spoilers (not that it matters, there's not a single thing in the movie that you won't predict):1. Wonder Woman herself is basically invincible. Superman has Kryptonite, Batman has the no-killing thing, Wonder Woman though is a tank. Bullets just bounce off her and she has super-human strength, even against the bad guy who takes some sort of serum to make him stronger (which lasts all of about 1 minute of screen time). This makes the film boring and it lacks suspense as you know that nothing can happen to her.There are several scenes where people (men, of course) artificially tell her it's too dangerous for her to go somewhere / do something and you have to wonder why, as she is invulnerable to everything. No tension.2. The movie is extremely tasteless. The first World War was one of the most horrendous conflicts in human history, yet here Wonder Woman just strolls across No-Man's land deflecting machine gun and sniper fire without getting a scratch and single-handedly defeats any German soldier unfortunate enough to cross paths with her. Of course the allied soldiers then run after her and win the battle without taking any casualties. Completely disrespectful and it trivialises the war of attrition that was trench warfare in which so many millions died.3. The writers appear to have confused WW1 and WW2. The German soldiers are all dressed and act like Nazi's.4. One of the main characters commits suicide seemingly for the sheer joy of it.5. Dialogue inspired by Moana, I'm not kidding (""I am ... from ... and I have come here to ..."").6. Physics are thrown out of the window. For example a lot of the CGI lacks ""weight"" when showing people or objects hurtling through the air, and Wonder Woman strolls about at one point with a heavy sword slid down the back of an evening dress at a party (which incidentally, nobody actually notices and remarks upon).7. It's about 20 minutes too long and starts to drag towards the end.8. Luckily for the heroes that aren't Wonder Woman, the enemy soldiers can only aim when shooting at Wonder Woman (where all the bullets bounce straight off, see above). When shooting at any other participant of the movie's fellowship, they have the marksmanship of Storm Troopers from Star Wars. The good guys of course have perfect aim.9. Comedy-Villain German General randomly murders own officers for a laugh and nobody blinks an eye-lid.As I said at the start, it certainly does look pretty, so if all you want is some eye candy with lots of explosions for 2.5 hours, go for it. For everybody else though, it's just a bad comic book movie. There's basically nothing redeeming here.","12 out of 31 found this helpful.

I liked all, the director's cut for BvS is even one of my favorite films (look up my review), yet WW comes ""last"" despite doing many thing rights. Let's start with the positives: Gal presented great potential for being a unique action actress in Fast 5 and Snyder showed pure genius in casting her. A more fitting actress for Wonder Woman might not exist! Chris Pine equally delivered the strongest performance of his career, despite being given a role that frequently leads to nothing in the comics. A lot of his charm comes due to his chemistry with Diana and I would make a case for him being the ""real"" hero of the story, due to his willingness to go above and beyond the call of duty and keeping a cool head throughout. His actions in the 3rd act especially put a key moment in BvS in a new perspective... The whole cast is very good, with Apache Chief and Etta Candy (literally the first time I like the character!) standing out but I will admit that Steve's band of agents could have used 1 member less. Let's go with the highly clich√©d sniper, not that I truly disliked him. Dr. Poison and the actual god form of Ares were great too but more about the way the film reaches him later.The film is divided in 3 VERY different acts. The highly comic accurate first 40 minutes show Diana growing up on the hidden amazon island Themyscira. The way the film intermixes the 1987 Post Crisis comic reboot with the more violent New52 version is borderline perfect and i look forward to see the amazons again in JLA. The decision keep the Greek gods as actual gods is worthy of praise too, especially due to their universal recognition, but Suicide Squad and JLA also feature deities. I hope that a sequel can follow up on the mystical aspect of the film and Diana's heritage and form a connection to the New Gods in JLA. Not to derail into spoilers or complex comic canon. The 2nd act is a humorous fish out of water story, intermixed with social commentary and surface level insight into WW1 that is deep enough to work, without overtaxing an unfamiliar audience why the war was so complex. I suspect that this part of the film connected the most with audience but I like it the least. Much time is spend with Diana dressing up, attending war councils and setting up Steve's band of international men of mystery. Even the German side is shown a few times, to point out how bad the ""enemy's"" infantry has it. It also becomes easy to see why WW 1 was chosen over WW 2. It lacks true villains, while allowing the filmmakers to touch on the darker sides of war without going into bleak topics as concentration camps and how fascism swept Europe. Something The First Avenger completely sides-stepped by inventing a faceless enemy vaguely affiliated with the Nazis, to not offend international viewers. Sigh. This core portion of the film is undeniably an important step for the DCEU, as even I must admit that a truly lighthearted film needs to come sooner than later. We get glimpses of it here, yet i again found the 2nd act a bit unfocused. Especially if I consider how out of nowhere the 3rd act comes. This part is what seemingly connected least with audiences but it has the best scenes in the whole film, despite being a bit rough overall. I 100% get why the film handled the Ares reveal the way it did. The overall idea is clever but I don't think that the character of (the historic) Ludendorff was needed, not to go into spoilers. Dr. Poison should have been the single German villain, with proper glimpses of the actual God of War's machinations interspersed throughout the film to build him up, as he borderline comes out of nowhere. His proper confrontation with Diana and the fight are pure gold. Especially due to how dark the film is willing to go (WW sure kills a lot of poor grunts while going berserk). Imagine if Zod only showed up in the 3rd act of Man of Steel, with only talk about him before nearly the 2 hour mark. I love where the film ended up but the way there could have used a re-write, with a shorter 2nd act.It's still quite an achievement that such a serious, and frankly child inappropriate, film near universally managed to connect with audiences. The 3rd act is as dark as BvS or TDK and the film resembles the somewhat divisive MoS more than it does Superman 78. The slightly anti-chronological structure, the muddy color pallet and the relentless action scenes quickly betray Zack Snyder's fingerprint, in the same way Christoper Nolan loomed larger over MoS. Director Patty Jenkins should get more control over the next film and I hope for a much different follow-up but this Snyder X Jenkins ""cross-over"" undeniably worked. The main reason for WW getting a better reception than MoS is likely due to fewer expectations from the audience, as her (often changing) comic characterization and canon are largely unknown to the public. The film is also easier to ""digest"" than previous DCEU films but I will note that the last WW feature, an animated movie from 2009, is neither better nor worse than this first cinematic solo outing. One of many more to come, so I look forward to Diana being the deuteragonist of JLA and the star if her solo franchise. I lastly recommend to rediscover her in the Ultimate Cut of BvS. The film may surprisingly grow on you on 2nd viewing.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

Man Of Steel would have been fine if Super Man was actually super, he only won by pure luck. Batman vs Super Man did nothing other from make us like Lois. If it was cannon to the dark knight series then things may be better but it isn't. However, after the amount of sexism from Ghostbusters, people actually rated Wonder Woman a high score.It was one of the best DC films, I'm not a DC fan to be honest, Marvel is better but on this occasion, Wonder Woman did a fantastic job. The villains, fights and settings were all perfect. Although I'm attracted to hundreds of girls, I don't have much of an opinion on Gal Gadot other from the fact that she's a good actress. Wonder Woman is one of the better DC characters, followed by Bane and Batman. Anyone who liked Wonder Woman can now re-watch Ghostbusters and say that is was fine and not terrible. Like, it beat the second original one. I loom forward to the Wonder Woman sequel and seeing her in Justice League. Ares was a cool villain.","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

In other words, no one was yelling ""LOOK, I'M A WOMAN AND I'M STRONG""; their strength was displayed in their action. For me, the best parts were the fighting sequences (especially the battles on Themyscira and No Man's Land), Wonder Woman's compassion for people (in a time where women were suppressed, she stood tall because she understood/embraced her purpose), the ""fish out of water"" plot was done well, Diana and Steve's chemistry (their banter was hilarious; kudos to Gal and Chris), Queen Hippolyta and General Antiope were awesome (Connie Nielsen and Robin Wright were amazing) and most of all, the Amazonians were diverse, which is socially relevant nowadays. A few scenes moved a little too slow for me, which I can overlook as I feel that happens with most origin stories I watch. Overall, I LOVED this film; the only person that loved it more than me is my 8 year old daughter.

However, what keeps Wonder Woman strong is its interesting story, characters, and world building. It has a 2 sided argument between man's and woman's world and it's very well balanced. The characters have real conversations now and not like a bunch of cut board robots. The tone and style of the film presents Wonder Woman in an accurate way. There's colorful cinematography that reminds audience of the first Superman films. Although, it may not look like true technicolor was used, it's still breathtaking to watch. The action is standard to above average. There's several moments of distracting slow motion, but it's not abused compared to 300. The visual effects or fine, sometimes they will be very distracting, but it's a movie about gods and superhero people. Of course there will be a lot of CGI. There's a whole lot of good DC has got right instead of bad, but they still need to work on their marketing skills and fix things the MCU has not fixed. There are three villains in Wonder Woman and they are all rushed with barely much screen time. They are not underdeveloped to the extent of Doomsday in BvS, but they are wasted potential for sure. The performances are average to good, Gal Gadot does a good job as Wonder Woman, except for one over-dramatic part in the final battle. The best performer is Chris Pine as Steve Trevor. He brings a shred of charm and courage to the film and he is a great side man for Wonder Woman. Robin Wright and Connie Nielsen also do great jobs as convincing mentors of Diana. The villain performers on the other hand very much overcooked their performances. They were over the top and they weren't all that great. Where the movie falls and rises is the third act. The final battle adds tons of heart and character to Wonder Woman as well as the message the film accumulates to, but like any other superhero flick, a wasted villain. Do not be surprised if the villain twist was so predictable, I blame it on early Wonder Woman marketing that Warner Bros. didn't keep as a secret. Overall, I give it a 7.6/10. Definitely the best superhero flick so far this year.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

But her dialogue delivery wasn't quite convincing. The weird Amazonian accents didn't add up. But the best cast was definitely Chris Pine as Steve Trevor. He gave a genuine performance. The music was pretty good.The action was well composed and the heroine stances from Gal was pretty cool to watch. The chemistry between Gal & Chris was solid and funny but sometimes a little exaggerated.

The DC comics were trash to me, including Wonder Woman. And I've almost never enjoyed any of the DC movies. So why did I enjoy this one?Gal GadotThat was easy, right? I would pay admission to watch her read from the dictionary for two hours. But she was also perfect as Wonder Woman. I can't imagine anyone else ever playing that part. They'd better retire the character when Gal Gadot either gets too old or no longer wants to play Diana. And, holy crap, sunshine in a DC movie? Who'd have thought that was possible?The rest of the cast was excellent, too. Chris Pine does an excellent job. Ewen Bremner is great for comedy relief and compassion. I won't name everyone, but they were all perfectly cast. I have to agree with the critics who say the exposition and origin story was WAAAAAYYYY too long. It's worth enduring, though, for the rest of the movie. And although I noticed the occasional Social Justice Warrior preaching in the movie, it was easy to overlook. Anyway, easily an 8/10, and a fine exception to the normal DC garbage. Correction: I admit, I did enjoy the first Batman with Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. Every Batman movie after that was horrible.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Patty Jenkins Wonder Woman played by Gal Gadot is a thrill ride that lives up to the hype. I have been very critical of the first 2 DCEU movies and came in to this one hoping that they would give Wonder Woman some justice after she helped save Superman v Batman. The origin story of Wonder Woman has always fascinated me and they give you her beginnings in this movie. While I would like to have seen more of the story focused on this aspect they did an excellent job of setting the stage with the time they had. Gal Gadot gets an A+ for her performance as Wonder Woman. She brought to that character a brilliant balance of; honor, duty, imagination and strength all while adhering to an innocence that made her that much more likable. It was a refreshing portrayal of an iconic hero that allowed me to simply enjoy without the rhetoric of sexism, racism and all the complaining in the world. Chris Pine also gets an A+ for his role as Steve. I applaud him for setting aside his ego and playing the 2nd lead to Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman. As for the negatives or things I did not agree with. There is a stolen plot from a MCU movie in the finale act that I would have went in a different direction. More emphasis on her home island and there was one antagonist who was misused. Other than that Wonder Woman is a great movie to see while in theaters and will not leave you disappointed.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Not to be outdone, Gal Gadot makes us forget for a moment the classic Lynda Carter of the 1970s and does not even make us think about the only female protagonist of a DC movie, Halle Berry. The story is clear, it takes you from beginning to end directly, here there is no time to introduce the profile of the character on the screen! - sorry David Ayer. The plot is divided into two parts and follows what is proposed, development and conclusion, a prime factor that was not seen in this new phase of DC films and that left the fans afraid to embark on a new journey.Wonder Woman fulfills what it promises and Gal Gadot further confirms the rise of the new female characters that are appearing on the screens of the theaters.

I don't know why they focus the war crap, what the heck with plain war, why cant they give the better meaning? didn't wonder woman got lot things to express? Support character is like ""what?"", villain is bullshit, even the boss is just pop!! and suddenly die,half of the movie is nonsense, not important,no meaning and non memorial, and after you finish it you will forget almost of the movie.DC make a bad move here. I guess they didn't learn a single things what magic that happen in dark knight and man of steel. They focus too much with Justice League to compete with Marvel. Epicness is not here, just a bitter taste.DC you shouldn't stay in the past success. your glory days is the proof of downfall, get over it.why cant you go for the future? you really have tons of nice story, only that alone can easily beat marvelI have to say all DC hero needs Nolan.Seriously, he's the only one that know how make the real DC hero movie.4 is my best, with a generously as DC fan otherwise I will give just 2DC I know you can be lots better than this.if you not, ask Nolan do it please...","10 out of 25 found this helpful.

The supporting characters were also just as interesting.

Reviewers on IMDb seem to either love it or hate it. There doesn't appear to be much middle-ground. Well, put me in the ""love it"" category. It's not perfect, but I found it supremely entertaining with a terrific lead actress and a compelling story (up to a point).Entertaining - For me, the 2+ hours just flew by. From Diana's backstory as a small child growing up on the Island full of Amazons to her first steps off the island to her battles with the Germans, it was pretty much a thrill-a-minute. And I appreciate the fact that the filmmakers decided to inject some humor. My biggest complaint with most of DCs other efforts is the complete lack of anything remotely funny. They're dark and depressing - and as a general rule, dark and depressing do not equal entertaining in my book.Lead Actress, Gal Gadot - What a woman! As someone who adored Lynda Carter in the Wonder Woman TV series, I'm glad Gadot resembles Carter. It made it easier for me to believe in her performance. And what a performance it was! For someone with a relatively limited acting background, I thought she was magnificent. She held her own acting- wise. Her comedic timing was spot-on. She delivered some of the best deadpan funny lines I've heard in a long time. And her ability to be at least somewhat convincing in the fight scenes was a real plus. She's just amazing!The Story - I enjoyed most all of the plot. If I have one complaint, it's with the film's ending. The whole god vs god thing at the end just didn't work on me. There was too much CGI and too little storytelling. But, as evidenced by my rating, it wasn't enough to spoil the entire movie for me. I was having way too much fun to let this get in the way. And up to that point, the plot worked for me. I bought the rest of Wonder Woman's story hook, line, and sinker. They made her a believable, real character - something that's hard to do with a superhero. Sure, there were holes and illogical things going on, but as I've repeatedly said, when it's this much fun, who cares?","4 out of 13 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Finally DC Makes a Halfway Decent Film!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3720943/?ref_=tt_urv","bkrauser-81-311064","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur26591649/?ref_=tt_urv","31 May 2017","Part of the problem with the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) is it often feels like it's beholden to a lot of different masters. From the get go, it needed to be immediately palpable to mainstream audiences while throwing in enough fan-service for those who knew every esoteric piece of increasingly convoluted mythology. It then needed to balance that same mythology on the backs of a multitude of reoccurring characters, a plethora of converging themes, a gauntlet of story dynamics and, because the whole circus had the unmistakable tinge of a franchise geared towards Monster swilling, Call of Duty playing, insecure 13-year-olds, it also throws in pretentious amounts of Philosophy 101 under the auspice of being ""mind-blowing"". Add to all that Warner Bros.'s desire to copy Marvel while emphatically denying they're copying Marvel, and their pesky need to, you know, keep the lights on, it's become pretty clear they've bitten off a lot more than they can chew.Thankfully Wonder Woman douses the still raging dumpster fire that is the DCEU with a tall glass of soothing bio-luminescent water. It takes out half the algebra, concentrates on the basics and leaves you with a singularly excellent movie. It's not perfect, and it may not give DC the course correction it truly needs but it still conjures memories of Christopher Reeves's Superman (1978) in the best possible sense. So for now I say, stand aside superherodom, Wonder Woman has finally arrived and boy is it about d**n time.Nearly the entirety of Wonder Woman takes place before the events of BvS: Electric Boogaloo (2016); which places our titular character on the island of Themyscira somewhere between Ancient Antiquity and the early twentieth century. It's established early on that Diana (Gadot) is a near-immortal, living in relative peace with her mother Queen Hippolyta (Nielsen), her aunt General Antiope (Wright) and the rest of her Amazonian peers.That is until the day Steve Trevor (Pine), a roguish American pilot and British Intelligence spy, crash lands on the shores of the island and fills everyone in on The Great War (WWI). Hearing that millions of innocents have already been slaughtered, Diana concludes that Ares, the mythical God of War, must be behind all the carnage and vows to stop him. It's a simplistic and naive worldview that Steve doesn't truly buy, but she saved his life and can kill him in nearly a hundred ways..so off they go to stop the war.Now there are many reasons to celebrate the arrival of Wonder Woman. It's a controlled and structured narrative (emphasis on the word: structured) that sustains itself with interesting, believable characters, organic fish-out-of-water humor and a clear black hat, white hat binary. It introduces Diana as a source of both physical and inner strength and never thinks to undermine that strength in the service of cultural appeasement. It includes both the best and most far-fetched aspects of Wonder Woman's mythos, while grounding everything in reality and, and here's the greatest part, the movie makes it all look easy. This thing isn't molded with the jagged edges of plot contrivances and misplaced bluster but rather meets its overall serious tone with a simple story that's ironically about the complexities of human nature.If we're being honest though, the whole enterprise would arguably be for not, if it wasn't in the capable hands Gal Gadot. She takes what could have been a female Superman clone and turns Diana into a fun, engaging character who's energy is bolstered by her determinism and purity of heart. She not only brings a level of command and natural chemistry to the party, she also brings a physicality to the role which was only hinted at in BvS: The Silent Killer, because it's hard to pit your Kung Fu kickboxing, capoeira, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and swordsmanship skills against a CGI ug-monster.Which brings me to the movies third act which, by in-large sticks the landing but fits a little too comfortably in the ""hero v large, fake-looking monster"" box. Worse still, because the film cashes in on the audience's goodwill to relay what might come across as a sappy mission statement, many may feel Wonder Woman's character change is loose and unearned. I'd argue that by simply stressing an economy of thought (there's also a love story at play, let's not forget) in what is essentially a summer popcorn flick, the overall product should be met with appreciation if not applause.Okay DC bro's you can stop complaining no one likes your movies Maybe I'm just so used to the DCEU s**tting the bed on a regular basis, that finding halfway decent sheets with hospital corners feels like a godsend. In the months to come, the faults may loom larger and the positives may dissipate in a cloud of noxious bat gas. For now though, I'm going to safely announce that Wonder Woman is unarguably the best in the franchise and I'll also put a little skin in the game by saying this movie will stand the test of time.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

""Man of Steel"" was a nice enough movie that, like Superman, struggled to find its place, ""Batman v Superman"" was a polarizing flick that was too ambitious for its own good, and ""Suicide Squad"" was an entertaining film that lacked cohesion. Then along came ""Wonder Woman"", which I can confidently say restored my faith. For a character that started as an icon of feminism and is a member of the Trinity, it's shocking how long it took for the heroine to grace the big screen (with only a 70s live-action series and a 2009 animated solo film to speak of) without any involvement with the Justice League; personally, I blame DC's over-reliance on Batman and Superman and bad experience with female superhero movies (*cough* Catwoman).Plot: Diana is the princess of the Amazons who has lived in peace on the hidden island of Themyscira until soldier Steve Trevor crash lands and tells of World War 1. Unwilling to let innocents suffer and suspecting powers greater than man at work, she goes with Steve to fight evil, but as she does she learns what lies beyond her home and what dwells within all of humanity.From beginning to end I was impressed. The film understands the core of Wonder Woman's character and what she represents, the potential for greatness in all of us in the face of adversity. Gal Gadot nails it, not only being bad-ass, but also bringing much needed depth and charm to her role. I can't help but smile at her innocent and well-meaning view of the world. Chris Pine was perfectly cast as Steve Trevor as well; just seems like a role he was born to play. The two share a very believable chemistry the way they play off each other such as their questions of how their respective worlds work and what do they know about life. The rest of the cast holds up well, offering some nice dynamics and even a humorous moment here and there. In fact, none of the comedy feels forced like in ""Suicide Squad"", feeling more natural especially given the time period. The story has this interesting shift in its tone and color throughout, starting from the beauty and innocence of Themyscira to the dreary ugliness of the outside world to the hopefulness of the future. Diana's journey reflects this as well, developing in the best way possible into the hero she was meant to be. It's clear that the writers and director knew exactly what they were doing and I give them props.The action scenes are a great spectacle, especially with the now iconic Wonder Woman theme playing in the background adding to the excitement, with lots of good choreography involving a mix of classic fantasy combat and modern warfare. Even better is that they each serve their purpose in the story rather than being there just for the hell of it. There are some surprising twists I didn't see coming, especially when it came to the villains (who are grim reflections of the real world and each entertaining in their own right), and moments that are both heartwarming and heartbreaking.As of yet, I can't think of anything negative about the film unlike the other ones. As of yet, this is the best DCEU film ever made and it gave me more investment in seeing more to come. Go ahead and see ""Wonder Woman"", but don't expect any after-credit scene.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Wonder Woman ‚Äì DC finally finds its feet","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3759537/?ref_=tt_urv","bowmanblue","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur1406466/?ref_=tt_urv","20 July 2017","In case you're not aware of the 'shared cinematic universe' wars that are going on in the cinemas, I'll try and put it simply. One studio makes superhero films that everyone seems to love. Another studio makes superhero films that you'd think the same audience would loves, but everyone seems to hate. And there you have my brief history of 'Marvel' and 'DC.' Wonder Woman falls into the 'DC bracket' and fans have already expressed their disapproval with DC's previous attempts at getting all their most famous heroes together on the big screen with the various Superman and Suicide Squad films, some even saying that DC's 'shared cinematic universe' is already dead in the water. However, just when it looked like this franchise was as dead as the new General Zod, along comes Gal Gadot as the titular Wonder Woman. And, just as most people agreed that the other DC films don't work, now most people seem to agree that Wonder Woman is awesome! I have to say that I agree, but then maybe I'm easily pleased as I also really liked Batman versus Superman and Suicide Squad! I've never read the comics, but I believe the film is a little different here and there. Apparently, they've changed her origins and set the story in World War I as opposed to WWII. Apparently, that did irk some people, but my lack of backstory knowledge of the source material meant that I never noticed! Anyway, we meet Diana (aka Wonder Woman) on her Amazonian island as a child. We see her obsess over becoming like the warrior women she idolises and yearns to join them in their eternal fight against the forces of darkness. Don't worry. This doesn't last for long. It's pretty tedious and definitely the low-point of the whole film. In fact, it could quite easily have been cut and no one would have really noticed. All it feels like is pointless exposition. However, like I say, it doesn't last long and Diana quickly grows up in time to rescue crashed Allied fighter pilot Captain Kirk from his stricken plane as it nose dives in the sea (or rather Chris Pine, anyway).And from then on it's pretty non-stop. You have everything you can want from a superhero movie. Despite Gal Gadot's inexperience with acting (I believe she's primarily a model), she plays the character perfectly. She's one part fish out of water as she arrives in the 'real' world and interacts with people who weren't raised without war on a paradise island. But she's never totally na√Øve. You cannot help but root for her as she's just so damn likable without ever been a goody-two-shoes. Then there's the chemistry with Kirk ‚Äì sorry, Pine ‚Äì they bounce off each other brilliantly. And the characters are seamlessly woven into expert direction when it comes to the fight scenes ‚Äì after all, Wonder Woman is literally going to war and the scene where she charges an entire German trench sends goosebumps down your arms ‚Äì it's that good.If there is a negative it's the beginning, plus an annoying comedy relief character (you'll spot her straight away), but thankfully both bad elements are brief. This is normally the point where I say that fans of superhero movies will love this. And, although I believe that to be true, I reckon that Wonder Woman is the kind of film where pretty much anyone who enjoys good cinema should enjoy it, plus ‚Äì special shout-out to the weird grinding soundtrack that seems to come on every time Diana fights (it's weird and definitely as memorable to the action as other classic tunes such as the Bond and Indiana Jones themes).After a shaky start DC are finally off and running. And this can only be good to give Marvel a bit of competition at the Box Office. Bring on Wonder Woman 2 (or was that technically Batman versus Superman?!).","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The chemistry between Diana and Steve is nice.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

When I learned that Zack Snyder had his fingers in it I got a worried since he recently wrote such atrocities as Batman vs Superman and sure enough the story is a really the weakest part of the movie. A typical nonsensical, unintelligent, Hollywood story/script were you are better off putting your brain in idle when watching it.However it makes up for this with cool special effects and, surprisingly, quite enjoyable characters. This is definitely a movie that you watch for the sake of the special effects. Well, if you are a male teenager you might also be watching it to drool over Gal Gadot of course (I have to admit that she is hot).There is not too much to say about the plot. Our Amazon hot chick discovers that there is a war going on and goes out to stop it. Since she has been overly protected by her guardian she is amazingly clueless about life outside of her little island. Especially aspects involving men. Something which creates some funny moments as well as some embarrassingly silly ones. This, Diana's gradual evolution where she not only is learning about life but also discovers her considerable powers, is one of the enjoyable aspects of the movie though. It is of course also one of the dummer aspects of the movie. How the f¬Ö could the Amazon Queen race Diana to be so ignorant about everything?Another not so enjoyable part of the movie is the ludicrous scenes where the britts are trying to obtain peace at all costs as well as the stereotypical portrayal of Ludendorff as some megalomaniacal, half crazy war-mongerer. This was just dumb. I guess Zac Snyder just picked the name out of some history book without bothering to read up on the character. Typical lack of intelligence and respect, a la Hollywood, for anything outside of their, very limited, sphere of knowledge. Well, at least Danny Huston did a pretty decent job of the shitty role he was given. So did most of the rest of actors. I definitely liked Gal Gadot as Super Woman but then, although I am not a teenager, I am still a male so maybe I am biased when it comes to her?I definitely liked the special effects. The showdown at the end was great as far as I am concerned and the rest not bad either. They could have been even better though if it would not have been so obvious that the Germans where mostly incompetent extras waiting for Wonder Woman to show off her gymnastics and slow motion abilities. Come on, even superhero special effects should make some pretense of being ""realistic"" superhero special effects.The movie is definitely aimed at the young adult segment. Unfortunately it do not seem to know what it is aiming for. Sometimes it is almost adult, sometimes it is late teen and sometimes just so bloody TV-show silly that you're wondering if it is aiming for even pre-teens.Anyway, regardless of its faults I did enjoy my 2+ hour spent on this movie. Enough to give it a 4 out of 5 rating","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

While the plot is similar to the first Captain America - because they're both origin stories, and set in the WW1 - WW2 era -, the action and atmosphere are much better.There is no extreme feminist agenda here, WW is simply a woman who sees something wrong and has the power and the will to take action against it. Gal Gadot performs her role beautifully, acting as a woman who's both tactful and a pacifist by nature, while displaying amazing battle prowess and her supernatural powers in beautiful combat choreography when required. But she never boasts, never shows any kind of negative pride or a desire to look down on others. Her abilities, wit and intellect flow off of her naturally. By her actions, or lack thereof, she earns the respect of the men around her, and the viewers on the other side of the screen.The plot is nothing special, but since when is it ever when it comes to superhero flicks? It's not bad either, and the storytelling and visuals are more than good enough to deliver a thoroughly entertaining experience. While the movie suffers from a few scenes with merely average CGI, and a few clich√©s too, which bring the score down to 8 for me, the fact remains that WW had multiple scenes that literally rocked so hard that I and my friends got goosebumps more than once.Knowing Gal Gadot's background as a woman trained (and training others) in Israeli defense forces, someone who was not simply happily building her career on her looks and beauty competitions alone, but wanted more - someone who walked their own way through life, who went and earned her success with more than just her looks and sex -, the connection to the way she portrays Wonder Woman is especially strong and meaningful. It's an incredibly rare thing to see women on screen that are effortlessly beautiful, feminine, and genuinely nice and likable, yet have such powerful leadership charisma, obvious strength of will and character, and a great sense of purpose all at the same time. Which is exactly what Wonder Woman is supposed to be.In conclusion I have to say that I went in with some high expectations, and still came out positively surprised. I can honestly recommend this movie to anyone. And while I don't want to go on about political agendas here, it has to be said: If there has ever been a perfect figurehead for real feminism for grown-ups and children alike in the world of movies and entertainment, this is it. Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. No complaining, no excuses, just attitude, hard work, and passion. She sees something she wants, and she does it. Herself. Period.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

After the plot holes of Man of Steel and the disappointments of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad, the Patty Jenkins directed Wonder Woman is the first DC movie to be, at least, on level with the films being churned out for the Marvel cinematic universe. Additionally, as the first live-action superhero movie led by a woman both as the protagonist and the director, Wonder Woman, which comes out June 2, is well worth your local theater's ticket price.For those not familiar with Wonder Woman's story, audiences are introduced to Princess Diana (aka Wonder Woman), played by Lilly Aspell (8) and Emily Carey (12), as the only child living on the secret Amazon-inhabited island of Themyscira. She desperately wants to become a warrior like the superhuman women who surround her, but her mother, Queen Hippolyta (played by Connie Nielsen), tries her hardest to forbid it. Predictably, Diana betrays her mother's wishes and becomes the strongest Amazonian and most bad-ass woman the world has ever seen. At the peak of her training, a World War I Central Powers fighter pilot-slash-Allies spy, Steve Trevor (played by Chris Pine), crashes into the ocean off the shores of the hidden island of Themyscira, sparking Diana's adventures in the world of men and war.Read More: https://www.ljlaffend.com/single-post/2017/06/01/Review- Wonder-Woman","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Gal Gadot brings to it a simple innocence and 'clean slate' sort of feel to the whole DCEU. For once, this hero had no excess baggage and just wanted to do the right thing.There's a lot other positive things that can be said about WW, but mainly the fact that we finally get a female superhero as the lead, in her own solo film, and what a good film it is, who is not seen as the sexy character, or the stupid 'i don't know how the world works' character, or one who needs help from her man (although she did get help, it wasn't because she needed it, it was because the world needed it).

"8","/10","The DCEU has FINALLY hit a home run!","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3722704/?ref_=tt_urv","CriticomLink_YT","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur51024511/?ref_=tt_urv","3 June 2017","Wonder Woman is the fourth film in the DCEU and takes place during World War One, therefore placing it before the events of the previous DCEU entries. It is the first female-led superhero film, as Patty Jenkins takes on the role of director and Gal Gadot stars as the titular superhero. On top of that, it's the first theatrically- released live action adaptation of the character of Wonder Woman. Chris Pine portrays Steve Trevor, and the films also stars Robin Wright as General Antiope, Danny Huston as General Ludendorff, David Thewlis as Ares, Connie Nielsen as Queen Hippolyta, Elena Anaya as Doctor Poison, and Lucy Davis as Etta Candy.I'll just start right off the bat; Wonder Woman is a triumph for the DCEU and the best DC film since The Dark Knight, no question. Wonder Woman hits such a glorious home run that I almost got out of my seat and started cheering. And this is the darn truth, half of the people in my theater gave the film a standing ovation when the credits started rolling. But why? Well let me tell you. When it comes to films that are centered around one character in a vast multi-verse, it is imperative that the filmmakers get that character right. Wonder Woman is written by Zack Snyder, Allan Heinberg and Jason Fuchs and portrayed by Gal Gadot superbly. Her entire dynamic screams ""fish-out-of-water,"" and those types of characters are the ones I find to be easily relatable. As Diana Prince walks along the streets of London, marveling at the fashion popular at the time, or witnesses soldiers coming home from the war, battered and broken, you can relate to her. She isn't some experienced veteran who's used to seeing brutality like this, or some fashion supernova, she is a minnow in a pond chock full of piranhas. A minnow capable of cracking open a can of whoop-ass whenever she feels like it, I might add. The characterization of Wonder Woman/Diana Prince is unmatched in this Extended Universe, and that's complemented by Gal Gadot's colossally charismatic performance. Gadot exhibits on-point line delivery and excellent displays of emotion, and this is her best work to date in my opinion.Chris Pine also put on a great performance as Steve Trevor, and the romance between Trevor and Diana was satisfyingly investing and not sappy, as the main romance is one of the most common areas where superhero movies fall flat, but not when it comes to this film. Everyone else put on really good or great performances, with Lucy Davis particularly shining.On the flip side of substance, the visual/CGI effects were top- notch, although there were some parts that boasted uneven CGI (specifically the fire effects). However, one particular department I must single out is the stunt work. The stunts are amazing, and something I can appreciate is that Patty Jenkins does not use varying camera angles to mask the not-so-spectacular stunts. Not that that's a bad thing, cause even the worst stunts were still good. That tells you how dedicated Jenkins was to this project, and I dearly hope that she helms more films in the DCEU. Now back to what I was previously discussing, the fighting sequences themselves are something to behold. Unlike Captain America: Civil War, where there were some fighting scenes worth complaining about, I can't recall one dull moment of action throughout this entire film. The action and fighting sequences kept me on the edge of my seat throughout this movie's run time, while the drama rarely ever lets up. Dang, what a gem this is.Is Wonder Woman just as great as The Dark Knight? No. But it does come close. Overall, Wonder Woman is a standout among the DCEU. Not just because it's colorful and not a depression-inducing shade of gray, but the film's handling and representation of the iconic titular character is unparalleled. Wonder Woman/Diana Prince is both a fierce warrior and a curious individual, determined to restore peace to mankind and learn all about their ways of life as well. Intensely terrific action, a cohesive plot, a satisfying main romance, and a colorful tone with serious elements all gel together to form my favorite film of 2017 so far. Whether you're a long-time fan of the character, or recently introduced, you'll get your money's worth and more with the DCEU's magnum opus, and hopefully this will set an example for the folks at DC in the years to come.Rating - 8.4/10 stars","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

The plot set in WWI is super-dumb, generic, and well, Gal Gadot is very pretty. The first hour felt really loong stretched and extremely boring. The rest of the movie is just boring and the fighting scenes are all a terrible awful composed overloaded cgi-feast. How this movie gets such a high rate, and especially even by the IMDb staff is a mystery to me. But lately, I noticed that many movies I didn't like at all were rated high by IMDb staff - Wonder Woman got a 8.0 and the last King Arthur a 7.7 by IMDb staff. Really!? For comparison - a masterpiece like Apocalypse Now is rated 8.4 by IMDb staff. King Arthur and Wonder Woman are not even on the same planet as the dark vision of Mr. Coppola.For me IMDb loses it's creditability rapidly. Wonder Woman like King Arthur - mediocre movies at best. A rating of 8 or higher!? Ridiculous.Some reviewers call this the best D.C. output so far - well, if this is the best D.C. can do, the company should pull back from movie bizz and focus on publishing comics again.But I will confess, if I would be still aged around 10 or 12 I maybe would like Wonder Woman more.Last but not least, the main theme, the setting of a woman fighting in the trenches of WWI is just a recycled idea - Mr. Zack Snyder did this already in Sucker Punch and the execution of the fighting scene there is zillion times better done. Even too lazy to write an original script for such a big production... Disappointing.Anti-Fake-Rate: 1 Real rate: 5","8 out of 19 found this helpful.

I was one of those skeptical people after Superman vs. Batman. I was heartened by the choice of Director Patty Jenkins. As the cast started rounding out and names like David Thewlis started popping up I became more hopeful. This film far exceeded my expectations. Gal Gadot was, of course, everything she was supposed to be and more: strong while still being feminine, engaging, smart, believable and of course beautiful. Robin Wright who I mistakenly had thought was going to play her mother was incredible. Jenkins knows women and obviously respects them. The Amazons were racially mixed and that was a welcome surprise that shouldn't be overlooked. Chris Pine is so reliable. He anchored his portrayal of Steve Trevor in charm, longing, and humor. His chemistry with Gal Gadot worked thru and thru. Of course, David Thewlis couldn't give a bad performance if he tried and Lucy Davis was perfect as Etta Candy. The big question of how they were going to deal with the time frame and get her back to the Justice League and Superman vs. Batman era was answered in the first five minutes. Jenkins knows women and obviously respects them. I thought the fight scenes were shot with originality and purpose. Not once did I mix up who was who or lose sight of Wonder Woman. Patty Jenkins could teach some of these other directors a thing or two about staging. Way back when I was a reader of comic books and knew Wonder Woman's story thru and thru and was not offended by any changes this adaptation brought. In fact, I thought unlike some liberties that were taken in the past, they were an improvement. Sticking with my usual review practice of (trying to) not give anything away I will simply say: Go see this one. you won't be disappointed.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Some of the references from The Little Mermaid in which the main character explores the outside world and becomes fascinated (calling it ""fish out of water"") is also a good inclusion. Chris Pine, Connie Nielsen, and Danny Huston does give a good performances but Danny Huston's performance is somehow intimidating.Even the action sequences, it's mind-blowing with slow-motion references from The Matrix that makes the movie cool and the pacing is also good. Plus, the musical score even the thematic tune is bombastic.But the flaw in this movie is that it gives too much exposition, David Thewlis somehow fell a bit flat in his performance though not terrible.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

Patty Jenkins brought the amazon princess to life!!!The movie starts in present day (after the events of BvS:Dawn of Justice). Diana receives a picture from Bruce Wayne (the photo was seen in BvS), and begins to reminisce about what led to that photo of her being taken during WWI (yes,, the first world war).Diana was raised on Themyscira, Island of the Amazons. Her mother, Hippolyta, ruled the Amazons as queen. As Diana grows up, she is trained to be a warrior, as all the Amazons are.Themyscira is hidden from the outside world, but like all things hidden, it cannot stay that way forever. One day, while admiring the ocean view, Diana sees a small engine plane crash not far from their shore. Without hesitation, Diana dives into water and rescues the pilot from drowning. The pilot's name is Steve Trevor,, and he's an American working as a spy for British Intelligence in WWI,, and he's being closely pursued by the German forces,,,I've been reading a lot of the reviews that say this movie is boring, and that Gal Gadot's acting was terrible,,, I don't know what movie they were watching or what they were expecting. (I'll agree there was one or two moments that I thought could've been acted better,, but then again I remembered that the character Diana has led a pretty sheltered life. Maybe Jenkins and Gadot were playing into that part of the character,, idk) I thought the movie was excellent all around! Gal Gadot is Diana Prince imo. She just looks exactly like what you'd imagine Wonder Woman would look like,, and I thought she portrayed her very well. The rest of the cast was great as well, including Pine, Houston, and Thewlis especially. I especially enjoyed the recreation of WWI and the creation of Themyscira (loved the Amazon warriors!!!).

This feels like an organized act to vote this movie down. Never seen it like that on imdb though. Must have something to do with the strong female lead, it's really hard to explain this irrational behavour any other way. The movie is good, even if you don't like the actors or the premise, you should be able to admit that acting, action and story were solid, especially for a superhero film. No major plot holes, no stupid kung-fu fights, no inconsistend logic or powers. In many of these bad reviews there's a lot of complaining about the writing, but none of them explains how the writing is bad. I've seen the movie twice and I really couldn't tell you either. There are a few flaws in this film (like the formulaic structure), and if anyone doesn't like it because of them, i get that. But if you are male and don't really have logical reasons for hating on that movie, I guess you should check if it isn't your own insecurity that's responsible for that. Because it feels like there are some really frightened boys writing rewiews here, when they really should be dealing with their fears.
In my oppinion Wonder Woman is on the same level as the better offerings of Marvel. Highly recommended.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I had to wait for decades, but it seems that the world was ready for this. ""Wonder Woman"" immediately loudly declared itself. And it is clear why. This picture is designed to raise important gender issues in addition to entertainment. The place of women in this world, especially how they were treated some hundred years ago.The picture shows two different worlds: the world of Amazons and the world of people. This is clearly visible on the screen with the help of the proposed picture. On the island of Temiskira, these are bright and warm colors, the splendor of plants and the blue sea. In the world of people, these are faded tones, dirt and smoke everywhere. You can feel this cold right on you. In my opinion, the director perfectly managed to convey such two different worlds. It's a kind of message. Themyscira is a world of harmony with nature that people once had. The second world is a world of wars and constant conflicts between people and nature.Director Patty Jenkins has put on a beautiful picture. She asks questions to the modern world through the prism of a raging war, in which she places Diana. She is naive and does not yet know our world well. Therefore, we hear naive questions from her throughout the film, but they are very correct, they make us think.Gal Gadot perfectly demonstrates the image of Wonder Woman. Especially when you involuntarily compare it with her own game of ""BpS"". There she is wise and has seen a lot. In the same film, everything is new to her. She is simple and honest, somewhere soft enough. Gadot perfectly demonstrates this on the screen.Chris Pine is slightly ambiguous in the role of Steve Trevor. A contradictory feeling remained. He seemed to me a flat hero, but Pine is good, his task is done. He's such a good guy, as befits the main character.The visual component is at a height. The picture is beautiful, even those very scenes of war. Each frame is exposed as it should be. There is a lot of action, it is created with love and attention to detail. Humor is enough. Not a lot and not a little. The music is good. In my opinion, of course, the work of Hans Zimmer is missing, but his main theme can be traced in the accompaniment of the film, making reference to the existing film universe.The film ""Wonder Woman"" is perfect for young people and especially girls, it will teach you to be strong and at the same time truly feminine. I definitely recommend it for viewing.9 out of 10.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

Even the training scenes are great. It was really cool to see the Amazons training and fighting, and I liked that some of them are real fighters. I liked the horse tricks, too, which reminded me of the Cossack riders of the Moscow Circus. The Amazon costumes look good while still being practical to fight in. The horrors of WWI trench warfare are shown, including the big guns, the gas, and the wounded coming back from the front. Diana has been trying to reach the front to achieve her goal, but she doesn't stay hung ho when Chief tells her the sound she thought was thunder was the sound of the war.There's a moment in the trench scene when Trevor tells her, ""This is No Man's Land. That means no man can cross it."" I was sure she was about to say ""I am No Man."" But she didn't say it-- she did it. I liked that the group's sniper doesn't actually snipe. It's realistic that soldiers sometimes don't actually shoot their weapons in battle. Of course that provided an excuse for Wonder Woman to save the day, but that could have been achieved without that touch of realism. HumorThe script didn't go overboard with the humor, but there was enough there to relieve tension in what was otherwise more of a war movie than a superhero film audience might expect. Yes, there is a penis joke, but hey, Shakespeare did penis jokes, too, right? I liked that the sword-in-the-dress scene, which I knew about from Facebook friends sharing ""got your back"" pics, turned out to be a moment of humor instead of a serious fight scene, because the actual fight scene that happened later was way better than it would have been in a room full of noncombatants. Stranger in a Strange LandThis movie did the fish-out-of-water thing way better than the first Thor movie did. In part that was because Diana didn't know things, like whether men slept, that were really basic things about our world but which she genuinely had a good story reason not to know. There was the inevitable ""getting local clothes"" scene, but it wasn't overplayed. The villainAt first, when the backstory of Ares was explained by the Amazons, it seemed like Ares was going to be the sort of evil villain that does evil just for the sake of evil. Of course a superhero story needs a supervillain, and given that Diana is the daughter of Zeus (which I already knew before they made this movie, but which Diana herself doesn't know until late in the movie) of course no mere human villain could be much of an obstacle to her. In the actual Greek mythology, a human/ god offspring is a demigod, and like Hercules, is expected to be better than any human being. The same goes for the story logic here. So of course only another god could be much of a challenge to her. So I saw story logic, rather than the excessive influence of Christian dualism, in turning Ares into some kind of Satan in this movie. I was prepared to accept that for the sake of the story, which is, after all, fiction. But oh, they did so much more with him by the end.Ares turned out to be completely different than Diana had thought. Not only was he a different person, with a different name and body, than she had thought, but his motivation turned out to be exactly the same as her own: to eliminate evil by killing it. Diana went to find Ares to kill him because she thought he was evil and responsible for war and suffering, and Ares was trying to kill humankind because he thought humans were evil and responsible for war and suffering. Diana and Ares were alike, two of a kind, in a way that went far beyond being brother and sister gods. Ares only appeared to be evil if one first centers humanity and bases moral judgments off of what benefits or harms humankind. It turned out, this was not a story of dualism at all, not a story of an evil being fighting a good being, but a story of two beings that share the same motivation and dedication to eradicating evil, but differ only on their opinion of mankind. This complicated view of how one defines evil was a truly wonderful thing to find in a superhero movie. The hero's character arcDiana starts out as a young idealist and enthusiast of the fighting arts from a warrior culture that believes in love in the abstract, toward humanity. Along the way she loses her naivety and gains romantic, attached love. She develops as a warrior and hero the more she loses her fascination with fighting for its own sake and gives her attention to saving others, especially those she loves. That is a standard journey of maturity for a hero, and it barely references her gender except in the details. The bones of the story could have been told about any superhero; the story was fleshed out in such a way that Wonder Woman was both truly a wonder and most definitely a woman, and those two things did not conflict with each other.","4 out of 14 found this helpful.

What I do wish to say is all the actors did a splendid job in telling the story. The way it was written and presented is top notch! For me DC had been lacking luster for awhile. I did enjoy The Dark Knight in 2008 with Heath Ledger in probably his finest performance of all time. And I must now add Gal Gadot to that list of performances that left me cheering for more! I also enjoyed Batman Vs.Superman but mainly due to Ben Affleck. He I could see worked hard to make that movie.And now I see Wonder Woman as a equal super hero! Can we have a Wonder Woman 2 please!?A very classy movie! A superb cast! And a huge bravo for DC. We grew up with your comic's! And I for one wish to thank you for making us believe once again!

It also gave light on the subject of being the first female lead superhero film (Gal Gadot) and it overthrew of expectations I had. This universe started with a dark and grimy feel to all films to come out of it.

"9","/10","Best superhero movie ever? No. But third place is not bad at all...","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3721512/?ref_=tt_urv","regula1","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur37920803/?ref_=tt_urv","1 June 2017","If we were to rank all of the modern superhero movies, and by that I mean starting with 2000's X-Men, which was the first true modern superhero movie after the glory days of Tim Burton's Batman and Christopher Reeve's Superman, number one would probably have to be The Dark Knight, followed closely by Captain America: The Winter Soldier.Wonder Woman would be third on that list, and since we live in an age overflowing with superhero films, third place is nothing to be ashamed of.This film is, in a word, epic. Not in the same way as a film like Lord of the Rings is epic, with large scope and breathtaking battle scenes. Rather, its epic feel comes from the great performances and sheer raw emotion Gal Gadot conveys as the titular heroine Diana Prince aka Wonder Woman.The film takes place as a flashback, beginning with Diana being sent a photo sometime after the events of Batman v. Superman from Bruce Wayne, a photo teased in that previous film, and brings us to Diana's childhood on the island of the Amazons, guardians of the world tasked with one day defeating Ares, the god of war, should he ever return.One day, Diana sees a plane crash off the shores of her island. The pilot, Steve Trevor, played excellently by Chris Pine, informs Diana of the war going on in Europe, the War to End All Wars aka World War I.She then embarks on her quest to fulfill her people's mission, for she believes Ares has returned and is at the heart of this war, and if she defeats him, the war will end. Thus begins her transformation into the heroine that would be known as Wonder Woman.This film had a lot riding on it, mainly because the DC Extended Universe has had to play catch-up with the Marvel Cinematic Universe for the past four years, with Marvel having a five year head start (Iron Man came out in 2008, whereas Man of Steel, the DCEU's first film, came out in 2013).Therefore, it's all the more impressive that a cinematic universe still in its infancy, and after the relative disappointments of Batman v. Superman and Suicide Squad, can produce such a strong origin story of a superhero that many may not know too much about.Where this movie shines is the chemistry between Gadot and Pine, and the levity that comes from misunderstandings, a common comedic trope but it feels so genuine between these two that it feels fresh.Also, props to Hans Zimmer, who, while not composing the score for this film, made the unofficial Wonder Woman theme (refer to ""Is She With You?"" from the Batman v. Superman soundtrack). Whenever it plays in this film, it sends chills down my spine because that means something bad-ass is going to go down. Way to go!Where this movie may falter is in the inevitable comparisons. There's no getting around the fact that this film, for all of its great qualities, bears much resemblance to Captain America: The First Avenger, due to its period setting origin story, among other things.Nevertheless, this film is a testament to what the DCEU can be, and I can only hope that Justice League lives up the the very, VERY high standard Wonder Woman has now set.","4 out of 15 found this helpful.

Superhero movies now-a-days are the thing to be in. Everybody loves them, and they earn well. That said I think they are becoming increasingly predictive and mind-numbing boring. I know mine is not the popular opinion out there but this movie enters my long list of over hyped superhero movies.Wonder Woman starts of with us being introduced to the world of Amazons and their home Themyscira. I have to say I was pretty thrilled till the first half hour. But that is when the movie starts to go down. The story moves at a snail's pace with some humor in the form of Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) and his secretary. Diana's introduction to the human world makes up for some funny moments which after a point seem forced. Although I do give credit to Patty Jenkins for capturing the naivety of Diana perfectly. The second act sees Diana and Steve going to the front which seems to take forever. In between they pick up three mercenaries who apart from providing some comedic relief don't do much. The third act gives us some much awaited action sequences which I must say have been very well done. Although, the final showdown, just like the previous DC movies comes as a letdown considering the preceding action sequences. Also, the ending king of ruined the effect of the movie for me (you have to see it to know).In all, Wonder Woman delivers on a lot of fronts. Action sequences have been well choreographed, acting was decent (except some cringe-worthy moments from Gal Gadot), and the comedic tone was also there. But the long running time makes the movie boring and thinking back I can surely say that some scenes shouldn't have been there. The movie does provide some powerful moments towards the end, but by then you are wondering if this was worth all that came before. Also, the ending... aaaarghhhhh. I guess too many superhero movies have done what Wonder Woman tried to do, thus nothing really stands out. Except, obviously the fact that this is the first female superhero feature film.","7 out of 16 found this helpful.

For years, DC fans have asked for a superhero movie to push DC up a level. And Wonder Woman did it. Patty Jenkins did it. Gat Gadot did it. Women did it. It's really hard not to gloat especially when for years the narrative was that women aren't into action movies or superhero movies. That women can't direct them and a woman as a lead can't appeal to the audience.Well, how about that?Coming out of the cinema, and barely two hours after the Wonder Woman premiere, I can barely find the words to describe the experience. Because that's what it was. Last year I was in awe to see Batman and Superman on the same screen. I didn't care for the quality of the movie or the fighting that didn't happen between them; I'm a fan who's easily pleased and just seeing them on the screen together was enough. Martha ridiculousness put aside. But the moment Wonder Woman appeared out of nowhere in the middle, shield on one arm and sword on the other, I was sold. Diana became a bright spot in this dark and gloomy universe to look forward to and boy did she deliver.No matter how many times I'd seen the trailer nothing could possible prepare me for the places this movie would take me.Origin story? Check. Coming of age story? Check. Badass action scenes? Check. Unbelievable character growth? Check. Humor? Check check check check. Love story? Check. WW1? Check. Mythology? Check.It checks all the freaking boxes. Wonder Woman is a movie DC fans can be proud of and actually scream it from the rooftops, DC DID THAT! The movie starts as an origin story of Diana, I didn't expect there to be so much of her background, yes for future movies the character had to be properly set but this went deep and it felt amazing to be in their world and see the Amazons training and fight, they were majestic, so beautiful and out of this world ‚Äì literally. And it moves to a coming of age story as Diana realizes her powers are unlike her fellow Amazons. Enter Steve Trevor, a spy who crushes on her island.As Diana arrives in London ready to stop the war that will end all wars, WW1 becomes the center of the story. It did remind me a lot of Captain America: The First Avenger, and that's a huge compliment. WW allows the character's arc to slowly build up and especially during the second act, Diana takes a huge step as Wonder Woman and reveals her true identity, walking into No Man's Land.Apart from the color that was greatly lacking in the previous DC movies, color matters people use it, WW managed to give each character the amount of screen time required to make me care for them. Diana wasn't just WW, kicking asses and being a God among people. Steve wasn't just her romantic partner, he brought a lot to this movie, and the sidekicks each brought something small that in the third act mattered a lot.If I had to nitpick and say something negative, that would be the villain, sure by now I'm used to villains being a little over the top and so dramatic.. could it have been better? Sure. Did that make the movie less wonderful than it was? No. Is it re-watchable as a standalone superhero movie that covers multiple genres? Yes!With a run time of 2h 21min and even with my OCD, there's not a minute to spare on this one, every second was captivating, every scene valuable, every character irreplaceable. Kudos to Patty Jenkins for finally bringing us a memorable DC movie, kudos to the cast for delivering top- notch performances. There's a scene where Queen Hippolyta stays to Diana, be careful in the world of men, Diana, they do not deserve you. And we truly do not.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

Wow. Second impression? Wow.This is what Man of Steel should have been. Wonder Woman is a better Superman movie than the one we got. It has heart, it has style, it has hope, it has love, it has comedy, it has action. Patti Jenkins did a fantastic job directing this movie. This is not a great female superhero film. It's not a great superhero film. It is a great film.Gal Gadot plays a tremendous Diana Prince. Lilly Aspell plays an adorable young Diana. I feel like she nailed it as well. Not only was she very cute, but she showed a lot of the same determination that Diana shows. The other Amazons were also really good. Patti made a good choice having all the extras be real life athletes and such play the parts. Every single one of them look like they could kick your ass.I feel Steve's introduction was handled well, and the interaction between him and her was perfect. Like the film itself, it had heart, style, laughter, and love. Not that the it made a big deal about them loving each other. It was done very organically in my opinion. You could see and feel the connection growing between the two of them, but it never felt that it was over done.I absolutely loved Lucy Davis as Etta. This is another good quality on display here. It's still done in a ""realistic"" sort of way. Etta is still a strong woman, but she is still a woman of her time. She's not weak at all, in fact she is quite strong. But she doesn't suddenly become a hero just because she's a woman. She's stronger than you might expect, but not in an exaggerated way. Instead she's also quite human. Cute and funny, yes, but still a woman from that era.Which brings me to another point. I'll admit I had some doubts about how awesome this would be. The hype from some of the more hard-core feminists made me worry that it was going to be a typical ""strong woman"" movie. The ones where the women can do everything and the men are just bumbling idiots (to be fair, this does happen the other way around, and it's irritating then too). But Patti didn't do that.It is a female led superhero movie, but it doesn't feel like it was directed that way. Instead Patti just focused on making a good movie. Yes, the star is female, Yes, the director is female. And yes, there are quite a few powerful women, but the kicker is that it wasn't the goal. It wasn't even really the heart of the movie. It doesn't feel like there's any ""agenda"". It's just a very well done movie.Diana is very clearly the star (as she should be) and doesn't take a back seat to Steve at all. However, he is definitely not worthless. He's still a very competent soldier and Diana would have run into serious problems if she had tried to go solo. Which makes sense, she is unfamiliar with our world. She has spent her entire life on Themyscira and was clearly naive about our world.Which humanized her. She was clearly a goddess and a powerful being, but unlike Man of Steel, she was shown to have heart and was someone you could relate to. Or as Patti put it, she's a warrior and a goddess, but she's still a woman. And there's nothing wrong with that! I've known similar women in my life. Women who seem about as girly as a pile of mud, but offer them flowers or something pretty and they get all giddy. Not that Diana gets giddy, but she shows clear signs of still being a woman. Despite the fact that she could kill just about anyone. Back to the movie itself.I also feel that it is very well paced. There's action before it ever gets boring. There's well placed and appropriate dialogue. There's a variety of emotions and scenery. This film very much stands out from the rest of the DCEU. The other films so far have seemed rather dark and dreary, this film has hope. There are dark and dreary parts, but they are interspersed with light and beauty. It has balance, something lacking in the rest of the DCEU offerings.OK, so that's a partial list of my praises for the movie (Did I mention it's awesome?). Now on to the critiques.Most of them are minor and are basically common movie complaints. The first battle scene was pretty cool, but I felt the Amazonians came across as a bit stupid. Which they wouldn't be. Couple of other small things like that here and there, but nothing particularly memorable.Except for the ending. The final fight. It had some cool parts and it was well choreographed, but it didn't feel like it belonged in this movie. It went from Patti's movie to Synder's movie. It's possible Snyder wasn't involved at all in the final fight sequence, but it certainly felt like he was. Compared to the rest of the movie this was mostly lackluster and rather typical. I'm not saying it was horrible, it just isn't nearly as good as the rest of the film.Overall I easily give this a 9/10. It's good enough that I watched it twice and thoroughly enjoyed it both times.People who should watch this movie.People who like comic book movies and/or superheroes People who like strong female heroes People who like movies set in a war zone People who like movies with great dialogue ¬Ö People who like movies.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

""Wonder Woman"" was not perfect, so few movies made today are. I can agree with the 1 star rating naysayers on a point or two as it indeed needed a little more action, the CGI is pretty obvious at times and it did contain a bit of the obligatory Hollywood commentary on the current state of modern society. Having said that, none of the above made this movie unwatchable. In fact, it was quite good.However, the poster who claimed Gil Gadot is less attractive than Lynda Carter has lost his mind, or at the very least, his eye sight. Lynda Carter was/is a beautiful actress, but she can't polish Gadot's magic wrist bands. The Israeli actress is a wonder to look at and her acting in ""Wonder Woman"" was good enough. Good flick.

In opposition to the comment in the Frequently Asked Questions section, I believe that the death of Ludendorff indicates that, in the Wonder Woman universe, World War II might have been averted. Ludendorff invented the ""stab in the back"" myth that the German army was not defeated on the field of battle, and that the surrender of Germany was due to the betrayal of the army by civilians on the home front, especially by Jews. This idea was picked up by Nationalists, e.g., Hitler. Without the stab in the back myth, perhaps Hitler would never have been able to seize power, and therefore, no WWII.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I don't think Gal Gadot is the best actress in the world but she did fine there were a few moments where I thought that it didn't completely sell, but it did not take away from my experience in the movie. Chris Pine was great in this movie and I wish he played a more dominant role in the DCEU like a Hal Jordan or an Oliver Queen. Wonder Womans theme was great like it was BvS. The cinematography in this movie was actually really good and the colors palate was different and fresh compared to the typical DC movie. A lot of the issues I have with Wonder Woman are spoilers, but also very minor. Overall this movie is a solid 8.2/10. If you liked Captain America: The First Avenger I think you'll definitely enjoy this movie and if you didn't you may enjoy bits and pieces of the movie. This movie definitely makes me excited to see Justice League this fall.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I'm so glad we finally have a fantastic role model and a strong, fearless female superhero for little girls to look up to. Wonder Woman is the ultimate goddess heroine that we have all been waiting for.As for the movie, I was pleasantly surprised by the clever way she was introduced to humanity via immersion in the First World War. It's actually brilliant to see her in the trenches and on the battlefields. The visuals and juxtapositions are second to none. The storyline is genius and I loved every minute. I was sad when it ended and I really hope there's a sequel. It was not completely perfect - Chris Pine was underwhelming, as were our two villains. But the Amazons and Gal Gadot were perfection. I just wish we had seen more of the Amazons throughout the film.I honestly can't understand how anyone would think this movie is less than wonderful. The negative reviews must be from Marvel bots or man babies who hate women. It's literally the only explanation for hating this movie.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Certainly better than several other super hero movies that have come out in the past few years. I particularly liked the first part on the island where the amazons shine. Young Diana is funny (Hello Mother! How are you today?"" is my favourite quote of the movie) and the battle on the beach is really good. Antiope was the best character with Steve Trevor, I'm really sorry they both died. It was unnecessary certainly in her case, in his case he had to die as an act of human redemption.As for other comments I agree that she is not the icon of independence and self determination that she usually is. And Steve Trevor drives the plot she follows. And she only finds her powers as result of the loss of her lover. Typically feminine. Life always spins around a man.Many people who complain about the similarities with captain America seem to forget that they were born in the same year, 1941, during World War II. They unavoidably have some similarities.People who complain about her destroying the tower when she jumps in I'm afraid never watched a DC cartoon in their lives or even the previous movies in which common people are tired of these super heroes destroying buildings and buldozing cities in their fights. Superhero movies don't have to be credible that way. As a matter of fact one of the positive things of this movie is that they kept her strength and also her capacity of taking a good beating as well as destroying buildings when she jumps into them.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

I knew that it was getting high marks from pretty much everyone, but I still was not convinced. When I walked out of theater I was shocked at how good it really was. Here's what I loved about the movie:1.) The humor was on point. I can't say how many times I busted up laughing the first time I watched it and the humor still gets me laughing even after seeing it four times. Everyone plays off each other perfectly for optimal laughs and very few jokes fell flat for me. 2.) Everyone does a great job acting. Gal Gadot pulls off a great naive, young Wonder Woman who is fascinated by literally everything for the first half of the movie. Her emotional transitions are pulled off well throughout the whole movie as well. Her role as Wonder Woman is one of the best superhero characters in my opinion. Chris Pine also does an awesome job portraying a WWI soldier who doesn't really know how to handle this whole Wonder Woman thing. In this movie, I truly got behind the characters.3). The action is interesting and a lot of fun. None of the action scenes got too long and all of them were enjoyable to watch.4.) I liked the story. It's not often that we get a movie based in WWI. Everything flowed well and the villains were convincing. I actually cared about the plot because it was interesting and engaging. I ended up seeing Wonder Woman twice in theater and now I own it on Blu Ray. It was one of my favorite movies of 2017. I strongly recommend it!","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's just a tricky concept I guess. So far, only the X: First Class and 
X-Men: Days of Future Past has really impressed me... and now, Wonder Woman!Quick story recap, our hero Diana is raised on an isolated Amazon island, gets trained and discovers she has unusual amounts of powers. Next, a plane crashes through the islands force field carrying a pilot escaping from the Germans during WWI. This becomes the wake up call for Diana to realize war is still a thing outside of her protected paradise, and she joins the pilot to go out into the world for the first time to Fix it - not as simple as her idealized mind would have it.First of all, if you don't like historical revisionism this (nor above mentioned superhero titles) might not be your thing. But if you acknowledge it's all fantasy and a certain amount of artistic liberty can be allowed in this area if done right, then you shouldn't have a problem.In the end success or failure for me in any movie (or book, comic etc) is all about the characters. You can watch a movie with pretty much no story if the characters are interesting and compelling, but no matter how great a story, it won't it matter if the characters don't capture you in the slightest. Be it love or distain, they have to make you feel something.
Here you gotta hand it to Gal Gadot playing Diana. Her Wonder Woman is absolutely captivating. You will not be able to take your eyes of her for a minute, and I don't mean her looks (though stunning).
Her combination av strength, na√Øvet√© and unintentional humor is not only on spot, it feels completely novel but still manages to be 100% believable, which is vigorously refreshing. Gadot might not have much acting experience but you wouldn't believe it as she simply glows in this.
Chris Pine also makes for a compelling sidekick as Steve, completely inferior in physical power, but superior in his experience of the ""modern"" world. Introducing the completely inexperienced Diana to it let's him take the lead to a certain amount, creating a nice power balance and sets up for some well rounded humour.
And speaking of the humor thank GOD for the lack of slapsticks! The jokes are never in your face and manages to feel fresh and original for a change.It's not a perfect movie; which drags it down from a (superhero movie) 10. The villain/villains was miscast to me and not super interesting (The Germans all being the bad guys is So Done, and seeing as the scene at least was WWI there was an opportunity to offer a bit more grayscale but alas, no...) , although the fighting scenes were beautifully choreographed I'm afraid the budget does not hold up for the CGI to age very well etc... 
But the novelty and charm of the characters, the daring and original message of the film, and the pure awesomeness of some kick-ass fight scenes more than make up for it.And finally, can we please let go of the Female Superhero thing a bit? Sure I'm as happy as anyone there's a bit more balance in the genre but for it to dominate the reviews this much is doing the movie a disservice. Female, Male, Alien, AI robot, who cares as long as it's an interesting and well played character.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I am so glad I can say this is good, because it could very easily failed horribly but thanks to the confidence of the director (Patty Jenkins) and the performance of Gal Gadot, which is very similar to Christopher Reeves in the original Superman, make this a superb movie. And unlike other DC movies there's COLOUR, by God there is colour in this movie and its glorious- Themyscira looks almost mythical in appearance. They also don't shy away from the horror of war, not going full blown war movie but enough to feel the real. 
The acting is also on point with a lot of subtle actions which just adds to the performances, and the film has a lot of slow moments to build up the characters, it's not all action. But where WW falls is the ending, it's like every other DC movie a mass of CGI at night which is really disappointing as it was great up to then and saying that there's still good stuff happening but would be great if I can see the entirety of it. The other issue is the villian like all other Superhero movies are unremarkable- Aries would be better as a concept rather than an actual thing. Nonetheless Wonder Women is a fantastic movie which display a strong female character that transcends gender and is simply a strong likeable character. And unlike Ghostbusters 2016, WW doesn't treat men as idiots or arseholes- this is a movie for both men and women and is an enjoyable out-of-world story with some fantastic action sequences told with a great sense of earnest. I give Wonder Women a B+","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It certainly has a livelier and less somber tone than 'Man of Steel' and 'Batman Vs Superman', and works better as an introduction to the character than either of those films. Most of this is down to Gadot, who plays Diana with innocence, as well as integrity and passion. Also, doesn't hurt that she's extremely beautiful. The film does a good job of introducing the Amazons and how their island-home, Themyscira, is hidden from the world.Diana's mum, Queen Hippolyta (Nielsen) has kept her sheltered for her whole life (not certain if the Amazons are immortal, or not...), but this changes when World War I finds them, via Captain Trevor (Pine). Then, Diana's off to the real world to help mankind in their battle against Ares, God of War (a substitute for the Central Powers in WWI). There's plenty of funny moments as Diana is introduced to London in the early 20th century and especially with Trevor, since she's never met a male before. We quickly meet Trevor's rag-tag team and suddenly we're off to Belgium where the action begins and we get to see Wonder Woman in full flight/fight.Ludendorff (Huston) is good as the evil German general, but there's a few similarities with 'Captain America: The First Avenger', as he is basically a ""Red Skull""-substitute, has an offsider who develops weapons of mass destruction, gets super-strength, and then has to fight someone super-strong wearing red and blue. The main difference is that Wonder Woman' is set WWI, but both comic book characters were created in 1941 during WWII. Still, it doesn't really detract for the film, with plenty of great hand-to-hand combat, as well as full-on war scenes. Pretty satisfying conclusion, with Diana's purpose, humour, powers and morals all being set-up nicely for 'Justice League', but works well as a standalone film.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Chris Pine does an excellent job, but every other scene hurts the soul. The story is simply uninteresting. You never care about any of the characters. Their caricature of WWII is pathetic. Every story element, turn is a comic book loosely based on reality scene, which would be fine IF the film was more like a comic book movie, but it's not. It's played entirely literal.

It's basic martial arts fighting with a little more flexibility in the joints. It's very cool.The movie works hard to create moments that look to come out of a comic book, like a strikingly iconic moment of WW walking towards the camera or, in the film's best scene, her crouched behind her shield against a bullet barrage.While some superhero movies are just noisy action sequences strung together by a skeleton plot and cartoon characters (such as the overrated Avengers), Wonder Woman takes its story seriously, with WW's idealism butting up against humanity's awfulness.For a movie set in WWI there isn't really that much period flavor. There is, however, a terrific sense of WW's otherness in a world where women are not taken seriously.Overall one of the better superhero movies, and well worth watching.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The final proof was at the Comiccon signing line, where a very young fan teared up when she met Gal Gadot. That's how awesome this movie is -- it leaves that kind of impression on even the youngest of us. Also, Gal's response was what I'd always imagined how the comics WW would respond to her. This was REAL.Negative Fanboys, obscene SJWs and the rest of the haters can go jump into a black hole -- the Wonder Woman film conquered everything that's come before it, and is the new gold standard all others should be measured by.","4 out of 18 found this helpful.

On a more positive note, because there were so many trailers featuring Taron Egerton, Ansel Elgort, and Dane DeHaan, I finally realized they are actually three different dudes who get asked to be in movies.Origin stories usually suck. At least this time we don't have to watch Uncle Ben get murdered again. We start on a hidden island that is hidden so well that you can't find it unless you fly into it or sail to it. Men are absent, until Chris Pine shows up, who claims to be ""above average"" through some very, very below average dialogue. This Wonder Woman movie is different, because it's set in WWI, and we get to fight the Germans! Red Skull and Captain America had to wait through the 1930s before taking their turn. Logan was splitting skulls way back in the Civil War, I believe. Are we going to get an Aquaman movie set during one of the Opium Wars, I hope, I hope!Evil, we know, is nothing by itself. It has to co-opt people and make them do bad things. And if evil can get another piece of evil to join it, say like Star Lord's dad or Darth Vader tried to do, there's no telling how bad bad can get. Good thing there's good people in the world, heroes and gods, to keep us from killing ourselves too much.The plot meanders and heavily paws at noble ideals of love, peace, and human failure. Humans don't deserve Amazonian protection, nor do they deserve movies like Wonder Woman. Ares wants war forever, and Hollywood wants us to eat these garbage bites forever. Why are all the DC movies so dark, so stormy, so serious?Oh, we get some light-hearted clothes shopping in post-Victorian London. It's awful funny watching an Amazon shop for dresses. Women don't need men for pleasure, but anyone with a vibrator could tell you that.It's good to see Chris Pine, Chris Pratt, and Chris Evans (the Chris Syndicate) getting so much work these days.","9 out of 23 found this helpful.

It was a little slow, but overall it set up how wonder woman grew up and go outside the world and kill god of war.Diana was raised on the hidden island of Themyscira, home to the Amazon race of warrior women created by the gods of Mount Olympus to protect humankind. In the distant past, Ares, the god of war, slew all his fellow gods, but his father, Zeus, struck him down. Before succumbing to his injuries, Zeus left the Amazons a weapon capable of killing his renegade son: the ""Godkiller"", presented as a ceremonial sword. Queen Hippolyta, Diana's mother, believes that Ares will never return and forbids Diana from training as a warrior, but Diana and her aunt General Antiope defy the queen and begin training in secret. When the two are discovered by Hippolyta, Antiope convinces her sister to allow Diana's training.As a young woman in 1918, Diana rescues American pilot Captain Steve Trevor after his plane crashes off Themyscira's coast. The island is soon invaded by the landing party of a German cruiser pursuing Steve. The Amazons engage and kill all of the German sailors, but Antiope sacrifices herself to save Diana by intercepting a bullet meant for her. Interrogated with the Lasso of Hestia, Steve reveals that ""The War to End All Wars"" is raging in the outside world, and that he is an Allied spy. He has stolen a notebook with valuable information from the Spanish chief chemist Isabel Maru, who is attempting to engineer a deadlier form of mustard gas under the orders of General Erich Ludendorff, from a weapons facility in the Ottoman Empire. Believing Ares is responsible for the war, Diana arms herself with the sword and leaves Themyscira with Steve to find and destroy Ares.Diana translates Maru's notes and reveals that the Germans plan to release the deadly gas at the warfront. Although forbidden by his commanders to act, Steve, with secret funding from Sir Patrick, recruits spy Sameer, marksman Charlie, and smuggler Chief to help prevent the gas from being released. When the team reaches the Western Front in Belgium, they are halted by the enemy lines, but Diana pushes alone through no man's land and rallies the Allied forces behind her to liberate the village of Veld. The team briefly celebrates and takes the group photograph from the beginning of the film. That night, Diana and Steve become intimate and share a kiss.The team learns a gala will be held at the nearby German High Command. Steve and Diana each infiltrate the party, he intending to locate the gas and destroy it, she intending to kill Ludendorff, believing he is Ares and that killing him will end the war. Steve stops her to avoid destroy his plan. Ludendorff unleashes the gas on Veld, killing its inhabitants. Diana blames Steve for intervening and pursues Ludendorff to a base where the gas is being loaded into a bomber aircraft bound for London. Diana fights and kills Ludendorff but is confused when his death does not stop the war.Sir Patrick appears, revealing himself as Ares and tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans The evil ideas and evil inspirations which is ultimately their decision to cause violence as they are inherently corrupt. He destroys the ceremonial sword, revealing Diana is the true ""Godkiller"" as she is Zeus' daughter, then tries to persuade her to help him destroy humankind to restore paradise on Earth. While the two battles and the rest of Steve's team destroy Maru's laboratory, Steve pilots the bomber carrying the gas to a safe altitude and detonates it, sacrificing himself in the process. Ares attempts to harness Diana's rage and grief at Steve's death by convincing her to kill Maru, but her memories of Steve cause her to decide that humans have good within them.

In fact, I thought this movie was so good that I made an IMDb account just for the sole purpose of writing the review. I'm not sure if it is because I entered the theater with no expectations of a good movie based on DC's track record of ruining good classics, but this movie if anything gave Wonder Woman the name it deserved in this generation. Not to be an annoying feminist, but the superhero world of DC (and a little bit of marvel) lacks an amazing stand-out woman superhero like Wonder Woman who sets an ideal example for girls of all ages that ya don't need no man to be a powerful ""af"" God whipping bullet proof woman. Besides the fact that I left the theater feeling incredibly powerful, the humor in this movie was so tasteful, every sexual gag from Chris Pine to Gal Gadot was so freaking hilarious to me. All in all, from the feminism, to the humor, to the action scenes, Wonder Woman was excellently executed in EVERY SINGLE WAY.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

And attention, I mean those who have the ability, competence (knowledge, skills) to issue judgments Value in this regard! ""Wonder Woman"" offers the world in the grip of the innocent soul of its own age, of course, but of course it does not justify the angry attacks that seek to disqualify it without the right to appeal from valuable artistic creations. It must be read among the rows / cadres making the concessions necessary for the younger age, as I was saying. Whatever might be said, the way in which ... the film treats the eternal theme of the struggle between good and evil still retains it in the gallery of valuable artistic creations. We are not talking about Oscar awards, masterpieces ... but from here to to throw it in the garbage (""Wonder Woman"") is a long way ... An interesting aspect - in a negative role is also a very beautiful woman physically, but ugly of her evil choice. There is a lot to say, but I would only stop on one aspect. Attacking ""Wonder Woman"" too serious advocates of the rigors of artistic creation move away from subtle truth. Let us now think about Romania, although we can offer many other examples. Are we intrigued by the way the film shows the physical strength of the heroine (exponent) Diana, of the female principle in general? Is it a young artistic representation? If so, let's say that Diana's amazing physical powers are small childhood in addition to the efforts and achievements they have done for the Romanian nation (in a context of hell) Queen Maria or Ecaterina Teodoroiu ... And not only They obviously. ""Wonder Woman"" is a film that tells the younger age a fundamental truth: love is true to the extent that it is unconditional, and the ultimate test is the acceptance of personal sacrifice when needed.","3 out of 13 found this helpful.

For all the people who reviewed this movie as bad, let me explain. The plot was simple clean and done correctly. Not too complex. Many reviews I heard said it's basically the same thing as Captain America. Well that's just too bad because this movie stayed true to the comics. Is it bad for a movie to be true to the comics. Of course not. Some people never read the comics and just judge the movie without even reading the damn comics. They only judge by watching the movies both Wonder Woman and Captain America. Saying oh it's too similar. Also, another issue saying it completely defies logic well.. what do you know.. this movie is listed science ""FICTION"" and FANTASY. So of course some things are not realistic and some are CGI cause something like this movie would really not happen in reality. Some people thought the movie was boring and barely action. Well its an origin story, its going to tell you how Diana became Wonder Woman, with these small parts that help define the character, like the scene when Steve shows her to dance. Many others thought it didn't show how Diana actually became Wonder Woman.. and I'm like bish are you blind? It basically shows how in this movie.. like are you serious? And also its not like a feminist movie. It was actually a very equal movie. Its like a Ghostbusters (2016) reminding me that I'm an awful human being cause I'm a man. Overall, this movie was fantastic. I recommend on watching it if you love the comics.","3 out of 14 found this helpful.

First is that out of all the super hero(Marvel/DC) movies that have come out in the past 5 years, it has had one of the most understandable plots as far as the realistic aspect of the film gives. Although the Amazonian's are not a real culture and their culture is superficial, as are most superhero films, she follows her destiny to help the human race as well as facing her problems that are set out for her by finding Aries and killing him to bring balance to everything, including her people. Overall it inspires you to believe in Wonder Woman as a protagonist and it gives you hope to what she will accomplish in the future.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

It has good characters, a focused story line and good pacing.

Instead it focuses only on Wonder Woman and her story.This movie takes place during the first world war and it shows some of the horrific things from the war. So it is pretty dark at some moments. But at the same time it's not too dark. Chris Pine's character delivers a lot of great banter and jokes.All in all it's great. It flows very well and it really explores Wonder Woman as a character. I definitely recommend this one.8/10","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Gal Gadot is perfect for the role, it was really refreshing that DC went with a little known new face rather than an established actress. She commands the screen, is likable, beautiful, heroic, human, and believably genuine in her performance.I am a big fan of comicbook movies, my favorites include the original Guardians of the Galaxy, the first Iron Man, the Avengers, and Hellboy, and for an old classic, Superman II with Christopher Reeve. I think what makes for a successful comicbook movie is the ability to make the protagonists relatable to the audience despite their amazing powers, to have a touch of humor mixed in with the amazing spectacular cinematic action sequences where if you took a snapshot of it, it could easily be a frame from an artful comicbook page. Wonderwoman I think is one of the few DC movies that captures all of these qualities.In most of the Batman movies, and in each of the newer Superman movies, I find that I really don't care about the protagonist. The heroes seem unrelatable, powerful but not very likable or heroic. In most of the DC films, it's really hard to understand what the hero is doing, what their motivations are, Batman and Superman seem like abstract caricatures rather than real people... Wonderwoman is the first DC movie that I think has heart and really feels ""heroic"" in the DC cinematic universe. I wish every DC movie was this good.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

As a kid I fell in love with Linda Carter as Wonder Woman on the small screen. I got to watch this movie with my son for the second time and of all the DC movies this one stands out on his own. Patty Jenkins was at the helm with this one and her visual direction gave this visually stunning flick a fighting chance. The acting was subpar but the storyline was compelling putting mythical gods on the map. Chris Pine was not a convincing British spy without an accent which gave the movie one less star. Robin Wright portrayed Gadot's aunt who taught her everything to be the superhero that she became. The story brings Wonder Woman out of the Amazon during WWI to help protect those that can't protect themselves. I also found the computer fighting sequences to be less stunning and not very appealing but knowing that Gadot was pregnant during filming I would say it did it's job. I would recommend this one it was good to watch again.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I grew up reading Wonder Woman comics and watching animated media related to Wonder Woman and I was so excited to hear a live-action film was taking place.But my hopes were destroyed when Gal Gadot was cast. She doesn't remotely look like the iconic Diana we know and love and I didn't know who she was at all. Only after googling I found out she was a menial character in Fast and Furious and did movies that weren't box office hits. But her acting was horrible, she was wooden, lifeless and couldn't deliver dialogue or heroics. She was terribly miscast and someone competent who can act and looks like Diana should've been cast.Whilst Gal Gadot terribly disappointed in her acting, Patty Jenkins equally disappointed in the movie itself. I struggled to get myself interested and nearly half the cinema lost the will to live. The movie was so boring, people were sleeping. There was a slow and bland progression throughout the movie. The action and dialogue were so tasteless that I felt I was watching a watered down fan film done by inexperienced people who never made a film before. Whilst Chris Pine and David Thewlis played their part well, Gal Gadot's misery cannot be ignored. It is evident Patty hasn't read any comics as she clearly didn't understand the character. Heavily overrated film!The music was decent and the CGI was below average. This abysmal film made me lose hope in any future Patty or Gal films and in any DCEU Wonder Woman sequels. If it were up to me, I wouldn't have cast Gal Gadot nor hire Patty Jenkins to run the film.","8 out of 20 found this helpful.

I have to say D.C. finally wins Marvel. Gal Gadot acts Wonder Woman successfully, there is no doubt that she is born for this character, very gorgeous, beautiful¬Ö can't use any words to describe her. however, are there any people agree that Chris Pine carries this movie? I think he probably is the best Steve ever in DC history (Just my opinion). This movie follows the theme of the Wonder Woman, Justice, Love, and Feminist, it gives me a deep impression that women also can do what men do. Comparing to the Batman vs Superman, this movie is slow which gives people a willingness to continue to watch and a comfortable feeling. Moreover, the theme song of the Wonder Woman is very memorable. This is the best D.C. Movie since after The Dark Knight. Very impressed and I am very look forward the next one.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

I really expected the film to fail until the first reviews came in. And while it is not a perfect film, its a very good superhero drama with many great elements. Putting Patty Jenkins on the director chair was a brave and inspired choice and it paid off. She did a fantastic job creating the world around this iconic character. And not only when it comes to story telling Jenkins succeeded, also the action scenes were perfectly choreographed. Another reason why the film works so well is leading actress Gal Gadot who was already the best thing in Batman Vs. Superman and now again convinces with her charismatic performance that has a lot of depth to it. Chris Pine was also decent enough and an ideal choice for that role. I had loved to see more of the amazon mythology especially with Robin Wright's great character but the World War I setting also gave the film a good touch. And they did the implementation better than Marvel did with the first Captain America. The score was great, the cinematography and editing wonderful. I could have done with less slow motion moments but in general this is for DC to go the right direction with.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's not perfect, but it's still an important film. A must watch!I can't even deal with all the superhero movies coming out these days. Film after film with generic white males dressed in tights starts to get boring and unappealing. Enter Wonder Woman -- Gal Gadot is resplendent as the Amazon woman turned heroine who is both a bad ass and an empathetic human being at the same time. It's so important to show characters like this, with women and people in underrepresented groups at the center. Aside from all that, the movie itself is fun! It's tightly paced and action packed from start to finish. The villain is a bit silly and some of the mystic elements are eye roll inducing. But generally, it's a solid and fun romp which is what super hero movies should be! Watch it and make sure the young women in your life see it. After seeing this movie, my 7 year old niece said: I didn't know a girl could be so strong? It made me tear up to know that she never thought it was possible. I'm glad this film was made.","3 out of 17 found this helpful.

As an avid fan of the DC universe, the DCEU, for the most part, was good, but I was slightly disappointed. 'Man of Steel' was the best before this one, but 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice's' muddled plot, made even comic book fans confused, and the disappointment of last year's 'Suicide Squad' was a let down. So thankfully Patty Jenkins came along to save the DCEU, by directing one of the best superhero films I've ever seen and my new favourite film of 2017!I think the main reason I loved 'Wonder Woman' was because,*cough* Gal Gadot *cough*, I loved the World War 1 setting. Watching her beat enemies up in the trenches and no man's land was entertaining and brilliantly filmed!
Chris Pine's character brought comedy and lightened the tone, which is not DC's way, but it was nice to see a change. This made watching the film a fun and enjoyable experience.The use of special effects as well was brilliantly done. The use of slow motion during fight scenes was mind blowing and made Wonder Woman even cooler then she already was!What 'Wonder Woman' did right was creating the best origin story for a superhero we've ever seen. It explores Diana Prince's past when she was a child, and learning to fight and battle with the 'Amazon's' to defeat 'Ares'. Speaking of 'Ares', I was extremely pleased to see one of the best DC villains for the first time in a live action DC film! He was played brilliantly by David Thewlis, in a creepy and sinister performance.Overall, Wonder Woman was good, but felt like the same superhero films we've been seeing for years.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

Though Gal Gadot was never my personal choice in the role, her commitment and dedication in her training to really make the part her own.The character sees Diana, an initially brave child to naive sheltered idealist among a group of proud and fearless female warriors, to discover the hard way world outside of Themyscira is not so black and white. The fight sequences, action scenes were spectacular with some Snyder-esque slomo.Gadot and Pine really work together, the right balance of comedy with Pine's awkwardness as Steve Trevor to the willful Diana, who is still her child at heart.My only two issues (these are very minor) are the Wonder Wooman suit (which Zack Snyder with costume designer Michael Wilkinson) had established in 'Dawn of Justice' and would have preferred the Germans to speak actual German instead of English with an accent.I give this film 8/10.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

From the second it came on screen, an action-filled soundtrack paired with flat two-dimensional graphics flooded the screen & allowed a glimpse of Wonder Woman's journey in life before she evolved into a pop culture world-while phenomenon. Her Amazon spirit set an entirely different tone for anyone who was used to the television version of Diana Prince.Gal Gadot, an Isreali actress, martial arts expert, and model easily stepped into the tall boots of the warrior princess and made the transition making us feel she wasn't just an actress playing a part. She breathed the essence of Diana, Princess of Themyscira - originally known in DC comics as Paradise Island. Wonder Woman showcases how loyal and fierce women can be in the same breath. It colors a bold picture of how hard we fight when there's a cause while still respecting the softer side of life. Diana showcases this brilliantly as she champions forth in her battles kicking ass and saving the world all in the name of love.The romantic chemistry between Gadot and Pine was just enough to paint a vivid picture of what happens behind closed doors, without being blatant or obscene. I loved the tenderness between these two. Their love symbolized so much in this film ... but again, I don't want to give any of the details away. I highly recommend this film for men and women alike as there's plenty of gore, action, and fight scenes that will satisfy the male population while providing insight into the female psyche offering a glimpse of humanity, tenderness, and passion for humankind.","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

"8","/10","Depth beyond Marvel, and a step up since Nolan","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3748756/?ref_=tt_urv","j-d-ignatius","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur57250199/?ref_=tt_urv","8 July 2017","I love the Marvel films, but in my opinion, the best superhero movies to be adapted to film are the Christopher Nolan Batman films. I consider these films to be the only ones that truly depict the complexity of the characters that were developed in the comics (even if they took some liberal assumptions into plotting). To the Non-Comic readers... don't lose me here. What I think is great about comics is the depth of which the characters are, or at least are intended to be, developed. They share the same, if somewhat more intense, experiences as typical people face. However, their experiences (combined with resources and abilities) allow them to make a larger impact for good or evil. Now, in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (Which again, I love), there is very little depth in character development. First film is always; gifted/rich Person->great tragedy- >overcoming hardships->superhero. Then the following films are simply a new foe. This allows MCU to crank out a new film every six months. However, in the Nolan films there is a depth of character and plot. For example, the underlying theme of fear. In Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne overcomes his fear of Bats, utilizes it as a strength, and then fights fear. Fear comes in the form in Batman Begins as ""a panic inducing toxin"" from Scarecrow, derived from a plant developed/provided by the league of shadows. Only by understanding fear is Bruce able to understand the implications of the League of Shadows' attack. In Dark knight, Joker serves as an ""agent of chaos"". Bruce understands this danger and is only able to overcome it through his resources and history with overcoming hardship. In Dark Knight Rises, fear is it in its greatest form.. All of Gotham in the prospect of annihilation. Bruce has already overcome his fear and defeated it, but didn't realize that fear is a necessity if ones intention is to reach true strength, which is a requirement to escape the prison and defeat the films depiction of fear and evil, Bane (again the league of shadows). Back to Wonder Woman. While not quite to the depth of the Nolan films, there is certainly a depth to her in character development by which she faces the fact that hate and war are innate human instincts. Though they may be instigated by the god, Ares, these traits are ingrained in all humans. This is a learning lesson for her, and one that she overcomes. By overcoming, she develops as a character, an Amazonian away from Themyscira, to a hero (if a confused one). None of this would be possible without the fantastic character depictions of Chris Pine and Gal Gadot. In summary I would say DC lost its track with suicide squad and batman vs. superman with the depth of plot, but they are on a great track with Wonder Woman. Best of luck for Justice League and beyond!","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

However, one day an American spy named Steve Trevor (Chris Pine) crash lands in the waters off the shore of Paradise Island and informs the Amazons of the horrors of The Great War, and the distinct possibility that those horrors may one day reach Themyscira itself. Suspecting Ares as the cause of World War I, Diana joins Steve on a journey to the front to face off against the maniacal General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) and the brilliant yet sadistic Doctor Poison (Elena Anaya) before they can unleash a new chemical weapon that will embroil the entire planet in endless war.Plus Points:1)Gal Gadot: Even now I wouldn't care about Wonder Woman if not for Gal Gadot.She is one of the most sexiest and cutest actress I have seen in recent times. Although the Israeli actress already proved herself as a scene-stealer in Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, Wonder Woman allows her to deliver a far more complex and nuanced performance. Gadot shows a surprising level of deftness with the film's comedic moments and the battle scenes continue to show her as one of the most capable female action stars working today. She throws herself into the fight scenes, and the sheer amount of physicality on display in this film is far more than anyone could ever demand from a live-action Diana Prince. Gal Gadot IS Wonder Woman and we would definitely expect DC to make a lot of movies with her.2)Music: Wonder Woman's another best part is its kick-ass theme music composed by Hans Zimmer.It is one of the best theme musics and its my current ringtone now.3)Screenplay: Wonder Woman's screenplay may not have nothing special but Gal Gadot and Chris Pine's combo along with few light heart moments and some kick-ass action sequences,Wonder Woman is highly entertaining.4)Chris Pine: Chris Pine delivered a mesmerizing performance as Steve Trevor with enough action,humor and innocence.Minus Points:1)Cliched Plot: Except with the use of war backdrop,Wonder Woman has clich√©d super hero plot.There will be no surprises and mostly a popcorn entertainment.2)Lengthy Climax: The film's climax is yet another bloated CGI spectacle, and the film's central antagonist is almost entirely forgettable when compared to the charm and emotional depth of its heroes.Weak Villain is another con for this film.So,Wonder Woman is a must watch for Gal Gadot's stunning performance and action.My rating 7.5/10","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

I'd reached the point of swearing off watching anything from either Marvel or DC, which has also been infected, albeit to a slightly lesser extent, with the leftist Virus which is simultaneously attacking all elements of American society, values and culture. Although this movie was released in 2017, I have avoided viewing it, and all other offerings from the cinematic super-hero world until just now (July 8th, 2018). I finally broke my promise to myself at the fervent behest of a dear friend who assured me that THIS movie would restore my faith and hope!
 Well, I'm here to tell you that, in my opinion, THIS movie is unarguably and without question the ABSOLUTE BEST I have seen-from EITHER brand!!! From the acting, to the plot line, characterizations, dramatic depth, and it's ability to draw the viewer in and deeply care....I cannot remember a movie of this genre with more going for it than this one!!! Gal Gadot was BORN to be Wonder Woman! The direction, editing, CGI and all other production values are off-the-charts STELLAR in quality!!! In terms of overall greatness, this leaves every single Marvel offering-including the entire Avenger-related and the pathetically pandering Black Panther ""wanna-be"" franchises IN THE DUST! I've given up on Marvel, but can only hope that more of the same will be forth-coming from DC!!!","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Not that I'm going to say it's some kind of tear inducing piece of theatrical perfection, because it's not. It has its faults like any other film: a superfluous and unnecessary framing sequence, the typical (albeit brief) pacing problems in the middle, repetitive action sequences (not counting the much lauded ‚Äì and deservedly so ‚Äì charge into ""No Man's Land"" scene) a cheesy ending (the levels and details of which I can't discuss without revealing major plot points) and a couple of lame jokes (how many times are they going to use the ""Wonder Woman loves ice cream"" gag?) ‚Äì most of which can be blamed on the screenplay by the usual suspects, Allan Heinberg and Zack Snyder.That being said, the positive things about Wonder Woman are legion in comparison.Obviously, the casting of Gal Gadot worked beautifully. Being one of the only positive elements in the abysmal Batman V Superman movie, her quality as the lead is now amplified. She already had the attitude and presence for the character, now bolstered by a more muscular physique and clearer (yet wonderfully distinct) accent. Gadot made it look easy, projecting power and confidence in her moral obligation to the world, while also having those moments of somewhat vulnerable naivet√© in a world she is only just discovering.Patty Jenkins is a thousand times the director that Zack Snyder is. She understands the value of a solid story and consistent character development. It was wonderful to see supporting characters developed enough to actually care about them, and the way Jenkins maneuvered through the potential political minefield this project presented was masterful. Case in point ‚Äì the aforementioned ""No Man's Land"" sequence. Not only was it a taught and exciting action scene, but the mutual respect and camaraderie that developed between the primary cast members was about as perfect a message about equality as one could hope for.Even subjects like the suffragette movement in the UK, employment, sexuality (cleverly referencing the writings of a Greek muse to explain the obviousness of lesbianism on Themyscira) (Chris Pine's awesome ""bathing beefcake"" scene) and even the white man's treatment of Native Americans were handled with humor and grace (instead of a browbeating), reminding me of the work of Michele Fazekas & Tara Butters on the excellent and lamented Agent Carter TV series. Perhaps it's easier when working on a period piece in 1916 where there are examples of sexism so obvious and blatant that everyone can look at it and go ""No, that is wrong."" There's even a pseudo-bondage scene near the end for those hardcore fans of Wonder Woman's early comic years.The supporting cast was excellent, with the possible exception of David Thewlis whose performance I found thoroughly uninspiring (especially in comparison to his work on the current season of Fargo) and some of Connie Nielsen's lines while trying to emulate Gadot's accent were a bit cringe inducing. All in all, it's a very positive movie experience in terms of both theme and quality. I'm actually disappointed it didn't have a bigger opening weekend considering super hero movies are still in vogue and Wonder Woman is one of the top 5 most recognizable and popular super heroes in history! It's relatively family-friendly ‚Äì aside from wartime violence (loud noises, deaths, etc) and the only love scene is alluded to but not shown.8.3/10 Easily the best DCU movie since 2008's Batman: The Dark Knight","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

I didn't hate Batman v. Superman as much as everyone else seemed to hate it, but the film was very flawed and could have been way better. For me, the best part of that film was the introduction of Wonder Woman to the film world. People wanted to criticize Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman before they even got to see her. I've heard it all from ""she's a no name actress"" to ""she's not busty enough for the role."" Having now seen Wonder Woman I think those arguments has to be put to rest as she brings the character to life and completely embodies Wonder Woman.The film is an origin story of Wonder Woman. We first find out how Diana of Themyscira came to be. We learn of the land of Amazons and how one day a pilot crashing into the island (played by Chris Pine) would change her life forever. She leaves with him, in a backdrop of European World War I, to London in order to find Ares (God of War) to end the war and the evilness of man. While her mission may sound ludicrous, it turns out she's not far off from the truth in what she seeks. Along the way she comes to grips with her power, her love for Steve Trevor, and what she must to do to stop the war and end suffering.I'm quite a fan of Wonder Woman. I don't always read up on comics but I've followed what I can WW wise. I watch the show with Lynda Carter on a weekly basis and have tried watching as many animated DC films with Wonder Woman as a can. I was pleased with this addition to the universe of Wonder Woman. Its the first good DC universe film (since it started with man of Steel). You won't see dark, somber tones and colors here. This film is pretty vibrant and light hearted when it can be. The period set design is excellent for a comic book film, sort of reminiscent of Captain America: The First Avenger.The cinematography is excellent especially at the beginning. Seeing the beautiful world of Themyscira is a joy to behold. It pops right onto the scene. For the most part the action scenes are filmed very well. I can't think of too many issues. My main gripe was the villain of the film feeling like it was shoe-horned in just to make everything more convenient. The film is quite long so the middle passage has to do a lot with getting introduced to the team that Trevor has assembled. I also think I missed how her hero costume came to be? There also isn't enough exposition and exploration into Doctor Poison or General Ludendorff; the film could have definitely benefited from more of that.I thought there was good chemistry between the two leads which makes the silly and humorous moments between them work. It's spectacular to watch Wonder Woman in action. Gadot looks great kicking butt and she completely absorbs the screen and your mind with every bullet she deflects and every giant leap she takes. The film isn't without flaws but its definitely the first good to great DC Universe film. We finally get to see Wonder Woman in full glory and power on the big screen. If you've been toiling through BVS and Suicide Squad in disappointment, I think you will really like this. Its a great entry by Patty Jenkins who should really helm the sequel.8.5/10","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Beauty alone does not make her a good actress. The entire time, you can see it in her face that she has little imagination and so was unable to deliver accurate emotions of rage, pain and sadness. There was a clear difference between her portrayal in this movie and the one that we first saw in Dawn of Justice. Wonder Woman is from an Island that is occupied only by women. They do everything themselves from building to fighting. There should not be any sassiness in her character. She is a warrior, and though she sure as hell kicked ass, those few moments where they showed her ""prettiness"" in otherwise intense moments totally ruined the weight of the scenes. She is beautiful, they didn't need to remind us 100 times. I hope they realize this and avoid it in the future.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

I have seen this self-answering question haunts in Thor's struggling confliction towards his brother Loki, a marital quarrel that Tony Starks snared with Pepper Potts, or even in that looming cavern that Bruce Wayne dwells in. The question is extremely elementary as well as phantasmally incomprehensible----who is and not a hero?This ancient puzzle has mazed human-beings since the very beginning of civilization, however, marvel series has bestowed that self- examination muse a fresh meaning, or to say a new bottle to hold new wine. From millennium battle between Amazon Diana and Ares the incarnation of war and chaos to Peter Benjamin Parker's vigilantism practice on Dr. Octopus, it seems that our heroes with incredibly powerful talents are eventually no more than any other human. The apparent weakness, almost each individual has severely suffered from, like thorn in their flesh, is where their power generates, the flaw in their characters, sometimes a considerably imperfection, has ironically inspired our protagonists to venture deeper into the valley of death, combating their archenemies dauntlessly. Yet sometimes after justice has been done, they too, like other common folks, facing unfounded accusations and vile slanders from the very people they saved.Isn't it true that heroes do not exist, that no one is strong enough to redeem himself let alone the whole world. Isn't it also true that in fact every human being is capable of self-exaltation to a case of hero, to stand out, fight for what freedom and love demands.Corinthians 12:10 That is why, for Christ sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships.

It is hard to make a film that tells an origin story, makes a definitive social point of view, is entertaining and above all looks and feels original. Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman does all that and more. It has an anti-war message at heart. And has feminism running in it's veins. And mind you - the good kind of feminism (less hate and anger and more fair opportunity). Not to mention it is a film set in WW1 which is actually reflective of today's times.What drives it is an incredible turn by Gal Gadot whose persona literally makes every scene watchable. Her expressions of surprise, anger, love and empathy pretty much turns Wonder Woman (quite a fantastic superhero if you read the comics) into the most realistic superhero since Nolan's Batman trilogy. She gets full support from Chris Pine (As the superhero 'girlfriend') who does everything right and to be fair is an A-list actor. His scenes of him trying to explain the reality of humankind to WW are alone worth making WW a re-watch. Superhero films definitely need more girlfriend/boyfriend characters like that. The action sequences are breathtaking. It also finally explains what is wrong with the DC extended universe which is indeed one man - 'Zack Snyder' and the studio should simply change him for a better director maybe - 'Patty Jenkins'. Jenkins btw had disappeared after Monster and returns more than a decade (13 years to be precise) later to the big screen to give us a film that will easily feature in the top 5 superhero movies of all times. Dont miss this one - arguably one of the best films of what was a terrible movie year 2017.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

Nope, but it does soar to the great lengths of recovery to being one of the best DC films since The Dark Knight. Firstly, Gal Gadot shines incredibly in the role. Having shown this in a small role in BVS, it's here she's given everything to show emotion, strength and agility to the character well known to comic fans and female followers. I won't lie but I did doubt her in the role when she was first cast but seeing her in the role has really blew expectations. The supporting cast as well were all great, giving purpose to the story and pacing and humour wasn't so heavily forced it does work.The plot here is actually decent and there's no flaws like SS did, it has a decent amount of time for character development, connection and purpose (like the purpose to why Diana wants to make a better place of the world), tightly shot but awesome action sequences, great production design and value (the Greek world of the Amazonians to the gritty realism of war in the real world) and a solid director with a keen eye on storytelling. Patty Jenkins was a great choice to helm this first ever female superhero movie, delivering one that will surely won't be a failure with critics and the box office.While with no signs of negativity present (despite the CGI overuse in the third act) WW is a great treat for all fans and audiences alike, with great detail in character development, solid action, amazing production design and value and a great leading lady as the female superhero. Believe me, it's indeed up there with Logan and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 in my best films for the year list and probably the best DC Extended Universe film so far.4/5 - The Autistic Reviewers","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

It stands out for several reasons, one of them being that there are more elements from fantasy than science fiction in this movie.First and most important and obvious thing has to be the fact that it has a female lead. It's ridiculous that it has taken this long for DC or Marvel to actually make a movie with a woman playing the main role, considering there are amazing heroines in the comic books. Diana is an amazing character, because while she's being a hero and kicking ass, she can still be a woman. There are tons of characters who are ""strong female characters"" while strength being their only defining characteristic. But Diana actually has feelings and is feminine without being just eye candy for the male viewers, while still looking absolutely stunning, though. One thing that bothers me is the excessive use of CGI and slow motion and all that, but Wonder Woman definitely isn't the only movie guilty of that.Storywise this movie is enjoyable, and I felt amazing after I saw that. Is that how men feel all the time when they see other men in superhero movies constantly?","1 out of 8 found this helpful.

You know, in these times where women feel they are underpaid in Hollywood. They probably are, but the point is, this kind of thinking leads peoples thoughts elsewhere.Just like with the new Ghostbusters, a movie i thought was bad, it just didn't work. But somehow the makers of the film managed to get people to think it was because they hated black women or women in general, and that the haters were Trump supporters. Which of course were not the case, the movie was bad, plain and simple. It's pretty amazing that such an assemble of funny women can be so boring.So just to be clear, i do not think of these things before i see a film, like many seem to do, i see the film for what it is, and could care less who acts in them or makes them.So, ""Wonder Woman"" scores high almost everywhere, people are praising it for it's cast, for it's visuals, for it's storytelling. Well damn, i better go and see this movie asap then, which i did, bought myself a ticket on the premiere day in my country and now i just got back from the cinema.In the last years i have not been too found of the DC universe movies, and it hurts me to the core that i feel like this. I feel Zack Snyder was not the right man for ""man of steel"" and ""Batman v Superman"". The movies are just effect bonanzas with weak plots and weak scripts.I grew up reading batman and superman comics, it was a big part of my life as a kid. I also read He-man, M.A.S.K., Conan and HULK among many others. I loved comics, and still do. Marvel found a movie formula that works, where most of their films are good or great, and if you count the x-men universe, Logan is one of the finest superhero films of all time. Marvel just spew out one awesome film after the other, where DC seem to be tripping in the dark (Only counting the DCEU so far here). Another good example of this is ""Suicide Squad"".But apparently, this is now about to change, because with ""Wonder Woman"", DC finally shows us that they can, and now I've regained some hope that ""Justice League"" actually can be good, and mostly because Joss Whedon has taken over, and he is going to do re-shoots, he is going to cut it his way and he has just hired Danny Elfman as the composer.Danny Elfman wrote the best superhero theme of all time with ""Batman (1989)"", There is no comparison, it's just THE superhero theme. And Joss Whedon directed ""The Avengers"", which is one of the best superhero films i have ever seen. So yes, now i believe. To bad it took the destruction of two movies with two my favorite superheros to get to this, but anyways, here we are.I got to praise Patty Jenkins for her work on this film, and as critics have already said, this might be a turning point for female directors in Hollywood, and as long as they make as good films as the men, of course they deserve same pay and same benefits, it's only logical. One thing is for sure, Patty Jenkins has made a far better movie than Zack Snyder managed to do.At it's core ""Wonder Woman"" is sort of just another good guys vs bad guys film, where again the evil Germans is the latter. It can get tiresome, when this is all Hollywood can come up with in terms of bad guys, but in this case, it actually works. The way the story is told, and how the plot is executed, i didn't really think of it as just another USA with it's heroes beats up the evils of this world. Yes i know, it's suppose to be about the British in this film, but i noticed they sneaked in the American flag a few places, just to make sure we weren't fooled into thinking someone else made this film.This movie has a lot of heart, and it is executed with care, with good character buildup and a strong Gal Gadot at it's core, who carries this movie with ease. And i just got to admit, Gal is so easy to love, i mean, what a gorgeous woman she is. Absolutely incredibly beautiful, with towering charisma, and the camera loves her. I can't remember to have seen a woman with such a powerful screen semblance since Grace Kelly.Well, anyways, Now that i got that off my chest, let's move on shall we.The actions scenes in this film are there to build upon the story, not the other way around, and i hope DC continues this way, and not fall into the Zack Snyder trap again. The movie starts slowly, it takes it's time to let us get to know Diana, which is very important to understand her views and values, but when the big actions scenes finally arrive, they pack a heavy punch. The choreography is awesome, the fighting scenes are a pure joy to watch, and they are powerfully executed, as Diana slowly but steady learns her true powers over the course of the film, and we are right there, learning them with her.""Wonder Woman"" is indeed a spectacular movie, with fantastic visuals, strong performances, great photography, steady direction and a good script. What drags the film down is the plot, which is very predictable, but not a big deal really. This movie is solid fun, and i strongly recommend it.The DC universe needed this movie more than anything.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

Who else who looks like Gadot could pull off the battle sequences so convincingly? It would seem absolutely moronic if he cast a sheltered beauty queen from America-- before this movie was released, many of his critics wanted him to use a busty, curvy American model instead of her.Gal IS Wonder Woman. With all due respect (and the respect is well deserved) to Lynda Carter, she owns that tiara now. I can't imagine that they will ever find a more perfect actress for the part when Gal hangs it up.Other than my adulation for Gal, I want to state as a World War I buff that director Patty Jenkins and her crew arranged the period pieces and the CG period pieces perfectly. I didn't see anything that struck me as out of place-- among the inanimate objects, anyway.Maybe it would seem odd at the time that an American (Chris Pine's character) was working solely with British intelligence as a spy or-- especially more confounding-- that a native American just randomly joined the battle in Europe as some sort of rogue agent for hire. But we must use the same suspension of disbelief that we use when we accept that Wonder Woman is a princess from an enchanted island who must fulfill her prophecy of destroying a god of war.Gadot's sensuous and intense facial expressions, her sweetness, her awesomeness in the role-- that's what I took from this movie even when the story went off the rails sometimes.Henry Cavill is probably the worst Superman ever in film or TV, Ben Affleck makes for a great Batman, and Gadot is incomparable as Wonder Woman. I'm looking forward to seeing how The Flash and Aquaman will play.","1 out of 10 found this helpful.

Despite the trailer looking good, memories of previous DC universe movies put me off - do I really want to see a po-faced movie about an Amazonian goddess? Well, OK so I admit the prospect of seeing Gal all 'Wondered' up was appealing but just how appealing? Hmm...So, the good reviews convinced me. No too ways about it, if this had received bad reviews I'd have not touched it with a barge pole but phew! All is good in the world again :)I really don't want to give away anything, I just want people to go see the movie because it is genuinely one of the best superhero movies in recent years and I think it's all down to the amount of humour they've injected - remember those laughs from Superman and Superman Vs Batman? No? That's because there weren't any and jeez they were boring...To sum the movie up, it's well written, directed, acted and shot* so really do just go see it and thank me later!*Ok, small caveat - some of the special effects are laughable but as the script is quite witty it's easy to loom beyond them, no really - you'll see ;)","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

I'd even go so far as to say they haven't been good. Fortunately for Warner Brothers, Wonder Woman is far better than their latest crop of movies and actually rivals the recent clutch of Marvel films. For once, DC didn't screw this up.Gal Godot is Wonder Woman as Margot Robbie was Harley Quinn. I am hard pressed to think of any actress that could do the role better. But unlike Suicide Squad, the writing wasn't an abomination of cringe worthy dialogue and very short sighted plot development. There are moments of cringe, I'll get to that later, but by and large the movie is simple in focus and coherent in practice. She has a single goal, defeat Ares and end WWI, and a character of someone would understand and somewhat expect from someone of her up bringing. She was raised as royalty on a secluded island, put through extreme training far exceeding her peers, and had been constantly fed the same story. When she grows up and is exposed to the world at large, she is headstrong, a little stupid, but strong enough to brute force her way through any situation. She charges into no man's land without a second thought, tries to assassinate a German general in the middle of a gala surrounded by soldiers, and is so dead set on killing Ares that she is easily fooled into suspecting the wrong man to be him. And she does all this because she doesn't know any better. On all accounts she is her own worst enemy, she knows the pointy end of a sword from the not the pointy end in a time where bolt action rifles have replaced swords, but like a good baby face she still muscles up the fortitude to persevere.The effects are good with a couple exceptions here and there but they are a little overused. Seeing her block bullets is cosmetically pleasing, they use slowdown well so that you can see the bullet pancake, the first few times. Then they keep doing it. Again and again, just enough to kill the impact of the effect but not enough to frustrate the audience. They merely get numb to it. Still, the no man's land scene was very well done, with tracer bullets exploding against her shield and slapping a mortar out of the air. There are times where the CGI is terrible however and they usually involve hitting guns. They crumple under her fist in a way that looks like a cinematic from a PS2 game. You know they aren't real things in the environment.As I said, there are a few gaffes here and there. When the Germans try to capture Steve Trevor, you can see gun boats in the distance but they didn't play any role in the battle with the Amazons. You'd think they'd at least try to bombard the island after learning the inhabitants are hostile, or at least clear the cliffs so their ground troops could land safely. Mustard gas has no effect on Diana, she charges in to find an entire town dead and while Trevor can't get near the cloud, she walks out as right as rain. Furthermore, the movie takes place at the closing of the war but mustard gas has not been used yet nor is it ever used on enemy soldiers. They even ignore the fatal flaw of such a weapon, the threat of the wind blowing it back at your own troops. Theoretically, the Hitler in their universe would be even worse than the Hitler of ours. Not witnessing the horrible effects of poison gas first hand, he would not have detested such a weapon so much not to use it on the front lines. But these are relatively minor gripes, and they don't really mount to much.The one terrible thing about this movie I can ascribe, it failed to live up to its purpose. This movie was a set up for the upcoming Justice League movie. I don't want to see the Justice League movie, I want Wonder Woman 2. This movie out hyped the headliner which can be bad news for WB. That being said, while I want a sequel, I know it cannot live up to the expectations of this one. And that is because of the choice of villain, Ares. There is no one in her villain menagerie that can follow him. She went from zero to the second coming of Jesus and smite the devil in one movie. I'm not saying Blue Snowman should have got top billing but had they started with a major villain like Barrenness Paula von Gunther, they could have built for him to star in a sequel or even a third movie. After this, who is going to believe a regular human NAZI is going to pose any threat to a killer of gods? No one, because WB wanted to churn a quick set up for a movie that already looks like a dumpster fire. All this universe garbage killed any chance of a good sequel.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.

Then one-day Diana (Gal Gadot) was visited by a pilot (Chris Pine) from that outside world. After learning of the outside world, Diana had a quest to say mankind. She had no idea who she was or where her quest would take her physically and emotionally.We travel through the world and learn with Diana about destiny and purpose.Unfortunately, this is a standard contemporary superhero film.

Negatives: 1. Really bad science such as jumping off a moving horse and landing without a forward momentum. Failed middle school science. Effortless jumps of hundreds or more feet. Would work if we knew what force (other than leg muscles) she utilized, but none given as none exists even in ""Wonderland"". 2. Grade school dialogue with lots of petty arguments amongst the Amazonians which is unworthy of their stature (pun). 3. Lots of middles ages weapons and fighting skills. Why just that period of tech & culture? For a people who live forever you would think they would educate themselves to something a little better, or at least venture into ""man's"" world and borrow a few ideas. Dumb! 4. Since they don't venture into ""man's"" world how and why does each person learn a 100 different languages, to what end. More dumb. 5. Why all the makeup? 6. Why the synthetic Hollywood costume shop plastic looking clothing that never seems to get dirty or torn? 7. Action scenes were stereotypic, non-creative, borrowing of the same moves found in all action flicks. One typical puzzler is while she's being shot at (several hundred rounds/min) by several machine guns she just stands there holding a shield for upper body protection leaving legs exposed yet not a single round strays in that direction. Add in wrist bullet deflectors and the really cheap CGI of electrical zapping and her wonder skills become laughing skills. 8. Acting was moronic & robotic to satisfy middle school audiences willing to accept anything with attractive women. Add in the romantic scenes for money making audience appeal which did nothing to enhance her specialness. 9. Overbearing musical/sound effects give-away and often used to bolster shallow plots in movies. 10. Made a mockery of Greek classical characters. Summary: Very cartoonish level writing, acting, effects.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

Gal Gadot is beautiful but way too Auchwitz-survivor-looking to play the part of a strong amazon warrior, the love interest was boring, Wonder Woman was a blithering retard throughout the majority of the flick, there was no villain (turning some random guy into a cgi mess to wrap up the sh*t-pile last minute hardly counts), the cgi work was far below what should be expected these days, the writing was boring and highly predictable. The one thing I liked, the idea that mankind are not wholly good or evil almost got me back on board in the final act before the cgi monster came out and ruined the whole idea. Wonder Woman is a poor-mans Captain America: The First Avenger, just with the genders reversed and about half the quality across the board. Female characters can be strong, but this is not one.If you paid money to see this slop you are part of the problem, don't see anymore DC flicks.","6 out of 14 found this helpful.

You can take the better episodes of Lynda Carter's 1970s TV series or just about any of 2015's Agent Carter (with Hayley Atwell), and you'll find more impressive acting and a touch of humour as well.I enjoy good superhero movies and admittedly I don't expect the writing and story twists employed in this genre to be stellar; however, even a Gail Gadot with super acting powers couldn't save this one. The back story at the start of the film is passably interesting, but then the story just degenerates into good guys versus Nazis, which ""has been done"" more than a few times already. The writing, such as it is, is flat and the overuse of CGI makes the film appear even worse.

In fact I don't mind watching shlock when it's super low budget and that's the expectation but WW was a multi-million dollar 'blockbuster' and on that basis it should be trounced. WW epitomises the worst aspects of modern film-making: paper-thin plots designed around set-pieces and action sequences with the laziest effort to make things hang together even for five minutes. There is 'suspending your disbelief' and then there's insulting the audiences intelligence. It might have worked well as a plot for a music video.It's so bad its hard to know where to start. It's not that the direction or cast are spectacularly bad though I bet they are all thanking the stars that WW didn't make it through to any serious film-awards as this will be one they will want to forget. David Thewlis particularly feels a sad waste for such a film. Pine was built for these kind of roles as one can never take him seriously anyway (I think he's perfect as Shatner's Kirk).Gadot is bearable but I'd only give her hammy over-acting a pass as she is trying to demonstrate the naivety of the character. This could have been handled much more subtley to better effect. If anything the praise should go to her stunt doubles and the editors for making her appear the slightest bit athletic.Whilst Snyder is the writer it feels like he proxy-directed the whole thing as it has all his hallmarks. Its not that he doesn't have his moments it's just he comes across as a one-trick pony rather than a seasoned director capable of delivering what the story needs. On that basis I'm not sure what Patty Jenkins achieved herself with this. Definitely a huge step backwards from Monster (but then not much else in the last 14 years?).The setting as world war one was a terrible mistake and contradiction. I could understand a really simple-stupid movie aimed at kids but it clearly isn't. Mixing candy-floss nonsense with the dark ravages of war just to make a protracted point (men are evil). Deaths are frequent and all too easy which often feels like poor taste.The characters are all stereotypes, paperthin and cliched - nothing original at all which adds to the boredom as you genuinely feel you have seen everything before.The pacing is poor and again this is poor storytelling and scripting. There have been very many successful films which have told a back story interweaved through the experiences of the main character as an alternative to dragging through an hour just to reach the main acts of the film. You can wander off and make a cup of tea several times and you won't really miss anything of subtance either.Even the action is awful.. typically over-used Snyder-esque slow-mo sequences. Used sparingly this can be a great technique to emphasise a moment (as employed within the Matrix) but use it as the main effect and it drags the pace of everything down and loses that natural excitement of keeping up with fast complex action. You never reach the end of a point and think 'wow', what did I just see.CGI generally has come good over the last 10 years, really good, but this is back to some of the cheesiest effects you will see on film. And the more they throw at you the more your brain goes 'meh'. Its like making a 2hr film just composed of CGI explosions - after 2 minutes you'll be bored to tears.Some will like it - probably those types who can't sit in a cinema for more than a minute without opening another bag of crisps or checking their phone. For them the film will work well as those kind of interruptions won't spoil anything. But if you've got anything else to do with your life today, do that instead.","5 out of 11 found this helpful.

So would it be the film to change my mind about this genre? It is good. It's refreshing to see strong female characters, all the female characters in fact and Gadot is worthy of most of the praise she received. The action sequences are fun, Matrix inspired slamfests and there's few good jokes thrown in that did make me chuckle. It's far too long though, with a storyline that (I know its a superhero fantasy plot) is weak, plodding, often boring, unimaginative and generally crap. The cast is pretty underwhelming, with even the usually relieable Thewlis leaving me with a feeling of disappointing lacklustre. It made a killing at the box office, so of course they're making another one, but I won't be bothering. Superhero films are, for me, still a waste of time, in this case over 2 hours of it!","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Whenever I am presented with something that is supposed to get an emotional response out of me it eventually feels like a botched effort for various reasons. One instance fails to be impactful, so I feel like I'm watching a seminar where some statistics are mentioned, another is stating the obvious so plainly, I feel like I'm watching a recap of the movie instead of the movie itself. There's one distinctly Greek thing this movie doesn't have, but should have adopted before anything else: the makes of a good drama.I have a particular and very subjective criticism about one thing. When German people talk among themselves, they speak English with a blatantly fake German accent. This is not Assassin's Creed, where half of the movie ended up being Spanish, in this movie it would have been perfectly fine to hear authentic German language and read subtitles for those 10 minutes.And last but not least: The last time CG physics made me chuckle like this was when I watched Tyrannosaurus Azteca, a 2.9 rated movie on a $2.5 mil budget. Now that movie is so bad it's good. This movie is just bad.","10 out of 28 found this helpful.

I mostly came up with points that were about how contrary the movie kept being in terms of ideas already established. For me this is unforgivable as it ruins the flow of the movie and makes you doubt how much thought was put into maintaining continuity and facts presented. My girlfriend was more about how they had change aspects of the story of Wonder Woman and her origin and she's not big on that either as the lore is long since established and she like it when the movies stay true to the sources, as they should but are regularly changed for convenience of the film makers. Both of us were pretty bored by the fact that there were no stakes. Wonder Woman was just Superman in a skirt, could fire lazer beams, could fly, could throw a tank, could be pummeled multiple times BY A GOD and she didn't bare a single scratch. It's like playing Doom back in the day in God Mode, boring. We were also nonplussed by the fact that there was a warrior who was waving her sword around like a fool who and like it was made of foam when coming out of department store or wondering how WAR works, despite having been shown that she was highly educated (to degrees that are quite impossible and immersion breaking). None of the characters spoke like they were in the 191X's and a SAIL boat can sail from what must have been the Mediterranean (given the Ottoman placement) to London overnight. There is I suppose if you can be like the popcorn consumption juggernauts behind us and turn your brain off, or are oblivious to geography and common sense this would be a pretty good movie but if you can't and you have to be 'one of those people' who must have a story make sense and have reasons behind actions, clear morals and ethics and demand some tension created by stakes you're only going to think this is just another average 'unbelieveably overpowered, unstoppable, godlike being makes holes in CGI things'.

Gal Gadot has ruined what Lynda Carter excelled at. Wonder Woman was never about glorified, unnecessary violence. She was a voice of reason, compassion and restrained strength. Gal is none of these. She is no hero and she's an appalling role model. Ignoring physical strength, she's not strong, she's not logical in her reasoning and her feats set fans up for a huge downfall with an unrealistic ""hero"" (to quote the press).This movie is filled with violence and most of it is unnecessary. Yes, we get it, girl power, right? The idea is that more violence is supposedly better, or something along those lines. This movie is another bore fest along the same lines as most of the marvel movies. There is nothing intelligent, fresh or clever (except the violence is even more over the top than any other comic conversion movie).The story from beginning to end is illogical and almost incoherent. A group of hyper warrior females who don't do anything constructive (eg. farming) aggressively battle each other day and night. It's not clear why they do this because when the going gets tough, they refuse to fight, except with a group of German soldiers who they attack before they even know they are enemies. These types of illogical double standards continue throughout the entire movie. Violence is really awesome when it suits the story, but it's occasionally abhorred when it's an elderly grandmother. As a largely peaceful person, I found the logic of violence worship very disturbing (despite the media frenzy about needing extreme violence to represent ""female heroes"").There is not a single actor whose performance I enjoyed. Gal was a huge let down. Flipping between empathy and aggression indiscriminately. Chris Pine played the fragile ""handsome"" man who was too busy hero worshipping a false god. Across the entire cast, I can't think of a single memorable performance.If you get your rocks off on meaningless gratuitous violence (and bucket loads of it), you'll love this movie. If you don't care about meaningful characters or a coherent plot, even better. Everyone else - save your money. This is the worst movie i've seen this year. If this is what society deems the new breed of ""hero"", then it's a very sad indictment indeed.","10 out of 29 found this helpful.

Its heart is in the right place. It's thematically bang on. It's important. I'm very glad it exists. I'm glad it's being universally praised. It has some fantastic costume work in it and some strong production design. It is, indeed, better than recent previous attempts at bringing DC characters to the big screen (but then the bar has been set pretty low). I see little girls dressing as the protagonist and it makes my heart sing. I see comic book stores hosting Wonder Woman Day, I see the world falling in love with a character that I've always adored. These are all wonderful things. I was very excited for this flick. When the reviews were coming in strong, I let my hopes get high. I admit that I actively ignored my Rotten Tomatoes rule of thumb (any movie with more than 90% RT rating has a huge probability of sucking).But the film is, subjectively, pretty bad.It is overwrought. It is written as if by algorithm, meaning that it is simply an amalgamation of standard scenes you've seen before in other movies, just reskinned for this world and this character, everyone acts out every scene in extremely predictable ways. Its third act fight scene is extremely problematic and boring. It is inconsistent, Wonder Woman's presence and powers fluctuate so wildly that she can fight and kill a god, but not a handful of German's with WW I era rifles on a beach? The CGI is criminally bad, the physics in the special effects shots are so off that it seems like I'm watching a last gen video game.Its dialogue has exactly three modes: exposition, clumsy attempts at humor, and stating out loud the thematic intent of the scene.Its fight scenes are more often excuses to pose the character than acts of complex, readable staging, particularly the awful final fight. The use of slow motion in the fight scenes is so reliable and consistent that it seems like a parody of Zach Snyder's already completely unengaged video game fight choreography.The villains mean nothing. They are uninspired, dreary, and underutilized. Apart from seeing the very well visualized Themyscira, and the handful of times we get to see Wonder Woman in action, there is very little fun to be had in this movie. There is almost nothing that feels inventive and most of the film is colored in that same drab, dreary way that all of the recent DC films are colored.The movie is looooong, with a running time that used to be reserved for movies like The Piano, The Godfather, and Apocalypse Now, films with sprawling cinematic, thematic, and emotive ambitions that this does not even begin to have.Lastly, I can't tell if Gadot is incapable of acting or if the script gave her so little of substance to work with that she did an amazing job just keeping it all together.I have to ask why? Why does the DC universe so actively avoid fun, immersive, well crafted, and inventive storytelling? Why do they double down on this faux-epic, dismal pap? Why are they so afraid of color? Of bold comic-book like choices? Personally, I wish I had watched a little bit of Wonder Woman on cable and then turned it off like I have every other recent DC movie, but maybe voting with my dollar at least helped change the backward ass notion that women can't open big budget movies.Oh, well. As I said, the most important thing is that this movie exists, that people like it and that the character is back in the spotlight. That's all that matters. My opinion certainly doesn't. This wasn't a soulless or intellectually bankrupt film like the other DC movies have been, it was just bad, but maybe bad is good enough.","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

In Batman versus Superman, Gadot was the only shining light. She was again the point of interest in this story with Chris Pine's doing a good job. The Amazons were great characters. But one character proved totally out of place for his role in the film. The special effects were kind of sucky with everything looking fake. With all its stellar reviews, the audience was silent after the movie was over and everyone rushed for the exits; that's not a good sign. I know the film will make money but DC will continue to follow Marvel instead of leading.","8 out of 22 found this helpful.

And sometimes the formula works, wether it's because the film-making, writing and acting is just that good, or because an element is added or style is changed. Here however, we have the basic dumb plot with the same special effects we've seen again and again. Are we really this gullable? Have we been fed with this so long that our best defence for cinema like this is ""Sometimes you just want to shut down the brain.""?The style of Wonder Woman is so USA that it feels like a parody. The action shots are too quick and emotionless, I feel like I'm watching actors fight with special effects instead of watching superheroes battling important fights. The music is bland, like the rest of the Marvel Universe Film Series, with the exception of one rocking song played a couple of times during the film (f.e. during a fight in a room with guns and a table). We see no real shine among the actors or the dialogue.Before I watched this I actually heard it was supposed to be a bit feministic. I found the opposit to be true, what with men and women having stereotypical film traits and the women being scantily clad for the enjoyment of the eye and objectification. What annoyed me the most about this was that Wonderwoman herself, who was supposed to be this extremely powerful superhero with high intelligence, was constantly made out to be dumb and weak. I was hoping that for once a female superhero could have the spotlight the men of the USA superhero genre has, with the same coolness and ability. Instead we follow along as Wonderwoman gets babysat throughout the film by a male character who sometimes actually feels like the protagonist instead of Wonderwoman.The three stars it gets is for the high production and the dull enjoyment, and the good moments the movie did have.","3 out of 6 found this helpful.

It gradually gets better, but there are still parts that make you want to die throughout the movie. I don't know how all of the rotten tomatoes critics are overlooking the plot holes in this film. There are probably more plot holes in this movie than planets in the universe. The writing is really clich√©. Before a character does something important, they have a dramatic, five minute speech. There is one part where an evil person shouts: ""I WILL DESTROY YOU!"" I was laughing really hard at how bad the writing and acting was in that scene. It then launched into a fully CGI fight. And as for the story: it isn't really that good, and there is a plethora of plot holes.

It really suits her, just like Robert Downey Jr. was born to play Iron Man, or Hugh Jackman to play Wolverine, I really think she is the perfect choice to play Wonder Woman. Music in the movie was excellent, visuals were really good for the most part of the movie, and costumes were pretty good too.Now that we got those things out of the way, we have negatives, and boy is that a long list. Casting for this movie was horrible. I cannot express how bad it was. Every single character besides Gal Gadot's was horrible, acting was over the top, at moments reminded me of villains from Austin Powers. Character development was non- existent. People just appear from out of nowhere, they introduce themselves and that's it, literally no explanation or what they do, or even why are they in the movie, they have no purpose, nor do they contribute to the story line. I am trying not to give any spoilers, so I am not mentioning any names, but I was shocked with the choice and development of the main bad guy. He was horrible. Movie has dark and serious tone, but they tried to break that with a few silly jokes, and corny humor, which completely didn't work. Script was bad. Really bad. They tried to pull female version of Captain America, but they failed miserably. I really don't wanna watch another Wonder Woman movie, at least not in Cinema, maybe I would pirate it, because it was worth no money.And yes, rating that it has got, it is really feminist-hyped for no obvious reason. Movie is truly bad.","6 out of 16 found this helpful.

I did see the 96% score on RT but it didn't make a difference because I was fairly sure it was the whole ""feminism"" thing that propelled the score. There is no way this movie was going to be better than movies like Shawshank or La La Land or any high rated Marvel movie. In short it isn't but its a fairly competent movie. My biggest problem with the movie is the ""formulaicness"" of it. It seems like it is just following the superhero movie formula. Especially the way the third act was realized. My second biggest problem is the huge miscast of the villain (not the general but the other one). The actor that plays him (who I will not mention cause it's a spoiler) is great in general but he didn't fit this role at all. Some jokes that are completely directed towards men are a bit forced. Some are pretty funny though. Some of the action scenes were overflowing with slow motion which is epic and grand for the first 10 seconds but then it becomes too much and it stops being a film technique and starts being a gimmick. There are quite a few action scenes that felt a bit wonky in the choreography area and cgi area. There are moments in this movie that I can only describe as cheesy. I hate the word when it comes to film but it really works here. In general the flaws make this movie a flick and it would be a bad one if it weren't for the good qualities. Gal Gadot is great. I liked her portrayal even though she is in no way revolutionary, she can fall flat sometimes in the film when it comes to facial expressions and conveying emotion. In my opinion Chris Pine steals the show when it comes to character arc and acting. His character was the funniest and most charming in the film and maybe in all of dc's films. There is a decision that the writers decided to make for Pines character at the very end of the movie that delighted me because it doesn't usually happen in these types of superhero movies. Or even movies in general as a matter of fact. Good on them. Bremner, Taghmaoui and Rock play sidekicks to Pine's character and all of them did their job well. The main villain was fine and so was the other one. The story was fine, the action was mostly fine, the cinematography was a bit more than fine, the effects were mostly fine and the acting was great. There are more fines than greats in this movie so that's why I'm giving it a lower rating than others. Mainly because this film is just competent. Not brilliant.6.8/10","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

Then I was too revolted not to write a review about it.Of course you have stereotypes and cheesiness but the scenario is also utterly ridiculous. How can we even picture world war I in such an uneducated and stereotyped way? How come Germans all speak English with a German accent? How come we can predict everything that will happen before they take place?Anyone who is telling me this movie is ""feminist"" because it has a ""strong female character"" is mistaken! If this movie really wanted to do justice to women: 1¬∫ - Wonderwoman would be more than a piece of meat in a sexy armor. 2¬∫ - She would have realistic qualities (something else than a supernatural force: because, let's face it, her only 2 qualities are that she is beautiful and unrealistically strong.) 3¬∫ - There would be other female characters who are not pictured as either stupid or mean 4¬∫ - Wonderwoman is not even intelligent and does not even reflect on the situation: they told her that ""war was bad so you have to end war"" and so that's all she can say ""war is so bad and terrible, I have to end it with my superpowers"".This is the kind of production that thinks their audience is too dumb: everything has to be explained and the music tells the viewer how to feel about each situation (very ""evil music"" for the very mean characters, goofy music for the supposedly funny moments, heroic music for the ""superwoman is so strong moments"", cheesy sad music when we are supposed to feel sad,...).Please don't watch this movie, this might burn some of your neurons.","5 out of 13 found this helpful.

I find it comical that instead of training to lose her accent (like most great actors do for a film) they made the entire world that she comes from have her natural, israeli accent. Why?!
You can also tell that throughout the whole movie she struggles to match the acting ability of her co-stars.

Despite its popularity and all the rave reviews, it is mediocre at best. Gal Gadot herself is wonderful and a perfect choice for the part. She is able to project both the strength, courage and determination of a superhero, as well as empathy, love and happiness with equal ease. Her lithe, athletic form fits well into the costume, highlighting her natural sexiness. She is every bit the fighter you would expect, the worthy successor to the warrior tradition of her mother and her aunt. The scenes on her home island are the best in the film. I enjoyed watching the character as a young child and later beginning her training. Robin Wright again demonstrates her acting skills in a small but memorable role as Antiope. The training and battle sequences on the island are a pleasure to watch. The use of super slow-motion is truly amazing.But then of course, it is time for our young heroine to leave the island....and the movie promptly falls apart. The entire storyline becomes absolutely ludicrous. And I don't mean ""comic-book"" silly, I mean downright stupid. The grossly-overrated Chris Pine is hopelessly overmatched by Gadot, and the ancillary characters are the predictable group of politically-correct caricatures. Half the characters in the film could simply have been written out completely. The final superhero battle does restore some dignity, but not as much as it should. By that point, the ridiculous plot had so insulted my intellect and wasted my time that I had already begun to check my watch ‚Äì which is always my personal gauge for a film's success or failure. Watch this film, just to see Gal Gadot. She really is the embodiment of a superhero.

Many in the first and last partitions seem to be rating it because they think that the film deserves a higher or lower rating than what it received, despite them not actually thinking the movie is a 1-2 or a 7-10 star movie. If we're assuming a 1 star is just almost the worst movie, and a 10 star movie is almost perfect, nobody can honestly watch this movie and call it a 1 or a 10 star movie.Truthfully, it's an incredibly mediocre movie, with poor acting from several cast members, obviously poor CGI in many parts, and a god-awful story that struggles to hold the attention of a pre-teen that cannot justify a 7-10 star review. However, some of the actors are too good, some CGI too impressive, and the action too interesting for it to be 1 star.Don't trust the reviews of the people that rate it that way because they want to skew the rating in a certain direction. From someone that loves action and superhero movies, it's a 4/10 on a good day. I wouldn't want to watch movies with those that rate it outside of the 2-6 star range.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

This is the same origin story as everyone else in the Marvel and DC universes. The character has a quest hinging on a romanticized destiny...check, a love interest...check, a nemesis...check, the bad guys have a secret weapon....check. More bewildering is the praise of feminism that has elevated the film to greater acclaim than it deserves. This is nonsense. The hero is a heroine; that is pretty much it. Gadot has enough conviction to command the screen but she is not a great actress, Fortunately she doesn't need to be. The script doesn't give her much of an inner life. In particular, her romance with Steve Trevor is fairly staged and seldom organic. Her claim to understand the power of human love by the end of the movie is no more earnest than Trump's claim to understanding the problems of America.Wonder Woman is unusual in its structure. It has an enjoyable middle section bookended by a fairy cheesy first and third act. Diana leaves her home in the over green screened Amazon world and enters WWII Europe with Steve Trevor. The film handles her displacement in the real world with some good humour before allowing her to shine on the front lines of the battle. The action scene are fine, although there are a few too many kicks and punches in slow motion. Watching this effect in 21st century cinema is like watching a sporting gear commercial. The climax is disappointing because it is dull. Diana exchanges gimmicky banner with her nemesis Ares while engaging it a relatively lifeless fireball fight.The movie succeeds in making you want to see more of Gadot in the hope that maybe a sequel will have more imagination in the writing. However, that seems unlikely.","4 out of 10 found this helpful.

I was expecting a lightweight popcorn action movie, where I could just shut off my brain and enjoy some PG13 action...Now there are many issues with this movie.
The special effects are questionable at best, considering this is supposed to be a blockbuster movie.
The story is about as flat as the Bolivian salt flats.But what actually restarted my brain into working condition was the depicition of the german (soldiers) people...
I am german. And I felt ptiy for the people that actually think this movie describes germans as we are or were at the time!Germans are portraied as stupid, cruel, heartless and incredibly violent people.
Now, as this theme has been apparent in many movies since the second world war. (Germans usually are portraied as either stupid and/or ruthless in their efforts)
This movie was so much over the top. It was a propaganda show par excellence, that made my blood boil red hot in anger.
I am not a german nationalist. I see myself as a European, who wants all of Europe (and I also would refer to Russa as a European state, as about 80% of the Russian people actually live in Europe) to live in peace and to aim for a common goal of unity and prosperity. 
But this movie acutually makes me hate America and its views of German people, German heritage and German behaviour toward others.The people who made this should be ashamed of themselves for creating such a pile of garbage!","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

I came into this movie expecting the worst, but I was definitely surprised. Is Wonder Woman one of the best superhero movies ever made? No way. But I do think this is the best DC movie since The Dark Knight Rises (which I know isn't saying much), and I think I have a tiny bit more faith in upcoming DC movies now.I'll start off with my biggest complaints. Everything that happens until Wonder Woman and Steve leave the island is terrible...it's full of bad acting, clich√©s, and awful CGI. This movie can be so cheesy and so clich√© sometimes, and it's not self aware of it. Some scenes that are meant to be dramatic come off as laughable. The movie's tone is very inconsistent, and again, it's unaware. There's some pretty bad green scene too. Most characters besides Wonder Woman and Steve are either uninteresting and/or annoying. The soundtrack can also be repetitive. This movie also has like three villains for some reason, the main one being so underdeveloped and forgettable. Some elements of the story are very predictable too, and the climax of the movie is so horrendously awful. From the cringe-worthy one liners to the goofy effects, I was just waiting for the movie to end from that point. Basically when the main villain is introduced (which is like 20 minutes before the end of the movie) the movie becomes 10 times worse.I don't want the cons to turn you off though, because I'd still recommend this to action/superhero movie fans. There's actually a lot of good humor in this movie that's a refreshing take from the previous entries in this universe. This movie felt like a breed between the first Captain America movie and the first Thor movie, although I like Wonder Woman better than both of those. The action in this movie is also pretty intense and riveting, minus the climax. The movie really nails the WWI setting as well. I liked the banter between Wonder Woman and Steve too, the chemistry between them was there. I was unsure if Gal Gadot was a good Wonder Woman when I saw her in BvS, but I now see that she's a great choice. She's very funny and charming, and not a wooden, thrown-in prop like she is in BvS.I wouldn't go into this movie expecting a 10/10 rating, because this movie has a lot of flaws. The 96% you're seeing on Rotten Tomatoes and other critic sites are a lie. If you can suspend your disbelief for a bit and accept it for a cheesy superhero movie, then you'll like it. I enjoyed it so much more than the previous entries in this universe that it gives me a small bit of hope in the future of DC, even though we deserve better than this.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

So I was not easily won over, but her appearance is great and she really shines. But she can not save the movie, which has too plain a story, non engaging characters - and the whole thing has a taste of cheap propaganda. US American propaganda that is. The US soldiers are fighting the good fight against evil Nazis, the bullets are flying, explosions everywhere and our American super woman is leading from the front taking all the heat reflecting it with her superpowers. << be a superhero too - join the army >> .. and forget, that the US is acting today like the Nazis did in the 30th. A Israeli superzionazi heroin is just what is needed making it to work. The CGi is unrealistic, the story shallow and is a nice enough film for 10 year old kids with the bonus of a female superhero. If you did not had a lobotomy stay away or fast forward the cheesy dialogues - plenty of them - and enjoy the few action scenes with poor CGI.Her infight scenes are not exactly martial art but rely too heavy on CGI I really enjoyed the first minutes though, when superwoman as a kid wanted to learn fighting, the rest I think not.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

I rarely had the chance to see such a (really) bad movie. I felt dismayed, even though I understood the logic that led to this grotesque result: 1) With more and more countries as a target audience, scripts now need to worry, even more, about not displeasing anyone - Chinese, Russians, Brazilians, Germans or Indians - which makes large productions increasingly ""lukewarm"" and tasteless; 2) Being created already thinking of innumerable sequences - which, however, need to be able to be assisted independently, because the studios do not pretend to sell part 2 only for those who watched the first part, nor part 5 only for those who already watched the Parts 1, 2, 3 and 4) - the films can not be either original or even realistic or deep (which would generate issues and complications that would not allow to watch part 6 without having previously seen part 3, for example).But, by itself, none of this explains the sad experience of watching Wonder Woman. I already went to the cinema aware of this limitations, but was waiting for at least some quality. I am easy to please, with a well thought out script (I knew it would not be the case), with original or well-executed visual effects (not even that are in this movie!), good performances, or even a good soundtrack. Unfortunately Wonder Woman does not deliver any of this.Is a complete waste of time and money.And, being clear, it is not feminist at all.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

The film starts with Diana (Lilly Aspell) living on an idyllic Greek looking island. We don't know where or what time period she grows up in (and it seems like she is the only one who does grow up), honing her skills and learning huge amounts, but suddenly the First World War arrives on her doorstep, in the shape of Chris Pine as Steve Trevor and changes her life. Following on from Dawn of Justice - and lets face it, pretty much everyone knows the Batman and Superman back stories - it makes sense to have an origin story for Wonder Woman for those who don't know who she is (and it would have been good to have an Aquaman (2018) and Cyborg (2020!!!!) film before the Justice League film, but ho-hum).
Yet, considering scale of the backdrop of WW1, the camera spends an inordinate amount of time looking straight at Dianas face when they could have spent more time on the plot. DC seem to love these pretentious posing shots, evident through out all the recent films, when they could go back to the Christian Bale style Batman style, or even the Michael Keaton era that at least has some humour and engaging plots.The supporting cast carry the main character, but could have done with more screen time. Connie Nielsen (Hippolyta) and Robin Wright (Antiope) have such presence on the screen as sword wielding, Amazonian warriors and balance nicely with the Lucy Davis (Etta), as a feisty London secretary, and Elena Anaya (Dr. Maru) as a sadistic chemical expert. All these women play pivotal roles in the film and I wish they'd had more lines.Sadly, Sa√Ød Taghmaoui (Sameer), Ewen Bremner(Charlie) and Eugene Brave Rock (The Chief) I think could have been used better; seemingly deep characters with a similar camaraderie as Marvels Howling Commandos, yet they're more played as foils to help Diana better understand the ""world of men"". You can't miss that you have a native American working with an American on a mission to stop a group of people who've invaded another nation. Looking at DC's list of future films, it looks like Diana Prince will be around for a few years to come, and maybe we'll get some more flash backs to better expand on this wonderful character.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The main character - wonder woman - is completely unlikeable as she's pretty much the most arrogant person you can imagine and the only thing she ever learns is at the end of the movie. She's basically just a cute face - which everybody around her constantly acknowledges - and kicks around and kills people.Why are the Germans the cartoon villains?? This is the 1st world war, there ARE NO Nazis. Yes, there was poison gas and all that stuff but you'd think the Germans were Nazis all along when you watch this piece of crap. There's no suspense because you don't care about the characters.I want to like the DC movies. I honestly do. But most of the time it's just plain boring to watch the action since they don't get how to introduce characters and make them likable. What has dear wonder woman ever done, EVER, to deserve her power and station? Train for a bit.Gonna stop ranting now. I wanted to stop mid-movie because I and my girlfriend were both bored. Should have done that.","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

The Amazones' purpose wasn't to save the world, if anything their main concern of life was war. Second of all Diana is the Roman version of the Goddess of Hunt and the Moon. And she has nothing to do with the Amazones, the only correct thing about Diana is that she is a daughter of Zeus.The Ares went rogue thingy: It doesn't make sense, if there would be one God who would want to overthrow the rule of the Gods it would be Hades. Also Ares didn't hate the humans, he loved them. Humans even worshiped him, and prayed to him whenever they went to war. oh also: GODS CANNOT DIE. Did you know that Poseidon, Hades, Hestia, Hera and Demeter spent their first years of life in the stomach of their father Cronos. Finally, Since when does Ares look like an English little prick and not like a blond firm Greek God?","5 out of 16 found this helpful.

I mean they were all positive. Then I looked again today after seeing it for the first time and saw more negative reviews than positive. So it's interesting...How am I to rate this? People will hate this analogy but It's very similar to the first Captain America movie. Similar time frame, similar story-line, bad guys, etc. I half expected them to bump into each other somewhere in the movie, lol...Gal is very pretty, and that never hurts, but overall I found the entire plot a little flat. The ""bad guy"" & end fight, while it had a couple moments wasn't anything to be remembered. Heck Batman vs. Superman had a much more exciting end fight sequence than this. But I suppose this being the origin movie, you can't have the pony outrace the horse I guess.In the end, I'm glad I didn't pay to see it, and if I had after reading the overwhelmingly positive reviews I probably would have left disappointed. It's not a bad movie, but just nothing that really wow'ed me. But that was similar to the first Cap movie like I mentioned before. It kind of set the stage I guess you could say and gave her the backstory which is what they intended","4 out of 12 found this helpful.

I thought it was a fun popcorn muncher. The opening scene of Diana's Amazonian roots and the weird battle with Germans who just happen to accidentally find their way through some sort of portal...is just not that compelling. All these women who train all their lives to be these mystical warriors, doing flips and jumps...are no match for a bullet? I suppose they are supposed to be normal human women who can just leap 20 feet? It doesn't make much sense. You have to wait almost an hour for the first good action scene, which is quite thrilling with Diana charging the world war 1 trenches. But it takes sooo long to get there. The villain is forgettable and clich√©. The German bad guys are a clich√© of Nazis, and what's with all the weird identity politics, like the Native American guy ""He took my land,"" who adds nothing to the plot, or the weird German sniper who does nothing?Anyway, I didn't hate it, didn't love it.

When everyone is telling her not to rush in blindly and she does so anyway, it all works out and she was right all along. All those people were just being callous or cowardly for not rushing in to help every innocent they saw. I don't want to put a spoiler tag so I'll avoid specifics, but I just found this insulting, both to my own intelligence as a viewer and especially to the millions of men who died in the Great War. Historical accuracy is hardly that important for a superhero movie, so this is not a huge deal, but I have to ask, why General Ludendorff? He's a pretty significant historical figure after the war ends, playing a pretty central role in Hitler's rise to power. Maybe using him was not the smartest move given what they did with him, particularly as it was a completely unnecessary choice. Apart from Dianna's issues above (basically the entirety of the story) the film itself was...OK. The action was good, the acting was pretty good all around. Gal Gadot did a great job showing a mix of innocence and righteousness. David Thewlis as always was fantastic in his ability to go from utter calm civility to raging intensity in no time flat. Costume design was pretty good, and the soundtrack was awesome. Bottom line: if you're only watching this movie to see an awesome Wonder Woman kick ass, you'll love it. If you are looking for a story that makes any kind of sense, shows any kind of character growth, and encourages a morality beyond that of a 6-year-old, don't watch this movie.","3 out of 8 found this helpful.

Well, not all of us, not anymore. It takes some time, and some really uncomfortable thinking, to realize it. But once you do, you are a free man, or woman, or whatever, and it feels goood!I'm talking about the ""film industry"", maybe we should call it ""propaganda industrial conglomerate"" borrowing words from one of the US presidents, only that he was referring to the actual war machine, the one that keeps piercing bodies with bullets since over a century ago.This movie is part of the latest wave of war-something films. These come in all kinds of flavors: ape-wars, superhero-civil-wars, actual wars, wars against aliens, etc. One of my favorite ones is the Greeks against the Persians, guess who are the ""bad guys"". There is also the Spartan wars, in which the metaphor is that the ancient city-state was the cradle of a bodybuilding civilization to which we owe the survival of ours. Hopefully, we are not relying on the obesity civilization to guarantee our continuity, but they certainly spit video material at awesome speed.Wonder Woman was once a little innocent girl living in a paradise island inhabited by more women who constantly train in makeshift hand to hand combat. Like Spartans do, only the girls wear more clothes. Blood is seldom drawn, the metaphor doesn't need it. They are warriors descending from the gods, speak English with some accents, have American body language, etc, etc, I'll spare you the rest. If you go watch this movie, you are not reading this ""review"".Yeah, ""review"" between marks because I had to stop, I had to click on the pause and destroy icon. Time is precious, and there is nothing in this movie that deserves my precious seconds, or yours. Or, perhaps, if you are still not convinced that big budget movies are scripted by big budget people, you should sit through this one with a critical mind.","5 out of 17 found this helpful.

For the first 1 hour, pretty much nothing happens. In the second 1 hour, there are some fireworks, but they cannot compensate for the complete lack of intrigue, the amazingly slow pace, the flat characters and for the completely boring villain. Somebody said it's a rip off of Captain America, but I still cannot decide which one is worst. Maybe both are. I remember the main critics towards Jupiter Ascending was that the female character was weak. If Wonder Woman is a strong female character, I'm speechless. Because it's arguable that WW was even the main character of this movie, to me she looked more like a pretty background face. Anyway, I highly recommend people not to watch this movie.

I hate fantasy genre. Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and everything that comic con nerd culture celebrates. And I am the one who is still single at 35, mind you. But hey, are the nerds so deprived nowadays so as to sell their soul just to watch a femme fatale in a movie with zero suspense?I asked my cousin if it is indeed for comic con nerds or great movie in general. He said the latter. But the thing is I should've listened to my kombucha infused probiotic gut. I mean if I don't like fantasy, then I shouldn't watch fantasy. It doesn't matter if it gets 'rave reviews' or trumpeted by spineless herd, tribe and sheep mentality who will blindly follow the bandwagon effect and swallow anything that 'others' tell them it is good for them.Hence, the mea culpa part. This is why I avoid Stephen King and reading mainstream books like JK Rowling's ones and avoid A Game of the Thrones.But the thing is the intro was pretty cool and got me hooked. But pretty soon it devolved into cringe worthy fantasy scenes. I was hoping against hope that it will get better in Dark Knightesque fashion.Boy.

I went as far as the boat scene where Diana is about to leave...But I'd rather not; even though I wasted one preworkout drink.Moral of the story? Mainstream media bias will do anything in its power to trumpet any unpalatable content along with mass advertising powerhouses.RIP objectivity. RIP neutrality. RIP class, content and intellect.This is why people likes Danielle Steele and squirms at Pynchon. So lesson learned: ""Never ever get swayed by popular opinion. Stay true to your heart. And even if 6,999,999,999 of the populace says something is 'a masterpiece' or 'out of the park' and if YOU feel it is worthless, pile of cow dung... value your opinion. ""Ultimately your opinion matters too no matter how much it goes against the grain.""p.s. I know I haven't touched on the content, but let's face it...there isn't a content at all. Just a depiction of a fantasy land with woman in miniskirts and thighs apparently doing Scythian horsemanship and shooting arrows.

It reminded me a lot of Batman vs Superman (2016). That flick was also way too long and did had a rare story.I enjoyed Wonder Woman when the story was told were she grew up. Guess it took the first 20 minutes but suddenly a man comes ashore and he's the first man they ever saw but not only that and from there it's downhill, he brings war with him. So off goes Wonder Woman to help the soldier in WWI. Really? The effects were good but that doesn't make a flick especially with superheroes. And the fact that love also takes a whole bite throughout Wonder Woman. No, for me this was a disappointment. A bit like Suicide Squad (2016), You've seen the trailers and it all looks stunning until you sit back and watch the movie.

But in my opinion it's not really feminist, it's only less sexist than the average Hollywood film. The female protagonist is a very pretty young woman, she is a warrior, but she doesn't look at all like a warrior, she's not the skinny model type, but she's too slender if compared to real life martial arts or top sportswomen, no broad shoulders, no visible arm muscles. During the film she was fighting a lot, but her face remained mainly relaxed with the lips a bit open to look sexy. A male fighter would frown, grind the teeth and spit like fighters and top athletes of both sexes do when in action. When she met people for the first time, mainly males, they would get impressed by her beauty first, so she's still a object woman. Her shoes had heels, not really handy for martial arts. The age gap between her and the male is OK, 5 years, something not common in Hollywood where most women are mainly almost 1 generation younger than men. She was too easily seduced by the first male she saw. She was frequently interrupted or given orders by the male and mostly she was OK with that. A really feminist woman would not accept a man to be giving her orders. When she sees a baby for the first time she's delighted and wants to touch it, mother instinct stereotype. At least in the beginning of the films some older women were also in the scene.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

I could not believe how absolutely terrible it is. The only movie based on a comic book or superhero that is worse than this is Batman v Superman. This is a close second to how bad that movie is, which is really saying something as that movie completely destroyed both Batman and Superman and made them into something neither of them are. Clearly all the hype for Wonder Woman is purely manufactured in order to attempt to save DC comics movies from total failure. However, after this, I don't have much hope left for them. Which is sad as I really hoped they could turn their movies around and finally produce something good.The script is a complete rip off of the Captain America movie, with zero deviation from the overall plot, that you have to wonder if they're just going to start copying Marvel.

""I want to fight!""
""You can't! It's too dangerous! You don't know the truth!""
Come the climax, there are few (if any) surprises left.The action sequences are few and far between, damp squibs that attempt to compensate with excessive use of slo-mo (revealing Zack Snyder's firm hand in the production).The movie riffs too heavily on Marvel's better efforts - god-like fish out of water (Thor)? Check. Hidden island of peace (Black Panther)? Check. Shield-wielding war setting (Captain America)? Check.It's a female empowerment movie that still feels the need to give the protagonist a white, all-American love interest. Bizarre.Overall, Wonder Woman is at least 20 minutes too long (like all superhero movies these days), deathly dull for the most part and confused in its message.

While it should by no means be taken seriously, the Wonder Woman movie provides some solid entertainment. It has some nice cinematic visuals, thrilling battles, a few laughs, and a moment or two of true emotion. Chris Pine plays a fantastic role - arguably the best of the film. The supporting characters are likeable and well-portrayed. I was particularly impressed with the writer's use of little-known biblical parallel. Despite several tongue-in-cheek moments and minor ""fail""s, I quite enjoyed the movie.However, a movie is only as good as its star, since even a great character can fail to convince viewers if his/her actor lacks talent. Gadot was a very, very poor choice for the role of Wonder Woman. Firstly, she is not an actress, but is actually a beauty pageant contestant. Secondly, her ethnicity, eye colour, build, and general appearance differ too greatly from the comicbook character she was chosen to portray. Thirdly - and most importantly - she has absolutely no acting ability. Her repertoire consists of two basic facial expressions and the movements of a fashion model. In the role of a warrior, she is laughably lacking in stature, physical strength, agility, and fluidity of motion. In the role of /any/ character with a heart, she is painfully devoid of emotion. She was chosen for her pageant looks and nothing more, and that fact is clear throughout the film.Had a different ""actress"" been chosen for the starring role, Wonder Woman could have stood alongside the Avengers, Batman, and X-Men movies. Unfortunately, we're stuck with Gadot, and so any future Wonder Woman flicks are doomed to mediocrity.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I believe she has great potential and will exceed far past people's expectations. However if I were to be frank, Gal Gadot did not fit the role of Wonder Women. And I'd like to think that this was not her fault but the fault of the script writers and perhaps even the cast directors. Granted Patty Jenkins, the director, initially was not sure about Gal Gadot's casting as Wonder Woman but she eventually gave in and acclaimed her for her work....I'm not sure if I can say the same. If the script writers gave her less dialogue and more motion acting, would've portrayed Wonder Woman as an even more powerful and respected woman. Think about it, a woman who knows that she is powerful does not need to talk much, the people around her treats her as such. ROBIN WRIGHT should have been Wonder Woman and I say this because she portrayed all the characteristics of what we all thought Wonder Woman would be like. Her attitude, her attributes, the way how her mental toughness and aggressiveness plays into her character all tied with empowering women probably more than Gal Gadot (just being frank, i still love Gal Galdot).I have a pretty good feeling that DC was trying to play catch-up in producing good films against Marvel. This is probably where they really messed up. After DC got wind of the Justice League movie they decided to rush these films (which had such great potential) and ultimately produced a very poor story line with awkward script writing resulting in a confusing, non-impactful film. More money was spent on CGI than the actual build of the story line and I am so taken aback by how little was done for the story of Wonder Woman. Either Snyder was high, was preoccupied with something else or he was just having a bad year. WONDER WOMAN is too goddamn powerful/enemies don't know how to shoot her at the legs/poison gas is weak sauce. I mean think about this for a second, when Christopher Nolan created the Batman series we all expected him to follow corny CGI action scenes, follow the footsteps of previous Batman films, similar script writing as previous films, etc. But he blew us out of the water by creating a film that took on a WHOLE NEW perspective of Bruce Wayne's life. The movie was so artistic not just through the sequence of actions scenes but more so the plot of the story. It encapsulated the audience by allowing the main character to be more human than hero so that we'd be able to see ourselves in him (Bruce Wayne). Which is why in the end we end up rooting for Bruce Wayne after the turmoil he had to endure and all the training he had to go through. Nolan took it upon himself to create a serious movie, his goal was to create a Batman film that everyone would respect and take seriously. Now I'm not saying that everyone is a Nolan, but I am saying that if the industry were to take into consideration of what Nolan did or took the time to produce a more enriched story line Wonder Woman would be a far greater film. The movie had such great potential and it's sad to see such a film follow the cliche standards of what a hero movie is supposed to be like on top of the really bad dialogues/story line. Again my assumption is that they rushed this film to be produced against Marvel movies which is why this film was less artistic and more like it was trying to copy a kids cartoon version of Wonder Woman. How I would've cast the members:
Wonder Woman - ROBIN WRIGHT, Angelina Jolie or Zoe Saldana
Steve Trevor - Tom Hardy or Joel Edgerton
Ludendorff - Tom Hiddleston or Hugo Weaving or Rufus SewellWriters: Bob Kane, David S. Goyer, Gavin O'Connor, Anthony Tambakis, Kurt Johnstad, Jane Goldman, Matthew Vaughn","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I was told by multiple people to go watch this movie. I did. That was a mistake. Effects/Visuals - The effects are all really bad. The CG is really bad. There is a really bad shot of Wonder Woman jumping in front of a greenscreen that the director loved so much that the shot is reused at the very end with a different background. Some of the set design is decent but its ruined by bad CG. Whenever they aren't filming on location, its just really bad and obvious greenscreens. There's a few hilarious editing mistakes towards the middle of this movie. Some of these points don't sound too bad until you consider the budget of this movie. Audio - The music is terrible and clashes with what's happening onscreen. Not only does it rarely fit the mood, it also doesn't fit the time period, but I don't think anyone in production cared about that. Characters - There's a lot of bad acting. The actors aren't given very good direction, and the result is a mess. The only thing that is even kinda believable is the love story. The villain is absolutely terrible. Wonder Woman doesn't really have much of a character. Most of the characters are stupid both in intelligence and in concept alone. Everything is dumbed down to the point where its full of plot holes. The Plot - Cliche and predictable. Most of the ""twists"" that are in the movie are just things that the audience usually already knows when they come in to watch this movie. The only thing that you could genuinely claim to not see coming is the reveal of WHO the villain really is. Mostly because the villain subplot is massive mess. The Action - The action is terrible. Its poorly shot and makes no sense. The action scenes would only work in a comedy.The History - This story takes place in WW1 but the Germans act like Nazis. I'm not an expert on WW1 Europe, but I'm pretty sure were a lot more errors. Also the Germans speak English throughout the movie. There isn't really anything that this movie does well. There are like 2 or 3 kinda fun scenes but most of it is just boring and nonsensical.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"1","/10","Mediocre superhero film with a miscast star","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4011547/?ref_=tt_urv","texasboyy","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur81530953/?ref_=tt_urv","23 December 2017","An overall mediocre movie made by-the-numbers by an unqualified director who only has one low budget film credit on her resume she made 14 years ago. Only reason I can figure why they chose her is that she was the cheapest out of a list of female directors. I could name off more qualified female directors in my sleep. And Warner Brothers obviously had little faith in her because they only signed her for one movie, and that almost never happens.The movie is made even worse by a totally miscast Gal Gadot. Not only is she a horrible actress, she also doesn't fit the massive popular perception of what Wonder Woman - the world's greatest female hero and a demi-goddess - should look like. Gadot is just a generic pretty face floating on top of a heavily-padded costume to (literally) fill the role. I never bought her as WW - or an actress - for a moment.I'm a huge fan of female superheroes, especially Wonder Woman, but she is the total opposite of that character. It's like casting PeeWee Herman to play Superman or when they miscast short, skinny Michael Keaton to play Batman. Even director Patty Jenkins admitted in an interview that she never would have picked Gadot if Snyder hadn't already cast her for Batman v Superman (and Snyder never explained why he chose her over so many other better options out there).I'm already looking forward to the next reboot and recasting. It took DC/WB 25 years to finally get Batman right on the big screen with Affleck. Hopefully it won't take that long with WW.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

"5","/10","A very nice central character, but surrounded by a mess of a story","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6235389/?ref_=tt_urv","davidmvining","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur110212703/?ref_=tt_urv","4 November 2020","I know that the general consensus is that Patty Jenkins' Wonder Woman righted the DCEU ship, but for the faults of the previous film, I don't think that was really a way to make it better. It's brighter, more colorful, with a more upbeat central character, for sure, several things I have no problem with whatsoever, but there are sections of this film that I find poorly done and even thematically confused. It's really a mixed bag of a solo adventure for the Amazon.My problems with the film really start at the very beginning. You see, I kind of hate everything about Themyscira, the hidden island of the Amazons. The production design, in particular the costumes, are too monotonous. The awkward accents everyone has to adopt because Gal Gadot couldn't completely rid herself of her own are a bane on every line of dialogue. The biggest problem ends up being the action sequence that introduces Steve Trevor. The American pilot/spy working for British intelligence is fleeing the Germans after he stole the notebook of Dr. Poison that details her newest deadly gas weapon. Diana gets Steve to shore, and the Germans attack.Now, the Amazons have been established as the best fighters who train hard endlessly without any actual opponents for thousands of years. The second the Germans show up with guns, they wreck the Amazons, but this being a movie, logic doesn't follow through and the warriors on horseback with spears and bows end up beating the organized soldiers with rifles. Fine, I can deal with it. I would normally just call it a nitpick, but the problems compound with later events. Skipping ahead, Steve gets Diana to the front line trenches in France. As they get closer, Diana is looking at the dead and wounded and wanting to do everything she can to stop the group's progress to help them like this is the first time she's seen the actual effects of war, except she's already seen them and they involved her friends and family. Her mentor died in her arms, for Pete's sake. Ultimately, everything on Themyscira feels wrong, and that's a solid thirty minute start to the film.Once Steve gets Diana off Themyscira, things pick up. The early banter between the two feels a bit forced but gets progressively better as the movie develops. The fish out of water stuff with Diana in 1916 London is silly and entertaining on a thin level. Diana's textbook and almost childlike understanding of the practical realities of war gives her a do-goodism that feels refreshing in the World War I aesthetic. The group of soldiers that Steve finds to go to the continent are distinctive individually and entertaining. It's solid stuff. Diana standing up from the trenches to charge across No Man's Land is a wonderful visual moment, but my problems start picking up again.This would be another nitpick, but after the collapse of the beach battle at Themyscira, it builds up. The stakes and objective of the action across No Man's Land become fuzzy at best. It ends up that Diana is going to reach a small town on the other side of the German lines, but the geography from the German line to the town is unclear, especially when you throw in the poor French woman begging for help compounded with Steve's assertion that the trenches haven't moved in a year. Then once they get to the town, the actual objective of this fight is, well, fuzzy. Where are the troops they're fighting? Where's their command center? What are the grounds for victory? The movie never really answers these and the fight kind of just stops after Diana gets the last guy who happens to be a sniper in a church steeple. The action itself is well filmed (much better than the cut up nonsense that was the beach battle), but the objectives are just really unclear so that when the battle ends it's unclear that it's actually the end.Now, to talk about the antagonists. There are three, and I hate two of them. There's General Ludendorff (Danny Huston) who is just the most generic scenery chewing villain. There's Doctor Poison (Elena Anaya) with a cool three piece facemask who is dedicated to her research and feels unappreciated (I really like her). And then there's Ares (David Thewlis) who turns into a CGI scenery chewing villain. Both Ludendorff and Ares are awful antagonists. Thin and more about playing to the rafters than anything else, though Ares should have been the kind of interesting antagonist who could potentially tempt Diana onto his side, but he just devolves into nonsense by the end.So, Diana herself has the makings of having a great and emotionally mature arc, but the movie screws with it so completely that it ultimately devolves into nonsense, mostly because of Ares. The idea seems to be that Diana has no understanding of war and men, gets a lesson in the brutality of war and men, and ultimately turns away from the world because of it. That seems purposefully piggybacked on the plot mechanics of Diana going into the Great War with the objective of finding Ares in human form and killing him, ending the evil in men's hearts and stopping the war. She's convinced that Ludendorff is Ares and ultimately kills him only to find that the war didn't just stop. It kept going.That would have been, well, that would have been an absolutely fantastic place to end Diana. She walks away, convinced that man isn't worth saving or something. But that's not the kind ending you can have in your big budget comic book movie, so they turn around and make Ares real, manifesting right after next to Diana in the form of a physically weak British diplomat who had been working towards armistice. His efforts at an armistice are brushed away unconvincingly in a single line of dialogue and then he becomes CGI monster man who yells a lot. This is disappointing but what makes the ending confused is what Diana goes through. She ends up defending mankind as worthwhile anyway despite Ares' proof that they made the war themselves, she defeats him in borderline incomprehensible CGI, and then she decides to turn her back on humanity because Steve sacrificed himself to end the poison gas threat. I'm sorry, but this is nonsense. None of it makes a lick of sense. Diana shouldn't suddenly defend humanity after she realizes that they made the war themselves after a lifetime of thinking that Ares was the source of all man's cruelty. She shouldn't see the selfless act of Steve as a reason to turn her back on humanity. It's a mishmash of nonsense to end the film, and I kind of hate it.I don't hate the movie as a whole, for sure. It's lightly entertaining for long stretches. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine develop really good chemistry to the point where Steve's goodbye to Diana ends up feeling quite genuine and affecting. It often looks very good, embracing speed ramping and slow motion far more than Zack Snyder ever did for his Superman movies despite having popularized the technique in 300. What this movie is not is particularly intelligent thematically, nor does it know how to create and effectively use any antagonists (its best, Doctor Poison, gets sidelined for most of the runtime). I sort of understand the affection people have for it, but I definitely don't share it.","2 out of 5 found this helpful.

I am a fan of Gal Gadot and Chris Pine so was optimistic. This is an average if not below average movie.

The Villains aren't very believable or scary, and in the end you lose all caring for the main characters. So what you are left with is two hours that you hope would just go as quickly as possible to end this drudge as you slowly choke on your popcorn and watch people leave the cinema.I'm not sure what they were trying to achieve but I think they missed the mark by a massive scale, unless the only purpose of this movie was to make money, which obviously it has done that, but I for one will not be running out to see the next. And before people start claiming that I'm not a fan of these sorts of movies, I am not only a fan but a former comic book collector from childhood and I absolutely love all the Marvel movies so far, I'm even a fan of the last Batman V Superman movie.There are some great movies out there, this really isn't one of them.

But where the director REALLY took a stumble was during the midpoint, where this action flick suddenly took an unexpected (and fatal) 180-degree change of pace, attempting to build on the love affair between the principals by inserting a useless ""serious"" moment in the play that only succeeded in unnecessarily slowing the film's genre pace to a bizarre exposition of supposed ""seriousness"" where it had no business being at all.

After hearing a lot of praise that this film is ""great"" and gets the whole feminism thing ""right"", I was excited to check it out. Sadly, it's one of the worst films I've seen this year. and does little -if anything- to level the playing field for women in superhero films.Honestly, this was tough to sit through. The first half hour is mainly the origin story, but it's suffers from bad storytelling, direction and effects. I never once bought into any of it. Nothing was properly explained, and then suddenly the plot started with no explanation as to how. Then, it's too late, and the audience is stuck trying to decide whether or not to stick it out or bolt for the door. I should have chose the door!By the end, I was lucky to be awake. So this is what passes for a 7.4 on IMDb these days? Maybe I should return to obsessively watching classic directors instead of trying to keep up with Hollywood?

Not exactly what I would envision aesthetically as the ideal choice for the part, but she's a good enough contrast to the seemingly clueless male co-stars. The beginning of the movie is quite lovely. Kudos to those responsible for picking out all the amazing backdrops, which distract you from the twisted plot. Great casting for Queen Hippolyta and Thia Eva (the Amazonian general), but some of the other Amazonians were also a bit much. They're stronger and more physically adept than any other women in the world. We get it.I'm not a fan of everyone's treatment of Diana in general. Without offering any serious spoilers, her character is always viewed as ""distracting"" at various levels both on and off the island. The only way she gets attention is by being ""loud Greek girl"" or just ignoring everyone and jumping into the fray without a clue. The greatest possible weapon she could have -- full disclosure of who and what she really is -- is never offered to her. In truth, the back story of why she exists is a huge departure from the comic tale AND also an insult to the Amazonian myth that is being used as the backdrop of the story. Did Disney buy out DC Comics too?Chris Pine is eye candy, as always, but the constant references to how spectacular a physical specimen he is (as part of countless plots in ALL his films) is getting old. Is it something he insists on having his his contracts? If not, it's too Tom Jones. Give him a new line, someone. PLEASE. He's actually a good actor otherwise.Next, the only characters throughout the movie who have a positive view of strong/intellectual women are highlighted as ""the bad guys"" in major ways, which was very upsetting.In short, it's not a proper Wonder Woman film and goes against the most fundamental precepts behind the creation of the character.There ARE some humorous moments in the movie, including some of Diana's cluelessness about men and the modern world, but the joke is taken a little too far.One of the funniest scenes is actually when she's dead serious and clad in blue. No spoilers, but she reminded me of every Greek mom I know in that one moment. Well done, Gadot.","3 out of 10 found this helpful.

The fact it's made so much money shows that poorly made teenager centric films obviously have a huge audience.The script is shockingly clich√©d and poorly written with many characters that wouldn't be out of place in a below average Video Game ie terrible. Maybe that's intentional as many scenes resemble the cut-scenes in a video game, especially the ""bad guy's"" scenes. That bodes badly for the future of cinema. The acting follows suit.Surprisingly for the budget, too many effects look fake and cheesy. Even the large city crowds fail to convince it's real.As for the fight choreography, it's American so expect more edits than punches. Except of course when it's full CGI complete with slow-mo. When will directors and editors learn!It's not all bad. There are the usual cgi influenced battles, which obviously talented people have worked on. They must however feel disappointed when the see their work in the completed movie.I love decent action films, unfortunately this isn't close to decent. Slow, clich√©d, horrible 'comic relief' and mainly poor action with zero excitement. However, males who've just hit puberty will probably love it.

Ottomans helping German's to build chemical weapons was a complete bullshit ww2 propaganda for typical lowly educated English speaking masses, with the context of ww1. When you check the facts you will see, actually, Turks got hit by Italians chemical bombs. Then the widest and mass usage of chemical weapons was British using it against Russian Bolsheviks. Furthermore, there was no plan or what so ever like preparing an attack with chemical weapons to hit allied forces, especially from German's nor the Turks. This is purely designed for those typical Trumpians, and you know Bible readers. Let's get to secondary issues such as how would the most gullible character of DC comics come alive. Why would cheap action figures exist in the movie? You know when you spend quite a lot of money into a production like this, you would want the CGI stuff to look professional rather than cheap. But there are many scenes that you can pick. Deflecting bullets with those arm protectors, not cool at the very least. You know it's not the arm protector, its the design of the scenes, you can do it once, twice, but man, in every scene deflecting bullets like you wipe some sweat from your forehead.

But for myself I much prefer what Lynda Carter did in the 70s on the small screen.I'm not even sure comic book purists will not have criticisms because this one takes Wonder Woman back to World War I. As we know she was created just before our entry into that second World War and her reason for leaving the Paradise Island home was to offer her services to the Allies most specifically against Mr. Hitler.In this one Steve Trevor played by Chris Pine washes ashore on the Amazonian populated Paradise Island and he's followed shortly by some invading Germans. Trevor is played by Chris Pine and he helps battle the invaders. Not without losses do the Amazons repel the Germans, they give a good account of themselves with spears and arrows, on horseback and on foot.Here Princess Diana the soon to be Wonder Woman decides to leave the island because the Greek God of war Ares is behind all the slaughter on the western front. A Deity that gets off on killing. That's who Israeli actress Gal Gadot playing Wonder Woman is after while Chris Pine has a more prosaic intelligence mission.Wonder Woman is a good action/adventure flick with the pyrotechnics fans crave, but I'll take Lynda Carter any old time.","5 out of 21 found this helpful.

Bullets bounce off and tanks are a mere nuisance. God smites him, and he just shrugs it off. This is Wonder Woman the movie, and it's boring.There's no character development, as Wonder Woman is already perfect (unlike in the comics). Supporting characters don't fare much better, and are as stereotypically one-dimensional as a cardboard cutout. Bad Germans are bad. Even the main villain seems somehow empty, existing just for the final fight in slow-motion before credits roll.The writing is generally quite sloppy, and the story is filled with insultingly obvious loopholes. Many scenes seem to be glued on only to look cool, and the character's motivations are not clear beyond the general good vs evil.Visuals rotate between CGI landscapes and power poses during slow- motion ballet fights. Pacing is poor, filled with cuts, and many scenes feel artificially constructed. Instead of feeling impressed I felt like someone was forcing ""cool"" things down my throat.It's ironic that the role model praised by feminists is that of an impervious pretty girl with no personality. We have strong women leads in many movies (Alien, Terminator 2, Nikita, Avatar, Hunger Games) and series (Buffy, Alias, Game of Thrones, Orphan Black, S.H.I.E.L.D.) - and they're forceful, independent and charismatic, but also flawed and *interesting*.","3 out of 11 found this helpful.

There were elements in the story and film that were taken from Xena, Warrior princess and if this film was touted during the Xena days, Lucy Lawless would have smashed it as Wonder Woman.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

But I really don't.I believe that equality between sexes shouldn't even be a question. It should be like oxygen. It's there but it is so normal that people just don't care about it.I despise those who say a person should be less because of his gender or look. That is completely insane.
I support the #MeToo movement because that is a geniune problem in this world. Men having power over women just because of their sexuality. But, there is something I hate even more! People who think of this as an opportunity for stardom and fame.
They don't help the cause they just use their sexuality (the same way as men did and still does) to reach their goals and that is just as insane as people like Weinstein.You don't use your sexuality for anything in your career. You use your talent, your brain, your logic.So when I see another dumb movie about a person with superpowers I won't say anything good about about just because that person happens to be a woman. It doesn't matter. If it's a good movie it will stay as one no matter the gender, skin color. If I don't like the movie I won't change my mind just because instead of seeing Superman do stuff in an illogical and boring movie I see Wonder Woman doing the same thing.So yeah, i am completely for equality. In my life, I don't even talk about it really, because I never understood how it even matters. All people are people. It is so obvious I really don't know how is it possible that we are still having this problem.But, then again, I won't say anything nice about a movie I didn't like just so that I can be politically correct.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Women need genuine, interesting roles as actors and unfortunately Wonder Woman yet again perpetuates this idea that 'strong women' are only respected and believed by those around her if she's stunningly attractive and wearing nothing but a bra and mini skirt. Yes, I have no idea how this was made in 2017 since it feels more like a sort of teenage boys bedroom fantasy from the 1950s.
The whole movie can be summed up by one shot.
Imagine: Wonder Woman climbs up over the trenches into no mans land. With complete ease, perfectly curled hair billowing in the wind, a model pout, she bats away pullets all while keeping her perfect runaway walk going.

I also mentioned that the political stance of the main actress also should have been reason enough for her to be excluded from a role in one of the DC series (if for some reason you did not care that she couldn't act). So, my concerns around the discrimination in Hollywood and censorship across entertainment is proved by the mere fact that my previous review got censored. Good job IMDb!

I like both universes equally - but for very different reasons. This movie is NOT a DC movie. It feels very ... syfy channel with a beefed up budget. The story is so flimsy it's almost unbelievable, the action is VERY ""CGI-cartoony"", the acting is aimed - it seems - at creating ""lovable characters"", but fails miserably. OK we got the American fly-boy, the native Indian, the stumbling and bumbling middle eastern guy, and the crazy jittery Scotchman.... How freaking original! Never seen those characters together before! LOL. The fact that it's the ""always used generic Arab""-guy, Chris Pine (who actually plays Kirk like 70% of the time, only less sure of him self and a bit... emo?)... and to top it off the dude from Trainspotting - only furthers to make this whole movie feel cheap and unoriginal!And Wonder Woman herself... Seriously I love Gal Gadot! She is amazing and probably one of the most beautiful women in the world... Seriously look at her in ""Keeping up with the Joneses"" - no one could pull off that role better! ... So you should take it with all seriousness when I tell you she falls FLAT on her rear end in this role... and let me explain why:1: Her ""hero-shots"" seem too much like ""modeling"". They spent so much time trying to ""show off"" Gal it basically takes over the whole focus of the shots, and in many ways makes them seem laughably staged and unnatural! The CGI doesn't help her here AT ALL! If you want a good example of what I mean - notice her hair in the ""close up hero shots"" ... They CGI'ed it ... it looks REALLY horrible!2: Her accent and line delivery doesn't fit the character. Again I ADORE her as an actress - but she constantly breaks the immersion by feeling unnatural in the role... It's sort of like George Clooneys portrait of Batman... It's not that George is a bad actor - he just feels WRONG in the role. And YES I'm ACTUALLY comparing the two - because the both left me with that ""MAN this movie could have been cool - but something was off""- feeling......... this is already TL:DR ... So I'll stop here - but I could keep going... I keep shaking my head when thinking about it... Seriously guys that CGI .......... SO bad! How this movie is getting an 8/10 rating is crazy... I could make tons of theories as to why this is - but SADLY - non of them is actually about the movie... Calling this a mediocre film of this genre is too being nice in my opinion. It tries really really really ..... really REALLY hard to impress, but it's sort of like a puppy trying to do tricks to get your attention - but then it pees on the carpet in over excitement!","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

The film's strongest point are the characters. Diana and Steve are have fleshed out personalities and world views, and are fun to watch when they engage in mundane conversation. I also enjoyed how unabashedly cheesy some of the other characters were, such as the quirky sidekicks and the absurdly sinister villains. The characters alone would have been enough to earn the film a 6/10 rating, all the film needed to do was have a story that made sense and be competently made from a technical level but the film fails to clear either bar. The cinematography, editing and visual effects are very poor, and make every action scene completely incoherent. The story is riddled with numerous plot holes and inconsistencies, while they aren't obvious during the film are incredibly evident if any thought is given to the story. While I do appreciate the film's attempt at exploring the idea that a black/white morality world view is incompatible with the real world, the grand finale manages to completely contradict this thematic crutch, rendering the story meaningless. I review films based on how good it is rather than how much I liked it. While I liked most of the film, it just wasn't a good movie overall.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Does that say much on its own? Yes, but then you look at the other films and you realize just how much that actually means.Let's start with positives. For a DC movie, I actually cared about the plot and main leads. The other films are so incredibly dull and full of themselves that they forget to make a plot that makes sense. In this one, Chris Pine (Steve) and Gal Gadot (Wonder Woman) have great chemistry and have a good end goal. The plot makes sense and you actually care about the two stars.Sadly, that's where the positives shortly and abruptly end. Everything else ranges from mediocre to terrible. Every actor outside of Gal and Chris ranged from meh to bleh. The best example of this is the supporting cast. The ""meh"" is the actor guy and the Scottish sniper who is haunted by war flashbacks. Those guys do an okay job. The ""bleh"" is the Native American guy, who just does stuff to contribute to the plot with no real rhyme or reason.The villains all suck. Dr. Poison doesn't do much other than be a catalyst for the plot. If you took out... Lutendorf? Lugermorph? Ganondorf? If you took him out, nothing would really change. I really like Ares, but they chose the absolute worst actor they could for the role. I cannot look at this villain and not think ""Hey, it's Remus Lupin!"". Even in the final fight, his mustache is still visible, which ruins the spectacle.All the effects are extremely fake looking. The Lasso of Truth cannot be made to look faker even if you tried. The one fight scene where Wonder Woman actually uses it is the fakest looking thing I've seen in a while. Even basic effects like bad green screen still stick out, like that one scene where young Wonder Woman jumps off a roof, and the green screen is so obvious it hurts the eyes.Ultimately this film does do some good, but most of the other stuff does tend to undermine the good stuff. Mind you, the good stuff is worth the price of admission, just be prepared for other, less good stuff.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

It's freaking Wonder Woman!!!!! I can see the X-Men being controversial, what with being primarily about Civil Rights and equality for minorities...but this is DC Comics.OK, so let me put it this way......I do NOT think that Wonder Woman is the greatest female protagonist in an action movie or sci-fi movies...and I am NOT a misogynist.My ""lack of respect"" of Wonder Woman doesn't stem from a hatred of strong female leads...I just think Sarah Conner (Especially in ""Terminator the Sarah Conner Chronicles"") is the absolute coolest and most bada$$ strong female lead that has ever graced the silver screen or your home television.Not only that, I was livid when it got canceled and, for the cherry on top, if you want a strong female role model...have one with the cold soldier discipline and the willingness to sacrifice her life for the mission that Sarah Conner has.Not only that, but to be further controversial, I don't believe that Wonder Woman is the first awesome strong female lead in an action movie. I mean, Ellen Ripely is almost as pure awesome as Sarah Conner...and who can forget Buffy, OK Buffy is touchy, when I mention her I am talking about Buffy from the TV show, not Buffy from the movie.Those are only to name a few. And then there are lesser ones that we hate yet still came before Wonder Woman....most recently the Ghost Busters and Mary Sue from the new Star Wars.So cool down on the politics...people that don't think Wonder Woman is the greatest female lead aren't necessarily misogynists forcing a male agenda....they may just be aware of Sarah Conner and Echo.Now...back to Wonder Woman.WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE DARK, REALISTIC, AND GRITTY?!?!?! Seriously, I only like one (1) of the Nolan Batman movies and...Wonder Woman and Superman and the Justice League are NOT Batman.I don't want to sit through a Super Hero movie that is bucking for ultra-realistic. If I wanted that, I'd see a drama.There are few super heroes that you can go totally dark and Gritty with, Batman, Dare Devil, Green Arrow....Speaking of Green Arrow, notice how he was dark and the Flash wasn't? Why can the WB understand this but not the film department? What you have here is a director trying to make a Batman movie using Wonder Woman and that doesn't work. If I want a dark and gritty female action protagonist I already have the Terminator and Alien franchises.the director, the studio, the writers should have concentrated more on making a Wonder Woman film and not another Batman movie...this failed for the same reason Batman V Superman did.","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

Backstory and World Establishment for 10 minutes Mini Greek Mythology (here is more similar to Christianity)
And I'm honest I had to fight through the first 20 minutes of the movie I was about to get up 5 times and drive home. (Because the costumes are almost as awful as in ""God of Egypt."")
Well, I have to say the backgrounds are quite pretty but the back story is pretty clumsy and the music is too monotonous.
The film was clearly made just to destroy the Bechtel test, but I would like to ask why the Queen Hip√≥lita was so naively written. Having heard the training instructions I've just gotten one head the movie is pretty dumb but only our main character is written with competence.Seriously! All are incompetent and naive except for Princess Diana and that puts the film and its massage in the wrong light.Even if I should just rate the movie as a movie, I can not say much good because I have seen and heard little good in this movie and the good things were not good enough.
The only positive things I want to mention is:
They gave Chris Pine the role that usually women in superheroes play movies with male heroes, I did not like it anyway but the idea was really thought through. Good job.
So I admit it was a nice idea to pack this whole in that scenario of the First World War. Instead of the second but the cut is editing dreadful and the CGI look FAKE.Its back to the principle that many stories are used that come with the evaluation, of course, 20 years would be kept away from the battlefield so the 0 fight-experience and yes not discovered his powers.
But my biggest problem is the fact that Princess Diana will be denied fighting for as long as I'm not going to say what was in the comics or in the animated series and so on, because that's not the point at all. My problem just it's DUMP!If I give birth to a child that is a demigod and I know the father will come back and visit her at some point, I train the child until the Super Saiyan-Mode so that my child can defend herself and is adequately competent enough later to take over the job as a monarch.
I also think it's pretty awful to still see films that look and are made exactly the same as they were 20 years ago without any improvement or real reason. This is backward development and as a movie fan I hate to see that. The story arc could be done better, as is the character arc in this movie. The fights are .... okay.The film is just full of stupid decisions empty comments and people who have not thought through to the end. I'm a bit confused and why the movie gets such good reviews but maybe I'm just a minute active, but I can not sympathize with you. Serious the movie can go to hell.So the movie is not even in ""the top 50 of the worst"" I've ever seen, but definitely in the top 3 of ""the movies that upset me the most.""PS .: Wonder Woman - ""I believe in love.""
Seriously? There are days when I think people write such lines, just to irritate me.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

An ideal response to the success of the competition would be to try and raise the quality of one's own products, but DC seem to think being more like Marvel is the way to go. That didn't do any favors to ""Suicide Squad"" and it's even worse a course of action for ""Wonder Woman"". There are too many good things to call ""Wonder Woman"" a bad film. It's not bad, it's just not as good as it could have been if it was allowed to benefit from DC sticking to their guns and be dark and serious.Coinciding with the centennial anniversary of the USA entering the World War I, the choice of the setting couldn't be better. There aren't many WWI films out there, and it's a great topic to be explored even if it's just a vehicle for a superhero origin story. To that regard, I found the script remarkably restrained in the usual playing fast and loose with history, and I didn't notice many jarring transgressions other than making a historical German general Ludendorff a comic book villain. The general feeling of depression, futility and hypocrisy of ""The War To End All Wars"" is there, and that's what counts. Then there is that mesmerising golden-brown cinematography that is by now an established trademark for DC. Nowhere else did it serve a better purpose than in this throwback to the era of early colour photographs, and it helped the film look even more 1910s. The opening scenes, set in the Ancient Greece, quite make up for the current lack of good Greek mythology-themed films out there. Gal Gadot is very comfortable and believable as the titular heroine, with her presence and thick accent working very much in her favour. David Thewlis made wonders beyond what his dialogue would allow and was a pleasure to watch. Some action scenes, especially in the grand finale, do strike an emotional chord and are done rather neatly and cleanly, which is quite a refreshment in the sea of overedited, choppy action of nowadays.Too bad the shortcomings of ""Wonder Woman"" stick out just as well as the good parts. There is, firstly, the silly plot. There are pronoun games, heavy handed expositions, twists and revelations which even a mildly keen viewer typically guessed halfway through the film. The motivation of the main character is incoherent, sometimes illogical and it often serves just to make the plot points happen. The vacuum between anything happening is filled with dialogue that ranges from awkward and clumsy to downright stupid. One exchange went like this: ""Humanity is good!"", ""You are lying and I must kill you!"", ""I believe in love!"". One doesn't get to hear that in an A-film often.The ""Marvel"" part comes in the shape of the characters that help Diana aka Wonder Woman throughout the film. Chris Pine's rendition of Steve Trevor is over the top awkward. He never connects to Diana properly and the implied love story is unbelievable. Pine does have his moments thanks to his boyish charm, but generally he has been let to do too much. The sidekick characters do even worse. They are too goofy and their dialogue is too frivolous and trying too hard for a comic relief that they just stick out like a sore thumb in the gloomy setting. Also they are not given anything meaningful to do so they more or less just clutter up the screen and the screen time. Greatly lacking is the mise en sc√®ne. The backdrop is there and the sets are impeccably designed. But the scenes in London are not populated enough with interesting characters and the film would benefit from more people reacting to the novelty of armor-clad woman in the post-Victorian England. It would also benefit from showing more grit and horrors of the WWI, but I guess in the battle for the PG-13 label sacrifices had to be made.Much has been made of the fact that one of the most expensive films with a female as the main character has been directed by a female director. It has even been touted as a big deal by recent female presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton. Unfortunately, Patty Jenkins did in this production the same thing Mrs. Clinton would have done in the Oval Office - get lost. A Wander Woman, if you will. She lacks pace, focus and determination. Her shots are all over the place, editing is slow and inconsistent and the film overally doesn't get off the ground until it's almost over. She seems to leave the main actors too much on their own, but what's worse, she even lets the extras overact. Someone with a tighter grip over the production was sorely needed here. Jenkins just aimed to please the powers that be. The difference between the good and the bad action scenes in the film prompt me to believe that Zack Snyder took over at least for the final showdown, because that particular scene was almost every bit as good as the finale of ""Batman v Superman"". If that one was also done by Jenkins after all, power to her.""Dumb but good-looking"" is not the label I like to ascribe to DC films. Not that they've ever been overly smart, but I remember how seeing ""Man of Steel"" left me with the feeling ""man, that's how it should be done"" and I wanted more of that. Come to think of it, I can't even say that the new direction is really trying to emulate Marvel. It's just an aimless departure from adult themed stories in the hope of winning that teen buck. And sure enough, the screening I attended was filled with kids. They were laughing in all the wrong places.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

I want to like it more, share the enthusiasm but... Wonder Woman has incredibly severe flaws that can't make it a *good* movie by any stretch of the imagination. Probably the biggest issue is the acting. Both leads have very limited acting skills... It takes you out of the movie more often than once. Some scenes are forced, some dialogue overdone like an SNL skit... simply not possible. The ultimate bad guy is a joke. Straight out of GOD OF WAR PlayStation game (really). Not credible for a second.And, also, on a more personal note, this is the moment where I realized the Zack Snyder school of filming action movies needs to be abandoned. Over abundant jumping, too heavy slo-mo... after three? four? movies of that; it's time to retire it. It's a shame really because the movie started well enough: having a female lead was great; the Greek mythology clicked for the most part and the World War I setting was nice. The character is also fantastic. Which is why it deserved better It's only average unfortunately. **cue in the annoying guitar rift**","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

I'm not even sure why I'm giving this mess 3 stars. There's so many things wrong, it's easier to point out the few good things. I mean I guess the fighting scenes were okay (for example, the Amazons' training at the beginning was nice), there was obviously some money put into things like set, costumes etc (production value), and I must admit that Chris Pine was quite charming ... at least compared to Gal Gadot, who unfortunately can't act, leading to heaps of cringe-inducing moments (I'm sorry, but Wonder Woman is portrayed like an imbecile).
Apart from that, the story was bonkers, the character development was non-existent, there were more plot-holes than things that made sense, the humor was off ... But what irked me the most was that all things combined, Wonder Woman bored me to death. I don't expect a superhero movie to be Oscar-material, but I want to be able to follow the story, get immersed into a different world that is fictional but makes sense in itself, I want to feel with the protagonists and I want to be entertained. All of that didn't happen here. I don't know if I'll ever waste my time watching a DC movie again to be honest ...

It's a pretty entertaining summary of her childhood leading to her training to becoming a warrior. Robin Wright was the perfect actress to portray Antiope. However, her life on Themyscira, an isolated island from the outside world, is thrown into chaos when soldiers during the Great War suddenly appear. Both the Amazons and the Germans, plus one horribly miscast Chris Pine, are equally surprised and a battle ensues. Seeing the Amazons shocked by how guns work was quite laughable, as it reinforces the idea of ""waiting until the world needs us"" nonsense is completely useless.Diana leaves the island with Chris Pine's Steven Trevor to hunt down Ares, the final living son of Zeus who she believes is the sole reason for the war going on. This is the stupidest concept I've ever seen put on screen. She spends enough time in the world to see that human beings have free will, and you can't blame all the bad things on a magical being that forced everyone to be at war. Of course, they only refer to the European nations, because why care about Africa and Asia?The film was beautifully shot, and the action scenes were mostly well done. We don't need everybody to have a slow motion pose and attack sequence, however.Once Ares is revealed, and Diana finally grows a brain in her stupid head, the movie shifts to be what it should have been in the first place. I'm hoping that her sudden shift in character will be explored more in Justice League, but I dread that answer. I'm telling you, Zack Snyder is trash and needs to get a new career.Chances are, reading this review in 2024, you've already seen the movie and have formed your own opinion. It's not bad enough for me to say run the other way, but it's certainly not good. To sum up my feelings on Gal Godot as an actress: I don't think she did a bad job, but she was given horrible writing and direction.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

That's not saying much. The film is un original, predictable, and poorly written. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine do manage to have some charming moments, the directing and cinematography are decent, and the color pallet and costume design is top notch, but the films script really holds it back.
Wonder Woman is not a well written character. She's way to perfect and over powered. The writers were more concerned about writing a strong female lead than actually writing a good character with interesting conflict. I've been told by some of my female friends that I just don't get it. This is false. I can appreciate why woman and young girls enjoy the film while still realizing that it's not flawless. I just wish more people could do the same. It doesn't matter what gender your main character is. They must be interesting. Wonder Woman is not interesting. I would recommend it to fans of superhero movies, but not to any other moviegoer.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

As a symbol of equality, power, and truth, her natural confidence and unmistakable intelligence made her unequaled.Wonder Woman's origin story relates that she was sculpted from clay by her mother Queen Hippolyta and given life by Aphrodite, along with superhuman powers as gifts by the Greek gods
The Amazons are technologically advanced peaceful civilization. The movie throws everything unique about Wonder Woman makes her a generic as possible. She is now the daughter of Zeus, the Bill Cosby of Greek Mythology. Amazons are stuck in 300BC because they are women and are not capable of inventing anything in 2000 years .She kills dozens of German soldiers like they are born Nazis. The movie most glaring problem is it's villains. They are generic bad guy with cringy dialogues. The main villain comes in the last 10 minutes of the movie ,says confusing things and unclear motives ,fights Diana in Bad CGI armor and is killed by Deus ex machina power.
The movie has a lot of plot holes like How a tiny boat reached from Turkey to London in four days , How Amazons know English and How does invisible barrier work. 
Wonder Woman stays hidden for 100 years until Batman sents an Email .
It is sad the DC changed so many things about Wonder Woman and made her generic while Marvel proudly embraced it in Black Panther.
Hope we get a better accurate Wonder Woman movie.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

But, srsly guys, this movie is barely average.
The acting is passable, the plot is not all that interesting, there are some major continuity errors and character inconsistencies that I spotted just on my first screening and all in all there is not so much going on. The last words of the movie left me face palming hard, since Diana is speaking to us like a schoolgirl would.
It's not a really bad movie either - the effects are great except for when the film is not trying to impress us too much. There are parts that feel rather silly, like a comic book - AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT THING, except 98% of the film does not feel like a comic book! You have these over the top awesome moments that have you gaping at the screen and, on their own are amazing, but they have nothing to do with the flow and feeling of the rest of the film.
It could have been worse. Much worse.
Oh, and one last thing - 
Why does Diana fall in love with the very first ""above average- man she ever sees? What is she, like, a Disney princess? Is it 1995 and we have Pocahontas all over again?

It is so obvious. I kept wondering if this movie was made in the early 2000's!!! How poorly can such an expensive movie use such bad camera angles in front of something as simple as a green screen? And every action scene was in slow motions! you can't do that!!!-The first half of the movie was sooo slow I had to hold my eyes open To prevent me from falling asleep, then the rest I couldn't make sense Of the movie and I really don't think the writers knew either. Wonder A woman stumbles through the movie like a naive 15 year old imbecile who Hasn't hit puberty yet., she's a goddess for crying out loud (I know they tried to make it obvious she was a stranger to the World she just Entered, but for love of Gods they didn't have to make her stupid!!), the logic for not telling her who she really is, screwed up the movie . The way she kills Ares at the end, could have been achieved by telling her who she really was earlier, granted, it would have been a short movie but better. -And me-Wow, she can talk different languages such superhero powers very amazing! I don't get why they tried to make it so obvious, they could have focused on something else.-i didn't get why they had to show different races so obviously i mean, come on skirt, hat,... Are we 8?Gal Gadot part: -First of all, she was not a good choice for WW, physically amazon ladies are not stick thin models surviving on a lettuce leaf diet. and i don't get why everyone was praising the ""Israeli actress"" ,She had this weird accent and when she talked, she did this extra head movement which looked ridiculous. also bad bad acting oh my god.-It seemed like Gal Gadot was constantly posing for a photo shoot instead of acting!! I don't know if it was all the feminists that boosted the rating of this movie, if it was¬Ö that's extremely sad.Logic/mythology:-WW's aunt sacrifices her life so that WW doesn't get shot from behind early in the movie. Later in the movie the villain tells her she's a god and only a god can kill a god. This renders her aunt's sacrifice an act of suicide because the movie went out of its way to tell the audience that all the Amazon Women knew she was a god. -WW's mom, the queen, tells everyone not to do something only to have everyone disobey her. Not just once, but EVERY time she says don't do something, someone does exactly the opposite. I.E. Don't train my daughter to fight, don't let this guy leave the island, don't go with the guy leaving the island. -Zeus creates the Amazons to defeat Ares. In actual mythology, the tribe of Amazons were the offspring of, wait for it.... Ares and Harmonia - a nymph. So, Ares is WW's father, not brother. Yup! Then Zeus, creates a child of his to serve as a weapon against Ares to save mankind, Wonder Women. Really? This sounds odd and forced in a Greek setting. Humor:-They dedicated a continuous 15-20 min segment and it all stems from the cultural differences between the Amazonians and humans. The bath scene (**Average man!** if only this part was done by a woman and we had all hell broke loose), sleeping in the boat, the secretary, the clothes trials... all stems from the same issue. It's the same material stretched for 15 mins Music: Not bad. Not memorable either. in other word, Meh.**Overall, this is a bad movie, made not to entertain but a quick money maker with main selling point: ""Female Lead"". Very overrated. This movie could have been something amazing, something that had new things to say, shame it didn't **I don't do IMDb review but this movie sucked so much i had to I gather some of the best points people made and some of mine","2 out of 10 found this helpful.

While visually stunning, the film's main flaw lies in the casting choice of the lead actress, whose beauty takes center stage, overshadowing any acting prowess.Despite the movie's promising premise and engaging storyline, the lack of acting skills from the main actress becomes painfully evident as the plot unfolds. Her expressions seem forced, and her delivery lacks the depth required to bring the character to life. It feels as though she was chosen primarily for her appearance, neglecting the fundamental requirement of genuine acting talent.The film's supporting cast does their best to salvage the scenes, showcasing commendable performances that manage to capture the audience's attention. However, the stark contrast between their abilities and the lead actress's wooden portrayal creates a jarring viewing experience.Furthermore, the film's potential for character development is squandered, as the focus remains on the protagonist's beauty rather than her inner struggles or growth. This missed opportunity leaves viewers yearning for a more nuanced and compelling narrative.On a positive note, the movie's visual effects and cinematography are a feast for the eyes, offering moments of awe-inspiring spectacle. The production team's efforts in creating a visually captivating world deserve applause, even though they are ultimately let down by the lackluster performance of the main actress. The decision to cast an actress based solely on her beauty has proven detrimental to the overall quality of the movie, leaving viewers longing for a more engaging and authentic portrayal of the characters.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

However, if this movie is being submitted for Best Picture, I guess some where some people are seeding the reviews. Gal Gadot is nice looking, and as good in the role as the material she got; the picture is not a good picture. Yadda yadda yadda but at the end of the day, no matter how many charges of misogyny against reviewers, the movie did not come together; there are many things wrong with it from a story telling point and also from a technical point of view. It is not a good movie. It tanks the franchise. And no, this movie cannot increase in its rating from 54% to 74% with thousands of new votes when they weren't there before. That's obvious. What is not obvious is if anyone is ""getting it"" on the other side: studio, producer, director, writers, and so on. It's just a terrible movie; it did not have to be but it turned out that way. Honest to God, please don't make such crap anymore. And if those who are upticking the rankings have no shame in doing so, know you can't hide why the original rankings were so bad. You can't hide why the movie stalled 92% in China after its first week. I could go on but why bother? It is a bad movie; the ratings fix is in.

The acting is really bad and the characters reactions to about everything that pops up are never credible. The effects that I mentioned being sometimes inspiring are equally bad, as if the effort is only reserved to a few scenes. The decisions and conclusions that the characters made are not built up enough and it feels like they come out of the air. The dialogue is so bad it hurt sometimes and scenes that are supposed to be serious become laughable, take this for example (occurs at about 3 minutes in setting the tone for the depth in the dialogue):Woman 1: ""Looks very good""
Woman 2: ""Very good""
Woman 1: ""How's she?"" *pointing*
Woman 2: ""She's good"" *pointing*
Woman 1: ""Keep working"" *pointing*Haha it both looks and sounds very funny, even better with context. Scenes like these creates a vibe not to take the movie seriously and I get the feeling that it is unintentionally goofy.It seems to me that only the fans has been giving this the high IMDB-rate and I really hope it evens out so that the wider audience can decide if they want to spend 2 hours for what I felt was a disapointment.","1 out of 4 found this helpful.

Unfortunately though, this movie doesn't fit with the 1970s original, where she definitely is not a god and why they decided here to incorporate this distasteful aspect to her being is offensive and disrespectful. On a brighter note, the action scenes are impressive and even thrilling in parts but this doesn't feature enough through its lengthy run time. Too many portions of meandering and silly conversations damages the overall impact and it feels like a stop/start affair. I did enjoy the message of love conquering all even if in this world not much love exists and not even Wonder Woman is capable of achieving such, as she herself acknowledges towards the end of the movie. Still, Gal Gadot's portrayal provides a positivity and the urge to keep striving for peace and happiness and these sentiments don't go unnoticed. If they'd condensed this down to 100 minutes max this would have ensured a tighter, more effective viewing experience. Still, it's worth a watch if only for seeing Gal Gadot in action.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

Given the quality of the other films though, this is a fairly low bar to cross. Patty Jenkins brings some much-needed competency to the previously established world of Batman and Superman, but the final result is ultimately no better than a standard superhero affair. This begins feeling like a Marvel movie and ends as a DC movie in the worst way possible - somewhere in the middle, however, there are glimpses of promise.Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) is the titular character, an Amazonian princess shut off from the world outside, incomparably strong but lacking in experience. When a British spy (Chris Pine) unintentionally lands on the shore of the Amazon's secret island, Diana is thrust into the First World War in order to find and stop Ares, the god of war supposedly behind it all. Gadot's acting is often subpar, especially in more dramatic scenes, though she certainly looks the part and is a very capable model - she spends much of the film posing, even looking like she's auditioning for a shampoo commercial in one of the movie's sillier moments. Surrounding her is a cast of refreshingly talented character actors, including David Thewlis (""Naked"") and Ewen Bremner (""Trainspotting"").Narration is used in a painfully clich√©d and lazy way to bookend the story. The first 40 minutes take place on Themyscira, the paradise island inhabited only by Amazon women, including several scenes with Diana as a child. This is a tired way to build the audience's affection, hurt even more by her having to try to replicate Gadot's accent. These early scenes mainly function as a way to serve heaps of exposition, including dreadfully obvious setups for a later twist (""You have greater powers than you know""; ""She must never know the truth about what she is""). The film as a whole is overlong, and could have benefited from some trimming at each end: the focus on Themyscira is reminiscent of the drawn out sequences on Krypton which plague adaptations of Superman.Well-saturated colours may surprise those who have watched DC's previous, miserably dark affairs; the crisp and bright blues and greens of Themyscira serve as a noticeable contrast to the greys of wartime Europe. The visual style as a whole is pleasant, with an unfortunate over-reliance on slow motion which has been an annoying feature of Snyder's projects as well. Some of the visual effects work is also unconvincing. It is clear that Jenkins is not an action director. The action sequences are not awful, but often feel less well crafted than simple dialogue scenes. Certain parts - such as a confrontation in an alleyway - are a bit of a mess. Overhead shots are used effectively among other commendable camerawork.The score is overbearing throughout, and Wonder Woman's electric guitar theme is jarringly out of place. It has been heard previously in Batman v Superman and is even less fitting here. Thankfully the song is played only a handful of times towards the third act. Overly sappy music is used in a laughably poor death scene before we leave the island, and again to little effect in later sections in which we are expected to well up.Pine and Gadot have surprisingly solid chemistry, and as such their scenes are the best in the picture. Interactions in a boat and a Belgian town are both warm and convincing. There are attempts at comedy, most of which fall flat: only so much laughter can be drawn from Diana not understanding the customs of our world. As expected, there is some welcome feminist commentary, though its handling is indicative of the film's lack of subtlety. Little of substance is communicated and the messaging is entirely shelved in favour of war scenes fairly quickly.The plot, involving Steve Trevor (the hilariously generic name of Chris Pine's character) and Diana trying to put an end to World War One, is often clunky. Throughout there are convenient and questionable beats used to establish or resolve different elements of the story (he doubts whether Diana is strong, so let's have a man come in and threaten them with a gun!). Clearly the film wants the German villains to be Nazis - the politicians and military leaders of the Kaiserreich were not this comically evil. ""Dr. Poison"" (Elena Anaya) conducts chemical experiments similar to Josef Mengele, and General Ludendorff (Thewlis) consumes what I can only describe as magic super cocaine.While watching, I was pleasantly surprised in the direction the film was going, as it seemed to be setting itself up for a more mature ending than previous DC movies. Trevor tells Prince: ""You don't think I wish I could tell you that it was one bad guy to blame? It's not!"" Quite right. Unfortunately I gave it too much credit. Wonder Woman's na√Øvet√© is proven right as, yes, it turns out to win the war you just have to kill one guy. A fake-out ending is set up - apparently just to work in a twist for the sake of having one - by having the supposed villain act so cartoonish that the film overcompensates and it becomes clear something fishy is going on. The twist is nonsensical from a script standpoint and only serves the role of allowing the last half hour to be a complete shit-show of ridiculous monologues and ugly CG fighting.It seems that Diana's inexperience is only rewarded throughout. She is told not to go into no man's land, yet she waltzes right in and wins a great victory. What are we to learn from this? Her arc appears to be that she learns to trust in humanity (""only love can save the world"" is the final line) but she was the only Amazon in the first place to want to help Steve Trevor. This is not the only way in which the film contradicts itself; for all her constant insistence that every life is valuable and we should help innocent people, Diana certainly shows little hesitation in killing conscripted German soldiers and mercenaries. A strange morality to be sure.Wonder Woman has long stretches which are overwhelmingly superior to every other film in the DCEU. All the more shame, then, that it reverts to stupidity in the end.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

No memorable Villain. and in my opinion the important lack is To this day, World War I is viewed by historians as an immensely complex and misunderstood period in history, and as such it's a hugely controversial subject.So whilst Wonder Woman should be admired for its willingness to set the action in and amongst the horrors of The Great War, a territory that most action films these days - especially superhero movies - would be eager to steer clear of, it does ultimately end up feeling like something of a missed opportunity.There were no clear bad guys in World War I, after all; no easy-to-hate Nazis to fight, like in the far more clear-cut conflict that was World War II. But the complex nature of the war isn't really explored: the Germans are still painted as pretty generic bad guys, and there's no attempt in the movie to explore the war as anything other than a ""setting."" It serves as an aesthetic, when it could have been a whole lot more In total, lost of loops. Don't go for it.
Its Truly disappointment.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

With all the hype surrounding a big budget film that cast Gal Gadot as the main character, who just happens to be a woman, and the advertising that was poured into portraying Wonder Woman as the positive antithesis to the vulgarity that is ""man"" (and elevated female prowess by association), it didn't stand up to many of the movies in the superhero genre (such as Civil War, Iron Man 3, etc.). While the film at its moments with flashes of brightness and endearment, the best part of the movie involved the natural chemistry between WW and Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), but the rest of the movie was left for interpretation as to whether it was great (WW lovers camp), mediocre, or really bad. I fall in the middle for the following reasons:1. Gal Gadot is beautiful, but her acting performance was OK. It was not a break-out role for her by any stretch of the imagination. Much of the dialogue in a number of scenes involved screaming back at Steve and that's hardly acting. She is easy on the eyes to look at, to hear (when not screaming), to like, and I wanted so much to be absorbed by her portrayal of a superhuman with a fine balance of perfections and flaws, but in the end, she reduced to just another pretty face. 2. The CGI and action scenes were so-so. They weren't the best nor were they the worst. Perhaps what made some it fatiguing at times was the frequent use of slow-motion jump twists that the Amazonians and WW herself do. Granted, I'd rather see those moves than the more laughable Scarlett Johansson jump on the shoulder-squeeze the neck with thighs move in the IM and CA movies. Simply put, they could have hired a better fight choreographer for the actresses, as many sequences were simply not believable or too cheesy to digest. 3. Wonder Woman was too powerful. She could have simply taken care of ending the war by herself, crushing all the evil males, while Steve and his male recruits (Chief et al.) were not nearly as relevant to any degree - maybe for the sake of comic relief and emotional empathy. 4. The main villain, Ares (David Thewlis), immediately gave me flashbacks of Harry Potter. There was a scene where I just thought, ""No way Remus!"" The scene to me was more comical than it was believable.There was one person in the theater, a woman, who clapped incessantly throughout the movie, especially when WW raised her shield to fight off a bunch of baddies on the front line to the amazement and disbelief of Steve and fellows. While I understand this was somewhat about girl-power, it did get artificial and annoying. Perhaps Gal Gadot can win me over in the sequel :-)","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

And I'm sorry Gal Gadot is not really pretty. Her accent and voice are annoying.
The romance is pointless, Steve doesn't even look interested on her, while she's totally smitten with him(in the cartoon it's pretty much the contrary). The action is weak. The story is lackluster, the villains are cheesy, her powers are confusing.

I was promised a good viewing experience, but what I got was a tedious slog.While Wonder Woman manages to be the most competent film the DCEU, it's also the most boring. BvS and Suicide Squad may have been disasters, but it's possible for one to find enjoyment in such unbelievable levels of incompetence. There's a point where a film becomes so incomprehensibly inept that it ceases to be a film, and turns into some kind of performance art. Wonder Woman, unfortunately, never reaches that point and remains so painfully mediocre it's not even fun to watch as a joke.Wonder Woman reportedly had a budget over 100 million dollars, but one is left wondering where all that money went, as the it's filled with some of the worst CGI in modern cinema. None of the jokes made me laugh, but the CGI in Wonder Woman had me in stitches, and that's before it devolved into the usual DC CGI mess at the end.The final nail in the coffin of Wonder Woman as a film is that it chooses to end with one of the worst looking and tensionless CGI boss fights in modern cinema, rather than exploring more interesting ideas present throughout the film.I'll give credit where credit is due. Both Gal Gadot and Chris Pine make the most of the script they were given. Unfortunately not even their serviceable performances could save this film from being a 140 minute snooze-fest.While Wonder Woman proves to be the most competent film in the DCEU, it also proves that it's better to be hilariously incompetent than painfully mediocre.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

First and foremost, I'll have to say this. I'll warn you that I may be chauvinistic to both sexes here. I was doubtful if female director can successfully pull off a testosterone ""male"" oriented blockbuster. Point Break is awesome, but Hurt Locker and Punisher:WZ I found to be boring and uninteresting. However, when it as announced that woman will direct WW, I felt they got it as I believe that only a female director can give the character justice. Of course, it if was a guy, it may totally be the same movie, so I digress.But first before getting on the movie, let me say that I am not much of a fan of WW (neither I read many comics - Perez I love, Azzarello run and Hiketeia I intensely dislike, though I admire what the Finch couple did). About the movie: I think it's very, fair, honest and sympathetic portrayal of the title character, the best it can get and much in vein of Donner Superman IMO. Moreover, Gal is beautiful, sexy and lethal in equal measures (though I am bit nostalgic for Linda Carter:grin:) And this WW is bereft of the superhero antics I find in Nolan/Snyder verse, where are frustrated, confused character with phrases like:""should I do it; who am I; it hurts me being superhero, hurts me when being not..."". No, this character is a hero and wants it to be. And I believe, just as the poster for Superman (1978) - ""You'll believe a man can fly"".On the other hand, the plot is already chewed-up and clich√©d. It didn't engage me much. I am not particularly convinced with Pine's performance (but he did good). Thewlis, though, ruined it for me. His later ""reveal""... well, can't say I've seen it coming, but it didn't surprise me, either. Also, I find the main villain fight to be a bit cheap, tedious, and unconvincing, with WW all of suddenly unleash all her fury, before seriously eating dirt.As for action scenes; the special effects are impressive, but the action itself I find just ostensibly thrilling. Don't know, probably because, I've grown spoiled, petulant and craving for more over the years, so that nothing much can surprise me. And flawed he may be, Snyder knows how to make a glory spectacle. Sorry, Patty.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

In fact, this movie is the most unimaginative and the weakest entry in the franchise so far.There are two good things about the movie really, and those are the leads. First, Gal Gadot is drop-dead gorgeous, this cannot be denied. He acting can be sub-par at times, but overall she plays her part well. Second, Chris Pine is still a charismatic dude who, also being a primary protagonist, delivers his performance well enough and has some of the better comedic moments.But the problem is, that's about it! The action in the movie goes from mediocre to outright messy, with overabundance of CGI and shaky editing. The CGI in general often looks visibly cheap. The sidekick characters are clich√© (the only thing that Scotsman lacked was a bagpipe) or cringy (the plump woman, but thank God that's not Melissa McCarthy). The villain is just pathetic, with the cringiest lines imaginable, stereotypical lines like ""Join me or die"" and tedious lecturing on the morality of man. Compared to somebody like Zod from Man of Steel it's just unacceptable. The ""humor"" here is often out of place with the overall serious war tone of the movie, and goes from the passable ""Diana says some ridiculous stuff about Greek Gods while Steve looks skeptical"" to the unbearably ludicrous ""Oh look they talk about sex in a very uncomfortable way"". The plot is just bland and overused, as are most of the dialogues, especially in Themyscira (""You must not go, Diana. Okay, go Diana."") Oh, and our wannabe- pacifist-serial-killer heroine defeats the big baddie using ""the power of love"", amazing.So yeah, there is almost nothing to love in this movie, the fact that the critics praised it just shows how hypocritical they are, the main reason for this is the fact that it's female-directed and female-led, which are not important factors when rating a movie in my book. My last hope in the DCEU is the Justice League and I sincerely hope that Weadon will not screw up Snyder's vision in it.","1 out of 9 found this helpful.

I've never seen a more bland protagonist that makes so little sense for her actions at the same time as being a walking contradiction. The writer has disgraced women and I feel bad for Gal Gadot who had to play such a confusing role.

Diana is later brought into the ""other world"" during World War I and works with Steve Trevor (Chris Pine), a military captain. The two have similar goals but with very different perceptions of what is happening.The beginning third of the film is superb. The Amazon island is idyllic and the other-worldly cultural perspective of its inhabitants is fascinating. There is also great amusement and enjoyment when Diana enters the ""normal"" world where her wiser Amazon outlook is very out-of-place.The second third of the film is quite good as well but sadly, things deteriorate by the final third. The mythology that was so welcome in the beginning gets jumbled and confusing in the concluding segment. The final disintegration is guaranteed after a major decision is made. It is not just eye-rollingly hoaky and unbelievable; it's not even comprehensible.Gadot and Pine are likeable and certainly good-looking but they are not always up to par for lead roles. There are times their performances come off as weak though they are good for most of the movie. Overall, it's too bad the film's great beginning went so far downhill by the end.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Wonder Woman's mythological origin reminded me of Marvel's Thor movies, and the world war setting of Captain America. The quality level is about the same. Maybe about as good as the first Captain America movie and slightly better than Thor films.I really have nothing much to say. It was a movie that was not completely painful to watch but nothing very interesting either. I wasn't very bored, but after watching wished that I don't have to watch it again. It followed a similar pattern as some other superhero movies; the beginning was more interesting but towards the end it became mindless boring action with boring effects.If you usually like this kind of movies, then you might like this one.

Let me start off by saying your main character should never have a bad rep in real life...especially when portraying someone that upholds truth and justice. That being said, while I love Gadot's accent, the actual woman puts me off in that her role in the IDF made her top consideration for this project...WAIT WHAT? Yeah, that's right. the IDF, the army that brutalizes the young, the old and the infirm in Palestine. Wonder Woman and the amazons are meant to protect mankind, yet we see their main fight against the Germans...back to Israel again and the injustices committed against the jewish nation. We never get a break from this story. We see you inserted an Israeli actress...playing the heroine. The movie was reminiscent of a ""what the evil germans did to us"" pamphlet and how Israel rises above. Hollywood is run by Zionists, this is a prime example.

Patty Jenkins clearly is at her best when dealing with character interactions.When directing action scenes, she's not bad, but she does have a bit of a tendency to overuse slow motion at points, and on that note, holy crap the effects in this film haven't improved at all from any of the others. In fact, they may have gotten even worse.And like I said before, the narrative and characters are okay, even if I think they could have been good, were it not for one thing, the single biggest mistake this film makes: I absolutely d e s p i s e how it ended. I won't spoil it, but for a few minutes, it was going in a way that honestly had me thinking it would be a very mature and interesting ending to a film like this...and then big CGI nearly indestructable beings punch each other really hard for ten minutes, just like every other film like this, and it completely ruins what they were building up to for virtually the whole film. It's a clear cut case of a film trying to have its cake and eat it too.But still...I'd watch this another ten times before ever sitting through Suicide Squad again.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

With dramatic improvements in techniques relating to in production as well as post processing of movies, big production houses calling for a reboot of a franchise is not totally unreasonable.However what is unjustified is the lack of attention they have been giving to the sexes! All the franchises have one thing in common - their intent is to showcase macho men and how the world becomes a better place because of them (with the exception of X-Men)!It is 2017, and girl superheroes find a footing at last. When I watched¬†Wonder Woman (2017), what stuck me the most was not how beautiful the main star was - it was how the action was fixated around her and how Gal Gadot seems to have been able to absorb all that attention so gracefully.Chris Pine stars as the ""more-than-average-looking"" Steve Trevor and has acted his part with extreme sincerity. David Thewlis and Danny Huston play pivotal roles in the movie as well.While the back story from Diana's childhood (involving ancient Greek gods) continue as the central theme of the movie, I felt that the storyline did not have enough meat or surprises to outpace other recent superhero movies! To me characters like Charlie or Sameer¬†(the artists themselves did a good job) were unnecessary to the plot itself. These were possibly introduced only to help improve the humour quotient the movie lacked. I will discuss that in my more detailed review.Please read the full review (with spoilers) at http://blog.nrajesh.com/review- wonder-woman-2017/","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The movie, unlike other superhero movies, didn't have the same purpose: to bring action and show the adventures that superheros go through. Instead, it shows issues concerning historical facts, like women's right to the vote, just to send a message that isn't what the movie follows, what unfortunately could make the film an over-two-hour boring experience.
The film starts with the beginning of everything: Diana lives in Themyscira with the Amazons, with no contact with men. One day, a man who's escaping from the Nazis penetrates into the island, and (no surprise) is saved from drowning by Diana. From there on, she will be dragged everywhere by Steve, who uses her help to defeat the Germans. Some scenes were supposed to be funny by joking about Diana's innocence, like when she tries on some dresses and asks how women could fight a war wearing that. In that regard, the film succeeds but also fails at times - some jokes are just cringy. 
The movie takes place in the UK in the context of World War I, and that is, for me, its biggest letdown: Wonder Woman, a super strong hero, fights mostly against humans - soldiers in war and their guns. No need to say those scenes are, at most, interesting for the special effects, when she is in the trenches. On the other hand, there are no super villains yet for her to combat and give us the big emotion (as expected) of watching a DC movie. The final fight and the revelation happen at the end, which I found a very nice way to end the movie, with a well elaborated conversation between Diana and her god brother, who intends to lead humanity to do what he believes to be their fate: chaos and destruction. However, the movie, which throughout the past 2 hours had explored a romance between Diana and Steve, gave her a reason to fight for the humans, since she was in love with one (even though the sole purpose of Zeus creating the Amazons was for them to protect mankind). And, at that point, I could only be very sorry for Hollywood weakening such an icon of bravery. The feminine character is, unlike Batman, Superman, etc once more, portrayed as a compassionate helper rather than a strong protagonist.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

I will start with a few.: Gal Gadot looked wonderful. The actions scenes were entertaining,.. for the most part. Well that is about it. Now for the bad parts: Pretty much everything else. The script was horrible, the editing was all over the place, the directing was just aweful, and the script was terrible and the acting seemed very disengenuine. The script was terrible. And then they hd WW doing things that she never did in any other program or book... For example - fly. Womder Woman Doesn't Fly! She also doesn't sligng around like Spiderman from her lasso. The lasso gets longer if she just holds in teh direction she threw it. It can even catch passing jets to help her fly... 500 miles and hour. They hop into a jet that neighther of them have flown and become one with the wind... because that is all you need to fly a jet fighter. Did I mention the bad script? Those are many more reasons to skip this nonsense.
i just listed a few. Parts were entertaining, but other parts were boring. It was way too long and it had a terrible script. The CGI of her slinging her lasso and flying through the air behind it and scooping people up was very off in the editing. The love scene was just awkward, but the script was terrible.Skip this turkey. I was looking forward to it too. Sorry I did it.

To not like a movie like this is tantamount to admitting you're a sexist pig.Whelp.To be clear, I don't think this is bad, I just don't really get the hype. To me it's just another tonally inconsistent DC movie that is clearly wanting to be one thing but just isn't. Wonder Woman is a great character and this whole time it feels like she's being lead around by guys and told what to do. The villain is super generic, the final fight is a snooze and the gags just don't do it for me.This is super frustrating because Gadot is a specTACULAR choice for Wonder Woman. She looks the part, fits the role, she's the perfect modern choice for the character and these movies just have to be made by DC in a time when they don't have a firm grasp on what they're doing. The performances and the casting here are great but everything around it feels so meh to me.Despite the above, I'd say this is worth checking out, especially if you have or are interested in HBO Max it's available to stream. I know I'm the minority on this one. People loved this movie and that's awesome, I just don't see it. To me it's a perfectly generic DC comics flick with a solid cast and awful finale.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'm not a big fan of superhero movies anyway. There are just so many of them, and only a few of them are any good. I finally got around to seeing this movie a couple of days ago. While I enjoyed watching it, I also thought it really didn't live up to the hype.I enjoyed the movie overall, and I thought Gal Gadot's performance was very good. I also liked finally seeing a superhero movie directed by a woman. I believe Patty Jenkins did a very good job in directing this film. Chris Pike also did very well, and as far as characters go, Wonder Woman and Steve Trevor are very good.On the other hand, there was plenty that I didn't like about this movie. For example, I thought most of the characters were shallow and not developed well at all. Most of the villains in the movie seemed to have no motivations whatsoever. In other words, they were ""bad"" only because the script required them to be.It was very hard for me to accept the dialogue. It seemed to have been written for a Saturday morning cartoon. I did my best to ignore what the characters were saying and just watched the visuals.I was annoyed at the overuse of slow motion. Once or twice would have been fine, but seeing it over and over again was really tiresome.At 141 minutes, this movie is too long. I would have preferred somewhere around 110 minutes instead. Superhero films are not supposed to be epics. The script was too weak to hold up for that long.There were a lot of plot holes that never were answered. I won't mention them here because I want to avoid spoilers. But the script needed a little more work to fill in the missing details.Overall, this was a fun movie, but it really could have been so much better.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Big deal, same old crap to entertain the masses. First, she was sexualized, otherwise there wouldnt of been the skirts and cleavage so not buying that. The reviews when it was in theatres was that people left crying! Not sure why... it was another predictable plot more focused on special effects than storyline. The slo-mo fighting was too annoying, movie-wide. Best they could come up with was ares? Really? Not sure why feminists thought this was a step in the right direction, i would of never been able to tell if a male or female directed based on movie. Also, wtf is up with the stupid accents? That really pisses me off. So what, all germans and amazons speak english?! You know i thought i was missing out not seeing this movie from what id heard. My brother rented it and finally gave it a chance. After 1 hour i was just waiting for it to over. It was almost 2.5 hours long, jeez. The only good thing about this movie is my gal Gal.

The action was basic as was the overall directionI do like the main theme they used, just a shame there are no good scenes to play it over. Chris Pine was probably the only good cast member.A lot of reviews I believe are false due to people's obsession with ""women's empowerment"" or their blind love for Gal (even they don't compliment her acting) this film is not groundbreaking in the slighestI'd recommend everyone to watch the animated Wonder Woman films (Wonder Woman 2009 and Wonder Woman Bloodlines)","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

She also lacks in the musculature department, also not close to Sofia Boutella (Jayla in Star Wars Beyond), who has a magnificently athletic and muscular body and yet is still feminine and sexy. A cute face is not enough to be Wonder Woman; that mythical Amazon is a lot more than that. I notice, too, that when you compare Gadot's bikini pics with her in her Wonder Woman outfit, they pulled in her waist and pumped up her boobs to give her a sexier appearance, which she doesn't actually have. Body-wise, she's actually quite ordinary; there are many better built models & actresses than her around. Always makes me wonder how they pick these people, and what criterion they use. They're supposed to be getting a muscular, athletic person for this part, and they just got some ordinary model with a cute face - which strains the credibility of the character and therefore the believability of the character and the story. A similar mistake was made with ScarJo for the Major in GITS: beautiful girl, decent actress, physically terrific, but wrong for the part of Motoko because she's not Asian! In fact, she's as far away from Asia as you could get. It's like using Jackie Chan or Jet Li to play Robin Hood - both great physical characters, athletic, good actors, wrong for the part for obvious reasons. They could have done a better job for Wonder Woman than this Israeli actress;; for instance, check out Israeli model Bar Refaeli - much better in every category, physically; at least as beautiful, maybe more so, and a much better body. Don't know if she can act, but you get my point as to what Wonder Woman should look like. How the character physically appears is everything in this story; and Gal Gadot just doesn't measure up, and it's a shame that they have to doctor her physical appearance in the Wonder Woman outfit to give her credibility.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

It's like a 2 hour EEG in a darkened theater.Other than unmedicated people with epilepsy, I would recommend it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

"","","It's OK, just really long","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3866631/?ref_=tt_urv","alienf3tus","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur36745914/?ref_=tt_urv","24 November 2017","Want to preface this by saying that I'm not big on superhero movies. A lot of the time I see them as easy to make drivel that studios churn out for a quick cash grab, void of much, if any, substance. So Wonder Woman was pretty much an expected by-the- numbers action movie. Most of the film felt like padding scenes. The majority of the runtime seemed to be filled with pointless exposition scenes, resulting in the film as a whole to feel pretty long, and tedious to sit through at points. The setup especially took way too long to tell and suffered the most. The action scenes ranged from just OK to ridiculous. The music and few seconds of slo-mo were unfitting and really took me out of the movie. However, the one thing I absolutely loved about this was the set design and locations by Aline Bonetto. Each scene was incredible to look at and very believable. In the end, if I actually liked superhero movies (DC or Marvel) I probably would have liked this more. It was an OK film, there wasn't anything wrong with it, I just felt like integer gave me a reason to care.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

"","","Copies BETTER Movies but it's not bad... a shock for a DCEU film","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3721971/?ref_=tt_urv","DUKEJBM","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur2612373/?ref_=tt_urv","2 June 2017","I found this effort to be quite entertaining despite being unoriginal. It is interesting to break down the overall tones of the film itself because although predictable throughout, it manages to craft enough of its own spin. It really is entirely cobbled together using VERY familiar elements that we've already seen. I know her source material originated first but the movie borrows heavily from familiar narratives. The movie IS a mix/copy of Captain America: The First Avenger (HEAVILY), Thor (mythology/powers), the Hogan's Heroes TV show and a CGI video game boss battle cut scene. It's the last two elements that seriously detract from the overall rating. The conclusion literally played out like a cartoon and not a very good one. Also, the infiltration of the German party played out very ""sitcomish"" complete with everyone speaking English. Still, Gal Gadot captivated me as Wonder Woman and Chris Pine was amazing as Steve. They both elevate the overall material to be honest.Moving forward, the DCEU would be smart to focus more on Wonder Woman and less on the garbage we've already seen. The only negative I see is that they made her overwhelmingly powerful. That can be a huge problem in the future not only when facing enemies but with consistency. Even in this film it was all over the place in terms of her power. One scene she is straining to lift her own body weight and the next she literally lifts a tank over her head.","0 out of 5 found this helpful.
