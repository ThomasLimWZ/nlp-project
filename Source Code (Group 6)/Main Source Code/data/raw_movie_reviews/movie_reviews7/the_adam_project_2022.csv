Everybody's a critic and everyone thinks that their opinion matters. And it doesn't. Not one little bit. Mine included, so you can stop reading anytime you like...People are pissed at this movie the way they are pissed at every movie that isn't directed by Christopher Nolan and have a plot you need a PhD to understand. These people appear to have lost the ability to just...enjoy.What anybody who watched this movie - a movie about time travel starring Ryan Reynolds - was expecting when they threw a hissy fit is totally beyond me. Did they not know what was on offer? It kinda says that on the tin. Now, if that's not gonna appeal to you, move along. Nothing for you to see here. For the rest of us - you know, those of us who haven't forgotten how to enjoy stuff an don't require everything we see to be groundbreaking and profound - The Adam Project was a smart, touching and reasonably exciting Sci Fi romp that hit all the right notes and pushed all the right buttons. Recommended.","33 out of 39 found this helpful.

I definitely had a good time even if some intellectuals will say it sucks. I must admit that I'm a bit tired of Ryan Reynold, but on this one he is not as extra as usual - well, at least, sometimes - and he even gives a good performance.This film won't change the world, but the humour landed more than I was expecting and the familiar dynamic/drama worked pretty well for me. Yeah, the villains are unidimensional and the background story is kind of generic, but this delivers what it promises, being an inoffensive fun film, reminding a lot of what we had in the past decades.PS: Great soundtrack!","110 out of 194 found this helpful.

And thus, I needed no persuasion to sit down and watch what writers Jonathan Tropper, T. S. Nowlin, Jennifer Flackett and Mark Levin had in store with this movie.And honestly, then the movie was every bit as entertaining and enjoyable as anticipated. Which means that director Shawn Levy managed to do a great job at bringing the script and storyline to life on the screen in an enjoyable and entertaining manner.Sure, ""The Adam Project"" is the type of movie where you essentially just lean back, munch on the snacks and watch the movie. Yeah, it wasn't particularly a very cerebral movie, despite of it revolving around something as complex as time travel. But hey, it is a movie meant for entertainment after all, this wasn't exactly an exact science.Visually then ""The Adam Project"" is rather impressive. But of course, with a movie project such as this, the funding is large and very capable of sustaining great visuals. And a movie such as ""The Adam Project"" does need proper CGI effects to fully function as intended on the screen. And trust me, the effects served their purpose.""The Adam Project"" has a good cast ensemble, which funnily enough brought together four members of the Marvel CMU, a funny little detail. Especially since ""The Adam Project"" does poke fun at aforementioned MCU. The movie has the likes of Ryan Reynolds, Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldana and Jennifer Garner on the cast list to carry the movie, which they did quite well. In addition, the young actor Walker Scobell really managed to stand tall among such established performers.While ""The Adam Project"" certainly is a watchable and enjoyable movie, it hardly strikes me as a movie that I will be returning to watch a second time, as the storyline just didn't have all that much solid contents to it.My rating of ""The Adam Project"" lands on a six out of ten stars.","102 out of 200 found this helpful.

Some of these negative reviews on here really make me sad, because obviously the people writing don't want to have fun or are ""too cool"" for a feel good movie. It's a great family movie, drawing inspiration from a handful of classics before it such as Flight of the Navigator and Back to the Future but also keeping it fresh with great special effects and cinematography. It's also a tear jerker... and reminded me of how a lot of movies used to be made to trigger a positive emotional response, something that is missing completely from most modern cinema.A movie hasn't made me feel this way in a long time. I felt like a kid again watching it. I'm not ""too cool"" for this movie. It rocks. Great cinematography, acting, script, comedy and drama. It's a great all ages movie.

There is no way around it. And I know that there are many other films with the same amount of logic holes (and perhaps the same plot!) that are considered at least average, but those are older movies. If you clone a barely average old film now and all you have to add to it is Ryan Reynolds' jokes as an improvement, then you fail.Forget that time travel films are notoriously hard to have making sense: even in that very specific subgenre, this film is at the bottom of anything resembling reason. What you are left with are (very!) cheap video game like special effects, Reynolds' and the kid (he did a good work, BTW) spouting jokes and puns and guest star appearances from Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner and Zoe Saldana (they all have like a few minutes of screen time each, just to get a paycheck). Even the ""endearing"" part that people talk about is mostly nostalgia for better films from 30 years ago and nothing to do with the script.Bottom line: I like Ryan Reynolds, he is fun, but all of his movies have become the same thing with different backgrounds. They don't even make the effort to make it seem like they tried. With this in mind, I doubt even Deadpool 3 will be any different, which would be a terrible shame. Films like The Adam Project are a disgrace, a show of bad faith and lack of respect to viewers. At least Reynolds should know better.","412 out of 839 found this helpful.

You'd think I'd be better at it by now!!!""______________________________________________________If you're someone who's presently in the mood to take a -Welcome- Break from all the doom and gloom on the news right now and watch a movie that comes ""FULL-CIRCLE"" in the most Enthralling, Engaging, and indeed -{ Heartwarming }- of ways . . . Then I wish to -Wholeheartedly- recommend ""The Adam Project"", ( TAP for short ), to you. The only -Other- cinematic experience I've had where a film came Full-Circle in -Such- beautiful fashion, in -Recent- memory at least, would be the simply Fabulous ""SpiderMan: No Way Home"" ( ""SM-NWH"" ). It is a picture that literally ( And -Very- Cleverly ) ties up loose ends within the -{ Entire }- Spiderman CANON of films, from as far back as 2002. It also just happens to be the -Last- Massive Blockbuster that I reviewed ; before going on an -Entirely- unplanned, ( but -Incredibly- refreshing ) 'Extended 101-day hiatus from reviewing'.Ok, so if you thought that the 13 yr. Old ""Newcomer"" of said film, pint-sized thespian Walker Scobell was a tremendous -Dramatic- actor, well, then you'd only be -Half- right. The fact of the mater is... he's also a terrific -COMEDIC- talent, with seriously ""Impeccable"" timing, especially given that this is, get this ...his -{ First Ever }- movie or TV ( 'Feature' ) appearance. Factor Walker's ""Super-Fun"" performance in alongside a 'full spectrum' of absolute -{ ""POWERHOUSE!"" }- deliveries from the film's unequivocal ensemble principal cast of Protagonists ( Zoe Saldaña, Ryan Reynolds, Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner, ) . . . Then add in some absolutely -Fantastic- ( & truly state of the art ) CGI, a genuinely -Mindblowing- grand finale set piece ...and the kind of fight choreography that you really have to -See- ...to believe . . . & you have a seriously, seriously exciting picture, indeed.Not to mention FUNNY AS HELL!!! I really hadn't laughed so hard in a long time ; -since- ( about the 3rd time ) I watched SM-NWH, to be precise. On the downside, though . . . & if I'm to be 'painfully' honest . . . -Both- the Villain ( ...don't get me wrong, the person who plays the main 'baddie' is a Veteran performer ; I just felt like the Writing there could have been just that ""Little Bit Stronger""... ) -And- her 'ever loyal' henchman are a 'tad weak', as is the very title of the film, itself. Even something as ( relatively ) simple as ""FLASH-BACK-FORWARD"", would have been -{ Far }- catchier than its existing name, ( although I do think I sorta understand -Why- they called it what they did, for what it's worth ). It's for these two reasons -Alone- that I -Didn't- give it my trademark ""25/10"" ; reserved especially for movies That Move Me -{ VERY }- Deeply, as TAP ( ...quite obviously... ) -Did-.Summary: This is a picture that, ( among -several- other things ), pointedly asks the question: If you could -{ Somehow }- go back in time, & talk to your Younger-Self... ""WHAT'D YOU SAY?"" ...and in the most -Intriguing- of ways, at that. Furthermore, having lost my Dearly Beloved Father when I was -Just- 13, in a horrible, brutal car crash, TAP resonated with me PROFOUNDLY. It has some Genuinely ""TENDER"" Moments, & does a -Phenomenal- job of addressing the issue of 'Estranged Father-Son Relationships' the world over, but most especially in the USA ; ( where the film is also -Set- ) ; and where the issue is quite possibly now almost at epidemic levels, what with the country's sky-high divorce rate, separation rate, & just plain old 'Absentee Father-ism', in general. All said & done, the ""EVER-DYNAMIC! Duo"" of Actor Ryan Reynolds & Director Shawn Levy have well & truly ""Done it Again"". Although this -ISN'T- a Marvel movie, It -does- star a ""Handful Of Marvel's Best & Brightest"" and -is- ultimately, "" A ( not so ) little cinematic streaming MARVEL 🌠 "", in its 'Very Own Right'. Sadly, I'm not able to give TAP my 'Absoluuut-High-Score' ( as I explained a bit earlier ), but it -Still- earns a ""Majestic, Rock Solid 13 Marks Out Of 10 Marks"" from me . . .

It's like living with a urinal cake that yells at you""Shawn Levy's ""The Adam Project"" turned out exactly as I had imagined. It's fun, full of energy and has a rather powerful ground of emotions that hit you like a truck. Believe it or not, this specific aspect would have a greater say over everything else. It will depend upon how much you value the 'Humane' stuff; based on that, it will either make or break your experience and could modify the final takeaway as well.Speaking for myself, I'm a sensitive person; and these kinds of stuff make me emotional, and here is no exception. I just loved the dynamic shown here. The father & son alliance hasn't been explored enough in recent times, I'm delighted they did that in here and that too in the most adorable fashion possible. And yeah, the actors did their parts too.Say what you want, Ryan Reynolds has nailed it yet again. I know some part of the audience won't agree with my above statement. ""Ryan Reynolds getting repetitive"", ""He's playing himself"", ""He's doing the same thing over and over again""; now, I won't deem them as lies, as most of these statements do reflect the reality or at least some parts of it. But then again, as long as he's getting the job done, doing well on his part, I see nothing wrong in there.Besides, nobody would argue against the talent this man seems to possess. From his stellar dialogue deliveries to his perfect comic timings, No other actor could do those things in the way he does, he's one of a kind, he's unparalleled in this space. And I truly admire him for that, and you know what? I'm not at all apologetic while acknowledging the same.So, It seems we've finally concluded, this is the part where I'm supposed to tell you whether you should go to the film or not. Look, I loved Levy's previous work i.e. Free Guy; although that doesn't necessarily suggest I had higher expectations this time, on the contrary, I did know this would not be the same sort of experience, because of various reasons. All I can say is that, if you are here for nothing but the sole value of entertainment, congratulations, you have come to the right place. Or else, get yourself prepared for a tiny dose of disappointment!","55 out of 124 found this helpful.

Yes it is flawed at times, the latter half of the film never quite as strong as the first half, but it does really have its moments and strong qualities. Its cinematography is great, its very wholehearted message never taking a backseat, and it always seems to have a very clear visual style. All the actors are so much fun to watch throughout, yes Ryan Reynolds is as fun as ever on screen, but let's not forget the actor playing his younger self- Walker Scobell- who is easily the most charismatic kid actor i've seen in quite some time. Its plot is a bit scattered when it comes to the end, providing a strong start into storytelling- with a somewhat sloppy ending execution. Not to say that it was boring, but it just felt rather average and forgettable in comparison to the rest of the films charming nature and abilities- and felt like it could have been done a bit better have given more time. In the end, The Adam Project is a fun and sweet little adventure- that is bound to delight families everywhere. It's not as strong or great as the duo's last effort Free Guy but it's certainly enjoyable enough to give it a chance.My Rating: 7.4/10.","46 out of 102 found this helpful.

This film also whooshes you into some very realistic topics, too, like grieving for a loved one, being bullied by classmates and accepting who you are.The year is 2050 and time travel exists; however, it is proving to be too dangerous for humanity's own good. After time-traveler pilot Adam Reed (Ryan Reynolds) misses the destination of his mission, to land in 2018, and instead crash-lands in 2022, he is found by his 13-year-old self (Walker Scobell). Together, they embark on a mission to ""un-do"" time travel so they can fix the past to save the future of the world. But first, the Adams must learn how to get along with each other.The special effects are one of the most notable things about this movie. The wormholes have a mind-boggling appearance, and the ships are straight out of an alien planet. The sci-fi elements look so realistic - as realistic as those can be - that it gives the impression that the cinematographers used time travel themselves to capture these scenes. The overall storyline of the movie is creative, but it does not really have any unique plot twists nor is it fully developed. And as a result, this film comes off a little bland and seems to be missing something. The Adam Project includes some great actors besides Ryan Reynolds, including Jennifer Garner (Adam's mom). In Reynold's performance, you can really feel all his tension and childhood trauma built up, ready to burst. He also manages to make you laugh really hard. Jennifer Garner is the perfect fit for Adam's loving mother who's trying to keep it together as a single mom.This movie has great messages about never giving up and learning to live with your past. There is some profanity, intense fighting scenes, blood, and some adult jokes.I give The Adam Project 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 11 to 18, plus adults. This movie releases exclusively on Netflix on March 11, 2022. By Katherine S., KIDS FIRST!","29 out of 61 found this helpful.

The similar mannerisms between the older and younger Adam is well rehearsed, as is their sarcastic comebacks.Both characters have recent darkness in their lives, and even though the plot has nothing to do with them helping each other to get through their personal hardships, just being around each other helps them to a small degree of recovery. Meanwhile, bad guys from the future are trying to find the older Adam, while school bullies enjoy beating up the younger Adam.A good balance of comedy and fight/flight scenes. There's some sci-fi knowledge about time travel required to understand a few later parts, and the futuristic weapons are very cool (especially the lightsaber that ""isn't a lightsaber."").But, the second half of the movie (when the older and younger Adam travel together to yet another point in time) doesn't make much sense. There's no logical reason for why the younger Adam has to travel through time, nor why he is even still in the movie (his lines of dialog likewise become nonessential, which is a shame.).I also didn't care much for the primary villain: whom is a warm, close family friend in the past, but -- in just three years -- inexplicitly becomes a homicidal introvert fueled by personal greed? (Huh?! Why?) Plus, the breaking into a scientific research facility which apparently has zero employees: no minimum-wage security guards, maintenance or landscapers anywhere to be seen ... it must have been a nonworking Saturday (even though they just left a crowded college campus with active classes going on?!).I don't want to give anything more away than this because it's worth watching.

It doesn't bring anything new to the table, not in the storytelling department, nor the action and time travel.As far as time travel movies go, this is the most basic and barebone plot. I gave The Tomorrow War a 4, because it had many plot holes and it was too long and all that, I already talked about them in a review of it, but even that movie had a better time travel plot and explanation than this.But this movie still has it's charm with the likable characters and good actors. Ryan Reynold is always great and he's great in this too, but I can't really say that this is any different than all the characters he played before. At least he's got more emotional scenes to play in this than his other movies, but the quips are still there.And there are some chuckle-worthy scenes in this too. So it's not insultingly bad or anything, it's just that this movie probably should've come out in 2099 or something.Shawn Levi did a good job with Free Guy, but this is a step backward for him. One thing I noticed in this that feels like was influenced by Free Guy, is that it relies on pop culture references to make ""comedy"" and it feels like a low-hanging fruit and too Free Guy-y, especially with Deadpool as the lead.The CGI is surprisingly really good, until you get to the part where the bad guy is visiting her young self. It's just uncanny and jarring. Like couldn't they find a younger woman that resembled the actress instead of whatever that was? I would've been fine if they weren't 100% a match, and I'm sure it would've cost less.Anyway, everything in this movie is just basic, from the plot to the storytelling and the action and characters. Even though the actors did their best, the emotional connection wasn't there for the audience. You know why? Because it felt like I'm watching a sequel or a season finale of a show, rather than a standalone movie.You can also nitpick the sht out of this movie. The main baddie also has one of the most ridiculous and laughable deaths I've ever seen.All in all, it's just generic and clichéd in every way and I wouldn't've recommended watching if it was in theaters. But since it's on streaming and you probably already have an account, I'd say give it go when you don't have anything else to do or watch and just want to kill 1:30 hour of your time. Your kids might enjoy them way more than you.","49 out of 108 found this helpful.

I truly loved it, it felt like a modern approach to an 80s sci-fi family film such as ""ET"", ""The Last Starfighter"" and ""Back to the Future"". Shawn Levy captures that spirit so well, and while he doesn't completely reinvent the wheel, he infuses this film with a lot of heart and some great entertainment value. It's a film that would make Spielberg proud, so deep in its veins is the essence of vintage Amblin. I like how while Levy used these comfortable retro elements he also did add in more modern sensibilities and gave it a futuristic feel, he makes it it's own thing while reminding us of movies we love. And oh boy, do I ever love Shawn Levy and Ryan Reynolds teaming up! First ""Free Guy"" (which I loved) and now this (which I love even more)! Ryan Reynolds is in his best form here, much like in ""Free Guy"" this is his best work outside of ""Deadpool"". What truly surprised me was that we got two Reynolds performances in this - one from Reynolds himself and one from young Walker Scobell who was truly incredible here! He matched Reynolds' personality and comedic style so well, and really held his own against Reynolds like a seasoned comedic actor! Their banter was so much fun, and Scobell's delivery felt exactly like Reynolds. Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner and Zoe Saldaña were also excellent and helped bring about some perfect emotional moments. I loved the chemistry between the cast - it couldn't have been better! While this isn't a great ""film"" by technical standards it's just so enjoyable and fun, it's all around good! It's so funny, has some great action, and even has some nice emotional moments that had me tearing up! This film emotionally resonates on a level Hollywood has been trying to return to for years, it's so well handled! It's thoughtful, witty and delightful, just such a wholesome and enjoyable film! I also loved the soundtrack, it had some great 80s songs mixed in! This movie was such a good time, it tells such a heartfelt and sweet story that I had so much fun with! It's truly better than most Netflix movies (it deserves so much more than Netflix... it should be a theatrical one!), and I would highly recommend checking it out! It's super entertaining, charming and has loads of spirit and heart! Trust me, you'll love it!","91 out of 157 found this helpful.

That other horrible netflix movie he was in with the Rock, was Deadpool rated PG-13. It now is so boring, unimaginative, repetitive and flavorless (deadpool is only good at charicatural rated-R level bordering on NC-17 ) + the scripts and stories he chooses feel like recycled stories: let's take 20% this movie, 30% that movie and 50% this other movie, add the worst cheesiest dialogue ever, a soundtrack of ""hip"" retro songs à la ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" and voila!It's like Chris Pratt and Ryan Reynolds are now competing to see who can be the most repetitive snarky character in every movie.

The actor-director duo imbibe a run-of-the-mill storyline with enough wit and soul to deliver a satisfying narrative that makes for a perfect weekend watch.Reynolds plays a renegade fighter pilot from the year 2050, who is forced to travel back in time to correct the evil machinations of a corporation hell bent on using time travel for their own selfish gains. It is here that he runs into a younger, 12-year-version of himself (played by an excellent Walker Scobell) and how the unlikely pairing tackle the enormous odd stacked up against them forms the rest of the story. While the plotline or the CGI offer nothing new, the chemistry between Reynolds and the young Scobell will have you guffawing from the get-go and with a focus on relationships and family bonds, leave you with a lump in your throat by the climax as well.Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner are such fine actors that they create a lasting impression in your mind despite the limited time they are on screen. Zoe Saldaña is also in terrific form as Reynolds' lady love, performing the action as well as the comedy with commensurate ease while Catherine Keener offers up a chilling and calculating antagonist.""The Adam Project"" delivers a fun experience without having to stretch your brain cells too much and is the perfect blend of sharp wit, physical comedy and soulful family drama that will keep you engaged.

The movie solves the question we all ask ourselves, what would we tell our loved ones if we had one more chance to see them. The time travel and action scenes just push the story so we get the answer to those questions. The action is bland, and sometimes predictable, but when the focus is the family is when the movie shines. The scene with Jennifer Gardner and Ryan Reynolds talking in a bar is particularly memorable.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

"7","/10","A Project of Comedy And Fast Laughs, With Other Elements Being Outdated","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7944775/?ref_=tt_urv","rgkarim","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur25226117/?ref_=tt_urv","12 March 2022","LIKES:Pacing: It's not a slow movie at all, and for much of the film it holds your attention between action, comedy, and story to be a fun adventure. You dive right into the film, get right into the chaos at hand, and maintain this brisk pace all the way to the final closing minutes of the film. As such, this pace should keep attention of ages all throughout the spectrum, to help this simple tale appeal to many.The Action: It's not the best blockbuster busting I've seen, but I have to admit the sequences in this film are very fun and decent given what I've seen lately in movies. The Adam Project has a little variety for the action fans involving things like: gunplay, sword combat, hand to hand fighting, and a few chases to get the blood running. While not the most realistic looking at times, it does a great job of adding the Ryan Reynolds/Sci-Fi flair that is fun to watch and fitting to the story. With homages to a variety of media, the movie does well with the material and manages to add elements like a John Wick style shoot out, a bow staff fighting spectacle of comedic proportions, and a little Star Wars like speeder moments that are fun to watch. All in all, the Adam Project does well integrating the action within the grand plan, and prevents it from consuming the entire movie.The Plot: It's a very predictable plot, but the movie manages to put some surprising emotion into the film that is primarily action/adventure genre. There are plenty of touching lessons in this movie, and to have the characters dive a little more into the vulnerable sides that aren't just physical weaknesses is quite impressive. No political idealism and agenda stuff in this film, at least to eye-rolling moments, just relatable issues twisted into a corny science-fiction plot that manages to pull on some strings. Throw in making the realistic plot feel approachable and not too mind bending or convoluted, and you again get a welcoming story to tie the movie together in a fun package.The Acting: While there is no life changing roles or Oscar blow out performances, it does not mean we don't have a great performance to make the characters come to life. Ruffalo's part is much like what we get in those deeper Marvel moments, a blend of comedy and drama that works so well with the cast collected. He's a great touch to the movie in the later acts and has great chemistry with the cast set before him as the moral obligations really start to flash up. Scobell is a fantastic young actor, who takes the kid role and works so well to make a younger character that did not annoy me as some roles take. His emotional control is already pretty stellar, both looks and voice delivery being a sound performance that shows promise for more complicated roles. However, his big nod goes to his imitation of Reynolds, really making me feel that we had a younger Ryan Reynolds in our midst and suggesting another comedic champion in our midst. As for Reynolds, the man knows his role and he nails it perfectly to give you pretty much the same merc with a mouth you have come to expect. It's in your face, comedy that continues to pound you with the writing loaded into this movie, and if you enjoy it, then you will love what Reynolds has done. Oh sure, there is some heartwarming moments and times where he pulls his serious face to be touching, but for the most part, he's the clown many have come to love. Of course, the chemistry is great and there are a bunch of other actors that get their props, but overall, the chemistry of this group is fun and impressive to enjoy.The Comedy: The selling point is of course the comedy being a Ryan Reynolds' movie. The Adam Project has plenty of jokes to get you through the two-hour run time this movie has with it. I believe the writing is the key to this, plenty of jokes and sarcastic punches to have you laughing through the movie and enjoying the characters snarky natures. And yet, Reynolds continues to just deliver his performance to that skill level we all know and love. While not the most diverse of the joking tactics, The Adam Project does not pull any punches for complex or dry humor, merely just bashing jokes tirelessly to tickle our funny bone and be fun, fun, fun. If you enjoy movies like Deadpool, Free Guy, and The Change up, then this movie is for you.DISLIIKES:The Predictability: It's hard for this not to be the case, but the story does have very little in terms of advanced plot telling dynamics, or a meaningful twist. The fun helps dilute this, but the predictability is certainly a weakness for me when you have potential to really mix up some things in this science fiction medium with lots of avenues to cross into surprising territory. If you don't care for twists, then this won't be an issue, but for those needing a little more spice to their movies... well you might be disappointed.A Little More Action Finesse: When the action starts up, it's awesome, fun, and full of character that really ties lots of movie together. And yet... the scenes lose their adrenaline rush too soon for me, leaving me wanting a little more pizazz to take these scenes to the full potential. A little more stakes to the mix would be nice, but perhaps making most of the ""advanced"" group not incompetent and giving them a little more skill. It could have helped to add a little more complexity to the mix too, once again working to make a few scenes that stick with us for the high-quality blasting fest that other movies have done well. Not the weakest action films, but there is certainly room for improvement though to assist with delivering the full potential.Comedy Too Much? I had a lot of fun with the humor, but like many of these films, is a bit too in your face for my liking, given the balance we had in Free Guy. The Adam Project with not one but too Reynolds' characters that try to cram jokes into every second gets a little too much for my liking that gets in the way of the other qualities this film had for it. I liked the comedy at times, but there were other potential moments of emotion, edge, and character usage that I feel were washed away by the humor factor that came in. Even the touching moment with Ruffalo gets a bit washed away in name of comedy, so perhaps a bit more balance could have gone a long way.More Character Usage: For quite the cast assembled, I can't say they did the best balancing all the characters in the movie that suggested we would get more interaction with them, then what was granted. Several characters get surprisingly shelved in this movie, limiting their involvement, their chemistry, their worth to the plot all about time travel and correcting mistakes. Given how much of the Sci-fi elements they were referencing, I had expected a little more time with some of the bigger female leads, helping establish character and plot points. However, to really flesh it out the way they wanted to, I feel this movie needed another sequel or a mini-series to really accomplish the goal. As such, this probably my biggest flaw with the movie, a generic use of characters that don't quite have the full bite we could have gotten given the talent they've shown in the past. I won't mention the full names to not put any fears or spoilers in, but there was more to do with these characters that may be a bit more irritating to some of the group going to watch it.The VERDICT:The Adam Project is certainly ambitious in trying to tie a lot of things together for a limited two-hour movie. For me, this movie did accomplish a lot of things for a streaming movie including being fun, having a lot of great humor delivered by actors who are strong in this field, while also giving us some levels to the comedy characters. I must say that I did enjoy the acting, though there is more to accomplish, and the jokes were a bit tiring to be honest when they got in the way of others things. However, the pace allows for plenty of time to enjoy some of the bigger characters and attempts at a deeper story. Still, the budget of Netflix and the goal to put out a movie a week still took away from something that could have been much better if there was a little better time management and focus on the full story than belting out quips and sarcastic comments left and right. My score for the Adam Project is:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0.","16 out of 36 found this helpful.

It's vaguely reminicent of films such as ""The Last Starfighter"", ""Flight of the Navigator"" and ""The Time-Travellers Wife"". It's a sort of amalgam of films like that; an agreeable amalgam.In the end, this film overdoes itself. Unfortunately it decends into silliness. It overdoes the pathos as well. It's a shame - if it could keep up the high standards it sets at times it would have been really quite good.Reynolds has a suitable role and script, and the boy who plays young Adam is good - I would have liked for him to have a slightly stronger part.

The Adam Project centres on the time-traveling theme as a ""Big"" Adam Reed crash-lands in 2022 and teams up with ""Young"" Adam Reed to save the future. Shawn Levy's trending new film on Netflix may be distracting, amusing and delightful for so many, but it feels like a big wasted mess that doesn't pull off its intended punch.Despite the arguably dull and flat pacing consuming the majority of the film's runtime, The Adam Project is commonly grasping and there's no doubt that it won't entertain you for a period of time. The writing offers just as much jokes as the execution offers sci-fi action sequences. Surprisingly, there's also a nice touch of emotion during the moments when the imperfectly written story falls onto the grief over the death of the lead characters' father.If you're really into Ryan Reynolds, there's no doubt you'll love his screen time during this movie, however, he unfortunately can't make up for the frequently poor writing. Once the film's started, it's feels very drowsy and unwatchable, leaving you waiting and waiting for the end. It's not overlong or slow, but this is the kind of movie you'll only watch once and then immediately forget. Shawn Levy can do better than this.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.","15 out of 35 found this helpful.

Names like Marc Ruffalo, Jennifer Gardner and Zoe Saldana seem to come and go from the flick like overblown cameos. None of them stuck around long enough for me to fully grasps their character. Not even Cathleen Kenner who did double duty as the villain thanks to good old CGI.No this was the Ryan Reynolds show and it was not even that good of an episode. Maybe it was because he had to share the screen with a little kid, I don't know but I've seen Reynolds be more magical in worse movies (I'm thinking 6 Underground).The pace of the movie was kinda fast. It felt like they were trying to fit a lot of story into a small amount of time, but the problem with that was it was not a lot of story, and there was plenty of time to tell it. It's interesting how you can watch a movie and not understand why certain characters cannot see the plot unravel in front of them. Then you watch a film like the Adam Project in which the characters do understand what's going on instantly, and you realize that happen far too fast.To note, there are certain writers in Hollywood (like the now canceled I believe, Joss Whedon) who are geeky enough to pull this off, but its not happening here.I will say I did not dislike the movie. I keep thinking that the movie could have been almost as good as the theatrical release, Uncharted and could have given that film a run for its money if it was not released on Netflix. Unless the reason why its on Netflix is because they realized quick that this flick was that mediocre, although I've seen movies no where near this good make it to be big screen.I liked it but for all that went into it, it could have been better, especially in the genre of time travel.","34 out of 94 found this helpful.

S. Nowlin, Jennifer Flackett, and Mark Levin. The cast has Ryan Reynolds as Adam Reed, a time pilot who risks his life to try and uncover the truth behind his wife's disappearance. But also names like Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner, Walker Scobell, Catherine Keener and Zoe Saldaña in important roles, with Ryan Reynolds serving as a producer for the film. The dialogue are actually great and made for Reynolds, the overall a story surprised me in how good it actually ended up being. But it's still a popcorn and a Ryan Reynolds movie with some great sci-fi elements. Result? A great and entertaining movie that is certain to make you smile and entertained.A time-traveling pilot teams up with his younger self and his late father to come to terms with his past while saving the future.The Adam Project is fun and overall a great addition to Ryan Reynolds Filmography but if you're looking for something deep and a story that you haven't really seen before, this isn't it, it's like Back to the Future meets a couple of other sci-fi films. You clearly see the inspiration the writers took, for good and bad, but the film left me satisfied. How come this film works so well? I actually think it's because of Ryan Reynolds and the child actor Walker Scobell who portrays the child version of Adam Reed, the duo has such great chemistry and their acting is also quite good. The other actors are also good in this film. The pacing is great and so is the cinematography, but one of my favorite parts of the movie are the direction from Shawn Levy and Ryan Reynolds as the lead, Rob Simonsen's musical score is fantastic and fitting so well with the science fiction genre. The visual effects and the action sequences are actually really good, great even, they're choreographed well. But the film has its flaws but overall an entertaining movie. I do think the film's last act didn't really hold up, I think it could have been written better and shouldn't have been that predictable. Still a good ending to a good film.","5 out of 9 found this helpful.

My only gripe being that with the short time that one has (with so much plot), much of the emotional aspect of the film has been watered down by simply how little time they gave for it to blossom.Overall, a great film, but not one for the time travel nerds, or those looking for a real good bittersweet.","12 out of 28 found this helpful.

Also a big fan of Ryan Reynolds and Mark Ruffalo so it went hand in hand really. And I have to say I enjoyed this film, for someone that isn't huge on sci-fi as well, I was entertained throughout.Something that always bugs me is child actors/characters, especially when they are one of the main ones (I get PTSD from war of the worlds), but this movie was good. Really made the kid likeable and was someone you could really get behind throughout.Few negatives for me to get off my chest. The ""villain"" of the plot I thought was really underdone, they could have really done more and added more depth to them. It's sort of set out as ""this is the bad one, end of"".I thought the ending as well was a little shorter if anything. Again, wish there was just a little more depth involved with the ending. Was a very quick ""end battle"".But overall, they don't disrupt the fun of this movie. It's got some good action scenes, it's funny in parts and it's just an entertaining watch. I'd say this is slightly more serious Ryan Reynolds in this so if you aren't that huge on his humour then you're more in luck. He definitely brings his charm and humour into this (and played the part really well), but it's not overdone at all and doesn't feel like a comedy. But yeah, it's a fun little film that I believe is well worth a watch! It's likely not going to blow you away or anything, but it's entertaining and that's what films should be. 7/10 from me here, I'd recommend.","13 out of 31 found this helpful.

Time travel gets weird solutions? That's fine. Always happens. However, some of the other scientific stuff that have impact on character decisions or the outcomes of fight scenes are just really silly.The other thing - the classic ""issues with my father"" trope every super hero movie ever had is there throughout the film. Get over it! Today's middle aged guys are much more involved with their families. Hey, I'm a middle aged guy - the only thing I do mostly right is being a family man.Also, the main female roles are somewhat lacking in terms of depth... three main characters played by great actresses but they were mainly given cliche roles and lines. If the movie passes the Bechdel test - it does it only by mistake. Not saying I notice it every time I watch a movie but here the female roles were supposed to be big yet their presence feels so limited.Should you watch it? Yes. It's really enjoyable just not great, or even good, it's ""nice"".","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The story is alright, the time travel theories/consecuences are kinda poorly explained but it's still entertaining.The only thing that I find midly annoying is that, as any other Ran Reynolds mvoie, they are driven by his hrisma, sense of humor nd how good he know to make puns. Don't get me wrong, I like him, he's a good actor, but I think Hollywood is wasting his acting skill by just letting him play himself. Which is good at some poits, but lately all of his movies are like that, so they feel a little like clones.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

The Adam Project makes no exception, and this time he is the adult version of Adam.We go back to the year 2022. Adam is a bullied 12 year old kid with a big mouth. His mom is Jennifer Garner, and his dad is Mark Ruffalo, died 1 year ago. He lives in a house in the middle of a CGI forest. Why? For plot conveniences, I guess. That's the time where Reynolds joins in, as Adam from the future.Time travel exists, and conflicts are created because of it. It's up to little and big Adam to save the day through CGI obstacles, which means flying laughable-looking jets and having fights with lightsabers.This kind of movie is very easy to enjoy, but doesn't mean it should be lazy. Director Shawn Levy (also having directed Free Guy) makes this movie with a lot of energy, just like Reynolds, but the script is lazy, filled with plot conveniences and ridiculous dialogue.The villain(s) are the lamest there ever is, with no backstory whatsoever, although even if they have one I wouldn't care more either. The movie is filled with CGI and green screen everywhere, and it got to a point where it jsut looks like Spy Kids in the third act.The movie is basically one giant animated film (Why isn't it one? It would work better that way). It uses all the likability from the stacked cast to make people think a movie being entertaining is enough. The Adam Project needs to be more.","31 out of 75 found this helpful.

The plot of the movie was simple but interesting enough to be followed easily without any unnecessary information to make it boring.

From when I saw the trailer I was hookedThe Good- This is a good old-fashioned sci-fi adventure. The movie very much has deep emotions and about remembering those loved ones which absolutely resonates with me in what I have gone through in my personal life in the last 3 months and really let me reflect on my memories with lost loved ones (in particularly my dad who died just before Christmas). It has everything you would want from a time travel film. It has everything you would want from a modern day film while also having a bit of an 80s feeling to it (although it is not a film that I could see being released in the 80s). Ryan Reynolds is just doing what Ryan Reynolds does and I love it. As an adventure film there is plenty of action throughout the film.The Bad- There are a few sub plots here that don't quite work. For example the relationship with Ryan Reynolds and Zoe Saldana feels like in an earlier version of the script it had a bigger part in the story and now it's just feels like it's just there and doesn't have any real significance.It's a movie that I had fun with. I liked it. It wasn't amazing but it wasn't bad. It laugh and it played with my emotions. If you like sci-fi actions with emotion this is a movie you will enjoy a good bit. Overall I'm going to give 'The Adam Project' a 7/10. And if you liked the trailers you should definitely go and check it out.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

He really has talent. Some of the cgi is a bit meh, but I wasn't bothered except for the deaging of one character that really just gave me uncanny valley feelings, I wish they'd just cast one actor for the younger version and one for the older version.

Adam (Ryan Reynolds) travels in time to look for his wife Laura (Zoe Saldana), and he appears in 2022 in where he finds the 12 year old Adam. During this, Maya Sorian (Catherine Keener) appears and battles against the old Adam and Laura. After this, both Adams decide to travel time in where his father was alive in order to destroy the time travel machine, which his father, (Mark Ruffalo) has created.Honestly, the film was entertaining, but although this I would not recommend it. It's good but it leaves out many things without being explained, or there are things that just don't make sense, it ends up being farcical.The battles are very unreal and don't generate anything, no adrenaline, no emotion, nothing. Don't expect this film to be catchy. Most of the scenes are short, it twists and turns at a whiplash speed. Cast is really good but is disregarded because of the poor plot of the film. There is a turmoil of events that makes the entire movie to be a mess.Although my critics, I will not lie, some parts were emotional. Just as when the old Adam gives some lessons about his treatment towards his mother. As well as all the mourning of the father. It's interesting the relation between the two Adams and how they give advice to each other.If you decide to watch the film, don't expect too much about it. And try not to give too much attention to each minimum detail of each scene.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

In 2022, the twelve-year-old boy Adam Reed (Walker Scobell) lives with his mother Ellie (Jennifer Garner) and misses his beloved father, the scientist Louis Reed (Mark Ruffalo), who has recently died. While his mother is working, Adam finds the pilot in the garage and soon he learns that the pilot is himself in 2050. Further, he intended to jump to 2018 to save his wife, Laura (Zoe Saldaña), who apparently died while investigating a confidential subject. The old Adam needs Adam to use his DNA to activate his jet plane since he is wounded, but is located by his enemies, Maya Sorian (Catherine Keener) and Christos (Alex Mallari Jr.). Out of the blue, they are saved by Laura, and flee to a house by the sea. She tells them that they must return to 2018 to meet Louis Reed and destroy his experimental time machine since Maya is returning to 2018 to provide information to herself to dominate the world in the future. The problem is that Maya Sorian is Louis' sponsor, partner and friend, and they have to convince him that she is a menace to the world.""The Adam Project"" is an enjoyable Netflix's film, with great cast and special effects, but a reasonable story. Walker Scobell is a promising actor, and the movie has names such as Ryan Reynolds, Jennifer Garner, Mark Ruffalo, Catherine Keener and Zoe Saldaña, among others in the cast. There are many paradoxes for a time traveling movie, but if you shut down your brain and disregard paradoxes, you will certainly enjoy the entertainment. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""O Projeto Adams"" (""The Adam Project"")","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

The whole plot with villain and villain herself is just boring and makes no sense to me (i can't say what exactly, because i want it to be spoiler free).

Welp, that was right on the mark.What we have is a slight rip off of Disney's ""The Kid"" concept where the older protagonist encounters his annoying younger, smart-aleck self...while also tossing in a time-travel element to the plot just to shake things up a bit. Ditch any form of plausibility and you might enjoy the ride. However for me, seeing this once was enough. The initial first act managed to hold my attention, even though I found the child-version of RR to be an irritating little snot. I know that character element was purposely woven into the film as a plot device, but the little kid still got on my nerves after a while. I got the feeling he was trying too hard. Then, of course, there was Catherine Keener's selection to play the antagonist, which...I'm sorry but I really couldn't buy. Perhaps she's been typecast in my mind as the sweet and mellow-like mom-next-door, so the sultry, evil Dr. No transformation here just didn't ring true to me. And even RR's supposed relationship with Zoe Saldana in the film just seemed forced. I couldn't swallow any of the chemistry between them. Their affection seemed tacked on rather than natural.All in all, take the movie at face value and don't try to dissect it on too many levels. At the end of the day, it's a kid's film, and I'm sure that's exactly who the producers intentionally targeted.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

It isn't anything special as the film is missing a certain sort of spark to it, though the story is fun and allows for some interesting and rather sweet scenes; the latter is particularly true for the conclusion, which is well produced.Reynolds himself is solid in the lead role, his performance is more serious than funny but there are still a fair amount of amusing moments for him across the 100 or so minutes. Walker Scobell gives a good showing behind the main man, his comedic timing in the first few scenes really does mirror Reynolds'.Elsewhere on the cast, Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldaña and Jennifer Garner are decent. I will say that I found the antagonists a bit weak in this, I wasn't all that interested in them or their side of the plot.

The bad ones rely mostly on the technical part of the story like this one. Something felt off the whole time so I paused at the midpoint of the movie and asked my partner if they knew what the characters objectives were. Neither of us had a clue.Good time travel movies aren't about the time travel. They are about people. I had no idea who these characters were except for stunt casted famous people.I like giving the films I'm supposed to watch a try every once in a while. They should have put their advertising budget into the script writing. But then again, they wouldn't be green lit for the next populist film so they have to rely on bells and whistles. Even Ryan Reynold charm was not enough to keep me.","19 out of 45 found this helpful.

1. CGI
2. Sound effects
3. The fighter jets' fight on Earth (I love it that sometimes when they fly by they make sounds similar to Star Wars TIE fighters)
4. The jokes were good actually, nothing cliche, all pretty original material.5. Actors actually did pretty amazing job with the script they were given. (except Sorian)
6. Great time waster, wasn't bored even for a minute, time passes very fast with this movie.What was BAD:
1. Plot holes and especially Time Travel plot holes!2. Script development is pretty pretty childish, if I was 10-13y old this movie would be 9/10 for me.3. The bad guys in the metal suits are just as worse as Imperial Stormtroopers. They are just like an annoying background, helpless and easy dying and never causing any real damage 😅
4. The main antagonist is like...not very smart, not very determined, makes questionable moves. Her methods are best suited for a child movie. I mean...even the actress playing her...I just can't take her as evil. It's like an average business woman in her 50s who decides to take over the world, yey.This movie could have been something really big, it just needed a more mature script, a deeper one, a more engaging one.It's just feels shallow and rushed. My analytical side, my scientific side, my mature side, they all were quite disappointed.My childish side, my big boom effects side, my I don't care whatever side were super happy!","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I enjoyed it. It was fun on a surface level. Secondly, technically speaking, it sucked. Plot holes galore, CGI was mediocre in most of it, the idea was for sure unoriginal, but it's kind of just one of those movies where you're just supposed to sit down and enjoy everything on a surface level. Watching it, I did enjoy the movie, but only because of certain characters' actions or lines by themselves. The actual plot of ""omg time travel is ruining the world, evil character is causing it, let's go save everyone"" doesn't really matter as much as what the individual characters are doing, because the plot is overused, inconsistent, and poorly set up. The movie had some really cute moments and messages, was pretty amusing overall, and I was glad to see that the parent figures weren't just some dumb people who didn't understand and only got in the way, but were actually kind of realistic and relatable (as average movie characters can get).If you start questioning the plot at all, it all falls apart. The movie directly contradicts itself a bunch of times. But Ryan Reynolds is just really good at playing a character that consistently amuses you throughout the movie until it ends, and the kid playing his past self was really good at matching his energy. The emotional parts are just emotional enough to have you kind of invested in the characters and what happens, but not so much that you start digging really deep or, again, thinking more than surface level.The movie wasn't a masterpiece, I don't think it'd be anyone's favourite, but it's just a fun and enjoyable film. I really liked it.I do think it's interesting that they named a couple famous people who were hardly in the film at all as if they were a large part of it, and how (probably due to covid) there seemed to be hardly any actors. Like, usually there are quite a few scenes where a large group of people are together in relatively close groups, either in the background or in the main focus of the scenes, but there just wasn't in this film. Even most of the scenes where they had a larger group of people, they were basically all spaced out for most of it. I'm glad they stayed safe if Covid is why, but it's just kinda funny.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

But please stop with the god awful CGI-attempt on human faces.It was dreadful 2 decades ago and still is. I would have happily given a 9 if it wasn't for being constantly jarred away from the story with one character's awful computerised face.Watch it in profile shots, her nose actually keeps changing shape! Also irked me that whoever was wearing the green suit, has a smaller skull than the actor she was supposed to be a younger version of. Clearly visible in the side by side shot.I normally don't like kids in movies, but this one was great. He had clearly studied Ryan intensely, or rehearsed scenes together, as I could easily believe it was a young Ryan most of the time.Fun film, but like most time travel movies, best turn your brain to the entertainment setting and don't dissect the science too hard.9/10 with -1 for the horrific CGI face.","7 out of 19 found this helpful.

It definitely feels like a mismash of various other films like Star Wars, Star Trek, Frequency etc and while it can be fun at times, it never really feels like it's own thing.I don't care whether or not ""the science"" of the film makes sense. Suspension of disbelief and all that. And it was easy to follow along. My complaint storywise is I felt that outside the 2 Adam's and their dad played by Mark Ruffalo, none of the other characters had much development. Even the villain just kind of felt like a generic villain but with no build up. I think it would have helped introducing her to the audience in 2022 first or at least earlier in the film. But like Jennifer Garner doesn't really get much to do. Zoe Saldana is in the film maybe 15 min. And while she does have 2 action scenes, she doesn't really do anything else except deliver some exposition and serve as a way to flesh out Ryan Reynold's version of Adam more. I mean Mark Ruffalo isn't in a lot of the movie. He's only in the third act, but his character is so much more important and feels self actualized than the rest of the supporting cast.It is a bit predictable at times. But it is also fun and there's some cool special effects and action sequences with a couple of touching scenes thrown in. It didn't make me cry, so it didn't fully get me. But I still think it's overall a decent family flick. Emphasis on family.","4 out of 9 found this helpful.

Has he ever directed anything that was award-worthy? No, but the majority of the time his movies either tug at my heartstrings (which I'm always up for) or at the very least, get a laugh out of me. Whether you're talking about his work on Real Steel or even as far back as Big Fat Liar, I've always been impressed. Having recently done Free Guy, which I quite enjoyed, I was very much looking forward to a sci-fi outing with him teaming up once again with Ryan Reynolds. While this film is far from perfect, Netflix's release of The Adam Project is heartwarming and a sheer joy to watch.Adam, a young, confident boy who just can't seem to keep from either getting bullied or suspended from school, receives a major wake-up call when himself from the future shows up. Needing to work together to stop an impending threat, as well as try and prevent things that may happen in the future, this film becomes a big, fun joy ride. With that said, the story of this film isn't even what hooked me. The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Walker Scobell was off the charts amazing. The way he portrays a younger version of Reynolds was terrific. Even down to how Reynolds interacts with their mother was incredibly good. There are multiple emotional scenes that had me wanting even more.If I had to complain about something, this film started to lose me was in the third act. When the film really dives into the reasoning behind why Adam has travelled back in time, the story begins to feel jumbled and almost too simplistic. There were multiple times when I found myself wishing it was going somewhere different. The way the film concludes is simple, confusing, and satisfying all at once. If it wasn't for the messiness of where it all goes and how it all concludes, I may have been raving about how much I loved it.To be completely truthful, I was in love with the first 30 minutes of The Adam Project. The character development, along with the performances (which also lasts throughout the film) and the sense of awe and wonder all worked for me. It really just came down to the fact that it left a little to be desired for me. Shawn Levy proves once again that he works very well with actors and this brought me back to the early 2000s in terms of sci-fi, family-friendly storytelling. I had a blast watching this film even though I have a major complaint about it. I recommend checking out The Adam Project, now streaming on Netflix.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

The premise of the film sees a time traveller having to team up with his younger self in order to create a better future.Main Character
Ryan Reynolds plays the lead character Adam and he is exactly what you expect and I actually think it really worked for this film. I think Reynolds flourishes when he is just being himself and this film is one of those, he is funny, charming and actually quite heartfelt as the older version of Adam. Youngster Walker Scobell plays the younger version of Adam and he was great and I think the future is very bright for him. The chemistry between Reynolds and him really carries this film and their performances are quite joyful to watch.Supporting Characters
Mark Ruffalo & Jennifer Garner play the parents of Adam and I really liked watching them. They just felt like really fun parents, seeing these top class performers having plenty of fun with their roles but also have depth in their characters makes them a great addition to this film. Zoe Saldana has a smaller role here but it was really impactful, she is also really fun on screen and adds some life to the film when it really needs it. But I must admit, I wasn't a huge fan of Catherine Keener as the villain, she was just pretty cliché and dull which is completely in contrast to the rest of the film and made it feel awkward and out of place.Story
The story is fun, seeing two versions of the same character interacting does provide some great entertainment and the film keeps you invested throughout. There are thoughtful character moments and development which is more then I expected from this film. But this film just struggles with the fact that it feels a bit cliché with its storytelling, we have seen so many time travel films by now that it doesn't bring that much new to the table.Script
The script is pretty good, there is plenty of humour and for the most part it delivers and had me chuckling throughout. But as I mentioned before, there was a surprising amount of heart and drama too which rose this above just an average comedy. Though, this film struggles with exposition dumps and it wasn't handled in a very clever way and I think that held the film back, especially in the first act.Style
The film also looks great, the style of the film is fun and exciting. The action scenes are well crafted and the future technology does enough to make it feel unique and adds plenty to this overall product. But the film does have a little bit of a pacing issue, the first act felt a bit slow and like it was taking its time building the world and then the later acts are so quick that it feels non stop.Overall
Overall, The Adam Project is a good film that would be a pretty fun watch for anybody. The combination of Ryan Reynolds and director Shawn Levy hits the spot and I cannot wait to see their work together on Deadpool 3.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Super slick CGI and lots of zesty fight scenes, but the entire time continuum plot was completely implausible. Lots of scenes of soul searching family values and the pros and cons of playing God during which the action took a back seat that required yet another heavy handed SFX spaceship chase or quantum core meltdown to remind us that we were supposedly watching a Syfy action flick. So, not a total gag me with a proton torpedo movie, but maybe just enough of a premise to make you wish time travel was real so you could reset the last one hour and forty-six minutes to rewatch (insert your favorite Syfy movie here) instead.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

Whereas the former was a mostly original, sometimes over the top yet really entertaining video game based sci-fi romp, this time is a fully original really entertaining yet largely forgettable sci-fi romp. The film opens like most sci-fi films - in space, Reynolds plays Adam a pilot who messes with time travel to fix something in the past. That bit isn't fully original - Terminator comes to mind or any other sci-fi that dabbles into time travel. He goes to the past to save his younger self played by Walker Scobell, who even throughout the film sounds like Reynolds, and even though the film is largely original as it deals with different elements of time, it's also largely forgettable. But Reynolds and his smaller much younger twin's quips help keep the film alive through it's 106 minute runtime. Albeit the film does suffer, with it's thin script, a forgettable villain and the innocuous and yet contagious Reynolds, can even be too much for the film to handle, a sort of too much Reynolds to handle. The action set-pieces are entertaining too, in fact that is where the film shines, the sparkly, through the wibble wobble time-wimey stuff Reynolds shines it's clear here that the cast and crew had a lot of fun making as the villain's crew are launched like lemmings through Star Wars like set-pieces.Admittedly you'll watch this, you'll probably enjoy it and why wouldn't you? There's a lot to enjoy, The Adam Project is funny, fast-paced and quick on it's quips and whims, though it's a largely forgettable film and it suffers from too much Reynolds, it's a slickly entertaining - and occasionally moving sci-fi action romp. It's the kind of film where you shouldn't expect too much, much like Free Guy before it. With this you will enjoy it, but probably forget it after the credits roll. 3/5.","10 out of 39 found this helpful.

"6","/10","Ryan Reynolds is his usually charming self, but the movie feels like a remix from other time travel movies.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7947316/?ref_=tt_urv","IonicBreezeMachine","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur117926588/?ref_=tt_urv","13 March 2022","Adam Reed (Walker Scobell) is a 12 year old boy who due to his short stature, asthma, and mouthy attitude is often a target for bullying. The death of Adam's father Louis (Mark Ruffalo) has left a rift between him and his mother Ellie (Jennifer Garner). When Adam is left home alone he investigates a strange noise in the nearby woods and discovers a man (Ryan Reynolds) who turns out to be him from the year 2050. In the future Adam has stolen a time traveling jet intent on investigating the disappearance of his wife, Laura (Zoe Saldana), while eluding Maya Sorian (Catherine Keener) who has used Louis Reed's research to control Time Travel and amasse untold powers in the future. Now the two Adams must find a way to stop this future from coming to fruition.The Adam Project is the latest high concept star vehicle from Netflix, runiting the streaming service with director Shawn Levy (Stranger Things) and Ryan Reynolds (Red Notice, 6 Underground). The concept behind The Adam Project can be traced back to a spec script originally called Our Name is Adam from 2012 written by T. S. Nowlin, best known for his collaboration with Wes Ball on the Maze Runner trilogy. Although announced at Paramount as a vehicle for Tom Cruise in 2012, the film has lingered in development hell for over a decade and has now found itself in the hands of Shawn Levy and his production company 21 Laps. There's some charm to the film with committed performances, but there's also the air of ""I feel like I've seen this before"" and the movie reminds you of it quite a bit.I will say that the casting of Walker Scobell and Ryan Reynolds as the younger and older Adam Reed's respectively is well done and the two show some solid chemistry. This is Scobell's first major leading role and he'll next be seen in the Paramount sci-fi blockbuster Secret Headquarters later this year. Easily the best moments of The Adam Project are in seeing the two Adams play off each other and wile Scobell's delivery is a little lacking in polish, it's a solid effort for a first time lead.The rest of the movie feels pretty standard with the film being a mixture of The Last Starfighter, Back to the Future, Flight of the Navigator, and even the central premise of a ""younger self meets older self"" has been done in projects like Looper, Disney's The Kid, and even in the Jumanji spiritual sequel Zathura. The movie never really gives us a reason to care about avoiding this ""terrible future"" because we don't really know how bad it is and it's kept very vague how bad 2050 is with the only major sequence set in the time being a dogfight in the Earth's atmosphere in the film's opening sequence where older Adam steals the Time Jet. Catherine Keener's Maya Sorian feels like a placeholder villain and there's nothing all that interesting about her nor do we really know what exactly she's done. The movie also feels overly ""clean"" with its time travel aspect and rather than play with the paradoxes of time travel the movie feels like it's trying to avoid them so it can get to the next fight or chase sequence. The effects look okay and are par for the course of these 21 Laps productions that try to evoke 80s pop culture and iconography, but there's really nothing that popped out at me and distinguished it.The Adam Project is an okay time killer that you won't be bored watching, but it's not going to leave much impact on you and you'll probably forget most of it when you wake up the next morning. Ryan Reynolds is fine as is Walker Scobell in his debut role and the two have good chemistry together, but everything else felt very muted and called attention to the fact other movies like this exist rather than leaving its own footprint.","7 out of 25 found this helpful.

The character-driven relationship between adult Adam (Ryan Reynolds) and his younger self (thirteen-year-old Walker Scobell) is cinematic gold. The script provides a complex multi-tiered relationship with a lot of conflict, self-doubt, and guilt for the actors to explore. Both are talented and there is a lot of positive chemistry between them, as well as tension and conflict.The sci-fi/adventure plot is a hopelessly muddle of implausible contrivances to dismiss familiar temporal paradoxes. Catherine Keener plays a Pelosi-esque villainess who used insider information to become rich and powerful, then sold her soul to preserve her position. She hops through time with a phalanx of humanoid robots that fight like martial-arts masters and disintegrate when dispatched, allowing for large-scale fight scenes and Clockwork Orange ultraviolence without soaking the ground with blood or littering it with severed limbs.Fortunately, the movie largely avoids much of the woke content that makes so many recent films nearly unwatchable. None of the characters carries or uses a handgun and no police are anywhere in sight to trigger any radical leftist snowflakes in the audience, even when two bullies beat up a weak asthmatic schoolmate in broad daylight at a shopping center. To promote ethnic diversity, intercultural romances have become de rigueur. Adam's romantic interest is played by Hispanic Zoe Saldaña. The young Zoe, who played Cataleya in Colombiana, would have been a brilliant choice, if time travel were possible. She's still a strikingly beautiful woman, but eleven years and three babies later, she looks more like a soccer mom than a college freshman.Despite the contrived plot, the story is engaging, leaving the audience to wonder how the characters will extract themselves from this quagmire without creating some temporal paradox. Instead, all the characters seem to teleport themselves into some other movie playing at the cinema next door which kind of looks like the first movie, but takes place in a different cosmos of reality or some parallel universe.The ending isn't satisfying, but getting there is still fun.","2 out of 6 found this helpful.

Full of cliches... He has to have asthma, right? He has to! Every bullied kid has to have asthma. That must be an unwritten Hollywood law or something... Is it really that hard to come up with new ideas?I think the problem with this movie is that it wants to be everything at the same time. Science fiction, action, family drama, romcom... Unfortunately it fails miserably.The only thing that was good about this movie is the child actor who plays the young Adam. Everything else is just mediocre. Zoe Saldana playing a -not green- Gamora. Ryan Reynolds is as always himself and Mark Ruffalo has very little screen time just like Garner. SFX are OK for a Tv/Streaming movie...
This felt like a Kids Movie, like one of those you see on Nickelodeon or Disney Kids Channel... If you are between 5 and 12 years old you could enjoy it very much.

And the director has already got the taste of Mr. Deadpool. With The Adam Project, Levy brings up the most emotional side of Reynolds.Screenplay: As the film takes a fast pace, it leaves an empty mark for some of the potent characters, including Zoe Saldaña. Over screenplay keeps the good hold on the audience, but fails to give enough time for the characters to evolve in a speculated time frame.Cinematography: The cinematographer Tobias Schliessler takes a wonderful wide angles, especially the Jet fighter sequence and lake side scenes, but failed to tap the close ups during emotional scenes. I was really expecting a close up shot (panning the camera across) at the end, where most of the characters shed tears out of their respective loss.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Free Gy was complete trash and this title proves that Netflix only gets movies that studios passed on for major release.The premise of this film gets an A+, but the overall story, execution and passing all fail.Katie Keener is a horrible villain and should count her role in Get Out as a one off evel person. Ryan Reynolds is pretty funny, but he can't carry the film and the writing is actually downright awful. Walker turns in an impressive performance, but he can't carry the film either.Zoe is disposable and brought nothing to her role and I never believed her and Ryan were in a relationship and surprising, Ruffalo may have turned in the films strongest performance which should tell you what the caliber of this film really was.Shawn Levy is starting to remind me of. Simon Kinberg, someone that was once associated with quality titles until everyone realized it was a fluke and he was actually ruining franchises.This movie could have been so much more, should have been so much more, but in the end it came off like a VOD title with low budget VFX.The trailer was so good and the title doesn't come anywhere close to delivering on that promise.

You could do a lot worse than this film for a time-suck, especially considering Netflix's run of mediocre films recently......that being said my rating of 8 might be a slightly inflated 7, since I'm a sucker for any Sci-Fi Comedy, i.e. Galaxy Quest, Hitchhiker's Guide, Mars Attacks, the list goes on...","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

This movie was created to make money not as art or to make a statement. Nonetheless, it is a pleasant way to spend 105 odd minutes.Special effects are not blockbuster movie quality, but they are up to the job here. The script is fairly predictable but with enough interesting ideas percolating through to keep your intention. In fact, I felt some of these could have been developed more - e.g. Young Adam's relationship with the school bullies - but I guess that would have made for quite a long movie. The cast is mostly good. It's always a pleasure to see Mark Ruffalo in any movie. Zoe Saldana is here too because I think her contract says she has to be in every sci-fi movie that requires a female love interest. Jennifer Garner, who seems to be one of those ladies Hollywood calls on whenever they need someone to play a relatable mother character, is good as the mother. Ryan Reynolds plays, essentially, the same wise-cracking smart ass he plays in almost all of his movies. Catherine Keener is a fairly bland villain with Alex Millari Jr as her oriental (of course) henchman. The stand out in the cast is Walker Scobell as the young Adam. He acts well and steals the movie and I look forward to seeing him in future movies.I don't want to seem like I'm being too hard on this movie. It may not be anything remarkable, but I enjoyed it and so did the kids. If you're looking for something for your family movie night, you won't go wrong with this.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

Unfortunately this turned out to be a substandard, unwatchable dud. This film was centered around a man, Adam, who travels back in time and crash lands in the year 2022, he then teams up with his 12 year old self in a mission to save the future. While the plot of this film is in theory, an interesting idea, the dialogue fell flat. The movie's 'strong point' is built around the 12 year old version of Adam, who the entire movie is just doing a weak Ryan Reynolds impression. Reynolds then went on to bring in all his favorite cronies who turned in half-assed performances. In closing, I couldn't finish this film. Save yourself the time, and don't bother.","4 out of 7 found this helpful.

Those ingredients bring us to a well defined, well baked film which I think the majority of people are going to really like, despite Reynolds being the star.There's hidden nods to many sci fi greats that have come before, see how many you can get!","2 out of 8 found this helpful.

But, Reynolds has that something special when it comes to charisma and likeability. Plus he has that endearing smart-aleck thing that is rare indeed. Burt Reynolds practically invented it by the way. So, to me what makes this film watchable is Reynolds. I think I didn't particularly care for the actual story here yet concede it will be Sci-Fi that many younger folks will. In the end it's a good romp that is just family friendly enough to make a cut for that and it's just Ryan Reynolds enough for us older viewers. It wants to be warmer and fuzzier than it can actually achieve however. Pretty good CGI for a Netflix release I'd say so no problems there. The cast is excellent too. It might be 6.5 if I'm being generous. Personally I would like a more interesting story but it's entirely serviceable I guess.","2 out of 9 found this helpful.

This mysterious pilot turns out to be the time-travelling older version of himself from 2050. He has risked everything to come back in time on a secret mission. Together they must embark on an adventure into the past to find their father, set things right, and save the world.This, mostly original, film co-written and directed by the same person who directed Ryan Reynold's 2021 big hit (Free guy), Shawn Levy, is very fun and entertaining, especially that it's short and not slow-paced. The movie also had its pretty emotional parts scattered throughout. However, the ending was pretty expected to me yet not necessarily in the same way I thought it would end.Walker Scobel (who played younger Adam) did a really good job portraying a younger Ryan Reynolds, which shows that the casting team was great. His chemistry with Reynolds (who playes older Adam) is perfect as the interactions between the two are really good and quite funny. However, Reynolds, as always, performs really well but with a very similar character to all his other movies. Mark Rufallo's character (who plays Adam's father Louis Reed) reminds me of Bruce Wayne if he never was the Hulk. I would've liked to see a bit more of Zoe Saldana (who plays Laura, Adam's wife) and Jennifer Garner (who plays Adam's mother).The villain's story wasn't built-up perfectly as Maya Sorian (played by Catherine Keener) is a very basic and two dimensional character that you know nothing about and is just there so there would be a villian in the story.The script was pretty thin as the film is kind of forgettable and suffering from too much Ryan Reynolds, yet it is very funny.The fight and action scenes, although not found as much as I anticipated, where really good and very fun to watch. CGI was also great especially with the scenes with the futuristic soldiers and how they died. However, I would have really liked to see some more special effects as this is a sci-fi movie. Additionally, it contained some really beautiful natural scenes.The Adam Project is short Sci-Fi comedy, that of course has it's flaws, but if regarded as a movie made for young teens who wouldn't necessarily find those flaws, the movie would be considered a good one.Score: 7.5/10.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

In that case, they should have removed the implied sex scene or toned it down a bit.Nothing out of the ordinary happens, nearly 100% predictable from the outset and everything happens too easy. The previews make it look better than it is.","11 out of 27 found this helpful.

So far this film has 65 reviews not counting mine.So less then 100 reviews, and a bunch of people did not like ot for the story, production quality, writing, director or whatever.....
If you pay attention to the movie outside of the things people decide to dislike;
This film does a wonderful job of writing an underlying purposeful proposal which is:
Time Travel is developed realistically, For Realistic Ideas, Realistic Purposes. Outside of strictly discovering wormholes to transport people/things. Outside of watching a ""time travel film from 30 years ago"" which kept trying to say Time Travel will automatically be used for unrealistic endeavors by the human beings.Ultimately Humans Rip Each Other Apart Once The Reality of Time Travel is within grasp: Which Is Also An Open Nod To How People Do Work In This Life!I guess perspective is everything. So if all you want as a consumer/audience of this movie,
is to demand a perfectly written, directed, acted, worded story for only entertainment value (which there is no such thing in any form of story telling anyway) : Go Right Ahead and only see the small window.The bigger framed picture: for those who took the film and face value then noticed it too; this story is looking at time travel as a realistic way for people to come together and rebuild together.In theory one day we all may just have the selflessness to actively value the nuances in story telling.","9 out of 15 found this helpful.

This film is full of action sequences, comedy, drama, and most of all, full of heart. It's the kind of film that doesn't come around often and it's also a type of film that everyone needs every now and again. Ryan Reynolds is fantastic as always as the lead character Adam Reed who travels back in time to stop time travel from ever being invented. Along the way he encounters his younger self played by Walker Scobell who actually captures all of Ryan Reynolds character mannerisms like clockwork and is one of my favorite characters of the movie. Zoe Saldana plays Lauren Shade who is Adam Reed's wife and although she may have not had as much screen time as I hoped for, the chemistry between her and Ryan Reynolds was captured perfectly and made me want more of the two. Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner are also fantastic as the parents of Adam, as Louis and Ellie Reed. I wished we had gotten a little more screen time with these two characters together as well. Catherine Keener as the villain Maya Sorian I thought was a great choice, because it has been awhile since we've seen her in anything and after watching her performance as a villain in Get Out, playing a villain never gets old with her playing the character. Overall, The Adam Project is visually stunning, exciting, entertaining, funny at times and most of all full of heart that is enjoyable for all audiences alike. Rating 9/10.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

As all time travel movies, do not think too much about the repercussion that can occur. It is not broken, but still. Ryan Reynold plays Ryan Renolds, aka, the cool funny dude who can turn any situation, no matter how desperates into a sassy joke. The movie rely a bit much around the charisma of the character and it shows. Put any other actor in the role and the movie is just a crappy scify non sense. The sole purpose of the kid, aside for a few cutes moments, is for the exposition. He doesnt know anything and ask a lot of question, so the audience can follow up the plot. Over used trope very much appreciated in this convoluted plot. As I said, not original, but entertaining enough to keep watching.

"7","/10","An easily digestible fun wholesome time.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8048949/?ref_=tt_urv","Spartan_1_1_7","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur8202613/?ref_=tt_urv","10 April 2022","The Adam Project (2022) is another outing from the director-actor duo Shawn Levy and Ryan Reynolds, who gave us Free Guy last year, a movie I loved. With the premise being that in the future time travel exists and a fighter pilot goes back in time to team up with his younger self to save the future, I had to give this a try. While not on the same level of enjoyment as Free Guy, this one turned out to be another success for the duo. Interestingly, while looking at the director's filmography before putting down my thoughts about this movie, I had no idea I have watched several of the films he directed and pretty much all of them were enjoyable to some extent with my favourites being Real Steel (2015) and Night at the Museum (2006). The dude might not be making masterpieces but he sure has consistency for a good time from my experience.Anyway, the style and tone of the movie pay homage to the 80s sci-fi or fantasy family films or Spielbergian feel, without actually taking place in the 80s. I'm a fan of that era so I was hooked pretty much from the start. The action, the SciFi stuff, the production quality, it's all decent. CGI can be a bit wonky at times but it wasn't inconsistent to the point that it was annoying a lot of times save for one thing that I'll mention later on.The strongest point about the movie is what it had to nail in order for the experience to work i.e the relationship between Ryan Reynold's character Adam and his younger self, acted wonderfully by Walker Scobell. The kid rocked, I loved him and he genuinely felt like a young Ryan Reynolds and the banter between him and his older self was hilarious and endearing. I also enjoyed the aspect of connecting to your younger self as one grows old instead of forgetting it, the idea that one should keep the inner child so that one doesn't grow cold and heartless after being drenched in responsibilities as an adult, which just happens to be one of the core messages of one of my favourite books i.e The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupery.Ryan Reynolds himself was good in the role and he sold it well as a person who has unresolved issues from his past, particularly with his father. The movie, in general, surprised me with the performances. Even if certain actors didn't have a lot of screentime, they utilized that time effectively instead of phoning it in for an easy paycheck, whether it was Jennifer Garner or Zoe Saldana or Mark Ruffalo. Certainly a strong emphasis on the emotional side of things which I appreciated given the story of the movie.The weakest aspect that brought the movie down a notch or two was the villain and the final act. Catherine Keener wasn't bad in the role but she wasn't given a lot to work with. She also had a younger self who was poorly de-aged and that was distracting every time she was onscreen. The finale felt rushed and lazily written relative to the rest of the movie as if they wanted to get it over with and go to the ending and the wholesome message. Ironically, it would have made the catharsis better had there been more stakes and tension in the final struggle.Overall, despite its faults, I had a good time with this movie. It won't blow your mind, it is not groundbreaking, but it is an easily digestible fun wholesome time and if you're looking for something like that, give it a try. It's on Netflix too. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 7/10.","1 out of 6 found this helpful.

Noooo we are not allowed to say that.Hey everyone, it's time to travel back in time with Netflix's new sci-fi drama The Adam Project. A mood relaxing fun film starring Ryan Reynolds and child actor Walker Scobel in lead roles with Mark Ruffalo, Zoe Saldana, and Jennifer Garner in supporting roles.A consistently entertaining film that makes you laugh numerous times throughout its runtime. Director Shawn Levy gives us a well-balanced film by keeping the main focus on human relationships & emotions and, mixing it smartly with occasional adventures and actions sequences. Even though the basic plot of the film isn't innovative and the sci-fi elements are pretty much traditional but the way this film explains the time travel concept is genuinely interesting. The visual effects are fantastic.Ryan Reynolds and Walker Scobel who gives Reynolds a tough competition with his charismatic performance, are the key strength of this film. From start to end they keep us entertained with their laugh-a-minute kinda conversations.Want to enjoy a good fun movie on the weekend with friends and family? Fetch a bucket of popcorn, call some of your friends and enjoy this film.7.2/10Follow us on Instagram: m_movie_reviews.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It combined aspects from the terminator, back to the future and other movies. Yet half way through this movie I was very impressed thought it would be something different, but sadly by the end it just came together in a movie that wasn't very good.On the other hand Ryan Reynolds did a great job acting, he again plays the funny witty guys as usual but did surprised me when he had the ability to get emotional. Same with Zoe Saldaña, as I did know she was already a good actor when needed. She was able to convince me that she was hurt and emotional. Also the fight scenes in this movie were pretty solid and well choreographed.In conclusion, this movie like many others with a cool concept had a good begginging but in the end could have a good enough ending to finish the story. Ryan Reynolds surprised me with his acting in this movie and the fight scenes were well choreographed.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Alternate timestreams, super-villainous antagonists, and video-game-ish dogfights ensue - none of which ever feel relevant or spirited. They're just there to fulfill genre conventions without copying previous entries all too blatantly. Back to the Future this is not. But if you're willing to sit through the action cliches, The Adam Project rewards you with some fine interpersonal drama between the young and grown-up Adam, their mother (Jennifer Garner) and their deceased dad (Mark Ruffalo). Young Walker Scobell is a gem, he's like an adolescent version of Reynolds, and the quips and banter between them are just as funny as the affection they share is heartfelt.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and the younger boy was the best part of the movie. This movie plays a lot with time travel, which is a concept I'm somewhat tired of seeing in movies. Each movie with time travel rewrites the rules of how time travel works that's most convenient for the plot. It's gotten to a point where I just accept the ways time travel works for these movies instead of trying to understand it. Other than that, it has some decent action and laughs, fairly solid story, and some good acting and chemistry.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

Is the SciFi predicatable? Yes. But what was more touching for me was the scripting around grief and loss. The anger, the sadness, love, acceptance. This was a film about loss and acceptance. Lots of one liners (whether funny or poignant) that expressed something once learned in therapy. I was glad my kids watched it. They loved it for the jokes and action, but also, they absorbed some good lessons. I did too. You don't have to have it all together. You just need to be there. Kids need to know it's ok to be imperfect. And then Mark Ruffalo's conversation with his boys at the end. Wow. He nailed it. To have a parent say it like that. Great writing.

It has plenty of action like many other Ryan Reynolds movies.A few of the cast members you could recognize from various marvel projects, which includes: Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool in the Deadpool movies, Mark Buffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk in the MCU since the first Avengers movie (2012 Avengers, Age of Ultron, Thor Ragnarok, Avengers Infinity War, Avengers Endgame, and She-Hulk), Zoe Saldana as Gamora in the MCU (the Guardians of the Galaxy trilogy, and the last 2 Avengers movies, Infinity War and Endgame), and Jennifer Gardner in Ben Affleck's Daredevil franchise.It is similar to Back to the Future but different in many ways. It does have the premise to go back in time and what happens to you in the past affects the present. The big difference is how time travel works. Another difference is the whole ""don't interact with your past self"" don't really exist in this movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

There are way more good bits then there are bad ones, and towards the end there were quite a few REALLY good bits that made me completely sold on the experience as a whole.This is a time travel movie, a pretty decent one at that, because of the base premise it presents. They could've done a way better job with this though as they are a little too caught up in unorthodox ways to display the future tech (atleast imo). Also the Star Wars fan servicing is to a point which I found it was starting to get seriously annoying. Since the weapons copied over wouldn't be weapons of choice if this were actually a true to life story.The movie tries its best to be an emotional home run but gets to this way to early at the start. A character we are just introduced to goes through something very dramatic, and they play it up like we are supposed to be sad about this although we know nothing about the person in question.Other oddball scenechoices makes the minds behind this movie look rather scatterbrained, atleast to me. However I guess in a way it adds to the ""charm"" if you could even call it that. I think the movie would've done better without any of this charm though. Or atleast it could've done without the bigger part of it.All in all this is a weak 8 for me. Was considering leaving a seven and calling it a strong seven, however I feel as if though this deserves a boost in rating from it's current one, and I have no issues in putting this into the weak 8 category.Watched and enjoyed.","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

In that regards he will remind some of Johnny Depp (from an acting kind of view).This flick has him double down and go all in with the Ryan quirky jokes and puns. The film is mainly targeted at a 9-15 age imo but there is some slight profanity slurs thrown in there. The villains are not as well flashed out and their performance fall a bit flat.

It fails as a serious sci-fi and the comedy is cheesy, with the compulsory handbrake turn to prescribed emotion thrown in at the prescribed, paint-by-numbers, point in the movie, exactly where it should be, why? Well, because that's the way they always do it to churn out formulaic tropes.I won't bother getting into the contradictions in the physics because other reviews address that, albeit they dismiss the concept of a multiverse in the movie by suggesting it's not another well known film with multiverses in it. Quite a cynical way to slip out of any credible supposition that changing the past alters the future along a different timeline. It came across as the writers saying they couldn't be bothered to get into the science and they're telling you that, as if that excuses them.Ryan Reynolds is typecast at this stage and sadly it could have been any of his nonchalant vanilla roles, with similar quips, except this film just wasn't very funny, and suffered from the one thing it's generally a golden rule to avoid in time travel movies ... predictability.Waiting for something good on Netflix these days is starting to become a challenge.","9 out of 23 found this helpful.

Ask me within 6 months and I won't know. There's probably an unspoken rule in Hollywood - If we cast Reynold, let him be himself and we'll just let the film roll. Yes, Ryan can carry an entire movie but when does this end? Believe me, I like Ryan Reynolds, his quip, the sarcasm, the charisma, yes, the entire package. But that cannot be the entire movie. Give me a story, a range of emotions, and make me connect to you. It's not that hard.Overall, the movie is like any other time-travel movie. It's got good acting, an average script, a very beautiful Jennifer Garner and the usual science side of Mark Ruffalo. Young Adam plays his role well. It's a good watch if you want something light and don't want to use your head. You can watch this movie even while you do other things and you won't have lost the plot. It's a good movie for all ages, Ryan doesn't get his Deadpool side.

I'm not a big movie watcher, when I do though, I don't really watch action, comics, or sci-fi. I do, however, like Ryan Reynolds. Still probably haven't seen most of his movies, but after seeing Deadpool I realized he could essentially melt away the genres for me, and poke fun at the things about them that usually annoy me. Having said all that, his ""schtick"" might be old to some but it doesn't rub me that way.Onto the movie. I found all of the main characters endearing (except villain Catherine Keener, who as an actress I love), and with a desire to see them through safely. Even through the CGI (not normally a fan), I found it enjoyable, even convincing enough to swerve in my seat a couple times when ships appeared from nowhere in the skies. This movie has heart, laughs, action, and the actors all do a great job in reeling you in to make you want to care. It left me with a smile.Special shout-out to Walker Scobell for debuting his 12 year old acting chops alongside some big league actors, job well done, young sir. I suspect we'll be seeing him around for a while!","2 out of 2 found this helpful.

Its sci-fi premise of a time traveler teaming up with his younger self is fun, but that positive is overshadowed by formulaic MacGuffins, empty drama, and forced quippy dialogue. Likewise, Ryan Reynolds shows vulnerabilities, yet mostly plays his typical sarcastic self. That snarky humor can work in the right situations, but becomes grating when overused. Furthermore, Garner, Saldana, and Ruffalo all provide some emotion, but their smaller roles come with strained comedy as well. Overall, The Adam Project has some heart and creativity, but not nearly enough for audiences to actually care.Meanwhile, The Adam Project's filmmaking is generic. The cinematography has moments of lighting, focus, and framing, but is mostly unimaginative. Similarly, the editing is never interesting and the sound is rarely elevated. The music uses recognizable songs, but they aren't related to the material on screen. Plus, the production design is painfully unoriginal and the excessive CGI is cheap (making the film look like a Syfy original). Clearly, the priority of The Adam Project was its famous cast, since that's the only reason the film is relevant. Ultimately, it might have glimmers of potential, but The Adam Project does nothing worth watching.Writing: 3/10

You could have an hours fun afterwards picking out all the plot holes but why bother. The film never dragged at any stage and we both clapped at the end - not something I would normally do, I hasten to add :)I'll be honest.

However it suits this movie at least so well done there. The Kid who plays the younger version of Ryan's character was probably the most likable and did an incredible job. Definitely enjoyed seeing him in the movie. Zoe Saldana, Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo all did good jobs with the albeit scarce screen time and few spoken lines that they had. All in all the casting was great, and the performances all were good enough with the only note worthy one being the kid.The storyline itself is kind of simple and straightforward. It won't leave you with questions or asking yourself about time loops or if the chicken or egg came first, unlike other time travel movies that will have you wracking your heads for years. However it worked fine for the film as this was more geared towards kids and a younger audience who wouldn't want to spend hours on end trying to make sense of a convoluted storyline.Special effects and all were pretty great so no comment there.All in all The Adam Project is a enjoyable film to watch, it's got action, a good cast, nice special effects and will keep you entertained, though you won't leave the cinema analyzing every event or minute of film.Good job and 7/10 from me. Don't think there will be a sequel but would be interesting to see!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Those scenes had me squint my eyes not to let it ruin the movie for me. I have a feeling YouTube will be filled to the brim with people discussing the horrible cgi done on that. Why didn't they use current Keener for the young version and just grimed her to look older. She's a good looking woman.So my advice is basically: squint your eyes every time cgi Keener appears on screen or watch it in horror.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

They bring in big actors, and they obvisously have a proper budget, but still they come short in outdoor setting scenes and the script.It is not only in this movie, but in other Netflix's movies and some series as well. I can dig the fact that digital effects allow for indoor setting for almost everything, but it cannot simply substitute the outdoor scenes in movies.In my opinion, this is getting frustrating and will eventually decreace Netflix's value in movie production (and series), especially on the Sci-Fi genre.Finally, scripts. I mean there are some talanted script writers working their ass off and I am sure the do work with Netflix, but I get the feeling they are not allowed to expand the boundaries of sci-fi storytelling, since they may lose their target audience?Come on Netflix! After SO many time-travel AMAZING movies, the scripts need to be more thought-provoking!!

I'm so tired of reading reviews about sci-fii, superhero movies, horror movies or any kind of movie that takes an imagination. These movies have a place, to allow us to sit down and be entertained. I don't need to understand time travel, or be an expert in physics to enjoy this movie. Actually if you were you probably won't enjoy this movie. This movie is awesome. It's exactly the kind of summer blockbuster I remember going to the movies as a 12-year-old kid to watch. In fact, I wish I saw this in the theater on the big screen with my son. Full of action, laughs and full of heart. Watch it with your family!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The SF part of it is pretty weak - either things that have been done before or such bad science that you'll shake your head (why has Hollywood decided on one theory of time travel, and a BAD one at that?). But the movie is well-paced, well-acted, and entertaining - just don't expect too much more than a movie worth having a bowl of popcorn with - Frankly, I will settle for that every time considering what has been coming out of Hollywood lately. OH, and it is definitely a Ryan Reynolds vehicle - he carries the movie.

Something about him as an actor I've never been able to stomach but -- he's normally not as funny or cool as he thinks he is -- but in this movie he makes it work because he's up against his 12 year old self. It's a simple premise, a screw-up with time travel sends people in all sorts of directions and times trying to fix it. The chase /actions scenes were saved from monotony due to the humor (chase scenes are so cliche). The movie never loses sight of the childhood family issue future Adam has carried with him for decades, and it's lovingly resolved in the end. It's a great kids movie but does have some bad language, though somehow framed in the humor it doesn't come across as vulgar (to me). It was worth the time to watch it but I wouldn't pay money to buy it. Jennifer Garner was perfect in her role as Mom. Lots of colorful, catchy special effects kids of all ages with love. Worth a watch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film tries to convey personal and emotional elements, but fails to do so with the convolution of questions that constantly create plot holes that could have easily ended the film quicker. It creates a disconnection to the story the film was trying to tell, ultimately making it feel longer than it needed to be. The leads of the film, while for the most part are entertaining, the youngest proves to be borderline unlikable due to how annoying he becomes. The villain also feels underdeveloped, portrayed by an actress that is much better than the material given to her. Despite the creative elements that can be respected for how much it tries, the film is bogged down by its obvious Steven Spielberg visual impersonations. Overall this film had promising intentions, but lack the creative minds behind the camera to tell a memorable story.","10 out of 28 found this helpful.

The movie's core themes center on the difficulties of family dynamics and the influence of time travel on personal development. Ryan Reynolds plays Adam, a pilot who meets his younger self and sets out on a time travel mission to save the future. Ryan Reynolds is known for his charm and wit in this role. Reynolds plays the lead role with effortless grace, displaying his comedic timing as well as his ability to emote sincere feelings, which endears and relatable the character.Shawn Levy, the director, should be commended for his skillful blending of several genres to produce an audience-pleasing movie. The pacing is brilliant, combining thrilling action scenes with poignant moments to keep the spectator interested. The story is skillfully interwoven with time-travel elements, providing both suspense and profound observations on the decisions we make in life. Reynolds's developing friendship with Walker Scobell, who plays his younger counterpart, is a major feature of the movie because of their chemistry, which gives the narrative an additional degree of reality.The Adam Project is notable not only for its captivating story and outstanding acting but also for its capacity to convey a deep message about the value of relationships, family, and the decisions that determine our futures. It's a heartwarming journey that gives viewers a fresh perspective on the importance of love and second chances as well as a wave of nostalgia.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I will either be heavily invested in the plot and nothing can stray my focus or I will fall asleep to some background noise. Quite a few of Reynold's movies seem to straddle the line however. Despite excellent dialogue and action scenes, they seem to be more about the aforementioned Reynolds showing off than anything.The plot is fairly straightforward, using time travel to stop the invention of time travel. However as with most plots like this, they describe how it is achieved. This will most likely bore those who don't quite understand the science they refer too, and upset those who do understand. Back to the future anyone?The dialogue is fantastic of course, the natural witty charm of Ryan Reynolds and the talents his co stars Garner and Ruffalo. Whoever decided to cast the young Walker Scobel deserves praise. That was about the most convincing aspect of time travel in the whole flick. Action scenes are well choreographed and highly enjoyable to watch.I'd like to point out a certain trend happening with movies as of late. Many actors are producing and directing films. And despite their obvious talents, they tend to gravitate towards self-promotion. What I mean is, a great movie isn't necessarily having every scene an incredible action sequence, and I don't want to see funny but tired jokes and lines in every scene. Great moments are only great if they are accompanied by ones less so.All in all not a hard film to get through, but I don't see it becoming a cult classic.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

I've always been a Reynolds fan since the mid 2000's. Then people seemed to have lost interest in him; until 'Deadpool' that is. Then no one could seem to get enough. He is actually a good actor and has done several diverse roles, but lately I think people just love him too much as the comedic sarcastic person he's known to be, so thats what we keep getting. Which is honestly okay with me.As a whole the movie has good effects (other than the driving through the woods), and is a fun, funny, family action film. Mark Ruffalo hits those key sentimental notes. The kid did a pretty good job acting as a 12 year old Reynolds too, so kudos to him.Seeing as this is from the people who also did 'Free Guy', I feel as though I have to say I enjoyed 'Free Guy' much more.","0 out of 4 found this helpful.

I mean, of course, time travel is in the center of the action, but the whole meaning of the movie is more important than that. Family ties, coming of age, reflecting on life are all issues you will come across in this film. And that's not half bad for me.But it's so absolutely full of clichés both action- and dialog-wise that for me it doesn't cut it. I knew every line that was going to be thrown and every plot outcome right from the start - I caught myself fast forwarding all the time.It was somewhat fun at certain points, and if you are into this kind of action sci-fi films you might enjoy it. But there's so much computer animation potential these days (making FX more or less irrelevant), that script should paid more attention to.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Then it surprises you again and again. A mostly solid movie with just a few weird things.So Im gonna start at the end. The end was stupid. The father does not want to change the future even though they changed the future back to the way it was....even though I thought the father was killed by the main protaganist..so Im not sure why he is still dead.. Its pretty weird to do all that just to have the father die. The other woman died now sso the future has already been changed.... AnywaysI thought Adam said he met the girl in flight school but with no war...and yet they still meed exactly the same way. Pretty hard to believe.And I do love the good Place but the actor plays a terrible bad guy here. It almost ruins the whole movie.And of course I like Ryan Reynolds...but He tries to do too many deadpool impersonation moments. We all think of these moments as the true Ryan Reynolds...but I hate it now. When he whispers in that high pitched voice trying to be funny,...its over the top. It does not work well in this movie I think. But his heart of gold moments are really well done. I mean damn when he met his mom in the bar..that emotion was genius.That is all i have to say about that.Oh except for wasnt it stupid how that woman died at the end. A magnet powerful enough to stop a bullet and yet the gun is still in her hand...adn they just walk out without any problems...What about the world melting down scenario?

It is what it is and what it is, is fun.That said, I will say that the writing is a little inconsistent when it comes to time travel tropes and that should have been caught during filming.Sometimes a change in the timeline has no effect (until you return to the future), sometimes it takes hours to show any changes and sometimes its practically instantaneous if the script needs it to be....changing the rules to suit the scene and payoff is quite noticeable and kinda takes you out of the zone to scratch your head; which is a shame really or I would have rated this film higher.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

It has that taste of a contemporary magic formula that invites you to go to the movies and fall in love with the humor, the action, the visual effects and a fantastic story based on a question that many of us have asked ourselves at some point: What would you do if you found yourself with the version young of yourself? Time travel is always attractive if it is well justified in any story.The strong points of the film are a dynamic script that has a rhythm that is constant and accelerated, but simple, understandable and entertaining; the visual effects (except for the rejuvenation of the antagonist) and Walker Scobell.The low points of the film, the costumes and Ryan Reynolds, who again repeats the same personality of his last films.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Don't expect huge twists, if you want that kind of enjoyment, watch the series Dark after this one.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It's not just all comedy though and there are some genuinely moving moments with the dad and mom played by Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner respectively. Likewise, Zoe Saldana gives a strong performance despite her very brief appearance in the movie. Another aspect I appreciate is that the movie doesn't use shaky cam or overly edits the action sequences which is just a blessing on the eyes.However, the CGI is quite bad and there are a lot of very noticeable green screen. For some reason they also don't use actual explosions but CG explosions which just looks lame. I am also a little annoyed that the 2050 soldiers who have these futuristic guns, yet the bullets still act like a normal modern day gun. Could've tried to be a bit more creative...Overall, if you want something entertaining to watch for about 100 minutes then this is definitely a good film to watch.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Just one of such an example: talking about getting laid with a kid at 12 years old? In a kid's adventure movie? What were they thinking?We know Ryan Reynolds from his freaky, gross comedies. (Deadpool). That movie is full of adult jokes and they do work brilliantly in Deadpool, which is an R-rated movie though. But that adult oriented style simply does not go down well in a kid's adventure movie. Did they talk about having sex in E. T? Could you imagine that? That would be so gross and destroying the magic of an adventure story.More bad: they made the kid's character too smart. His character is simply not true to life. And that's a bummer, because the kid is the 2nd leading actor.Even more bad: the timing of many of the jokes is off. Almost every joke is timed wrongly. Read out too fast, without a pause to let the joke land on it's feet.Not any good then? It's not terribly bad, not at all, but it is especially lacking in true to life characters, which is an important lack, because this movie tries to center around family life and family bonds. But how should I as a viewer take this family seriously, when all the characters are made out of cardboard and say things that are not age appropiate?","20 out of 70 found this helpful.

I believe that the main problems of the film are the script and editing, the first one helped by a very chaotic plot and narrative, you wonder what the characters' objective is for at least the initial 50 minutes, and a script that has many holes even, I wondered about everything that involved this time travel that went on for a year, but another character died that year, and the other came back to find her and then they will meet again, you don't understand, right, the script follows this same principle there, not to mention that some dialogues and situations in the movie that try to create humor only embarrass others. The other problem is that the editing of the film needed more polishing, there are too long scenes that do not add anything to the development of the plot and hinder the narrative, it is a film of 1h46min, but it seems to take a lot longer for the characters to finally start to pursue their goals is clear, luckily, the film's direction manages most of the time to get around these problems with the tone under control, it takes on the absurd nature of the film with touches of more intimate moments that didn't seem too out of place, in addition to him directing the action of the film with his hand on the primer, it doesn't get in the way, but it doesn't compromise either. The cast does well for the most part, Ryan Reynolds, with his comic way, manages to get around the awkward moments and even delivers cute scenes, but he's still the usual Ryan Reynolds, the boy Walker Scobell does well here he has personality, charisma, delivers a certain convincing vulnerability and he handles the scenes that are most demanded, Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner and Zoe Saldana don't have much to do here, but they are fine as usual and Catherine Keener makes such a caricatured villain generic and your motivations are so weak that my God in heaven. The visual effects of the film are at best working, there are scenes well produced and others where you notice a strange thing there or here that can cause a certain distraction, and the film has even touching moments about family and fatherhood, even if it is superficial. ""The Adam Project"" does not offer anything new in the genre, it has a very irregular script, but it is fun and even touching.Note: 6.2.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The main character, Adam, played by Ryan Reynolds, is a pilot from the future who travels through time and crashes in 2022. He enlists the help of his 12-year-old self to repair the future. Reynolds's usual performance style is well-suited to this movie. The child actor who plays young Adam is quite amusing, and their interactions are enjoyable. Zoey Saldana and Mark Ruffalo also deliver powerful performances despite their limited screen time. While the plot can be a bit confusing, it's still understandable. The movie's tone is consistently appropriate, and the humor is genuinely funny. Additionally, the action sequences are impressive. However, some of the computer-generated effects, particularly those used to de-age Catherine Kenner's character, are less than satisfactory. The film's antagonist, Kenner, is an unusual villain with poorly developed motivations, and her army is unremarkable. Nevertheless, this movie is a well-crafted and enjoyable Netflix production.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It improves when Mark Ruffalo arrives and comes to a heartwarming conclusion.It's nothing groundbreaking; it basically treads a familiar ground trod by most movies aimed at a young audience nowadays but I appreciate the fact it's not another sequel or remake.

SUCKERS!I watched this movie for what it was meant to be, an entertaining movie, no more, no less, it's really stupid and assanine to spend 1:46 Mins pulling a movie apart looking for social redeeming values or for some lesson that's not there, then trash the movie when it doesn't meet your expectations. How in hell can you take Ryan Reynolds seriously, he's comic who tried to act, some time he's pretty good and make (again) entertaining movies.I read a review by some nimrod moron who is trying to compare The Adam Project to a movie project Steven Spielberg may have produced, by calling this movie DULL! He or she evidently watched it while sleeping. This movie is a good movie, not a great movie, but it has great special effects and they blow a lot of stuff up. So stop the complaining because you can't enjoy a fun, entertaining movie, and see it for what it is. It's ENTERTAINING Morons.Oh, and who in there right mind is busy looking for PEE in a little boy's pants, what are you a pervert? So the wide shot, didn't show a pee stain, then to he was wearing dark pants. That's not a GOOF! You didn't really expect the boy to pee in his pants, or did you?

Some relatively glaring goofs in the face of the 'science' (/magnets) towards the end, but that doesn't take away from a plot dipping into more emotional family relationships.

I saw craft without the art and soul. A disappointing experience. Good films are rare. The establishment likes consumers, they consume and forget and consume again and forget again... to do their revolution. Such superficial movies without profound reason to be won't surely teach a viewer something new, something useful, something worth their precious time.

I can report back and say whereas the story is a bit too overfamiliar, it is interesting enough for it to keep you entertained from start to finish. It's nothing too special and it does have some plot holes that are never fully explained but you don't need that fine tuning for it to be a film you can throw on and have a good time. The movie does have essences of Steven Spielberg films like E. T. and Ready Player One with its tone and atmosphere and these were clear inspirations for the director Shawn Levy (Free Guy, Night at the Museum). These inspirations do elevate the movie but obviously doesn't have as much of an impact as a Spielberg movie.Acting 4/5:This movie has an all star cast including Ryan Reynolds (Deadpool, Free Guy), Mark Ruffalo (Thor: Ragnarok, Spotlight), Zoe Saldana (Guardians of the Galaxy, Avatar), Jennifer Garner (Elektra, Yes Day) and a stand out performance from Newcomer Walker Scobell who has a bright future ahead of him. Scobell was able to capture my attention straight away with the witty delivery of his lines and the range of emotions he is able to portray. Ryan Reynolds (even though he was being his usual kooky self) was entertaining as usual and even Jennifer Garner (who seems to be a little bit more popular now) is able to shine in many parts throughout. With these big named actors, you would expect a certain level of gravitas to their performance and each and every actor seems to be having the time of their life, but there is one exception. Unfortunately, the villain, Maya played by Catherine Keener (Being John Malkovich, Get Out) felt out of place in a few scenes and this is not only due to the acting or script but down to some visual scenes in later portions of the movie which pull you out.Visuals 3/5:With that Segway, it brings me to the visuals which unfortunately are very hit or miss in my opinion. There are scenes which show off how far visual effects have come such as some of the brilliantly shot and choreographed hand-to-hand fighting sequences but there are also scenes which feel like it is a very early 2000's film and unfortunately looks more like game graphics (it would be perfectly placed in something like a halo game). There are even moments where it gets too close to uncanny valley for me and that pulls you out of the movie at the wrong moments. There are also very recycled visual elements that we have seen done better in other films and there are certain aesthetics that look to familiar (there's that word again).Editing 3.5/5:The cohesiveness of the scenes and the fast paced nature of how the scenes were edited makes this movie feel like a theme park ride. With the movie having a great mixture of action, emotion and drama, the pace never felt like it pumped the breaks and this was a great way to tell this particular story. I was never bored and loved how some of the fight sequences were edited, to the point where you felt very involved and could see every single hit. As mentioned earlier, with some of the visuals being lacklustre it impacted the overall editing in how some scenes were put together (I can't imagine how hard it must have been to edit some of the visual effects heavy sequences).Sound 2.5/5:Unfortunately, the score by Rob Simonsen (Ghostbusters: Afterlife, The Spectacular Now) was very generic and unmemorable and wasn't as hard hitting as you needed the soundtrack to be in certain scenes. With this being the weakest part of the movie, it doesn't mean it was a train wreck. Some of the sound mixing for the weapons and the ships were great and the impacts and explosions in the action sequences were well realised.Summary:All in all this was a fairly decent movie with a recycled storyline but with some amazing talent, especially Walker Scobell but it didn't have enough scope and interesting enough plot lines to make this a memorable enough project.Overall score: 3.2/5.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

After all, their previous collaboration was 'Free Guy (2021)'. Yet, it's worth noting that the flick is genuinely better than I expected it to be. 'The Adam Project (2022)' is by no means great, and in fact borderlines on being just fine for its majority, but it's also by no means bad. It's no secret that Reynolds' particular brand of endless yapping is starting to wear thin for a lot of people, myself included. Here, though, he's slightly less annoying than usual because he's working from a screenplay that actually affords him something deeper to work with. His immature, cynical and insecure underpinnings give his motormouth an almost tragic touch, and the flick knows when to rein him in to allow its emotion to outperform its comedy. That emotion is actually where the affair is at its most successful, too. It mines its time travel premise for almost all it's worth, not only commenting on the differences between its lead character's wide-eyed yet still snarky younger self (played to almost mirror-image perfection by Walter Scobell) and his emotionally scarred older version but also putting quite a bit of focus on both of their relationships with their parents. There's a scene between Reynolds and Jennifer Garner which feels like it's ripped straight out of a far more mature tearjerker. The emotional elements grant credence to the sillier science-fiction and out-of-the-blue action, making sure that the film is at least watchable for its entire runtime. Despite some pacing issues, the picture can be a fair bit of fun when it gets going. It's only ever so successful, but it's enjoyable enough for what it is. I just have to warn you, though: it features what's easily the most unsettling example of digital de-ageing I've ever seen. I mean, it's truly horrifying. Other than that, though, this is a fairly fun family friendly farce with an unexpected amount of emotional weight.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

The Adam Project mercifully doesn't get bogged down in time travel mechanics, wasting little time to get the two Adams together on their journey.Reynolds is reliably embodying an onscreen persona audiences are familiar with, though he is given moments of emotional sincerity to help flesh the character out. In terms of sci-fi action, The Adam Project doesn't reinvent the wheel (though there are some neat visuals and concepts). What makes it click is the strength of the characters and their personal stories, getting viewers invested in what's happening onscreen.The Adam Project is a thoughtful, witty mash-up of all the movies from my childhood. Ryan Reynolds is on top form as Adam, while Walker Scobell matches him punch for punch with a great debut performance.My Rating : 8/10.","13 out of 27 found this helpful.

Following the fun romp that was RED NOTICE (with Gal Gadot and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), he is back in the Shawn Levy helmed THE ADAM PROJECT.And while this film is not doing anything special, nor will it be nominated for any kind of awards, it is a fun, entertaining way to spend a couple of hours.Family friendly, THE ADAM PROJECT, stars Reynolds as...you got it...Adam. A time traveling pilot who goes back in time to find his father - the inventor of time travel - and stop him. Along the way, her runs into his younger self, his mother and a very important person from Adam's past...or rather...future...or...You get the idea, it's a time travel movie, so I wouldn't get too caught up in ""the rules"" or dig too deeply into the plot.Reynolds, of course, is charming as pilot Adam, ready with a laser gun and a quip. His quick wit and snappy banter is reminiscent of many, many other roles that Reynolds has played...and that is okay. He is joined by his younger self (dubbed Small Adam) who is played as a young Ryan Reynolds mimic very well by newcomer Walker Scobell. To be honest, Scobell is annoying early on in this film - and that is on purpose - for what is charming in the adult Reynolds is really annoying in a 12 year old.Jennifer Garner (Mom), Mark Ruffalo (Dad) and Zoe Saldana (mysterious person from Adam's past...I mean...future) are ""professional"" in their respective roles, bringing the right amount of whatever their character needs at the moment. Finally, surprisingly, indie film icon Catherine Keener is very good as the ""bad buy"" in this piece.All of this is handled deftly by Shawn Levy (NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM). His track record shows that he knows how to do these family friendly, action/comedy/adventure films and he does not disappoint here. He moves things along at a brisk enough pace to keep all interested while throwing in comedy and snappy banter along the way.All-in-All, a very fun way to spend a couple of hours - certainly a good way to spend a crisp Spring evening whilst waiting for the warmer weather to arrive.Letter Grade: B+7 1/2 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

Jennifer Garner has her hands full w/her precocious, motor-mouthed son, Walker Scobell, as he's gotten into trouble in school (definitely a repeat offender). We find out his dad has died some time before & Garner hasn't really broached the subject of closure over her husband's passing which explains the continued tension in their relationship. Later the same night Reynolds shows up skulking around the forest surrounding Scobell's home being pursued by some toughs led by Catherine Keener in futuristic aircraft. We find out Reynolds is in fact Scobell's future self hoping to go further back into the past to prevent his father, Mark Ruffalo, from creating the time traveling tech which we'll learn will be used towards nefarious ends. Hoping to right the wrongs he perpetrated due to his father's absence, Reynolds mission is usurped by his younger self & by extension his mouth (the typical Reynolds' schtick) which completely dilutes the heartwarming homilies director Shawn Levy (A Night at the Museum/Real Steel) is hoping to put across. You know your film's heading in the wrong direction when you hope your lead will just shut up for a second. Also starring Zoe Saldana (frankly wasted!) as Reynolds' future girlfriend.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The cast do solid work. Ryan Reynolds plays a character in which he has done many times, although he is a little more toned down here.What was slightly unrealistic is his character is from the year 2050 and technology and the overall landscape looks far more futuristic. Do they believe that in 28 years years that is how they think the future would resemble (film takes place in 2022). The attire of the assassins look nice but not much detail was on how once they got attached, they would dissolve into bright colors and fade away. Are we to believe these weren't humans? They could have explain a little more of the origins.The ending was slightly disappointing and anti climatic which lowers the rating as a whole. Otherwise solid film for the time being and it seemed to be a success for Netflix but it feels like maybe this film may be sort of forgotten. Although it is a film which will make people question about their past and future and possibly have a certain nostalgia affect.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The net just has too big of holes in it, so a lot of the audience falls through it instead of being ensnared. Is this a children's movie? The look of the CGI seems to suggest it along with the main character being a child, but the continuous cursing seems to suggest it's an adult movie. It's obviously SciFi centered around time travel, but then it makes a push for drama but having very silly, cheesy moments that could undermine it. At times it does each of these different things well, but it also felt a bit unfinished. Parts of the CGI were great and others looked more like Shark Boy and Lava Girl. The fight scenes were cool, but several parts you can tell it's coreographed and doesn't feel real. It just didn't quite all come together. But if you want a fun evening with some action, drama, and storytelling, then this will fill that purpose well. It just won't leave you amazed.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And if you are in the latter category, this isn't going to be the film to win you over to Reynold's comedy ways. For that, I would recommend Steven Levy's and Reynolds other partnership ""Free Guy"". But if you are a fan of Reynolds and his quippy, 4th wall breaking comedy, then you should like this film just fine.The film has decent effects and good performances from each of its stars and has some good moments of heart filled life lessons. The film feels like it is genuinely trying.On the negative side, it feels like every person is written to be the same quippy smart Alec as Reynolds. It makes sense for young Adam to act the same. But when Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner and Zoe Saldana are all making the same types of jokes, they kind of lose their impact, and characters lose their identity.Newcomer Walker Scobell does a good job in the role, but his character just ended up getting on my nerves most of the time. The movie also has two stock bully characters that are just inserted in the movie for the sake of being stock bully characters. But, throughout the story, I did find myself laughing a handful of times. The action, although completely bloodless and child friendly, didn't leave me disoriented or confused.The movie has a finale that doesn't make much sense when you think about it for more than 4 seconds. And ends off with me wondering if any of the characters have improved from the beginning of the story, and whether any audience member has improved from watching this movie.","3 out of 7 found this helpful.

The plot is basic and it's an enjoyable movie but if you want movies that are for the whole family, choose comedy. Jim Carrey, Will Ferrell and more are better in every point than this lazy action movie. Ryan Reynolds and mark ruffalo are good though. The plot is really boring. But the budget is great, and I think that it's cool for kids to see a movie with a fun idea, it's like a kid made an idea and Hollywood took it and put millions in it, to be more precise, it's a 6,4 out of ten, but it's still a good movie.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I really enjoyed this movie and hope that movies moving forward will be more like this one.","3 out of 4 found this helpful.

Young males rated most highly, and older females; whereas older males and younger females voted much lower score...As an older male, I wasn't sure who this is really directed at. With the kid being the main character, and that people just burst into a glow of light when killed, it suggests a solid kids flick. But then the plot becomes a convulted time travel plot that isn't particularly fulfilling.I enjoyed the cheesy but well produced action scenes, but the plot, whilst moving forward well, is pretty weak and not adequate for an adult audience. It really feels like a wasted cast, and could have been a great film with more emotional content and more sophisticated script. I expected it to be better, but really, if you're bored on a Sunday and are watching with a young male child, it will fill the time with fun and frolicks, but definitely forgettable.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This film is so fun and really heartwarming. I found it consistently entertaining and had a great time watching it despite its flaws.The cinematography of this film is pretty good! The camerawork used felt very professional and there's a lot of nice framing choices. I also really like the set design! In terms of visual effects, this film uses a lot of CGI. It's often used well and looks good, but nearer the end the filmmakers de-age certain actors with CGI and this unfortunately looks quite goofy.The sound design in the film is good, but nothing outstanding. The mixing is done well and clearly and the score is fitting to the tone. However, the score does get rather repetitive and unfortunately feels very forgettable.The actors all do a great job, but the standout is definitely Ryan Reynolds. I'm not always the biggest fan of his humour, but this movie had me laughing out loud often due to Reynolds' flawless line delivery. His character is so loveable and a fun protagonist to follow along. However, the villain isn't a strong enough character and isn't a believable threat, the character needed a lot more development.Lastly, the movie has a fun concept and follows a fairly basic structure, but this results in an easygoing and entertaining watch. The pacing is steady and consistent, and includes a lot of heartfelt and emotional moments.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The movie takes both older adam and younger through this story of making amends with relationships in their lives. It's a really heartwarming emotional character story that's great to see.Ryan Reynolds plays the same character he has been for the last decade except this time his name is Adam Reed. Don't get me wrong I think Reynolds is a talented actor but his range of characters is very narrow.Walker Scobell plays the young adam and he does a really good job of making you buy into the fact that he is a younger Ryan Reynolds.Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner, Zoe Saldana all did great with what they were given.The core issue I have with this film is the lack of development for most of the characters. This is a short movie which is nice and refreshing but it seems as though they set out to make a bigger movie than what they actually made.There was a couple of spots where the CGI needed to be cleaned up especially involving some deageing they did.I throughly enjoyed the action and was impressed with the choreography throughout. The plot was well paced and made sense throughout which is unusual for time travel films. The comedy was also great at definitely had me laughing out loud a few times.Overall this is a fun sci-fi adventure that pulls on the heartstrings at times. It does have some issue with character development but the action as well as the comedy makes fore a fun movie.7.5/10.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This does not allow for a natural build up which would have kept the tension rising. The character build up is raced after the first quarter of the movie. Jennifer Garner had very little screen time and yet she made more of an impression on me than Ryan Reynolds or Mark Ruffalo put together.Also I am tired of Ryan Reynolds playing the same smart mouthed, slightly sarcastic and annoying character in every movie. It's like watching dead pool everywhere (6 underground, red notice). His comedy style is appealing yet overdone.The filming is good when it is not done on a sound stage. The chases and cgi spaceship battles satisfy though bring nothing new.The best part of the movie would probably be young Walker Scobell who awakened the kid within. His energy and comedic timing was enough to keep you from changing the channel.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

But usually his movies have a good storyline with a mildly interesting plot; well this is not the case. Don't get me wrong the movie is not bad, but is most certainly not great. The plot is filled with holes and, like every time travel movie, there are a lot of questions that remain unanswered. The lack of character work makes it impossible to create any connection with them, or even emphasize with them.But, at the same time it has is charm. We are used seeing Ryan as a sarcastic character, but credit is due to Walker Scobell in making such a great job impersonation a young version of him, it makes everything a little more interesting. Not to mention that the movie does what it was intended to do from the beginning, is movie meant to entertain; the movie is a swell diversion for a relaxed evening.It's not the best movie ever, and it won't change anyones life, but I had a great time watching it.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Reynolds, who used to be a likable actor, does yet another Deadpool version of himself, with endless unfunny jokes and maybe a couple of good ones.Playing the titular Adam from an allegedly awful 2050 he goes back to the past, trying to save the planet from that future and in the meantime, his wife Laura, too.Unfortunately Adam is attacked en route and ends up in 2022, 4 years after his target year 2018. Here we discover not only his annoying 12-yo version but also that his dad is the one who invented time travel and his evil associate Sorian the one who fu**ed up the future for the whole of humankind... what are the chances?I mean, one single person destroying hope for 8 billions seems kind of excessive, even if Sorian is a woman and nowadays women can do anything.Several factors make this a disaster, from the mix of multiverse and single universe, where more versions of the same person can coexist, at least for a while, to the awful and excessive CGI, to the fighting champions Laura and Adam and their inept assailants who despite numeric superiority attack one by one...And why exactly Adam wants to save his wife but not his dad?

This movie is average in every sense of the word; high school kid being bullied by bigger kid, whom he'd later be expected to get revenge upon, kid acting like an absolute tool, while at the same time constantly getting in trouble at school, because he's dealing with ""something""... mum trying to reach said kid but can't get through to him, the kid MEGA IRRITATING with a gigantic mouth - that makes it impossible to feel an ounce of sympathy for him after the first knee-jerk, shock reaction, protective instinct to him being bullied - at which point you just wish that that little annoying thing will stop squealing back with some irritating smart-mouthed retort.He comes across as an obnoxious, stereotypically American show-off with a huge mouth!Basic 90's-esque action movie, from an era that we all love. One that is infinitely better than the decade that succeeded it; social-media made everything much worse.BAD CGI...This film evokes feelings of the 90's, particularly rich in love, family and simplification, which is only a good thing.Average movie, highly irritating protagonist, bad special effects, great feelings of the 90's, Jennifer Garner... GORGEOUS Jennifer Garner... gorgeous in every way.If she were mine, I'd NEVER let go.Affleck screwed up, and ended up with one the worst Jennifer's that there is, as punishment for his crimes... and now, all that's left for him is eternal punishment (with a high-maintenance headache of an arrogant, egotistical woman who refuses to age gracefully)
Poor Ben, that'll teach you!!Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!!Oh, and... we love Ryan Reynolds. He's such a nice, wholesome guy. One whom we'd ALL love to be friends with, because you know that he's such a good guy. The same feeling you get from Michael B. Jordan.An average movie, that captures feelings of a bygone era - a time that was so simple and rich with love.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

I think this film goes in so many directions, it's convoluted and hard to follow. Sometimes keeping things simple like how they were in Back to the Future works. The Adam Project was too convenient and cliché. One guy somehow defeats an army and saves the world. I also knew somehow Maya was going to be killed and the villain conveniently gets killed, predictable and dull. This has to be the weakest time travel movie I have seen.

Sadly its the length of the movie that just pushes this movie into the absurd at times.I mean from the offski, Ryan Reynolds sarcastic, Chandler Bing-esque humour gets SO tiring, so quickly in this movie. Ryan doesn't play a character, he just plays himself. There is absolutely nothing to his character at all worth noting about. Most of the time, his lines just don't really fit the movie, or the tone of the scene.The bad guys are horribly cliched, with stupid costumes and angry scowls. You don't need to know much from them besides the fact that some of them look really cheap, in their shiny metal suits, that have a useless invisible cloak to them. Why those henchmen in invisible suits decide to make themselves visible just to attack somebody, I have no idea, they're just stupid and cheap looking. They look like they've come from a Power Rangers Movie.Mark Ruffalo plays a character, and his role only starts like 2/3rd into the movie. His introduction is really quite laboured, as the setup from Ryan playing Ryan leaves little to the imagination what's coming. He's supposed to come across as really smart, but the writing is just atrocious, they use too many worn out buzz words and stolen ideas from other movies.Zoe Saldana, plays a character who's lines seem to have been written by a 12 year old. Throughout the film, her character just appears flat, and unsuprising in anyway. From the moment she was on screen, you knew what her fate was, and it couldn't come quick enough honestly.Everything else about the film? Well the special FX are really cheap looking. You know, explosions on things with no burn marks left. Really awful CGI that looks ontop of something instead of in it. I don't understand how they afforded Ryan Reynolds, and couldn't afford better CGI. The sounds, OH MY GOD, were so cheesy! At any and every point, the humour just felt forced the way stupid sound FX were constantly added in, its so childish. The stupid sound FX made to sound Star War-esque were just groan inducing, as not only does the film use these sounds (Pod racers, light sabers, doors closing etc) they also use some other cliched weapons from the franchise to give the film more retro feel to it. All the fight scenes just felt horribly choregraphed, they were too technical, and not natural feeling at all. The use of so many hand held weapons over a gun, just looked like desperation in this film, I'm suprised they didn't have a sumurai sword in this film, or a Captain America style shield moment (maybe they did, and I fortunately forgot it).Overall I'd say this film was entertaining, but just straight up stupid sadly. You could happily walk out of this movie to make a snack and come and return and miss nothing important. The film is simply too long for its content and basic storyline, you just wanted it to be over much earlier. I really love Sci-Fi films, but this was just dumb to the core, and Ryan Reynolds pretty much ruined this movie, playing Ryan Reynolds in it, instead of a likeable character with a script that actually suited the movie.","3 out of 9 found this helpful.

With films like E. T. and Back to the Future kind of tone. The film is fun. It has action. And some humor and a heartfelt story about father and son bonding.It is fast paced. The film follows Adam (Ryan Reynolds) who travels back to 2022 where he encounters his 12 year old self (Walker Scobell). Which he will need his help and his love interest Laura (Zoe Saldana). Trying to stop a corporation from getting there hands on a time travelling device which Maya (Catherine Keener) is after.The direction is fun and energized. With some great soundtracks added. The action sequences are exciting and entertaining. Ryan Reynolds is great with the role. Walker Scobell is also good. Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner are good. Zoe Saldana is good for her small part. Catherine Keener does feel a little out of place with her villain role.The story and script does strike an emotional journey with a older Adam travelling with his younger self. While trying to correct some of the missed opportunities that the kid is missing out such as cherishing the moments with his parents. It is a great and fun science fiction adventure. The film may skip out on plot development but does have a emotional theme to make this one great journey.","39 out of 107 found this helpful.

The characters are fairly fleshed out.Adam is a fun, fast paced film influenced by Steven Spielberg films. Maybe the odd person feels its too fast. The humor works, I guess at least two scenes were adlibbed.The action scenes are fun, no shaky cam. The action is intense but not too much for young kids. The visuals are mostly good not that I gave it much thought.Overall, Adam is a really good Netflix film! If you like Ryan Reynolds, you really should see it! Adam is a soft PG-13 so kids can see it. Not for nothing but Deadpool 3 should be fun.","12 out of 27 found this helpful.

This is a very derivative sci-fi movie which can make some of those elements a lot less interesting. The kid in this movie basically plays Ryan Reynolds but as a kid so having two Ryan Reynolds is a good or bad thing depending on what you think of him (it works for me in this movie but I can see people definitely not liking it). It gets very melodramatic A LOT in this movie but I think it overall works because there are many good things.This movie is just such a fun movie and Shawn Levy perfectly mixes the great characters with a fun story. The action is great with heart-pounding rock tracks, the gadgets again are definitely seen in other sci-fi movies but it is still fun and awesome in this movie. The kid actor does a great job, Him and Ryan Reynolds are pretty funny and their interactions pretty much make this movie. The science and explanations for the time travel stuff is confusing and it never really matters in the end for you to enjoy the story, it's very easy to watch despite the mathematical blabber. There are a lot of emotional moments in this movie and I think most of them work well and it's very heartwarming and they make you actually care as the characters are fun and don't feel like one-dimensional nobodies.If you have seen many sci-fi movies and are tired of the formula and Ryan Reynolds then this movie probably won't be for you, but overall it was a great time and it worked better for me then I expected.","7 out of 14 found this helpful.

I like Reynolds but the jokes didn't really fit with the tone of the film on a few occasions. I just wish he would try some new things rather than basically playing himself in all these films, as he's clearly talented.CGI effects were pretty decent apart from a fairly ugly deep fake de-ageing effect (you won't be able to miss it).

Walker Scobell is note perfect as a younger version of Reynolds and has solid chemistry with him.Mark Ruffalo adds a lot of humour and emotion to the film and is extremely convincing as both Reynolds and Scobells dad. Zoe Saldana and Jennifer Garner don't get a lot of screen time but are still able to give memorable performances.Shawn Levy's direction is really good with lots of energy and momentum as well as fun and flashy action scenes.

But the rest of the film watchers don't deserve to be put through such an ordeal.The storyline is either too simple or incredibly complex: Go back in time and change the future, in this case by destroying time travel. By now, so many films have been made on that, many quite memorable, that it could be quite interesting to see in which ways the scriptwriter solves problems like: what happens with the memory of people that time-travel? This film always chooses the worst and silliest solutions, for instance: they just forget everything. Ok...Then we have Reynolds playing the smart guy, Buffalo playing the scientist, and so on... so we get the idea: come and play what you did in other films. Young Adam is probably the most successful character, quite cheeky, entertaining and fresh.The film does take some breaks in the action, for the father-and-son conflict mainly. These parts are quite boring an cliche, and I guess not many people would feel moved by it.Is it worth watching? I regret having done it. Those of us who have watched low-budget, poorly-scripted films in the 90s are left wondering why we end up watching a film like this. I guess that the audience is constantly renewed and each generation wants to regret having watched horrible films like this when they were young. So... help yourselves.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The thing with bad time travel movies is that they rely on technical aspects such as CGI, being this movie an excellent example, since it relies on its excessive budget to work. The reason behind this is that this genre of films are only good if they are constructed around solid characters and functioning relationships among them. Furthermore, this is not the case of the movie, since its characters did not have a real objective to attract the audience besides a cliche need of fixing their problems in a way that was hardly believeble.All the problems rooted on the plot of the movie gave as a result a mediocre film that probably will not last in the memory of anybody more than one month. By repeating the same old-fashion patrons of films from the 80s and 90s (that did not work either then or now), Netflix offers us tolerable entertainment if we are up to watching a movie that will not contribute anything new.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

I'll keep it spoiler free and short.This film opens well, it's by no means a masterpiece, but it doesn't pretend to be so no complaints there. The story introduction is a bit silly but told well enough and doesn't drag itself out. Character introduction again doesn't delve in deep, but we meet a typically charming Ryan Reynolds type. There's some witty, family friendly interactions (a couple of bad words but nothing major) and the story kind of rolls on as we have some fun with the lead characters.Then the story develops and for me the whole thing fell apart. Everything became rushed and very typical of a Hollywood action film. Endearing characters became annoying and their arcs became painfully predictable. Guns are fired, things explode and warm feelings are shared.Again the first half is enjoyable and if you are a fan of action scenes and ""dramatic"" storylines, then you may also enjoy the second half. It wasn't for me though and I struggled through the final 45 minutes, but made it in the end... just.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

It's as if someone said let's put all the 80s and 90s music we can in a movie for the boomers who just want a mixed tape.This is just utterly bad. Free Guy was fun and ingenious. This is just stupid and makes your brain hurt.The only reason Ryan Reynolds agreed to make this because someone he loved must have either been held hostage or his mobile phone company just needed money to survive.","3 out of 12 found this helpful.

It is attempting to deal with a higher emotional core than many of Reynolds previous films but it lays it on way too thick. The emotional scenes are so overrepresented that it comes off as manipulative. The humor is stale and relies too heavily on references and the self aware 'wit' that has haunted Hollywood these past few years.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

I knew it wouldn't be going into it, but it looked like it would at least be mindless fun.For starters, its a Netflix original content project, so there's strike one.The cgi is laughably bad. People, Jurrasic Park came out almost 30 years ago. Why is there still substandard cgi in our movies?The writing and story are almost absent. Young Adam buys in way to quickly and easily. The relationship between old Adam and Gamora has no foundation and we feel nothing for her loss.And can we give it a break with time travel as an element of story telling? I don't believe its possible or will ever be realized, but all it serves as in movies is plot convenience. At least Terminator and Back to the Future had respect for the topic while they played with it.With all of that said, it is just a movie and Ryan Reynolds is still enjoyable, but this movie lost me with one line.Kathy Keener's character when talking to her younger self refers to our current environment as toast.For the love of God, will people in the news media, government, and our entertainment media shut the hell up about how doomed the environment is? If people want to start being stewards of our planet, then start acting like it. But put up or shut up.I don't think I can stand to hear another woke ass bit of preachy liberal dialogue in our various forms of entertainment media. Make an entertaining product without telling us what to think or how to feel. If you do want to force an agenda, then make a documentary and see how few people come to watch.When I stop seeing trash all over the sides of the roads and littering parks and shopping areas, I'll start listening to people crying about our doomed planet. When I stop seeing people racing to be the first to have the biggest house or the newest car or the latest technology or seeing every single damn human walking around like a zombie with their face glued to a phone screen, then maybe I'll believe that I live on a planet inhabited by people who actually do care about the environment. In the mean time, we're all a bunch of self righteous hypocrites and some of us think we need to tell everyone else how bad we're treating our home. Fine, preach away. Just don't do it within the scope of my time of relaxation and attempted enjoyment.Damn it anyway.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

After the beep, you are left with a completely uninspiring meal. With the entrée portion still partially frozen and the sides limp and devoid of flavor. The plot revolved around time travel and the risks as well as the cliché concept of running into yourself at a different point in time. This regurgitates an abundance of stereotypical bad action/comedy movie moments. The screenplay and script are worse than an overcooked Hot Pocket with zero redeeming qualities. The soundtrack was an obvious attempt at $9.99 soundtrack sales. The band Boston is a solid band but they used one of their songs for the action scene which was simply a poor song choice; jarring and left me with a quizzical expression as even the lyrics didn't work with the scene. And leaving no cliché left behind, there was even the father/son moment of playing catch on a very obvious set piece. The Van Damme movie I watched previously felt more genuine than this. Had to follow it up by watching ""Her"" for some quality filmmaking as it just popped up on Netflix.","3 out of 17 found this helpful.

All of these actors are capable of so much more. Jennifer Garner plays a great mum but is criminally underutilized in this film (hello anyone remember Alias???!!!). Zoe Saldana kicks tail but isn't in the film much for it to matter. It's especially disappointing because Tropper created Banshee & Carrie/Ana was such a total badass. The script is so formulaic you don't have to pay close attention to it to know what's going to happen - seriously, couldn't Garner have played the scientist??? That wouldn't have been much but it would have been something. The best thing about this film is the obvious chemistry between Garner & Ruffalo and the likeability of all of the actors. Reynolds is solid, doing his thing & the boy they cast was a perfect younger Reynolds. If you've got nothing better to do, then definitely watch Reynolds' obviously play out his Jedi fantasy or put the movie on in the background, but know you've likely seen several variations of this film already. It left me wanting to rewatch Rogue One.","2 out of 11 found this helpful.

A Sci-Fi emotional drama, it could fit into other categories like action, adventure, kids but doesn't actually spend much time on them nor does the writer care about those aspects.The time travel aspect is flawed throughout (just nod your head and accept it because they mention back to the future and terminator), the motivations and plot leading characters through the movie doesn't make sense at any time. The rules of the science are only there to explain the plot and to not make sense. They even poke fun at this multiple times, I can't write and it's funny.If you don't enjoy Ryan Reynolds comedy now you get twice as much. The action is poor and only exists because it needs to be there. If you like heart felt family drama you're lucky that's most of this movie.

The way that Netflix creates new content is so heavily driven by data and algorithms that this movie is nothing more than a mash up of the most popular scenes of other movies.If you're the kind of person who likes those flashback episodes of TV shows where the characters say ""remember the time when..."" and then you're treated to something you remember perfectly well, then you'll enjoy watching Ryan Reynolds sell out for yet another giant bag of cash.If, like me, you find it deeply offensive that your content provider has such contempt for its audience that it feels justified in passing off this glorified clip show as an ""original"" movie, you should give is a wide berth. In fact, you would do well to remember that in general, there's nothing original about Netflix Originals.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

He must work with his 12-year-old self to save the future.The Adam Project presents Ryan Reynolds as the main character giving a hilarious and exciting feel to this film. Meeting him in the past explains how exciting the adventure between them is. The film is wrapped in a light story plot. There are not many monotonous and heavy dialogues. The monotonous thing is just Ryan's jokes and comedy that are so-so. A musty dialogue that relies solely on funny scripts and is full of comedy. Conflicts and problems also run lightly and casually. The adventure presented is also quite fun and entertaining. It's a bit strange to see an evil character in the end come in the final third of the film as if there is a mysterious character being discussed. This movie is like a movie that is enough to entertain. One thing I like, the ending between Big Adam, little Adam and Adam's Dad playing together in the backyard becomes the touching part and the most serious part of the film.It is undeniable that Ryan Reynolds is one of the famous and entertaining actors. His comedic mannerisms and entertaining jokes and monologues have stuck and become his trademark in every film he has acted in, including The Adam Project. It's just that, in this film, there are some jokes that to me sound harsh and not quite right to perform.","2 out of 3 found this helpful.

Ryan and Walker are perfect for this. I like the comedic timing here feels natural to me. To me the time travel aspect is easy to understand.

I expected The Adam Project to be funny and adventurous but what I didn't expect was the touching moments and strong characters. You could argue that some of the more emotional moments were a little contrived, but the solid acting from the entire cast sold the scenes very well.I felt like the Adam Project borrowed elements from Star Wars and then mixed it with Tenet's sci-fi messing with time theme. Overall, it worked and was a good fun time.Walker Scobell, who played the child version of Reynolds' Adam Reed was a true gem! He did such a good job and was 100% believable.Overall, I'd give this an 8/10. It's fun and doesn't take itself too seriously. It's a good 90 minute escape held together by a strong cast.","1 out of 1 found this helpful.

Ryan Reynolds never disappoints me (except that one time, but we don't talk about that). The chemistry between Ryan (Adam) and his costar Walker Scobell (young Adam) is truly remarkable. I think people expect a lot out of child actors these days, and Walker really killed this part!

For a moment, I completely forgot what the real purpose of the film was and focused on its potential; this may have been a study of the main character's traumas in confronting an older, experienced version of himself. See the contrasts that this age difference brings and, above all, the healing process which the two could have faced together... but, I suppose that was too much to ask for a popcorn movie since, from those 30 minutes, the movie becomes what Back To The Future would be in a current context.The Adam Project becomes a movie like any other that is part of the action genre. She quickly loses coherence and her greatest quality begins to relate directly to how disconnected she feels. Especially, during his action scenes, which try too hard to resemble those of a Kingsman movie.However, where it lacks quality most is in its technical aspects. The color-coding looks like something out of a YouTube video, the editing work feels truly forgotten in the background, especially in the last 20 minutes, and, in particular, there's a deepfaked character, which I can't believe was approved in first place.Literally what else is there to say?","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

The main conflict takes time to appear, and due to the short time that the characters have been on screen, it is difficult to connect emotionally with them, as well as there is no good construction of the characters or a detailed development. The performances are not stunning as the actors seem to be playing a role we have seen before, the special effects are decent and the antagonist is undeveloped.This movie fails as science fiction and action, but it can work as a family drama by portraying the importance of always showing what we feel for our loved ones, although it is difficult to ignore the plot so poorly thought out and developed, it is interesting and could be emotionally deep but not enough to recommend it.","1 out of 7 found this helpful.

They don't use guns or flying scooter either until the hero fled away in a car and their meta armor can't even hold the guy's kick.

"5","/10","Another Netflix Original that brings nothing new to the table.","https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8006070/?ref_=tt_urv","martinaaredes","https://www.imdb.com/user/ur151447286/?ref_=tt_urv","26 March 2022","What is truly enthralling about a sci-fi movie that is made with precision is the ability it has to draw viewers in by encouraging them to watch it as many times as they wish and giving them the opportunity to still find details and connections that portray the vast world that has been created to tell the story. I don't know about you but in my case when a movie catches my attention, the first thing that I do after it ends is to browse the internet and explore more about it. But in the case of ""The Adam Project"", I can contend that I didn't experience this situation that I'm describing. The movie included plot holes galore and inconsistency. Time-travel is an overused topic, but can still be interesting when the entire plan has been masterminded, characters are brilliantly developed and you can perceive a unique flavour, which this movie lacked. I sincerely love when the cinematic world presents this certain topic, but once again, I was dissatisfied by the fact it didn't need too much of an analysis.However, it is a Netflix Original, and in such a case, I cannot expect that much. This is the type of movie that you would watch with your friends, family or when you are tired of swiping through the selection of titles offered on the platform.But don't get me wrong, I think there are some positive aspects to remark upon. Both Adams, played by Ryan Reinolds and Walker Scobell, had an interesting chemistry and were capable of matching each other's energy. I will not deny that there were moments that a smirk played on my lips. And then, some action scenes were exciting, as well as other scenes where an emotional touch wanted to be displayed.Overall ""The Adam Project"" wasn't a masterpiece, just a fun and enjoyable, quite cliche, film to watch. In my opinion, I can say it ends up being part of the group of movies that do not manage to enclose such a complex storyline, or that is expected to encounter more details, in the short time that a movie is expected to last, but you can still give it a chance.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Catherine Keener looks nothing like her younger self, which is surprising because over 10 years ago David Fincher was able to make Brad Pitt look whatever age he needed to look in The Curious life of Benjamin Button. This could have been a glorious little achievement in sci-fi, except someone dropped the ball in the special effects department and made it a nightmare. The film ""Being John Malkovich"" is one of my favorites. Everyone who is a fan knows what Catherine Keener used to look like. Whoever did the de-aging of Catherine Keener in this film has never watched her in her previous films and did an awful job of capturing her look her mannerisms and her wit.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

There an underlying theme of family reconciliation and growing up with some fun, over-the-top action to keep it going.Alas, it extends a little too far into the PG-13 realm to be comfortable for the younger set. There is profanity throughout and violence that gets a little bit too personal.There are other parts of the execution that could use some work. The special effects and the action sequences strain believability. The soundtrack feels out of place for the movie. It is mostly rock songs from the late 60s until the early 80s. That may make sense if the movie was set at that time. However, it is primarily set in modern times. Some key scenes would do much better with an orchestral score than the songs that were chosen.There is an interesting storyline in the movie, but it was not carried out as well as it could have.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

There is some really good stuff here. Ryan Reynolds is doing some of his usual stick but he leans into the more dramatic and he's really good. I was very impressed with his performance here. Walker Scobell did a good job at portraying a young version of Ryan Reynolds. The quips and how they are delivered is exactly how Reynolds does it. Mark Ruffalo is pretty good as well. The emotional beats are definitely very effective at points especially towards the end with the final scene featuring the 3 core characters. Really good scene and really good character work throughout. The actual story here is weak. The time travel made some sense at first but fell apart by the end and besides the characters, there wasn't anything about the story that stood out. The third act especially is very weak and anticlimactic. There isn't a strong conclusion and the conflict just kind of ends. There really isn't a great buildup and that was very frustrating. As strong as some of the characters were, others were pretty bad. Zoe Saldana gives a good performance but her character doesn't do anything. She is just there to be Reynold's wife and that's her only purpose to the story and this isn't some flashback. She's essential to the story and then she just kind of leaves. Catherine Keener was a bad villain. Her motivations are confusing and unclear and there isn't any actual character there. Just a stereotypical villain. This definitely felt like a passion project from those involved but it just need its story to be improved and it would have been great. If you like Ryan Reynolds then you'll definitely enjoy this but you could probably pass on this.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

That was the starting point, along with friends having seen it and recommended it highly.Would always have caught it at some point, but the comments by these friends brought it forward, and so glad they did.Interesting premise, time travel obviously done before, but this felt slightly different, but at the end of the day it has fun writing, some great quips (as you would expect from RR) , exciting, and well, the supporting cast, just excellent. Particularly the young Lad playing, well, the young Ryan character.Couldn't give it 10, because, well, keep that for the classically brilliant films as a rule, but of this type of fun, lighter hearted, part sci-fi, action film, well, could not have enjoyed it more.

The interaction between younger Adam and older Adam is really cute and sometimes emotional. Sometimes there is a joke that kinda made me annoyed because it isn't in right place but it's acceptableHowever there is a thing that kinda ruin my experience while watching the movie, the time travel concept. There is some scene that breaks the concept of time travel that is established earlier in the movie (I like when movie have unique and interesting concept/rule in it but it annoyed me when it doesn't consistent with its concept/rule that is established in it)Also the main villain in this movie is hilariously evil and i kinda wish this movie just about Adam's family.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

I cancelled Netflix due to their dark and cancel culture propaganda they started to push in their productions. I have to say it is really nice to see this movie now. I refused a comeback email due to their dark and awful productions in the last several years, so it was really nice to see this movie. I am shocked that such a well produced, written, and good movie would come out of their studios today. Maybe there is hope for Netflix after all, but I'll still wait to see if the change is permanent. The story is a very moving and thrilling movie. It rivals all the great science fiction movies you could think of. Time travel movies have gotten to the point of putting obstacles in the way of the story and this movie breaks those rules in a very well and thought out manner. I am very impressed with the movie and Netflix.I had to look up Catherine Keener to see which her was the real her. I will not say but I was surprised as much as it should have been obvious. I think they did a great job in the look of her in the ... edited version... to make me guess at which one was the real her. It shows how far they have come in digital editing of a person.

instead of comparing something to something else, see if you can appreciate it for what it IS...this movie was HIGHly enjoyable in almost any particular that i might care to dissect it into...so i won't...
learn to enjoy the moment...where you're at. NOW...
i'm going to tell you something else you might not want to hear...this will be the best life will get(unless you're in the middle of something tragic or depressing NOW, but for those of you who this ISN'T true for)...
the future, as you might have already notice, looks a bit bleak...and i'm not just talking because of the pandemic...or variants/mutations to follow...although that started the ball rolling nicely in the wrong/unlikeable direction...in a way that the whole of the human species might actually notice...
but i've been waiting for the OTHER boot to drop for a while...
the economic tidal wave that economists the world over are beginning to talk about...and this situation in the Ukraine ain't helping any...THEY'll tell you that if you just google a bit...
no matter what the govt of the country where i now live might tell their people, the reason they withdrew almost ALL covid rules/restrictions was because the economy was on the brink of failure...
so. The point is...you might be BEGging for entertainment HALF this good in the near future...
but, as it was, it was a LOT of fun...and i'm REALly sorry for you if you can't recognize this...
but DO try and take my advice and appreciate, as best you can, what you have NOW...if you're reading this, trust me, you're not as bad off as sooooo many people...
other than that, i wish you a healthy, long life...whether you like what i said here or not...","6 out of 15 found this helpful.

Lots of things that make you quite sad and I did cry at the end. But also lots of things that are wholesome and sweet. There's a main story and a few sub plots so your never bored. Loved the idea this film had and the dynamic the boy and Ryan renolds had was great too. All the characters felt interesting and the actors did fantastic with what they had.

This movie explores some of the possibilities as well as the pitfalls. It has the love, the loss, the regret, and the hope.The action scenes are top notch, and the quips from Ryan Reynolds are as sharp and hilarious as ever. That being said, Reynolds delivers a performance with layers of depth and emotion, which is a pleasant surprise from Reynolds.Playing the peripheral characters were Zoe Saldana, Catherine Keener, Jennifer Garner, Walker Scobell, and Mark Ruffalo; whose solid performances breathed new life into to a genre we've seen time and again.Whether it's a date night, family night, a night in with friends, or flying solo, this film is built to entertain.Highly recommended.","5 out of 15 found this helpful.

Ryan travels back to 2022 and meets with his younger self to be able to right the correct timeline. Mark Ruffalo acts as the father of time and the boys father while Jennifer Garner is the boys mother. Catherine Keener plays the selfish antagonist who wants to use the timeline to benefit her needs. Zoe Saldana acts as the love interest trapped back in time waiting for Ryan to come back and save her. Overall great storyline with a small cast derived by former Marvel superheroes with beautiful special effects. The script was not as funny but it is a fun family friendly movie.","2 out of 4 found this helpful.

I guess it was meant to be a loving, wacky homage to iconic time travel and sci-epic movies, but the terrible writing just ruined any chance of me enjoying either the storyline or the characters. It's just very disappointingly average, so I couldn't even view it as a ""so bad it's good"" type of film. I kinda wished I didn't sit through this one, honestly.The dialogue was so awkward and unrealistic, especially for the main child actor who attempts to sprout off ""witty"" or ""deep"" jokes and remarks every couple of minutes that just wouldn't come out of any normal 12-year old's mouth. Ryan Reynolds is in familiar territory, I guess, shooting off his usual brand of ""haha XD"" jokes that I just don't find funny (granted the guy looks to be having a lot of fun, you gotta give him props for that). The rest of the actors all give performances as well as they could, but the script just doesn't let any one stand out in any shape or form.The storyline mashes up the usual ""time-travel to save the world"" shenanigans with a healthy dose of space opera action sequences, and it really adds nothing new or interesting to the formula. The fights and effects are all executed competently enough but I wouldn't say it's anything extraordinary, and it does not help that several sequences are riddled with plot holes and logical impossibilities. The movie also tries to blend in some heartfelt family drama with some emotional dialogues and scenes, but once again the execution is so shoddy that it probably could've done itself more favours just sticking with a more focused direction.In conclusion, this movie's inoffensive and light-hearted enough that you could probably just pop it on at a party and pass some time with it, granted you switch your brain off for the duration. But honestly, you would be much better just watching a Marvel movie instead, as it does everything The Adam Project tries to do but much better.","0 out of 6 found this helpful.

I guess she's gotten by with other appeal, but I couldn't watch an actor who is clearly acting like they are acting, doesn't seem comfortable in their own skin, and almost seems like they don't know how real people behave. I really can't handle that reaction she has, it's always the same. Garner has a palette of maybe 3 or 4 different emotions to work with. Sorry, but I couldn't get past this. She was good in Alias, but something like 16 Going On 30 was terrifically cringeworthy, for instance.The premise is fine, and I may go back and just skip the scenes with Garner in them.

The usual not complicated SyFy time travel fun story, but.. I found the relationship between the 12yo boy and his parents very odd! In fact, he was unusual to me.Although not credited with being super smart or gifted in some way, this child is quick witted, silver tounged and able to converse with adults better than we can!His relationship with his parents and the way they treat and speak with him is as an equal and on a level that I wasn't comfortable with.I realise this is the age of internet and over awareness, but this film shows me how children of this time, have been forced to become adults and deal with adult theme and issues due to our technological surroundings, and that the innocence of childhood is over too soon!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

As far as science fiction genre as a whole goes, the movie was meh. Not quite kid friendly but not really fit for adults either. I respect Ryan Reynolds but sometimes his humor or ""larger-than-life persona"" is over the top and in this case it was. I was personally wishing the movie might have ended faster but was stuck watching it with some friends! The overall story, climax, falling action, etc. Are pretty monotonous and employs overused themes. Mark Ruffalo, out of reverence, prevented me from downgrading the movie to a 4, I think. Not the worst movie out there, far from that.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The architecture, inner house design (main character's house) and music all gave credence to the 70's-80's, while tying it to 2022 was strange, but perhaps some didn't pick that up.

I'm not even a casual time travel theorist, but this plot seems to be problematic in so many ways.

He s the funny, snappy, vain, not-caring-about-anything kind of guy. But that doesnt work in every movie and even if it did, that wouldnt be enough to make it an enjoyable experience.They just thought : lets just get Ryan and his joker persona, give him a kid co-star and throw in a woman who will be the maing guys love interest. The plot makes no sense and feels forced, the dialogue is not funny or engaging and the charachters feel shallow. The cast is very good, but they were poorly utilized.Why was Deadpoll a lot better movie compared to this ?A lot funnier because the jokes were original and elaborate with numerous references. Dialogue was constantly having you involved and the plot was otherwise simple, but they made it work because the characters had depth - the good guy wasnt that good, and the bad guy wasnt that bad, so it wasnt one dimensional. Plus the action and the soundtrack were considerably better.In conclusion - not that entertaining and not so much fun.","0 out of 12 found this helpful.

To do this, they will have to find their deceased father, whose death they are still grieving, while running away from time travel guardians because of breaking so many rules.The storyline is not exactly the most original, as the time travel cliche has been used thousands of times before, which makes the movie extremely average and non memorable at all. I do not think it was smartly written, since there are so many gaps in the plot, but at the same time, I understand that the movie and its genre are not supposed to be so deep and just something to watch to spend some of your leisure time.Even though it is not top tier comedy, Ryan Reynolds' character has a wacky and sarcastic sense of humor that made me raise a smirk from time to time, but it is not the most original character and not in the slightest offbeat. In my opinion he is such an amazing actor, and it angers me that he participates in such an ordinary movie that some can consider american trash tv.The movie attempted to be emotionally engaging with the son mourning his passed away father, and even though it was not extremely moving, it added a nice touch to the sci-fi comedy.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Even though they could have done better work instead of relying too much on it. It is not that painful to see, but does lean on the edge of it.Music is OK but just a bit low quality due to low innovativeness, this is also lines and script
Ugg, the script is almost 90-2000's too old school.Love the small humor elements, but sometimes it take it too much, matching the character what is pity because he is the only one that doing the jokes instead the whole movie does it.Action are dump really the same age as the script, even some acting
Do like the amount of details and make it logic again
The amount of details is done above average
A nice element that they have put in is the involvement of the past and future him and his character. Well-made.The men chemistry is really nice, love it.The metal parts are limited, should be more also the door should be the strongest part of the building, but it breaks the easiest.Good plot, easy but good because of some innovativeness.Strange enough, the ending of the machine is much easier than expected.... thought the second scenario will kick in.Ugh love the ball play great work but hate the meeting with his lover moment because it should be different... especially with the dramatic saying goodbye scene.","0 out of 7 found this helpful.

The action was excellent, the fight choreography was well done to the point that you forget that it's choreographed, and the CGI was spot on minus some digital de-aging that could have been better. The interactions between characters ranged from downright hilarious at times to heartfelt and poignant at others. I thought it was well paced, well written, well directed and well acted. I found myself interested and engaged in the movie through it's full runtime which for me is extremely rare.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Even if you turn your brain off to watch this movie, it will still be mediocre.Positives: Good CGI. OK cast. Sort of works as a family movie.Want some good sci fi? Turn on something else.

Every scene I can recall another movie where the exact same thing happened. Ryan Reynolds plays a similar role to the one that he always plays. Some of his jokes hit and others can get annoying. As for cast selection I suppose they did a decent job of finding a kid that one could imagine Ryan Reynolds character to be like when he was younger. The worst part of the movie was some of the sets, the backgrounds look so fake in many parts it looks like old movies where the backgrounds were painted.Time travel movies now are such a common setting and there are so many other movies that have done it better. The movie may provide some laughs throughout , but doing this review even a couple days after viewing it , it is already hard to think of any part that will be memorable a week from now.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This has an LOL factor of zero. Meaning, I never laughed out loud one time and rarely even chuckled on the inside.Can anyone tell me why modern screenplays are filled with characters who treat each other like crap and constantly verbally abuse each other?Are we really a society who communicate with abrasive one liners and leave all interactions unapologetically unresolved???Maybe so. Maybe that's why YouTube videos of people arguing and fighting in public get millions of views.The Adam Project is highly derivative with slightly above average casting, however, as much as I like Mark Ruffalo, he felt a little miscast as the father of Adam...errrr...Adams.Nearly every actor in this film is playing the exact same character they've played before.Reynolds the wise cracking antihero.Saldana the butt kicking heroine (and diversity hire for this film)Ruffalo the reluctant scientist caught between ethical and personal decisions.It would have been nice to see the wonderful Catherine Keener play more than a one note bad guy, but who has time for character development in a movie filled with characters we've already seen before....many times.This is neither a heartfelt sci-fi flick or a dedicated comedy and ultimately fails trying to be both.It's a passable, overlong Netflix film with no real longevity and makes barely a blip in the noisy and chaotic streaming universe where quantity is valued over quality. But what more should I have expected when these streaming platforms still can't get my personal viewing Algorithms right. Netflix thinks I want to watch Shooter with Mark Wahlberg? Really? That's what you've learned about me in 5 years?Nobody will not be talking about this movie in a month. It will be forgotten just like Apple's Tom Hanks sci-fi film, Finch.In defense of Netflix, Don't Look Up, Power of the Dog, and Extraction still give me hope for the future of streaming.....go rewatch one of those movies, you'll enjoy it more.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

It is often said that the best way to define something is to say what it is, and if in this case I don't start that way it is simply because it is simpler and probably closer to a common point to say that it is not bad. Nor is it good. It is, as the title says, junk cinema. That which surely aspires to be nothing more than a moment of disconnection and entertainment. A healthy distraction that takes us away from the sometimes difficult and exhausting exercise of thinking.Project Adam is not a good movie. Its greatest virtue is to entertain, which is no small thing, and I say that honestly, but it relies so much on its strategy, on its forms, that it cannot be said that it always succeeds. It takes risks with characters, and with actors, that can become tiresome and tiresome. Also, with scenes that are a bit forced. Perhaps it relies too much on the names in its cast, but the feeling is that some are on autopilot. Viewed with the right disposition and good humor, it may deliver. However, it's not nearly as good a showcase of the almost always-maligned sci-fi filmmaking. Yes, I know I'm saying again what it's not, but be warned.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

Good script! Even if it's around the ""seen topic""
An experienced director selected according with the topic of the movie and ability.Well known leading actors! Resurrected count!Supporting actors make such a big difference every time ...
A score! Is mostly 50% of the movie...John Williams my all time choice but there's a few good other and new alternatives.Credible and good High-techs based on real science. Without exaggeration!The best photography director you can find.And the hardest part, always trying to contradict or supreme the viewer with the unexpected!And to be perfect, all the project workers really must really believe and love what they are doing, when it's made with love...""we can feel it"" but never without a strong score.This movie gets an 8 because it deserves it and it's my vote of confidence to Netflix...

The kid is a good actor, and he's got a future in hopefully better material than this. You really can't take a Ryan Reynolds movie seriously, because he's the same wise-cracking tool in everything he does these days. I guess you stick with what pays the bills.The writing is instantly forgettable, with the exception of the banter between old/young Adam. That's got funny moments, and the kid delivers the cracks much like Reynolds, so you can see them being the same. The plot is totally outrageous and makes no sense. If you believe in even the most basic of movie time travel laws, you'll realize that had all these timelines actually been breached in this way that they totally screwed up history in three of them. But of course the movie ends without examining any of that fallout. Beyond ridiculous that the future he comes from would be the same.Watch it if you can't find anything better. There's enough to enjoy here without too much wishing you could get the time back.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

That kid has a HUGE future in acting if he wants it.I'm no big fan of action flicks, but to me this was amazing despite having a lot of action sequences. It is actually an incredible blend of genres.

There he meets his 12 year old self, and together they'll attempt to fix an injustice and beat the evil villainess Maya Sorian.Personally I've always loved Ryan Reynolds and his humor, and I enjoyed the similarities between him and Walker Scobell, who plays his 12 year old self. Old Adam attempts to mentor his younger self, and the scenes in which they address how he treats her mother and how that makes him feel in the future are really touching and heartwarming.Even though it attempts to be an action movie mixed with comedy, it isn't exactly ""the avengers"" with RDJ and the rest of the cast, so some of the action scenes and special effects look a little bit forced and unnecessary. There are also some holes in the overall plot, which leave the viewers with questions that might go unanswered.Some people expected a very deep meaningful movie. However, if you see any of the other Ryan Reynolds movies you will notice that none of them are meant to be that deep. They are made to just sit down, relax and have a laugh.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

Definitely.The dream team from The Good Guy has done it again and when you enjoyed that film and like Ryan Reynolds, than you get exactly what you expected. No real surprises here, but luckily no disappointments either.The action is really good, the effects are a blast, the use of songs perfect, it has a lot of heart and is very funny. That's a lot to pull off and just add to that a time travel story that never gets too complicated and actually make sense. Which is nothing short of a miracle.Plus, the cast is a dream. Having 4 Marvel actors in one film is just great fun, even if Zoe Saldana and Jennifer Garner could have been featured a little more. But seeing Reynolds and Mark Ruffalo as a father-son-duo almost makes up for it. And seriously, the child actor they have chosen to play the young Reynolds is fantastic, often unexpectedly stealing the show.","1 out of 2 found this helpful.

The film could definitely work on a tighter theme and story connection for me, but it wasn't like it was loose and sloppy. It was a pretty straightforward sci-fi premise.OTHER THOUGHTS:
Highlights: The interaction between present and future Adam, Zoe Saldana, the pretty solid CGI work, Walker Scobell in general (there's a promising future for him), the small but entertaining relationship with Christos, and the overall pacing of the film for engagement.Could've Been Better: More depth to the relationship between present Adam and his mother to fully understand Adam's flaws to connect to the theme more, Jennifer Garner felt like that random leaf tossed on a sadiddy upscale Michelin restaurant dish (and this is not to say that this film IS that dish...just focus on the random leaf on a plate LOL), and more to the motivations of Maya-her motivation felt so bland and like an easy cop-out in regards to character creation.","2 out of 7 found this helpful.

The dialogue was funny in parts and meaningfully written. The acting was natural and vibrant. The soundtrack and the special FX are creative and ethereal. I loved this movie because it was amusing, inspiring, and original. Netflix has made another good movie amongst the best sci-fi movies I ever seen.Overall I would recommend the movie because what I've learned from it was to ""Don't despise these small beginnings, for the Lord lord rejoices to see the work begin"" (Zechariah 4:10). Especially, with yourself because those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it, but changing the world must first start with the man in the mirror.","1 out of 3 found this helpful.

BUT the flaws in the premise completely dampened any enjoyment of the movie. There are so many time travel movies, the canon is pretty worn out, and you can't make illogical leaps without it pulling the fabric of the movie apart. I wanted to like this movie, I like the cast in most everything else they do, but this movie needed better writing, better direction and a respect for its genre.

The actors are all so charismatic (I really liked. Scobell's performance, and I'm excited to see him as the new Percy Jackson!), the story it's a fun sci-fi adventure, but at the same time deals a lot with family trauma, and has some emotional scenes, mostly when characters are able to some what correct errors of the past, or have a second shot with a loved one.Overall tho, yes, one could nitpick the plot to death mostly likely, it's hard to do a plot holesses time travel movie, but I respect that the movie doesn't even try to explain certain paradox that the time travel element would have created, so I wont go into those details, I respect if you think that makes the movie worst, but at the end of the day I had fun, and I was okay with ignoring some stuff.The CGI to de-age the main villain is... rough tho, I mean, Jesus, that took me out of the movie every time. I rather go the route of taking a younger actress and having make up on her in the future scenes, and herself as the past version, than doing this...Still, I really enjoyed the movie, the action scenes are great, Ryan Reynolds is, as always, really funny (and we even got a Deadpool reference I guess? ""Superhero landing"", which was cool), the movie has a good pace that doesn't make you look away at any point, and a good satisfying conclusion. Really really solid.","1 out of 5 found this helpful.

And while he seems to have been typecast into a certain kind of role for most of the roles he does (with a few notable exceptions that I thought were well done), he does such a GOOD job with that smart mouth kind of character.This was an enjoyable ride right from the beginning. Yes, there are a lot of issues with any time travel movie. And if you're a person who is in it for the science, then don't watch this movie. But if you're in it for the fun, then this is worth the time.Some typical tropes here, but again, done nicely. And some very good banter, some lines I have to make a note of since they were so good that I want to start using them myself.Effects were nicely done as well. There was enough character development to give a little depth without bogging down the movie or going so far you snooze.There wasn't really a moment that I felt I was losing interest. It kept me entertained from the start to the end.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

This is a tongue in cheek semi-comedy drama with a good story really. And its fun it kinda is.If you are over ultra serious anal about your movies this is not for you. But if you like tongue in cheek humor with a touch if ass kicking, save the day kinda movie that tugs at your heart strings with its feel good moments. Then this is the movie for youI liked it and I am the kind of guy who will watch a movie over and over for years I can even recite Animal House word for word.I can see myself watching this movie time to time.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

And I think ANY movie that reminds us to cherish people while we have them is a Very. Good. Thing.I didn't see a lot of weird plot errors, or inconsistencies (which is saying a lot for a time travel film!) and excellent performances were given by all, though I do wish we'd have seen Jennifer Garner more.

Great sci-fi time travel story with a lot of heart and humor. Excellent cast including: Jennifer Garner, Zoe Saldana, Mark Ruffalo and of course Ryan Reynolds' usual charm and hilarious delivery. The young actor portraying 12 year old Adam; (Reynolds) Walker Scobell went toe to toe with seasoned actor Ryan Reynolds and held his own quite impressively. A fast paced fun ride!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

(Garner's multi-decade transformation, urine soaked/not soaked pants, etc..) I found this movie to be one of the best I've seen in a long time, which is awesome!! I was beginning to think I would have to continue to search movies that were produced 30-40 years ago to find those that weren't filled with constant vulgarities and sexual scenes, or inferences, to add expected shock value to get people to watch! What a breath of fresh air!I often decide about how much I like a movie by whether I would buy it to watch whenever I want. This one I would definitely purchase, when it's no longer on Netflix.Thanks for giving me hope that there may still be some good/great movies being produced! :-)","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

How cool is that? WHAT A RIDE! Walker Scobell really pulled it off. The kid definitely has a future in the business.The movie itself is a lot of fun with terrific action and no gratuitous violence. It was well acted and well timed by all of the principals. The part of the older Adam could not have been done by anyone else but Ryan Reynolds. His 'snarky' delivery is spot on.Long story short, very enjoyable and a great 'escape' film.

When adult Adam travels back in time and meets his twelve-year-old self, they join forces to defeat an evil villainess intent on world-wide control. This provides plenty of opportunities for hilarious exchanges. But this film also had poignant moments as both Adams try to come to term with the loss of their father. Their journey together incorporates great themes such as forgiveness, acceptance, love, and being kind to ones self.

because it's.. like I watched, hm, let's say something familiar, or identical..
I kinda wanna share completely different review than I'm going too, but, let's not.But anyway, even if won't make you like me, even if it's going someone in some spheres similar, it's still movie which is going to (if you let deep) makes you think twice about everything, especially your own life,
depends who you are, which age, lifestory etc..
for everyone is going to be different in short I guess.Team was, I mean, Marvels Finest on one place.Ryan is.. he deserves oscar, he's unique, I don't know how would I even describe him, Mark ah cmon, no, no, one good soul which makes you laugh and cry in same time, Saldana no noo nooo, the best in type of these roles in whole hollywood.. fighter, lover, etc.. and mother, so great, especially boy, he was like, ey ey it's..
Blonde Boy is little one version of Bon Jovi,
like, he's gonna be one day Bon Jovi in actors world!Or, he is already.. wauu, and connection between him and Ryan, it was, I have no words..
You kinda see that they worked on,
I think made me, like and appreciate, Ryan like never before, change on even better,
because you can really see that he led him somehow through movie, some father/son relationship,
like Ryan tried (did, end.) to be the best role model he could, and blonde boy paid him back in greatest way,
they deserve oscar for..They were all like one big family, so much connection between all of them, I didn't know to laugh or cry on Ryan Saldana scenes, she tough/serious/fire/lover/control, etc.. Ryan all opposite from that, so they fullfill each other, so much!All of them, whole team, I could watch them like every day, it's one of the best I've ever seen, it's..
like they live every day together and like they are really 100% their roles in real life, it's just.. can't stand it!They need series, long one!I wanna write and write, so much, but..
just go and watch, enjoy,
might even change your life,
views about..
on better I hope so.Thank you Netflix, thank you all who worked on..
You made great! 10/10.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The Adam Project is a nod to Star Wars and Marvel and maybe even a soupcon of DC. This is a feel-good film for families and anyone who likes a good story. The cast is great and Ryan Reynolds (Big Adam), Walker Scobell (Young Adam), and Mark Ruffalo (Louis Reed) turn in performances that seem to be riffs rather than scripted performances.The plots nothing totally new. Reynolds comes back in time to correct a problem in his future, makes an error and accidently meets his younger self, and they need to team up to solve the problem, and some hilarity ensues amongst all the mayhem.Special effects are great but that's the norm today as film has long moved past Fantastic Voyage where Raquel Welch was the special effect. Don't get riled, that was 1966.Ignore the poor reviews and the nitpickers. Time travel does not exist, as far as I know, and all we have are a plethora of make-believe rules that have to be followed in the make-believe story we are watching. Really? Just sit back, have some popcorn nearby, and watch and enjoy the fun ride.","0 out of 3 found this helpful.

At the foreground it has time travel, while in the background there's a steady flow of love: that of a father for his son, and vice-versa, love of a mother, and love for a spouse. Time travel is not a new concept, but this movie makes it great fun. For the past decade, Ryan Reynolds has been honing his own style, which is a blend of quirky humor and superhero athleticism, and I fell he's now at the top of his game. The part of middle-age Adam in this movie must have been written specifically for him, as it suits him perfectly.The rest of the cast is fine too. It goes without saying that Mark Ruffalo is an excellent actor, and the kid is alright. IMO the best component of this movie is the dialogue though, which is very well written, and several times it even brought tears in my eyes. Great movie for the whole family!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

Pursued by soldiers of Maya Sorian (Catherine Keener), the owner of the time machines, he gets shot and lands in 2022 instead. He meets his bullied 12-year-old self (Walker Scobell) who eventually realizes the injured pilot is his future self.Due to the programming of the time machine that disallows operation while the DNA-programmed-pilot, i.e., him, is injured, he has to bring 12-year-old Adam along. When they both go back to 2018, they meet Laura who got stranded to escape Sorian's assassination attempt when Laura found out the future Sorian had been advising her past self to gain more wealth. They also meet their dad, Louis Reed (Mark Ruffalo), who died in 2021 and who realizes the time machine was based on the accelerator algorithm he developed for The Adam Project with his employer Maya Sorian. The three try to get rid of the algorithm. It's everybody's guess who triumphs in the struggle between them and Maya Sorian and her army.This is highly entertaining as well as touching. Adam's psychological scars caused by Louis Reed's death are healed in the course of their adventure. But the message that lingers the most is the realization that time travel would mess up the world and should never be attempted.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

For that you have to agree that the film is probably more of an (action) comedy with slight sci-fi elements than a sci-fi film with comedy elements, because the film doesn't feel real, which I think is because you can a bit exaggerated with the comedy in science fiction films lately (e.g. Also with Eternals). This is particularly noticeable in certain scenes where I think comedy doesn't really fit. E.g. When adult Adam turns off the jet and then young Adam just repeats the phrase ""Oh my God"" over and over at a normal volume. Of course it's quite funny, but in this specific case it destroys the credibility of the reality of the plot. A real-looking reaction for me would have been: ""Oh my God, you're crazy!"" and a little louder and more desperate. Otherwise, the comedy in the film is okay. Which is also unrealistic: Apparently, even Adam's father can't properly shut down the particle accelerator, even when it's intact, even though he invented it himself. Instead, the crystal hard drive apparently has to be removed, which may lead to a meltdown. This is also remarkable, because research was currently being carried out on a hard drive made of nanocrystals in 2018 (where the scene takes place), i.e. There was and still is no finished product that could be used productively as shown in the film. So as I said, no serious SciFi but an entertaining action comedy with SciFi elements.Incidentally, I think it's a shame that more and more large productions are only available as streams and not in the cinema, where it would be much more fun for me personally!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

It seems to me Ryan Reynolds is in a great groove and I hope and wonder if he is going to top himself. So proud that he is Canadian. His choices along with director, actor and story are on point.This film is fun for the whole family. It has something for everyone. I cannot understand how some reviews are negative at all. I think some people see too many movies and become way to critical. I watched this with my daughter who happens to be a great audience and participates when the moment arises. We laughed. We got choked up. We clapped, cheered.This is the kind of movie the creators set out to make. I will say that I thought the first half was better then the second. But just by a very little. Cause it comes to a great conclusion. Because of that my rating is a little low. But not by much. Totally worth the watch. This is not a film to be dissected over it's science facts and believability. It's a movie. A place we go to escape. And escape I did. I hate when people come out of a film like TRANSFORMERS saying how unbelievable it was. Really...you just went in to see a movie about Robot's in disguise? You are not going to get Shakespeare. So watching this film you should know what you are walking into from watching the trailer or reading a synopsis.I had a constant smile from the beginning of this movie and wanted more, and was hoping that it didn't take a turn and become a bad movie. And this is the kind of content we are getting from a streaming service. Wow. I will be watching this again. In fact I've watched any clip that comes up on YouTube which refers to anything to do with this film. I think the young actor in this film did great. And would love to see more of him. And who, who doesn't want to see more of Ryan. Ever since he stepped infront of a camera you knew that's were he was suppose to be. If I could give HALVES on IMDB, I'm so close to giving this film and 8.5. So will say that I give this film an 8-8.5 our of 10. - Toronto, Canada.","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

But seriously, this guy can't go wrong. I hope he breaks out into more dramatic roles because this guy is on the way to an Oscar. And honestly, I don't want anyone else besides him for this sassy characters lol He delivers his comedy so precise it's crazy. This movie is a kids action movie, just some added adult humour. It's a good watch. The perfect pick me up for those lazy rainy days.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The concept of the film is clever: a fighter pilot travels back to a specific point in his life, only to meet (and bond with) his younger self. The always-charming Ryan Reynolds is our leading man, playing the grown-up version of Adam Reed. Reynolds continues to prove he knows a thing or two about being funny. Here, his comedic timing is sharper than ever, evident each time he delivers hilarious lines of dialogue. The pairing of Reynolds with young actor Walker Scobell (who plays a 12-year old version of Adam Reed) creates a fantastic comedic duo. Their dynamic is very enjoyable to watch. They are surrounded by an all-star cast, appearing mostly in supporting roles, including Mark Ruffalo and Jennifer Garner (both should've been given more screen time), and a devilish performance by Catherine Keener as an ultra-villain who you will love to hate. At the heart of the film, this is a good vs. Evil story that feels familiar yet comforting. The film rises above similar movies because of the excellent script (I was surprised to find out that four very acclaimed screenwriters worked on this screenplay; the films feels very cohesive as if it were penned by a single writer and not a team) and terrific direction. The movie moves quickly, never allowing the momentum to slow to a dull roar. Instead, we're at full throttle for most of the film. Levy does allow his actors to have a few tender moments, but bookends them with some awesome action sequences infused with terrific humor. As a result, The Adam Project will leave a smile on your face.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

Absolutely fabulous performance!Do not get your hopes up about the teaming up of Garner and Ruffalo again since 13 Going On 30 as they only share screen time for a minute! And now to the film itself...
Adult Adam steals a jet to travel back to 2018 but ends up in 2022 face-to-face with his 12-year-old self: a small, little bullied school kid raised by his single, hard-working mother. Neither of them disintegrate when meeting, nor does existence end like Back to the Future lore made us believe. Instead, a series of comedic events sees the adult and child work together to solve the problem of time travel.Adult Adam is on a mission to find his girlfriend, Saldaña, but is being chased fervently by his dad's old boss. As the adventure progresses double-crosses, murder and a Biff-esque investment plot becomes known to both the audience and Adamses (?). History will be changed and the future will be unknown once again, I think. The details of ""and then"" are left to our inner detectives to solve.All-in-all a great romp through comedy, action and heart-felt family love.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

The story was just very relatable. So enjoyable. So funny. And who doesn't mind looking at Ryan Reynolds for 2 hours! It's a must watch.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They'd put the dog to work out there, had him cut off door knobs with a truck saw. Anyway this faithful dog starts a new life, his new owners put a healthy picture of Wyoming just over his bed. The dog would alert the men that it was time for lunch with one heavy bark that made the birds outside take flight. Then they would all be sitting in Dennys for lunch where the dog would sometimes also realease a strong bark. If he did, it would usually cause a bearded man (reading the times) to lose a spill of his coffee.

The film stars Ryan Reynolds, Walker Scobell, Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Garner, Catherine Keener and Zoe Saldaña.Time-travelling fighter pilot Adam Reed teams up with his 12-year-old self for a mission to save the future after unintentionally crash landing in 2022.Whatever Film critics say bad about this film i really liked this film. The film has some great acting, some really funny scenes, making most out of a predictable plot, superb use of VFX and a perfect amount of amount of seriousness and humor.The plot of the film is decent yet predictable but the execution is superb. The film keeps you engaged throughout and from no where the film or any of it's scene looks lethargic or forced upon.The screenplay of the film is gripping and has a regular dose of fun in between. The film has all the necessary elements to keep you glued throughout.Acting is superb, Ryan Reynolds is great in his character, Mark Ruffalo is my favorite. Jennifer Garner, Zoe and Catherine Keener were all impressive in their respective roles. Walker Scobell is a surprise factor and really impresses in his debut.The climax of the film is predictable but good and i would like to strongly recommend this film.

In fact it's my least favorite genre to exist, but there's something about Ryan Reynolds that makes me never want to pass up a movie he's in-comedy or not. Not only is Ryan Reynolds the absolute best, but the young boy actor in the movie (Walker Scobell) was able to encapsulate Ryan's personality to a T! Don't take the movie too seriously. It's meant to be fun, lighthearted, full of action, sci-fi, and excitement. I laughed a lot and cried a little! If you're going to watch it with kids, be aware that it does contain profanity, but that doesn't stop it from being a great heartfelt movie!","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

The film surprised me absolutely positively. I'm always a little skeptical about Netflix movies, but here the skepticism was really misplaced.A really great sci-fi adventure film. I especially liked the sci-fi elements, i.e. The futuristic spaceships, the weapons, the fights and the gadgets. The computer effects of the sci-fi elements were also great to watch.I also really really liked the music. Epochal and soulful in equal measure. Really great!Soundwise also pretty good for Netflix standards. Decent soundscape and rich bass and also a lot of surround sound.Ryan Reynolds and Walker Scobell really both did a great job here and obviously had a lot of fun filming. I also really liked Mark Ruffallo here.On the negative side, some of the typical Reynolds fecal humor could be laid out. Sometimes the jokes are a bit inappropriate. But the humor is kept in check. I expected worse. The film can be serious, too, and I liked that.In addition, the film has one or two logic gaps. And here and there the actions of the characters are illogical, where I think: this could have been done much better in a different way.Overall, however, despite the small weaknesses a really great and fun sci-fi adventure film for the whole family! In any case, a big recommendation for all who have Netflix anyway. I would have loved to see the movie in theaters as well, because it would have been worth it.In any case, I will watch the movie more often, because the rewatch value is there.8/10 points - Medium rewatch value.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

However, I'm a big fan of Reynolds and with cast including Saldana and Ruffalo so gave it go. My doubts were based around the workability of a young actor playing a younger Reynolds, and the cheese factor. Scobell nailed it though and owned the movie. Some reviews criticise the special effects and settings, but the film succeeds at being what it arguably meant to be... an enjoyable family fun adventure. Okay the cgi was weak in some places, specifically in the de-aging of Keener which reminded me of the cgi recreation of Peter Cushing in the Later Star Wars movies, however even this fit in with the numerous Star Wars Easter eggs of the film (light-sabres, the forest chase scene). Overall it was a great movie with some real laugh out loud moments combined with some tear jerking moments. The casting is excellent and bounced off each other fantastically. Give it a go.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This movie is filled with nostalgia but at the same time, its new! Young adam is played so well in this movie, to be his film debut is extremely impressive. The chemistry between him and Ryan Reynolds is outstanding, they bring out emotions in each other, they play off each other and act like best friends, brothers and even a father son thing although they play the same part only 28 years different. The chemistry between Mark Ruffalo and Reynolds is amazing, they have some emotional scenes that bring a tear out. Jennifer garner is great as usual in this type of role, she plays a great mom and her role in the film was well done.The action scenes are top notch, the camera work is so good, from fight scenes to car chase scenes, use of drones is amazing now a days, Shawn Levy as director is awesome, he knows how to direct a movie.

In a film with time travel but no look at the future is basically like looking at an awesome crazy sports car and then revving the engine to find out its electric.I also hate it when movies have to have a 5 minute scene of kissing. Its cringe as hell and if you find it satisfying to watch people getting off then you're the type of person who enjoys 3rd wheeling. There is a reason 3s a crowed. If there was people 2 people kissing in the same room as me I aint gonna sit there looking at them so I why the hell would I want to watch it on TV?The film is mostly predictable. However it is a good movie overall. I laughed at allot of the jokes and I am a sucker for special FX. When I see awesome CGI my eyes light up like a kid who has just been given a games console with every video game ever made stored on it. The actors in this film did a great job. I would highly recommend watching this.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

I found it refreshingly honest and poignant while fun and entertaining - which is really why we USE to go ""to the movies"" - to be entertained. The home setting and entire geography ""fit"" every piece of the story. The cinematography was well done.Mark Ruffalo surprised me entirely. The usually serious, intense actor showed a humorous side that was totally fun to see! (Who would have thought?!) The rest of the cast was equal in humor - Jennifer Garner and of course, the charming Ryan Reynolds who spews wit naturally without having to think twice. I loved Zoe Saldana once again; she's just a charmer no matter what role she plays, whether ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" or ""Avatar"" she ""wears"" her roles with real natural talent. Honest to God, its about time we had a movie that was blessed with continual movement in a storyline that is FUN and SHEER entertainment along with subtle messages of fatherhood as well as giving a glimpse of a kid growing up without a Dad - the feelings one has when there is loss of that all important figurehead yet finally becoming a man himself and getting a glimpse of what was and what might have been.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

They either have a pacing or structure problem that makes them basically unwatchable for me.I watched The Adam Project hoping that wouldn't be true and scored big. Disclosure, I like Ryan Reynolds' brand of humor, and it was quite evident here.It's entertaining from start to finish, has all the love stories (father-son, romantic, loving one's self), fighting, explosions, time travel worldbuilding that didn't make me mad, and ***SPOILER*** (sort of but not really) a happy ending that included some very nice wind down/wrap up with the characters.Was it epic? Deeply moving? Nah. But it was absolutely entertaining, warm, funny, and good enough I watched it twice. (Hence my 10 rating; 10s are movies I re-watch).

It makes the 1hour 46minute run time an absolutely rollercoaster of witty jokes, incredible hand-to-hand combat scenes, and a unique take on the theory of time travel. Casting, acting, script, and flow are all very good!Worth a watch!","0 out of 1 found this helpful.

The little Adam was a mirror image of big Adam.. for a young actor to accomplish such a feet was amazing. Good job kid....

There are always going to be plot holes with a sci-fi/time-travel film.

Very enjoyable if you're looking for a movie to be fun, sweet, and family-friendly.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.

This actor directer duo has been doing some great movies. Not the Marvel one yet. DEADPOOL, WE WAIT. But man an awesome time travel movie with a star studed cast. Ryan Reynolds works the best with these kinds of movies you know. The awesome CGI and the way they show those fancy machines. And the time paradox well that doesn't happen in the movie, you can apparently change the past to your own benefit. But not a point of criticism since, time travel is not real yet so don't know the rules. But acting Adam both young and old nailed it. This movie surprisingly had all elements to it, from romance, action, comedy and even drama and the sad emotions when you realize how you treat your mother is not something you consider,one of the most emotional scenes. Mark Ruffalo and Ryan Reynolds chemistry works out surprisingly well, the Punch on the face. Maybe hope for Hulk and Deadpool adventure. Zoe Saldana and Ryan also a good combination. The villain was a bit ok and ordinary but every other aspect of the movie just pulls out so much. Another one of RR hits after 6 Underground, Red Notice and this one. And for Shawn Levy great job after Free Guy, looking forward to the completion of triology for Deadpool and your duo.","0 out of 2 found this helpful.

This is the epitome of ""stuff you put in the background as noise while you do something else"". Many cite visuals as its saving grace but Im not sure what impressive visuals people are talking about, it might have been impressive 20 years ago but I have seen same quality on tv in 2010. Then there is also the limited amount of those visuals, if you just want eye candy than there are vastly superior options out there when it comes to pure visuals.The movies problem is not that its concepts/characters being dated, its in execution of those tropes. There is clear lack of effort on the writers part.","0 out of 0 found this helpful.
